    "text": "Authentic Mexican fast food! tt looks like it took over an old Wendy's from the architecture of the place. As soon as I saw that this place was packed with Mexicans, I knew this place had to be good.   Right when you walk in, you see where you walk up an place your order. Everything is prepared on the spot, as efficiently as a Chipotle assembly line. You see the meats cooked right there in front of you so the aroma is mouth watering. Your first stop is the guy serving up adobada which he slices off a skewer and you see all of the juices running down.  I ordered four different tacos: adobada, carne asada, lengua and cabeza for about $2 each. All of them were generously filled with meat, onions, cilantro and sauces. The corn tortillas are made fresh as is everything else.   All of the meats were tender and flavorful but the standout star was adobada. I made the mistake of eating that first, and although all of the other tacos were good, they paled in comparison to the amazing adobada taco.  I had the flan for dessert and it was good, not the best I've had but worth getting if you have a sweet tooth.   I'm sad that this place is all the way on the other side of town. I won't be able to go to a Roberto's or Amigos Tacos without comparing them to the yummy goodness that is Tacos El Gordo!",

    "text": "The million other reviews for this place sum it up nicely: Tacos El Gordo is awesomely delicious.  As prior reviewers have said, the superstar is the adobada.  The adobada line is the closest to the door and always the longest for a reason -- it's a flavor explosion.  Just make sure you ask for the pineapple and everything on it, those little additions just put it over the top.  My other faves are the carne asada, suadero, and lengua.  If you're in the mood for lengua, I'd suggest refraining from ordering the other tacos.  The simplicity of the flavors in the lengua taco -- complimented with just a sprinkling of cilantro and onions--might get overwhelmed if you flank it with an adobada which has a lot going on.   The price for this place is also phenomenal.  I'm always stuffed after two tacos, which are $2 a piece, for a grand total of $4.00 plus tax.    My mouth is watering just typing this review...maybe I'll head out there for lunch...",

    "text": "Man, I love tacos. One day I decided that in order to find the best tacos in Las Vegas, I needed to eat at every highly-reviewed taco place in town. I started off at Los Tacos on Sahara, as it's closer to my side of town and consistently the best place to get delicious food. I love it there, but we're not talking about that right now...  I finally made my way to Tacos El Gordo after hearing increasingly good reviews about this place. I'd love to tell you not to listen to the hype, but LISTEN TO THE HYPE! THIS PLACE IS GOOD!  First of all, you should know this place is called Tacos El Gordo for a reason: it's pretty much just tacos. Don't come in here expecting a Taco Bell-like menu of made-up \"Mexican\" meals... nonsense! It's just tacos here, and great ones, at that! (It's not really \"just tacos\"... they have like three other things on the menu, but that's just because they're based on a taco-like construction)  I come here and always order the same thing: \"Hola, me puede dar cuatro tacos de asada?\" Yes, I ask for four carne asada tacos, and I always have to talk myself out of getting 5 or 6 or 14. The tacos are amazing here. Plus, you can watch the lady make fresh tortillas right in front of you! It's awesome! It really just ups the ante here!  Again, the food here is good, quick, and cheap ($2/taco). And it's extra cool because you can grab your food, then go up and pay for it after. It was confusing at first, but it works.   My only gripe with this place? It's right next to the classic Los Tacos. I feel that Los Tacos has better carne asada, and their menu is a lot more varied, but it's in a different category. Los Tacos is a lot more bare-bones deliciousness, where Los Tacos. It isn't really a weakness as much as it highlights how basic this place is.",

Honestly the food was not that good. Very disappointed. Asana tasted plain and the asada fries were gross. It's not worth it. I should have known when a lady in line said it was whatever nothing to brag about. And the employees are thieves, a lady sitting eating dropped money and an employee walked by and picked it up and put it right in her pocket! That is so dishonest. Smh.

    "text": "If you want a life changing experience, the tacos from Tacos El Gordo will do that for you. Sinking your teeth in one of their succulent, flavorful, tacos will blow your mind.   Tacos El Gordo is straight up authentic Mexican food at its finest. When it wasn't very dangerous to venture to Tijuana, MX, I would easily drive 10 minutes south and go to Tacos El Gordo to get my taco fix (also because it was cheaper than getting it 10 minutes north from where I lived in SD, in Chula Vista, CA :P).  As a SOUTH San Diego, CA native, and having experienced the many taco shops that saturate the SD area I've had to settle for OK Mexican tacos in Las Vegas, NV or even avoid considering tacos as an eating out option. I guarantee Tacos El Gordo is THE best tacos you'll find in town because it's seriously the best in SD and I find it an awesome relief that they brought the best to Las Vegas.    Since I'm a carne asada fan, I've only had their carne asada tacos and tostadas. The flavor and spice of their carne asada is so delicious and they grill it to perfection! The employees here are just pros at grilling and flavoring the meats to perfection. My fiance is all about the pork adobada! He scafs down his order in a ridiculous amount of time; he'll finish 4 of those tacos faster than I can finish two.  Pros: the hours of operation--it's better than in San Diego! :P and it's authenticity is further accentuated because it is situated in a similar, run down area to that in South San Diego. Unlike other places where they tend to put less meat and more of the other items, Tacos El Gordo loads it up with lots of meat and a great balance of the toppings (onions/cillantro/guac etc.). Lastly, their red and green salsas are the s**t!!!! (tasty with the right amount of spice!)  Cons: far from where I live in Las Vegas and the prices are a little bit expensive than in San Diego but comparable to other taco/mexican food places in Las Vegas and they don't offer seafood options for those who crave shrimp or fish tacos as an alternative to the land animals.  Hope you anticipate spending most of your money toward this awesome goodness and turning into a TJ taco fiend. :)",

    "text": "No need to be scared. Read the menu, figure out what you want, and get in the designated lines to get your tacos. The idea of splitting the tacos into groups and getting people to order from a certain person is genius. Instead of one long line, the customer can bypass it and just get what they want before heading to the cashier to pay.  Yet again we were the minority. I am beginning to enjoy this. When the menu does not tell me exactly what I am eating and the other patrons are of the ethnicity, the food must be A1. I came here with my sister and some of her co-workers. Since she is about to leave town, we have been knocking off her bookmarks in blocks. Today, it was time to get some tacos that have united the Yelp world.   My fundamental Spanish was enough to understand that I wanted tongue and head meat filled corn tortillas. They are definitely the stand out of my meal. The meat was tender and melt in your mouth. No gaminess and all flavor. I could eat a tray full of these alone. Then my sister got the shaved meat and carne asada. The Adobada is just as good as everyone has made it out to be. With the shaved pineapple only makes it that much better. The steak taco was nothing spectacular and was my least favorite. I know now that it is all about the leftover proteins. If I stick to these, it would be a solid meal. Add a horchata to wash it all down and I have never been happier. Four tacos and a drink was only a little over $10.",

They should be called Tacos El Garbage!! Anyone who thinks these tacos are the best should be deported to Mexico just to experience what a real taco tastes like. The carne asada was dry as fuck and the worst part was that before the food hit my mouth you could taste the flame off the heat from the propane! Seriously my tacos tasted like lighter fluid!!! Hank Hill would've shit 4 bricks because he would've preached \"Taste the meat not the heat!\" Biggest waste of $20. For the extra $6.00 I should've gone next door, literally 5 steps to the right to Los Tacos and had real tacos that taste way better than the shit I just ate. Such a long wait in line for nothing. So like they say don't knock it till you try it! Yup, never going there ever again!!",

    "text": "When planning my trip to Las Vegas I did my usual Yelp scoping of the local food options. As soon as I saw Tacos El Gordo, I knew I wanted to go. Immediately I described this place to my boyfriend as the Katz's Deli (<a href=\"http://www.yelp.com/biz/katzs-delicatessen-new-york\">yelp.com/biz/katzs-delic...</a>) of taco shops.  Just like Katz's, you get in line for the meat you want and watch as your food comes together. It is almost like dinner and a show. These guys are talented. Hand making fresh tortillas. Chopping and slicing meat. Tossing salsas and sauces onto the tacos. Those guys are good and they are fast!  I tried the adobada and asada tacos. The adobada was beautiful on the spit. The meat is sliced off directly from the spit into the tortilla. The meat was succulent and flavorful. The salsas complemented the pork well. The tortillas were just slightly greasy and cooked from the flattop. The asada guy was busy flipping and chopping piles of asada. Flip flip, CHOP CHOP CHOP CHOP. The meat was thin and chopped well. It had a nice grill flavor too. This taco was topped with cilantro, onion, and a light green sauce. It was good but not as good as the adobada.   The place was packed on a Sunday night. There are taco shops on every block on Charleston so clearly they are doing something right!",

I cannot complain as there were a few people ahead of me and they ask your name and the staff are so professional and amazing! Made me feel as though I was whisked away back south of the border. I've been to Mexico many times mostly to Guadalajara, loved it! Anyway, the food was flavorful and hot and Asada Fries I ordered were so delish the best I've tasted. Although there was a bit more guac then I am used to but that doesn't merit losing a star in my opinion! I am chowing down on my two tacos that I ordered! If I didn't want the Fries I would've gotten like 5 tacos! I mean $2 each and they are so unique and yummy, how could you go wrong?

    "text": "Very excellent taco shop serving up yummy, made with love, authentic street tacos south of the border right here in Las Vegas.  OperatingHours: M-Th 9am-2am F-Sat 9am-4am  I am pretty adventurous when it comes to food, and will try most things at least once plus willing to make the trip to get it.  So after spending too much time in the school library and still needing to find a good late night spot to eat, I somehow found the Yelp reviews for Tacos  El Gordon on the East side of Las Vegas.  The reviews were all positive, and the pictures posted helped cement my decision to drive 40+ blocks down Charleston to find this tacos heaven.  The place was not difficult to locate, as it was a corner unit facing the E. Charleston Blvd.  The restaurant is well-lit inside, with modest decor but the tables, side garnish and drinking fountain stations are spotlessly clean. Even at 10:45pm on a quiet Wednesday night, the lines in front of the ordering counters seem to swell and ebb like the motion of the distant oceans.  Luckily most here are old pros at ordering the tacos and the lines moved quickly.  Even though I felt like a tourist visiting Mexico here, the friendly gentleman at the Adoboda station greeted me warmly with \"what can I get you my friend?\" and helped me translate their fairly straightforward and simple menu, he even helped my placed the rest of my orders at the other station when he was done fixing up my two Taco de Adobodas.  By the time I was at the cash register, my red plastic tray is brimming with 6 tacos (2 Adobodas, 2 Asadas, 1 Chorizo and 1 Lengua), a plate of the grilled scallions and roasted pepper and a cup for their bottomless Horchta ($1.40) all for just under $15.  Pretty sweet deal for what many reviewers are saying as very authentic Mexican street tacos.  I am no taco expert, but a restaurant filled with paying Mexican and Hispanic patrons is a great endorsement and what I look for when seeking a taco shop like this.  Tace de Adoboda - (\"Shepherd's Style\") Spicy pork with adobo seasoning slowly roasted like, and shaved off the rotating skewer into the freshly prepared homemade hot corn tortilla and topped off with the sauces, onions, cilantros.  I enjoyed this the most.  5 stars!  Taco de Asada - Basically a carne asada taco with the regular fixings.  Taste was just okay for me, the portion of beef was generous but I felt it was a tad dry.  3 stars.  Taco de Chorizo - Made with the firmer chorizo and not the kind that melts into a poodle of grease and spices.  Others don't seem to care much for this taco, but I thought it was good.  4 stars!  Taco de Lingua - The \"tongue\" taco.  I really want to like this more, but it was just a little salty for my taste.  Otherwise the portion of the beef tongue was also generous.  I will still give it another try.  2.5 stars. The grilled scallions and roasted pepper was good and the lady behind the counter really filled the plate for me, even though I only needed like  of the scallions.  I might have used more if the scallions were chopped up, but I will chalk that up as being the traditional and authentic way it is served up at the street taco carts.  Oh yea, the tacos here are not big and can be disposed off easily in 3-4 normal bites, but at $2 each (plus tax) and with the generous meat toppings, it is a still good yummy deal.  Decor:  2/5  Very modest, but you are here first and foremost for the food, right? Food:  4/5  Overall, very pleased with the tacos here.  If it is closer to me, I will likely be here at least 1-2/week, alas that is a lot of traffic lights to drive through at 35mph. Service:  5/5  For a low cost and unpretentious restaurant, the service was friendly and fast. Cleanliness:  5/5  There is something to be said about how the staff here keeps the busy front of the restaurant area spotlessly clean.  Very nice! Parking:  3/5  May not find the closest parking spaces but there are many in this strip mall. Location:  3/5  Located in probably not the best part of town, but it is in a location that is surrounded by the bulk of their targeted demographic and on a heavily traversed street no less.  Perhaps a bit out of the way for those living on the West side of the 15, but the drive wasn't too bad later in the evening once the traffic dies down.  4 Stars!",

They'e the smaller \"street\" tacos, but in my opinion, are made the way tacos are meant to be eaten.     Because the tacos are smaller, it's advisable to order at least three -- or more if you're a hearty eater.  I, of course, recommend the carne asada tacos.  The pork adobada is also really good.  Also, try the mula; it's quesadilla meets taco.  I'm not quite sure why the carne asada french fries are $10.  In San Diego, carne asada french fries are $5, tops.  However, if you're feeling like a baller, the french fries are also an excellent option.    The place is very casual (read: not fancy), but authentic as it comes in  Vegas.  In short, it's well worth trying.",

You have to try the pork tacos, it's on a big spin wheel similar to gyro meat. It's seasoned with pineapple. So good, so authentic. Never had tacos this authentic before. Can't wait to go back!",

Adobada was good too but the line was at least 30 minutes long due to their inefficient ordering system.   Adobada and al pastor line were separate from the 2 other lines. After u order your food they give it to you and u have to stand in ANOTHER line to pay for the food. It's stupid. Oh and the tacos are over 2.00 each.   I'm glad I tried it but I won't be coming back any time soon.",

My favorites are adobada, lengua, sesos, carne asada, and all of them simply PERFECTION!  $2 each, and I can't get myself to eat less than 6-10 of them when I'm here.

The place is set up very uncomfortably with their tables the way they're set up. Forget about if you need something extra you forgot?

    "text": "Oh. My. Gordo.  When I see a spit full of deliciously spiced and marinated pig slowly rotating and being carved by a dude with a machete, I get in line. Immediately.   Here at Tacos El Gordo, there are lines for their different meats: carne asada on the left, lengua and others in the middle, and al pastor on the right. Let's cut to the chase: get in the line on your right. The al pastor/adobada is PHENOMENAL and worthy of an ALL-CAPS adjective. Perfectly seasoned, tender with just a bit of char on the exterior, it's served on a warm, freshly made tortilla. Don't forget to ask for grilled jalapenos, onions, and pineapple on the side.   The lines are long, but they move quickly. After you have your tray full of tacos (or fries, mulas, sopas, quesadillas, or tostadas), go to the cashier and pay. You also buy your drinks here. It's your typical taco shop ambiance, casual and divey, yet clean and friendly. On our initial visit, my wife and I were wandering around trying to find  seats when one of the workers cleared out a space near the cash register just for us. Excellent service!  Ignore the reviewers complaining about the $2 per taco price tag. Each taco is generously filled with al pastor that is much better than what you'll find at your typical restaurant or truck. In fact, I'd bet that these same reviewers would gladly pay $2 for 2 tacos with less meat (and of lower quality) because it sounds like a better deal. It only takes one taste of Tacos El Gordo's al pastor to know you're getting your money's worth and then some.   Highly recommended.",

I saw this place was not too far from my location, saw the Yelp reviews, and headed over.   I must have hit it at the right time because there was zero line.  I knew from reading I had to order based on the meat I wanted.  I chose then spicy pork and one asada taco.  The meats were sliced, the tacos loaded, and off I went to pay.  Got a drink and it was less than $10.    Wow wow wow. When I first bit the asada taco I knew I had found taco gold.  I have had asada before but never this good.  Everything was fresh, crispy where it should have been, and soft where it needed to be.  The asada had a saltiness that was a perfect compliment to the meal.  The spicy pork was not blow you head off spicy.  It had heat, but nothing that was overwhelming.  I enjoyed my meal so much that I considered, more than once, driving back to have this for dinner.  After all, the sign on the door says open at 9:30 until late.  Oh, be certain to get your tacos with everything on them.  You won't be sorry.    The restaurant was clean, bright, and decidedly ethnic. The prices were great and service friendly.  Don't miss the lime and radish bar next to the beverage dispenser.  I tell you what, if you miss this gem when visiting Vegas, you missed some of the best eating there is.",

I also have found a new favorite: Vampiro. So good. I think I'll be getting that next time I go there. A crunchy outside, with awesome adobada meat, topped w/ other ingredients that just went so well together.

People in Chicago rave about tacos and Mexican food but it pales in comparison to this place.  Order the cabeza tacos. Sure, it sounds disgusting. But I love head! *insert dirty joke here* No seriously though. The meat is moist, sweet and delicious. The perfect taco.  Also, be sure to save room for some adobada mulas. I never knew what a mula was until I came here. Basically, it's a quesadilla version of their taco. SO GOOD!  This location is open until 2am on the weekends so do yourself a favor and make a stop here. Leave the club early if you have to. It's worth it.",

The service here is very quick and efficient, and they are open until 4am which is a big bonus for all you night owls.We stopped in after the Yelp Burstday celebration at the Stratosphere and it wasn't packed at all. We got a little bit of everything-Tostada, Lengua, Cabeza, Crispy Tripas(My favorite here) and the fan favorite, adobada.  It definitely hit the spot and cured our taco cravings for the evening...ALOHA!  YELP 365 CHALLENGE-(211/365) \" Plan B for Tacos\"",

    "text": "I've known about this place for sometime and finally went.  Went to the Charleston location and made the mistake of coming here on a Sunday afternoon. The wait was over an hour, and we had to make friends with people that were already eating to secure a table for when we got our food. BUT it was well worth it!   Here's what we got: Carne Asada tacos-average. I think they only had it on the menu to offer something familiar to the people that usually go to robertos Lengua (tongue) tacos-very tender and beefy flavor Tripa (intestine) tacos-fried and crunchy, a little greasy, tasted like pork rinds. Good, but are probably better after a night of drinking Adobada (marinated pork) tacos- delicious. The green sauce on it made it so much better Adobada quesadillas- same as the tacos but with melted cheese. Good, but I could have done without Suadero (beef) tacos- by far my favorite. Whatever they marinade/season/cook it in is amazing  There are 3 lines and each one only makes specific items. One strictly for adobada and the other 2 have a mixture. You order/pick up your food at the window cafeteria style and take it to the left to pay and get drinks. The employees hustle. They definitely have a rhythm about what they do. We spent quite a bit, but as you can tell,'we tried a lot. If you go in knowing what you want, it's pretty reasonable.   While in line, we talked to a few people that were out of towners. Surprising to see how many there were since this place is nowhere near the strip. The new location is even further.  Overall, great experience and will definitely be back time and time again",

So sit your culo gordo down and behold anything from spicy pork, to brains, to tongue, to beef and everything else. My faves so far are the choritzo and the spicy pork. A couple of yelpers have poo pooed the chorizo, I likey. At 2 bucks a pop, this qualifies as some exceptional cheap eats.  Bonus for the gratis grilled jalapeno peppers and green onion, the fresh radish and lime station, and the free drink refills.",

You need to see a small sign indicating what station it serves, for instance the carne asada tacos are in one line and the pork tacos are in another.   It was really packed inside and the lines were long. Once I got my tacos it was all worth it.  I had 6 carne asada tacos (they are small) and they load them up with qacamole, cilantro and onions. Make sure you ask for the jalapeno and onion side.  I will be back here, Fyi there is another location on the strip, however the lines there are huge.  Down fall is they need to move the fountain drinks to a different location. They keep them in a tiny corner next to the kitchen door. It got really packed in there and I had to wait a while for people to get out of the tiny corner.",

It's meat so tender it'll make you wanna slap ya daddy AND ya mama!    I had the massive carne asada fries, but I didn't know til after that you can get any type of meat you want on top of the fries.  I would have got their suadero. It's that good!  I usually just get the taco's now and maybe a sopes here and there but mainly the tacos.  It comes with grilled onions on request.  It always seems like they're constantly cooking, maybe because it's always so busy.",

Enjoyed the tripe, was surprisingly tender and didn't have that offal taste.  Spicy pork, not really spicy, chorizo was good, not as oily as some other chorizos that i had tried..  For condiments, they had lime, radish, and salsa.  I would eat here again.  Tacos are good.",

They don't make the tortiillas hand made instead they were using \"El Super\" tortillas which are very nasty and dry. The tacos were really small and I had asked a lady for some onion and she kept ignoring me. I kept calling her and she would look at me and ignore me. The quesadilla was not even a quesadilla it was a cheese taco NOT WHAT I ASKED FOR!! The quesadilla had a hard tostada on top and I was not able to bite it without hurting my teeth. I was trying hard to enjoy my cheese taco but I couldn't because at some point it started to smell like rotten meat. I would not recommend anyone to come here , I don't understand why everyone saids it's good. I rather go to tacos de Gavilan.",

The Charleston location is my favorite one, I feel like the service and the tacos and different from the other one. It can be a little pricey, however I would rather pay extra for something that's good than something that is alright. Even though there's always lines, the service is pretty fast. The only thing is the struggle finding a place to sit and eat. Last time I was there we just sat on the tables they have outside.",

    "text": "FINALLY had Tacos El Gordo on the last the trip to Vegas. I've had many friends tell me I gotta try it but we never made our way to it until recently. We opted to go to the Charleston location with a big group who all had not tried it yet so that was cool. It wasnt too long of a drive from the City Center where were staying for the weekend.  So indeed you wait in line for the meat you want, as other Yelpers have pointed out. We wanted mainly pork adobada tacos so we were posted up in that line. Al pastor was also available there so that was good. It was probably the longest line at that time. So you can order tacos, mulitas, quesadillas, sopes and the loaded fries as long as they're of whichever meat is served in that specific line.   I really liked the adobada flavor. It's different than what I usually have. It had great stewed-in flavor and I like that. The al pastor was also very good. Great flavor on that meat... I also went in line for the suadero tacos. That's the middle line which was generally empty when we were there. Maybe it's because they also served sesos and cabezas in that line. Haha... I get it. Might be too crazy for some folks. But i'm sure they do those well too... The suadero tacos are very tasty. My understanding is that suadero is rib meat and it was real good. Moist not dry. I liked it a lot. The campechana fries are a monster. And at $13 is a meal in itself.  Plenty of parking in a shared lot. It's a bit down Charleston so keep driving until you see the shopping plaza on your right side if you're coming from the Strip. Bring your patience... Wait in line. Order your food. Wait for your food up front... And pay all together at the cashier.",

    "text": "This place is a must-go! The reviews here are no lie. I hear the branch on the Las Vegas strip is better but I was already very impressed by the downtown branch. The tacos here are freshly made, both meat AND tortilla! Average price per taco is about $2.25, which may sound slightly expensive compared to taco trucks in LA, but it's definitely worth it! Each taco contains a LOT of meat. Not only that, but they give a very generous amount of guacamole per taco. All that combined with the rich flavor is reason enough why they're so well known! Be prepared to wait in line for at least 30-45 minutes though, especially for the Al Pastor. I personally did not try the Al Pastor because the line hadn't moved for a good 15 or so minutes and I was hungry so I will definitely be back to try this in the future! They also have Asada Fries for $13!  My advice: Eat the food you order from here as soon as you get it. It definitely does make a difference when you eat it fresh vs when you pack it up and eat it back at your hotel 15 minutes later!",

We ordered 4 tacos. Which by the way for 4 were 9 bucks on a taco tuesday. They were so tiny, I could have went to El Pollo Loco instead and got an entire meal that was worth having.  I got the carne asada tacos. The taste was wayyyyy too salty and cold by the time I bit into them. Sad to say, I gave the rest to my fiance. It is more sad cause whomever thought this place was worth rating a 5 has NEVER had authentic Mexican food from real Mexicans. As a matter of fact, go to Lindo Michoacan, thats where its at. Or if you want, go to the bay area and so cali where the real Mexican food is worth paying for big portions.  Even I can cook better. Will not be back.",

Especially Senator Hilary Clinton came just for their food and the Hispanic community.   They did sort of renovate a little by maximizing seating space and placing the register to one side of the room as the drink dispensary and condiment bar is on the other side making space accessible with no crowds.  They have 3 lines for certain orders that make it productively fast. They do dine in and take out orders. They have a fountain drink dispensary and bottled or can drink vendors too.  If you're a real Hispanic food enthusiast, you have to get their signature Horchatas! Or Fanta sodas lol.  Also, you can't forget the complimentary salad bar (sauces, sides)  and condiments for your order.   Today I ordered 4 Small Adobada Tacos and a small box of Al Pastor Fries which came out to a total of $17.    To me, that was way too pricey for a small portion. I do admit the Fries are big for a small order but they are not generous on the Al Pastor meat. I had way too much fries and too little meat on my plate. - if you do decide to go and get their Fries, make sure you tell them to put more meat in the meal. Let's see if they don't charge you extra for that lol.   Overall, I still love their food. It would satisfy me if I could taste more of the meat I ordered for my fries",

Just sitting there not being patrons.  We told them to move and they didn't. The staff didn't help at all.  They were four other patrons looking for seats. The staff did nothing. To those kids.  The security guy just stands by the door and doesn't do anything for the business. Management needs to put up signs that people need to get their food and then sit down. Not have a person getting a sit and they have people looking like idiots looking for seats and there people sitting with no food waiting for people to get food.   I hope the business contacts me. If they don't I try emailing them or else I'm done with this place.",

    "text": "BS +++  Apparently one of the GO TO spots in Vegas after hours or during lunch to experience real Mexican  food (not Tex Mex).  This place is in the heart of Eastern Vegas but close to Downtown.  It's a spot I wouldn't think would serve bomb tacos.  But boy was I wrong.   At 1:40am we stroll in with 20 minutes left before closing.  I would think the cooks would be pissed but damn were they all smiles and happy.  There were still people strolling in.  Let me just say the taco meat is amazing. It's on a slow spinning cooker and the guy slicing the meat is precise.  The ratio of meat to veggies is on point.  The food was just right and it was worth the 12 minute drive - speeding through the highway.  I loved how clean and organize this place is.  It's also very clean and the staff are super nice.  I recommend this hands down as one of the True spots of Vegas.  If you are a foodie.  A True to life foodie - you have to experience this restaurant.  The options are amazing (tacos with various meats) and other Mexican staples that will make your panties fall past 12am or during lunch.  This place is famous and I say if you ever go to Vegas go visit one of their three locations.  I highly recommend trying their sodas.  So many great flavors!  Location is CLEAN, NICE, NEW Staff SUPER NICE! Parking lot is SHARED and HUGE Restrooms Did not use Seating is Nice and Clean Pricing is A BIT EXPENSIVE  * Boomsauce scale. BW = Dis $@% is BASURA! (Garbage). Not recommended. BS = it's just O.K. (experience) BS+ = Yo! I like this place. BS++= That's Whoa! This place good. BS+++= Dayumm! This place is fkn DOPE!",

Tacos al pastor topped with pineapple were my favorite. If you havent been here, theres no time like the present. AAA +++",

    "text": "Back home in Hawai'i, we call it \"kanak attack\" and according to Urban Dictionary, kanak attack is- The feeling of intense laziness that one gets from eating too much. Yes, this is exactly how I felt after eating at Tacos El Gordo for the first time. These tacos hit the spot and definitely put me in a food coma not too long after!  I've lived in this crazy city for four years now and I'm JUST trying this place out! Tacos El Gordo did not disappoint.   If it's your first time here, prepare to be overwhelmed. The organization/set up of this joint could use some improvement, but the staff here is efficient and keeps the lines moving. There are three separate lines for the different types of meats offered, so make your decisions quickly because the lines grow fast!   The fan favorite (and my favorite) is definitely the Adobada Al Pastor, or spicy pork. Similar to shawarma, the marinated pork is placed on a vertical spit and freshly sliced into your tortillas as you order your tacos. The meat is moist and packed with flavor! The sauce they put in the tacos compliment it really well. Squeeze a little bit of fresh lime on top and call it a day!  My girlfriend and I also shared a half order of the Adobada Fries. The portion was huge considering it was a half order. We barely made a dent in it. They were just OK, nothing like the tacos. They were lathered in sour cream, shredded cheese, and topped with a heaping amount of guac.  Seating here is very limited, especially on the weekend. If there are a few extra bodies in your party, I suggest that one of you snag a table (or attempt to) while the others wait in the lines to order grub!  Tacos El Gordo is a must and definitely worth the wait! It's now on my list of places to bring my out of town guests!",

Make sure to look at the signs at the start of each line to know what you're getting in line for!  A bit chaotic like the previous location, but still as delicious as it gets nevertheless. Because we ended up waiting for a full hour for all the food, we definitely felt the need to over-order, ultimately getting almost $120 worth of tacos and fries for 7 people. TACO FEAST!

My husband and son are obsessed with the half pastor half asada fries, they stay crispy, the guac is killer, we passed on the sour cream. Why they closed their prime location on the strip is beyond me, but both their other locations are close enough and more than worth seeking out. Both have outstanding service, amazing food and way too long of a wait to get your food. You really have to be lucky to find a seat here, worst case eat it in the car or outside, again more than worth it. Prices are fair, the $10 will fill you up for days, the $2 tacos are tiny, get at least 4. A must stop every time I am in Vegas!",

Lots of people save tables while others in their group wait in the hour line.. so they are actually on the table for like 2 hours.   Other than the crowd and small space, the food is delicious here. Definitely recommend getting something with the adobada. They have campechana fries which is half adobada and half carne asada which is always AMAZING.  - long lines - very little tables + delicious food",

Try the \"vampiro\", it's basically what you get in a taco but with cheese in between to tostadas.  Pastor is one of the best I've tried and I have tried many!  The green salsa is excellent and the tacos de tripa are also a must, order it! I would have gave them 5 stars but seems like you have to check your order when ever your there or they will throw in a few tacos that you didn't order!  Watch out man food is good but if your not careful you will be paying for some extra tacos you didn't enjoy, I'm just saying check your receipt!!!!  Comelones Roll Out!!!",

I've been to Mexico a few times and the food that the locals eat away from touristy areas seemed more gringo-ish than this.   I will say that once you wait in line for 15 minutes and then pay way too much for street tacos, you are treated to spicy pork deliciousness. However, I think $2 each for small tacos and long lines with little seating is too much for me to give Tacos El Gordo 5 stars.   I took a buddy who I thought would like it and he wasn't impressed at all. Same complaints as me. Too long of a line, fighting for a seat, too expensive for what it is. But damn, those spicy pork tacos are good.  Tip-if you are really hungry, order the fries and two tacos=tons of food for $14.",

With that said, i must first retract my title for Los Tacos as the best tacos place in Vegas because has El Gordo has stolen it and tucked it away in a far far place.  3 items that will have you mesmerized forever.....Spicy Pork, Beef Tongue, and Beef Head.  The pork is amazingly juicy packed with flavor and sauces that'll make you go up and order 5 more.  The beef tongue is super tender and soft and melts like butter.  The beef head is naturally delicious with a strong beefy taste to it so beware if you're sensitive to smells.  The meat is extra soft as well.  I usually always get tacos of the 3 but venturing out is definitely worth it.  Tostadas and Mulas are not bad options and if you've been here 2312932 times and always order tacos, these are the ones to try.",

It is open until 2am weekdays and 4am wknds, so after my late night workout i was starving so I decided to check it out.  It is not in the best area of Vegas and there is an armed metro cop on duty to diffuse any potential problems which I could definitely see something shady going down in the surrounding area. I'm sure the cop is a good thing and makes customers feel safer going there.  It was kind of a rough crowd the night that i went but then again it was a Friday night around 11 pm. If i went again which I probably would I would avoid weekend nights. The place was packed which is another good sign as far as quality.   I had no idea what to order so I got a Quesedilla and a few Carne Asada tacos.  They were both very authentic. Some of the best mexican food I can remember having.  Especially the Quesedilla. It was so good i thought about turning around and getting another one (I did a to go order)  I would go back but realistically I do not live to close so it wont be happening anytime soon! I only give it 4 stars due to the location and surrounding area. I have to take a point away due to the fact it is in the hood with an armed Metro officer on duty. Nothing to do with the food. Food is great!",

The pork is sliced off the rotisserie and topped with cilantro, onion, and a creamy cilantro guac sauce, and also pineapple if you'd like. They have carne asada, too, and more rare finds like tongue, head and tripe. All tacos are $2.  The Adobada was good, but not spicy nor tasty enough to order a second.  The Carne Asada earned no stars, the meat had an odd flavor almost musty and the runny guac helped it none.",

Everything is so freaking good...the adobado is like crack, the grilled onions and peppers great additions to the best fresh tortillas we've ever had. If there were more than 5 stars avail we'd give it to you BUT for the decor, smell, and overall chaos inside this kinda-shady location off the strip.  Seriously, TEG, clean up your act a bit (place smells a bit like a latrine, no clear lines for food unless you are \"in the know\" and are prepared to eat whatever is handed to you wherever you end up at the grill, and we're not certain if there was carne asada or dirt on the floor everywhere)...clean it up just a smidge and you would be millionaires by months end by our visits alone.

Although if you have been out on the Strip and are craving some delicious tacos, it is centrally located. Bonus, the prices are the same.  I only come here for one thing, the tacos al pastor. Everything else, except the tacos de asada are good, but for me it's al pastor all the way. I can eat five of them without any problems, they are so good. I have friends from Tijuana that say that these taste exactly the same as El Gordo in TJ. Get some cebollitas and chiles asados to go along with your order. Drizzle a little lime juice over them, and you have yourself a full feel for under 10 bucks. I've read some reviews that say this area is shady at night, hardly. You'll be ok.   Nuff said, for an authentic taste of al pastor tacos, check out El Gordo.",

The wait is too long and you have to make different lines to order different types of meat tacos..Wtf! And people continue to go even though everyone complains about the same thing. At the end their tacos are not that great! I don't care what anyone has to say! Go to Taco Y Taco in Henderson. Now that place has amazing tacos, great service, and the place looks very upscale for the same price!",

First time I came here I had high hopes it was going to be as good as people have said, I was wrong, I've gotten better tasting tacos from food trucks, the meat had too much fat and the guacamole was disgusting, tacos had no flavor whatsoever, I tried really hard to eat them but I just couldn't, I wanted to gag, ended up throwing them away and eating at McDonalds, total waste of money and food, very disappointing! Their competitors next door \"Los Tacos\" are better in my opinion but to each their own!",

I particularly crave about tacos al pastor, and these are amazing, whether you order a plain pastor taco or you try the pastor \"mulita\" (which is a pastor taco in a flower tortilla with a bunch of melted cheese) these tacos are outstanding. Also try the campechana fries, an order of french fries topped with cheese, guacamole, sour cream and a bunch of asada and pastor meet, its heavenly. The place is very good but it sometimes gets very crowded, so chances are in a saturday night you might have trouble finding a table, but its definitely worth it. Also, on weekend nights, you might find a guy outside selling home made donuts, do yourself a favor and try them, they are very good.",

My friend got the carne asada fries which were so good and not to mention we were a group of four guys and could not finish up a half order of these.

During the busy hours they have you separate into three lines depending on the type of meat you want to order. So bring along friends to divide and conquer those lines.  The restaurant is fairly big and spacious in size but not big enough with the amount of crowds that roll through here with roughly 10-15 tables inside/5 tables outside.  Make sure you know what you want to order and be ready to yell out your order to the cooks. It is pretty loud with the amount of people talking over each other and over the loud music.  Again, i waited 1 1/2 hours to order: Carne Asada Fries. Good amount of meat. Meat was juicy and not dry at all. Fries were not soggy at all and that was a PLUS! Overall pretty tasty. Cashiers were friendly and quick.  Totally recommend this joint. (just avoid busy hours)",

    "text": "OMG, the best tacos I've had. Only had the carne asada and adobo and the adobo was my favorite. That's all I'm going to order for next time. One of the cook was super nice, while he was putting out my order it slipped out of my hand and fell behind the cooks counter and he said it was no problem and remade my order. Order concept is a bit unorganized in my opinion, I know it's suppose to speed up the ordering process but not if you're ordering for a large party/family. Some wants this and some wants that and you will have to stand in all three lines, if you're there by yourself ordering to-gos. Might be good to rethink the ordering concept!",

    "text": "When you want real tacos, no matter what part of the U.S. you reside in, this is the shizznit.  Probably my favorite thing about this place is not the fact that they have two locations, one in Tijuana and the other in Las Vegas. The best thing about El Gordo is they offer NO el pollo items. I love it, since chicken tacos are pretty stupid. There is not enough fat and tendon juices that can enhance a chicken taco to umami levels. No chicken, I love it.  The Al pastor is Mexico City style and perfect snack between 4-5 hour gambling sessions at the Wynn and Palazzo. The lengue with a little lime and onion is perfectly braised. The tripe tacos are also perfect and feel really healthy when you have them.  I need this spot once a day when I'm in Vegas regardless of what the encore at Wynn/Venetian/Cosmo/mgm are offering in their buffets. I end up winning after eating this Al pastor.",

    "text": "This is the taco place that got me to fall in love with Mexican food! Well, the original location that was on the Strip was the one, but this location didn't falter to please.  My sister and I had gotten a craving to come here since we hadn't been for awhile, and we were jealous that the little brother got to go without us... Sister Date! Anyway... The ordering is pretty much the same, you pick a line with the meat you want, then tell them how you want it. My sister got to try Lengua (beef tongue) tacos, and we also ordered Adobada (pork) fries. The all the toppings still taste as fresh as can be. Both orders were fully loaded. Hahaha... Eating here can get messy, so ask for extra napkins. My sister was also surprised that she enjoyed the lengua: \"Taste more like regular beef than anything different, and texture isn't bad.\" Took awhile for the fries, but it came out fresh so there aren't any gripes there, plus they still loaded it with the pork.  Oh man... We over-ordered though 'cause we forgot how big of the fries was, which was 1 entire to-go container. I helped her with about 3/4 of that thing, and we were supposed to half it! Shouldn't have ordered the tacos as well, but man... It was worth it! Our cravings are more than satisfied!  Customer service is still good. Nice guys when you order up at the counter, and the ladies are always friendly when you pay. This location was pretty clean and not as busy as the closed Strip location, but we did go around 2PM. The seating area was good too, taking up more room than the original location. I don't recall any outdoor seating though. Only thing I wish they had was Jarritos soda.",

While visiting Las Vegas, I came here two nights in a row for dinner and both times we've waited in line for these tacos. People order in large amounts, 15-20 tacos at a time, pretty smart I say. These tacos are so delicious, you won't settle with just 3 like you would a regular taco truck. These tacos make you come back for more -kind-of-tacos.",

    "text": "So this mythical taco place is a word of mouth recommendation that I decided to visit on my last trip to Vegas. It's drive past the strip into a run down area of Vegas but it's worth to try this authentic spot.  The place is a transplant from Tijuana and they do it just like they do in Mexico. The place was packed when we arrived! You squeeze in and get in line by what kind of meat you want: asada, pollo, al pastor, lengua, sesos, etc. Then when you get to the front you let the cook know whether you want tacos, sopas, carne fries, quesadilla, etc. He prepares your meal on the spot using fresh ingredients including hand made tortillas and gives you your completed order so you can pay at the register. The meat is well cooked and the tortillas are bomb!  Plus, through all the lines of people and sweltering temperatures behind the grill, everyone who works here does it with a smile. Great customer service! This is going to be a tradition when I go to Vegas now.",

I may not be from Mexico, but as for taquieria food in Las Vegas, none comes close to this place.

It was very busy at lunchtime, and we were certainly bumbling around trying to figure out what to order.  But we finally settled on the Tacos de Adobada.   They are rather small, so we each got 3.  I could have easily seen eating more if you were hungry, but we felt pretty satisfied.  They have a huge rack of Pork complete with Pineapple dripping down onto it, and it is hand cut as well as the Tortillas are being hand made right before your eyes!  I'm knocking off 1 star because for some reason we ended up with canned Diet Soda even though they have fountain Coke. Not sure why they did this to me, but I didn't notice it until it was too late.  Don't get duped.  Otherwise, seriously this place is fantastic!",

Plus, what really put this place over the top was they had Orange Bang and all the other Bang products on tap! On tap! Needless to say, I started to OD on the frothy orange goodness of it.

Fortunately I had read some reviews and was able to navigate the line system, but I can see it being confusing for the uninitiated. Ordered a mix of carne adovada, carne asada & suadero tacos.  Adovada was by far the most enjoyable.  Suadero was tender and smoky.  Carne asada was passable, but not my favorite in town.  The corn tortillas were pulled fresh off the grill, and the various sauces that accompanied the tacos were flavorful.  Everything here was good, but outside of the carne adovada I wouldn't classify anything as great.  Maybe my expectations were too high, as the tacos had been described as a \"life-changing experience.\" Who knows... Service was definitely friendly and the lines move relatively quickly.  Bottomless horchata is a plus.  All-in-all, a pleasant experience.",

The cooks work very hard and prepare your food right in front of you which is a huge plus, so tip them if you can afford it. The problem is the area, it's extremely hot, it feels like you're on the surface of planet mercury and the air conditioning in the joint is inadequate.

    "text": "Past Weekend went to this place, normally I go at least twice a month. I ordered the same 1 Vampiro and 3 Tostadas ASADA all the time. So anyways, they have a business going on here, The Taquero makes the tacos and tostadas and on top of one of your tostadas he is going to place TWO tostadas so when you get to the cashier she is going to count super fast and she is going to count TWO TOSTADAS instead of just one. So after they charged me, I went to have a talk with the cashier, she got offended and she told me the taquero was just giving me as a courtesy an extra tostada, (which I don't need cause tostadas come with TWO TOSTADAS each normally). So the taquero perfectly placed two tostadas on top of one, when o went to pay, she CHARGED DOUBLE \"by mistake\" obviously, and at the end of the day WHO DO YOU THINK is going to have a lot of extra CASH?. This is something very common in Mexico with Taqueros and cashiers, they still from customers to be able to make enough money.  I don't think the owners know what the workers are doing here, cause if they did, they would of known they are killing their business. I'm not going back to this location ever again. And I hope everyone CHECKS BEFORE THEY PAY!!! And for the workers who are stilling money, just one thing.  \"KARMA will follow you\"   El fin de semana pasado fui a este establecimiento como siempre voy, siempre pido lo mismo, 1 vampiro y 3 tostadas de asada, en esta taqueria los trabajadores ya tienen su forma de operar, el taquero pondra perfectamente colocadas dos tostadas donde solo debe haber UNA, cuando llegas a la caja, la cajera contara rapido todas las tapas de las tostadas, OBVIO contara doble una de ellas y te la cobrara tal cual. Al darme cuenta de lo que hacen fui a decirle a la cajera que le regalaba mi dinero, que no me estaba robando, que yo se lo regalaba, me dijo que el taquero habia colocado perfectamente la tostada extra como cortesia, (una tostada extra que NO necesito porque las tostadas ya vienen con una de cortesia) pero bueno el caso es que se molesto porque evidencie frente a todos el negocio que hacen robandole a los clientes, solo espero que los duenos se enteren!!!, Por lo pronto la cajera y el taquero ya ganaron un KARMA y el dueno ya perdio dos clientes, mas a todos los amigos que yo les pueda contar de esto!!!!  PD. Los tacos estan buenos pero no tan Buenos para volver y dejar que me roben!!!!! Hay mas opciones......arreglen este problema",

We pulled out the trusty Yelp app and started looking for places to grab a bite and get back to the drive.  Tacos El Gordo pops up and we say, \"sure let's give it a try.\"   Tacos for $2?!  Adobada that changed my life and expectations of what a pork taco should taste like.  Initially we were a little shy when getting our food and did not want to over buy, only to go back up to the counter 2 more times for 2nds and 3rds.    The best part the experience was my children, 10 and younger loved the lengua taco.  At first we just purchased the taco, asked them to try it, and only after they ate the whole thing did we discuss what it was.  My 10 year old goes back up to the counter by himself to order another 3 or 4 for the table.    Since that glorious dining experience, I must have told 100+ people to visit Tacos El Gordo in either Vegas or Chula Vista/San Diego.    What did I learn today?  Dining here at 1am is a real experience.",

    "text": "For anyone that follows my reviews or knows me I am a taco lover. If there is a good taco I'm there for it. I've been to Tacos El Gordo once before and didn't get the Al Pastor. Shame on me, I know. Every time I bring up that Los Tacos (across the street) is underrated and might be better all my friends say, \"NO WAY! TACOS EL GORDO IS WAY BETTER!\" So today I took my wife on a taco tasting to eat at both places. Below are my thoughts on Tacos El Gordo, check my Los Tacos review too!  I came here for one thing only. Al Pastor tacos. But I would also suggest getting Mullas if you haven't had them before. Delicious.   But the Al Pastor is perfect. Spicy pork with crispy bits and very juicy. The avocado cream and salsa all compliment the meat perfectly. They're delicious no doubt about it. Little bites of pineapple to just add that pop of tart citrus. Just a really excellent taco.  But nothing else here stands out as MUST HAVE. It's a one trick pony. And they have that stupid ordering system where you gotta wait in line get your food, wait in line pay, and by the time you sit down the Taco is soggy. So inefficient it kills me.  Based on the Al Pastor alone place is a winner. But rest of the menu and the ordering set up brings it down a peg for me.",

    "text": "Okay, so.  After months of hearing this place hyped up as the BEST taco spot in Las Vegas, I can confirm...  Not really worth the hype.    Now mind you, they're not BAD tacos.  I got a few of the carne asada, al pastor & carne asada mulas.  All of the meat was seasoned well, but it wasn't anything to write home about.    The carne asada was a bit dry, the guacamole had zero flavor and the al pastor was a bit on the overly sweet side (for me).    I'm a minimalist when it comes to street tacos.  My personal recommendation would be to order the tacos without everything on them.  All of the toppings really throw off the meat to everything-else ratio.    They also run a bit pricey and the method of order to payment is strange and highly inefficient.     Might be back if I'm in the area but wouldn't go out of my way to get them.",

Something to note about this place is you have to grab a red tray and order the type of taco you want and most of the time they will give you a plate with 1 taco or sometimes 2 if you get more. So, the red tray is nice to carry your taco plates.  Also, there is a lady taking payments on the opposite side of the taco ordering. You can also get napkins and salsa there along with drinks. Ladies were very helpful. And the taste oh the taste!!!!!!",

The cooks were working their butts off making everything fresh to order. But the volume was just too much. Then you have to stand in another, smaller line to pay. The whole to go ordeal took about 45 minutes  The carne asada fries were awesome. Really soft though, which I don't mind but other people might. I suppose you could ask to get them double fried. They are also a little stingy with the portions. My full order almost looked more like a half order.",

I was in somewhat of a tie between the other two, but overall both were so good! I love that the toppings come on the tacos and there's plenty of fresh limes available.   You can't beat the prices either, only $2-3 per taco. I'm almost glad this isn't closer to me since I'd probably gain about ten pounds over a two week span.  If you haven't been here yet, go! You will not regret it!",

They have a huge selection of different meats. Tripas happens to be my favorite. The nopales are delicious with salsa and guacamole on them. Must try this place if you in Vegas. They-have a few locations the one by  freemont street isn't as crowded as the one on the strip.  They also have a few location in the San Diego area. Go eat tacos!!",

    "text": "Our favorite taco place in Vegas! Friends tried the one by The Strip but they said it's not the same so we always go to this location.  We've been pretty lucky and haven't had to wait long (max 10 min). But we're usually here past 1AM.  They have their own parking area but since they are in a plaza, there's also plenty of parking nearby as well. They do have a few tables outside towards the back if all the tables inside are taken. Usually pretty cold inside as well, so bring a jacket at night!  When you enter, you pick up a tray if you are ordering a bunch of different items and then stand in line one of 3 lines for the type of meat you want. If you want a different meat in another line,  then you'll have to go to that other line as well (or have a friend grab it for you). When you got all your items, you pay at the cashier. By the drinks is where you can find the limes & radishes.  My favorite is the lengua (beef tongue) and cabeza (beef head) tacos. WARNING: If you order the cabeza tacos, they do have a spicy sauce that goes with it so if you don't do spicy foods well, be sure not to get it. I like to wash everything down with a horchata. My friends always order the al pastor and carne asada. Meats are tender and always delicious.  Afterwards, don't forget to take away your trash so other people can use the table right away. This place is ALWAYS busy!  NEVER a Vegas trip without a stop here!",

I was offered a plate of green onions and roasted jalapeno on the side.  Every one of the tacos was flavorful. I recommend getting the with everything on them.  Each of the different meats was served slightly differently with the toppings to keep them authentic.    I was not brave enough to try the lengua or cabaesa.

All the corn tortillas are hand made and are delicious.   Just a word of advice, different stations let you order tacos with different meats but the adobada is definitely one of the best on the menu. The adobada is on a spit that rotates so that the outside part that gets cut up has a nice char to it. Then it's topped with onions, cilantro, on top of a couple corn tortillas! Order your food, get your food, then go to the cashier and pay.   This is definitely one of the places I go to at least once every time I go to Vegas!",

    "text": "What's a trip to the West Coast without some authentic Mexican tacos? No where in New York {to my knowledge} has tacos as authentic as the ones I've had in California, notably El Chato Taco Truck and El Taurino in Los Angeles.  So naturally, during our week in Vegas, we needed to hunt down the best tacos. With glowing recommendations from friends, we trekked to Tacos El Gordo. Ordering was intimidating at first with Spanish flying across the room. Each meat was sectioned off, so if you wanted to order Carne Asada tacos, you'd have to go to a specific section, and so on. I wanted to try them all, so I went from right to left, with my al pastor {pork} taco first, a lengua {beef tongue} taco, and then finally my two carne asada {steak} tacos accompanied by my small {but still relatively large} helping of carne asada fries.  Tacos El Gordo was well worth the hype surrounding it. There was always a generous amount of meat in each taco, which was balanced out with the onions, cilantro, salsas, and of course, a warm tortilla. I wish I took some more pictures, but I was too excited about my carne asada fries, eep! Lastly, I got a guava juice pop, the perfect ending to my meal and perfect for combating the dry Vegas heat.  As one of my last meals in Sin City, Tacos El Gordo was the cherry on top of my perfect vacation. I'll be back for more al pastor tacos.",

The abadoba fries cannot be beat (I did not eat any, but the person I bought them for ate literally non stop and with a vengeance).   Some people don't like the $2.00 per taco price, but most places are around $1.79 - $1.89 and don't come close. So  less than a quarter more per taco for 10 X's the flavor is still a good deal to me.   The only drawback is the process. You get to the window, belt out your order, hang back and wait. You need to keep an eagle eye on your food otherwise it might unintentionally walk off. After that you wander over to the cashier and pay. Don't get me wrong, it works, just a bit unorganized is all.   With that said, the staff is great and the place is very clean.   Also, I would (as mentioned in my other reviews) hit the tip jar when you place your order. It not only helps the staff out but almost always insures an exceptional meal.",

Absolutely! They are by far better than robertos and they offer a more authentic Mexican taste! I think it's quite fascinating how they have this adobada spinning around on this wheel now personally I don't care for watching the meet spinning around like that with the guy shaving the meat sections off with this huge hunting knife lol but it's nothing a little prayer before the meal wing solve!

The tacos are all pretty much$ 2.00 a piece and there small and have that crazy guacamole like in Tijuana. They also will offer you grilled onions, grilled jalapenos and have a salsa bar off to the side at no charge. Cool. Plus they have free refills. But like I said, it's the same taco they sell in Tijuana so why change it right? The neighborhood it's in is kinda shady . FYI..... that's the star that's missing on my review.

I wish they would give u some chips but it's whatever's. Oh ya the salsa on the tacos is so bomb. Overall straight 5 stars, wish I could've gave it More.",

Pastor could have been cooked a little longer for some crisp.  My husband gets his cooked well done bcz it's to raw for his liking. Now that's the way to go & it's super yummy.",

    "text": "After hearing Vince L saying that after eating the tacos from Tacos El Gordo, tacos elsewhere is no longer the same, my bf and I made a visit for lunch on a Friday afternoon.   When we arrived, there were so many people there and we were a bit confused with the ordering.  The tiny paper that were taped to the bucket at each station was a bit hard to see at the chaotic time.  I went to a line to order the cabeza taco and the person behind the counter directed me to a different line, then I was like OMG, I totally didn't see that each line is for different items.  Then after we received our 3 cabeza, 2 lengua, and 2 tripa tacos, we head over to a different counter to order drinks and to pay.  I asked if the horchata was freshly made and she said yes...THAT is not True because it came out of the fountain and it doesn't taste homemade.  I then opted for the orange bang.  Right around where the drink fountain is where we found limes, turnips and other condiments.  The food was really authentic and yummy.  I will definitely come back to try other items on the menu.",

I had no idea what to expect, but it sounded interesting.  It turned out to be exactly what it sounded like.... french fries covered in grated cheese, guacamole and carne asada.  They were good but not really what I was looking for in terms of spice.  The second time we got the spicy pork tacos.  The pineapple on top was a nice touch.  They had great flavor and spice.  My husband got flour tortillas and I got corn.  We also learned to ask for peppers and onions on the side, which were free.  The people were friendly and helpful.",

The adobado, also known as \"spicy pork\" & carne asada tacos on corn tortillas were magical. Granted, we are from Florida and aren't provided True mexican food very often -- but this place was on a whole different level of amazing. My husband and I were smiling during our whole visit to Tacos El Gordo because the food and service were impeccable. I'm glad we ventured away from \"The Strip\" for cheaper food. We got stuffed for $17.00 and it was one of our favorite parts of our trip to Vegas. Thanks so much for the amazing food. We will be back! We already miss the food. It truly is a shame that Florida doesn't have food this delicious.",

    "text": "There's a rumor that you can ONLY get legit Mexican food closer to San Diego or ONLY in Mexico. Tacos El Gordo puts this rumor six feet under with it's authentic Mexican flavor and great customer appreciation! Advertised as coming straight from Tijuana, it's no wonder that Tacos El Gordo or \"The Fat Taco\" in English, is a taco above the rest!  Upon walking in, the amorous fragrance of the spices grab your nose and the various meats cooking make your mouth water like an infant drooling! Yes, it's just like that! My favorite spectacle of the restaurant is the BBQ spit that holds the fresh al pastor meat (marinated spicy pork)! I suggest the al pastor mula with everything (cilantro, onions, salsa, and avocado salsa) and suadero (marinated beef) tacos with everything! Make sure you don't forget the FREE grilled peppers and green onions at the end of the ordering line :)  Grab your limes, pay, and ask the cashier if you'd like some salsa. If you choose to get a fountain drink, I suggest getting a cup full of some refreshing orange bang (whipped orange drink that tastes like an orange creamsicle) and brace yourself for some filling, satisfying, flavor packed, and the most authentic Mexican grub this side of the border! Writing this review triggered my craving so I'm actually on my way to fulfill myself!  WARNING: This reviewer and his reviews are not responsible for addictions to great food! You've been warned!  You're welcome :)",

    "text": "Did not have a mind blowing experience this time around.  I was really excited to introduce this place to the husband so we came for lunch. We ordered 6 tacos adobadas con pinas. Apparently some guy ordered a mula  (the workers call it \"mulita\" though)  but ended up not wanting it, so we got coaxed into ordering this mula because they offered us extra meat (ugh, I'm so easy sometimes).   We bit into the tacos and the meat was flat. There was no tantalizing of the tastebuds. I was embarassed about my ravings. It was definitely their \"off\" day. Then we bit into the mulita and it was so salty! The saltiness was exacerbated by the cheese and the red sauce. It was simply messy dish and I would not order it again (even if they gave me extra meat, haha!) I noticed that a lot of other patrons had ordered mulitas and they were enjoying it. I think ours turned out to be bad because it was probably sitting out for more than 10 minutes. Ugh, why am I so easy sometimes!  Anyway, I'm going to give El Gordo one more shot and hopefully this time around it'd be as excellent as my first experience.  FYI: \"Mulita\" is used to describe these types of sandwiched tacos in the Northern States of Mexico, while they are known as Gringa in the Mexican south and are prepared using wheat flour tortillas.

If you land there within that time frame, be sure to call them and ask beforehand! Please and thanks =).  WHY: Tacos, tacos, and more TACOS!  WHAT: While at work, my co-workers and I were talking about how hungry we were! One of my co's mentioned that she went with another co to a Mexican spot the other night, and also mentioned how delicious it was! I automatically hopped on that conversation and asked what this wonderful place could be!  Then and there, I felt like I was deprived of life because I haven't really tried a real Mexican spot besides Roberto's Tacos (don't get me wrong, I love late night cravings and journeys to Roberto's, but I have found another spot to satisfy these random cravings). So, after all this talking, we decided to take ACTION and eat there after our shifts!  This was a really different environment!! When I walked in with my co's, it was packed! There is an Order station where you order the types of taco's you would like. Tacos are 2 bucks each- totally worth it!  I tried: Cabeza taco (beef head): First timer, but it was way good! Adobada taco (marinated pork): I have never had adobada anything, and I have come to find that adobada should be in EVERYTHING! lol. Asada taco (steak): I love carne asada, so this is a no-brainer! DELICIOUS! Adobada fries: I ordered a box to take to-go for my family! I had to take a bite out of it too, and it made me fall in love with Mexican food!  I'd love to try other things! This taco shop is way FLAVORFUL, FUN, AND OPEN UNTIL 4AM! Ch ch check it out!",

In terms of ambiance this place is definitely lacking -- there are no pinatas, mariachi bands, or oversized margarita glasses in sight.  But as soon as you step up to the order counter you will be treated to a feast for the eyes.  A giant slab of sizzling pork on a rotating skewer with a giant pineapple on top, it's juices slowly basting the meat to delicious perfection.  Excuse me, I just drooled on my keyboard.    Back to my description -- after I placed an order for spicy pork tacos my order taker carefully sliced a few slabs of pork onto warm handmade corn tortillas topped off with fresh pico de gallo, crema fresca and a thin slice of grilled pineapple.  It was truly the best taco I ever tasted and for only $2 I had lots of extra money to drop at the slot machines!",

    "text": "I had no idea Tacos El Gordo was also in Vegas! I went to San Diego for college and discovered Tacos El Gordo there. So, when I found out there's two locations in Vegas too, I was pretty stoked.  I've been to this location and to the one right on the strip. I went to this one recently because one of the cab drivers we had that day said this location was way better. Anyhow, it's all about them adobada tacos! I always eat 3 of these when I go. Gets me pretty full, too! And this time, my friends and I shared the carne asada fries. I thought they were good, too. The fries were crispy and not soggy, so that was a plus for me! If you want some pretty bomb tacos that you'll ever have in your life, you have to hit up Tacos El Gordo (in Vegas OR San Diego!).",

    "text": "Came with Yelpers as the 3rd taco stop in our crawl.   So there are lines going for different things. You go to one line, and then sort've slide down from one to another if you want different things. There is a adobada line (the one with the spit), the middle is kinda all the rest, then the grilled onions and peppers station (gratis with tacos so get some), and then left most is carne asada. It may take a moment if you're getting a few things, or if there is at least a few of you - split up. Since it's the last stop we ordered a few things to get full up. Then you go to the register to pay, get drinks,  and get red and/or green sauce. There is a serve yourself bar from limes and radishes.   Adobada was good, juicy and a bit crisp on the edges which I like. We didn't get with pineapple but this one was a rather sweet adobada than most I've had, like they keep basting with pineapple juice on the outside. Not good or bad thing, just depends what you're into but I thought it was a solid, if a bit different adobada. Lengua was tender, but was a bit more fatty than average so the BF wasn't fond of it, but it was alright for me. It's like not enough of the connective stuff rendered off so there is a fattiness to it that can be a put off. The cabeza here was pretty decent and we both liked that.  I love they give you grilled onions and peppers. I moved here from San Diego and this was a normal TJ style thing to eat with tacos and I haven't had it since I've moved here. Definitely was a plus for me.   Now, with a place that is so talked up I expect a lot and while it was good, it wasn't my favorite. And being not a grand slam means it isn't worth the trouble of lining up and then sliding down each of the stations then hoping there is a table open in the constantly busy restaurant (there are a few outside to one side if its full inside). I just get salty at chaos when it comes to trying to eat.  The one time I tried to stumble to the strip location we were a bit overwhelmed and confused (since I didn't know the deal with this place and the lines) so we left. Since it was our last stop too, comparatively the tacos were smaller than our other stops at the same price and the most hassle to get so this would be a plan C for me type place. I almost never want to make it difficult to get food unless it's phenomenal and even then I have my limits. I am not jumping the gordo bandwagon.  (Yelp 100 Challenge 44/100)",

Delicious tacos. Prices range from $2.15 - $2.45.   They have all kinds of red meat... Asada, pastor, the spicy pork ones, beef head, lengua, and even sesos! Wow! They have more meat, but I don't remember their names at the moment.   They do not have chicken. Keep that in mind.   Their ordering process is a bit unusual though. There's three different lines to order from. Depending on the type of meat you want, you go to that particular line that is serving that meat. Ex: you want asada, line #1. Pastor, line #2, Sesos, line #3, etc. Then you go to the cashier on the other side of the restaurant with your food tray to pay. I'm just use to paying for  my food when I order it or when I get my food, in the same spot.  Oh, and clean establishment. There are always staff walking around cleaning up the tables and wiping down the tables for the next party to sit down.",

What did drop, was the cleanliness of the restaurant, when compared to their LV blvd location.  It wasn't bad, but it seems like they go the extra mile to tidy up at the spot I frequent often.  My lengua taco was not chopped up quite as much as it usually is at their other location.  I know, something very petty to complain about, but the taste also wasn't quite as fresh.  Or maybe it was just in my head..who knows.  Either way, I didn't feel the 5 star experience that I get at the strip loc.

We had the intentions of trying different tacos but decided to just go with carne asada since we would have to stand at different lines for about 30 minutes.  It took us 30 minutes before it was our turn to order. I would say the tacos are not worth the wait. They are decent but I have had better. The tacos come with guacamole (which doesn't taste like anything) a red salsa, cilantro and onions. I was expecting more flavor based on the reviews. The tacos would probably taste a lot better if they seasoned the meat and guacamole and if they made a salsa that is spicy.   We did enjoy the free grilled onions and jalapenos. Which is a plus!  Based on the wait and taste we probably will not be back. If there wasn't a long wait we would probably stop by again, but they are definitely not worth the wait.",

The food is yummy as always. Get the adobada! The lines are long and can get confusing since they tend to curve around the tables in the middle. Remember, each line is meant for a specific meat! It's not very cool in there so it kind of sucks when it's hot as balls outside, but it's okay. I'd do it for the food. Eat and bounce!   While I was in line, a child spilled a drink on the floor near me. While I was standing waiting for my order of fries, the lady who was cleaning the floor pushed me out of her way! I understand that you're trying to wipe up the drink but she could've tapped me and asked me to move nicely. What if I had stepped onto some liquid after she pushed me and slipped?   TL;DR eat here if you're craving some bomb freaking tacos. Remember, adobada!",

Simple, delicious, no-frills menu. You can't get better than this.   Since my last review I've been here numerous times and I always order the same thing: CABEZA, ADOBADA, and LENGUA. If you have not tried these yet, please, step away from your carne asada and discover the sheer pleasure of these juicy, flavorful meats. Out of this world delicious!!!",

It's chaotic in there.  You don't know where on line starts and the other begins.  You want asada tacos you have to stand in one line for over an hour and if you want al pastor you have to get in another line for another hour.  So you literally have to eat your asada tacos in line, while waiting in line to get al pastor tacos.  You can do better Tacos El Gordo.  Get organized.",

    "text": "4.5 stars. I can't quite give it five stars, but Tacos El Gordo is very good.  Several people had recommended Tacos El Gordo to me, and I was excited to finally check it out. There are a number of tables indoors as well as a small outdoor seating area with heat lamps. The restaurant is also very heavily lit with bright white lights, so you will have no difficult finding it even at night.  As other reviewers have mentioned, there are separate lines for different items, and then a line just for paying at the register. Don't know that this is the most efficient system, but it's what they use. I ended up getting food from two separate lines. No waiter service. Food is made fresh so it can be a little bit of a wait. I forgot to ask for some pineapple garnish, but did get some grilled green onions and peppers (free, but you have to ask for them).   Most tacos range from $2-4 a piece, and there are a few non-taco items on the the menu as well. I ordered a sope de lengua, plus three tacos (cabeza, buche, and tripa). I'm pretty sure my tripa got mixed up with something else, because it didn't taste like tripe. The cabeza was also a bit gamey, more than I expected. However, the tacos overall were very good. Don't forget to get some radishes and lime at the side bar!  By the way, they also have drink cups and desserts at the register. Once you buy the cup, you can self-serve your beverage at the soda fountain next to the garnish bar.   Probably one of the better taco places in Las Vegas, though I haven't had many tacos here yet. Tacos El Gordo also has a location on the Strip.",

Carne asada was tender and out of this world.  Our group got a variety of stuff so I'll highlight the main ones. First off there are two lines. Just look st the sign and get to the line that corresponds to it. There's a pay area once you get everything you want to the right side. One tip though... the carne asada fries, a small being about 7.25 and the regular is 13$. It takes about five to ten minutes to come so order that first and get to the second line for some al pastor tacos! Tacos are about 2-2.50$ a piece and I'd recommend about 3-4 because they are quite small. Tostadas are just basically crispy tacos and I personally enjoy those better than the soft tortilla. Quesadilla have soft tortilla on bottom and a crispy shell on top. It looks weird but eat it all together and it's bomb!!",

The setting to order is unique and you are able to get other items besides tacos too. Fresh and fast service is great and the lines could be shorter and more organized.

This location is off the strip and it was well worth the $80 round trip uber LOL. My cousins and I didn't want to go to the one on the strip because we knew it would have been terribly crowded during the weekend. Tip - come with a big group so you can line up in different lines!  As you can see from the photo below, we ordered enough for a village. I clearly eat with my eyes too....and ordered more tacos than I could eat. I tried lengua tacos for the first time, but it's definitely not as flavorful as al pastor and asada. We also tried the al pastor fries *drrooool  Can't wait to be back!",

Make sure when you get to the front of the line order double of the tacos, or you'll regret not getting more. Get the green sauce!",

To begin with I order 6 asada tacos which were good ,but needed a little bit more flavor and I also loved how everything is freshly made even the tortillas. FYI the tortilla are normal size. In addition the price is per taco I think it was 2$ and cents. Furthermore I do recommend coming to this place it wasn't that bad.",

There is 3 lines one is for asada and chorizo tacos, sopes, fries or quesadillas.  The other is for Adobo, tripas, lengua (tongue), sesos (brain). The 3rd line is to pay and order your drinks.  The line moves pretty fast.  Handmade tortillas.  Toppings are guacamole, and salsa. They're also grilling green onions and jalapenos while cooking the hand made tortillas.  So delicious! Well worth the wait.      This location is off the strip and has a lot of tables and chairs to sit down at.  The employees are very helpful and are ready to clean the tables for you as soon as a customer is finished.",

The system they have to get tacos it's not the easier one though. If you go in a group just get someone to Stand in each line and order all tacos for the group from that kind of meat, and then you can figure out which ones are yours when you pay. You have to ask for grilled onions when you order the tacos, so don't forget that if you like it.   If you feel like you want more salsa feel free to ask the person at the cashier!   I also prefer this location because it's not as busy as others.",

According to the other two in my party, the tacos were made fresh and right in front of you. My friend got 6 asada tacos and they smelled & looked delicious. My bf purchased the adobada fries and I ate some of the fries before he mixed it all together and it was pretty tasty! The best part were the popsicles that they offer here. Limon and cookies and cream are the best flavors. Just wish they served frijoles at least - it would make a lot of vegetarians really happy!!!

It's like eating a tortilla with sauce and a sprinkling of meat. Noticed this mainly on their most popular al pastor tacos.   Usually staff is very polite but lately it's like they don't care you're even there. Cashiers talking to each other while you stand there waiting to pay. No hello, thank you or goodbye. And it wasn't even busy.   Definitely losing its touch. It seems more of a tourist trap now than anything else. Time to look for a better taco spot.",

It was getting pretty busy at the place, and the cashier (mexican lady that had braids) is handling two other people. Now, she sees me and asks me if that fries is all you're going to take. I say yes, and she throws the plastic bag without even asking if I wanted to take it to-go or dine in. I'm like... what the heck? and she says this is yours like I'm suppose to bag my own food, do your job that she should be doing, and giving me the feeling of get the hell out now? Now, to make matters worse, she was nicely bagging the other two people (fyi, they were both mexicans) food while giving them the best smile and says \"SORRY\" to them after dealing with me. I bag my food and waited to get some red sauce, but this cashier looks at me and goes like \"what else do you need?\"...   I love this place, and I would come here a lot with my girl, but boy... today was the first time I've gotten such discrimination just because I wasn't a mexican. I seriously hope that the owner is reading this and do something about her. In addition, don't think that she was just busy and just happened to treat me that way. The cooks were busy, but the cashier was literally chilling and taking their time (which means... she was not busy at all).",

I really like the idea of ordering from the cooks, which is how this place operates. On April 5th, at around 9:30PM, I ordered 3 Carne Asada and 3 Adoboda tacos. The order also came with grilled green onions and yellow chillies on the side. Their green chili sauce is SO good too.   The tacos were fantastic. OK in size at first glance, but after eating a couple, they pack a good punch. Still no match for my appetite on this day. I never tried Adoboda before and it looked so good roasting in front of me, so that was easy to order. The Asada was also looking good just off the grill. Both tacos were really good, however, I did enjoy the Adoboda more than the Asada. Also, the side onions and chillies are mandatory (for me) after tasting them with my meal.   Overall, I can't wait to back to this place again. I'm definitely going to get more Adoboda tacos and try what else they have to offer.",

    "text": "This place didn't get 5 stars because of the salsas...they're not hot enough or tasty enough for me, the best one of is the green salsa, spicier and a little more flavorful than the red.             Some of the best tacos I've had in a long time.  I had the cabeza, carne asada tacos, and a half cabeza/half carne asada order of $10 fries! Yes, their fries as $10!!       I thought that the cabeza tacos were better, the meat very soft and a little slimy? typical of this type of meat, seasoned to perfection.  I don't konw if it was my particular batch of carne asada, but it was way too salty.  The tortillas are made of yellow corn, and are delicious.  They add avocado to their carne asada tacos, but not to the cabeza, apparently this is \"tijuana style\".  You also get a side of grilled onions and yellow peppers, they are delicious with the tacos.  Their order of fries are quite large and they are generous with the meat, however I didn't think they were worth the $10. They add avocado, cheese and cream to the fries, I uploaded a photo of these.      Their customer service is great, they are all very nice, the cooks and the cashiers.  They knew that it was my first time there, and they were very helpful in helping me decide what to order.        I was pleased to see that about 20 min into my delicious meal, the place started getting packed, which is a good indicator of freshness and quality.  You get your order pretty fast.  I would definately recommend this place.         The place looks very clean.",

They do also offer free grilled onions and chiles if you request them.   Don't forget to pick up some candy or ice cream for dessert! arroz con leche or cafe popsicle is my personal favorite",

I was surprised that even though this spot is off the Strip, tourists were still jam packing it to get their infamous adobada AKA al pastor tacos. I of course had to get at least 3 of those bad boys along with a half order of the carne asada fries. I definitely recommend getting the half size because the full order will feed a small army. In addition, they carry the Orange Bhang drink, which I can only ever find in So Cal and now in Vegas. Though you'll  have to fend for a table if you dine in, once you indulge in some Tacos El Gordo, it'll all be worth it in the end my friend.",

The asada tacos are also wonderful, but I prefer the al pastor.  Girlfriend got the steak fries, personally I didn't think there was anything special about them, but she loved it. Go for the smaller size, it's more than enough!",

    "text": "While driving a cab in Vegas I'm always on the lookout for something tasty.  Not only for myself but something I think other people would enjoy as well.  Tacos El Gordo is the newest in that category.  The tacos here are really good.  While not everyone may be up for a lingua (tongue) taco, the el pastor tacos are really really good and so are the carne asada tacos.  Just the other week, I actually brought someone here in the cab who was visiting from Minnesota. He was originally from Mexico City and hadn't had a good taco that he didn't have to make himself for quite some time.  I brought him here to Tacos El Gordo and he was absolutely amazed.  He said the tacos here were the best hes had since he was back visiting family in Mexico.  Personally, I've only had tacos like this on a shopping expedition of sorts in Tijuana but I'd have to agree that these tacos are pretty awesome.  While the price of the tacos is a bit high (even more so when compared to the price in Mexico ;-) ) they're really tasty and you'll definitely come back for more.  A Taco runs about $2.00.  Small price to pay for a piece of happiness.  Bring your appetite and leave happy.  They're open late and are very quick.  The service is friendly and while there seems to be no rhyme or reason to the way their counter is set up, walk right up and get yourself some tacos!",

It's not like a regular pastor taco, cut a little thicker.  The meat is so tender and juicy and flavorful.  I couldn't get enough of that pork.  The carne asada was average at best but the puerco more than makes up for the beef's mediocrity.    They give you a creamy green sauce (avocado cream?  cilantro cream?)  and a righteous red sauce.  I can't imagine a better taco (til i open mine very own taqueria.  stay tuned for that).  Great, fresh, delicate corn tortillas, meat, onion. cilantro, self-admistered sauces.  Great tacos.  Thank you, el gordo.  I love you...",

The carne asada is the worse meat I've ever had, dry like beef jerky and zero flavor. The salsas blow too, no heat or flavor and you can't even self serve the chili, oh did I mention you have to wait in separate lines to order depending on what meat you want ? Save your money.",

    "text": "I learned two things. 1) do not go alone unless you only want one kind of taco. and 2)  \"Adobada\" and \"Al pastor\" are the same thing (at least as far as Tacos El Gordo is concerned)... Oh wait!! 3 things!! That these tacos are crazy good!!!! It was a madhouse inside, 4 different lines to get particular tacos, though, we were in the adobada/al pastor line and were able to order a carne asada taco from it. The guy yelled out to another guy, and after waiting a little longer, we got the carne asada tacos without having to wait in another line. (I'm not sure you can do this from all lines, this was my first experience.) We just had the two types of tacos. The carne asada was spicier than the al pastor. I somehow thought it would be the other way around. So, first you wait in line, then you pay at the cashier desk off to the side, and then try to maneuver your way to the soda fountain on the other side. They have all the Ole brand drinks (plus coke, sprite and orange fanta? I think?) I couldn't tell you what they are, I just know horchata is an option, and that's all I care about. I was at the Charleston location, and I noticed they also have a shuttle to offer shuttle service to the restaurant. Yes, it's that good. I get stressed out in crowds, so this was a pretty stressful experience especially for my first time, but so worth it. I've never even been that much of a street taco person. I now know it's because I've never had good ones. Looking forward to refilling my anxiety meds to eat these again. :D",

There is a cafeteria style ordering system.  Adobada, carne asada, something that looked like beef parts.  The cooks were slapping the tacos together as fast as you could snap your fingers!  I had the adobado tacos and carne asada tacos.  Adaboda - other than the pork and pineapple I have no idea what went on my taco but it was MUY BUENO! Same with the carne asada tacos - ME Gusto Mucho!  The service was fast and friendly.  The place was very clean - especially for how busy it was.  It was worth the 20 minute drive.",

Lines move fairly quickly but you can wait up to 30 minutes. But I promise you its definitely  worth it. I'm not a huge fan of the carne asada. It has too much of a smokey flavor in my opition.

    "text": "OH MY TACOS EL GORDO! When you thought you lived in a city with authentic mexican food, Tacos El Gordo... hands down beats it all! THE BEST TACOS. Whether you are drunk or sober, it doesn't matter. I love how this is jam packed & open during early & late hours throughout the day.  * Ordered: - Small Carne Asada Fries (3/4 stars): Sorry, I've tasted better in Southern California so this is just a good back up for your asada needs. A small is shareable for 2 unless you're drunkenly, hungry. - Al Pastor Tacos (5/5 stars): SO good, that I wished I got more than 2! - Asada Tacos (4/5 stars): Squeeze the lime all over & you're good to go. I think picking asada for tacos are better than the fries. - Horchata (3/5 stars): Too small for it's price, but good enough to wash down the tacos.  - They have a salsa & lime bar  * Concept: 1) Come in, pick your \"MEAT line.\" They have specific lines for all their meats from al pastor to asada to pork to beef to beef tongue & more!  2) Ask them what you want between tacos, fries, tostadas, sopes, mulas, quesadillas & drinks. They'll grill the meat in front of you!  3) Take it to go, they'll wrap it in foil for you or dine in, they'll simply put it on a plate hot & fresh for you to eat!  4) Pay at the registers.  5) Finding a table here can get difficult, but when you keep an eye out, people leave left & right here & there. We didn't wait very long to sit down because most tables were in groups.   6) They have workers coming around cleaning up & take your trays & trash when you are done eating.   Do not be intimidated by the lines & crowd. For a Friday night, lines were fast, got our food cooked fast, & the only line that was longer here was to pay because they only have 2 registers. This is THE SPOT to eat before, during, or after partying in Vegas!  GRACIAS, Tacos El Gordo!  ps - This isn't the only location! (North LV & the strip)",

Also, the lines are so long we were there over an hour to get served! My boyfriend used to go to the original location in TJ and loved it, so we were so excited to try it out here.

    "text": "I'm a huge fan of this place!!  One thing I really missed about LA is their tacos.  From guisados to the taco trucks, to the ones on the street with the ladies cooking on a cart...I miss all of it.  Tacos have been really hard to find in Vegas.  I am personally not a big fan of tex mex tacos...I want straight up street tacos with nothing but meat, cilantro and onions and the occasional sauce.  I've tried tacos at cardenas and I think they are decently good.  When I went to tacos el gordo on a Friday night, there was of course a line.  It moved fast though.  This place is unique in that they have several lines.  Lines depend on the meat you want on your tacos.  They have everything from lengua to tripe to asada to al pastor.  They didn't have carnitas though.  I lined up for their infamous spicy pork line.  When I went up to the guy, I asked for 2 spicy pork and one al pastor...he told me they were the same thing.  I thought that was weird because I thought they were different.  Anyhow, got 3 tacos and asked them for pineapples (complimentary) on the side.    I went to another line to pay.  Finding seats can be hard on a busy night but people eat fast and you just have to keep an eye out.  I loved the tacos!!  More expensive than the dollar ones I used to get on the streets of LA but they were really tasty.  I loved the green sauce that it comes with as well.  The spicy pork is not spicy at all!  The look of it reminds of chinese roast pork because of its red exterior...but I didn't quite know how the mean taste like alone.  I just know that as a combination it was wonderful.  I can't wait to go back again!!  My friends also got the lengua and asada.  Honestly the asada was not that good.  It tasted like a hamburger to me...anyone else agree?  The lengua was really good though.  It was large chunks of tender and flavorful meat.  When I go back, I don't think I'll order anything but the al pastor though =).",

    "text": "Yes, the tacos are pretty pricey. $2 a piece whereas I can find tacos for as little as $0.50 in Orange County.. Is worth it? Hell yeah it is!!!  Everything is prepared fresh in front of you (meat, tortilla). You get in line according to what meat you want on your order (there's carne asada, lengua, cabeza, adobada, buche, and tripa). Lines can get pretty long around lunch time; I recommend you go in the late afternoon or late non-weekend evenings. If you want different meats, best method is to divide and conquer. Have friends order in the other lines while you wait for yours!   Carne asada and al pastor are the meats I always go for. Tortillas are thick to avoid ripping since the meat is so juicy (plus you'll probably be adding tons of salsa). You can choose to add everything to your order; everything meaning guac, onions, and salsa. Radish and lime are at the side bar.  Unique here is what they call \"Campechana Fries\" ($10), which is Carne Asada and Al Pastor added together! Super delicious. Fries were not soggy at all and meat was tender and juicy. Highly recommend this option if you're not into the whole finger food ordeal! *Campechana fries can come with or without chili cheese*",

Almost everyone that eats late night or has a recommendation for other than regular eats on the strip, will utter this name.  The food wasn't bad, hell, it was good and flavorful like a lot of places in L.A. I would even dare to say a bit better. The service, well, I don't expect much, but it was satisfactory. The thing that makes no sense to me at all, the ordering system. Why is there 1 person and a separate line for a selection of meats? Why?! The lines would move so much quicker if they had people in the back cutting up said meats while 4-5 counter people take orders. Nope, they think having 1 guy handling each specific meat and 1 guy handling sides (grilled peppers, onions) is the way to go.  Well, it's not. It's a huge and annoying clusterf**k of people in line. It just makes no sense. Then, I wanted to buy an agua fresca, but no one told me how to get a cup. What? I ended up with a can of Coke.   Meats and wares are good, but again, don't get the system of ordering and considering this is quite some ways away from the strip and the wait for food I can get in a good taqueria in L.A., I'll pass.",

So they have three lines and each line services different tacos so depending on what you want you may have to go thru 3 different lines. Then you go to the cashier and pay and get a drink also if you want. They do have a salsa and lime bar to help yourself. Literally it was packed with Latinos which meant it was authentic and a good place to get tacos. I was like one of the only non Latinos in the joint.   The tacos are small but jammed with meat and flavor. Very tasty, wish I could have tried all the tacos. They do have a variety, I tried the carne asado which was tasty and the balance of flavors were right on. I also tried the adobada (spicy pork) which looked like sharma where they shave the meat off very tender and flavorful. I believe that's one of their specialty tacos. The tacos are priced at $2.25 each. They do have loaded fries and some other items.   Plenty of parking well lit lot since the neighborhood could be a bit shady at night. There was an armed security in the restaurant which makes you feel better.   I definitely will go back since now I feel comfortable on the ordering system and how everything works there. 3 tacos and bottle water was a little over $9 dollars. The price per taco could be a bit cheaper in my opinion but way cheaper than eating on the strip and the food is pretty good quality. All the workers there were very friendly.",

This place was definitely less crowded which was a plus! The downside is that there are two separate lines for al pastor & carne asada. We only waited in the carne asada line but we ordered a al pastor quesadilla which they helped us get instead of making us wait again in the other line (how nice of them!)  The al pastor quesadilla was AMAZING. It was an open face quesadilla and the cheese was grilled onto the tortilla, leaving a crispy crunchy cheese layer and they then put the juicy al pastor on top. I was in heaven. Next time I'm definitely getting this !!! I already think the tacos are awesome but this was on a whole other level!   We also got the carne asada tacos, always delicious!   Definitely must come by and it's close to freemont too! :)",

    "text": "I had to visit this place twice before I could write my review. My first visit didn't go so well a few months ago. However, I think it may have been my fault.  I ordered the adobada fries the first time around, and was not impressed. The fries were soggy, and didn't hold up well to the mountain of toppings that were piled on top. In my opinion, the fries need to be crispy so you can pick them up and eat them like nachos. I also ordered no sour cream on my fries, and somehow my order arrived with extra sour cream.  Since I had waited almost 20 minutes for the fries, I didn't feel like waiting even longer by sending them back. Instead, I tried to eat underneath the sour cream  and focus on what was good- THE ADOBADA.  The gentleman with the jungle knife cuts from the hanging pork with precision. I decided to try the tacos this time around. With a few quick strokes, the perfect amount of pork falls into two corn tortillas and the choice is yours on what comes next. You can add cilantro, onions, salsa, avocado, and pineapple. I chose to skip the avocado sauce-- as it is just too runny. I would prefer real slices of avocado rather than this watered down version of green goo. I am not a huge fan of pineapple, but somehow this could be the best thing that ever happened to a taco. The flavor combination will make your head spin. My only small complaint is that the salsa is too mild for my liking. I was in a hurry, so I forgot to get one of those roasted jalapenos off the grill.   This place doesn't offer rice or beans, but with tacos this good -- I honestly didn't miss them. The tacos were $2.00 a piece, and I put down three with relative ease. On a good day, it would probably take 4 or 5 to fill me up, On the other hand, I probably shouldn't be eating that much anyway - TAKE IT EASY FAT BOY!   5 stars for the tacos  Minus 1 star for no rice and beans and terrible fries.",

Tacos El Gordo is precisely Mexico's version of McDonald's. Unhealthy, greasy, and DELICIOUS.  When you walk in, there are taco stations making different types of tacos. Each meat comes with a unique blend of sauces to enhance the flavor. So, for example, carne asada comes with guacamole, adobada does not. When you order your tacos, they'll ask if you want everything on it, if you say yes, they give you all the sauces that are recommended with that meat. I also ways go for \"everything on it,\" haven't been disappointed yet.  Tacos are $2 each. It's simple, it's fast, and it's yummy, yummy, yummy.",

It's a bit small and looks like it was either an old Wendy's or Carl's Jr. that was closed down and rebuilt into Tacos El Gordo, so the seating areas are that of a typical fast food restaurant.  However, the food there is pretty good. It's one of the best taco places I've been to yet and it's decently priced. I believe it was a little over $2 for majority of the tacos, I personally liked any of the steak/beef ones as I do not eat pork, but from what my friend told me the spicy pork is definitely one to try.   The Adobada fries are definitely something everyone should try when they first visit or never had it. It's actually really good. But if you're not with anyone or want to have tacos and the fries, I do however suggest getting the half order. The full order is about $10 but it is something that is either a meal itself or needs to be shared with at least 2+, otherwise you'll have leftovers to take home or a very full stomach!",

I really wanted to like these tacos - as reminiscent of authentic tacos of a bygone era - but this is NOT that place, sadly. Points for simply good food & authentic ambience. Would I make the trek back ? Probably not - but nothing here is offensive (great late night smells); this is just a good taco shack -- if you stumble upon it.",

    "text": "It's like getting authentic street tacos, but in a nice clean restaurant with tables to eat on. There are so many choices of meat! But luckily the tacos are 2-biters (or 3 if you take small bites) so you can try a variety of different kinds. My favorite is the Adobado- or spicy pork. I feel like that one packed the most punch.   My fiance got the carne asada fries and he wasn't too overly impressed. He didn't like that the cheese was cold and wasn't melted, so it wasn't as epic as he thought. But maybe the adobado fries would have been better with the spicy meat. We'll have to try that out next time :)",

I get mine extra crispy, which they fry it up and makes it taste 10 times better. ALSO the onions are so good... esp the green onion!  It was $2 per taco, but it really does fill you up because they pack on the meat! THey even put avocado/guac on top which is sooooooooooooo delish.   One other downside is you can't put on your own onions,etc... they only have the beets & lime self serve.",

There are three lines, the left is for beef, right is for their spicy pork and the middle is everything else.  So, after waiting in one line then grabbing your food, you have to get into another line to order something else.  By that time, my tacos were a little cold.    **Tip** If you pretend your ignorant and order everything in one line, you might be able to get away with it.  :)",

Carne Asada (5): again, moist and flavorful with a slight char. Tostadas are crispy with their handmade tortillas and the fries are nice and cheesy.   Chorizo (3): im normally a huge fan of chorizo but this is the only meat that I had that I thought was lacking a bit. Still decent flavor but I thought it was a little too moist. Almost just like ground pork.   Cabeza (5): super tender, like melt in your mouth tender.   They give you a plate of grilled green onions and chiles which were also amazing. If you're craving tacos, this is the place! Also much less crowded than the location in the strip.",

However, driving through Vegas, I did not want to deal with walking through The Strip in 110 degrees heat, so I decided to try their downtown location instead.   Parking: Easy to locate. It's in a huge shared lot in a shopping plaza. I found parking right in front of the restaurant!   Restaurant: It's so hot in Vegas during the summer, even the AC in the restaurant could barely keep anyone cool. It was extremely packed with limited tables. The ordering process is very confusing. There are 3 separate lines depending on what you want to order, you order first and pay after. The line for their Al Pastor is inside! The tacos are a bit pricey, about $2.25 for one, but they give you plenty of meat.   Tacos: I ordered myself an Asada and two Al Pastor. I personally love the Asada, the guacamole they put on it is amazing especially when paired with their red salsa. I like that the beef isn't bland and is salted perfectly. I could eat 5 more of these! The Al Pastor was okay, I like how when you ask them to put everything on it, they throw on the onions and cilantro and their red salsa so you don't have to do all of the work. I felt I've had better Al Pastor before, but this one is decent too. If you want extra salsa, you have to ask for it!   Overall experience here was great. These tacos were just what I was craving for after an entire weekend of hiking. It's definitely pricier than the typical dollar tacos I normally get back at home, but it definitely lives up to the hype! I can't wait to come here again in the future at their California locations!",

I've been to the one in Las Vegas and San Diego and it's very consistent throughout both locations.   If you're a first timer, make sure you get in line right away that's serving the meat you'd like. (There's a sign above each line with the meat it's serving) If you go with a group, even better. Split up so you have people in each line. That way you can try different meats without waiting twice as long. It's usually always really busy so keep that in mind if you're on a time crunch.",

So I'll start with the chaos you should prepare yourself for, prior to coming in at a busy time. There are 3 lines depending on what meat you want to order, these lines are pretty much in between those who are already eating and those who are about to pay, AND those trying to grab drinks, napkins, etc...place can get really packed!   Carne Asada Fries- more like fries & asada in your guac! They were actually pretty good but overload on the guac. Meh. Tacos- Al Pastor, buche, and asada were all decent, I was expecting more from the asada but not bad!  Asada Sope - really soggy, not a fan, didn't finish it.  They also have Nopales(cactus), which are probably my favorite to add on my tacos and they grill them for you here! Thumbs up on that!",

As stated, there are 3 lines depending on what kind of meat you want.  And they each line has only ONE person working it!!!  You read that right.  ONE freakin' person to work a line that sometimes has as many 50 people in it!!!  Well, no wonder the damn lines are so long!!  ONE person to take your order, cook your food, and prepare your food!!  I'm surprised he doesn't take your money too!!  Absolutely ridiculous!!  I don't know which genius came up with this stupid idea.  You would think with all the money they're making, they could afford to hire a few more people to help them out.  I'm not kidding......we were in line for almost 2 hours!!!  If you drive by and see a long line, do yourself a favor and and don't waste your time and go somewhere else!!!  Unless you want to wait in line for at least an hour!  There's a Taco Mexican right down the street, which is also pretty damn good!!    I'm never coming back here again, unless there's a short or no line at all.  What a waste of time!!!",

A 10-minute drive and wait at this location trumps that.  We got horchata, carne Asada fries and tacos al pastor.  Carne Asada Fries: Even the small portion was a lot. Warm fried potatoes loaded with cheese, carne Asada and guac. 4/5  Tacos al Pastor: Spicy meat. Yup, that's all I can remember so, I'm not even going to attempt to be descriptive about it. 4/5  We were the only Chinos in this area at 3am. It's all good.",

    "text": "Yet again, Yelp delivers. Hungry and on the hunt for something local, we came across Tacos El Gordo on Yelp. In an unassuming shopping center off the Las Vegas Strip we found this little gem.....thank you Yelp.  Walking in, the place can be somewhat overwhelming. There's like 200 things on the menu (ok, I'm exaggerating a little) and you can line up in like 10 different lines. Depending on what kind of meat you want - you go to that line. They cook the meat fresh - in your face. Right on the grill - a few feet away. Sure, this means you will smell like smoke for the rest of the day, but with casinos in Vegas being smoking and all, I rather smell like carne asada than cigarettes.  I got:   Sope de asada - Whoa! This thing was pretty massive. It was a fried dough (?) with a ton of toppings like salsa, guac, onions, cilantro and of course carne asada - with a crispy chip on top.  Tacos asada - Two tacos with carne asada. Awesome!   The wife got some quesadillas - they were a little small, but the cheese was so good! I think it was a white cheese for frying. Pretty tasty.  We washed it all down with some Horchata! They have two machines for fountain drinks - one for regular soft drinks and the other one for traditional Mexican drinks! Pretty cool - I would of liked to try some of the other drinks, but was pretty stuffed.  The staff was all surprisingly nice. With as busy as everyone seemed they didn't hesitate to answer our questions (the folks cooking all the meat). The cashier was a bit of a character (hey, it's Vegas!) but SUPER nice as well.",

I only ordered the carne asada tacos and the adobada tacos which I absolutely loved. The carne asada tacos has guac on it, and the adobada tacos has two different kinds of salsa on it. My friends also tried buche but said it wasn't as good as carne asada. These were hands down the best tacos I've ever had in the States! The only downside is the wait - both times we went had at least an hour wait. Also, be sure you're in the right line because they have different lines depending on what kind of meat you want!",

I absolutely loved there asada taco! One of the best I've had. They give a lot of meat on each taco and put on your sauces for you.   The half adobada and half asada fries were to die for. This was a large portion and the price was decent.   Parking was a breeze and since this location is off the strip, it wasn't too crowded when we went.",

I gave it four stars because the process of getting the taco's is as big a mess as other reviews state. You go in and there are three separate lines. So, to get and Al Pastor taco you get in one line. Then if you want a Carne Asada taco you then get in another line. The problem is the line for Carne Asade had 25 or more people in it when I got my tacos. So you stand in a ten to fifteen minute line and then get into another fifteen minute line before you check out. There aren't near enough places to sit so I got it to go and ate in my car. So, long lines, poorly organized, and not enough places to sit and eat. If you can deal with that you get the best little street tacos you have ever had. Will I go back? YES! But I go realizing it is a cluster*#^ to get your food and that I will eat in my car. As a final comment, I went at 12:30 pm on Sunday. Based on reviews this place must always be slammed. If the owners could come up with a better food delivery organizational system and franchise this food they would be uber rich. I'd want a couple of their stores.",

Each one was a party in my mouth - a party catered by Hubert Keller.  In all seriousness, these tacos were amazing. I've loved Mexican food most of my life, and having lived in the southwest, I thought I'd gotten a pretty good sampling without actually going to Mexico. These were fawesome and made me a little sad that I had \"wasted\" 88 tacos' worth of money at L'Atelier de Joel Robuchon the night before. The meat was succulent and flavorful. We requested \"everything,\" so each taco came with its own unique combination of fixings. I was a little nervous when I saw the heaping guacamole, but it was quite good and accentuated the meat flavor well. The giant rotating adobada is the first thing you see when you enter, and it sets the atmosphere perfectly. There's one giant counter. but there are four separate lines (in front of each grill) for ordering. Be mentally prepared to receive your tacos in hand in less than 30 seconds.  Do not be tricked into going to Los Tacos which is right next door. I haven't tried it but I can only assume it's inferior. I mean, it has a drive thru for God's sake!",

Carne asada had a lot of chewy parts and tasted slightly burnt, not much flavor.  I'm not sure what the crispy thing was that they put on top of my quesadilla (it looked like a fried corn tortilla maybe?) but it tasted burnt and gross.  Maybe I wasn't supposed to eat it?  lol, who knows.  The ordering style was weird.  You have to stand in a different line for different types of meat, they load up your tray with your order, and you go to the cashier to pay.  I probably should have said to go in line but I wasn't sure how this place worked so I had to ask the cashier to wrap up my plates to go after I paid.  I'll stick to Los Tacos next door.  Their carne asada is to die for and their quesadillas are a much better value.",

Do you remember when Vince Carter played his only time in the slam dunk contest, threw down his first, thunderous dunk, and stared into the audience, motioning with his hand slitting his throat and mouthed....................\"It's Over\"  That is how i felt after i took my first bite of their Spicy Pork adoboda taco. The search for Vegas's Best Taco has ended.  It's over.  I didn't think it was possible to get an authentic taco in this town.  I been to the self proclaimed \"Robertos\" and the other has-beens where frankly after tonight I'd feed it all to a dog.  We got the cabeza (beef head), lengua (tongue), and the spicy pork adoboda.  When you arrive, there is a secret way of ordering, kind of like In-and-Out.  Based on the meat choice you want, you go to line 1, 2, or 3.  The line closest to the door is where it is at yo..Spicy pork goodness.  Be sure to hit up every line and get your grilled scallions and peppers in line 1.    BEst of all, this place is open till 4am on the weekends.",

I used to be loyal to Pepe's across town, but El Gordo is my new fave.  SO YUMMY!!  Carne asada tacos: A+++ Tacos el pastor: A+++ Service: Fast and friendly.  I love it when they speak Spanish to my friends and then switch to English for me.  Hey, hablo espanol tambien!  If you're converting from Los Tacos across the parking lot, the tacos at El Gordo might look a little small in comparison.  But don't be fooled!  They have five times the flavor and are super cheap so you can buy 13 if you want.  I get my tacos with EVERYTHING and they're delicious, but you can ask for no onions if you're a wimp (like two of my friends).  The tortillas are fresh and sooooooooo yummy.  We'll be driving back to LV for more tacos for sure!",

The adobada taco meat is carved right off the slab and onto your taco.  If you are only going to order one kind of taco, GET THIS ONE.  The workers here are quick and efficient.

    "text": "Adobada (spicy pork) fries get the job done my friends. Oooey, gooey cheese, perfectly marinated spicy pork, sour cream, and spoonfuls of guac top the perfectly fried and crispy fries. I've always been one to get carne asada fries at the Mexican joints down in SD or any other noteworthy spots comparable to those in SD. However, after sampling an adobada taco and a carne asada taco, I was up for trying the adobada fries and I'm glad I did! In my opinion the spicy pork was tastier than the carne asada (which can be seen on a rotating spit), although the carne asada wasn't a bad choice either. Note that an order of adobada (and I assume the same goes for carne asada) fries can be ordered in a medium ($5-$6) or large size ($10). I didn't know the medium existed until the server asked which size I wanted. I'm glad they offered this since I was already full from the two tacos I had sampled earlier!  Yeah, this joint isn't in the best location in Vegas, but that's part of the \"experience\". Hey, if that means there's less tourists, then I'm in! The servers can talk English, so just speak your order without any frills and you should be fine. Or, you can always test out the old Spanish-speaking skills you learned from school or Rosetta Stone!  It's True that there are several lines depending on the meat that you want. The far right corner was for spicy pork and I think carne asada, the next one was for the more \"exotic meats\" (tripe, cabeza, lengua, etc.), the third one to the right was for chorizo, and the last one was for grilled onions, quesadillas and such. Drinks are ordered in the center counter found toward the middle, back part of the room which is where you pay for your items. It's amazing what $2 can get you at this place!",

The adobada meat was not very flavorful and none of my meat had even a hint of crispiness. The avocado sauce they put on top is tasty, but not enough to make the taco great.  The carne asada tacos were alright. They did not put an actual salsa on them and that would have helped a lot in my opinion. The guacamole was a nice touch. This taco also had a bit of mystery meat in it.  My husband also tried the cabeza and lengua tacos. He found them to be very flavorless.  They do give you grilled onions and chiles and they do make their own tortillas, but the tacos are still very overrated. Maybe we came on a bad day and at a bad time, but still, we've had better tacos.  Also, the line system can be confusing. Basically, you order different tacos at each of the stations.",

    "text": "BRAINS! BRAINS! BRAINS!  BRAIN TACOS! I LOVE TO EAT BRAINS!  During a recent lengthy stay in Vegas, I finally found time to get myself from my Old Town/Downtown hotel over to Tacos El Gordo on East Charleston -- a shop which I had known about for a couple of years primarily because of the fact that if offers brain tacos, but had heretofore been unable to visit during earlier Vegas stays simply due to time constraints. Did I mention yet that I love to eat BRAINS, and that I had been dying for several years, during previous visits to Vegas, to visit this shop?  So, I ended up visiting the shop for my very fist time on Tuesday, June 28th at about 12:15 PM;  I would have preferred to have visited the shop at about 11 AM, well before the onslaught of the lunchtime crowds, but my schedule did not allow it, and once I arrived at the shop, the lunch crowd turned out to be quite manageable.  Since I was a total newcomer, once I had arrived at the shop it took me a couple of minutes to figure out in which line I would need to stand in order to order the brain tacos that I was CRAVING, and, still a bit disoriented (largely because I was craving BRAINS), I finally needed to ask one of the chefs at one of the shorter lines, and he quickly, with a smile, pointed me to the correct line, which luckily turned out to be one of the very short lines (unlike the very long line for ordering pork and beef-filled tacos...), with only two people standing in line in front of me. I reached the chef within three minutes of having joined the line.  Best of all, it turned out that this was also the line for ordering tripe (stomach) tacos, which happened to be the only other type of taco filling in which I was interested. Did I mention yet that I love to eat BRAINS, and that my very favorite brain meal of all time is BRAIN TACOS?  The ordering process, once I had figured it out, was great, and easy, and the chef on my line was great; he was obviously very happy (but then again, who wouldn't be happy if they were standing in front of a large bowl of scrambled BRAINS?) and he had a funny sense of humor. In very short order, he made up my large batch of brain tacos to go, replete with the exact toppings that I wanted on them (I love onions and some of the other toppings that were available at his station, but hate chopped raw cilantro, and the chef was great about avoiding the cilantro on my behalf...). Did I mention yet that I love to eat BRAINS, and that my very favorite brain meal of all time is BRAIN TACOS?  When I reached the check out counter, I discovered, to my great pleasure, that they had at least two kinds of homemade hot sauce, each in small plastic cups with lids, stored in the fridge that they could and would pack with my order upon request. (When I got back to the hotel with my food, I discovered that both the red and the green hot sauces were GREAT!) They also had great medium-sized cups of rice pudding (with cinnamon on top) available in the cooler behind the cashier as well, at a very cheap price. I ended up getting several cups of the hot sauces, and also ordering five cups of rice pudding to bring back to my hotel room with me, since I still had about 5 days of my stay in Vegas ahead of me. However, what excited me the most was the simple fact that I would shortly be leaving the shop with a bag in my hands that was filled with BRAIN tacos! Did I mention yet that I love to eat BRAINS, and that my very favorite brain meal of all time is BRAIN TACOS?  I ate some of the very delicious brain tacos 20 minutes later for my lunch in my hotel room, and the leftover tacos served as my lunch meal again the next day. Did I mention yet that I love to eat BRAINS, and that my very favorite brain meal of all time is BRAIN TACOS?  My only regret is that during my first and only visit to the shop, I had not ordered more of the brain tacos. I should have ordered about 20 of them, and then stuffed them all (well, except for the few that I would eat for my lunch that first day) in the fridge in my hotel room. In case I have not yet mentioned this fact, I love to eat BRAINS, and that my very favorite brain meal of all time is BRAIN TACOS. In fact, BRAIN TACOS ares even better than BRAINS in tomato sauce on pasta, and even better than fried BRAINS.  In closing, I want to say that I love to eat brains. And my favorite brain meal of all time is brain tacos. The brain tacos and the tripe tacos from this shop were beyond excellent. The service at the shop was also excellent. I only wish that I had ordered more of each to bring back to my hotel room, as I had a large fridge in the room that could have held lots of BRAIN tacos!   I am seriously thinking of moving full-time to Vegas, to a small apartment located just a few feet from the front door of this shop, just so that I can eat BRAIN tacos for each of my three meals each day! Did I mention yet that I love to eat BRAINS?  Will definitely visit this fine shop again on my next Vegas trip. BRAINS!",

If its your first time here, it could get pretty confusing but there are 3 separate lines for different kinds of meats so make sure you read the signs. You line up and then order once its your turn. Guess what? Guacamole is FREE. Well... I wouldn't call it Guac, its more of just avocado but still! Other places would be charging you $1 or more for some guac. I would definitely pass on the carne aside fries, its missing a bunch of pico.   After you get your order, you pay. About $2 for tacos is a bit on the pricey side since i'm so used to taco Tuesday but they were worth it!  So we ordered 12 tacos and a large order of carne asada fries and were given 4 small sauces... when we asked for more sauce they said 1 sauce for fries and 1 sauce per 4 tacos. Not sure how they came to that conclusion because my sister loves putting sauce on everything, but they wanted to charge us $0.50 for each additional sauce. No thanks.   Horchata was decent. 3 tacos definitely wasn't enough for me because they're small so I would recommend getting 4 or 5. Also DO NOT GET THE FLOUR TORTILLA. The corn tortilla tasted amazing.",

I was still drunk from the night before (heh) but I remember three lines that had different meat in each line. I was too lazy so I just stood in the line for the al pastor. You go up to the window and you say how many tacos you want, and you get to admire the meat being freshly cut right before your very eyes. Then you take your tacos and get into another line to pay. They accept credit card so yay!  I ordered 3 al pastor tacos and it was SO GOOD. I was drooling as I was eating my tacos. The meat was exceptional. It was moist, tender, and flavorful; as is whatever sauce they place on top of the meat. I may have regretted eating tacos for breakfast later in the day but it was all worth it from what I can recall.  Tacos El Gordo lives up to the hype and I feel bad that there's another taco place like right next to it that may go out of business...",

A couple of years ago I stumbled upon Tacos El Gordo one drunken night, the lines were confusing so I ended up getting tacos de adobada. That day I tasted heaven. Since that night I have been to Tacos El Gordo every time I've been in Vegas and also the location in San Diego. My girlfriend and I were in Vegas this past weekend and we just had to have these tacos, twice. While my reviews are strictly for the tacos de adobada, which are more addictive than crack, my girlfriend seems to like the asada tacos as well. Why won't they come to LA already",

    "text": "\"What is cabeza?\"  I stupidly question my bud (an American via Mexico).  \"It's you know.\" he says, using two hands to point to his crotch.  \"What the?  I'm not eating penis tacos!\" I say to an explosion of laughter.  \"No, no, no.\" he chokes, now pointing to his head.  Having been many times before with Spanish speaking buds who handle all the ordering and just watch me eat their handiwork, I decided on this fateful visit to learn for myself what it's about.  That said, Tacos El Gordo serves up incredible, if not the best tacos in Vegas.   House made tortillas.  Generous portions of flavorful house made beef and pork.  Tacos made to order on the spot.  Fresh veg and a great extra (grilled peppers and onions that are so good, they can be eaten alone).  Outstanding  \"normal\" proteins including:  - Carne Asada - well marinated, juicy, deeply flavored flank or skirt.  Hint of acidity. - Adobada - The venerable pillar of meat, carved by a weapon.  Mildly spicy, juicy, seared finish adding a good bitter edge.  Offal selections include:  - Cabeza (face) - The best of all the protein selections.  Fatty, liquefied gelatin, moist beefy goodness.   - Lengua (tongue) - very good beef flavor with a mineral finish.  Excellent, slightly chewy texture. - Tripa (tripe) - Clean, almost milky with a slight bitter, organ meat finish.  Chewy and tasty. - Buche (pig stomach) - Not for everyone.  Mild hint of mineral bitterness. - Sesos (cow brain) - Definitely not for everyone.  Creamy, aggressively seasoned, strong mineral flavor.  In your face flavors.  (it lacks the mild flavor and finesse of a calf brain).  Straight forward, efficient counter service.  Strange multi line ordering system (one line for this, another for that).  Very low prices ($2 - $2.25 per taco).  In a word:  outstanding.",

Oh well, doesn't matter because the lines here were still ridiculous, even at 3am..so business must still be good. I love love love their spicy pork and carne asada tacos! They already include sauces in them so that's why they don't have a sauce bar. Plus they include guac on them!!! That's 5 stars right there! I also got their sopes but they weren't as good as  the tacos. I really like the melted cheese though! btw, you can ask for grilled veggies! its free and goes great with them tacos!",

    "text": "Main Foods: Tacos with Meat  Price: $  Date Visited: April, 2015  Verdict: I did not know Tacos can taste like gold.  Be prepared to line for a long time cause this place is popular. There are separate lines for different types of meat so make sure you line up for the pork (my recommendation, but generally the longest line). The staff are extremely efficient though. Best go if you're in town.  Adobada: This spiced pork reminds me of the taste of Char Siu (BBQ Pork in Canto Cuisine). The warm juice flows from the pork itself and fuses with the cold sauce; the pork is well spiced and prepared as it complements the crisp yet soft tortilla. The only complain: WHY THE HELL IS THIS SO SMALL. I ordered 3 and still did not have enough of it. Going to get more the next time I go to Vegas.  I lost my memory here I only remember this as one of the beef. (Should be either Suadero or Cabeza) The beef is crispy and is a bit blander than the previous taco. But it serves as an excellent transition taco before the Adobada",

BEST TACOS I'VE HAD IN A VERY, VERY LONG TIME & I THINK THE BEST IN VEGAS????  I'm the type of person that orders the weirdest thing on the menu. So of course I had to order the Lengua & Cabeza! The cabeza is AMAZING. So flavorful! The lengua was equally as good, but cabeza is by far my favorite (I order it anytime I see it on any menu).  I love the atmosphere of this place as well. It's nothing fancy at all, but I just love seeing the families in here and how busy it is, idk, it makes me happy. also-- FREE REFILLS ON FOUNTAIN DRINKS. HOLLAHHH.

I'm not coming back until they fix that line situation.   At TEG you have to get in a different line for every item you are ordering. After waiting for 15 minutes to collect all of your food, you have to fight your way back through the line toward the cashier, near the exit. Then, after paying for your food, you fight your way back through the line to the far corner of the room to fill up your drink. Then, you fight your way back through the line again and hopefully you can find a seat in the always packed dining room.   It's just not worth the hassle. And if you can't speak spanish, I would bring someone who can. It will make things a whole lot easier.",

There are two things I could eat everyday and as non-foodie as it may sound they happen to be Mexican food and NY style pizza. This place was hands down one of the best Mexican spots I have been too!  The restaurant appears chain-ish at first glance and looks like nothing special. However, the charcoal smell looming over the parking lot is your first hint that you are in for the real deal.  The setup is order yourself, pay and eat; simple and perfect.    I apparently signed up for my own eating contest because I ordered 2 pork, 1 lengua, and 1 cow brain taco (don't know the Spanish term..I can hardly ask for agua), annnd split the carne asada fries - unbelievable!  The pork tacos were hands down the best I have ever had!!  They are shaved right from a slab of meat as the orders roll in so it appears in strips as oppose to the chunks/cubes or \"flakes\" as you may be use to.  Its appearance oddly reminded me of pork in a Chinese restaurant. The lengua was fresh, tender, and just right. The cow brains, don't judge me,  I was trying for the first time. I thought them to be more tender and even better than the lengua!!  One aspect of the tacos that made them so good were the toppings they are loaded with the best ingredients and \"salsas\" which only my pics can properly describe.The carne asada fries (also have pork option) were amazing! They are very similar to McDonald cut and tasting fries, which I secretly love, and the fresh cooked steak was nearly infused with smoke from the fresh charcoal grill it was cooked on.   This is not a hoity-toity Mexican restaurant so keep that in mind when considering.  Most of the places I frequent that have the best Mexican you can get a few tacos and a pair of cowboy boots if you wanted.  They are hole in the wall places that dish up awesome food.  This is one of those places (minus the boots) and it is a must have if you are an authentic Mexican lover like myself.  Enjoy!!  Kent",

    "text": "This place very easily deserves my 5 stars Their Tacos de Adobada tasted like sex in my mouth. Yup... if you don't believe me try one and try saying it doesn't taste that good.   OMG if you are on vacation or even live here you have got to come try some of their tacos. I'm honestly not much of a taco guy. I usually stick to my burritos but I ordered 2 Adobada (spicy pork) tacos, 1 Lengua (tongue) , 1 Asada (beef ) and it more than filled me up.   What makes this place special is their Tacos de Adobada I know alot of places don't have this and thats why its awesome.   Here is a tip though. It is confusing if it is your first time to order food here. You go up the counter to order what kind of meat you want with 4 or 5 people working behind the counter based on the meat of choice. Go all the way right say two Adobada tacos. The guy tacos up  right there and hands it to you. I asked for three types of tacos and he pointed down the line after I got the Adobada and so i moved to the next meat lady.",

I always order the al pastor tacos and eat a few bites of my husbands cow tongue tacos. (The cow tongue is extremely tasty, but I can't get rid of the mental barrier enough to eat whole ones). We've tried random taco places and vendors around town, and none of them are as good as this place so we keep returning. My husband lived in Mexico for a few years and even said these are the closest to authentic he's been able to find. You can get flour tortilla's instead of corn if you just ask.",

They have three different lines where you order different kinds of meat or so that's how it appears. Little did we know that you can pretty much get in any line and order whatever you want. They should make that clear because it can be somewhat confusing. Anyhow once we finally got all our tacos they were good, the adobada, tripa and taco azteca were my favorite. They did in fact taste like TJ tacos. A bit pricey though, typically a taco runs you about $1.00-$1.50 but here they are $2.00 and they are not big....2-3 bites.",

It's time to man up, adjust your nut sack, hike up your trousers and get down with some more unfamiliarable less desirable \"of courses I mean by American standards\" fleshy fatty gems of the animal kingdom.  Cabasa and buche are king at Tacos El Gordo.  Melt in your mouth tender gelatiness nasty bits that will turn your wanna be foodie ass on it's side. I mean it's all good but these two cuts are out of this world.  Lets just put it this way, If Tacos El Gordo was Oceans 11 the cabasa would be George Clooney and the buche is Brad Pitt the other tacos, like the rest of the supporting cast, kick ass however there can only be one Clooney. OK, I know its not your typical analogy however, I'm sure you follow me. Well follow me or not all you need to know is that this place is crazy good.  If I had to point out anything negative it would be that it's a little pricey, however this is definitely one of those you get what you pay for situations.",

Thankfully Tacos El Godo has all their tacos for 2 bucks, their quesadillas for 4 and horchata for 1.40. Usually shady taco places skimp on their meat, but no way jose, this place gives you enough carne asada in one taco to make two tacos. My friends got their famous pork adoabab tacos, which they couldn't stop raving about. From about 1-4 am on the weekend, this place has huge lines, but they move quickly. They have separate lines for the types of tacos you want, so make sure you get in the right one. I ate here 5 times during my 4 day stay in Vegas, and it never got old. The guac/tomoatoes/onion combo that they put on your tacos is superb. Also they have steamed vegetables/onions/peppers that are free, but you have to as for it with your meal. And you might as well get the horchata while you are here - because the food is spicy as it gets...you will need something to cool off.",

Make the trip; you won't be disappointed. Try the brains, intestines, or head. And if you're upset that they are priced at 2$ a piece, I'm sure you'll find Taco Bell a more suitable establishment...

There are 3 different lines and each one has different tacos that you can order. I went into one line to order one type and once I got it, I stood in the next line to get the other ones. My favorite was the carne asada. I was very surprised to see horchata coming out of the soda machine!!! I could not believe it! I love horchata so I had to give it a try but i was disappointed. It was watery and tasteless. Don't get the horchata!!! Limited seats and they fill up fast so you might have to get your order to go.",

They ran out of al pastor at 5:30 pm lol. Was told to go to their other side across the parking lot. Al pastor was dry. Asada was a little bland. What's really bad is depending on what type of meat you want you have to get in another line so if you're by yourself you'll have to get in another long line. The good....hand made tortillas. But Won't be coming back here.",

Tacos El Gordo breaks up the lines by meat choice. Since my husband and I wanted asada and pastor, we separated to get in each line. It took SO long but we finally got our food. I think we spent more time waiting than actually eating. FINALLY, we got to the front of the line, and you're immediately handed your order. Made fresh right in front of you. WOW! The wait was worth it. I don't know what they do to this meat, but the flavor is beyond!   My husband and I promptly fell into a food coma following our visit here. I can't wait to come back!",

The one and only thing that I don't fully understand is why I had to make 3 lines to get the tacos I want?! There's 3 different lines to get tacos. One is for asada and chorizo another one for cabeza, tripas, suadero and buches and a 3rd one to get your al pastor tacos! So if you want asada, suadero and al pastor you have to wait in a long line 3 times to get your tacos. Amazing tacos but they need to think of a way to show appreciation to costumers for choosing them by not making us get in 3 different lines to get our tacos!",

The Tacos El Gordo chain has been commercialized and very dissapointed with the quality of food they serve.

This is super inconvenient if you don't come with someone else.  I ordered the adobada tacos and adobada fries. The food itself was good. Was it worth the almost one hour process? Hell no.

So when I saw that they had one in Vegas I was so excited. I came here two days in a row and each time I was greeted by friendly food preparers who cut the meat right in front of you.  The first day I came here at around 2am and there was a line that took about 15 minutes. The second day, I came around 5pm and of course the line was much longer and it took about 30 minutes to get my food and there wasn't any seating.   These tacos are amazing and a must try are the Al Pastor/Adobada tacos. They're at a great price and a whole meal can cost you under $10. It's a perfect place to visit for a late night meal and they're open until 3am. I wish they had one in Los Angeles.",

    "text": "BEST. TACOS. IN. VEGAS.  Yes, THEE best! Just when I was convinced that the taco game sucked in Vegas, I found Tacos El Gordo and all my taco dreams came True.  Some people might not know how the ordering here works, so here are some tips. First, you order and wait to pick up your food, then you pay at the cashier. Depending on the type of meat you want, you have to stand in that specific line. Once you have your food, you go to the cashier where you pay. The soda machine is on the opposite side of the cashier. Tables could be hard to find, so when you see an open table you better go grab it. This place is popular all times of the day, so don't wait for the crowds to die down or you will never get to eat. If you have multiple people in your group, have one person can stand in each line and then one person save a table. Now that's teamwork!  -Al pastor is the fav here. It's not my usual taco order, but when I am here I get the Al Pastor. Make sure you get it with everything on it. Ask for pineapple, mmm! I ordered 2 tacos on corn tortillas. Also I am not usually a corn tortilla kind of gal, but from here.. Yes!   -Carne asada was amazing as anticipated. I ordered tacos and the fries-- best decision I've made all week. Ask for peppers on the side. The carne asada fries reminded me of all my favorite spots back in SoCal. This place hits the spot.  Protip-- ORANGE BANG. Unlimited refills of delicious orange bang. Reminds me of my childhood in LA! They also have horchata and tamarind. I can drink a kiddie pool full of orange bang. No shame in my orange bang game.",

There are three different lines, one for the pork adobada, one for carne asada and one for the remaining meats.  Get in your line, order your food (Tacos, sopes, fries, etc.), they give it to you and you go pay.  Order drinks and get salsa at the register.  The pork adobada is absolutely the star of the show.  They serve it with some pico de gallo, optional pineapple (i recommend it), an avocado cream and onions with cilantro.",

The lines are set up by meat choices, you hv to wait in a 45min line to get carne asada.. u get your carne asada & hv to go to the end of the al pastor line to get that particular meat ..then go to the line to pay for your food. It's super crowded so hopefully by the time u hv waited in long ass lines you can find a table to eat your now cold ass tacos. Way too complicated for tacos. I was starving by the time i got my food so i can't really say the specifics on the flavors or taste of what i got. What did stand out to me was that my quesadilla was burnt on top.. really disappointing& i remember the salsa being very good... I ate 2 carne asada tacos, 1 al pastor taco & a carne asada quesadilla. I wouldn't return to this taco spot because it's jus way to complicated, they should really consider changing their set up.",

Oh yea and they didn't have AC when it was friggin 110 outside.....common on now, I can tell this used to be a Wendy's or some fast food stand so I know there must have been ac before....skip the lines and hype and go somewhere else cause this place was a disappointment....",

In comparison to their strip location, I felt like this location had better tasting adobada. Plus, it's less busy and I check out my food much faster.   If you've NEVER been to tacos el gordo, you just go to the counter with food and order right away of what you want. There's usually a carne asada line and an adobada line. After you get your food, then you go to the counter to pay.   Must try:  - tacos of your choice ( my fave is the adobada, you can ask for pineapple in it)  - campechana fries (carne asada + adobada. SO YUM!   Honestly can't wait till my next cheat day to come here.",

But I've been coming down to this area for years to find places just like this! Yes, it's straight out of South L.A. with all the questionable characters walking around. Be aware of your surroundings, and mind your own business, and enjoy some damn good tacos! The place occupies a old Wendy's and you have three lines to which to decide to get in. There's a line for Asada and Chorizo tacos, one for pastor and variations of it, and another for beef tongue and tripa. Pick one and get in line and the lines are long! It's worth it, and when you get up there you can always ask for something from the other line. The flour and corn tortillas are hand made and pressed before your eyes! The Asada was flame grilled before your eyes and lathered with a guacamole spread and salsa! Knock you out with the first bite! The spicy pork was equally as impressive, and this all left me thinking. Why aren't our good neighbors from the south of us just mass producing such great goodness as this!! This southern gentleman left thinking when you find a taco joint like this, and there's not many, appreciate it and find your way back again!!",

Anyways we get there like around 1 am and the place is packed! I was kind of confused on how to order because there were signs in Spanish. But the signs are pretty much telling you where to stand if you want a certain type of tacos/quesadilla etc. So my friend, my boyfriend, and I stood in 3 different lines because we wanted Tacos de Carne Asada, Tacos de Lenguas, and Quesadilla Adobada. The wait time was like about maybe 20 min? But it was worth it!!! When I saw how small the tacos I thought I would still be hungry, but no we I ended up being stuffed!!! This were the BEST TACOS I ever had in my life and I wish Hawaii had this! Oh I forgot to mention my Horchata drink. That was really delicious too!!!",

    "text": "Mouth wateringly delicious! Went there with the fam at 3pm on a Sunday and it was completely packed- long lines and no empty seats- I soon figured out why.   First! You must have the Carne Asada fries!! (A full one if you are hungry and half if your not; $10 well worth the price) they use the real deal carne asada topped with guacamole, cheese, sourcream and their tasty (spicy) green sauce!!   Sencond, I highly reccommend Tacos de Pastor (or adobada as they are called at this location) the green sauce is to die for and Tacos de Cabeza! Cilantro-onions- red or green sauce- and guacamole.  Third, You have to try their Horchata- perfect finish to the meal! A little sweeter than how it normally tastes but still very good.  I was in total shock when I saw that they had BUCHE as not many places have this particular meat on the menu nor is it ever cooked right. I didnt get to try it cuz I was too busy stuffing my face with the Carne asada fries but trust me when I say just looking at it, you could tell it would be good!   If I had to complain about anything, it would be that I wasnt to fond of the way they made the guacamole- it seemed thin and didnt have much flavor, kind of like paste :/ other than that- everthing else was perfect! **TAKE NOTE that there are three or four separate lines each for a different type of meat- Carne Asada-Pork-Pastor*** SO CHECK WITH A COOK OR WORKER BEFORE YOU GET IN LINE!!***",

I went in on July 4th about 7ish and the lines were pretty long and it was a bit confusing on which line to get in but after a couple of minutes my boyfriend and I figured it out. One word BOMB! Sadly I did not get tacos which I regret now I got a half order of the carne asada fries which was delicious no complaints BUT after getting a taste of that MEAT I was like man I should have gotten tacos! The meat seriously had such a good flavor hands down one of the best meat if not the best meat I have tried from a place. Although it would be nice if they could figure out a way to make those lines move faster. But seriously can't wait for my next visit to Vegas to come here again!",

I read all the reviews on here so I wanted to see what all the fuss was about plus k was super super hungry. I think that the tacos were super basic. maybe I feel that way because I'm from LA, and tacos are our thing out there. I had two al pastor and two asasa tacos. The tacos de asada had some guac, I'll pass I didn't like it the tortilla was pretty greasy and the al pastor had a green sauce that wasn't good. Anywho, I guess for twenty bucks it was ok. I'll pass next time though.",

The different lines are annoying. The food was greasy, but you already expect it. I'll stick with Taco y Taco since that's closer (and because I think I prefer it).",

Now that we got that out of the way, the tacos are pretty amazing.  I had the lengua (tongue) tacos, and I must say they were probably the best tongue tacos I have had by far, and I have had quite a few lengua tacos.  The tongue was prepared to the almost-perfect texture, and as my dining companion has described it, the tongue \"was clean\" - pure tongue meat.   And, of course, the adobada tacos were also very delicious.  The grilled pineapple highlights the flavors of the meat and becomes a pleasant surprise in the mouth.    We also had the carne asada, which I thought was quite tasty; however, it was not spectacular.    One thing about Tacos El Gordo is that it is a bit pricey compared to its competition.  At $2.50 a pop for the lengua taco, it is definitely on the high-end side.    Then again, you get what you pay for!  Me gustan tacos!",

I love the system they have... order all your food from the cook, wait seconds while they prepare your taco at lightning speed, then pay at a different station. That's some Mexican efficiency right there.  My favorite, by far, was the lengua taco. The lengua was so tender and so very delicious. Can't go wrong with a whole tray full of lengua tacos and a jamaica to wash it down. The suadero tacos was a bit on the dry side, so not that good. I also tried the pork stomach (I forget the name they had on the menu)... it was soft and tripey, if you like that kind of texture, but the flavor wasn't very strong.  4 to 5 tacos is enough for a whole meal, and with all the different meat choices, works well to give you a good variety. Next time, I'll definitely try the asada fries and the chorizo taco (the chorizo taco menu item is easy to miss).",

These are probably the best tacos Ive ever had, I live in San Antonio, TX and Id say Im somewhat familiar with street taco type places but considering all the high end expensive restaurants I visited while in Vegas, and the fact that the most memorable food I ate on the strip were these awesome tacos says alot.   They added another side to the restaurant itself to make it bigger, probably due to its gaining popularity. The suadera tacos, adobada and carne asada are the best in my opininion. I wanted to try the Lengua but I was just too full.   Im just glad this place has enough recognition that they had to make it bigger. They deserve all the business they get as long as they keep up with the badass tacos.",

Tacos El Gordo is he consummate example of a little hole in the wall place that blows away restaurants who charge triple the price for the same meal.  Typically I'd never even go to this part of town (Charleston and Pecos, I think?) but this place makes it worth it.  On a good day you can smell the meat from almost a block away, and it only gets better as you get closer.    I'm impressed by the quality of the meat and the extra large portions.  My girlfriend loves the selection.  This place has the authentic Mexican varieties like Lingua, cabesa, etc, while most places offer solely beef, pork, fish.  The carne asada fries are great (maybe a little too heavy on the guacamole, but I'm not a fan), and horchatas pour from the soda fountain!  What's not to love!  The only gripe that I can find with this place is that ordering can be a little confusing. There's not really a line..  Or are there several lines blurred into one?  I'm not sure..  But if you throw a couple bucks in the tip jar the chefs will usually walk you through everything and pay special attention to make sure you're good.",

This is not a typical taco stand or a Roberto's that around your corner, this is amazingness in a taco. You start off going up to a different portion of the counter and ordering something that is specific for that portion of the counter. I have tried a lot of different kinds of tacos, but the most appealing taco for me is the adobada taco. The meat is cut off a rotating roaster kind of thing and if you are lucky enough to get it off of it, the tacos are even more amazing. Those are personally my favorite, and I'm sure it is popular amongst other customers as well. They also have an adobada version of these in fries, you know, like carne asada fries, but with adobada, and I perosnally think it is way more delicious, and so if you like carne asada fries, I recommend trying the adobada fries.  Sometimes it can get a little hectic ordering from the counter and it might be a little complicated if you can't speak Spanish, but you should still be able to get away with ordering still. The dining area isn't too bad at all and once you take a bite of the food, you'll be enjoying yourself. Tacos can run about $2 each, which may be on the pricier side, but still delicious nonetheless.",

The al pastor was the most wonderful tasting thing of my whole trip to Vegas except it took 45 minutes to get through the al pastor line. The lengua was also tender as well.  Couple of things, the tacos were too good. You can also order flour tortilla tacos where the tortilla I think is warmed up first. It seems that you get more meat when you get flour tortillas. I also got the tostada, and it's not your normal tostada. It has deep fried tortillas holding all the contents together. I especially liked that those tortillas tasted sort of like corn nuts.

Also got a carne asada mulas, which was equally amazing.  I could've eaten two more of each they were so good.  The ordering system is indeed flawed, and I almost want to take a star away just because of that.  There is nothing that prevents someone from getting their food, eating it, and not paying.  If I were the owner or manager of the restaurant I would fix that immediately.  Furthermore, there are three separate lines that list various meats and types of food (mulas, quesadillas, sopes, tacos, etc.)  There really is no order whatsoever.  For instance, what if I want a carne asada mulas?  There are two signs in different lines.  Extremely confusing.  In the end though you get your food, and I bet you can order whatever you want in any of the lines.  The food is literally some of the best Mexican food I've ever had.  Next time I am in Las Vegas (or San Diego), I am returning.",

Rather than trying to offer everything under the sun, they do what they do and are truly masters of their craft.   They have highly skilled personnel at multiple stations, each carving or slicing a different beef or pork variation. The person tending each station is a master of their craft. They are the best authentic taco joint in Vegas.",

I had 2 al pastor, 1 cabeza (head beef), and 1 lengua (beef tongue). All the meats were excellent. The cook making the al pastor tacos oiled up the tortillas so they didn't stick to the paper whereas the one making the cabeza and lengua did not, making it hard to peel the taco off the paper it comes in.  Quite frankly I'd give it five stars if it was tad cheaper and the tortilla didn't stick to the paper wrapper. Plenty of strip mall parking. When I was there I was one of maybe 3 non-hispanics among 50+ people. Everyone was real nice.",

    "text": "Experience: Tacos el Gordo. Everyone in Vegas knows about tacos el Gordo. It's not your typical restaurant. For someone who is not used to real Mexican taco ordering process, it can be a little confusing.  There are lines for each type of meat/food items. You order from the person who is prepping the food fresh off the grill. After you have ordered, you take your food to the cashier after pumping your tray amongst everyone else who is eagerly waiting for their food. The restaurant is always always packed because of its popularity . I call it the Mexican DMV.   Food: The food is delicious! My favorite is the tacos al pastor which derives from the Middle East when migrants moved to Mexico. (Not a lot of people know this) the carne asada is really good. The food is always made fresh.  Technology optimization: The restaurant could use help with their technology and accepting payment options like Apple Pay and not charging for the payment method. The cash register is the same one that you can find at the public library. It's 2016 in America, let's move along Gordo!  Overall: Bring all your friends here! Highly recommend it and you can never go wrong with the food here! Yum!",

    "text": "Not sure what the hype is all about. This place is a dirty shithole, so they have captured some of the Tijuana vibe correctly.  My Tacos El Gordo experience took just about 50 minutes to get 3 soggy tacos for just under $7 dollars.  There are several lines that you need to be in to get particular items, then you need to get in to another unorganized line to pay. Oh and those lines, enjoy watching people cut in front of you making it more frustrating.   The food itself was average. Definitely not worth waiting for.  My freshly pressed tortillas were obliterated by the time I hit the checkout due to the amount of salsa the cook ladled on to each taco.   Now, to the actual tacos. The asada  was overshadowed by a handful of cilantro and onions, a full ladle of salsa and some green shit they represented as quacamole that was devoid of any palatability. The al pastor was pretty much the same. The chorizo taco was not too bad other than too much salsa and it gave me a rough gut. Most of the meat from the asada taco was gristly so I ended up pitching it in the trash along with the two other worthless tacos.  I can't really say the tortillas were anything special other than they are pressed there right in front of you. I do know after all the salsa that is dumped upon the tacos, and after about 5 minutes, the tortillas are useless as ingredient-holders, and you are left with a taco mess.  Pack a fork (and possibly your firearm and ccw), pay with cash and be prepared to wait a while if you venture out on the weekend. Otherwise, there are a few options right up the road that are less expensive and chaotic and you can actually enjoy the food.",

I was not familiar with a few things on the board, so he wanted me to try the tacos first, and then if I didn't like them, we had a second option to order something I know.   He ordered the Tacos and asked what else I would like as a second option. I asked for the quesadilla, and asked do they have chicken? The guy cutting the meat, gave me a mean look and bluntly said \"Does this look like El Pollo Loco? Where does it say Chicken?\" My boyfriend just defused the situation and just asked for some meat and we walked off to get our order. I was so embarrassed. I do not know why he had to come off so mean... Right there, I felt out of place. I just wanted to take our order and leave..

    "text": "Food is pretty solid, although the surrounding area is pretty ghetto.  There's a good reason a security guard is on the premise at all times!  They close at 2AM so come in for late night eats.  Sopas (Al Pastor) $4-Slightly above average- The Sopas here is 10x better than anything I've had in So Cal.  It's overflowing up w/ meat, covering the entire corn base.  It's also loaded w/ veggies, sauce, guac, and covered w/ a hard shell on top (I didn't care for the hard shell, I actually removed it when I ate it).  While expensive, I highly recommend it.  My only gripe was the Al Pastor was very sweet.  Sopas (Carne Asada) $4-Exceptional-Same as above, except the carne asada is cooked to perfection.  Tacos (Carne Asada) $2-Slightly above average.  Again, the tacos here are much better than what I've had in Cali.  The sauce on the tacos really give it a great taste.  I'm used to \"Cali\" tacos which only have onions & cilantro.  Carne asada here is pretty good.  Tacos (Al Pastor) $2-Average - Same as above, except the al pastor was way too sweet.  Carne Asada Fries $10 - Slightly above average- I think the fries are pretty good but nothing to write home about.  If you are sharing w/ a group of people I'd go for it, otherwise you are OK passing on it.  Tips: -Area is pretty ghetto at night, but there's a security guard there -Restaurant is pretty clean -The Carne Asada here is exceptional, but the al pastor is very sweet (but still good nonetheless)",

The tacos were fairly good and tasted authentic although I'm not really sure what authentic is but have had excellent Mexican food in California and Texas. My only problem with them were that they were small. I also tried their quesadillas, which is one of my favorite Mexican foods, but I wasn't crazy about the open face style, which seems to be typical at these authentic places and maybe because this is the authentic way of cooking them. I probably will go back and give Tacos El Gordo another try.",

    "text": "Okay, I hate to do it... but I have to bump Tacos El Gordo down a notch.  There are several reasons for this abrupt, unexpected change.  Notice that this is still a four-star establishment - I still love my beloved Tacos El Gordo - but now I have a few caveats.  1)The last two times I visited, there were men walking around the restaurant and trying to sell bootleg copies of new movie releases.  Beyond being illegal, it was just annoying.  They wouldn't take no for an answer and kept shoving copies of the movie Ted in my face while I was trying to eat.  I think it's pretty incredible that this goes on and no one seems to put a stop to it.  2)Once in a while, the meat in my tacos is downright cold.  From time to time, I get a taco that tastes just a bit funky and lukewarm.  Pretty unappetizing.  3)I'm beginning to agree with other posters (like Misti Y.).... the absence of rice and beans is very depressing.  Sometimes I get sick of just eating taco after taco.  And no, I really don't feel like eating gloppy fries with my tacos.  RICE AND BEANS!  That's what I want!  4)Los Tacos.  Los Tacos has ruined this place for me a bit.  To me, nothing can compare to my beloved LT.  Nothing.  Sorry, Tacos El Gordo.",

My only annoyance is the huge crowd and some of the element of ghetto people it attracts. The place is big with a few tables and outside tables, but it can get really noisy when trying to order food. Chilli fries are really good, and i like the fact that i can watch the employees cook and prepare the food. Great place, i hope to come back on a less crowded night.",

Interesting way to order, just go down the line until you hit the register with a tray full of food. Seriously great tacos and I'll make sure to always make the drive or taxi for this meal when I'm in town!",

I found this odd but what they do serve it very good.",

The place is setup almost exactly like the one in National City. The owner is real nice an we even had a chat with her while we were there.  If you've never been here before, Tacos El Gordo is basically like a taco stand and has TJ (Tijuana) style tacos-- small tacos but full of goony goodness!  My favorite is the adobada taco with an horchata and sometimes I'll have a carne asada taco as well. I usually don't venture outside of that because, well, everything else is made from things I prefer not to eat like intestine, \"cabeza\"... Uhm, yea, I love my choices lol.  Word to the weaklings to the spicy stuff, such as myself, always ask for no spicy sauce or \"NO CHILI POR FAVOR\" :) Their spicy stuff is pretty spicy for myself, I usually get the salsa verde on the side.  We'll be back, not sure how often since it's way on the other side of town :(",

Good thing we went in a group and we all split up once we knew what we each wanted. Someone was designated carne asada, another pastor and someone scouted for a table to sit because it was so full.

    "text": "Moving away from California had me longing for good authentic tacos. 9 months had passed and I couldn't find a decent taco spot in Vegas that made killer tacos that were similar to my grandmas. Then one drunken night, my boyfriend decided to take me here after we went clubbing.  Let's get one thing clear, this place isn't fancy by any means. Nor does it offer great decor BUT what you get here are authentic hand made tortillas, delicious flavorful salsas and quality meats. I had the Tacos al pastor with everything and added pineapple and practically swallowed them. I've been here a few times ever since and each time I've gone there's been a wait time of at least 15-20 mins to order food. The 3 separate lines make it pretty difficult to maneuver around when you have a tray full of food but it's nothing that's too bad or out of the ordinary.  Definitely my favorite spot for tacos and horchata!",

I forgot to get sauce so I went back in and I kinda looked like a lost puppy. this employee came up to me (I wish I got his name) asked if I needed anything and I was like \"can I have some sauce?\" So he told me to ask the guy at the window. I walked over to the window and within 2 seconds I turned around and he goes \"here ya go!\" with a handful of sauces. Mind you it was really busy in there. To me I notice the little things and this made me think wow they really care about their customers. Excellent customer service. Now to the food. I really really liked the tortilla they use. It was different. The meat was delicious and so was this sauce I believe it was salsa or something. If I could give this place 10 stars I would. Definitely coming back!!",

The reason why I knocked off a star was that we spent over $100 worth of food. The lady that serves the onion and jalapeno (wearing Nike hat) was so stingy with the onion and jalapeno!!! It was about a party of 10 so we definitely needed more than 4 plates. We love jalapeno and onion! the girl at the cashier clearly told us it was FREE. The lady that served it was giving us the worst fuchi face in the world because we wanted more. She even threatened to charge us as if it was coming out of her pocket! Come on we ordered so much food and she gives us that kind of service? Not cool.",

I was thinking about it for days after (I wish I was joking).    Just be prepared to be overwhelmed while you order.  They have separate lines depending on what type of meat you want to order.  The spicy pork line and carne asada lines are the longest.  The place was packed at 2pm...so I can't even imagine how busy it would be during the normal lunch or dinner hour.    I highly highly recommend this place if you want an amazing meal.  Can't wait to go back again!  Favorites: Spicy Pork Tacos, Quesadilla and fries",

    "text": "These tacos completely remind me of being in Michoacan, Mexico and enjoying some real home made food.   Although this locations is always busy, the sheer quality and flavor of these tacos keeps me coming back no matter what. Right when you walk in, the enticing smoky aroma of meat on grill hits you right in the nose reassuring you that you're in for a good food experience.   The first station you come across is the Al Pastor or adobada station. This is marinated shepherd style  pork meat cooked on a spit and sliced to order. This is actually very similar to shawarma. This meat is the perfect combination of sweet and salty. Neither one of the flavors overpowers the other and is paired wonderfully with some onions and cilantro. Don't just get these as the station next to this is my personal favorite.  The next station has all the little weird bits that completely. If you're a Bizarre Foods fan or pride yourself on being am adventurous foodie, you definitely want to stop by here. Ah yes, so, this station has beef tongue (to die for), tripas (beef intestines) which are very crunchy, cabeza (beef head), and this last one is my personal favorite buche (beef stomach). All of these meats are cooked to perfection and delicious to say the least. I would definitely recommend that everyone try all of these. I'm sure that these bits are something that not most have tried but, they are delicious. Writing this is making me hungry, lol, but on we go!  The final station is another favorite. Carne asada and chorizo (spicy Mexican sausage). These meats are grilled over actual charcoal which gives these meats  the authentic flavor you must have for these tacos. The indoor hood over the grill is fantastic as the dining area does not fill with smoke like other establishments I've visited. Here you can also get some grilled jalapenos and grilled green onions, perfect combo with anything they serve.  I've only mentioned tacos so far but they also do amazing carne asada fries and nachos,  campechana fries which allows you to choose 3 different types of meats, sopes, mulitas and quesadillas! All should be washed down with a horchata or jamaica which will really round out the experience.   Recommend this place? But of course!! As long as you're not in front of me that is lol!

They serve grease in all forms at this fine establishment -- glistening on the surface of shreds and slabs of quivering meats, whipped into a slime and drizzled atop grilled-flesh-covered french fries, plastered on walls and windows and employees' faces...you can even get your grease as a sort of lacquer coating on grilled onions and jalapenos! They serve ALL FOUR grease food groups here!  If you're an unhealthful, grease-lapping fatass, you'll dig it. But if you're a fitness-obsessed health nut who happens to be drunk and stumbling down the street at 3am, you'll like it too... shamefully enough.  The best thing here is the people watching. It's ALWAYS packed with an amazing assortment of Mexican families, couples, kids, chunties and cholos. Even at 3am, there are familias with little kids sitting around eating and laughing and bullshitting!   Since I find the food so abhorrent, I prefer to do my watching from the street, looking through the giant plate-glass windows at the hordes of obese people shoving greasy strips of meat into their greasy pieholes. It's like watching the Mexican version of Caligula, without all the Penthouse Pets.  On the plus side, the staff is VERY friendly, even to drunken gueras like me. But even that won't really get me to come back here...unless I happen to be stumblingly drunk and starving in the immediate vicinity. And I live right down the block....  D'OH!",

I'm from Florida we don't got much options here. and the Capechona fries were delicious, if it's 2 people just ask for a half size, it's still huge and half the price. after you order. ur food is ready within minutes. the. u make the line to pay and afterwards you sit down and enjoy some amazing tacos. it looks like it takes forever because of the amount of people but it moves pretty quick. definatly worth every second and penny!",

I'm going to open up with these are no doubt the best tacos I've eaten with no hesitation on that statement.  So why didn't I write a review sooner? Well I was on vacation and as much as I eat mexican food(almost every day) i do taco's maybe once a week. These taco's stood out in so many areas of how a taco should be put together. From the all star meat to the toppings. They don't leave you hanging here.  The first day I stood in the longest line in the place not knowing I was in the al pastor line with different meats having different stations until 5 minutes had passed. Too late I was committed and how could all those people be wrong? 2 taco's and a tostada later I'd happily stand in a line 5 times that long.  Next day, I went back. Normally I love adventuring and trying out new places and new foods when traveling, but I hadn't gave the carne asada a shot yet. Got 2 taco's and carne asada fries. The taco's were again a big hit. If you're like me and feel desire to check a place with great ratings, there's a reason for this one.",

I have had the tacos adobada and the carne asada tacos. Words cannot express how delicious the adobada tacos are. The description says \"spicy pork\" but I do not find the meat to be spicy at all. The pork comes off a huge piece of meat that is hung rotisserie style and then carved by hand onto a corn tortilla. This is topped with a green sauce and cilantro and pineapples (upon request). I don't know what is in this green sauce, but it is beyond delicious. I think the sauce and meat combination is out of this world. I really cannot up-talk it enough.   The tacos are slightly small, so I suggest ordering at least three.   You know a Mexican taco place is good when there are tons of Mexican people eating and working in the restaurant and Tacos El Gordo is no exception to that rule.",

I first tried going to their location on the strip near Wynn but after I parked my car and walked around in circles I was disappointed to find out they closed that location recently. Thank god they still have this one!  As I walked in, the place was not surprisingly packed. Each 'station' line was snaking. That will never deter me, even if it went out the door.  I stood in the offal line. You know the good stuff: tongue, cheek, tripe. After maybe 30 seconds, a smiley and guapa staff member came up to me in line and asked what I wanted. I told her what I wanted and she tells me \"no need to wait in line, let me go get your tacos\". Before she heads to the back she clears off a counter and makes a table for me (there were no tables available). Score.  Maybe it was because I was the only one somewhat dressed up (just a sport jacket), maybe she mistaken me for someone else. All I know is Te Amo Gordo Senorita.",

However, this isn't just a place you stop by for a quick bite, make time in your busy itinerary. The lines will be long, but so worth the wait!   We got 3 pastor, 2 chorizo and 1 asada. The pastor was definitely my favorite and  probably the best I've ever had. The meat was juicy with a slight tang and paired perfectly with the crispy and greasy, but not too greasy corn tortillas. The chorizo meat was tender and had that fresh off the grill taste. The asada was good too, but not much more.  Each taco costs $2, which in my opinion isn't too bad, considering you're inside with seating, although limited. Most taco trucks sell for about $1.",

You can watch it cooking as you wait! The meat is so succulent and perfectly marinated. The perfect meat is then topped with onion and cilantro as well as this delicious, spicy, avocado sauce. This is all you need in a taco. They don't skimp on any of the ingredients! If you're feeling extra cheesy, I would recommend a mulita or two!  The place isn't very organized, they have one line for the Al Pastor meat and a few other lines for the other meats. Of course, the Al Pastor line is always the longest. I've gone where the line pretty much goes around the entire restaurant!  I would truly recommend bringing your appetite here! By far my favorite taco place in Vegas!",

But, if you order a quesadilla, don't expect a regular quesadilla. It's instead the bottom of a quesadilla with a large corn ship filled with guacamole on top. They have more traditional quesadillas, but the name is escaping me.",

The deduction of 2 stars here is for the poor on-phone customer service and the wait. We had a large party and were hoping that we would have been able to make an order on the phone to come by and pick up. Unfortunately, after calling this location 5 times, we were never able to get a definite answer. 3 of those phone calls were picked up and hung up. So a few of us decided to just gather everyone's order and go. We chose this location because it is off the strip and we had hoped it would have had shorter lines so we can get in and out quick. But when we got there around 6:30 PM, the lines were extremely long and we were there for roughly about 45 minutes just to order and go. Granted we were ordering 70+ tacos and some extra, we still felt like the lines took quite a while for us to get just to the front. I personally don't know how much longer or shorter we would have waited if we were on the location at The Strip. But I have never had issues with waiting in lines for this long at that location. If anything, I always get in, order, sit down and eat, and get out in maybe even 20 minutes. Anyway, the waiting experience here threw us off. But the tacos were still great! Very tasty and a lot of flavor. Love the sauces. I personally enjoy the buche and lengua tacos! Still great to eat even after getting back from the club at 5 AM. I definitely recommend Tacos El Gordo. But just be wary of the location and wait times.",

Since there was only 2 of us, we decided to get carne asada tacos and al pastor. No onions and sauce on the side is how I order my tacos, otherwise you get a ton and very over powering onions and too much salsa to the point that you can't taste your meats. I've definitely had better street style tacos but TEG is a good option since my fave place is only located in Anaheim and Orange County area.   Divide and conquer...

But being a foodie I appreciate good food and especially when it's tacos. None of the staff ever seem to be overwhelmed with how many customers they have. It doesn't matter what the wait is you know you're going to get great food great service and overall it's just a fun experience. It's always extremely clean as they have employees Around the Clock cleaning up and putting everything in order. For as popular as they are, they should really consider expanding the location that's located on Charleston and Bruce. I love their tacos al pastor with everything on them...and i tell anyone that enjoys a good taco about this place.",

We were starving after visiting the Valley of Fire, and craving tacos, so decided to stop here. At first I wasn't sure exactly what to order since as an East Coaster this is not a style of taco that I'm used to, but we settled on the adobada, carne asada, buche, and the chorizo. I had NO idea what the buche was - it's pork stomach - and while it was my least favorite (so greasy), it was still good.   Everything was super good, although everything was a bit greasy. My favorite was the chorizo, followed by the the adobada. Tip for those who don't usually eat this type of taco: Let them put all the toppings they usually do on your tacos because it helps cut the grease a bit. This may be inauthentic but I think it helps immensely.   If we came again I would try the fries, since they looked amazing.   Lastly, pretty cheap - 8 tacos and a soda were less than $20.",

We came here last night and our carne asada fries was just okay and we realized that that might have been the last time we would be craving it for a while. Plus the price went up which was another bummer. But of course if you're here for the tacos, that's another story lol. Definitely go here for that taco craving!  Service was quick for us at 3am on a Friday night which was surprising but then a whole flurry of people came in just shortly after.

    "text": "In the world of street tacos, this is fine dining. If you come in expecting something other than a fresh slung, double-layered, mighty fine street taco, you may be disappointed, but then again, judging by all the reviews, ya probably won't be.   However, I will say on my first visit, I was disappointed. Why? Because I found the tortillas to have an odd taste. Is it a white girl tongue talking? Perhaps, but they seemed overly sour, and I generally love corn tortillas. I was going to sit on the review sidelines for the Gordo, but a hubby craving led me back.   On the first trip, I had not known to ask for the pineapple on my adobado taco, and thus, did not get it. This time, I was on a mission for the pineapple, a mission easily accomplished by simply asking, \"Can I please have some pineapple?\" This request made a big difference. Do not skip the pineapple as it is the secret to a complete flavor explosion! I think the adobado may be the best option, as the husband was not super impressed with the lengua. Plus, how can you resist a giant, red swirling cone of pork?   The resulting taco was a street taco win (not big, but flavorful), and the atmosphere is definitely like a street party. The place is generally always overflowing, and you have to head directly to your meat to place your order. Don't be shy! Everyone is very helpful and friendly. If you don't know what something is, just ask! Otherwise, you may end up with a brain or tongue taco. Yes, they roll legit with the meats.   The menu is limited, pretty much tacos ($2), carne asada fries and perhaps a quesadilla? There are no rice and beans, and you can call me names, but I love rice and beans and miss them sorely. There are no vegetables, except for a side of grilled scallions and peppers, which I have yet to effectively eat in a manner that contributes to my overall meal experience.  If you're looking for quick, street-style tacos with meats galore, this could be your place!",

You can choose from a variety of delicious meats - we tried the beef stomach and pork intestine unknowingly (the man behind the counter only told us what it was after we ate it). They were pretty delicious but I'm wimp when it comes to weird meat. I forget what else they have but we ended up picking al pastor and the chorizo - both delicious as well.  They topped the tacos off with different sauces and gave us a small cut of the pineapple that was roasting on their rotary grill on one of our tacos. :)  We tried some of the other stuff too (all delicious) but the tacos are the star of the restaurant.",

Nothing jumped out as being anything better than good Mexican fast food. The asada was particularly uninspired. I suspect that that the meat is cut into small pieces before being marinaded and cooked. This method sacrifices juiciness and flavor.  Of the remaining three, lengua was probably the best. It'd be nice to counter the fattiness with something more bracing.   In any event, Tacos El Gordo was fine. I'd go back. It's just nowhere near the level you'd expect from the median review, and nowhere near the best I've had in NY, CA, or even Chicago.",

It's disgusting and I am a guacamole lover. Try it on the side?  They do have a variety of different meats. I've tried the spicy pork, which I think they are famous for, and the carne asada but they have a bunch of other stuff. The spicy pork is SPICY, but different in a good way? I'd try it once, and go from there.  I like the vibe of the place and it feels super authentic. Definitely try it!",

Despite the communication issues (they speak Spanish, I English), the food I order is good and fresh!  I like the ordering process. You go and order your food from the front counter, where they have different people making carne, pork and other types of tacos, sopas and tostadas. You shimmie your way to the different sections to order the type of meat you want. I just point at what looks good and tell them I want everything on it. It usually turns out good for me, except for the fried  cow-guts taco I got. It looked like a tasty type of meat, but was a little fatty and too chewy for me!  I'll definetly go back for more. Perhaps once with a translator so I finally know what I'm ordering!",

    "text": "Tacos El Gordo changed my life.  Ah, I'm just kidding (kind of). But I went here late on a Sunday night because I had taken my good friend from out of town to Double Down Saloon and afterward we were both having those late night, been out too long drinking pains. He said directly to me: \"Take me somewhere that has crazy good, original Mexican food.\"  I immediately thought of Tacos El Gordo and it's perfect because it is about a 5 minute drive from my house. When we got there it wasn't too busy so  we were able to go straight up and order. Note that when you order you go to different people because they are all slicing different kinds of meat.  I went for the adobada, of course because I've seen all the great reviews of it. It was so good I ordered two, but then I went back and got another. The sauce on it has such a great taste and yes, you can get pineapples on it, but I do not like pineapples - so none for me!  My friend branched out, got an adobada taco, carne asada taco, and an adobada quesadilla. He gave me a taste of the quesadilla and it was just as good as the tacos.  I definitely will be back to try the other tacos. It's such an easy concept and for some reason I really like places that specialize in just a few things these days. It means they can really hone in on making something really delicious, rather than doing a bunch of mediocre stuff. It's just tacos here (and a few other things), but the TACOS are what you go for. I'm talking just real good tacos.",

I asked him for asada fries again and he gives me plain fries. At that point I just accepted it and went to pay with my parents. They ended up double charging my dad for our food. When my dad went to correct the issue, they lady said that it wasn't her fault. After about 5 minutes of argument, she caves and gives my dad the extra money he paid. The food is ok.

My favorite item was the Vampire on a tostada instead of a tortilla. In general, the tacos (pollo, carne asada, pastor), mulas, vampires, and quesadillas are excellent! The only item I wasn't too happy with was the taco de buche. I've had better and it's greasy. Some of you may not be pleased with the wait and having to battle for a seat. You'd be missing out if that's what is turns you away from this gem of a place. Overall I will take this over a buffet any day. Muy bueno ;)",

Needless to say, it was like the darn tacos were free! I saw a ton of people dressed up and I wondered if this was a pre and op clubbing spot to get grub at? Personally I wouldn't want to show up at the club smelling like onions but apparently tonight were the Latin Grammys. Here I though going to El Gordo was a new prom tradition but I hear it gets crowned at night regardless of the day. I can totally see that given the tacos are delish. Let's start with the Adobada or Al Pastor as I know them by are one of the most popular kind of tacos in Mexico. Right away you will see this huge trompo roasting with delish meat sliced right into a warm tortilla a \"Taquero\" artisan can prepare for you. I specially love how El Gordo serves them with a signature avocado crema sauce besides the all trimmings of onions, cilantro, salsa and if you're lucky and there's still some left, a slice of roasted pineapple usually dripping juices onto the meat at the top of the trompo.   There will be another line for different kinds of tacos. My favorite believe it or not are the beef tongue. The meat is not chewy and nasty as people would imagine. It's meat that's as soft as American BBQ brisket, falling apart tender. Try suadero, those are soft chopped meat and usually the 2nd most popular taco consumed in MX.   Finally, the 3rd lane is reserved for specialties to include sopes and chorizo. I don't particularly enjoy chorizo, I like  longaniza and this chorizo is a bit over condimented. Everything else deserves a 5 star. The tacos are on point!!!",

Its a bit out of the strip so I'll look a lot more ghetto, but it's well worth the trip. I was there for a Sunday dinner and boy was it packed. There is plenty of parking. There is a lot of booths and seats, but getting a open booth can be difficult when its busy. Another thing that I didn't like was how to order. There are three lines, but each line you can only order certain stuff. I hope they would change this up soon.  If you're looking for a burrito, tough luck. They don't have any here. I decided to try the carne asada fries to go with my tongue, beef and oyo tacos. The meats were fresh and very comparable to something I can get in LA and San Diego. The carne asada fries were really good. The portions were huge, and I liked how they cut the meat. Most places the meat is cut into really small pieces; however, they give prretty big pieces here.  The service here is pretty good. The people serving you are pretty friendly and the cashier was really helpful. I wish I could give this place 5 stars, but they really need to improve on how the food is ordered. Other than that, I really enjoyed my dinner here.",

It is incredible to watch how fast they will throw together your taxos, as if you were back in the old country South of the E.U.A.  I suggest the taxos al pastor myself.

Tacos are always good and good portions are always expected  especially  if you are a person that  appreciates good service and knows how to TIP adequately. Please  Tip these hardworking people  which are all probably  working for minimum wage.   When I come to tacos el gordo I always like to  order the carne asada  which come with  home made tortillas,  or any other variations  which come with processed  ones.  I had never tried TRIPA  tacos I thought  the idea of trying tripe tacos  was nasty,  my wife being a loving caring wife said try them and shoved one in my mouth and I won't lie to you  ever since that day  I order one or two  of those.  I've also tried the carne asada fries which are OK I suppose  but not for me I'd rather have a taco.   With all of this being  said,  I miss the location  on Vegas Blvd,  because it  is closer to  home and much  more convenient  that is the reason  I don't come as often as I'd like to. Mexican food always brings back childhood memories, as a child I loved going to the taco  truck with the family I guess this type of atmosphere  is what I like  sometimes (less the rudeness and loudness of some  macho acting Mexicans that  want to fight over a table.).  I guess you can't always  have everything  in this life. Well about to eat me some food food and enjoy good times with great friends,  til next time yelpers.",

I wish they could arrange things differently,  like having other people cooking the meats while the others serve or the traditional way,  have someone taking orders... I guess I have to give them another shot, but I dont recommend on going if your very hungry in a busy night,  you might get stuck behind someone ordering 20+tacos..",

Some of the items we ordered: Vampiro de asada- which is like the marriage of a taco and quesadilla with asada.  Mulas de asada- two tortillas stuffed with meat, cheese, guac salsa.  Tacos al pastor- pork tacos fucking to die for. If you aren't sure what to get, GET THESE! With everything on it. Comes with cilantro, onion and this creamy sauce.  Make sure to ask for grilled jalapeno and green onion it compliments the dishes.",

The same great service you'd get at the original Tacos El Gordo location on H Street. This place is bigger than the Palm Street location so that's a plus but oh man do they get packed here.   The Al Pastor/Adobada meat is juicy and tender. The special guacamole sauce is nice and creamy which goes great with their adobada.   I definitely recommend swinging by if you've never been or if you're just craving some tacos. Tacos El Gordo sets the standard higher than ever when it comes to Tacos and their Adobada Fries.",

I got sick and had gas after I ate here!! Idk I would rate this place at 4 the pastor isn't cooked like its suppose too I got really bad gas and the wait there is just awful!",

    "text": "When you think Vegas, tacos don't come to mind, right?  But they will in future trips if you go to Tacos El Gordo.  I can totally recommend the Al Pastor and the carne asada tacos. The al pastor is the best I've had in the U.S.  it's tender and very tasty. They serve it off the trompo which is a big deal to me because there are no taco shops in LA that do that. A few shops I've asked have told me that LA County doesn't let them do that. They have to thoroughly cook it after cutting it off the trompo and, in my opinion, that changes the flavor and tenderness of the meat.  The asada is al carbon which means it's grilled over charcoal.  Again, most shops in LA will cook their asada on a griddle.  Not the same flavor.   They do have other meats such as lengua, buche, tripas, suadero, and cabeza. I can't vouch for those because, while they're not bad, I wasn't too impressed by them.  Go ahead and try them though. You may like them more than I did but I just stick to al pastor and asada.   Give them a try the next time your in Vegas and in the mood for tacos.   There is a location on the strip but it's way too crowded. I always go the location on Charleston.   Enjoy.",

I really liked how the place was run. We nearly finished eating and noticed she had charged us for 11 tacos. (Kinda my bad for not noticing). The same cashier declined giving us a refund after much hesitation and finally offered we wanted dessert instead. That's fair but sorry to say, I would not return to the restaurant. I don't appreciate feeling like a dishonest customer. I don't want to pay for something I did not eat. Delicious tacos but sour customer service.",

We stopped at the spot on the strip and ended up at this location, hoping that the lines weren't as long. Unfortunately, the lines were just as long. However, they have a system in which there are three different lines and you order your food accordingly. Since I had gone in there by myself, I stood in line for Al Pastor and Adobada. I had ordered 4 tacos but after eating them, I wished I had ordered 4 more. They tasted like the ones I used to buy from the cart in front of my grandma's house in Mexico. Aside from the great taste, watching the guy at the counter prepare my tacos was just as beautiful. I had never seen someone prepare tacos that fast!   Don't let the lines intimidate you because they move pretty quickly and the $2.50 tacos are soooo worth it. Their creamy salsa verde has me looking for a reason to make the journey back down there soon :)",

If you love everything on your tacos this is the place bc they assume everyone does and so they make it that way! Kids weren't happy  It's open super late !  Cons: the ordering service is dumb. If you want 1 taco of asada and another of buche and then a quesadilla , you have to get in 3 different lines . Plus the line where you pay and get your drink !  They don't specify cheese for quesadilla . I guess they assume you like the cheese? We didn't ! It wasn't Monterey Jack .  The a/c is horrible !  No tijuana decor! I assumed pictures etc  Flies everywhere !!!! You would have thought we were eating outside . Nice serveral ladies bussing tables/ going around w a washcloth killing flies !!! $2.25 for one taco. Those California prices but in Vegas ! Really?   All In all. It was good . Would probably return , but not if there's a long line .",

The tacos are pretty pricey in comparison to what I am used to back in LA at $2+ a pop. The fries are $10 but plentiful and very much meant to be shared.   Green and red salsa can be obtained at the cashier counter.   The best thing about this place is the $1.40 drink for soda or mexican drinks.

Its also very spacious... And tortillas are handmade too!!",

I assumed the strip location would be crowded and the quality diluted (only an assumption) so we drove out to this location. Paulo pretty much nailed it, you know it's gonna be good when you are the only person here not speaking Spanish.   I don't like Mexican. I'll admit that right off the bat. But Tacos El Gordo is something entirely different. None of that heavy gross hangover feeling like other Mexican places. I have tried just about every taco and the spicy pork tacos are still my favorite. Each are about the size of your palm, and I always ask for more sauce.   They also have something I can't seem to find anywhere else....ORANGE ORGASM BANG BANG BANG RA TA TA. It's not really called that but they should. It comes out of a circulating fountain, foams at the top and brings all the boys to the yard.",

Note that each meat is separated into different lines so you have to wait in one line for carne asada, and one line for drinks Etc.  I think there are a total of three lines that they divide the meat into. So, if you're stuck in one line and want a different meet you actually have to go and wait for that line as well. It literally took us an hour to try four different Meats: carne asada chorizo adobada, and al pastor.  Was it good? Yes. Was it worth an hour wait? No. Was it a little bit overpriced? Yes, for the portions.  I'm not saying it was bad, 3 and 1/2 stars is above average, but to me I wouldn't drive out of my way to find this tacos Place, nor would I wait in line again for an hour. Sometimes the line stretches out the door.   Also there's hardly any seating.  I felt that the carne asada meat wasn't that flavorful or tender. Also, the chorizo wasn't that great. The winner here was the al pastor & adobada in my opinion hence the three and a half 1/2 Stars.",

Seemed like our group favorite was the al pastor.  Sliced to order, piled on with delicious goodness, and a perfect spice to sweet ratio.  Awesome.    Don't be afraid to try the unusual stuff like the cabeza, lengua, or tripa.  All good stuff and worth eating.    Super cheap eats and definitely worth a return visit if you're craving some tacos in Vegas.",

I suggest splitting your group up if you want things in different lines. I had the asada, al pastor and cabeza tacos!! The cabeza wasn't fatty at all and I was presently surprised. All were fantastic! I did NOT spot a salsa bar, the guys add their set salsa and whatnot at the counter. They do have red salsa at the counter where you pay, upon request. I wanna say the tortillas are made in house and I love that they don't get soggy. I ordered about 25 tacos to go and headed back to Planet Hollywood. I got stuck in some traffic being a Saturday night then I drove around for awhile to find a parking and THEN had to walk thru the shops to get to my room! But when I finally got into the tacos all were still warm and not soggy!!! The service was great too! The guys had nice attitudes considering how busy it was. The lines are long for a reason.. ppl who consider Taco Bell \"great Mexican food\" will say this place is overrated. Try it out!!!",

This place is in a sketchy part of LV near a tacos mexico... if you are from the LA area you know that if there is a Tacos Mexico, you in the hood. My friend and I walked in after a few drinks at a Yelp Elite event to find the place nearly empty. There was only one person in front of us at the carne asada taco line where I waited to get my chorizo quesadilla. The lady making the tortillas and giving out the chile's was rather nice and offered a smile while helping us.   After I went to the Pastor line and saw it looked kind of dry. I was rather surprised to find myself questioning how many hours that Pastor had been there. Mind you, I was slightly intoxicated which generally makes food taste freaking better!   Well, the food was pretty disappointing. Both the Chorizo and Pastor tasted dry! I even tried a piece of Pastor by itself and it was absolutely tasteless! Oh and and the Taquero forgot to put chile on my tacos! Ugh, I was very disappointed in my experience here and will stick to the one on the end of the strip.",

Here's the deal: There are two different windows for different types of orders, so be sure to read the signs. Everything came out really fast and fresh. The quesadilla was large and in charge, asada nice and smokey, and lengua was tonguetastic. Would've liked to have tried the vampiro, but they weren't slinging it at that time.

But I'm also leaving more of a 2 or 2.5 to be really honest. So the food, it's okay/good. The carne was good, the tripas tacos was actually my favorite (it's fried so it just tastes crunchy), the pastor was good, and the lengua was decent. You can tell the corn tortillas were homemade, but they are really only good when warm, when they're cold, it gets hard and it's socked in the oils so it's just not good after that point.  Okay the real reason I didn't enjoy this place. The system to get food is very different and to me ineffective. So there is a line outside the place, then there are 3 separate lines inside the place. The 3 lines in the place corresponded to what meat you wanted. So one line was just pastor and adobada. The other line was asada and things aside from tacos. The last line was like the ethnic meats like tripas, lengua, cesos, and such. So meat you want, you stand in that corresponding line. After you pick up all the stuff you want, you take your tray full across the room to pay. So this little system only works if you have 4 people with you, so one person to each line and then the other person finds a seat.  But let's say you're only 2 people and you want 3 kinds of meat. You're screwed.   So my boyfriend and I had that problem. I stood in one line, he stood in the other line, he was able to get to the 2nd line. But those tacos from the first line are getting cold and nasty as you wait in this long ass line for more tacos from another station. It's a very flawed system but only benefits the masses. Also my boyfriend finds it rude when people save seats and people with food are ready to sit down (and he has a point is it a little rude but it's the way it is over there).  Anyways, another thing that made me a little uncomfortable was that this place is very Spanish heavy. So it's hard for non Spanish speakers to order from here. Even the person giving instructions about the lines was in Spanish. So when I went to my line, the man either didn't understand me or I wasn't loud enough or he didn't care I don't know. I asked for some aspects to be omitted but he still put them on my Taco anyways. So I didn't get the tacos the way I wanted them to be. Total it probably took us almost 40 mins to get out tacos  This whole experience was just a mess and overhyped for me.  Would I come here again? Hell no sorry all",

    "text": "If you are looking for a good taco place, Tacos El Gordo is probably as good as your going to get in Vegas.    The restaurant is very simple, line up in assigned meat groups listed  above the counter, order, and pay for your meal at the checkout counter.  The most notable item is definitely the adobada which is basically al pastor or spiced pork on top of a corn tortilla with cilantro onions, with green or red sauce and another guac sauce that makes for a really delicious taco.    I always ask for pineapples which is cooked above the meat to give it a subtle sweat flavor which is grilled on the side and only given when requested.   You can also ask for grilled onions and chile's on the side which is also free.   The only thing that I would change at Tacos El Gordo is bring in fresh agua frescas instead of the generic soda machine versions which always taste artificial.    The food is great but the lines are not so expect a decent wait at all hours of the day.",

    "text": "This is one of my friend's favorite spot every time she comes to Vegas for work. It was a little overhyped for me. When you first come to restaurant there are 3 lines for different meats. You get in line with the meat you want and order then they make it on the spot. After you get all your food, you go to the register and tell the what you got and pay. Interesting paying process.  When it comes to tacos I have certain standards. For one, I'm not about the two corn tortillas so for that it gets docked a star. If it was a freshly pressed tortilla then you only need ONE. The other thing is that the ratio of meat needs to be good.   I got two al pastor tacos and two tripas. The tripas was good, a tad fatty tasting so I think if they fried it a little longer to crisp up a bit then that would be the shit. As for the al pastor, I did not like it that much. It gave me some dim sum vibes. The meat taste exactly like char siu, which is  Chinese BBQ pork. If I wanted char siu I'd go get dim sum. So this place did not really do it for me. My friends got the carne asada and they said they really liked it so if come back I will try that next time. The tacos are all around $2.40-ish so be prepared to pay ~$10 for 4 tacos.",

It's always full of patrons everytime we go there and everyone seem to be having a great time. The cost however, maybe a bit on the high side. For 8 small tacos and one drink has as spending 22 dollars.  Recommend this place but make sure you have enough to spend.",

They're a little pricey but let me tell you that they are worth every penny. My usual order consists of 3 Al Pastor tacos with everything, 2 tripa tacos extra crispy and some cebollas and chile. This location is one of the best since I have been to all of theirs. The location in Temecula, CA is the worse! Re-cap. You cannot get better al pastor tacos anywhere especially in LV.

If you want different types of meat you have to stand in different lines and that's annoying when it is real busy, which it almost always is. But the food is sooo good. Mmmmmm. I would recommend something besides the carne asada because that is done everywhere. i had the lengua (tongue) and it was amazing. Writing this is making me hungry. I think I am going to go there for dinner.",

    "text": "(Unpublished piece I wrote for a magazine.)   One of Las Vegas' best kept secrets is sitting squarely on the Strip (with another location downtown). Known for the most delicious street tacos this side of Baja California, Tacos El Gordo has an almost cult-like following, and for good reason.  With favorites such as tacos al pastor, to tender lengua (beef tongue) and cabeza (beef head), Tacos el Gordo sells not only some of the most flavorful tacos, but the cheapest you can get for the quality. Despite their Strip location, tacos are between $2 - $2.25 each. Piled high with toppings and hand chopped meat, the tacos are finished with a drizzle of homemade salsas and served right off of the grill.   Although routinely very busy, the lines tend to be deceiving. Each chef on the line cooks up a different type of meat, with patrons lined up in front of whichever station they want their taco from. Somewhere near the middle, green onions and various whole peppers are grilled to buttery perfection. Motion for a plate of these - they come free with your meal.   If tacos aren't your style, Tacos el Gordo offers lengua and adobada fries, with meat cut straight off of a large spit. Topped with sour cream, cheese and guacamole, these fries can easily sustain a party of four. Although the menu is generally small, quesadillas, nopal (cactus) and tostadas are also available.  Before paying, fill up on fresh limes and radish slices to compliment the tacos, free of charge. Top off the meal with a glass of frothy, cold horchata. It is a life saver if you've consumed one too many grilled peppers halfway through your meal.   Trying to find a table may prove difficult during the lunch rush or late night. But don't despair, the tacos are well worth it, sitting down or standing up.",

I was very disappointed to find out after coming out of the XS that the location changed to somewhere far off strip. Finally when I had a car in Vegas, I took full advantage of it and drove over for a mid-afternoon snack. You definitely need to make the drive when you can to Tacos El Gordo. The Adobada fries are amazing!  The line system is kind of inconvenient. If you want Adobada/Al Pastor and Asada you have to wait in 2 different lines. If you want buche/lengua/tripa it's another line. So if you want a variety of meats, you could potentially be standing in 3 long lines. I recommend that you come with a group so you can split yourselves into each line. I wanted tripa tacos, but i decided against it because it meant I would have to wait an additional 30 minutes and I was on a time crunch.",

For some reason, it does not taste good to me. But the times I've tried lengua, which isn't that much. The 2 times I've actually really enjoyed lengua was from this place. SO GOOD.

Good thing my husband was with me and he stood in the other line. Which was the same wait time. & good luck getting a table inside. Ladies were being greedy with the tables and were allowing other people sit down even after they were done with their food. Best thing i ate were the mulas de carne asada. Tacos de al pastor were dry and paying so much for a taco i would expect more.. i would rather go to my local taco truck and eat way better tacos and cheaper!",

I dunno... luckily there was a few of us to split in line... but guess what... no one wants tripe tacos so that line is awesome short... by the time i finished eating my tacos.... my bf was bringing the pastor tacos and i got to do round two immediately! Ok anyways, you get in the line by taco meat... and then you go pay for them at another counter separately.... i really don't see what would stop a taco burglar from just getting in line... getting a bunch of tacos and then sitting down to eat them... but then again, you might get taco karma and only be subjected to gross tacos for the rest of your life or something.",

    "text": "Sorry but at best this place is a 2 maybe a 3 for food wise but the fact that the ordering process is so chaotic and unorganized my overall experience here was a 2 and that's because the taste of the pastor or abodaba tacos was pretty good but hands down and undeniably not even close to being worth the fact that everything else here was pretty weak! Maybe this place is booming like this because Vegas lacks other legit mexican places or taco spots. And to top it off the prices aren't the best for what you get we spent $30 at this place for tacos and got full but definitely wasn't satisfied with the meal at all. And the carne asada here taste bland and flavorless sorry but I'm an avid yelper and this place completely missed the mark for me definetly won't be coming back here again",

The first thing you'll see is a massive rotating tower of succulent pork.  Next to the pork is a friendly gentleman wielding a sword-sized knife.  They carve the meat into fresh tortillas while you order.   All the ingredients seem fresh and unprocessed.  If you're looking to get as fat as possible, get a half-order of \"campenchana fries.\"  If you're staying fit, just get a couple of tacos. I estimate them at around 250 calories each, and you'll feel extremely satisfied for $4.  Only reason I'm not giving 5 stars is because they don't really have a signature vegan/vegetarian selection to write home about.   Several of my friends are vegan/vegetarian, and that means I can't go here as often as I'd like, because there aren't any truly delicious options for them.  But I'm an omnivore and Tacos El Gordo is still the best taco joint I've ever been to!",

I did add an order of the mula (essentially a quesadilla with meat inside) and it was ok (~$4).  I wish the cheese they used was more flavorful.  Make sure to ask for grilled chiles, onions, and pineapples for your adobada tacos.  Also, someone suggested mula w/ flour tortillas tastes better than corn tortillas.  I will definitely be back.  Other important info: lines are crazy long and inconvenient because you have to get into different lines depending on what type of meat/cut you want, limited seating, pina colada fountain drink totally hit the spot, limited salsa offerings, did I mention the long lines and confusing ordering process?!",

The food was pretty dang good, the tortillas homemade, the green salsa had a perfect amount of kick.

It's not slap yo mama good, but it doesn't disappoint if you need a quick meal, or just something to settle you from a long night of drinking. Tacos are $2 and lines to get food are separated by whatever meat you want. This location isn't as busy as the strip location thankfully but it does get packed at certain times.

    "text": "Walking into this joint you might be a little overwhelmed at first (especially if you go when they're busy), but don't fret your pretty little head, you got this. The meats are ordered in different lines, so if you want to sample more than what's offered in one line it helps to have a friend to wait in another line for you. The advantage to this is that by streamlining the ordering and preparation process the lines do tend to filter through reasonably quickly so even if you go alone it shouldn't take terribly long.   The adobada is without a doubt my personal favorite, it's hard to go wrong with grilled pineapple and smokey & sweet seasoned meat but most of their tacos are delicious, well seasoned/sauced, and interesting. The tongue tacos are also quite good. Definitely get yourself some grilled green onions and peppers, which are yet another line but usually quite short.  Sit underneath the stuffed cow head for good luck or to contemplate cows and stuff while stuffing your face with cow...or pork...  Also had a guy mention this place while out at another restaurant with my boyfriend. The man claimed to be originally from Mexico and said that these tacos were the most authentic in town. I don't know the veracity of his claim, but sounds good.",

First, I don't eat guac and they put that #$%@ on everything, to much in my opinion, and it tasted like nothing. The carne asada fries were interesting, but, once again, too much guac.  My family enjoyed the guac though. I think I would come back if I was ever in mood for a taco in Vegas.",

    "text": "My sister said it best, \"If you love a restaurant and their amazing food, do not go to their bathroom.\"  Accurate AF!!!    We go out drinking, you know?  And then it pops up in brain.. \"mmm tacos.\"  Normally, my mom is making them and we just go home, but when my mom is too busy to do them, we go for this place.    They got it all!  Lengua, Buche, Tripas, cachete, Al Pastor, Adobada and of course Carne Asada. Al Pastor fries are the best! I get them with errything!!!  Pineapples too.   The only bad thing about this place is the bathroom!  Yuck!!!!!! I guess it's supposed to be a single person bathroom because they have a toilet and a stall, but it's all together... no divider, no door that when you peek in the crack, or look at the floor you can see the eyes or the feet of the pooper...  nothing!  And I'm pretty sure it only gets cleaned in the morning cuz by 5pm it looks horrible and unwelcoming.  Long story short: I was afraid to wash my hands.    Highly recommend taking whippes or moist towelettes or sanitizer. Maybe even a table cloth...  Another bad thing is the tables in between the long ass lines.  It's so uncomfortable having people just stare at you eating and hovering over your food.   Unless you're like me and I stare right back and chew with my mouth open on purpose till they stop looking at me!  The other bad thing about this place is the \"chusma\" who comes to eat here.  I don't mind people, I really don't, it's just the ones that go to short line (normally the Tripa) and then go ahead and order: Al Pastor, Carne Asada Fries, pineapples, cebollas, mulas, huaraches, tortas, aztecas, HBO Go, Netflix, horchata, tostadas for their entire family...  everything that line is not for!!! the business of course being nice, they go ahead and do it for them, but that's why people keep doing that shit.  If your signs says Tripas, only take trips orders!!!!! Not the entire menu!!!    Other than that I'd give this place 5 stars. The bathroom drops it to 4.   Anglos:  this place is safe!  They even have an armed security guard on patrol...  wait... now that I think about...  maybe that means it's not so safe....  Whatever, it's worth the risk....",

Service was friendly.  Tip jars are for the individuals.  Great cuz I wanted to make sure the man who made my tacos got his tip.  My order was neatly placed and wrapped for take out.  Upon removing the foil my tacos were still in tact and the foil cover didn't get them all messed up.  The parking lot is well lit.  I was hoping they had a drive thru.  It looked like maybe they did at one point.  The restaurant is also patrolled.  Anyhow, terrific tacos!!!  Yeah 4.5**** is about right.  Glad I got to try them!",

    "text": "PARKING Didn't look like it was a hassle for parking but what do I know, since we took an Uber here.  INTERIOR/ EXTERIOR Not too big of a restaurant but man, was it packed! Mm, the lines were long for every section. They have a system where you line up for the for meat you want to order. Unfortunately, because it is set up that way, it can either take longer for you for faster, depending on what combination of food you want. After you get what you want to eat, you go by to the cashier and pay up.  Outdoor tables have heater above for when it gets cold at night. Indoor is packed and the line is unrelenting.  MENU The last time I have been here, there was no pineapple! Luckily for me, this time, pineapple was available! I went for the Adobada and Al Pastor tacos along with the Mula, which was recommended by a fellow individual in line. Along with the Horchata, this order was way too much for me. As I finished three tacos, I was already full. However, everything was delicious and the pineapple leaves a refreshing sweetness on your palette.  Compared to the street tacos, these tacos are a little bigger and a little more expensive but it is worth swinging by when you are in Las Vegas or San Diego!  SERVICE Workers are nice and they are trying to work as fast as they can, but the lines and people keep coming.",

    "text": "Ask people where to go for the best tacos in town, and most of them will have one answer. After a long overdue return visit (of sorts), I have to concur.  Tacos El Gordo is a Tijuana import by way of California that's slinging some of the best street tacos around. I visited the Strip location once a couple years ago, but in comparison to some other taquerias, it's not as convenient for me to visit either that restaurant or the one here on Charleston. Not to mention the prices here, which are equal to if not higher than the others, with sales not ever appearing (at least to my eyes or ears). But if you want delicious tacos with all the proper fixings, and price isn't too big a concern, then choose these guys.  Like some of its close competitors do (or used to), Tacos El Gordo has a system where you order first, then pay last. The meats are divided by station, with asada taking up a huge grill to itself on the left, al pastor (adobada) occupying a vertical spit to the right, and the rest of the meats enjoying a bath or sauna in the center. You may have to line up 3 times (and you probably should), so it's nice to bring friends. Luckily, they work quickly enough that I was able to handle it myself during Monday lunch rush.  I tried all of the meats in taco form, and I will list them from best to worst (per my impression):  Asada ($2.25): I used to think Taco Tijuana had the best asada, but this is on par and perhaps even better. With the pico and guac, this beef is juicy, acidic, and just so freaking good even when it gets cold after you've been waiting in lines. It might be just a touch salty, but that's nothing a slice of radish or two can't take care of.  Al pastor ($2.25) was excellent, just a touch shy of my favorite (ever / in town). The dude actually waited for the vertical spit to turn to just the right spot to cut the caramelized meat. Make sure to get the pineapple, complimentary and available upon request. They're a must-have topping, and they lend the perfect sweetness even though these relatively large slices were a bit clunky.  Buche ($2.25), flavorful, tender pork stomach (not belly) served with red sauce. This is at least as good as what I used to consider my favorite buche in town, but I felt that I was able to taste more of the pork here.  Lengua ($2.40): I confused this with the cabeza at first, but this is definitely the superior head meat. This beef tongue was flavorful despite it being one of my last bites of the meal, and the green tomatillo sauce is the perfect acidic complement. it's certainly one of the better lengua tacos around town, and although it comes at a premium, the price is not _that_ much higher.  Suadero ($2.25): beef shoulder, served with red sauce. It's pretty salty and a little dry/tough, but the marinated flavor and meatiness make this a great option. As with other salty dishes, a bite of crunchy radish (available at a cart near the fountain drinks) helps to take away the edge enough.  Tripas ($2.25): crispy fried beef intestine w/ red sauce. It's definitely overly salty/intense. While it's serviceable, it's not one of the standouts here. There are at least two local taco places that have better tripas.  Cabeza ($2.25): cow head meat with tomatillo sauce. It's tender, and while the first bite was delicious, the rest of it fell flat as I've noticed cabeza sometimes does. Perhaps it was lacking some of the fatty, cartilaginous pieces that would make this a standout.  Cesos ($2.40): cow brain, served with tomatillo sauce. Subtle flavor that I could just detect. I know it should be soft, but this one was a little on the mushy side. This texture concern and the extra cost are why I'd say it's the least desirable meat here, but it's still worth a try if you have the stomach space.  For delicious Mexican street tacos, Tacos El Gordo really should be at the top of your list. Assuming I get a taco craving and don't wanna wait for special sales, this would be my first recommendation for tacos in general, and for asada and buche in particular. Choose this location if you're in the area or otherwise really wanna avoid Strip traffic.",

I've been to the one in SD, and just like the one in SD, they have separate lines for each type of taco meat to place your order. My wife and I waited in line for over an hour in SD, but luckily, we didn't have to wait too long this time.  I'm so happy that they have one here in Vegas; I grew up with Roberto's Tacos, but Tacos el Gordo is on top of the taco game.   The adobada is off the hook! They have a guy cleaving off the meat, and it just looks so fresh! The adobada tacos were so juicy and flavorful, best pork tacos I've had in my life! The green sauce also complements it very well. I'm not a huge fan of soft tacos (prefer the crunchiness of hard tacos), but the meat here was so good that I forgot I was biting into a soft tortilla. For some odd reason, I can do burritos but just not soft tacos haha. I also wish they served Spanish rice, because well, I just love rice haha. But fortunately, no rice nor beans at this joint. They do have fries and combination fries that I'm willing to try sometime.   Also had a couple of their asada, chorizo, and suadero (brisket) tacos, but the game changer was definitely the adobada. I will definitely be back for those!",

    "text": "Wow. As a Mexican man who grew up eating authentic Mexican food, tacos like these make you weak in the knees because tacos like these are RARE and you can only get this flavor in Mexico by eating from street vendors and I'm so happy that I finally tried this place in Vegas after having been to the original location in Tijuana, Mexico. These tacos are the REAL deal and are legit! Just expect to wait because the demand for these tacos during peak hours is crazy! The longest I have waited was about half an hour but I have read and heard of longer wait times! This location is off the Strip as it's my preferred location and away from all the hustle and bustle of Las Vegas. Anyway, let's get to the food!  I will start by saying that the adobada (al pastor) tacos are probably the best you will have this side of the states! The meat is on a \"trompo\" and cooked to perfection and tastes exactly like something from Tijuana. While these are not the best al pastor tacos I have ever had, this will probably be the best you'll ever have here in Vegas and perhaps this close to Mexico. The asada tacos are also incredible and have that charred taste that only authentic tacos can have not just on your taste buds but on your hands. It truly is a heavenly smell! Just know that if you plan on getting al pastor and asada, they have different lines for each taco type so make sure you're in the right line when you get there!  I will end this review by stating that these are the best tacos in Las Vegas and are 100% authentic and taste like something you would have in Tijuana. These are the real deal and I always come here when I'm in Vegas! They are the bomb and receive my highest recommendation!  PS- they even have a shuttle to get you on and off the strip if you want to come to this location! Definitely convenient and pretty cool!",

To everyone who says they waited an hour because they wanted something from all three lines, divide and conquer!  I'll be in the pastor line and my friend goes to the asada line, done!  If there are three of you, even better.  Still not my fave taco place in Vegas.  I do think that Tacos El Gordo is a bit overrated.

    "text": "Wow!  I just recently discovered Tijuana style tacos, and I am in love!  I have tried a few places now and enjoyed them all, but El Gordo's al pastor totally blew me away!  I'd recommend the al pastor tacos or mulas.  The meat is extremely tender and flavorful.  Really, the best pork I've ever had!  Mulas are a bit larger than the tacos, pretty much double.  Like a fully stuffed quesadilla, except they brown the cheese on the tortillas first.  If anyone had ever asked me if I wanted burned cheese on my quesadilla before, I'm sure I would have been confused and I would have declined the option.  But it is so amazing this way!  Give it a try.  I also had some carne asada tacos.  They were fine, but I've had some fantastic carne asada in my life and this didn't really compare.  I didn't try any of the more adventurous choices (tongue, tripe, etc), so I can't comment on those options.  We went on a Tuesday near lunchtime, and it was very busy.  There were a lot of emergency personnel that kept cutting in line in front of us (?), so it took at least 30 minutes for us to get through the food and cashier lines.  We weren't in a hurry so it didn't really matter.  I've heard there are often big lines at dinner time.    If you like tacos, try El Gordo!  If you like al pastor, try El Gordo!  If you like life, try El Gordo!  You're welcome.",

We ordered carne asada tacos,  brisket tacos, and carne asada fries, all were very good and great flavors..     walking in there are 3 lines, each side is for the specific meats you want. You order then wait for your food and then take your tray to the cashier and find a seat.. first time there and we'll definitely be back! East side tacos are the best and the place is very clean! I saw 3 ladies just constantly cleaning and very attentive, love that!",

There are three lines which you can order different types of meat. Be sure to have your friends stand in the other lines and order what you want. This will cut your wait time and you don't have to get back in line for the other options.   My favorite is their al pastor. However, they ran out at this location when we came, bummer! We ended up ordering a bunch of carne asada tacos, lengua tacos, cabeza tacos, half order of lengua fries, and carne asada fries. Don't forget to ask for their grilled peppers and onions at the counter!  It goes well with the tacos! They have salsa available at the register.   Overall, I will come here again. The food is always consistent and flavorful. Hopefully they will have the al pastor next time or else I'll be going back to the other location!",

Only thing for me is that I wish they had a sauce bar so we can personalize our spice level. Other than that, highly highlyyyy recommend!",

It was my first time coming here so it took me by surprise that they have two different lines depending on what type of meat you want. To me it seems like a hassle to make two lines if you want tacos de asada and then tacos de buche. It would be more convenient if you can order any meat at any line. It's also very interesting that once you are given your tacos you walk to another counter and then you have to pay there and you also get your drinks. A tip if you're going with more people is to have someone go look for a table while everyone orders because it gets full very fast.",

That line was not so long.They honestly need a better system because this does not work. It should be place your order, pay then pick up food.  Ok now that I explain on the ordering of the food goes, do I think it worth the wait? The answer is NO! I had better. The green salsa on the taco was ok, not hot or spicy at all. They ran out of the red salsa.  I would not stand in this line again. Not worth the hype.",

I'm partial to this location because it's not far from the strip, and while the lines can get long, you won't be left standing out in the sun like the two locations on the strip.  I come here for one thing and one thing only: the adobada that's cut fresh off a huge trompo. I've had many tacos all over, and some how I come back here. The adobada is juicy and has a great char. The tacos are pretty simple and are topped with onion, cilantro, a salsa and an avocado cream. I prefer the adobada fries which are fries topped with adobada, cheese, sour cream, and avocado cream.

From our hotel, my friend and I took an Uber to this location. When we arrived, it looked like a sketchy part of town. I was expecting to be around or near the strip. Oh well, it's always said that you'll find gems in undiscovered places.   When walking into the restaurant, you'll notice the cafeteria styled setup. You grab a tray and order your food items a la carte. The menu is displayed above the ordering stations. They had variety of different meats to add to your tacos, nachos, burritos, etc.They do have two sizes of their carne asada fries, which is not listed on their menu (small & large). If I didn't order a large, I would've gotten more tacos try. So, with that said, I ordered two buche tacos. A friend of mine got me hooked on buche meat and there's only a few places in the Bay Area that serve it.  The large order of carne asada fries had be very challenged. It was so delicious, but was hardly able to eat the whole order by myself. Composed of generous amounts of carne asada, fries, cheese, sour cream, and guacamole. I didn't give up, so I finished it. As for the buche tacos, very tender and flavorful. Topped with cilantro, onions, and green chile sauce.    Great eats and experience at Tacos El Gordo!",

Tried taco de buche (pork) and I'll be ordering more of that next time.  Got plain cheese quesadillas for the kids.  Loved the burnt cheese ends, but wish it was two pieces of tortilla laid flat rather than one piece folded in half.  Carne asada fries didn't disappoint but would have preferred nachos as an option.  A few things to note as I was a bit lost upon entering.  Grab your seats as the place can get packed.  Figure out what to order and make sure you get in the proper line based on the signage.  Pay at the cashier after you get your food and don't forget to ask for your salsa.  Good thing I can handle my Espanol, since we pretty much stuck out like a sore thumb.  One of the guys making our tacos was very nice and accommodating. Oh yeah and loved that there are free refills on orange bang, horchata and pina colada!",

All I can really tell you is get excited, you're about to eat some really good food from here. And if you're like me and you believe pork is the superior meat, get the pastor taco.

Every one of these tacos were delicious, bountiful, and better than any tacos I've eaten before.  Not to mention their beverage bar is awesome.  They serve a variety of Mexican drinks and soda, and it's free refills.  A place like this you would expect to be a dirty hole in the wall that you would have to get into through a secret passage and a password, but it's quite the opposite and very clean.  They have two old ladies sweeping the floors and clearing tables around the clock.  As soon as I was done she took my tray for me.  Great service great food, what more can you ask for?",

    "text": "2 Asian girls and 1 white guy...that was my first thought walking into the door of tacos el gordo. I've never felt so out of place before, as we were the only non Mexicans there, but everyone was super nice. The adobada guy even offered us a sample slice. It reminded me a little of Korean spicy pork. I went with an adobada taco, carne asada taco and chorizo sope. There was an assembly line with the first woman making tortillas by hand. The adobada was everything the yelpers said it was! Spicy, a bit of crispy, and not much fat. I definitely want to get adobada fries next time.  Carne asada was ok, but not my fav. It was thinly sliced vs chopped like most Mexican places. It was nice and tender with good flavor, which was ruined by the awful pasty guacamole it automatically was topped with. The guac was pretty damn bad.  Chorizo sope was good, the least greasy chorizo I've ever had with  Mexican white cheese melted on top. The texture was almost like a good mozzarella. I've had better sopes, BUT I've also had worse :) Neighborhood was way sketchy, but Tacos el gordo was very clean, they had 2 ladies there just bussing the tables so there's quick turn over. Parking lot was well lit so I felt pretty safe there. It was great Mexican but I probably would only go back if I was in the general area. We got stuck in traffic for electric Daisy so it was over a half hour drive from my side of town.",

After trying Los Gordos in Las Vegas, the tacos here in Chicago just don't measure up.  Freshly made tortillas are amazing.  The adobada is to die for.  Carne Asada is good.  If you're looking to try something different, try the Cabeza (so tender and delicious) or the Suadero (slow cooked Beef shoulder).  They give you grilled green onions and peppers with every order, which is a huge delicious plus.  I can't wait to be in Vegas again for these tacos!",

Don't be intimidated. If you don't know how to speak Spanish, I'm sure you won't even bother worrying about it since their menu is listed at the top and all you need to do is utter your best Latin impression lol  In my opinion, they got the best carne asada fries in the form of \"Adobada Fries\" found on their menu. They got the best authentic selection of Mexican food. You know its Mexican when El Gordos' parking has a small number of vacant spot than what Del Taco has on the other side lol.  Their $2.00 plate is good too! I haven't tried their Quesadillas yet but I will after this review. I will update you how that turn out for me.",

We know how to find the best tacos anywhere and have had them everywhere form the boarder to the middle of Nebraska but if they have them, we will find them. At Tacos El Gordo we found them indeed!  This place has two dollar tacos which is a price hard to beat anywhere on the strip. They are expanding their store so you MIGHT not have to stand outside, but with as busy as this place is, you probably will have to for a short time. They serve ALL kinds of delicious tacos ranging from if you are brave or just want the amazing NOT average taco. By that I mean you can have the cow brain or carne asada (beef) and anything in between. They add a slice of pineapple to it which seriously makes the tacos out of this world and your meal would not be complete without horchata served perfectly cold to you. On the side is fried onions and peppers and add their avocado sauce to anything and everything! Also, many times the best Mexican food must be found in, forgive me, more ghetto looking areas so you know it is legit or out of a taco truck. Here, it is so clean and they serve things so well!   I don't care what kind of food you love or where you generally like to eat, this is a MUST for you to try. Get your radishes, limes and napkins and get in line!",

    "text": "As a Mexican is my review the end all be all for a taco stand?  No, of course not, that's silly, my head is not THAT big.  But as a Mexican did I have higher expectations for this place?  Probably . . . yeah.  I may not love it as much as everyone else but by no means did I not like it.  Heck, if I had only tried the adobado (spicy pork) tacos I'd probably give it a five star.  While we're at it, the tripas (intestines) are pretty damn good as well and I definitely don't mind the tongue either.    What gets me though is the carne asada.  No matter how much toppings you have on your taco or whether you partake in those chiles, there's no escaping the fact that the meat is just pretty bland to me.  Every single time, whether in taco form or on top of the fries it just really doesn't do it for me.  And it's a huge disappointment because whenever I have tacos I always want one with carne asada.  While I'm complaining, the horchata has tasted pretty watered down to me whenever I had it, although the whipped orange is delicious.    This is an actual Mexican franchise and it should be commended for having body parts that turn the average person off.  Tongue, brains, intestines, you name it and they all range from good to great with the adobado being the star of this place.  The set up is a little weird for most people and thus causes everyone to think they have to start at the right side thus delaying my quest to get those delicious adobado tacos but once you get through the process is quick enough.   If you're adventurous enough, come on down and try those tacos you'll never see at a Taco Bell.  If you're not, well then I'd still choose their carne asada tacos over what they have at Taco Bell.",

    "text": "Yummy! I don't usually go for Mexican food but it was late, we were near Fremont Street Experience, and looking for some good cheap eats. The first thing you notice when you walk up to this place is the smell -- in a good way! Imagine the mouthwatering smell of a ton of roasting meat and spices wafting out into the parking lot preparing you for the tastiness inside.   They offer a bunch of different taco fillings with unusual meat cuts such as beef head (cabeza) and beef tongue (lengua), along with the more standard steak and pork, all for $2.00 each. We got the cabeza, lengua, asada, and adobada. They were all really good, especially the adobada. The meat was very tender, and the seasoning was extremely tasty.   We also tried out the fries, but I wouldn't recommend it if you're in a hurry because it takes them a while to make. It's probably better just order a few more tacos which you can get within minutes. But it did taste pretty good; it's got fries mixed in with a bunch of meat, cheese, guac, and sour cream. Definitely share with a friend because it is huge!",

So while we are waiting for the Asada, the Adobada is getting cold. Thank God we didn't want a different type of taco that was in the third line. We asked if the same red sauce that is on the Adobada is on the Asada, we were told it was. Then we get the tacos and walk over to yet another line, the Pay Line. Turns out they did not put the same red sauce on my tacos. They put on some chunky ass tomato stuff on top. I can't stand that stuff. NO WAY I was waiting in that line again so I didn't get to eat. My husband ate my tacos. I did however taste the Adobada taco, not bad but it's not worth all the praise this place gets.",

I had a Taco De Asada (steak), Taco De Buche (pork), Taco De Adobada (spicy pork), and half an order of Adobada Fries. The Asada was nothing too special; your normal asada from any mexican restaurant.  The Buche was labeled as pork, so I was surprised when I bit into nothing but pork INTESTINES! It was surprising, but I LOVE pork intestine. Extra plus for that pleasant surprise! =]  Finally, their Adobada is DELISH if you can handle a little bit of spicy. They cut it off a huge slow revolving chunk of pork, and serve it to you. YUM!  As for their service, as I walked in, the place was PACKED. The servers were helpful and made the food on the spot as we ordered. When we approached the cashier, you can get your fixing of sides (limes, etc). All the tables were taken when we paid, so my party and I looked around. A group left as they saw us waiting for a table, and a worker walked straight over to clean the table for us! That's faster service than any other restaurant I've seen (high class or fast food alike!).  I will definitely come back, but since I live on the southwest side of town, coming here was quite the journey. Of course, it was worth it! =]",

I do not think chicken was one. I'm glad I came to experience the food. However it's kinda pricey in my opinion for tacos. We got 6 tacos with guacamole and our bill was $15. Definitely not enough to make you full because they are so small. It was more of an appetizer. So if you plan to eat to get full be prepared to have at least 5 to 6 tacos for one person and pay almost $3 per taco. No burritos but they do have quesadillas and fries.   Ordering was a bit confusing at first. You order from the guys cooking the meat and pay at the counter afterwards. I'm not fluent in Spanish so it took me a sec to get my bearings and no one was trying to help me.   I would come back for a good Carne taco to grab a bite before dinner. But I'm not adventurous enough to try anything else on the menu besides the carnitas.",

We ended up eating the pork tacos in line... no napkins, no table, then they determine our order by counting the plates, and wax paper (that we didnt just toss in the trash lol)....  this place could easily use the fast food business process...

Specialty fries are around $10 and quesadillas are $4 with meat ($2 without). The sign is in Spanish and the workers speak Spanish and English so if you are not a native speaker like myself they can easily take care of you.   The tacos are small BUT they pack on the sauces and meat like no other! NOT TO MENTION GUAC IS INCLUDED!!! At least for the tacos de asada it was. And man did they give me a generous portion!

It's a marinated pork combined in spices and chiles, and Tacos El Gordo does it fantastically! It's cooked to perfection. You see them cut up the meat in front of you similar to how you'd see shawarmas prepared. Meat is full of flavor and moist.   I've also had the lengua and the carne asada. Carne asada is fine, it was slightly on the burnt side for me and the lengua was meh. I'd recommend getting the al pastor over anything else.  Next time I have got to try the mulas, which are like mini quesadillas sandwiching your taco of choice. I heard great things about it after I ordered.   TIP: Look at the signs and line up in the line with the al pastor tacos! That is where you order your al pastor. The signs tell you which line have which items. Follow that.",

    "text": "Wow! Some of the best Mexican style tacos that you can find. Straight out of Tijuana this Mexican gem serves all types of tacos from a variety of meats and delicacies (such as lengua, tripa, & cabeza). My favorite tacos are the adobada or asada! Sooooo good.   If you don't speak Spanish this place can be overwhelming but don't worry everyone is friendly and happy to help. My suggestion if you like cheese and meat, order the \"Mula Asada.\" You will NOT regret it, it's melted cheese with flour or corn tortilla and your choice of meat! Yum!  They also have a fountain drink machine with traditional  juices from Mexico, free refills!  Recommend this place 100%, sooooooooooo delicious!",

Second venture was much more fruitful - Thursday evening at 7:30.  Only one person ahead of us and the process was easy: you go to the line of the meat of your choice and place an order.  That's about it.  You pay at the counter to the right of the ordering area, where you can order beverages or desserts.  Now, the taste: I chose the carne asada fries because, well, carne asada fries.  Since the meat is fresh off a grill, it definitely has a lot more flavor.  And I can definitely see why - the carne asada was so tender.  I look forward to my next venture here. :)",

Fast service  I was able to order a chimichanga the way I like and a chicken quesadilla without the onions   Parking was easy, it wasn't loud and it's centrally located I recommend",

If you like lengua, or even if you've never had it, you have got to try it here! BF was never really a lengua fan, but he tried it again here and he's been converted! The most tender lengua I have ever had.  Cabeza is also super tender. Adobada of course is a must have. They even have sesos. I've been wanting to try it for ages, but no one sells in the CA anymore. Well I can finally say I tried cow brains, but I can't say I liked it. It had the texture of custard (what I kinda expected) but it left a faint irony taste in my mouth that I didn't care for. But don't get me wrong, I finished that bugger! I just didn't go for seconds. ;)  I also love how they automatically put the salsas on it for you. So there isn't another line at the salsa bar. They only have limes and radishes at the self serve bar.  Don't be shy if you don't speak Spanish! These people are super nice and everyone speaks perfect English. If you have any question about what is what, just ask. When I ordered the sesos, they guy was like \"Are you sure? It's brains!\"   FYI the longest line will also be the Adobada line. That's the first one to the right. Get in line, grab a tray when you get to the front, order your adobada, and then go down the line for the rest of the stuff. Don't forget to ask for your free grilled green onions and chiles too!",

This place is extremely extremely extremely busy!!!! There are 3 separate lines depending the type of meat you want. I got in line about 4:30pm and walked out the door with my food at 5:15 which was 45 minutes. My favorite is pastor so that's what I got.  They trim the meat right in front of you and you have the option to let them know exactly what you want on them. I got cilantro, onions, and sauce and they were delicious. I really mean DELICIOUS!!! The tortillas tasted so fresh like they had been just made today. They give you a fair amount of meat so I was full after 4 tacos which were the typical size \"street tacos\".  Service was okay and difficult to find a place to sit if you wanted to dine in. Although it was a long time standing in line, the people making the tacos are extremely fast and thorough however it's just crowded. Hats off to the cooks!   I will be returning again as these tacos were A1 and will continue to make that sacrifice  (my time), to get some more of those yummy tacos. So I highly recommend to give them a try if you have the patience to wait.",

The adobadas tacos are definitely the way to go! asada and chorizo were just meh in my opinion. The asada I had was flavorless and burnt and the chorizo just lacked in flavor. But the adobadas... delicious, moist and bursting with flavor. We stopped by once more on a Sunday, before we left Vegas to load on up tacos for the road trip back home. Sunday was packed wall to wall with people. We split up so we can each wait in a line for tacos... there are 3 separate lines you fall in depending on what kind of meat you'd like in your taco. Managed to get in and out in about 20 minutes. Gordo tacos for the drive home was an awesome idea!",

This place is not the most fanciest looking place... but they do a darn good job keeping the place constantly clean.   HONESTLY... the employees look angry & mean... but they are freaken NICE!! they just literally have no time to smile because they are cooking & taking orders at the same time... plus never having a moment to breathe w/ all the people they see in front of them! *bravo bravo * but once it slows down they all start to relax & smile... especially the third time you order from them...   Three different lines to order your food based on what you want. I went around 1 am on a Sunday night & the lines were to the end of the booths. Everything here is made from SCRATCH!! Everything is well priced *as in cheap!* Pretty much the ingredients are all basic & similar... just simple goodness...  TACO DE LENGUA $2 - the most TENDER cow tongue that I have put on my toungue Hahaaha just melts into your mouth. Served on 2 small corn tortilla w/ salsa verde & chopped onions.  TACO DE ADOBADA $2.25 - perfect amount of spicyness on corn tortilla  accommodated w/ cilantro sauce, red sauce, & onions. You can also asked for grilled pineapples.   TACO DE ASADA $2 - the beef was not as tender as I would normally like it but still good! Topped w/ salsa & smashed avocado   CORN MULA W/ ADOBADA $4 - corn tortilla sandwich in a sense & adobada is the same thing as al pastor (something new I just learned)  =P    FLOUR MULA W/ ADOBADA $4 - much PREFERRED the flour tortilla for the mulas. Such soft chest goodness especially when you watch them press the dough right in front of your face & then cook it on the flat top topped w/ cheese on each tortilla. PLUS I added avocado ... OMG de-ri-cious!!  SOPES W/ ASADA $4 - thick DOUGHY texture hand made corn tortilla  on the bottom w/ crispy corn tortilla on top & asada, avocado, & salsa in between.   TOSTADA W/ AL PASTOR $2 - CRUNCHY goodness!! 2 crispy tortillas filled w/ al pastor, cilantro sauce, & red sauce.",

Some include tripe (pork stomach), lingua (beef tongue), and sesos (beef brains). I tired the stomach and tongue and it was delicious but if you aren't as adventurous the spicy pork and steak are more mild. Very long line and crowded but well worth the wait!",

    "text": "Good tacos and an indirect marriage proposal - one of of which I expected from Tacos El Gordo, the other...not so much. But hey, it's this sort of charm and casual atmosphere that I love in a place.  Having bookmarked this place for months, it took an entourage for me to have the guts to step in - of which, my brother, my friend, and two Spanish-speaking coworkers were all necessary. At first, I was a bit confused. But read the signs, get in line for whatever meat your stomach desires, and walk towards the counter. It's easy enough, especially when the guys making your tacos are some of the friendliest people (I may be biased after my coworker told me that one was smitten with me).  My brother and I do what we do best: divide and conquer. I grabbed a carne asada and adobada taco while he grabbed cabeza and lengua. At two dollars a taco, these are  completely worth the inflated price - brimming with meat and topped with various sauces. Plus, the tortillas are housemade...that's impressive in it of itself. Add a cup of horchata and our total came out to about ten dollars. These tacos are, in short, legit. Our favorites were the cabeza and lengua, but to be honest, I couldn't really distinguish the two by either taste or texture. Tasty has no distinction in my book. The adobada was especially delicious with a slice of grilled pineapple (be sure to ask for it!). But the let down was the carne asada, which was too plain for our liking.   If marriage to the adobada man means more delicious tacos at my convenience, I may consider it. In fact, since these are some of the best tacos in the Valley, I accept your offer sir!",

    "text": "This place has been set up for organized chaos. There were 3 lines. Each one was for a specific type of meat. The line for the al pastor was the longest of the three.  The man was amazingly quick.  Made the tortillas warm, carved off some meat, scooped some onions, salsa and a guacamole crema. My sister was in line for the lengua. This server was just as quick and efficient. After getting our tacos, paid and got seated at one of the few empty seats. Started with the lengua. The lengua was not tough at all. Melt in your mouth amazing. The tortillas were full of flavor and the salsa was a perfect match.  Then went on to the al pastor. The flavor of the meat was great. The meat was tender and the sauces made it even better. The tortillas was dunked in the juices from the al pastor. Had this meal at 12:30am and I was already full but it was so worth it. I heard that the one near the Wynn always had a line for the lengua and the shorter lines were for the other meats. The location is a bit far off since it is in downtown but it is worth the drive. Definitely going to try to come back. Puts LA taco trucks to shame.",

What a fantastic find! The bf & I came here based on other yelp reviews & it proved as delicious as people claimed. The tacos are stuffed w/meat which makes the price very reasonable. I had the carne asada tacos & the bf had the chorizo tacos. My only regret is not being able to put away more of these in one sitting.   Two words of advice for those coming for the first time: (1) there are 3 different lines depending on the meats you want so pay attention to where you're standing & (2) try to go during off hours because the lines get long & confusing otherwise.",

    "text": "After hearing so many good reviews about this place I decided to make a trip towards downtown and check out these tacos.   This place is a Tijuana based chain so I knew this place was going to be authentic. As you first walk in you immediately see the boiling baths of meat and the rotating pork stack for the tacos al pastor. This place reminded me of my early days of partying in Tijuana and finding taco vendors on the street.    The ordering system was a little confusing but the guys behind the counter were helpful to clear up the confusion. Each station has designated meats to choose from so you line up behind the station of your choice of meat. Me being the adventurous eater we decided on three meats, Cabeza (cow head), Lengua (cow tongue), and Tripas (tripe). Each taco is served on freshly made corn tortillas with cilantro, onions and salsa.   The cabeza and the legua were cooked to perfection, so tender they melt in your mouth. My favorite was the Tripas which were deep fried which gave it a rich fatty taste. MMMMMM soooo goooood!! I had a total of four tacos but could of went for more.   Tacos El Gordo is one of the best taco spots here in Vegas. So if you ever find yourself downtown or looking for some good grub after a late night of drinking head over to Tacos El Gordo for some authentic Mexican street tacos.",

I took one bite from the beef taco and I swear this was not beef but the most disgusting taste I have ever had. I promptly spit it out.

So when I first arrived I was a little confused but caught on a little after. So it is a small place and there are 4 lines. 3 are for the different meat types. So you basically stand in each line if you want something from each. You can however order the other stuff from any of the lines as long as it's not meat. You have to try everything I think. After you get your order you then go to the cash register where they ring you up. It moves along pretty quickly so it's not too bad. The quesadillas are a must!! They are a very small tortilla so you may want a couple of orders. The tortillas are amazingly good and the cheese......if I had to describe it I would say it was an EXPLOSION of flavor in my mouth!! If you can't tell the quesadillas were my favorite. Everything needs to be tried At least once! Highly recommend to anyone right After a long night of partying or to the person who loves greasy, delicious food!",

I also loved the horchata (the rice milk drink) and it was the best I ever had.  If your going to Las Vegas I would make sure to give this place a try.",

    "text": "There was a lot of confusion upon walking in.  I'm not sure if anyone ever mentioned that in a review.  Not in one that I had read anyway.  I didn't know what line to get in, how to learn Spanish in one minute, or what I wanted from all of the delicious choices.  I ended up figuring it out and I have to say, this was the best Adobada I've ever had.  Not that I've had a lot of it but this takes the cake.    We also had the Chorizo and the Carne Asada fries.  The Chorizo was a little disappointing but after that Adobada with the Pineapple, it didn't really matter.  The service at this place is fast.  They know what they're doing at all of their prospective stations and it shows.  I have wanted to hit this place up for a long time and I finally convinced my wife on one of our Staff days at work.  The food is awesome!",

We got a sample of each, spicy beef, pork and beef on soft taco. All made to order with fresh ingredient, including the soft taco where they stamp them as needed. Don't forget to try the different meat such as the beef tongue, they looked good. They probably got some of the best tacos this side of Tijuana.",

    "text": "I've been a huge fan of Tacos El Gordo...  When I heard they've moved from their old location, I was devastated!! Now that I'm here for the first time at their new location, here's a few things I've learned during my visit....  1) their crazy ordering line is still in place. Try opting to try some crazier stuff like their head, tongue or even tripe. There is absolutely no line for this window  2) grab a buddy. The more the merrier. Split up and grab a buddy for the carne asada line, their adobada line, and a SEAT!  They've increased their seating but people seem to be grabbing them fast so it's best if you have a body to secure one  3) don't be rude. Don't be that guy trying to cut in line. People will cuss you out. (I've seen it happen) lol  4) a lot more somewhat organized than the old location...in a weird way. I remember at the old location it was kind of a free for all and people were just yelling out orders but it seems a lot more tamed this time around...  New location, same taste!! Still delivering some of the best tacos I've eaten!! Never disappointed when I come! Just wish you guys were closer to the strip like before!",

And even though lines are long, they're super fast and efficient so it doesn't take too long! I forget the pricing but I don't remember it being too terrible or anything.

The quesadillas are the exact same size as the small tacos, only difference that they put a little piece of cheese on it.   3. There is a long line for each type of meat, which is absolutely ridiculous, as everybody more than likely will be ordering 2 different meats every time. Wait time is approximately 45 minutes.   4. By the time you receive your tacos, you are waiting for the other meats, and finally pay, your tacos are already cold.   5. Dining in is a challenge as there as like only 5 tables inside. We were lucky to get a table, but it's super uncomfortable eating when there are a bunch of standing hungry people waiting in line next to you.   6. This is my first and my last time coming here. I would definitely opt for going to \"El Tizon\" as they actually make burritos there.",

I wanted to add to my order after ordering and he simply declined me. I literally waited 40 minutes plus and you can't add 3 more tacos to my order?! Ridiculous. I ordered the pastor and it didn't even come with pineapples. I'm upset at the fact that other people in the line I was in was able to order different assortment of meat choices but when it was my turn he declined me!!! Are u serious ?!!!? I really don't get the hype of taco el gordo either, it isn't that great. I would choose any taco truck over this place any day.

It isn't too far from the strip so if you have a car, please do bother to take the drive down here. If not, you are definitely missing out!  Warning: you will leave smelling like tacos so don't come in after a fresh shower... Also your fingers will have the taco scent lingering for like the next 7 hours.   The menu is priced at $2 or $2.50 per taco depending on what you order. You grab a tray, go, and order. On a normal hungry day, I can eat about 7-8 tacos.   I highly recommend ordering the adobada (aka \"spicy pork\" -- not really that spicy at all, actually) and ask for pineapples on the side. I eat it with the pineapple and it is sooooo good! I do this by ripping pieces of pineapple and just dropping it on the taco lol. I've noticed if they see you add something to the tip jar, most of the time they'll add the pineapple & extras without you even asking ;)  In addition to that, the classic asada (steak) is always spot on! I've explored all the other tacos such as the lengua but it didn't tickle my fancy. Every time I come here, I now only get the adobada and asada.   The fries are also HUGE. We have shared the fries between 4 people while also eating some tacos. I also enjoy the quesadillas they make here!  I have been to Tacos el Gordo so many times.. And every single time I leave stuffed and satisfied. Yum!",

Finally 25 min later I got to sit to eat my tacos and oh boy I was disappointed with the taste absolutely no flavor from the meat to the salsa .It taste like water and the guacamole not sure what it was but it sure wasn't that .

So good and I wish there was one close to me back home. We will definitely stop by every time we are in Vegas. Only down fall to this place and the reason for not giving 5 stars is the seating.

Notice that big chunk of inverted curvy red meat rotating at a smooth, cool pace? She's with me. Her name is Adobada. She's pork cooking rotisserie style, beautifully marinated in a spicy 'red' chili sauce.. tossed on a corn tortilla, doused with hints sweet of cumin, a sprinkle of oregano, grilled onions and lathered with a creamy green salsa verde.  Ay dios mio! The perfect mixture of tender sweetness and spices that kick. Easily one of the best tacos I've had to date.  This isn't the only thing they serve, of course. What's neat is they have it set up almost like a cafeteria / buffet, in the sense that you can get in a line for an Adobada taco then walk over to another line and grab some carne asada fries.   Thirsty? From horchata & agua frescas to my favorite.. Orange Bang, Bang.. Baby. Like a mother and her child, the drinks and food go hand in hand. Then into my stomach. Not the mother and the child, the food, you sicko.  The staff is pleasant, usually smiling and constantly moving.. This place is well kept and presented in a welcoming manner.  It truly reminded me of a few taco joints back home in LA, and that's a great thing! Amazing food, fair prices, up-to-par service and an alright location. Tacos El Gordo has the Nevada taco game on lockdown!",

This is definitely a place where you can find and dash...I didn't! You first stand in a looooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooong line for the different types of meat you want (so if you want asada, adobada, and lengua this means three long ass lines) which makes no sense at all. Then you stand in another line to pay. Oh so tempted to not stand in line to pay but alas I am not a scammer.",

    "text": "The last stop on the Taco Trek for our group.  This place also has an al pastor wheel but I got a carne asada taco Azteca style which means it comes with a fresh grilled cactus pad.  I love cactus can this was super good!  Also, you can get at no extra charge, grilled vegetables to go with your taco.  When I saw it consisted of grilled scallions and two grilled peppers--one a jalapeno, I had to get the veggies.  The taco was very tasty and I ate the onions and peppers almost as a side dish.  Another thing different about El Gordo is that you can get either flour or corn tacos.  I got the corn this time and it was quite flavorful.  The tacos here are smaller than at the other places we stopped, but they are good and worth the price with the vegetable dish.  At $2, the place is on par with the other taco places in the area.  A little difference with this place is that you pick up a tray and place your ordered dishes on it.  Then you go to the cashier and pay for what you ordered.  It's very much cafeteria style.  Last night was quite busy and when our group arrived, we got a lot of stares.  A good stop of the Taco Trek!",

    "text": "Went to Tacos El Gordo tonight.  Anyone whose read any previous reviews know my wife and I are from Southern California so we are constantly on the look out for great Mexican food in Vegas like why you can find in So Cal.  Tonight we went to Tacos El Gordo (E Charleston location).  First you can spot this place pretty easily as the small building is bright pink in color.  When you go inside there is a giant counter, and depending on what part of the menu you are ordering from, you stand in a different line. This is good in theory but a little bit of a hassle, as my wife was looking for Tacos Al Pastor which had no line and I went for Carne Asada which had several people waiting.  The meat is cooked and cut fresh in front of you, and the tacos are slapped together quickly.  I also ordered the carne asada fries.  Once you get your food, you go to a different counter and pay.  Pros:  VERY tasty food made fresh and for the tacos they are not terribly expensive (around 2 bucks each).  The asada fries stood out for me here tho.  Freshly fried fries topped with a moderate amount of carne asada, then topped with shredded cheese, sour cream, cilantro lime sauce and fresh guacamole.  You can order half or full and the full is massive.  They also have a full soda fountain as well as an BANG! Fountain which features my favorite Orange Bang!  Cons: very limited seating for such a busy place, the separate lines could leave your guest sitting with food getting cold while you wait and the asada fries take a bit to come out.   Higher price on some items, as the carne asada fries are $12 which in CA you would get the equivalent for about $8.50.  Overall good food in a town that considers places like Chipotle Mexican food, this place is the real deal.",

I like the straightforwardness about Tacos el Gordo. I appreciate that they keep it simple and flavorful.  My coworker told me to try asking for fresh avocados on my tacos and it was worth it.",

    "text": "Recommended both by Yelp and my Vegas junkie friends. The inside kinda looks like a Wendy's that serves tacos.  After discovering that the location on the Strip had closed down, we ventured to this branch on Charleston Boulevard, only to be met with the long lines nearly coming out the door. A couple of us scoped out a table, while the others waited in line. We decided to go for broke and order a little bit of everything, which meant waiting in each of the different lines, since each line served a different type of meat. The wait took about 20 minutes, but we were rewarded for our patience.  My favorite were the al pastor, cabeza, and carne asada tacos. The asada tacos had that delicious char that you get with grilling over the fire, which was awesome. The cabeza tacos were great too, albeit a bit on the fattier side. We got a few of the vampiros which were bomb as well. The horchata tasted freshly made and not too sweet. The crown jewel, though, was easily the carne asada fries. A bunch of shoestring fries, topped with cheese, carne asada, guac, and a variety of sauces. A huge portion for $10, and they don't skimp on the meat. So bomb. Comes with some grilled vegetables and different fixings, which are pretty tasty.  The service is relatively quick, the prices are cheap, and the food is very satisfying. Definitely will be back when I'm back in Vegas and hopefully not dead from being chased by loan sharks. Ha.",

We frequent the one in Chula Vista where there's always long lines for parking, food, and tables. This place has ample parking and plenty of tables. We were the only ones in line. The food tastes just as good here. The guy that made the tacos for us was really nice and hooked it up with a lot of pineapples. Minus one star for the cashier. She looked so lifeless. Didn't say much to us and was really stingy on the hot sauce.   This location rocks. It gets busy during certain hours but certainly not crazy. It's a couple of miles away from The Strip but it's great if you like to avoid the crowds.",

There was basically no room for you to walk around and the lines are long.  Make sure you read what sign for each line, because its different meat.  The best way is to have a least one other person so you can have multiple choices of meat.  If you ate by yourself you'll have to get in line twice :(. Anyways, we got the carne asada and al pastor.  I love the charcoal taste of the carne asada, but waitttt the al pastor was every better.  The al pastor with the sauce was perfect.  This is definitely one of the best tacos I've ever had.

Each one of them ordered in Spanish. When it was my turn, the first thing I asked was, \"Do you speak english?\" The guy looked at me, smiled and said \"Si!\" I know that sounds funny but whatever I ordered, he translated it to his fellow compadres that were putting the food together. Btw, im Filipino if you guys are wondering.  So for the food. All the reviews on here are pretty much spot on so here's my 2 pesos......I mean.......2 cents. I ordered 3 tacos. Spicy Pork, Carnitas, and Carne Asada. Usually my favorite is Carne Asada but these three I got were so good, it didnt matter which one I ate first or last. At 2 bucks a pop, thats a pretty decent price for a tasty meal thats filling.   The person at the next table ordered what looked to  be a nice sized Carne Asada Fries. I asked him how much it was. He said it was 5 bucks and it was the half size. (Que the record scratch). What? That's the half size? HOLY CRAP! (I wonder what that is in Spanish? LOL).   As I finished up, one of the ladies that works there came up to my table, looked at me and mumbled something in Spanish. I just looked at her and shrugged my shoulders. She pointed at my tray of garbage, picked it up, and put it away for me. When she walked by again I said \"Gracias!\" I should of just kept my mouth shut because she actually started talking to me. I was trying to think of how to tell her I dont speak Spanish. So without thinking it through, I said, \"No habla ingles!\". As soon as I saw the look on her face I realized I just told her that I dont speak english!   So in closing, you dont need to know Spanish to eat good food here. But in my case, it probably would of helped!",

    "text": "I can't believe I haven't written a review for this place yet! How is that possible, this is one of my SPOTS! Its possibly the best place to get tacos in las vegas. Ask anyone! I've probably go 2-3 times a month to this place simply because its the best. No one ever says no to el gordo... it will thwart any good dieting intentions, melt away your convictions but leaving you with no regret. just sweet satisfaction  It doesn't matter if you're new to Mexican food you're going to love it here...I am from Canada and had no IDEA what real mexican food was like. Definitely not a lot of authentic places at that latitude. But I instantly loved this place, and you will too! I recommend you try the The tacos adobada  or adobada fries... with everything on it... but MAKE SURE you ask for them to put PINEAPPLE on it. seriously its a game changer and if you don't ask for it specifically you wont get it.  If you get the fries, you may want to share it with someone.. even the 1/2 size order at $5 is crazy huge and shareable.   Also for something different to drink, try the orange whip fountain drink. Its a very rare drink to find in restaurants, so take advantage of it at El Gordo... it tastes like a creamsicle!",

    "text": "I was generous in rating this place four stars. Nevertheless I really do like the tacos and asada fries.   Bought 1 asada taco, 2 adobada tacos, 1 chorizo taco, and carne asada fries. Yes I do eat a lot so please excuse my endless appetite.  The tacos were delicious! Very well cooked and they pound it with guacamole, which I'm not used to since they don't do that in LA at your standard taco stand. But it's nice for a change. The adobada is practically the same as pastor.. Marinated pork. The sauces on the other hand were good but not great. Nothing too special but nothing beats spicing up that Mexican quench in your mouth!  The one thing I dislike about this place is the price. $2 for a single taco... and they charge you tax too, so technically even more than that. Maybe I'm just too used to $1 tacos from my hometown but that is pretty greedy of the Gordo management.  This is located in a pretty dead and shady neighborhood so be warned. I also kept getting stared at in which, I guess is cause I was the only Asian there. Asian or Mexican, it doesn't matter. I can eat more Mexican food than your everyday Hispanic person.",

I drive out from Henderson to eat at this place and I speak noo spanish but i sure as hell know a good street taco. I was raised in San Diego and spent many nights on the streets of TJ after hitting up the clubs.. This place is the closest you'll get without needing a passport to real mexican tacos. My belly says it all!! I can't stop at just one. If your a white and have no clue what they are chopping up behind the grill. Just ask any of the cooks and they will share a little piece of meat to try and explain what it is. I keep it simple to the carne asada and the slow cooked pork (abodabo) .",

    "text": "Always loud, crowded and can be intimidating. Ordering food here is different. Great place to take someone who will try anything. Kindly wait in line. It sometimes goes out the door. People behind the counter are always sweet and patient. Speak loudly and smile. After each thing you order they ask, \"with everything,\" and you will say, \"YES!\"  For your first time you must get the  1/2 order of adobada fries (not displayed on menu).  Order it at the right most part of the counter. You will have to wait a hot minute for these so grab a tray and promptly move left/down the counter to order other stuff. I love tongue tacos (lengua) and head tacos (cabeza). I usually get one of those with a mula of different meat. I prefer mulas with flour tortillas and tacos with corn. After you order stand back and wait attentively for your items. After your tray is complete take it to the cash register. Ask for a small drink and fill it with orange bang. You will need many napkins and a fork.  If you get fries you should share them. Get one item then share the fries ~or~ get a taco and a mula.",

There's one person cutting and serving the meats. Completely inefficient. It literally takes an hour to get your food if it's busy. Which I have never been there when it's not. The mulas are to die for though! The carne asada, cabeza, and lengue tacos are good, but the buche is amazing! So having to stand in line is definitely worth it, but aggravating none the less. And I'll definitely be back. Usually once a week. Yes, it's THAT good! Just wish it wasn't so aggravating standing in line forever and trying to get a table.",

Yes it looks sketchy, yes its right next to the wynn in a weird plaza, or on a not that nice of a part on charleston blvd, yes you will have to walk a little far if you are staying at caesars or mandalay , but it totally worth it. The adobada meat, the carne asada, mulas tacos, quesadillas(real ones) are the real deal; Full of flavor , and  authenticity.  Sometimes there might be a line but goes pretty fast.

I ordered:  1 Chorizo Taco - good, but not memorable. It lacked a punch. 1 Cabeza Taco - delicious taco and the green sauce was spicy. 3 Adobado Tacos - the texture was crunchy and the meat was flavorful. It wasn't spicy at all though unfortunately. I felt the meat could have been a bit more tender. When they serve you this meat, they cut it off the spinning rotisserie and crisp it up on a pan. I think the crisping on the pan part of it is unnecessary.   All in all, I'd definitely come again.",

From the minute you walk in you're transported back to Mexico. They have different counters to place your order. I tried the carne asada fries and they were AMAZING!! They have 2 options- the $5 and the $10 fries- they're they same thing it's just a difference of size. The fries have carne asada, guacamole, cheese (mountains of it!! :D) and this amazing green sauce which I couldn't quite figure it out.

In fact I was pretty shocked to find that it's a whole in the wall type of establishment in a not so nice part of town. Anyway the tacos were similarly dissapointing because I'm a carne asada lover and I did not love this carne asada. It had the taste of a backyard bbq grill, where I can taste the charcol if that makes sense?...ugh. The buche was okay the sope was overfried....the orchata was dispensed through one of those soda machines that taste nothing like orchata. I just wasnt very satisfied with my meal at all! OH the grilled onions were decent. I also didn't like the set up, it's kinda confusing. They have something that I guess is supposed to be different stations depending on what type of meat your ordering and it's not the most convenient. So if you want steak it's one station, if you want pork it's another, and another. I wasn't sure if I was supposed form a line at each or if I just slide down to the next....it's weird.",

There was Moms and Tia's who just got out of a quincenera, paisas outside bumping corridos peeling out in there old dropped on switches Chevys! But I'm from the hood of LA Highland Park to be exact so that's like going home for me! Anyway we stood in a long ass line, we got tacos de cabeza, Adobado and asada. The cabeza was on point really good!!! The Adobado was ok I think your paying for the show of el compa taquero cutting the meat of the spinning rack and dumping all that guacamole and chile on it and it makes you believe your in TJ show! It was just ok nothing spectacular or anything! The Asada was bad! The best part about that taco is the tortilla and the guacamole other than that it Taste dry like it was boiled asada... I've had asada 10 times better from one of our mediocre taco trucks in LA! So it was ok but nothing to drive way off the strip for! To be honest I'd rather go to Tacos Mexico by the stratosphere if they we're open That late.",

Of course I replied and we drove over to Tacos El Gordo and sat in the parking lot. We waited with several others till 9am when they opened their doors. (kinda sad but True!)  The place is clean and during our visit the staff was busy milling around cleaning an already spotless dining area. Restrooms were also well maintained which was a good sign!  Because of the early hour, the Pork Adoboda was not ready so we each ordered a chorizo & Carne Asada taco and waited for the pork to be ready.  The chorizo taco was ok, the corn tortilla, made fresh before your eyes, was soft and flavorful. The chorizo was soft but not so tasty. I tasted more of the salsa and guac then the meat filling. The chorizo taco was ok but I wouldn't order it again.  The carne asada taco was my least fave. They use the less desirable cuts of meat and the presence of connective tissue and other Non-meat parts was really kinda gross.  Thank god the pork tacos were ready. They were excellent. The pork was slightly sweet and spicy and the cool creamy green sauce and salsa they put on top complimented the meat perfectly. They were so good we ordered 2 more! You know the food is good when you eat in silence =) I would definitely return and order the Adoboda tacos. The place had brisk business at 9am so you know the place is awesome!",

At first it may seem like a regular ole taco stand but the magic is all in the way they cook the meat. It's cooked as you order. Slapped on the grille as you ask for it!  The best thing I ate, which is hard to choose cuz it was all so so good, was the pork adobada. It's just another version of al pastor. Oh my god! It so juicy and there is a flavor explosion on the tongue. I think I ordered one of everything. Tacos, mullitas, tostadas.... by the end I was so stuffed I could barely walk . Luckily when I walked in there wasn't much of a line but I hear wait times can be insane. Even then, totally worth it!  Bring cash!!! Makes paying easier.  Drinks are limited  Everyone was so nice too, the customer service was not lacking here!  A great place to indulge! Check it!",

The paper the tacos are wrapped in had more flavor than the meat itself. I've been to TJ and let me tell you there is no comparison. I can see why the locals gave this place five's . We drove around I did not see any other Mexican taco stands so I can see why the locals favor this place. What's with the guacamole it's so watery and the salsa had no flavor and the meat was cold and flavorless. Or maybe it's me being from LA we are spoiled with the variety of different Mexican taco stands. If you still decide to stop by and eat you've been warned good luck.  No es bueno...",

Pros:   * Super fast service * Employees are attentive and friendly * Plenty or free parking  * Ordering & Paying stations are separate   Cons:  * NO SALSA BAR!!!   * Only bar available has lime/rabanos in it   * Tacos are very small & overpriced * $7.50 for 3 little tacos... no worth it IMO * Meat didn't really have much flavor, if it wasn't for the salsa they add on topic it would've been bland.   I had 3 tacos, I was still VERY hungry!  Didn't feel like spending $15 for 6 tacos that weren't going to fill me up!    I won't be back, I'll keep trying different taco places when I visit Vegas again.    If any of you ever travel down southbound the 15 towards L.A., stop at \"Carnitas Uruapan\" in the city of Victorville, CA.   Now THAT is a real taco.    Double big tortillas, LOADED with meat, big salsa bar, and only $2.70 each!   You can thank me later.  I'm satisfied with just 1 taco... I get full with 2.",

I recommend you only come here with another person so you are able to decide a conqueror. I had the Asada tacos because those are amazing and the wife ordered el pastor and she thought they were awesome. I liked that they had an area with limes because that will make every taco so amazing. We arrived around 11 am and the line was long took about 25 minuets to order, when we left the lines were out the door probably a 45 minute wait, but so worth it. If you are in Vegas and want to eat some amazing tacos you really need to make some time for these. The wife and I highly recommend them! Enjoy!!!!

The asada was just okay, not bad, but the el pastor was so great that I ended up getting 5 more el pastors to go because they were so delicious! Highly highly recommend the el pastor at Tacos El Gordo.   They have lots of tables and chairs inside and outside but it does get super crowded. There is parking in front of the restaurant as well. At Tacos El Gordo, you order your food at the counters, there are counters for each kind of meat that you want. Then you go to the cash register and pay. Sit wherever you want. Great place to come! Just come you know you want to!",

The lines were long for 5pm, but there was advantage to that-- it gave me time to observe how other customers ordered. There are three lines depending on the type of meat you want, so if you have a party, you should split up. Grab a tray when you're in the front and ordering, and take your food to the cashier on the side. They accept cards.  I'm not sure where the sauces were, or if it's even available. They have long scallions (no forks) that you can possibly get from the middle (I'm not entirely sure, I had to ask another customer). I wasn't a fan of these--a little too slimy for me.   As for the food ordered, the asada was good and I'd recommend the lingua sopes. I was full after 3 items. The fries counter had at least 30 people in line so I didn't try that.   It is mesmerizing to watch the cooks do the motions of building each menu item so quickly. I'd come back again.",

I really think El Gordo has been a must visit staple of LV for many years now and that's not going to change anytime soon.   They don't do any phone orders so expect to come in and wait in line just like everyone else. Honestly this is the only taco place I'd be okay waiting an hour for. You won't find a better al pastor maybe other than in Mexico.   Tip: they offer plenty free grilled veggies/jalapeno so make sure to ask them.  This place is great if you're trying to ball on a budget, because all the tacos are super cheap $1-2 range.",

So if you want to try a variety of tacos you might have to go to all three lines and by the time you're done your tacos a probably cold. I tried the al pastor and tripa tacos that didn't have much flavor to them and personally wasn't impressed. (Especially for the al pastor tacos since that's supposedly their best). The lengua ones had tender meat and the asada ones were good (the come with hand made tortillas) other than that I wasn't really impressed and believe it's just hyped up.

They have 3 sauces, red, green and this avocado/ creams sauce I think. They have like limes and radish's on the side in a lil bar thing.   It's very clean and organized.

The first few times I went, the lines were long and everyone was waiting for a table but luckily we got one as soon as a few people left. I started going around 3-4 PM on Saturdays and there isn't a line and many tables are open so that's a plus!   There are three different lines, each depending on which meat you want so it might get tricky especially if some people have never been there. The cashier is on the side so once you get your food, you pay, then you can sit anywhere you like. They also have a little condiment bar for limes and radishes!  The best tacos in town - hands down. I only eat al pastor but it is extremely juicy and always made to perfection. I love their tortillas and the sauce they put on top of it.",

    "text": "I've been dying to get to Tacos El Gordo since I crossed the CA/NV Stateline from Los Angeles. I just learned they have a few locations around town between the Strip and North Las Vegas. My family here in Vegas, originally from Chula Vista, CA, used to frequent their taco shop on the west side of CV which is currently located on 'H' St. These street tacos are DA BOMB!  As soon as I stepped into Tacos El Gordo, I suddenly felt as if I've transported to Tijuana B.C. (Baja California). Mariachi music, smoke from the sizzling carne asada, spatulas clanging against the hot grill, handmade corn tortillas, and the carving of the shawarma al pastor meat from the vertical rotisserie. My eyes instantly turned to red hearts!  Just look at the photos. Freshly made, straight from the grill, cheese quesadillas and carne asada tacos in street size form. Yes, they are tiny but pack a great flavor! The carne asada meat is fantastic - nicely marinated and finely chopped, sprinkled with cilantro, onion, guacamole, and tomato. Additionally, I like to squeeze fresh lime onto the asada and then top it off with the dark red salsa. Then there's the complimentary grilled green onion and jalapeno. All very good!  The Horchata is great! Nice notes of cinnamon and vanilla in this rice water drink. And there are free refills. I love it!  Make sure to read the menu board and fall into the appropriate line that is responsible for making Asada, Cabeza, or Adobada/Al pastor to place your order. Yes, you may want food from a different line so bring a buddy to avoid a delay. After you receive your food, walk over to the cashier to pay. Seems a little awkward. Just glad it wasn't crazy busy so I could still enjoy the tacos while they're hot!  Quality meat packed into quality handmade tortillas, topped off with fresh vegetables and excellent salsas, at ~$2.50 per taco, all make for a fantastic Taco Tuesday (or any day for that matter)!!",

    "text": "So torn about how to rate this place. On one hand, I have good memories of eating at the original (maybe?) in TJ and similar places in San Ysidro.  Anyways, you don't care about my memories. These are hands down some of the tasties tacos you will ever have. From the handmade tortillas created in front of you to the freshly grilled meat in front of you, you will get them hot and delicious mere moments after placing your order.  Why 3 stars? For one, I noticed the beef the chef was cooking was browning already. Now because the tacos are well done, I didn't mind eating them, but if I was at el mercado I would not have bought that particular beef. Also, the line is always ridiculously long. The last time I went 5 pm on Saturday, I waited about 40 minutes for my food. Honestly if I knew beforehand my food would take this long, I would have went to Tacos Mexicos down the street.  Also, the annoying thing about standing in certain lines for certain meats is just time consuming. What if I want beef and chicken? Two different long lines.",

Honestly though, I thought the tacos were whatever. Ordered the tripa, asada, lengua, and adobada. Adobada had a bit of spice to it but easily to overcome it. 2.20+ for each tacos seems pretty pricey to me. I've had $1 ones in the taco food trucks down the hood or around Lincoln Heights area that are more bomb and flavor-ble!  Overall, I thought it was overrated to me. Drove all the way from Hoover Dam to here for lunch after a long, exhausting walk in the heat. Luckily my friend and I came when the lines weren't too bad. Probably wouldn't go out my way to trying it again though.",

We waited close to 20 minutes in the Al Pastor line and then another 10 minutes because we asked for a steak taco from another station.   That being said, they're the most delicious, authentic Mexican street tacos in the valley in my opinion. You will absolutely not be disappointed by the product.   I'm a Vegas local but there appeared to be a lot of tourists in there. Not really sure how TEG got the word out (because I haven't seen them on a Food Network show or anything) but they definitely got it out!   I would encourage you give this place a try because the food is second to none but perhaps go during an off-peak hour so that you don't have to wait 30 minutes in line then another 5-8 minutes at the register just to get $9 in tacos.   But give it a shot!",

The meat choices include all the usual including tripas, which is one step closer to authentic than lengua, which lengua is pretty much as far as Roberto's goes.  The Mexican community really likes this restaurant so it must be good!  You usually have to wait in one line to order a certain kind of meat and then another line handles the more exotic items.  Usual stuff but the food is much better than Tacos Mexico.  I'm not much of a Mexfood fan so 3 stars is really generous and if you do like it than you may rate it higher.  It is still very delicious.",

    "text": "Breaking....my New Year's resolution. So this year's resolution was to eat healthier and to rid myself from any kind of addicted dependency but how can I do it when there's a f 'kng taco dealer in almost every corner here in Vegas? Specially tacos El Gordo where they can hook you up  with the purest and tastiest al pastor, asada , lengua and tripas tacos. So delicious and so addicting you would think that Walter White was actually doing all the cooking for you.  Service is great friendly and efficient, the place is also very clean there's always an employee going around picking up trays and cleaning tables since this place is always packed with taco junkies. Every time I feel the urge to move to Colorado I stop at tacos El Gordo to remind myself of a reason to stay in Vegas. I swear nothing could beat a rolled taco with cilantro at tacos El Gordo. I only wish they were open 24 hours since is usually at the very late hours of the night when I start getting all those taco withdrawals after consuming a few spirited beverages. They open late till 2am on weekdays and till 4 am weekends so make sure you leave the party or the club before that time so you can ingest some alcohol absorber. sometimes I get there late ( yes, I'm the one who knocks ) and end up looking for Roberto for an inferior fix. I have tried other places and this are the tastiest and best street style tacos in town by far for the price.  Take a break from that treadmill, throw those diet pills away and get yourself some antacids instead and drive to tacos El Gordo right now for some instant satisfaction. Why?  .....Because I say so!",

I really have nothing else to say. There are so many words that describe the greatness of this place but... I just can't. Speechless.   PRO TIP: The wait is pretty long so definitely expect a long line... Come with 3 or more people so that you guys can wait in the 3 separate lines. There are three different lines (stations) with different meats so if you come with more people, you guys can wait in separate lines and get more variety. That's pretty much all you have to know.

She kept saying things like, \"Adrienne, are you SURE it's THIS FAR??\" I just knew it was going to be THAT good. You can't imagine how delicious the adobada was when we ate tourist food for 3 days.   See pics of amazingness.  Tip well, drink the Horchata obviously, and try the weirdly addicting Creamsicle drink .",

Whenever an establishment has several hundred reviews, and averages 4.5 stars, you can bet that their shit is pretty good.  Tacos El Gordo doesn't disappoint.  There is nothing that I can write in my review that other Yelpers haven't already told you.  The food is fucking good.  It's fucking filling.  And it's fucking cheap.  That's like the Yelper dream trifecta.  So instead of sitting on your iPhone, go now, and thank me later.  Warning: I'm part Mexican.  Which means that I fit in well in this part of Las Vegas.  This is NOT your Las Vegas strip by the Bellagio type of crowd.  This is your recently immigrated type of crowd.  So if you're not comfortable amongst ethnic folks, then you might want to hit up the location on the strip.",

However the place alone is not nice when you walk in you feel like you have walked into an oven it's very hot and their cooking smoke is everywhere. I don't understand how people can sit and eat in those circumstance I have a toddler and I would not put her through that or myself. Now to the menu I order two quesadillas and they only have beef no chicken what's that about, and to top it off they are the oddest quesadilla instead of the quesadilla being folded it looked like a tostada except with a small flower tortilla and a tiny toasted tortilla on top. Their tacos were super small I normally eat two regular size corn tortillas but I had to get 8 just to get full since their tortillas were the size of my toddlers hand  . The prices are ok but they get you by ordering more because their food product it's small. The service was ok I wasn't wowed by it but it was fine.",

Trust me,Tacos El Gordo makes me one happy GRINGO! - And I am frequently the ONLY Gringo in the place when we are here!  Here is the deal- the food is super tasty. The Adobada tacos are my fave! It is spicy pork cooked \"gyro style\" shaved off one taco at a time! Was also introduced to a \"Mulas\" taco here.

The adobada ones are closest to the door so we decided to get some because there was no wait period & thats what we did wrong! By the time we sat down to eat them they were very cold because there was a long line to get the asada ones. It was about $20ish for 6 tacos, 1 mula, & a drink! :/ . . . Go next door instead!",

    "text": "I recently took a road trip to Ensenada, Mexico with five other \"Amigos\" for a bachelor party solely for either a good donkey show or the best street taco stands that we can find.  And by good fortune we  pinpointed the best Adobada Tacos during our taco stand-hopping.  Sooo much that we pigged out at this particular station 3 times during our short visit.    Fast forward to the other day the now, newly-wed guy (i don't know what they call them but he's married now and fucked for life) told me he discovered a place that has the most closest and most authentic Adobada Tacos similar to that stand in Encenada.  Heck yea!  So after a long night of work I cruised down Charleston just east of the strip and from that adventure alone i felt like i was back in Ensenada.  Grimy and full of blehhh with taco shop at every corner.    Once I've entered I was greeted by the first guy behind the counter, \"What's up my friend!?\" His attitude was so enthusiastic that I felt welcome in a surrounding that i wouldn't normally ventured alone in. I'm from an Asian decent and the only Spanish my amigo friends taught me are insults that you can only say to your.. friends.   1st counter-dood basically gave me the low down of how to order.  It's a bit confusing, but you'll first have to grab a red tray and choose your taco guy depending on what kind of meat you want.  There's actually 4 different taco guy you can order from, but seriously, you only want to talk to the first guy because he has what you're looking for. Adobada, son!    Adobada is pork that is slowly roasted with a red chili sauce, spices, and vinegar.  Kind of remind me of Char Siu (Chinese BBQ Pork) but without the sweetness.    You have a choice of corn (double) or flour tortilla.  He'll edge off a few slice or pork and dice them up for you on a flat, table fryer thingy and ask if you want everything on it (onions, cilantro, and avocado sauce).  I order 4 of those as well as a Chorizo Taco, and Beef Quesadilla loaded. All on corn tortilla except the Quesadilla on flour.   Payment would be best after you received your food, so you can get drinks and napkins.  They also have a side bar with radish and limes to accompany your tacos.  And lastly the 4th taco guy (usually a female) have grilled green onions and peppers to go along with your meal as well.  A squeeze of fresh lime over the taco and you've pretty much got the closest thing to Mexico's street taco's minus the hot sauce.  The Chorizo was surprising not oily like i've had before.  I would consider this authentic too.  Also the beef quesadilla was not bad either!  I love the cheese in the quesadilla!  I'm not claiming any expertise, but this is really good stuff.  My only other achievements are Roberto's, Amigo Tacos, and a few highly overrated, upper scale Mexican restaurant around town.  None worth mentioning.  Cliff:  Fuck donkeys.

Upon walking into the restaurant, the first thing you see is a huge meat pineapple. Seriously!   The line was pretty long but moved fairly fast. The place was PACKED! Luckily for us, the time we spent in line was spent talking to people around us to find out just what the heck we should order and what the heck the meat pinapple was.  The meat pineapple is pork on a vertical spit with pineapple on top so that the yummy juices drained down onto the meat. Through the other patrons, we found out that if we ordered the Tacos de Adobada we would get to partake of the meat pineapple. We were also advised to order 3, which seemed to be a sufficient amount since they are rather small. I did see several people go back for a second (or third) meal, so if you're hungry you might want to order more.   I can certainly see going back here as a tradition for our Vegas visits. The food is delicious, and definitely more \"authentic\" than we get in Nashville.",

    "text": "Unfortunatly I'm addicted to this place :-(   It's cheap, it's very filling and delicious. A small order of asada fries are only 5 bucks and we were unable to finish ( we did have two tacos before).  The adobada stands out... Have it with fries ( LOADED with cheese, sour cream, guacamole, PINEAPPLE) or in tacos, quesadillas, or mulas. Either way you can't go wrong with adobada.  Asada was the second best although I didn't enjoy the pico de gallo, it was weird on a taco, I usual have that with chips.....  I was not too fond of the greenish running guac salsa? Although everyone seemed to love it.  The chorizo was too dry and over cooked, although I might not be used to type ( seasoning) of chorizo.  They have a soda fountain so you can get as many refills they also have Mexican drinks such as horchata, jamaica and pineapple juices also unlimited fills and self serve. They have a lime and radishes bar but no salsas .. Which I thought was different. This place is more like caferia style dinning which was a hassle, being there for the first time and not knowing how to order sucked but I totally got over that since we were there the very next day.  As far as the location, it's not a really nice area nor is it fancy, It's open late but it's always full of people. If after 1am ur going to run into a lot of clubbers.. Most not sober. During the day this place if full of families.   I'm am contemplating going there right NOW!",

The carne asada fries were good and similar favors like the tacos, but instead of the garnish mentioned, it's topped with cheese. Can't go wrong, but I recommend sharing the fries. They had other tacos such as lengua, pastor, and cabeza, which I'll try next time. Ample parking outside, and we came on a Thursday night and no waiting in line.",

    "text": "There are a few Tacos el Gordo around town... stop now because this is THE one.  The \"trompo\" is always so hot and glistens with spices and herbs as it roasts by the flame, the \"pina\" on top is always succulent and sweet.  Yes, at times the line is out the door, but the wait is always worth it for the tacos al pastor.  You never buy enough as each neatly packaged taco slides down effortlessly.  It is a beautiful experience when washed down perfectly with a \"Mexican\" coke.  Hint*. Bring your own bottled Mexican coke, as it is not always available here*.  All in all, you may as well be on the streets of Mexico City / Chilangolandia / taco heaven when you enter this establishment.  The best usage of this building ever (looks to have been a 1980's Wendy's). 5 stars hands down, just a beautiful joint!",

    "text": "I walked in on a Saturday night and there had to be 40 people in 3 separate lines for Asada, Chorizo, Al Pastor, and a variety of other amazing meats and dishes. You choose a line based on meat, not size.  We stood in line for almost 25 minutes because it was Saturday at dinner time and the grill was cooking. The wait was 100% worth it.  There were 6 of us and we sent one person to save a table (it's hard to find a place to sit) and the rest savored the smells of what we were about to eat.   I ordered the Carne Asada fries and they were incredible along with a carne asada taco and 2 chorizo tacos. I ended up splitting the fries because it was a ton of food. The others in my group also got fries and taco variations and everyone loved their tacos.  I've eaten at lots of other taco places that I love (Taco y Taco, etc.) but Tacos El Gordo is quickly a top 1 or 2 on my taco list now. Everything is incredibly fresh and food is authentic and incredible.",

Words cannot describe how good these things are!   Other pros -- the tacos are super cheap - dirt cheap - compared to anything on or near the strip.  They also take credit cards!  3.  Adobada.  4.   Learn to say Adobada -- that's what you're going to want to order!  I tried a variety of tacos.  All were great, but my favorite was the Adobada.  The line for those specific tacos is longer than the rest.  Anytime I'm in LAs Vegas, I will definitely make a trip to grab a few tacos.  I'm telling you -- go now!",

    "text": "Hands down, best tacos ever!!  This place gets really busy and it can get very confusing if you don't know what you're doing.  There are 4 stations, 3 of them serve different kinds of meat, and the last station closest to the cashier is where you can ask for grilled veggies such as green onion/peppers.   1. Pick your meat 2. Find the line 3. Get a tray & tell 'em what you want! (if you want a different meat, go to the next line and repeat) Simple as that :)   After ordering tacos, be sure to hit up the last station (usually a lady is working it) and ask for grilled veggies, it's free and goes great with the tacos!  The cashier holds the salsa hostage in her mini fridge, so let her know how many red and/or green salsa you want after paying.   I've probably had almost every meat on the menu, but my favorite will always be adobada, it's spicy pork marinated in pineapple.  You can also ask for pineapple on top of your adobada taco.    Campechana fries is a mix of carne asada & adobada.  It's not on the menu, but you can order half orders of their fries for $5!  For a half order, it's still HUGE!    I usually get 2 tacos ($2/taco) for myself and a half order of campechana fries to share.  Happy belly and happy wallet!",

I remember thinking that the adobada tacos at the one in SD were  great, and the other stuff was just fine (good, but not amazing). So I came to this one with the same mindset.   Funny thing is that it kind of turned around. I like most of the other cuts of meat here; the El Pastor, Carne Asada, but my favorites are Tripa and Lengua. Tripa is a must. They get it nice and crispy, almost like chicharrones, and the texture adds so much to the taco. Lengua is really well flavored, carne has a good char flavor to it. If you want, the fries are also a good alternative, like Carne Asada Fries. Lengua fries makes it a little fattier and more savory which is also nice.  It's also close to downtown, so it's a great place to stop by before heading out there for some drinks.",

    "text": "This place might be the most chaotic taco shop you've ever stepped foot into, but it might be the best you've ever had.   Before you enter, know that there are three separate lines for food. Each line represents a variety of different meats - just take a gander at the sign in front of each window to see if your favorite protein falls under that category. The crappy part? If you want multiple types, then you need to stand in different lines. That's why the buddy system works wonders, especially if you all want a little of everything. Even then we still ended up consuming partially cold food because we were greedy and wanted stuff from each of the queues in the restaurant.  I heard this is a step up from the previous location that had almost no seating. We came on a Friday night and it was definitely jam packed with peeps, but we were able to secure a table for four without any problems. Again, this is where the buddy system comes into play and everyone needs to do their due diligence - it's almost fun how you all need to work together to ensure you don't starve at the end of it all.  I would run down each of the taco meats we had, but the spicy pork, chorizo and asada variations were all delicious. Not only that, they were STUFFED with meat and I had to eat some with a fork before trying to finish it off with my hands. No complaints as every morsel was absolutely fantastic. I do think the extra love and flavor comes from their amazing handmade, in-house created tortillas. Those things were perfecto in my eyes.  One thing that is a must is their asada fries. You're able to get it with any meat, but the beef was fab. We got the large to share amongst four, full grown adults and we barely finished. We were so full after the various tacos we had just pounded that it took a lot of courage and energy to muster up the strengeth to finish this heaping amount of delicious fries topped with steak, guac, cheese, and sour cream. You're gonna feel like you're about to give birth when you're done, but every bite is worth the pain you'll feel after over eating.  Parking is a cinch as they share spaces with a huge shopping center.  If you're in Vegas, you have to check this place out. It's delicious!",

    "text": "Tacos El Gordo is like King Taco in California. The hype is real and this place is not to be missed if you're ever visiting Las Vegas. I decided to come here after working a night shift, thinking that it wouldn't be busy at 10PM. Wrong. This place was super busy. Before coming, beware of long lines and bring at least two other people with you. Meats and orders are separated into three sections. If you're by yourself, you're gonna spend a lot of time waiting in line and cold tacos before you get to eat them. I waited almost 30 minutes before ordering and also got them to-go, which added about 20 minutes. After taking almost 1 hour to get home, I thought to myself \"These better be the best tacos ever\"...and they were!  FOOD:  Tacos El Gordo offer steak, chorizo, beef (head too), pork (spicy too), and lengua. No chicken. You can get these meats in a taco, mula, quesadilla, tostada, or with fries. I've only had mula's from one place ever so I was soooooo happy to see that Tacos El Gordo makes them. I ordered one carne asada taco and one chorizo mula. I wanted to try the pork and spicy pork but I didn't want to get into two other lines..next time! When chefs ask you \"everything\", this includes cilantro, onions, red sauce, and guac.   QUALITY: The meats are flavorful and delicious. Their tortillas are also made fresh to order. You'll see the tortilla lady and you already know when you see the tortilla lady. Although I waited nearly 1 hr to devour my taco and mula, it was worth the wait.   SERVICE: Waiting in line is the only downside. I wish they could come up with a better system. Currently, you have to stand in three different lines to order and then pay for your order at another counter.   ENVIRONMENT: This place is crowded and it deserves to be since great food is being made. There's outside seating area but be prepared to not find a table.   Overall, I really wish there was a spot closer I home (southwest) because I would come here at least once a week.",

At this location, about 12 girls were able to ponder over the menu and take our time. We ordered a variety of tacos and fries. I've definitely been missing my Cali-Mex tacos, and I was able to get my cravings fulfilled here.",

    "text": "Disclaimer: I had all my tacos with flour tortillas.   Observation #1: Get the salsas on the side. Using my own sauce combinations or limiting the salsa amount would have made the overall experience more enjoyable.   Observation #2: Surprisingly filling. The tacos look small but they really *stuff* them with meat. Fantastic meat-to-taco ratio. Although I'm still full from those meaty morsels, writing about them makes me wish I could hop over and throw down a couple more of those tasty tacos.   Observation #3: The brisket (suadero) was dry. Beef brisket tacos sounds like a good idea and maybe others will like it, but, even with all the sauce they toss on, it was dry and disappointing.   Observation #4: The hero was the lengua. Juicy and flavorful. It was the last taco I tried. I'd never had tongue before. And it was still my favorite. I don't know what salsa they used but it worked well. The adobada was in second (would go with less salsa). The buche was pretty good. Pretty juicy, good flavor but salsa did not help it. Chorizo was fine but not something I'd get again or recommend to someone else. I look forward to trying Cabeza and asada next time.",

I guess if I had to give one con it'd be that they are always packed to almost capacity if not right at it which to most it's a good thing for freshness of the food, however for people who like personal space it's a bit overwhelming.

It's just a great atmosphere.   People go here in droves just to get the adobada taco with its freshly made corn tortillas, topped with cilantro and diced onions, and doused with their special sauce. At about $2 a taco, prices can add up. I sure can't get enough of these things, though.   And be sure to take plenty of napkins, because these hand-eaten hunks of deliciousness can get pretty messy.

The carne asada tacos are decent (as are the tripe and lengua tacos), but, the spicy pork adobada tacos are golden. At $2 each, they can't be beat. If you're planning on visiting, make sure to order at least one of the adobada tacos, you'll thank me later.  The service is extremely friendly as well.  Originally from San Francisco, I'm a seasoned vet when it comes to cheap, delicious, hole-in-the-wall taquerias. I almost don't want to admit it, but these tacos are better than any I can remember having in the Mission.   I almost feel sorry for the taco shop across the way in the same strip mall, \"Los Tacos.\" Almost. They're good, but overpriced. I believe Los Tacos originated in San Francisco, around 24th and Mission, and they're overpriced there as well. A single taco shouldn't cost $5+.   Tacos El Gordo appears to have decimated the business at Los Tacos. It's funny driving between two competing taquerias where 90% of the cars are parked on one side of the lot. If they made burritos, I'd probably cry tears of joy.",

The Pastor(pork) is on a rotating spit with a chunck of Pinapple on top like it should be and it's the first thing you see when you walk in the door.  It has that sweet and smoky flavor any good Al Pastor should have.  I've been suckered into various taco joints in town that had a Pastor spit, hoping that I would find something as good as you can get in Mexico.  I've always come away very disappointed.  El Gordo's has it down.  The Carne Asada is marinated and grilled to perfection.  It has that distinct flavor of the Original El Gordo's in Tijuana.  Getting Asada this good is a rare occurence these days.  I've been all over Southern California and Vegas and I can only count 4 or 5 Taco stands that I've found in the last 15 years that even come close to this Asada.  When I first saw that the tacos were 2 bucks, I balked a little, but when I realized it was the same name as my favorite stand in Tijuana, I would have paid 4 bucks for a taco in hopes that it was half as good as I had remembered it.  The tacos are well worth the 2 bucks considering that they pack them full of meat and will top any taco off with as much guacamole, cilantro, and cebolla you want.  I've only been there three times since I found this place, so I haven't had a chance to try some of the other meats.  I'm sure everything is on point just based on the Asada & Pastor.  Next time I'll have to try the Lengua & Buche.",

After all, she's a fellow foodie.    Let me tell you, all it took was ONE.BITE.  I was hooked.    Ok, so this location isn't the safest place to head to at 1:30AM, but if  you grew up in my neighborhood it will only bring back memories, lol!  I'm sure you will mull through the other great reviews of this establishment, but at the time I rolled through there (1:30AM) there were five people eating inside, and two vagrants outside asking for spare change.    LADIES... I highly suggest taking a friend or friends if heading here late at night or before they close.   That being said, their ADOBADA tacos are just short of orgasmic.  Seriously, if my taste buds were capable of such activity, they did it.  The pork is marinated and cooked just right, with incredible flavor that remained very distinguishable even past the fresh diced onions and minced cilantro.  All of this is succulently nestled in perhaps the freshest tasting corn tortillas I've ever had.    They do not skimp on the amount, either... they are generously filled!  And what's up with that green sauce?

(just kidding about the crack...)  They have locations all over the Southland (LA) and in San Diego.  As far as Las Vegas goes, I will definitely make this a regular visit from here on out.  If you're a fan of street-style soft tacos, you owe it to yourself and your friends to give this place a try.  Go for the food, not the ambience!!  (... AAANND, for you hard shell taco fans, please look up my review on another Vegas great, Roberto's Taco Shop!)  Mahalos!!",

My boyfriend and I each got two Adobada tacos with pineapple and wish we had ordered more!  We wanted to try the asada, but after waiting for the ones we got we didn't feel like waiting any longer so we just ate them and left wanting more.  You really need more than two of these tacos if it's a full meal for you.  We are only giving four stars because we couldn't find anywhere to sit and had to stand up and eat our food while we were in the way of everyone wandering around.  They are very tasty and we can't wait to return for more!",

    "text": "For the sheltered American, it may take a bit of bravery to experience Gordo. It is not in the most pleasant neighborhood, it is very authentic Mexican, and there is a little bedlam going on when ordering while the place is busy. Be a little more brave when you get up to the counter and order things like tongue and tripa (intestines). If you can get your mind past your American upbringing, explosive flavors await. Do not expect anything past bare-bones decor and service at Gordo, because it certainly does not care about them either. This place is driven toward one goal: fast, tasty, authentic Mexican fare. And it not only reaches that goal, it kicks it in the balls and then stomps all over it (in a good way).",

We have had the carne asada tacos and the adobada sopes and carne asada fries              The soft taco's are great , we got them with everything on , some kind of avocado sauce , onions ,cilantro.  The adobada sopes were also good it's a spicy shreded pork not very hot spicy but flavorful spicy . Sopes are corn disk that are soft about 3/4 inch thick. We got everything on them avocado sauce, cilantro and onions.               The carne asada fries are covered in the same avocado sauce with of course carne asada , they also have them with the adobada pork, We got the 1/2 order which is more then enough for two.  Pretty neat place you order your food from the cooks , who make it right there and they also have grilled green onions and jalapenos that you can ask for , I think it was free.                           They also have different Mexican drinks at the soda fountain as well as regular sodas . Pretty good place to grab a meal or snack",

What!? diosmio. Really though, there are more pluses. Keep in mind, their fresca cheese. Their salsa is spicy enough to sucker punch me in the mouth but not as an anesthetic, and I can still taste the fireworks of sauce and meat and celantro all mixed in. They're cooking and prepping right in front so you know there's no silly hide & seek games, \"where are they taking my food?\" Believe me, these kids are authentic Mexican grub-lords. They're more than willing to sample you a piece of their carne. That's how confident they are- and they earned it.  It gets better, the ladies that work here don't joke about a clean environment. They're so fast, when a group heads out, they're already cleaning the table for the next..  All the workers are always smiling. 5 stars all day, and in my next 3 lifetimes.",

There is no way in hell a So Calian would ever roll east on Charleston, look at that tiny beat down location, and say \"oh yeah, I've got to stop here.\"  Not gunna happen.  Thanks to Yelp, we got the inside scoop.  There's only one mission you should have - open the door, walk in 5 steps to the inverted meat cone of spicy pork, and ask for quatro tacos while you point to the hanging pineapple being devoured by crimson death delight.  You will require nothing else.  Almost no one spoke English, which was friggin awesome.  I knew, right away, I was in the right place.  Ask to try the meat, and as their machete carves slivers of pig that had been dipped in love, rolled through crack, and gently slapped on the a$$, you'll find yourself slurping back an eighteen inch string of drool.  Go ahead, and try it.  You'll be licking the little Styrofoam saucer, looking like you've never set foot in a Mexican restaurant before.  Tongue hits juicy goodness, eyes open wide, and you look to your bro on the left and silently mouth \"WTF?!\"  Those tacos are just stupid.

    "text": "Being from Southern California undoubtedly makes you the hugest snob when it comes to Mexican food. And usually the rule of thumb is the farther you go from the border the higher the chances you will hit a dud.   However it was late on a Sunday night after a full weekend of nonstop raging in Vegas and we were on a quest for some sustenance for our 4.5 hour drive back to Socal. After one option was closed and another was too long of a line, Tacos El Gordo became our saving grace. We ordered our tacos on the phone togo as we drove our way over and were very pleased when they were ready once we got there!  The place was packed at 11PM on a Sunday night with locals which is always a good sign.  To my happy surprise all of the tacos were foil wrapped on plates separately which made sharing them so much easier. I was expecting huge togo boxes filled with tacos. You definitely get more bang for your buck if you order them with flour tortilla but I feel like that is a serious crime. They still do a very good job of giving you a lot of meat on the corn tortillas! I opted to try the a lengua, a carne asada, and adobada taco.   LENGUA: The lengua came in generous tender chunks! Not too chewy and very succulent I wish I had gotten more. However at $2.25 a pop I thought that was pretty pricey. But I guess that's what you have to pay for a decent taco in Vegas.   ASADA: The carne asada taco to me was pretty dry and chewy. I have definitely had better and I am glad I did not opt to just order only asada as I usually do.  ADOBADA: ADOWHA?! I was very excited to try the adobada taco as I don't see this type of meat on the menu at many places. They call it \"spicy pork\" there but it is not spicy at all. The pink tint on the skin of the pork reminds you a bit of chinese bbq pork and makes you almost wonder what it's doing in a taco. But boy is it so good! The meat is so delicious and plentiful! Now ever since that fateful day I have been on a search for some well reviewed adobada in Socal with no avail and cannot wait to get back to Vegas to get some more of this rare gem!",

Whether you are a tourist or local, you have to visit this place at least once when in the area. Located next to the Encore, there is free parking either at the Encore on in their parking lot (I visited at 1am, so parking was abundant, but the lot is on the small side).  What I ordered (you can ref pic in gallery): - Taco Asada (Beef) $2 - Taco Adobada (Spicy Pork) $2 - Taco Lengua (Beef Tounge) $2 - Mula Lengua (Quesadilla) $4 *Flour tortilla, but can get corn - Fountain Drink (Orange Bang) Free refills $1  I ordered all items with everything, as I wanted to try them as they should be. At first, the portions seem on the small side, but let me tell you, they are generous with the meat and it is filling.  Each item prepared fresh before your eyes. Service was friendly and very helpful seeing as it was my first time there, and spoke enough english to get the point accross. Establishment was very clean. All the meat was chopped evenly and tender. The various toppings complimented the corresponding meats perfectly. The flavors blending together were magical. If I hadn't just lost 95 pounds, I would have ordered another round of tacos, or three, and a few more mulas. Should have probably used a fork and knife for the mula, but it was 1am, was oozing cheesy goodness, and was ripe for consumption so I folded in half like a giant taco and went to work on it. I'm craving one right this moment.  Whether it is lunch, dinner, or a late night hunger fix, you need to go to Tacos El Gordo if you are anywhere near one. Highly recommended.",

When I finally got to the head of the Adobada / Al Pastor line and ordered 4 adobada and 4 Al pastor  just to have the guy tell me they were the same. Now I'm not Mexican but I have eaten alot of Mexican food and I know that Adobada and Al Pastor are not the same thing. At least not at all the other Mexican restaurants I have been to. But he didn't budge so I just ended up with 8 of the same tacos shaved off the spit. Then my buddy who was in the carne asada line said they had not cleaned the grill so all of the meat had burnt black bits all over it. And you could definitely taste it..... the carne asada was not tasty at all. The Adobada was ok but definitely not worth the wait. Oh and did I mention we had to go outside and sit on the curb to eat because the tables were all full.  None of this would have mattered if the tacos had just been great like they were supposed to be. Hell it would have added to the story of the quest for the great taco...... but this ain't the place!

Yeah, I've fallen for this place just like many others have. Even though part of my heart still belongs to my first (taco) love, Los Parados. But, that place is long gone and I'm just glad I finally have El Gordo to fill the void.  The adobada tacos ($2 ea.) are every bit as good as everyone says they are. The best part of the pork were the pieces carved from the exterior of the pork on a spit. They had an amazing crispy, charred edge to it that added to the transcendent flavor and texture combinations of the tacos.  And, don't forget about the carne asada tacos ($2 ea.). They're some of the best I've had in town. The quality of the beef was outstanding. The only thing I wasn't crazy about was the slimy green faux-guac sauce covering the meat. Next time I'll just have to get the tacos plain, with nothing but onions and cilantro.  Everyone seems to love this place, as evidenced by the long lines that snaked through the restaurant during the peak lunch time. So, whether or not you love tacos or are a taco virgin, stop by Tacos El Gordo and you'll be enthralled too.",

    "text": "Not doing it for me. At least just me for the great reviews I see here. I am happy to say I did not buy into the hype of everyone giving this place great reviews. This place, for me, is not all it's cracked up to be. Lucky I arrived on a slow night tonight. Okay so here is my reviews of the place. I pass by the place take the turn and walk in. Man that door heavy as f****! The place is spacious and I loved that. I found it pretty cool how they have the meat set up like a deli type thing and the line to pay big as well; I liked that.    So here I order two tacos de asada and the meat looked good along with the condiments. I was surprised that when he asked me if I wanted everything he didn't put chilly... But I guess you put it aside, but even more surprising than that was the fact that he put avocado on it. I was like, \"Thats a twist\" I was surprised because I do know some tacos shops that do that, but it was surprising because the Tacos El Gordo in the San Fernando Valley, California both inside and the taco truck don't do that.     Screw it lets go with it. I go and order and realize the salsas were inside the fridge, I liked that so everyone won't fight in the snack bar to grab there condiments. Yeah yeah I pay and I also got some lengua tacos aside. Now those did have the O.G. taste. As for mine they were more to be desired. I loved that they packed in the meat. Here we go with the flavor detail... Okay. The tortilla used was the yellow kind I like those so that can slide. The meat of the carne asada had a good flavor, but I felt it needed a little bit more of a way to hold on to the flavor of the meat. I added the \"spiciest\"  salsa to only to my disillusioned self... that IT... WAS... NOT... SPICY! That blew my mind.    The thing, I believe, that took off the flavor was the fact that it was inside the fridge. That salsa tasted like nothing, NOT EVEN A HINT OF FLAVOR WAS LEFT! So now imagine this... not your regular corn tortilla with sub par meat with good flavor topped off with boring salsa and flavorless avocado. I thought when they added the avocado it was going to have a kick to it, or if that didn't have a kick to it it would have been the taco itself to rescue the flavor, but no.    So I'm just sitting there debating if I should have a different one to change my mind. So I do order another one. The tacos are a little pricy only because of my experience. I order one de adobada. because it says spicy. I get the taco and already am doubting it just because that meat is more pinker that Patrick from sponge bob and the guacamole was watery as fuck... Should guacamole look white/green? Not in my experience, but whatever. I taste it and am automatically turned off. Screw this I am not coming again. The only thing I am grateful for is that they do stuff you good and the seating it great. But I am guessing THIS tacos el gordo have there own distinct flavor in Las Vegas.    The Gordo I frequently would go had the same type of meat, same type of flavor, but the difference between these and those is that when they flip the meat they don't lightly press down on it. They flip it and  to press down on it a little longer to grab that tighter locked in meat flavor. Even if that meat was the same and the same yellow tortilla it would still taste good. But what doesn't do it for me was the avacado and chilly with yellow tortilla that just added texture than a taco. Over there it was nothing fancy just your salsa outside, room temperature; white corn tortilla and pressed down meat and they were GREAT!    If you want a little taco flavor with new ingredients added go here, if you want that Mexico street vendure/ establishment taco shop go somewhere else. I got full, but not the good happy full. My who'll deal is that this Tacos El Gordo is different than the one I used to go. More pricier, different ingredients added and different flavor because of it. I have ate tacos for a many years and I do acknowledged they all have their own, but they do not steer away from the main point. I expected more thats all. I would suggest Tacos El Rey and Tacos El Torito they still do it for me. Plus they are cheaper. If I were to know they would be not your average joe I would have not cared.",

    "text": "Well, it is what it is.  If you want those little tacos with sizzling meat slabbed on as it's grilling, topped with veggies, pico de gallo, and other sauces all in about 10 seconds flat, tasting all delish with proper grilled taste, this is the place to go.  It's a close facsimile of El Taorina, except I think it's better.    Line doesn't move terribly fast but once you get up to order it goes quickly.  Then you line up at the pay line and that can take a bit also, but all in all not a bad wait overall.  I guess it all depends on when you go, and if there are 15-20 people in line I can see it taking a bit of time before you sit down to eat.  As it was for us, there were only couple of tables open as we were cashing out but we only spent total of less than 10 minutes through the entire process.  That's pretty good for that level of busy-ness, I think.  The Asada and Adobada were both very good, but the the spicy adobada took the cake.  Outstanding stuff.  $2 each, thinking 3 will be enough for most, maybe 4, so not a bad price for lunch and definite bargain for dinner.  Table-for-1 Factor:  Well, it is a fast-food type of place so it's certainly fine, but you'll have a hard time feeling good about taking a whole table all by yourself with all those people waiting...  Take it to go.",

    "text": "SPICY PORK TACO! Adobada, how do I describe my love for this bad boy?  1) DAT SAUCE! The taco Gods were kind enough to share their nectar of life with us lowly beings and not only drizzle, but give this taco a drenching bath in a creamy sauce of deliciousness. I have no idea what kind of ingredients they put in this sauce, but I hope it's illegal because something that tastes this good is pure addiction.  2) SPICY PORK! Meat so huge its as though if you stuffed your face and tore meat from the bone with your own teeth. There was so much in this taco, they did not skimp out at all like some other places. It also had so much flavor, I am salivating just thinking about it.   3) CILANTRO! SHUT THE FRONT DOOR! I am a huge cilantro lover and the herbiness with the cream sauce, pork meat, and corn tortilla was NOM NOM NOM! I can seriously ask for a ton more because cilantro is so amazing.  4) The adobada really isn't spicy according to my standards as I have a gazillion spice level tolerance. But, I poured a whole container of the green sauce they have to the side table, and it gave my tacos that extra kick with the cream sauce.  5) LITTLE MEXICAN LADY! How AWESOME & NICE can she be?!?! I called in to pick up 10 tacos for my friends and I. First thing she does is answer in Spanish, that's how you know this place is LEGIT! After asking to speak in English, I could tell that she was super busy with other customers in line. Drove for about 5 minutes, and i was expecting to wait in the store for our 10 tacos, but as soon as I walked up to the counter, she said \"You called for the order Huh?\" @__@ How did she know? I didn't even say a single word to her. Psychic powers? And out from under the counter she pulled the most beautiful plastic bag FULL of tacos already packaged in little plates, foils, plastic forks, spoons, napkins, sauces in containers, and horse radish in ziplock bags! Customer service was so fast, amazing, and nice at 10PM on a packed Sunday night that it made my taco taste a bazillion times better!  Tacos El Gordo, until we meet again in Vegas!",

    "text": "3 Commandments to Tacos El Gordo  1) Learn Spanish or bring an amigo who does. They seriously do not speak English here. I am not very good at Spanish so I had to communicate through a series of grunts and broken Spanish phrases that had nothing to do with ordering food.  2) Stand in the different lines based on the different type of tacos you want. You order your tacos and then after you get them you bring them all up to the cash register. Grab the condiments, limes, beets, etc. on the side next to the soda fountain. Order a cup of horchata to help wash down the tacos.   3) Get the loaded carne asada fries. These things are amazing and ginormous. Please do not get one to eat all by yourself. You need at least 3 other friends to eat with. You may pass out or hurt yourself while operating heavy machinery.   Heed these rules and you will have partaken in one of the most legendary Mexican food experiences of your life.",

The tacos are largely prepared like your average street taco (/w onions and cilantro) and salsa. However, the meat is always well cooked and very flavorful. They have great options, my personal favorites being the Buche, Adobada /w pinapple, and it becomes a toss up between Tripa or Lengua. If you're starving, go for some Adobada fries; a large plate of French fries loaded with the slow roasted adobabda seasoned pork, cheese, guacamole, a bit of sour cream and salsa.",

The muala was pretty good but the entire time I was eating it, I kept wishing I had ordered it with adobada.  Not that the carne asada was bad, it's just that the pork was unbelievably good!  I agree with Misti Y. that the peppers and onions added absolutely nothing to the meal. Skip them and fill up on the delicious spinning wheel o' pork.

Pastor and asada both had lots of flavor, tender and they filled the tacos up with meat. The asada fries where a good size, wish everything on it was warmer as it tasted like i was eating cold fries and toppings. Once you order you get your food then go to another counter to pay very trust worthy for the area it is in. Did not seem to slow down at all, and looked to have security on it at all times. Its worth it for a good priced and sized tacos not so much the fries.",

I had a tough time figuring out what's really going on. They have three super are sections to order your meats so I made that mistake in ordering everyone in one section. Thankfully they called over someone who spoke English and helped me order my tacos.   When I finally order and sat down with my tacos I noticed I didn't get one of my orders. My fault for not knowing Spanish. They serve everything super fast, faster than fast food.   Beef tongue, steak and the spicy pork were my choices today. Honestly the beef tongue was my favorite of the three. Still can't believe I tried it ! Sounds gross but it was super soft and didn't resemble anything like a tongue. Highly recommend ya to try it.",

Came here for lunch there was a huge line and being summertime in Vegas it was extremely hot outside, they offered water while we waited. The food was great and the tortillas are made by hand, but for the price and the size to me is ridiculous. Considering the fact that most places I  like only sell them for $1 here they were $2.25 but people will stay pay the price. Overall, good food but come on you can find authentic good decent sized tacos for $1 not worth it for me at least especially when they are mini size.",

Walking in you may ask yourself, what line for what? I admit if I had not learned Spanish through Rosetta Stone I'd be tornadoing in confusion. But take your time to google the meats before you choose your lines and you will be fine!  The taco dilemma was in full effect here. What combination plate should I create?  My Taco Creation  (2) Asada: The asada was nice. It wasn't full of fatty pieces nor was it over salty. You can taste a bite and feel like you're in your mothers vecindario. 4.25/5  (1) Lengua: I always need that tongue action and Tacos El Gordo gave it to me nicely. Soft and chewy and flavorful, no fault here. 4.25/5  (1) Al Pastor: Would of been 2 but someone drunk dropped one. My favorite out of them all. The meat was marinated to perfection. 4.75/5  (1) Asada Sope: This was okay, sope ingredients were eh. 3/5  Tortillas: Not handmade but it's a street taco not a mercado taco. Fits the schema well.   Customer Service was Mexican fast paced, meaning no smiles, just order and keep it moving, except for the cashier (;  Tacos are made to be eaten here. It's quite that simple.",

I normally get Diet Coke but was drinking a lot of it today.  There's plenty of seating inside and restrooms in the back. There's also outside seating but it was cold.   A great place to eat at.

    "text": "This place was recommended by Yelp. My girlfriends and I were looking to get a quick bite to eat during our lunch break. It was Tuesday, so we figured what a nice taco Tuesday treat. We knew the place was popular so we were prepared to wait. Luckily, we all drove separately and found parking spots and only waited about five minutes in line and then another five minutes to get our order. I had to look up what some of the tacos actually meant. I ended up just getting a basic Carnitas taco. Only one. I figured because I'm not super savvy on the authentic Mexican cuisine I should take it slow at first. I actually forgot to pay because I didn't get a drink, and where you get your drink is where you pay so it was pretty easy. She had to find where I was sitting and have me pay. The place was very busy and all the other reviews said it would be busy so it has to be pretty good. For me, however one taco was delicious but it's not really my bag.",

So when you walk in it's packed and there's a line for different tacos so if you want asada you have to stand in 1 line and then get in another for whatever else you want. So I tried the asada and adobada. First off the asada was dry and had no flavor. The adobada was better but still not amazing. I had an upset stomach after I ate the tacos and I ended up throwing up. Honestly I wouldn't even feed this to a dog.",

The taqueros are fast and always friendly, very clean restaurant with cool windows. The only thing you may have to be understanding is depending on the time or day, it can be packed and the lines to order tacos are long. The salsas are so goood. Try tacos al pastor with everything on them, you will not regret.",

    "text": "I have to say this place ruined Mexican food for me (granted I know there are probably places out there that blows this place out of the waters) but all in all, this place wasn't everything it was cracked up to be.   I just moved here from out of state and was looking for something quick, cheap, and anything but places like McDonald's or Taco Bell. So I took to yelp to help me out.   First impressions of this place was that it felt a little crammed. Being it was out first time there we had ZERO idea of what the hell was going on. My girlfriend and I don't speak Spanish but as soon as we walked we were greeted in Spanish. (Makes me want to learn some Spanish to avoid situations like this, lesson learned.) Unbeknownst to us the lines were broken into the different types of meats we wanted and we had no idea. So we stood in the shortest \"Order Here\" line and waited a good 15 minutes to get to the front. Finally got to the front and began ordering, as soon as we said out meet the cook cut us off mid sentence and told us he doesn't have our meats and we need to go stand in another line, meaning we had to get out of that line we were in and go in the back of the line of the meat that we wanted was.   Finally after waiting another 10 minutes we got to the front of the line and began ordering. At first we ordered 4 tacos because we thought the portions were a little small. After making the first 4 tacos my girlfriend and I realized we would probably still be hungry so we ended asking the cook if he could make 2 more tacos. IMMEDIATELY this fool had major attitude. He gave my girlfriend the dirtiest look for asking for 2 more tacos. At this point I about had it and was ready to walk out. Our cook half assed making the taco threw the taco together just to get us out of his presence all while slamming covers and saying things under his breathe. (One can only imagine what he was saying.)   Finally got our tacos and we had to pay. Since we got 6 tacos we paid nearly $15. They charge $2.25 for tacos that are honestly worth $1.50 at most. You're better off taking your $15 and going to a Chick-Fil-A or Taco Bell. Way $$$ goes way further there.   Now as far as the tacos goes, they were alright. Can't say that this place was a hit out of the park as I've tasted better \"tacos\" at Taco Bell. We got Taco de asadas and tbh I was expecting more after reading all these reviews on here but to be honest they're all hype. I'll probably never be coming back to this particular locations, I'd like to give this place the benefit of doubt and trying other locations.",

Oddly, there are two separate lines for certain meats. My boyfriend and I Waited in line for about 25 minutes in the \"carne asada line\" Which was long enough so I didn't get to try the el pastor. Not to mention place was about 25 minutes drive.   Let's just say I've had better tacos and quesadillas. The meat was a low quality, unseasoned, no flavor very bland almost paper like. The \"salsa\" was more like pico de Gallo and the \"avocado\" was a blended paste of some sort. The cheese in my quesadilla was not even melted, partially cold and topped off with a burnt corn tortilla.   The tortillas are handmade and fresh, I'll give them that. But other than that, their operations are very confusing. Place was decent, not worth the hype.

As you enter the restaurant you will notice three stations at the front counter. Each station has a tip jar(?) and on each jar is listed the types of tacos prepared at that station. We had lengua, tripas and cabeza tacos. All tender and succulent. Did I just use \"succulent\"? The horchata is from a powder mix. I can cope. The grilled peppers are fantastic alongside the tacos. Norteno/Banda music blaring. Stuffed bull heads mounted on the walls. Go with an open mind and a healthy appetite and have a good time. One of my coworkers asked if she needed a passport to travel to this part of town. Funny Anglo.",

I decided to get only carne asada (and I don't see why anyone else wouldnt). The tacos are fairly priced, considering that they don't skimp on meat and do include guacamole with each one at no additional cost. I'm a man with a moderately respectable appetite (king burger and fries at Fatburger) and I was satisfied with 3 tacos at lunch time. They didn't stuff me by any means but I was full enough and my wallet wasn't too light either. The combination of the cilantro, lime, onions and house salsa was enough to satisfy my craving for real mexican tacos. If all you care about is tacos, this is the place for you.",

And consider yourself lucky if you get a slice of pineapple off the top of the grease spindle, the sweetness really helps the flavors pop.

As we were walking up to the place we noticed it was packed. That is always a good sign. There were also a lot of Mexican people there, usually another good sign. As busy as it was, the line went quickly. The menu is pretty simple and I chose the asada tacos and the adobada tacos. They were filled with meat, onion, cilantro, salsa and an avocado green sauce. It was almost hard to pick them up since they had so much meat in them. I like they don't skimp on the meat :) Both tacos were very good, although I liked the adobada better.  I highly recommend that if you're in Vegas and you feel like tacos you hit this place up.",

I can definitely see orthodox Mexican people who see this place as \"nothing special\" or its \"ok\" but I think this place is awesome. I usually line up at the offal counter, which I see the least amount of people.. People have no idea what they are missing. My favourite among the offal tacos is the tripa the texture is unbelievable, and what seemed to be a \"salsa rioja\" was perfect for it. Cabeza taco was my next favourite, I loved it because I am a fan of artery clogging, \"eat it in moderation\" kind of foods. This taco had a very soft beef flavour presented shredded and chopped, served with I guess a salsa verde sauce and cilantro if I remember correctly. I then had the tongue taco, which was okay, not my favourite texture, it had a slithery like texture going down the throat which was interesting. Beef brain taco was an experience; I would consider it to look clumpy and the taste was very neutral, it was somewhat rich and cooked fork tender. Moving on to the standard meat tacos(San Diego location), my favourite was the steak. It had a pleasantly chewy texture, served in strips, I think it has again the salsa verde cilantro mixture and I cannot remember if it was spicy. Tacos adobadas was also delectable, the pork was crispy on the outside, cooked nicely on the inside. Unfortunately I do not remember the sauce or the ingredients but I do remember they all worked in harmony. It's been a while since the San Diego location so I cannot remember the others I tried, but everything was perfect.",

Confusing as heck on how to order but it goes as follows:   The line with the pork hanging on a spit is for pork adabado.   The line in the center is for tongue, brains, aka nasty bits that my friends who like their food a bit more \"authentic\" swear by.   Then the last line where someone is making tortillas is for chorizo, steak, and probably chicken, but I always order the chorizo so no clue.   The staff speaks English, but they move fast so if you want no onions, no sauce, no avocado (and you're sick if you don't get the avocado)  speak quickly and clearly. They are super nice though and remade three tacos after my husband corrected them that he didn't want onions on his pork tacos.",

After that, as long as you steer clear from the Tripa and Sesos, everything else is pretty good.        - Ordering - You grab a tray and you go up to one of the three guys and order your tacos. Adobada is on the right. Carne Asada is on the left. Most of the other ones are in the middle.        - Neighborhood - This place isn't in the greatest neighborhood. However, there are mostly families in there and it's well lit so you should be fine. **Ordered**        - $2 Taco De Adobada (Spicy Pork) - The greatest taco I've ever had. It's cut from a giant rotating pork wheel. Genius (<a href=\"http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/CiYLq33nAyghFkUR15pP-Q?select=KTg0vlPNZqaZC4m7oh1nKw\">yelp.com/biz_photos/CiYL...</a>).        - $2 Taco De Lengua (Beef Tounge) - It tastes like very tender beef. It's delicious and a must try.        - $2 Taco De Asada (Carne Asada) - It's good carne asada, but there are definitely other things to try.        - $2 Taco De Buche (Pork) - Tender, but not as good as the adobada.        - $2 Taco De Cabeza (Cow Head) - It's just like regular beef.        - $2 Taco De Tripa (Cow Intestines) - I was expecting tripe like in pho but got intestines. I found out that tripa didn't translate into tripe when I got home. Regardless, I didn't finish this taco.        - $2 Taco De Sesos (Cow Brains) - This was also a miss for me.         - $10 Adobada Fries - Best in a group. Skinny fries covered with adobada meat, cheese, guac, and mayo. It's delicious but will also slow your insides down for the next couple hours (<a href=\"http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/CiYLq33nAyghFkUR15pP-Q?select=h3ntc5q93sgsWcQUOofnZQ\">yelp.com/biz_photos/CiYL...</a>). **Recommendations**        - I'd definitely recommend this place.

It's not 100% perfect, - the tortillas are a little gummy and the chorizo is surprisingly balnd - but everything else is spot on.  First off, great people. I asked about the sudero (so sorry if I butcher the Spanish language here) and next thing I knew, I had a sample in hand! Not only that, but I was rewarded for my attempt at speaking Spanish with a plate of grilled veggies on the house! Spicy pork is to die for. Sudero is amazing. Really worth the trip.   *Note that it's pretty much just pork and beef so if you don't like mammals, you're out of luck. BUT if you like it authentic (cabeza, brains, etc.,) then you're in luck.

I got there about 11pm an the place was packed, it was a Monday night. They actually have 3 different lines for ordering food, it depends on the kind of meat you want, that is a little weird but ok. Anyway the food was great, specifically the tacos, I usually order a carne asada burrito but they don't have that option, what???? I should drop a star just for that but I won't. The tacos turned out to have great flavor an were a good size. I even ordered 4 more to go for later on that night in the room. They keep the place clean, the price is ok, I just wish they had burritos, still I will definitely make a return trip on my next visit to Vegas. TACOS ARE PRETTY BOMB.",

We got here and The line was long and it took about an hour to order our food. They have a couple of lines for different items. I ordered two asada and two lengua. I also asked for grilled peppers and onions on the side which is free. I also got a drink with my meal. The tacos are so delicious and tasty. You need to get the hot sauce and put in your taco it so worth it and make it taste even better. The taco was literally fresh off the grill when I got it. The services was fast, friendly, and helpful. The parking was okay since it in a big plaza. Definitely worth the time waiting in line for good tacos! I will be back again to try their other items on their menu.",

If you've never been there before, the way you order can be really confusing. There's actually separate lines depending on what kind of meats you want to order. So look at the signs to see where you want to line up!   I had asada tacos, lengua tacos, and carne asada fries. The steak was cooked to perfection, it wasn't chewy. However, the lengua was definitely my favorite! At first I thought the lengua was going to be a little dry, but it tasted amazing. It wasn't dry at all! I love cilantro, and they gave me a lot on my tacos!   I got a half sized carne asasa fries, and it was pretty big for it being half sized. For $7, I think it's worth it! My friend and I shared and we were so stuffed, we couldn't even finish it. I can't even imagine what a full sized looks like!  I will definitely be coming back here to get my taco fix!",

The ladies working the register hustle hard to keep the place clean which is so greatly appreciated.  It took about 20 min to finally get to the front of the line we were standing in (adobada/al pastor). I ordered 3 al pastor tacos and omfg they were so good. I love how they put that avocado salsa right on the tacos. It's so creamy and delicious. We got some salsa verde as well which was pretty damn spicy, but the al pastor tacos came with some pineapple chunks on the side which was nice to tame the heat a little bit.  The line system is really weird and I feel like it's super inconvenient for people who want to order more than one kind of taco, but luckily for me, I only ever want al pastor tacos so it doesn't bother me too much. Can't wait to be back!",

Asada and chorizo on left, lengua and cabasa in the middle, and adobada and pastor on the right. I ate the carne asada tacos and al pastor tacos with everything on them, which is essentially onions, cilantro, tomatoes, gaucamole, and house special hot sauce. The meats definitely did me right with the tenderness and juiciness. They give a plentiful amount of meats in each taco. And the fries are skinny ones, which are my favorite. The customer service is excellent, people are very nice. So tip them! I look forward to coming back here every time I'm in Las Vegas.  Tip: If you didn't arrive solo, split up to the different lines to maximize efficieny.",

    "text": "Some major competition to King Taco in LA, literally to tee! The tacos are amazing and the menu is simple street food style. The Al Pastor tacos are my favorite but I wish they did the fresh corn tortillas on more than just the carne asada tacos. I also wish they added a tiny slice of pineapple as per traditional Al Pastor, but they were still amazing nonetheless. The carne asada tacos are also pretty damn incredible, though the added guac/avocado puree could be spared. Don't get me wrong, I love avocados and guac but a True taco keeps it simple with onion and cilantro. The fresh made tortillas are absolutely amazing to finish this off.   My only complaint is their ordering system. I'm not sure who or what made it into one where lines are broken up by certain meats being served, but you can get a super unbalanced lineup with people in the Al Pastor line and more in the carne asada line. Waiting until you have all your food to go pay is also a bit of a hassle since you could have almost all but waiting in line for the last item you want gets your food to get cold. I'm sure there could be some amazing and creative way to solve this problem here, but either way their tacos are amazing. You can get sopes, quesadillas and other goodies there too, but I kept it to the tacos. Be ready for some potentially long lines if you go at busy times.",

    "text": "Who doesn't love tacos right!? Tacos el Gordo is truly the most successful taco place here in Vegas. Would I say they're the best... ehh so so.   The reason why I did not give them five stars is because of how their set up is. I find it beyond annoying to have to get in line for every type of meat on top of having to wait again to pay. Your hands are full of tacos, their getting cold, lines are always long. By the time you pay, go get your drink sit down and start eating, your tacos are cold. In general I like my food hot I don't know about you guys.   I always get tacos or half Alpastor fries.  Sometimes I wonder how cooked their meat is so I always have them cook the meat a bit extra and use only one tortilla.  The Alpastor fries are pretty tasty just wish the hot sauce was more spicy because I find the creamy green sauce to be a bit too sweet.  Order the complimentary grilled jalapenos and green onions, they're tasty.   Over all tacos are good but not the best. Every few months I crave them and every time I go I remember why this place is not a regular.  Staff is friendly cannot complain, and I find it to be very clean as well.",

In fact, this one is so legit that I was one of the only non-Latino people here in twilight hours, and it was packed. This location is way better than the one on the strip because THERE IS TONS OF PARKING. Also, the line is SO much shorter!   Carne asada fries... even a half order is monstrously large. But you should get them anyway. Either share with a friend or if you need to eat your feelings.  Those mulas. Who doesn't love fresh tortilla with griddled cheese?  Adobada is what they are famous for. Get a mula with adobada. Double win.  Maybe it's just me, but horchata on a fountain just doesn't taste good. I found it terrible, but I've only had fresh horchata at little mom and pop shops.  Super awesome dude chopping up all of the meat for orders. I was a lost puppy not really knowing what i was doing, but he was so super patient with me anyway and just super nice. Often people get annoyed when in a customer service-based industry, but everyone working here was really nice.  See ya again next time at 3AM, Tacos El Gordo!",

We made a couple of rookie mistakes, you need to be in the right line per the meat you want on your tacos or fries.  We ended up getting el pastor tacos and a small adaboda fry.  The fries were ridiculously good and the tacos awesome. It was so crowded we just decided to get it to go and took it downtown to the Container Park for a mid day picnic.    This place could easily triple in size and still be SRO, the food is absolutely great.",

I suggest going with at least 1 other person so you don't have to wait in all the lines. We had no problem though because it was pretty empty! Once you get all your food, you pay at a separate station.  We ordered 2 carne asada tacos, 2 adobada tacos, and carne asada/adobada fries. All items were delicious. Personally, I enjoyed the adobada meat more than the carne asada. I thought it was tastier and had good flavor. And those fries were not hard to finish at all! :P If I ever come back, I would just get adobada on my fries.  Service was friendly and the place nicely kept.

We ordered the Taco Asata instead (Steak).  The meat was tough and stringy and not seasoned to my liking.  We also got a quesadilla.  The cheese was spongy more like egg then cheese.  My son ordered onions and peppers on the side.  The items were not cut but served whole.  They were also not regular onions but spring onions.  One of them came lodged in my throat and I literally had to pull it out with my hand.  Awful. Over $13 for 4 street sized taco / quesadillas and 2 soda cans.  They will never see us again.",

    "text": "The tacos here are magnificent. But before we get started with the big review, some quick tips.  1. The meats are divided into sections with INDIVIDUAL lines!  2. There are two locations for Tacos El Gordo, the second one being near the Encore.  3. This locations prices are a little bit better, but if you're driving from the strip, it's probably more worth it to go to the first location.  4. Try the Adobada tacos, their carne asada tacos are equally good too!  5. For the Adobada tacos, everything means all the fixings EXCEPT for the pineapple! Ask the guy making them for a tiny slice of tacos.  6. The fries come in three flavors: campenchana, adobada, or ANY meat. Don't be fooled that the sign says adobada or campenchana only.  7. The fries come in half/full size, a half size is more than enough for two people to share and just right for three to sample!  8. Plenty of parking! Two entrances!  After discovering Tacos El Gordo on our second trip to Vegas, we have gone back every single time to eat at their fine establishment. There are MANY meats to choose from, but by far our favorite is the adobada. My personal one that I really like is the carne asada.  What truly sets apart Tacos El Gordo is that they grill up/fry up their meat right in front of you. You can watch them cooking up your stuff and making the tacos. Another thing that I really enjoy is the great service. Every single time we've been there, they've always been really nice to me and my girlfriend. I think it might because they see us as Asians in a Mexican joint who have no idea what's going on. But beyond that, the place is really clean. They wipe down tables after people are done and the cleaning ladies usually offer to take our trays for us when we're still sitting down and finished.  The last thing is the price. For Vegas, this place is a steal. We usually get somewhere from 6 tacos, a drink, and a half order of adobada fries for $20.  Awesome food, awesome service, awesome price! What more could you want?!",

We were so very disappointed. Quesadilla very expensive (4.50) for the size, street taco size and again, and not good. We spent over $20 for a variety of food and threw it all away after just a couple of bites of each item. The place was packed and we were not sure why that was. Apparently some people dont mind tough meat to chew on.",

The carne asada is okay, but boring. The lengua is also a standout. Wallet-friendly prices, which is such a welcome relief in Vegas and on the Strip -- especially if you're dirt frickin' poor from losing all your money gambling.  *Thumbs down* First time stepping in, it can get a bit confusing on where to order. There are supposed to be different stations for each type of taco, but just brush up on your Spanish and go loco. Just look for the big, rotating juicy pile of meat and order there.",

Sure, it's fun to watch a guy chop beef and scoop it onto your carne asada taco. However, that doesn't warrant a five star rating.  Let me be clear, the tacos are delicious. Probably the best tacos in Vegas. Is it the best priced Mexican fast food in Vegas? Not even close. Just because something is $2 doesn't mean it's a good deal. I'd have to buy 5-6 tacos here to become full, whereas one burrito at Roberto's or Fausto's will fill me up at half the price. I rate as much with my wallet as I do with my taste buds. If your restaurant looks like a hole in the wall and has a hole in the wall service system, then I'd better get hole in the wall pricing too.",

    "text": "waited in line for my \"Adobada Taco\" and after eating it I was bummed I didn't get 2 of them! For me it was the clear winner! Unless you don't want it on your taco it comes with onions, cilantro, and an avocado sauce. I asked for the pineapple on my taco and I couldn't ever imagine ordering a taco again without it! My man had the \"Asada Taco\" and he said for him that was the clear winner. I have renamed the tacos here at Tacos El Gordo. They are now called \"Crack Tacos\". I'm addicted! I loved it so much I asked if we could go back the next day and I got no complaints! The tacos are only $2.00 each. The food is made fresh right in front of you. I thought it was awesome to see this lady making tortillas right in front of me and knowing that tortilla she was making was going on my plate. You can choose corn or flour tortillas. If you want they offer free grilled scallions and peppers to eat along with your food.  I like this location better then the other one. I don't know what it is about the LV Blvd location but it didn't have the same feel and the tourists might have something to do with that I don't know. There is more seating inside at this location as well.  Parking can be a pain but it is because everyone else knows where the crack tacos are too. If you go with a group then you might want to designate someone to get a table.  I can't say enough about this place! Just eat here already!",

    "text": "I finally found it!!! A True authentic tacos place that is both affordable and good. I stopped by Tacos El Gordo for lunch and the place was packed, mostly spanish speaking customers, so you know you're in the right place for tacos, but still felt a little bit out of place being the only asian guy there.   There were several lines that you can order tacos from, I guess depending on meat you want. You can choose from adobada (spicy pork), asada, tripa (tripe), lengua (tongue), chorizo, etc...Fortunately, the guy behind the counter asked what I wanted to order and basically I ordered one of each, just so I know if they're good. The taco is not that big (size of krispy kreme donut in diameter but 1/4 as thick) and only costs 2 bucks each, so it didn't break my wallet or my belly.   Every single one of them was tasty... yum yum. The food was fresh and flavorful. My co worker complained that they put too much cilantro, but I think it's no big deal. You can take it out if you don't like it.   One tip for those that like green onion and jalapeno, They have some grilled green onion and jalapeno available as a side dish. Delish when added to the tacos. Also, they don't have to go box, so if you want your order to go, they just wrap the plate in aluminum foil.",

It seemed to be raving with good reviews so I went there.  I got one carne asada taco and one adobaba taco. Many of the reviews said the carne asada taco was flavorful and delicious when to my dismay....it wasn't THAT good as I thought it would be. The meat was bit different than it was over in TJ and it definitely was bland. The guacamole didn't help it at all so I was saddened.  However the ADOBABA taco....WAS to die for! I loved every bite of it so much that I went back for a second one. Trust me, if you got adobaba tacos, you will not be disappointed. It's spicy and just perfect for your tastebuds.  I was going to get the carne asada fries, but after trying the taco, I wasn't going to get it and besides it costs 10 dollars to get it. o_O  Just get the adobaba tacos, do not miss out on this-  I'll come back to this place when I'm in Vegas the next time!",

    "text": "Is this love?   Ever since I first stepped into Tacos El Gordo, I couldn't stop thinking of the adobado taco. As soon as I laid eyes on that twirling mountain of spicy pork slowly being marinated by the roasting pineapple up top, I knew this was the one. It was love at first sight.   I was confused upon walking in though. As an Asian who struggled through Spanish 101, I felt foreign here. Everything seemed so fast-paced and busy. I stood back on the sidelines to evaluate and plan how I was going to tackle my first taco order.   I stood there, staring at the menu for a few minutes in confusion. Apparently, the counter is divided into sections which serve the particular meat desired. Luckily, English got me through just fine. People behind the counter are friendly and very quick to construct your taco. I wasn't really familiar with any of the meats on the menu, so I just pointed at things that looked good.  \"I want two of that one.\" \"Can I get two of that?\"  Apparently, my point and get method served me well. I ended up with two adobado tacos (spicy pork)  and two carne asda tacos. $2 a taco. Not bad.  These tacos were some of the best things I've eaten in a long time. They were so good, in fact,  that I went back up for more. Authentic tacos made with love; my favorite kind.   Tacos El Gordo, you will see me back very soon. This time, I'll know what I'm doing.",

    "text": "Its been too long since I've had Carne Asada and I'm so glad that this place filled that dying need! Flashbacks of roadtrips to TJ/Baja Cali!! Came here during lunch time and place was filled (not one table available and they had plenty). Hey, must be a good sign!  *Ordering Food was Different Here - There were different lines for like different vendors.. Facing the counter - For example: Left side for the chili peppers, Right of that for Carne Asada and  on the Far Right for the Adobada (spicy pork). They have little pails/tip jars on top of the counter that had labels on them that displayed what each station served. Interesting concept..  Carne Asada (steak) tacos: I have been down south numerous times in the past and have had the chance to try some street vendor tacos and this had similarity.. Probably better.. They did serve them on homemade corn tortillas (you can ask for flour if you please) and the typical cilantro, tomato and onions plus guacamole. The steak had its own unique flavor (much different from Robertos), tender and the tortilla just sealed the deal!   Adobada (spicy pork) tacos: This was a first for me, and won't be the last.. This staton had the longest line for a tasty reason! They shave off the meat from a vertical Rotisserie (like Shawarma), same toppings as the asada except instead of the guac they add this light green sauce. The pork was dark in red in color, super soft, had an unfamiliar yet delicious flavor and the creamy green sauce was the Star of the taco! Another spoonful of the Salsa Verde, Por Favor!    Yellow & Green Chili peppers and Green Onion Strands: I had a bite of each with just about every bite of the tacos.. Delish!  And Now for the Highlight of the Meal and the Rest of my day - 2 Words: ORANGE BANG!!!!!  I've been searching for this Drink for the last 5 years here in Vegas and the search has finally come to an end! Yeeessss! I grew up drinking this and can't live without it! If you like \"Orange Julius\" orange blend fruit drink then you Should Fall In Love with this whipped, creamy, dreamy orange beverage.. I must of Drank a couple liters of this stuff!!  Dining in, Felt like I was in a clean restaurant in Mexico, Staff were all Extra Friendly, Quick and seemed happy to work there, Food was Excellent (some of the Best tacos I've had here in Vegas), but the tacos do come small so you may want to load up a bit.... Or A Lot!",

Now the bad- really fatty meat in the carne asada tacos; you might have a few decent bites, but eventually you're going to get a chunk of fat that you'll have try to discretely spit out in front of your friends and family. The al pastor has a bizarre too-red color that I've never seen in al pastor tacos in Mexico. I'm not sure if it's dye or something better, but I'm a little afraid of it. The line/ordering system- this is truly terrible. There are three lines for the different kinds of tacos. You can't get all three in one line and the lines are REALLY long. People shamelessly try to cut in front of you in line. Not really a pleasant experiences and the place isn't cheap.",

The tacos look a little small but they put large amounts of meat and topping so they are very filling. I love that everything is fresh as well (homemade tortillas). Its always packed so prepare of a little crowd, but the food is definitely worth it and the staff are fast and welcoming.  I love it!!!!",

THE TACOS ARE DELICIOUS and so was the quesadilla (though very overpriced... hey el gordito... si me cobras 4 dolars por una quesadilla hay que darme algo mas que un taco con queso!!)   But alex why were you tan enojado? Because this place is not worth the lines that were there. They have three lines where you order different types of tacos... what if i want carne asada and al pastor? better bring two people. The tacos are good, but they are no better than this taco place near where i live in Utah and mine cost half... thats right Billy Mays here getting you tacos for half the price and half the wait.   Having said that paragraph of complaint... if there isn't a wait i highly recommend this place, but the 45 minute wait to get a few tacos, i personally think it isnt worth it.   THE VERDICT: are they busy? go somewhere else. oh okay they arent busy, just get tacos dont buy quesadillas. Carne asada and al pastor are both pretty good and... this place is not the end all be all of tacos. But it is definitely worth trying for some delicious pina con al pastor!!",

    "text": "The food is so good! but they have a TERRIBLE LINE SYSTEM!!!   One of the best taco spots I have been to and I come from the land of taco spots.  The parking lot and area is pretty sketchy. Not one of Vegas prettiest places Inside looks exactly like King Taco but instead of spinning rotisserie chicken, they have spinning Adobada.   Again the ordering line system is terrible. They have 3 different lines for different cuts of meat. So if you want multiple types of meat, you have to stand in different long ass lines. And some people literally order 10 tacos at a time. I feel bad for the Adobada carver who has to cut those orders! After you order, you go to the register and pay. I really wonder how many people get there food and just bounce without paying.   Taco De Asada - $2 - Steak was seasoned perfectly and loaded with fresh veggies and guac.   Taco De Adobada - $2 - Pork had a very light kick, not spicy, and loaded with the same veggies and guac.   Tostada De Asada - $2 - Bascily the same as the taco but you get a crispy tortilla instead of a soft one. Next time I am going to just ask for the crispy shell on the side and get a taco.  Campechana Fries, half - $6 - Half carne and half Adobada, you get the best of both worlds! Fries were soft thin fries and loaded with cheese meat and guac. One of the best Mexican fries I have ever had.   Grilled Peppers - Free and freaking legit. Grilled soft and tender and so good!  They hide the salsa at the register so make sure you ask for a bunch when you pay. Seems like they keep that under lock and key  Honestly one of the best meals I had in Vegas. So good and so cheap. Now I want to try the SD location.",

All you Southwest and West coast folks already know the more east from home you go, it's just gets harder and harder to find the good good.  When we walked in, there is an about 15-18 foot long grill station behind a glass barrier where you watch several cooks cooking all kinds of different meats and things. A bunch of us were just standing randomly so a cook yelled out to us in Spanish to stand in one of the three lines in front of three small signs spaced down the grill area, all of which were under a huge menu running the length atop the the grill. Your meat/entree is prepared to order right there for you.  I am a homemade tortilla fiend, the lady sauteing meat was also kneading homemade tortilla dough in a bowl amongst all the grill cooking that was happening. Yes!  When your food is finished being prepared to your specific orders, your cook hands you your food over the glass barrier, you grab a tray if you are dining in, then you go over to a register and pay. You can select a beverage at that time.  Noone skipped a beat being friendly, I really felt like the Mexican establishments back in Texas I have frequented. They will speak English to you, no problem, even I was Spanglish-ing. Lol. There were ladies who were cleaning feverishly tables as soon as they became available.  We got there during a lull, but eventually the lines snaked through the entire restaurant.  More than fairly priced for the hefty serving of meat in our 2 tacos and 2 sopes.  We were completely stuffed afterwards.  Comfort Mexican food.  Love!",

Adobada I guess is a relative to al pastor or is very similar hence my love for this place.  The adobada comes off a huge rotisserie, that they carve it off the rotating piece of meat and satay the carved meat.  The tacos adobadas are topped with this spicy green sauce and pineapples [if requested].  3-4 tacos are an adequate amount for a meal and a half order or french fries with adobada is a must.  Service is excellent - Make sure you tip them!  Best times to come - After lunch and before dinner otherwise it's a madhouse.",

    "text": "I've been hearing about this place for a long while from various friends, specifically one friend. Finally decided to try it when near the area.   Super busy location. First time ive been to a restaurant like this. There are different lines for different things you want. Top favorite meat among a lot of people is the spicy pork (adobada). Then of course, you have the usual carne asada, as well as the more \"exotic\" eats like stomach, tongue, etc  Their taco's are priced pretty much around the same price ~$2/ea with exception to the tongue being $2.25  Aside from the tacos, another popular thing that was suggested were carne asada fries. Being one who has tried carne asada fries in the past from another place (Roberto's), i was eager to try these !   Adobada - spicy pork, freshly sliced off the rotating spit. Seasoned nicely. Not spicy (sadly) but still delicious  Carne Asada - Freshly cooked on the hot plate and sliced. More towards the medium  to medium well but still fairly tender. Would like a less meat temp cook but they probably use a better quality or cut of meat to produce a nice tender texture.   Pork Stomach - simmering in an unknown broth, cut upon order. Very tender and flavorful.   Beef Tongue (lengua) - same as the stomach, cut upon order. Super flavorful and tender. Tongue has a different texture than normal meat but its porous in a way to soak up some of the broth it was sitting in  Nice location, which they'd open one up on the west side of town. I believe there's one on the Strip as well.",

But since I moved to bonanza and 95N I thought I'd give it another try since I'm in the area.  They must've hired new cooks or Rita's Grill is just that much better because I was extremely dissatisfied with my food. The fries were extremely poor in quality. They tasted as though they pulled them from the freezer. And the overall amount of food in my full sized box was extremely meager. Not worth the 30$ I paid for two boxes and two drinks for my girlfriend and I. Im never coming here again.",

Just like other reviews say, make sure you wait in the correct line, we were ordering only pastor tacos so the shortest line happened to be the one we wanted.  I know i can order several street tacos so we ordered a total of 12 pastor tacos on corn tortillas and 2 drinks which came out to about under $25.  When you wait in line you order your food, hey make you your tacos fresh and you go to the next register to pay.  The restaurant is small, crowded and people will be holding tables for their friends/family but when we went outside to the outdoor overflow seating, there was no one there, it was still cold but not too bad, we were able to bear the cold, fill our bellies with pastor goodness and go on with our day.  As for the tacos themselves, very good!  Pork was marinated well, had enough flavor and spice and when topped with some lime juice and washed down with an horchata, so good!  Tacos El Gordo, your tacos are legit.",

    "text": "I had to do an update on my favorite taco spot in Vegas because of the competition that is popping up in the valley. This is my go-to spot whenever I have that taco jones a-brewing. I absolutely heart this place! I never leave here with a sad face. Why? Because their TACO ADOBADAS are the SHIZZNIT SUN!!!   There are a bunch of things on the menu, but for me, the taco adobadas are the only things I will usually order. This establishment so far is the only restaurant that serves their adobada tacos (marinated pork) Mexican Street Vendor Style. The adobadas are put onto a vertical roaster and spins continuously to keep an even roast. They're then trimmed from the spit and served on a corn tortilla. IT'S SO GANGSTER!!!  The makings that they put on it are good. They'll ask if you want everything. Everything means onions, cilantro, and an avocado sauce. You can also opt for slices of pineapple to top your tacos. The slices of pineapple will give your tacos a sour sweetness which is a plus. I do wish that their hot sauce was A TAD BIT SPICIER. I think they need to up their game in that matter. Their hot sauce may not be that spicy, but they do offer free grilled spicy peppers that you can enjoy with your meal. Definitely ask for the grilled peppers.   For some reason I think the East Charleston location tastes better than the one on the strip. Maybe I'm tripping. I also like the fact that you're in a restaurant where they give you a place to sit and have fountain drinks that you can refill. Orange Bang All Day!!!   There is great competition out there with some of the street vendors popping up in the valley, which is a really great thing. I've had tacos at these other street vendors that easily gives Tacos El Gordo a run for their money. All in all, Tacos El Gordo is still my favorite. Great service, great food, and a great atmosphere to stuff your face in.  EYE LIKA CHU PEOPLES!!!",

I got an asada one and an adobada (spicy pork). The latter is juicy shreds of pork sliced off of one of the biggest vertical kebabs I've ever seen and then drenched in a day-glow green sauce. The aguas frescas are under $2 too, and even if it's from a soda machine, we had enough to fill our Nalgenes with a jamaica and horchata mix for a post-lunch Strip amble.

    "text": "I was in the area and decided to stop by after reading @jOanne & @keith's reviews.  Good thing I read the reviews first because I walked in and immediately saw the large kitchen counter where you order....there are 3 ordering stations where you order directly from the cooks.  Since I already knew about it, I walked up like I knew what I was doing....until they started speaking to me in Spanish.....then I got a little flustered.  The menu is very simple....there are only a few things you can order and it's printed in large letters above the kitchen counter (see pics).  I decided I wanted to try the Chorizo Taco & Carne Asada Taco....and then curiosity got the best of me and I went for an order of Carne Asada Fries....they are $10 while the Tacos are $2....what does $8 more get you?  I was about to find out.  I threw $2 in a tip jar on the counter in front of the cooks and waited patiently for my order.  The food is homemade and made from scratch right in front of you....including the Tortillas.  You have to grab a tray and wait for your cook to make your order because they hand it to you right after they make it.  From there, you pay at a register on the other side of the room by the door....kind of like a Cafeteria in a Hospital or Convention Center.  My cook made me the two Tacos first and told me that he'd call my name for the Carne Asada Fries.  He asked me if I wanted everything on the Tacos...I said yes even though I had no clue what that meant....after I got the Tacos, I realized that it meant Onions, Cilantro, Guacamole, and Salsa....perfect!  I jumped right into the Chorizo Taco first....it was pretty good.  Good proportions on the toppings and the size of the Taco was decent, worth $2.  Next was the Carne Asada Taco....but before I could take a bite, the cook called my name for the Fries....when I picked it up I knew I was in trouble....the damn order of Fries was huge!  It must have weighed at least 3 to 4 lbs!  Seriously!  (see pics)  I finished off the Carne Asada Taco...which was pretty good.  The meat was fresh and cooked perfectly....it wasn't overcooked and didn't have too much fat on it.  Then I looked at the beast called Carne Asada Fries....no wonder this damn thing is $10....it can feed 4 people!  I knew there was no way I could finish it and felt bad because I was going to waste a lot of it.  I grabbed my fork and attacked it.....basically, it's French Fries (think McDonald's sized cuts) covered in Cheese, Guacamole, Carne Asada, Sour Cream, & some other kind of Cream.  The Fries were cooked just right....not too soft, not overcooked.  The flavor of the dish was awesome.  I gave it my best shot, but could barely finish just under 1/2 of the plate (see pics)....great value though....could easily feed 4 normal sized human beings.  The only gripe I had about the joint was a lack of a Salsa Bar....or Hot Sauce.....I would have loved to pour some on my food, but had to do without...that's what kept me from giving them 5 Stars.  Will I return?  Yep!  Next time, I'm bringing backup to help me with the Fries!",

    "text": "A friend introduced me to this spot and I'm so glad he did. Ever since I moved from LA about a year ago I have not been able to find anything close to the Mexican food I grew up on. And now ever since I've found this spot I'm not sure if I miss it! The one thing I've never had is an adobada taco.  And man it is amazing. The spicy pork with the salsa and sauce they add to it is just perfect. Every bite literally pulls you into the next one. I wish I had gotten 10 of them but I only got 2 so I could try other things. The carne asada tacos were good. We also had the carne asada fries which were also pretty good. But I kept on yearning for more of that Adobada. I'm hooked and plan on hooking as many other people too so that I can enjoy again and again with them. The service was cool. It was counter order and pick up but none of that matters because the 5 stars was for the food. And when the food is that good, it trumps any other reasoning.",

The guacamole was crap I couldn't believe people give this dump 5 stars. I'm from Los Angeles and I've had way better tacos at taco trucks. So if you're in Vegas don't waste your time coming here unless you like eating cold and no flavor tacos",

It's probably the cleanest taco joint I ever seen. My favorite tacos are Taco De Adobada & Taco De Lengua (spicy pork and beef tongue). Spicy pork is tender, juicy, and flavorful. Beef tongue comes in huge chunks (the most generous portion, but then again, they do cost $2.25). I always leave feeling satisfied and comforted after visiting Tacos El Gordo.",
