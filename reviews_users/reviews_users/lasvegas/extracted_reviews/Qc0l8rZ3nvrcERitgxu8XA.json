I believe my complaints are valid. Also, I failed to mention that from 1992 and 1993, I came in once to twice a week, usually ordering THE KITCHEN SINK! A good customer indeed. I also wanted to mention my girlfriend back in 1992 worked here as a waitress. She said the tips were peanuts and the kitchen had no ac...a real sweatbox! One day she was a hostess, not a waitress. She was never paid for that day. Kevin would never make good on it. He said she wasn't there that day. That was a lie as I ate there that very day. Since then (1992), almost every time I came in to eat, I mention this incident and he never has much to say. Nobody wants to work for nothing! Oh, I forgot, when I mentioned this to him originally, he asked an employee if she was there that day and she replied. \"I don't remember.\" That was a lie. I talked to her that day. Anyway, I never forgot this. As stated in my review, I had a nice 40 year run. I will never come in again! This is Larry Davis.",

She may have been new, not sure. French toast was soggy. Toast didn't arrive till 10 minutes into our meal - apparently the first batch burned. Not a huge fan of their potato chips rather than traditional breakfast potatoes. However, my mushroom, spinach and cheese omelet was off the chart. Huge, hot and tasty. The ham and eggs my husband got were standard fare. If you go, get the omelet for sure.",

On our way to the back of their place we walked past 3 empty tables and the front of the restaurant was really nice and full of Caucasian people.

Another woman came to grab the payment and had us sign . We then proceeded to leave ! After leaving this restaurant I was chased out of the door. The manager said we did not pay . Wow . What a mess . I explained my concerns about the establishment and left . I am completely outraged at the lack of communication amongst the staff working at this restaurant and I will NEVER return .

Pancakes are sooo fluffy I could die! They are basically delicious, golden pillows of perfection. I also ordered \"The Californian\" Omelette which was HUGE and loaded with sausage, fresh avocado and yummy melted jack cheese. Served with tasty chips AND your choice of banana bread/pumpkin bread/ toast :) It was so huge, I shared and still took half of it home.

When I got my food, I noticed the potatoes were actually potato chips. This was rather surprising to me. When I brought it to the waiter's attention, he told me that those were the only kind of potatoes served there. He graciously gave me something else in exchange.  The second time I came, I asked about the potato situation. I was told that everyone else loves the potato chips, but that I could ask that they not be cooked until they are crispy. I may try that some time, or else just stick to the other sides. All in all, a great place to eat.",

Would recommend doing the \"baby\" size- the name is totally wrong, it's still a huge omelet! Also of note, their omelets come with fresh, seasoned potato chips- which are really delicious and I'd highly recommend- but, I suppose, that's not for everyone and they do have alternatives. Overall, I definitely do like this place a lot. It's never going to be a super trendy brunch spot and it's not trying to be; this is the type of place you go with family or friends to relax and catch-up- it's super friendly, quiet, and delicious.",

Actual chunks of chicken fried steak in an omelet that had to have a half dozen eggs in it and, smothered in a country gravy-like substance to boot!  Damn the triglycerides, I'm finishing it!

The homemade potato slices are a bit on the salty side, but that's to be expected. There's a wide variety in of omelettes on the menu with a dish for anyone.

For people who complain about the size of the omelette if you read the menu you can order the smaller version instead critics cry it's so massive lol whatever! The potatoes did change they used to be very greasy and softer now they're more of a potato chip but thicker and not as greasy as they used to be. The coffee is on point along with the banana bread, never ate a bad meal here.",

Side note, the owner is a gentleman. Myself and three friends were standing outside after our meal waiting for a cab to take us a short distance away. We were late for a conference.

Great seasoning, not too much cheese, and just the right amount of filling, too.  Those breakfast potatoes are heavenly--I couldn't get enough!

Reasonable priced and very good food. The restaurant isn't in the best area but the facility and set up was gorgeous and roomy. Our family was so surprised to see the number of customers, just to prove that place is popular and good.",

    "text": "This place is located in a run down little strip mall and isn't much to look at from the outside. It's one of those places I would never have gone to unless someone had recommended it to me first. That would be Yelp, in this case. I'm glad I found it, though, because the breakfast here is great.  Their omelettes are gigantic! No one in my group was able to finish theirs. I had the Black Forrest omelette which had mushrooms, ham, and swiss. The eggs were perfect and the cheese was nice and melty. But it was just too big. I should have exercised the option to make it a \"baby omelette\" for $0.85 less. I had considered the option, but decided it would make me look like a wuss. I didn't want to order something off the menu with the word \"baby\" in it. That's worse than ordering off the kid's menu, as far as I'm concerned.  There's one thing that troubled me. There's one omelette on the menu called the \"Flatlanders Special.\" This is what it is word for word from the menu: Raw liver, parsnips, peanut butter, organically grown black jelly beans, sauteed grunion lips (2), gardenia petals, and topped with mint ice cream (Subject to when grunions are running). It costs $69. I don't know if it's for real or if it's some kind of joke. Thinking about it now, I'm really kind of curious about it.   That aside, this place is great. Definitely check it out when you're in town. Oh, and don't leave without trying the banana nut bread or the pumpkin bread. Or both.",

    "text": "Omelet House is one of our favorite Vegas finds - we stopped at one of their other locations on a past trip out to take some pictures at the Hoover Dam, and they were the Yelp suggestion for a good local breakfast. We were thrilled to find another location with the same great menu right in town, and visited twice on our last trip.  I'm particularly fond of the green chile sauce, whether it be in the pork chili verde omelet or just on the side. D has alternated between breakfast food and the lunch special sandwiches, and we both really love the breakfast potatoes. They're unevenly cut, which means a perfect blend of crispy thin slices and tender thicker ones.  Service is friendly and prompt, and we feel great about having a flavorful local meal instead of overpriced and underflavored hotel breakfast.",

No list to put your name in, just old fashion standing in line. It works fabulously. Like I said, less than 20 minutes, from the parking lot to our table. The owner is hands on, and keeps his team running like a well oiled machine. Everyone who helped us was amazing. Not to mention every bite was melt in your mouth delicious. I had the Lobster Omelette and my husband had the Lobster Eggs Benedict, we also ordered a half sized biscuits and gravy. As a bonus the banana nut bread is served warm and with a scoop of butter on the side. Yum!!",

The servers are extremely friendly here, again making you feel as if grandma is serving you. I overheard plenty of warm conversations between servers and locals, so heart-warming.

Wait for drinks was kind of long. Ordered our breakfast. I asked what came with the meals. Told \"spuds\". I thought it would be home fries or breakfast potatoes. I was surprised when my plate had my eggs and a giant pile of potato chips. I don't really like potato chips for breakfast and don't remember getting them on my previous visit. Needless to say, I was not impressed. I didn't question the chips because everyone had them. I should have but didn't. Maybe they didn't get their potato order and substituted chips. Someone should have gone to Smith's right around the corner and bought some if that is the case. I told my husband to be careful about how much he ordered because the omelettes are huge. His looked like the ones I make for him at home. A simple 3 egg omelette. Claims to be 6 eggs. I don't think so. Our server was nice. I never blame the wait staff over issues like this. The quantity is dependent on the manager. It seems management is ok with how it's going. We won't be back again. The hunt for a decent breakfast spot continues.",

A few years ago we at at the Henderson location, and I have been dreaming of their Lobster Eggs Benedict ever since. So while here for a quick trip, it was on the top of my list of places to dine. Needless to say, I was not disappointed!   It all starts with the service. The staff(from hostess to waitstaff) were so friendly and welcoming(congrats to Loni's son that just got married). They were not just trying to feed us and turn the table, they actually took the time to chat and make us feel \"at home\"(not many places in Las Vegas do that). They coffee was just what I needed to wake me up, but was not punch you in the gut strong like so many of the chain coffee places. The portions are huge, so if you're really hungry, go ahead and indulge, but know that you can easily share. My hubby had Californian omelette, and loved it(insider's tip: order the baby size...it's only three eggs). All the egg entree's come with homemade potato chips(more please!)  I saved the best for last: the Lobster Eggs Benedict. Loaded with chunks....yes chunks, of lobster and topped with homemade hollandaise sauce. The eggs were cooked to perfection! It was worth jumping off the diet train and indulging. Again, this was accompanied by the those delicious homemade potato chips.   The kids had pancakes and sides of bacon and ate every bite. This is our new go to breakfast place when in town.",

My dad had the short stack of pancakes and loved them.  Our waitress Cece was so nice and we loved chatting with her. This place is the real deal. Authentic and home cooked food! If you're in Vegas come here for breakfast. Worth the drive from the strip :)",

Any given morning, you can find blue collar workman, attorneys in suits or simply locals sitting beside one another enjoying breakfast.    Ambiance is outdated, but kind of goes with the old school feel.  Warn carpet, marinated fake leather booths, bad wood paneling about, convention sale like metal chairs, chachkies and trinkets kind of collecting dust all over the walls and for sale in their front entrance display case.  There is an extensive menu of omelets and surely something for everyone's omelet tastes.  Omelets are large and I would said simply OK.  Maybe a touch greasy.  They are served with \"homemade chips\" or you can substitute another side (some at an upcharge).   You also get a bread option with your breakfast.     Waitresses are old school, just like the venue.  Kind, welcoming, low key, local, many have been serving up Las Vegas locals for a very long time.    I like Las Vegas old school, so don't let the 3 stars insinuate that I would not be back, for I would.",

Most plates come with banana or pumpkin bread. I liked the banana, but the pumpkin was too spicy for me. Not a big fan of pumpkin anyway. Their omelettes come with 6 eggs, if you want half order they reduce $1. The restaurant is dated but looked clean. Not a big fan of carpet in restaurants because it can get dingy like the one here.

I admit the place looked questionable from the outside, you'd never know it was a great restaurant. And when you enter, your taken back by all the novelties decorated on the walls, but I must stay the food and service is great. I had the country fried steak and eggs, and it was the best Ive ever had. The second time I went with my boyfriend and we had the pleasure of the owner actually serving us. He and his staff always showed some of the best service we ever received. Next time you visit Las Vegas, save your money from one of those high priced  hotel buffets and go here. You wont be disappointed!!",

The last two times we were there, we were eating next to people who had brought their dog. These dogs were NOT service dogs. If I wanted to eat with animals, I'd take my lunch to the pound. I love dogs, but there is a time and place for them. I also don't want to sit where a dog has been. I'm allergic and don't want dog hair on me. Also, and maybe most important, is that it's against the law to take a dog, other than service, into a place that serves or sells food. I don't think we will go back. I'm sorry, because we have been going there for years. How about a \"no dogs allowed without service papers\" on the door.",

I think this just might be the best mom and pop place that I've been to. The inside sorta makes you feel like you're at grandma's house with all the little knick-knacks (is that a word?) and vintage posters.  The service is alright. I would say it's a hit or miss because sometimes they make me feel so welcome and are really engaging and other times its just standard, not bad though.   The omelets come with bread. Don't get the toast, GET THE PUMPKIN OR BANANA BREAD. I LOVVEE the pumpkin bread so I usually get that. Its totally tastes homemade, straight out of the oven good. Mmm    There's no one specific omelet I always get but everything I've had here has all been really good. The omelets are ridiculously huge and for pretty cheap too, so you might wanna share with someone, which they'll conveniently do for you for a small fee. The potato chips that come with the omelets are homemade too, which you can taste. Sooo yummy and fresh.  I've just recently got discovered eggs benedict (i know, what??) and this place has amazinngggg lobster eggs benedict!!! mmmm  I haven't found an equal to this place back in orange county so I can only get this yummy breakfast on my trips out here :[ I guess that gives me more of a reason to come back? ahhaha",

    "text": "An amazing place for breakfast. Tucked away in the back of a u-shaped shopping center, it's a good thing the large sign was out on the street. Don't be put off by the outside of the building. Go on in and transport yourself back a few years. The place is huge and just goes on and on. We ordered the omelet to share (at the suggestion of Kathy, our server). She was outstanding! The omelet was made with SIX eggs and was cooked perfectly. There is a small charge for splitting the plate but it's worth it to each get your own side of potatoes (think homemade potato chips) and a side of bread. I had the sourdough toast and she had the pumpkin bread. The pumpkin bread was a large thick piece that she loved. The next time we visit Vegas, we will definitely have breakfast here at least once.",

At first I was a little skeptical, but wow this place was delicious and the staff was very friendly! The proportions are huge! I ate the best pancakes I've ever had, no syrup needed. Overall, the next time I'm in Vegas, the Omelet House will be #1 on my list!",

    "text": "This is a locals breakfast joint.  It's been around forever, and hasn't be redecorated since the mid-70's.   The servers are mostly older, and have probably been working there since the place opened.  The decor and the service is 'Meh'.  This isn't a Strip restaurant.  It's a small hole-in-the-wall place in the middle of a strip mall.  They are not trying to impress you.    BUT, the omelets are really good!  5-eggs, in every possible combination you can think of.  The potatoes are like thick chips and SOOOO yummy.  The plates are huge: I'm a big guy, and even I can't finish a full plate.  If you can deal with the servers, the wait, and the decor, the end result is really worth it!  Place is kid friendly, but large groups are probably going to have to wait a while...like I said, it's a small place with a few room extensions.  Every friend I've brought to this place has become a fan and returned on their own.  That should tell you something.  =)  If you did the drive to Vegas, and it's your last day, I would totally recommend this place as your last stop before you hit the long road back to LA.",

I love taking people here who haven't been which is usually someone who has moved here from somewhere else because what True native hasn't eaten here?! When family comes to town this is my go-to place to go out for breakfast.  I can't go and not get an order of \"Fried Zucchini Sticks\". They are the best I have ever had! They come in a half or full order and you can get cheese sauce or ranch or both for dipping. If you haven't tried them yet please do! I always get the \"Green Hornet\". It has avocado and cheese and tomatoes. I am notorious for it and just can't change it but do take a bite off my families plates hehe!  Just so you know, the omelets are made with 6 eggs so if you don't think you can eat that much you can just ask for a \"baby\" and they will make it with 3 eggs. They also give you a little off the cost for using less eggs I think it is like 75 cents or something. The spuds are so good too. I usually ask for them with no salt and love to dip them in ranch dressing.  The lines can be long but you don't wait for long and the wait is more then worth it! This last visit we waited maybe 5 minutes. They are only open for breakfast & lunch. During the week it isn't as hectic as trying to eat at Omelet House on the weekends but still consistent.",

She recommended stuff to us since it was our first time. The pumpkin bread was warm and tasted like Fall. Chili was delicious. We got it with cheese and onions. The garlic bread was crispy and chewy with one side having caramelized cheese. It was PERFECT. The omelet was delicious and ginormous. I took 80% of it home because we ordered so much food. The boyfriend said the pastrami sandwich was delicious and came out piping hot. First time here and it was super freaking awesome.   Don't be put off by the exterior condition of the place. I'm not going to lie.... The interior could use a little revamping. It essentially looks like how I would imagine grandmas house with knick knacks that she's collected over the years. It's pretty neat and the restaurant is a lot bigger than I expected it to be. Anyways will definitely try to get my boyfriend to take me here again!!!!!",

I love the cheesy, homey decor that is comforting like you're going to grandma's house to eat!  First thing first, whatever you get - get it with SPUDS.  I'm a potato lover and these are the best fried potatoes I've had anywhere! If you want an appetizer to share - go with the FRIED ZUCCHINI - omg good!  Half order is good for 2-3 people, get the cheese AND ranch.   Next, unless you are starving - order your OMELET \"baby size\".  They come out in generous portions.  There are so many options on the omelet - I like the California, BB&C and Farmer's.  Surprisingly however this is my favorite place to order CHICKEN FINGERS! The tenders are thin and not \"bready\".  I throw some RED HOT on them and they are the best!    Oh and the PATTY MELT on the evenly toasted bread.. SO many yummy options to choose from at Omelet House - you can't go wrong!..",

Like most places off the strip, the price is very reasonable and the portions are big.  we ended up ordering waffles with eggs and sausage, and the vegetable omelet with added ham.  as there preparing the food the server will give you hot fresh banana bread to munch on.  food came out nice and hot, full flavored and fresh ingredients.  the omelet was so large we had to take it home to go.  they have a wide variety of items, pretty typical breakfast and brunch items such as big breakfasts, pancakes, and eggs Benedict.   if i ever go back i would like to try to the eggs benedict.  great prices, large portions, friendly staff, overall great destination for an off the strip place for breakfast at a reasonable price.",

It was tasty and very generous with the amount of meat, not spicy, but that's ok. My husband loves chicken fried steak, and he said this was one of the better CFS he's had. The gravy was very good. Now the service was great. We had Shirley and she was so cute, made me miss my grandma. Even though she was older she was quick, attentive, and talkative at the same time.  We were able to walk in get seated but do be prepared for a wait if you go on a weekend. The location is a little sketchy, but it turned out ok.",

The omelet was cooked well. It wasn't overcooked like most places that attempt to make an omelet. Each omelet meal comes with a side of their addictive potatoes. They are more like potato chips. Deep fried potatoes goodness. The meals also comes with a choice of toast or their homemade pumpkin nut bread. The pumpkin nut bread is a must. It's warm and spongy. Not overly sweet, just the right amount of sweetness and spices. The decor is interesting to say the least; Wild West with the great outdoor theme. Service was a bit slow, but workers acknowledge it. I would definitely come back.",

    "text": "Walk in hungry, walk out with a massive food coma.  Omelet House is a local chain with this since-1979 spot near UMC serving as its flagship. After seeing the line when I arrived and the longer out-the-door line when I left, I was thankful that my friends had arrived early to grab a table. Also, the layout is a bit clunky and labyrinthine but I suppose that's part of the old-school charm (along with the framed art and whatnot). I was fortunate that a server noticed my confused wandering and directed me to the rear dining room, where I found the table fairly easily.  Having last been to Omelet House a few years back (around the time during which I penned what would become one of my ROTDs), I forgot just how huge the portions are. Even the baby omelets look hefty, but I got a full-sized #39 Chicken Fried Steak omelet ($11.79) and ended up taking over half of it to-go. The omelet gets a bit dry toward the outside, but jack cheese and sausage gravy more than make up for this. I was a bit confused by my difficulty in locating chicken fried steak and decided that they'd either pounded it unnaturally thin or else used a corned beef paste (a la hash) instead, but the flavors were great overall, with no additional seasoning needed.  Out of the included-with-breakfast-entree sides, pumpkin bread was an easy choice because it had the most seasonal appeal. I did find it a little dry and had to use the vegetable oil spread (no butter, really?), and I think I would've been better served to listen to my old review and order the banana nut bread instead. Also, thick potato chips came with the entree, but they were mostly not crispy enough for my liking. I don't need them as crispy as the mass-produced packaged stuff, but most of the pieces were soft if not soggy  I also had a few pieces of Fried Zucchini ($8.89 full portion) thanks to Christie L. I could've used a more crispy texture on the batter, but I liked the juicy slices of zucchini inside. They weren't overly salty or greasy, and they went well with the dipping sauces (ranch or nacho cheese).  Considering that I did enjoy my overall meal quite a bit, I still have to give a stamp of approval to this location of Omelet House. It's a good value for simple, comforting breakfast.",

There was a line at the door of maybe 10 people waiting to be seated in front of us and the owner/manager came out and said it'd be less than 15 minutes or else free meal to the couple behind us. The line moved quickly and we were seated in like 5 minutes. There is a lot on the menu to pick from; probably like 30 different omelets to choose from. The food was very good. Pancakes were delicious. Would come back.",

To be honest I was going to go to eggslut but I had a what evers impression of the one in California and there was a long wait. In my opinion, I think eggslut is over rated and not worth the wait. I don't want to spend my time waiting in line for an hour for something I'm not too excited over when I can go to someplace new and possibly more yummy. I'm glad I tried this place because it's delicious! I'm usually not a fan of omelets cause a lot of places make it really dry. But not this place. This place made it deliciously juicy and they even have their own chips which was also super yummy. Their service is amazing and they pay attention to their customers. Also I got seated almost immediately after walking in. I'm glad I came here over eggslut. It saved so much of my time and it's super filling. I even had left overs when I left. If I had gone to eggslut, the amount of money I would have wasted on a meal here wouldn't have even gotten me full. I would definitely recommend this place and would come back when ever I'm in the Vegas area.",

Within minutes we had our drinks and shortly after that food was on it's way.

I was a little intimidated at the fact that they do not have hash brown, but that didn't keep me away. our order consisted of: -Popeye Omelet- spinach, mushrooms and cheese -Cowboy- chili -Carnitas- Well pork for you that don't speak ESPANOL  -Everything but the kitchen sink- Literally EVERYTHING it was HUGE!!  They have the sharing charge. I do suggest this option if you do not eat alot since their portions are RIDICULOUSLY BIG.   We were all very satisfied. My only complaint on my omelet was the chili was a little watery. There was an accumulation of water in my plate, not a major factor but I do like my Chili on the thicker side.   Your meal comes with a complimentary side of bread, we all got pumpkin spice.   Overall it was Delicious!!!! ! can't wait to go back and visit my sister to have breakfast here.

Omelets your way...and they are huge and flavorful. The home fried potatoes that compliment your omelette are good, though they pale in comparison to the omelette. Oh, and the banana or pumpkin bread that come with your meal is delicious, as in better than your grandma's (if your grandma could really cook). I got an omelet with shrimp, crab, avocado, and cream cheese with egg whites and it simply blew my taste buds away. Fresh, hot coffee and they keep your cup full!  Old school feel by the ambiance of the place...very homey, rustic and charming. The service was amazing!

The place was very nice, very clean a little hard to find, if you missed the sign, you would miss it.  Not sure if we are in town again that we would go back.",

My husband ordered the \"Lobster fest Omelet\" which had chunks of real lobster, avocado, and jack cheese. Both omelets were absolutely delicious, filling, and very huge!

Little hole-in-the-wall places that have been doing their thing for decades. Long list of omelets with silly names and unapologetically dated decor with knotty pine walls. Not far from the glitz of the Strip, we found people of all ages from bikers to college kids tucking into piles of food. It felt like a glimpse of the real Vegas.  Their standard 'O-Boy Omelets' are made with SIX EGGS! Totally insane. We ordered 'Baby Omelets' made with three eggs for a little bit less money since there is no point having leftovers when you're on vacation. For choice of bread, my favorite was the pumpkin bread served piping hot. The thinly sliced side of potatoes were on the verge of being potato chips and just as addictive.  I enjoyed The Guac, but had plate envy after I tasted Mr. K's Cowboy Special (chili, cheese and onions) and kept going back for more. This isn't the best place in the world, but I am tempted to give it five stars because it is just what the doctor ordered. But, the coffee is weak (even though the refills were plentiful) and I've had better versions of this style of cooking elsewhere. Still, damn fine.",

Was able to find a spot next to the old lady walking in with a white and baby blue colored cane wrapped in plastic vines and flowers.   OMG this place is going to be amazing!  They don't take reservations, its first come first serve. There was a crowd of 10 ahead of our party of two. I thought about backing out but the pictures of the old celebrities charmed me back in.   The wood paneling and retro carpet kept my head on swivel and eyes dancing around the place. Curio cabinets, dishes, trinkets, grandmas house decor multiplied by a thousand! The heavy set patron sitting at the bench was equally attired for the place and when I asked her about the food, she rolled her eyes and said, \"please\". So we waited and got to the end of the line quickly (about 10 minutes) to come face to face with 3 state fair coin machines. Test your grip, your love it your athletics. I apparently I have a Wimpy Grip.   We were shown to our table that included a mini tour through the kitchen (which was spotless) to our booth. Lovely enough and situated in a well ventilated large room with enough seating for a company of Marines! What an experience!  The diverse patrons, the on point staff, the eclectic decor make this place a MUST.   The food ..... I'm rolling my eyes. Delicious. I had a number 39.",

It's nothing fancy but very homey and cozy like you are at your grandparents house for Sunday brunch! Staff is extremely friendly and sweet.

And they have chips as the side order that comes with it and that was crispy and tasted freshly made. I could eat those chips and banana bread all day. I'm definitely considering seeing if they sell a loaf of their banana bread. I also tried the pumpkin bread which is amazing as well but it wasn't as flavorful and tasty as the banana bread. Two people can definitely share one omelette. The lox eggs Benedict was also a huge portion. The salmon was actually cooked which took me by surprise because I'm used to a lox bagel with a raw smoked salmon instead of a cooked one but regardless it was still good. The sauce wasn't overwhelming or anything. The display of my eggs Benedict  was pretty funny. They put a black olive on each egg so it looked like boobs. I'd definitely come back! There are so many different omelettes on the menu to try.",

The young man who greeted us was a little rude scolding us for not waiting to seated however the \"sign\" telling us why to do was not out so we sat ourselves. Anyway.....so worth it, the waitress Valerie was so attentive, she was  training new waitress so she was trying to please us and her trainee, she did marvellous. I had a cheese omelette, my husband had polish sausage omelette...the potatoes that come with breakfast are hardto describe but so very yummy. Their banana bread is so good we ordered some to go. This place is the real deal breakfast! Highly recommend this place!",

Gf and i had omelets - big surprise - she went with the veggie, i went with the porky pig - i'm guessing 5-10 eggs in each , a seriously huge omelet - we didn't eat 1/2 of it - hope it keeps for tomorrow's bk.   comes with potatoes that closely resemble potato chips. tried the banana bread and the pumpkin bread ( more like cake )   tried a bite of each - very good.   Overall, just ok by me - like the old school feel to the place, but after a couple bites of the omelet just felt like it was lacking much flavor - my guess is they used farmer john skinless links for the filling - not much of the lil buggers either.   total cost with coffee , $22 so it ain't exactly cheap eats , sure i can take 1/2 our order home but i doubt it's like day old spaghetti, pizza, and the like.   and yes, at Scott's directive, I took some pics with my cell phone but the banana bread looks more like meatloaf then bread !!   happy eating",

    "text": "My wife and I went for breakfast the other day. We had been to The Omelet House a few years ago and decided to go again. I am not a big breakfast person so I decided to have the Grilled Ham & Cheese sandwich. My wife ordered one of their six egg omelets. My sandwich was very tasty. I did also enjoy the potatoes that came with it. They are sliced like potato chips, but not cooked to a hard crunch. They are soft and crunchy at the same time. My wife said her omelet was quite tasty as well.  I am sorry to say that in the long run I was not very impressed. When we arrived we waited to be seated a good three to five minutes. The restaurant was only about half full at the time. Once seated we also had to wait to have anyone come by and get our drink order. That was almost ten minutes. I don't know what kind of tea they serve, but my tea had a strange taste to it. My wife ordered sourdough toast with her omelet. When it arrived I was drenched in margarine to the point she had to send it back and ask for it dry. My sandwich, even though tasty, was priced way too high. The slices of bread were not very big, the ham was not very thick and the cost was close to eight dollars.  I have to say that our server was friendly and did the best she could. The food was pretty good but overpriced. All in all it is just an ok place to go. I can't say about the other locations. I ate at the Charleston location. Maybe the others are better.",

If you're an omelet enthusiast like myself, this place is heaven.  Since eggs are the best thing you can eat for a hangover (they soak up the toxins of alcohol) I was thoroughly satisfied with the ginormous omelet they gave me. I believe I had the chili verde omelet. You can order a small one if you can't handle the savage sized ones (only $10).  Everyone raves about this pumpkin bread and the verdict: it's pretty good. Not anything to say OMG about but definitely should get it since it's an option other than toast.  Not really a fan of the potato chip style spuds that come with the dish.  Good bang for your buck!",

When you come back, and you will, try the hamburger they are also really good! The atmosphere is engaging as there is a lot of things to look at and quite a few big names have been through there and left a picture.

I ordered the Eggs Benedict Florentine. The hollandaise sauce was the best I've ever had, and it went well with the spinach and mushrooms. The potato chips were awesome too...slightly crispy on the edges and soft in the center. The other guys ordered omelettes, which they seemed to enjoy too.

We stopped in on our way out of town for both visits, and it really was some of the best food and service for both, too.  The first time I ate here, I ordered corned beef hash, which came with eggs and potatoes if I remember correctly, and I got one of their sweet baked breads instead of toast. DELICIOUS! I also ordered a side of pancakes and split them with one of the people I was with - actually, come to think of it, I remember giving him a decent sized portion of all of my food. They don't skimp on things, let me tell you!  The second time I ate at this delicious restaurant, I tried the Eggs Benedict Lobster - SO WONDERFUL! The hollandaise isn't too rich, which I really appreciated. I rarely every enjoy hollandaise, unless I've made it myself - theirs complimented the flavor of the lobster. The eggs were done perfectly, the potatoes were delicious, and there were actual chunks of lobster. I really enjoyed my breakfast.  Speaking specifically about the second visit, myself, my partner, and our best friend were traveling. We ate at NUMEROUS places during our 4-day stay in Vegas (even a restaurant that ended up having a film crew there from the travel channel WHILE we were dining there!), and I must say, the service here blew every other place out of the water. Before eating here, we were all talking amongst ourselves about how absolutely horrendous all of our customer service experiences had been at almost every single place we'd dined at. Say we ate at 8 places - only two of them were nice, and one of those two was better than nice (guess what - it was Omelet House).  Also, it should be noted that both times we stopped in, they were pretty busy - and yet we were sat pretty much immediately.  If we go to Las Vegas again, this place will be on our breakfast list, for sure.",

What the heck I don't want to eat chips for breakfast! Don't get me wrong the chips are good, they would just be better for lunch with a sandwich or something. Not a bad place though.",

    "text": "Our dining group had a positive overall experience here.  The interior is unique and the down home dinerish feel that makes going to breakfast places enjoyable.  Plenty of seating to be had.  The service was excellent and coffee and water cups were filled frequently and without even being asked.  I had the chicken fried steak with country gravy and the homemade house chips.  The dish was accompanied by pumpkin bread.  The pumpkin bread  was plentifully apportioned and served with spreadable butter versus the normal hard butter.  The homemade chips were crisp and delicious.  Chicken friend steak is one of my guilty pleasures and this version of it was one of the better ones I've had, best version in Las Vegas.  One of our dinner patrons had one of the omelets and found it underwhelming.  I won't speak as to the omelet as I didn't have it.  Breakfast food is a hard market to set yourself apart in a positive direction from the pack.  My experience was a solid four and I would like to come back and try some of the other dishes.",

    "text": "My husband I went there for the first time a couple of days ago and I ordered the sausage and cheese omelet ( I think it's the porky pig or something like that)) and my husband ordered the French toast. The French toast came with 2 eggs, done perfectly, and bacon. It was your standard french toast like you would make at home but it was delicious and like I said, the eggs were done perfectly. The omelet I ordered was stuffed with sausage and cheese. Delicious!!! It came with these thick cut \"potato chip\" type potatoes that I surprisingly really liked ( I'm a hash brown kinda girl). The BEST part of our meal though was our waitress Shirley!!! She was the sweetest, cutest lady ever!!! She said she's been there for 15 years and everyone knew her and would grab her to say hello. I'm gonna ask for her section every time I go from now on. Adorable!! She really made the place and made you overlook the old, dusty, fake plastic plant decor. Lol. So In summation, I would definitely recommend this place if you're looking for a really good omelet. If you're looking for gourmet, fancy breakfast dishes you won't find it here but they do have eggs Benedict too. The selection of omelets was vast. 2 thumbs up!!",

    "text": "This is favorite breakfast spot when we are in Vegas. It is a local place that is always busy.  The biscuits and gravy are homemade and so good, they are a must here.  Our table shared a plate while we all decided what to order.  Nothing says breakfast can't have an appetizer too.    Today I had the scramble, eggs with large ham chunks and onions, very tasty.  The others had omelets and are stuffed with all the goodies they like (although I don't think I would ever like an omelet with asparagus and mushrooms but that's just me).   Each plate comes with their home potatoes which are thinly sliced like homemade potato chips but not fried to a crisp.  If your throwing caution to the wind, ask for a side of cheese sauce, it is a wonderful combination.  They have homemade soups so we ordered the ham and bean soup to go.  That will be our post night out gimme something to eat food.  I cant wait.  The service was friendly and our drinks were constantly topped off.  Family and kid friendly.  It is very plain on the outside and I likely would never have tried it if I wasn't with someone that already had.  The inside looks like my grandma decorated it but that is all part of the local, mom and pop place charm.  The biscuits and gravy make it all worth it.",

Second . . . the food was luke warm, tasteless, and very disappointing.  Order the biscuits and gravy with a side of extra biscuits . . . while the first biscuit was great, the side biscuits looked, tasted, and the texture of dinner rolls.

The height of the omelet alone is just shy of an inch! They super fill the omlet as well, I don't think this meal is made for a normal person. I also love how they do the potatoes!  I wanted sausage and biscuits and regret not ordering an omelet.  The gravy was pretty weak and lacked in flavor. (-1 star)  The staff were super nice and welcoming.  The place is pretty packed with regulars and not many tourists (like our group).  If you drove to LV, or willing to cab it, I'd say its more than worth it!",

Breakfast prices in our Las Vegas strip hotel were crazy inflated for the poor quality meals that  were available.   After reading other rave reviews of the Omelet House we had to try it.   Easy to find and plenty of parking in the small strip mall.   We knew we made the right decision when we walked in with some locals who commented \"wow no line today\".     Walking into the restaurant was like. Being transported back 50 years in time.  The decor was cheesy 50's.   Ceramic nick naks  were everywhere.     Service was over the top and the food was delicious.   It was impossible to drink more than 1/2 a cup of coffee before it was refilled.   My wife and I shared an omelet and a fruit plate and could not finish them because the portions were so large.    This will be our go to breakfast restaurant next time we visit Las Vegas although it's a short drive from the Strip.     Right on Yelp",

I definitely thought there would be a wait but We were given a table immediately. It is a huge menu, obviously featuring omelets. There was about 30 omelets to choose from and a bunch of other breakfast options. The portions are enormous and there was maybe one healthy thing on the menu so I wouldn't suggest coming here if you're dieting. I got an omelet with chorizo, cheese and onions. Each entree comes with spuds which are basically potato chips. Wasn't sure how I felt about them at first but they grew on me. Could barely finish half of my omelet and should have gotten the baby size which is 1$ less. The restaurant is filled with random knick knacks and interesting collectible items. The staff was very sweet and attentive. Highly recommend.",

I had their lobster egg benedict with home made potato chips and ALOT of coffee. The lobster benny was pretty good. The potato chips are my favorite, crunchy on the outside and soft on the inside, YUM! My friends ordered different variations of the omelets and were all pleased.  Omelets come with potato chips and pumpkin/banana nut bread or toast. The restaurant serves up about 40 different omelets, even the pickiest people (I know a few) are bound to find a combination they like. They also offer sandwiches, hamburgers, soups, etc. Solid breakfast, lunch place.",

    "text": "#27 LOBSTER FEST  It sadness me to post this review. I've came several times to eat here all the way from Los Angeles. Never had any issues and never met the actual owner until today. And he was of no help to us. He tried to make us feel that we were stupid about his #27. Lobster fest \"real lobster \" omelette when we brought it to his attention that the omelette didn't have any \" lobster \" in the omelette just some circle imitation crab looking things. His excuse was that it was the first \"ingredient \" on the list of the \"ocean tofu \" pack he uses. He even brought out the packaging to show it telling us we couldn't expect actual shelled lobster. Never the less kept putting his voice up not letting us speak. Don't not offer something on ur menu that you aren't actually going to provide and try to fool your customers and not even offer to comp them for it when there dissatisfied with it. He still charged us full price for it. Which wasn't the point just don't try to take your costumers as fools. He needs to take his self a trip down to Puerto Nuevo in Baja California Mexico so he can see how real lobster actually looks and taste SMH",

Impressive service, multiple people asking can I get you anything else? Can I refill your drink? May I take that? Polite and the owner is around usually asking people where they want to seat and they honestly say what the wait will be and he will help you get seated quickly. I never once was upset about anything. Oh and go when you are hungry because you will not leave hungry at all.",

Fun side note, this is the location seen on \"Comedians in Cars Getting Coffee\" with Jerry Seinfeld and Jerry Lewis.  Food Review:  Pancakes were some of the best pancakes I've had, fluffy, big, great texture. I also had the Carnitas Omelet.  The omelet was huge! And very good. Came with a side of potato \"chips.\" Coffee was good yummy diner coffee. Plenty of choices to choose from, you will find something.  Interior:  A perfect no nonsense spot for a hearty breakfast.   $35 two people with way too much food left over. PLENTY of food! You pay at table, check picked up and delivered quickly at end of meal.  I will definitely recommend and return myself.",

Been feeding Las Vegas for 30 years. I was in the area and decided to go and have nice breakfast before work. Ordered the Bennie Segal Omelet. Packed with Italian beef Sour cream peppers piled high. The omelet was superb. Portion was enormous. If your visiting don't miss out close enough to the strip to visit. If you're local this place needs to be on your list. Vintage Vegas gem.",

    "text": "EEEE. I have a \"love/not so much love\" relationship with Omelet House. Its kitschy decor and friendly service remind me of family reunions in the Midwest. Lovely to visit, but I know when it's time to head back to the city.   The food is just a tad too heavy for me here. Large portions of greasy and salty breakfast foods are great for those mornings after a long night. I do love a nice greasy plate of eggs and pancakes from time to time. However, for a go-to breakfast spot, I would likely choose a place that places more focus on fresher/healthier options.   I've had various menu items over the years. Their pancakes are large and fluffy, and their omelettes certainly share those similar characteristics. Recently, I ordered a Benedict, and this may not be one of their specialties. The hollandaise smothered the eggs, it was creamy and had a somewhat bland taste to it. The sauce overtook the flavoring of the meal overall. Their bread loaves are amazing! The pumpkin bread comes out warm and is delicious when layered with butter.   For me, the thing that holds this place together is nostalgia and hangovers. Good for moments in time but maybe not a regular choice.",

I also saw the manager compliment this guy on how amazing of a person that guys wife was haha.  Service was amazing. I never saw the bottom of my cup of of coffee and never had to ask for a refill because they were on top of it.   I ordered the homemade corned beef hash and eggs. On their menu it says \"best you ever had\". That is 100% accurate lol. Literally the BEST corned beef hash I've ever had. This place is going to be a tradition every time I go to Vegas. Every plate comes with homemade potato chips too!  My friend ordered their vegetarian omelette which was almost the size of a football lol she finished half and loved it. You can also opt in to get the smaller portion for a dollar less.",

You will see regulars/family in here hugging and talking to the staff all the time.  It has a real down to earth feel and family owned vibe.  But you want food!  So is the food that good??  Happy to say it is!  We have come here multiple times...tried quite a bit of the menu.  Where they really shine is...you guessed it...the omelets!  We have tried multiple omelets, but my favorites by far are the LOBSTER omelet and the CHORIZO omelet!  The lobster is made with real chunks of lobster, and it is so light and fluffy, it goes down too easy and doesn't hold you down like a heavy meat and bacon omelet.  Super satisfying and awesome flavor though!  The chorizo is the opposite...super heavy and oily like chorizo should be...so much flavor and delicious going on in every bite.  By the way, the servings here are huge...we always order \"baby omelets\" which are 3 instead of 6 eggs, and we still always have leftovers.  Prices are very fair especially considering the quality and serving sizes.  The potatoes are great and everything is fresh!   And the banana and pumpkin bread are crazy good!  In the mornings, they come out piping hot!  If you want a solid breakfast, look no further!",

Today it's dated, the food is bland, and the menu is whatevs. Or maybe people from podunk parts of America aren't accustomed to good breakfast places and equate big with delicious. Everything we ordered was bland, the potatoes are basically potato chips, and everything is sticky. Portions are big, but you're getting more of the same blah food, so who cares?

The O.H is situated towards the back of a little strip mall. The decor is 1970's grandma style....very quaint and nauseating with the random selection of things. However, I swear there is a room where you can get married located all the way in the back of fhe restaurant. \"I do!\" Now bring on the banana bread wedding cake lol (for those that know what I'm talking about).   Food: A+ with gold stars. I've tried their omelettes even though they have other things but why go to the OMLETTE HOUSE and order a salad? I've never been disappointed with the food. I go for the petite selection which is 3 eggs versus the OG size of 1/2 dz eggs. ALWAYS order the banana bread as your bread choice. Moist, rich in flavor, warm....mmmm   The zucchini spears are good too. Service was on point but it was Monday mid-morning.  I've been during weekend and there is a little wait but never to the point where you say, \"forget this.\"  They close at 3pm (I believe) but check with them to make sure.

    "text": "The Omelet House is old-school Vegas. As expected,  omelets feature prominently with approximately 40 varieties to choose. Other breakfast classics are done well.  You can go every weekend and never get bored.  The corned beef hash is one favorite off-omelet offerings but honestly,  the omelets are where my taste buds lead me nearly every time. Signature sides of thinly sliced potatoes,  crispy and seasoned and homemade pumpkin or banana nut bread round out my plate.  The many of the servers have worked at this friendly, locally owned family business and it contributes nicely to a warm atmosphere.  I love bringing out of town guests here for breakfast or brunch.  Expect a bit of a wait to be seated as demand for a great breakfast in this popular, homey establishment.",

I would even recommend getting the jr omelette for .90 cents less for those who don't eat to much.. They make the banana and pumpkin bread fresh themselves, which looked delightful.

It's very kitschy, but it has that old mom-and-pop diner atmosphere, and that type of menu as well.  We tried their stuffed French toast and their pancakes combos. The food was good, tasty enough, but not particularly outstanding or inspired.  Basically, this is your typical all-American breakfast joint.

    "text": "The Omelet House is pure calorie overload, and as you might suspect there is nothing gourmet about it.  However, knowing what you're going in for, it's good classic comfort (read: deep fried) food.    We started with the fried zucchini at the suggestion of the waitress, which came with ranch and orange \"cheese\" sauce, and was good in that it just tasted like fried dough (I'm not sure why they even bother to put zucchini inside!).  I had the scrambled eggs with wheat toast and potatoes - for those of you who don't like your toast pre-soaked with butter you must ask for it dry, and beware the potatoes are sliced like potato chips but are not crunchy... not really my thing, but my boyfriend loved them.  He got an omelet made-to-order with spinach and cheese and mushrooms and it was enormous, but he made a good dent in it.  :)    We also got the pumpkin bread and banana bread on the side and both were moist and tasty.  My better half said the coffee was surprisingly good, and we both found the service to be very friendly and quick.  Oh, and as far as location - if you're not a local, be prepared to pay about $20 for a cab from the strip to get here, which is pretty steep considering the bill for two people was around $30.",

It's close to our house, and I love all things breakfast food, so it won. Turns out, if it's your birthday, you get your meal free! (not drinks, and not \"extras\", but the first time they let me add on to my omelet for free anyway - can't hurt to ask). Now it's our birthday tradition :)  I tend to get either the lobster omelet or the lobster eggs benedict - I just love those feisty crustaceans. The portions are definitely huge, but they make great leftovers, so what's the big deal? Both lobster meals are very heavy on the lobster - giant chunks. If I'm feeling saucy, I add bacon and shrimp to go with the included avocados :)   The potatoes are kinda homemade chip style - not always awesome warmed up later, but nicely seasoned. And the pumpkin bread is worth getting an extra side.",

OMELETS ANY WAY YOU CAN THINK OF!! :) I ordered a single pancake with blueberries and he ordered an omelet (the Juan one, add bacon) I tried his and it was AMAZING! I especially liked the \"house potatoes\", I could've eaten a plateful alone! :) My pancake was okay, personally the topping was a bit more like syrupy pie filling and a little on the sweet side but it was more than enough and I enjoyed it!  The service was just as great! The employees were friendly and even though very busy they all seemed to be in sync & working together! Our cups were refilled and plates cleared promptly!

I dunno, it's just a good, \"loved\" vibe about and it was bumping with a mix of people from club kids to old timers who probably have been coming every Sunday since '79.    I got the lobster egg benedict and the BF got a Joes Special- which the menu lists with \"ground beef, spinach, garlic, onion & jack cheese and secret seasonings\" .  It was decent benedict, very homey, diner benny with a solid hollandaise.  I like that their potatoes are a cross between potato chips and griddle scalloped potatoes.   BF couldnt finish his omelet. It was a hefty portion though I see now you can order a \"baby\" size which still is quite a portion. His omelet was pretty tasty from the bites I tried. It has fluffy egg which is my big schtick with many places who make it so well done it just gets too dense.  Best part is they have something for everyone with their extensive menu. It took us quite a while to decide and probably will each time. Now that we at least tried the breakfasts, I will try to order a lunch entree next time.  This place was so hyped up by people that I was afraid to go, but I think it's a solid comfort food breakfast spot with friendly, family establishment hospitality.",

I ordered the Kitchen Sink one time and actually ate the entire thing- I was impressed with myself, but I was also well impressed by the omelet. It was delicious and each bite was full of meat and vegetables. Most people do not finish this dish.    They do not have hash browns but they have spuds, which are just as good but ask for them well-done as they served me soggy, greasy ones last time, even though I asked for them to be well-done.   The burgers here are really good, too. Medium-rare burger actually comes out pink in the middle. It's huge, juicy and thick. Our first time here, we ordered burgers because the woman next to our table was eating one and we were jealous.   Everyone's food that passes by makes me jealous but I always love what I end up with! Except for those greasy, soggy and cold spuds, I've never had a bad experience here. They were too busy today so we opted for Jimmy John's, instead.",

The place is decorated with a lot of history (Vegas and otherwise), we sat in a Mayor's booth.  The potatoes were chip style, I would have loved the option of country style.  Oh my!!!  The banana bread was incredible - our server was super friendly and knew that we couldn't possibly finish our fresh baked banana bread, so she offered to wrap it to go.  It was the perfect snack for our 5 hour drive home.  Thank you Omelet House - Best Breakfast in Las Vegas - We will continue to always visit when in Vegas!",

I found this place on Yelp and boy am I happy I did! We drove maybe 10 minutes from our hotel and got seated within less than 5 minutes. Everyone is very nice and our waitress Valerie was a sweetheart! She recommended the pumpkin muffin that came with my husband's omelette meal, and she even cut it in half so we could share. Valerie also let me know my waffle had come out a little burnt so she had them make me a new one and brought out my eggs and sausage while I waited.   I got the waffle special and it was so delicious! Very big portions so we also have yummy leftovers for our drive back home. We also got a side of biscuits and gravy and it wasn't the BEST I had, a little salty, but the biscuit was really good. You could tell everything was freshly made. I would highly recommend this place!",

Seriously, she first came to take orders at about :45 seconds. When we said we needed another minute, sh must have taken us too literally, because she came back about :60 second later. Cripes, girl, it's my first time here and you've got four pages to look through.  *EGGS BENEDICT ALERT*  Really, really good eggs bene!

When you walk inside it kinda looks a little mismatched and it's almost like a maze to get to some of the tables. When I looked at the menu the first thing I noticed was the 40 different omellette's. After seeing other people getting their food and seeing huge the portions were I decided to go with the 38 special (perfect for meat lovers). The food was amazing. Every bite was packed with meat. There wasn't an overkill of cheese. I did have the large portion (6 eggs) but I could have easily done with the small portion (3 eggs). My only complaint was that they serve home fries instead of hash browns. Hash browns are not even an option. Also, you might want to try the pumpkin spice bread, it was pretty tasty.",

The bread is super fresh and warm and served with whipped butter, it doesn't get much better than that. I have actually been here a couple of times and the service is always consistent, very sweet, very attentive staff. The food is sooooo good, I ordered the Petunia omelet and it was great, I loved the crispy bacon in it. Another great consistent food is the potatoes, they are like homeade chips but they go wth everything. I love that they have something different than every other breakfast joint.",

Its not as over the top as The Peppermill, but it on par with the food. Not sure if I would make an effort to come back out here again, but you won't go wrong trying this place out for yourself.",

    "text": "Two words:  Banana Bread!!!  Menu has a long list of selections of different types of omelettes.  They also have the sweet breakfast stuff like pancakes and french toasts, etc.  On other other side is the lunch menu, which I didn't even get a chance to look at, are burgers, salads, sandwiches, and other lunch items.  Got the Egg White special for $10.19 and got it \"baby\" omelette, which is an 89 cent discount for a smaller omelette.  Definitely get the \"baby\" portion if you can't finish a lot of food since the regular size omelettes are huge!!  Most of my friends couldn't finish their regular omelettes or split a regular one.  Egg white omelete was good - filled with zucchini, spinach, and some other stuff I forgot.  I added an avocado for an extra $1.49.  You couldn't really see the egg whites, though, because it was filled with a lot of veggies!!  It was pretty good, maybe needed a hint of salt.  Also comes with a side of potatoes sliced like potato chips and cooked almost like potato chips with a few soggy potatoes.  Sooo delicious!  I loved their potatoes.  I try not to eat too many potatoes (too many carbs) but I couldn't stop eating these.  Yum yum.  Comes with choice of banana bread, toast, or pumpkin bread.  Get the banana bread!!  It was soo good and delicious.  Came out hot and fresh with walnuts on top.  It was so moist and delicious with the butter.  So good!  There wasn't too much of a banana flavor but it was still really good!  Our waitress was awesome!!  So friendly and easy-going and talkative.  Makes you feel right at home.  They filled out waters all the time and checked up on us.  Got a taste of the hubby's coffee and it was good, too!!  All of my friends loved this place and their omelettes!  Would definitely come back if we're in Vegas again.",

It is located in a strip mall area of Vegas, but there is always a line, and that is a very good sign.   The first time we ate here we stumbled on to the place and decided it had to be good if the line was so long.  We talked with several people in line and about 90% of them were locals....also a very good sign.  Excellent breakfast and a nice break from the action of the strip.",

If you are craving hashbrowns or country style potatoes they do not serve them here, I found out. They do offer a freshly made potatoe chip. The service was also good and they always keep your cup full of coffee. If in the area stop by and you will find yourself around many of the locals.",

Now as for the service I was very impressed. If you have coffee there is a server coming around every 5 minutes. Your cup will never be empty. All of the waitresses had a smile on their faces and conversing with you making sure you had what you needed. The wait time was next to nothing.

But I understand - a \"quick brunch\" is a bit of an oxymoron. I ordered the patty melt with a side salad instead of spuds. The sandwich had some decent flavor, but it was super greasy. The side salad was small, considering the helping of spuds is usually quite generous, and there was exactly 1 round carrot slice, 1 cucumber slice, 1 radish slice, and 1 small celery stick offered in addition to the actual lettuce. I found it strange to offer such a chintzy amount of vegetables when it wouldn't hurt to include a handful instead. My friend ordered the chicken fried steak and enjoyed it, although the eggs it came with were dry.",

They're made with 6 eggs for the \"large\" and 3 eggs for the \"baby.\" Personally, I think it's more bang for your buck to get the large as the price difference is only about a dollar.   I've tried a variety of omelets and each time it was delicious. My faves are the Rio Grande Surfer and the Cowboy Special. The distribution of ingredients throughout the omelets is a little off sometimes so don't think they skimped out on you when you make that first cut!  Before Omelet House I was never a huge fan of omelets. Now, I get excited whenever I see the sign. A tip: definitely get either the banana nut bread or pumpkin nut bread instead of the toast. It's no extra cost and is half the reason I love this place.  The service here is also impeccable. The waitresses are always friendly and quick to refill drinks/take your order. They even take the time to assure you your food is quick on the way if you've been waiting a few minutes.",

Not to mention it's by the historic neighborhood of old Las Vegas, right near Alta where all the celebrities used to live back in the day!  If these walls could talk!  Just imagine the stories!  Located in an older strip mall just off of Charleston, Omelet House is ready to mix up a serving of nostalgia for you.  I mean, the place just oozes the past!  Kitschy items all throughout, down to the smell of days past!  Thankfully, the food is great!  I work near here and never really been in the restaurant until my wife took me one day.  She and her co-workers often frequent here for staff meetings or get-togethers.  The food here?  Some excellent, stick-to-your-ribs, no frills, no apologies...hearty EATS!  If you leave Omelet House hungry that is your own fault.  I'm a big dude and I didn't finish all my breakfast!  Cold leftovers for later, lovin' it.  Wifey and I ordered:  *Chicken Fried Steak & Eggs *\"The Sparticus\" omelet - dubbed the Kirk Douglas special, has asparagus, mushrooms, cheddar cheese & special cheese sauce on the side  Each breakfast plate is served with Spuds (kinda like potato chips but thicker), and your choice of toast, English muffin, tortillas, Homemade Pumpkin Nut Bread or Banana Nut Bread.  We chose one of each - Pumpkin Nut Bread and Banana Nut Bread.  Food didn't take too long to come from the kitchen, maybe about 20 minutes.  Big portions!  Food was warm, and more importantly - TASTY.  Those dang spuds were delightfully addictive.  Yummy with a splash of hot sauce and a dip of ketchup!  Wifey's Chicken Fried Steak was cooked well and smothered with some delicious gravy!  So so so rich.  The Sparticus omelet was great too, full of fresh asparagus and mushrooms & lots of cheddar cheese.  The side of special cheese sauce was totally unnecessary so I didn't much bother with it except to dip my spuds!    The Pumpkin Nut Bread and the Banana Nut Bread were good but on the dry side, my only other complaint was that they tasted somewhat similar.  I love banana bread so I was hoping for more of a banana taste.  The coffee is good & strong and just kept coming.  The service was excellent as well.  No complaints overall, unless you want me to count calories.  Great breakfast spot!",

Sometimes with a group, sometimes by myself. The first time I obviously had to get an omelette. They're enormous and extremely delicious. You can easily choose to split it with another and it's still more than enough food. The breakfast spuds are great and you have your choice of breads including banana nut and pumpkin with certain meals. I've yet to come for lunch but will sometime and update my review.  Recently, I've just been addicted to the country scrambler breakfast special. Comes with eggs,  ham, onion, mushroom, cheese, breakfast spuds and choice of bread for $6.99. I've had a few different servers, Jose has been great but they all are on top of their shit. When I go by myself I'm literally sat, finished eating, paid tab, and out the door within 15-25 minutes. Easily 5 stars.",

The \"fusion\" restaurants sometimes overdo things that should remain simple.  So, we decided to leave the Strip behind and find a True local spot.  Omelet House quickly entered our radar.  After reading the reviews, we knew that the portions here were large.  So, we decided to share an omelet and a waffle.  What a pleasant surprise!!  The OH is a diamond in a mountain full of carbon.  It truly delivers on taste and service.  Their signature \"chips\" put normal hash browns to shame.  I must say that I was so happy that we chose the OH as our breakfast spot.  It will be a regular hangout when we're in the Vegas area.  I highly recommend giving the OH a try.  You will not be disappointed.  In fact, you will be elated that you visited them.  As a side note, as we were leaving, we started to see the line forming.  I recommend getting here early!!",

I had bacon, eggs over easy and sourdough toast with a slice of French toast just to try because our waitress said it was her absolute favorite thing on the menu. Great bacon...not thin and not thick-just right and delicious.  My wife had one the their famous Omelets with Swiss cheese and avocado - the avo was both inside and out and was perfectly ripe.  Our local friend (it was her first time here) had a waffle with scramble eggs and bacon.  Our meals came with those homemade potato chippy things with garlic salt everyone on yelp talked about. All I'll say here is we all enjoyed them. My wife ordered hers without salt and were a tad underdone- but the owner overheard her telling us and insisted on fixing it by bringing another plate filled with those delicious potatoes.  The coffee was ok. I prefer supper dark full bodied coffee, but I was there for good eats and the coffee was totally drinkable.  We all took home leftovers. Next time I'd like to share a meal! So in the end we paid $55 including a generous tip, ate three meals and have three \"leftovers\" meals for later.  WE WILL BE BACK",

    "text": "Wack is the word that comes to mind from my experience here.   Walking in this place is country cute and felt like an old grandmas home, I enjoyed the very cozy atmosphere.   As we sat down we ordered two orange juices and as they were brought over by a young kid they both slipped out of his hands (maybe because he was attempting to carry 2 waters & 2 juices at the same time). All 4 drinks landed on my lap...down my legs and into my ballerina flats. What a way to start a Sunday morning off! FML!  After basically washing my ass & legs in the bathroom and my ballerina flats now squishy from taking a full bath I was pretty bummed. I decided to stay because this place was bookmarked forever & I was really hungry for some great breakfast food. I need to also point out everyone apologized & the manager came over & said my breakfast was on him. That helped but now I'm sitting here soaking wet.   We ordered banana nut & pumpkin bread which were both great. I ordered a Black Forest ham omelet & it was massive. Unfortunately I took a few bites & was over it. The entire thing was in a puddle of grease & butter and there must have been a pound of Swiss cheese on this thing. Just a bunch of thick wads of cheese everywhere. So gross and it felt like a heart attack on a plate, no thanks. My man did enjoy his polish sausage & eggs and luckily my plate was free because it would have really sucked to pay for that.  Here's the worst part. After getting 4 cups spilled directly onto my lap they didn't charge me for my food however they charged my man for his and guess what, they also charged us for the drinks. What a joke. I could definitely get over the accident but to be known for the omelette's here and to have one of the shittiest omelette's I've ever had was too much.   Next time when you spill anything on your customers, just a piece of advice DON'T CHARGE THEM for what was spilled on them. Common sense...",

    "text": "The Lobster Benedict was what I ordered. With no regrets. The side option was thinly sliced chip-like potatoes. I dipped these in the hollandaise that smothered my benedict dish.   A nice selection of hot sauces:  Tabasco, Frank's, Cholula.  Coffee wasn't great.   The service is pretty on point. I have to say that I had forgotten who our server was because she was tag-teaming with at least 4 others.   So when boyfriend didn't get his side of pumpkin bread, I asked the next server that refilled our coffee about it. She scanned our table and told us she would be back with it right away.   I guess our original server saw her do this and ran over to our table. She asked the other server what she was bringing us. She told her that we hadn't gotten our bread. Original server asks me if she had brought the pumpkin bread out and I say \"no\". She then grabs our receipt from the table and says, pointing at me, \"She doesn't get bread with her dish\" to the other server. Other server says, \"Well, we forgot, so they get two now.\" Original server makes a huge deal and finally says \"ugh, okay. They can have both. This time.\"  So rude? So not what I was expecting? I'm more than aware that the English muffin from my benedict counts as my toast option, but when the server brought bread for both of us, I figured it was her way of making up for forgetting about us. Our original server made it seem like we were scamming them out of pumpkin bread. Did she get up early to bake it herself?  Boyfriend asked her for a to-go box for his unfinished bread. I made it a point to tell her that we only need it for the one piece, but she acted like she didn't hear me.   I'd definitely go back to Omelet House. I would say that I'd just avoid being sat in her section, but I honesty don't remember what she looked like!",

We LOVE the homemade fried zucchini, long strips dipped in a light batter that will have you craving them always (we have them as a breakfast appetizer with ranch instead of cheese)...      I have tried a lot of different dishes, (I often order the awesome Lobster Eggs Benedict) and every thing has consistently been great... I look forward to the choice of bread and their homemade potato chips on the side as well... yummy!      The kitschy feel of the place, and comfortable decor reminds me of a cottage with old Vegas entertainers signed pictures on the wall by the door.  The menu even has a sense of humor; see the \"Flatlander's Special\" Omelet.       I always take out of town guest here and they always want to go on their next visit as well.

Once I left I realized I didn't get part of my order. My fault I should've checked. The food was negligently packed, food spilled everywhere though I held it up right.

I enjoy that they clean their condiments tops everynight. Making it feel like home. The only thing is they do it while your eating, reaching over you. Also, when its not busy they talk more to eachother then take your order. Other than that, food is great!",

    "text": "After getting burned on multiple Strip recommendations (that's the road, not strip clubs), I sought a highly rated breakfast place that was a little more local, away from the hungover sin fest and douchery along Las Vegas Boulevard. I'm sad to report that my new favorite omelette (or omelet?) is two time zones away from where I reside. This is why we need to eliminate time zones altogether and have one universal clock. Then that way I could have Omelet House anytime I wanted. Er, wait...  ...Anyway, think Denny's, but way nicer and friendlier and less greasy. Actually, don't think Denny's. It's a quaint, old-timey establishment that is unapologetic for what it is. I'm surprised to find these kinds of friendly, no-frills restaurants with (mostly) good folks in them. That's what I get for forgetting that Las Vegas is still a city outside the Strip, with hospitals, offices, grocery stores, and friendly restaurants. My older server was delightful. And when people say the omelettes (or omelets?) are enormous, they are not lying whatsoever. They're gargantuan and hearty. And with many options to choose from, you're sure to find one to your liking. The spuds on the side, though, are basically potato chips but harder to eat. You get a choice of banana bread or pumpkin bread or toast before the meal, which is fun.  But what bothered me most here was, as a guy was bussing a table, the manager came out behind him wiping tables (typical manager, doing the easy part), and called him out in front of everybody, saying he needed to pick up the pace because his fellow associates had made complaints about him not working quicker. I hope that manager reads this: that's not okay. Do that kind of thing in private. I guarantee you that kind of management toward me would have the opposite effect than me working faster.  One-star reduction for the spuds (although they are unique, which is nice) and that manager.  Omelettes (or omelets?): 5/5 Service: 4/5",

Immediately after being seated we were greeted by three people making sure we had our drink order in. The food was amazing! I had Blueberry stuffed french toast with eggs and the most perfect bacon I've ever had. The ONLY downside (and this is simply a preference and not an actual con) is the spuds. I love me some hashbrowns or country potatoes but they serve more like a roasted potato almost like a chip but softer? It was good, just not what I preferred. My husband ordered an omelet and it was just as delicious! Wonderful experience! Definitely going back next time we're in Vegas!",

I'm not much of an egg person, and I find that most restaurants just don't do them to my liking. But these were heaven.   The hash was real, house-made corned beef hash, and it was damn good too, but the Eggs Benedict... whew! Easily the best eggs Benedict I've had.   Our second visit was on a Sunday, not particularly early in the morning, maybe about 10:30ish, and the service wasn't quite as friendly as the first visit, but to be fair, the service was still snappy, the personality of the server was a bit annoying. Nothing I'd knock the restaurant for.   Go there, get the Eggs Benedict.",

If you don't want an omelette don't worry they have all the breakfast foods available and they also have lunch food such as burgers.  Their burgers are to die for as well.  I wasn't expecting the burger here to be so good but it was amazing so it is safe to say that anything you order here is going to taste amazing and you are going to have a wonderful experience.

The server that showed us to the Garden Room, mentioned how crowded they were, probably due to it being the day after Father's Day. The Garden Room was a bit more intimate, fake hanging plants and all.  Our server gave us a few minutes to look over our menus, then we decided on the following: my wife the Health Nut Omelet, since in her words \"you can't come to Omelet House without ordering an Omelet. That would be like going to IHOP without ordering pancakes\". Her extra tomatoes were noticeably missing and when brought to the server's attention he removed the additional .79 charge. She also chose the banana nut bread which came out first. She shared it with me but I only wanted a small sample, which was very good and moist.   Our plates arrived not too long after. Oh, I ordered the Huevos Rancheros with scrambled eggs. Good sauce and large portions, but I've definitely had better. I also ordered a side of 2 Turkey Sausage Patties(average). Not to say that I didn't clean my plate, my wife even joked that all I needed to do now was lick it. I was hungry. She had plenty to bring back home. One plus was the size of my regular order of orange juice. No need to go large when regular is enough to wash it all down.",

    "text": "You would be crazy to come to The Omelet House and not order an omelet! Lol   Located on Charleston and Rancho this establishment has been around since 1979 that's almost 40 years! And for a restaurant to be still in business for that long really is an accomplishment on its own. So good for you Mr.Mills you've created something amazing for this community so congratulations.   Let me tell you about my experience here at The omelet house . I took my mother and my daughter here we wanted to eat somewhere different so I went on yelp and this place popped up. So we pulled up parked ,we saw a lot of cars in the parking lot so I was already thinking there was gonna be a long wait to be seated. Boy I was wrong as soon as we walked in we were almost immediately seated lol. I guess this place is able to seat 250 guests now that's a lot of room .  The atmosphere had a very old fashioned antique feel almost as if they had my grandma in the kitchen about to cook us breakfast.   The service was excellent very friendly waitress and servers you can tell they were True professionals and they loved their jobs. Very knowledgeable about the menu and super energetic and outgoing which I love. So good job guys keep it up way to represent!   The food was excellent I hardly ever finish all of my food but here I ate everything even my toast lol the only thing I regret is not getting some banana bread instead of the toast . They don't do hash brows here you get a side of homemade chips instead which were out of this world . The portion sizes were gigantic you mostly likely have leftovers and yes they have to go boxes and I bet they have slot of them haha. So I have two words for you .. LOBSTER  OMELET . Yes real chucks of lobster and avocado!  This place has won me over and I will definitely return in the near future. I recommend this place for breakfast for sure best breakfast spot in Vegas for a reason ! GO GO GO!!!",

You must have the banana bread! Did I say MUST? I mean ohhh emm geee, iits sooo delicious with some melted butter spread on top. You'll thank me ! Crab Benedict to die for! I rarely order Benedicts but this menu item continued to catch my eye. When I say, it did not disappoint, It Did Not Disappoint! My boyfriend was sooooo mad and jealous he did not order it. He literally went back a few days later just to order one! This place is MUST ! Very reasonable in cost and portions size are perfect",

    "text": "What a wide selection of omelettes The Omelette House offers. Wasn't crazy about the decor and layout of tables at The Omelette House but the food was decent. The decor honestly weirded me out. Also you have to walk through a kitchen/prep area to get to half the tables on the other side of the restaurant. Did not like that. This seems very unsanitary. What about people coughing and or sneezing or just breathing heavy as they walk through this area where waiters are getting your drinks, storing dishes etc?! The omelettes are HUUGE!! I could only eat about half my omelette. A plus is they offer turkey bacon. So I added avocado and turkey bacon inside my omelette. It was a very nice touch. However do not order the turkey bacon by itself. Not good! My husband ordered a side of turkey bacon, took one bite and didn't eat the rest. Much better broken up in smaller pieces inside the omelette.  Not sure I'd eat here again next time I'm in Vegas but it was a nice experience for the time I did go.",

    "text": "This hugely popular breakfast/brunch place is located less than 2 miles from the strip, hidden in a dilapidated strip mall off Charleston Blvd. The locals seem to know where it is, as there were tons of people in business attire enjoying their lunch break.  We came here on a Monday around 11:30 AM and the place was busy. When we walked in,  there was a dining room to the left and more seating area straight ahead.  We were seated at neither location but we were led to the right and to a huge, hidden dining area. This place was pretty big!!  Like the restaurant, The menu was just as big, as we were given tabloid size laminated menu with one side with omelettes and breakfast items, and on the other side lunch items.I had to take a video of the menu because I wasn't sure my phone could capture the whole thing.  It's took us about 10 minutes to figure out what we want it, and ironically, not one of us ordered the omelet.    We were at the Henderson location 2 years ago and Stephen ordered the house corned beef hash and eggs.   He liked it so much, he decided to order it again here.  Karen had the country scrambler, and I had the ham and eggs.   Stephen's corned beef hash took up almost half the plate along with his to sunny-side eggs. There were chunks of beef, and you could see it definitely was made from scratch.    Karen also had a very generous helping of eggs with chunks of ham and loads of melted cheese. My ham steak was about a half inch thick and took up the entire plate as well.  They had to serve my egg and spuds on a separate plate.   All of the breakfast orders came with their version of spuds, which was a cross between slices of potatoes grilled almost to chip consistency. The breakfast also came with bread, which included their pumpkin or banana nut bread.   Service was a little spotty, as it took a while to get things we asked for. We asked for Splenda, and it took a while, and I never got my refill of my Diet Coke. However, coffee cups were refilled regularly and frequently.  Friendly people, huge portions, are reasons why I can see why this place is very popular on weekends.",

The order (according to the menu) came with Spuds and \"your choice of toast, English muffin, homemade pumpkin nut bread, banana bread, or tortillas\". I went with the Spuds and banana bread. The Spuds are basically potato chips with seasoning. They tasted soft and old. The banana bread was pretty good. It came out nice and warm. I wasn't blown away by the Benedict. Instead of Canadian ham, they layered it with a stack of deli ham. And there was just too much sauce.   PRICES: ~$10/dish. According to the menu, I thought the banana bread was included but apparently it wasn't. I had to pay an extra $2.50. Coffee was $2.50 as well, includes refills.   SERVICE: My waitress checked on me a few times and refilled my cup whenever needed. She was nice and friendly.   Overall, I wouldn't come back here. I paid $20 total for one person. I don't mind paying that price but I've been to better bfast spots that also offer better combos and deals.",

I stopped in on this day to have lunch with a friend. I usually order an omelette or breakfast item but this time I tried the Just A Hamburger with their signature chips. I also shared a piece of their delicious banana bread which is one of their featured items. They also serve pumpkin bread which is just as yummy. My burger was huge! I ordered it San Francisco style with Swiss cheese, thousand island dressing and pickles. It was really tasty and definitely one of the better burgers I have had in a while. I also really enjoy their breakfast items. There is much to choose from including pancakes, French toast, omelette and various egg dishes served with or without meat. The portions are large so sometimes I share a meal with a friend.   The service is always friendly and employees that work here have been dedicated to this family owned restaurant for quite some time. There is nothing fancy to the decor, just kitschy and unique. I always feel at home dining here like I just got back from a long trip. This place is definitely a throwback to old Las Vegas and I hope it never changes!",

I had the country scramble, it came with ham, mushrooms, eggs, onions and potato's, without the cheese. It was good, the potato was served like chips which I used to scoop up my food and eat. I got a side of salsa and I have to say, get the salsa it's yummy.  Service was good and my water never ran out.   I'm here for a week so I am sure I will be back.",

I dislike how noisy and crowed it can be, but I suppose that's expected. Our server was quick, gave us the attention we needed during our meal, no rush, got the order right, no issues.   The food was good - fatty - guaranteed to help you pack on at least 5 pounds. But the omelette were HUGE and of course there's other typical breakfast stuff, pancakes, waffles, bread muffins. The coffee was not very good but at least it was warm.   I could probably come back for something lighter. I was really impressed at how easy it was to come in, get seated, order, eat, and get our check and no issues.",

Everyone is extremely friendly, the food is delicious and let me tell you about the banana nut bread.  It's freaking ridiculous something so good is considered a \"side\" instead of toast.  The omelets are massive and you can choose your chips, hash-browns or potatoes... I've had them all, they are all great.

I've come here on countless occasions when at UMC hospital. Just good food, service, and feel every time.   They have a plethora of customs omelettes with countless combinations if you want to make your own. What I love is a normal size omelette is 6 eggs!! No one else does that! That's amazing.   I haven't had a chance to have the pancakes or French toast. But just by looking at the menu and how they make them (fruit cooked inside the pancake) - that's how you're supposed to do it.  When here, you have to try the freshly made banana nut bread with butter. Soooo...good!  If you are a spuds fan, then you will love this place because that's all they serve. I'm a little disappointed that you can't swap the spuds for fruit, oatmeal, potatoes, hash browns, or even greens. That would be a great improvement if they could one or all of these.   Definitely a staple of Vegas and a must try if you want to be happily stuffed for just good clean breakfast.",

There's antique knik-knacks everywhere and it's all strangely decorated that just tells you something about happiness... or some cheezy nonsense like that.   After the Lumberjacks fiasco, we're seated instantly, towards the back through this maze of an area filled, no joke.. FILLED with people. All smiles from the workers and the customers. Our drinks are immediately ordered and the bathroom is easily found by the signs that tell you where you need to go.  Our order was taken by a lovely waitress and drinks are refilled by a guy walking around with pitchers of water and pot of coffee.   Our food arrives and mine looks delicious. Blueberry stuffed pancakes and a side of spuds for me and what was supposed to be a Pastrami Burger for boyfriend... but the waitress mis-heard him and got him a Country Scrambler. Quickly corrected, she races back to tells us that his order is being made on rush and should be out in a few minutes. Once it's out, his burger is piping hot. She tells us that she'll be charging us for the Country Scrambler instead of the burger since it was her mis-hap. It's a few dollars cheaper, so we are a happy couple.   Food was absolutely delicious and I'm definitely revisiting.",

First of all, a big thank you to our waitress Megan.  She was awesome!  Fast friendly service and a great sense of humor.  Look no further if you want a great breakfast experience.  Breakfast entrees can easily serve 2-3 people.  There is a surcharge of 95 cents if you split an entree.  Our group ordered the following entrees.    Kitchen Sink Corn Beef Hash Chile Verde Omelette Stuffed French Toast with Apple compote Meat Lovers Omelette  All were yummy....but my favorites were the  Kitchen Sink and Corn Beef Hash.  True to it's name, the kitchen sink had a little of everything, bacon, sausage, ham, mushrooms, 2 maybe 3 kinds of cheese, beans, bell peppers and more.  Sampling all the entrees put me into a food coma so my memory fails me.  The corn beef hash is homemade.  Yum!!Served with fried potatoes and your choice of banana or pumpkin bread.  Think extra thick potato chips.  Crunchy on the outside, some with soft centers.  My favorite was the banana bread.  Definitely will be back the next time I am in Vegas!  Not soon enough for hubby......  P.S.  Check out the \"Flatlanders\" special.  Reserved for the adventurous.",

She also gave full descriptions of the items we were in question about and told us her favorites.    My favorite thing to order here is their corned beef hash - extra crispy.  They make the corned beef from scratch, shred it, add the potatoes, and fry to a crispy brown.  Served with home fries (think, meaty potato chips) and eggs, this can hold you all day long.  One of my go to places when staying in Vegas.",

    "text": "Came here with a friend for breakfast at about 9 a.m. on a Saturday morning.  Was very busy, but we were seated fairly quickly.  Service is very efficient - the servers have busers and runners to keep coffee cups full (very good coffee!).  Our server was very friendly and helpful as well.  I got the cowboy special - a chili cheese omelet, which came with potatoes and (I chose) a side of pumpkin bread.  The pumpkin bread came out quickly, and was, warm, moist and delicious, especially with the coffee.  Omelet arrived before I finished my pumpkin bread - kitchen definitely runs like clockwork here.  The omelet was HUGE and good, but a little heavy on the (raw) onions for my taste.  Nice chili.  The eggs were a little firmer then I like, but that's just me (my perfect omelet is Peppermill).  Was still tasty though.  The potatoes on the side were really good - like a combination of a potato chip and a french fry.  I ended up taking them home and having them that night for dinner - they were great even cold and refrigerated.  We finished up, got the bill (arrived very promptly at the end of the meal), and vacated the table for the next party - we realized when we left (about 9:45) that the line was not only out the door, but was starting to wrap around the building.  Definitely would like to come back and try some of their other items.  Food is good, very nice service, just get there early if you're going for breakfast!",

Two must orders are the fried zucchini and the pumpkin bread.  I took a friend this morning (she was hooked a few years ago so we always go at least once when she is here.) The food was great.  Breakfast scramble, waffle special and, of course, a 1/2 order of zucchini.  Gavin was our waiter.  I will say that while I have always received good service, today was stellar. Gavin was second to none as a waiter.  Food came out hot. Drinks were kept full.  He did not hover, but made sure that all was good at our table.  Thank you, Gavin!!!!",

I would say it's 2nd only to Bryant's Breakfast in Memphis, so definitely #1 West of the Rockies.  As I've mentioned before, go here the morning you're leaving: no chance you'll feel hungry on the plane flight home, however long it is.  I've been migrating from the popeye lately to the king of hearts omelet (which is with artichokes and jack cheese.)  I've also found you can get a \"small\" omelet if you ask for it, which comes on a small plate, but I think has the same amount of fillings, just fewer eggs (it only costs a few cents less, but a full-size omelet probably has a week's worth of eggs unless you get egg whites.)  The potatoes were better this time around...so I added the star back, although service was spotty (but friendly.)  My friend who was visiting Vegas this week liked it so much he insisted on coming here 3 mornings in the 4 days he was in town.  And don't forget the pumpkin or banana bread instead of toast...that's essential here.",

What I like in a breakfast spot, lot's of choices, a little grease, and great tasting grub. This place has all of the above.   I had 2 eggs with corned beef hash, the hash is homemade!, yep and oh so good. My husband had the lobster bennie, and they did not skimp on the lobster, another delight.

    "text": "From the outside, you might think it's not all that appealing. It's been there since 1978 and they haven't done that much to \"update\" (which I rather love). But, Omelet House is the exact right combination of kitsch and comfort.   The interior is like a time machine. It's got a very 70's breakfast diner vibe, kind of like a Cracker Barrel, though not as countrified and not manufactured. It feels authentic and their knick-knacks feel curated and not just cookie cutter. It's got a lot of character and charm. It feels like going to breakfast with your grandparents.  In that good way.  The staff was so warm and genuinely enthusiastic about the food. When I asked two different servers what their favorites were, they were more than happy to share. They also pointed out that their omelets are SIX eggs and the options we had when ordering: we could get it baby-sized (3 eggs) for .89 cents less. Or we could split the full-size for .95 cents more and they'll give you extra potatoes. So that's pretty cool.  The prices were on par with other breakfast spots like Cracked Egg and Babystacks. Maybe a tiny bit higher, but there are six eggs in those omelets. SIX. So you're getting a lot for your money.  Each omelet was in the $9-10 range and they are served with toast (or homemade pumpkin or banana bread) and thin-sliced breakfast potatoes (almost crispy!).    There are maybe 15or 20 kinds of omelets to choose from. I had a baby-sized \"green chile omelet\", which had pork, chile verde and jack cheese. Even baby-sized, I could only eat half and barely made a dent in the potatoes, which were delicious. Everything was delicious, actually.  The look/texture of the chile verde was a little different than I expected. It's not *pretty*, per say, but it was *tasty*. Food around the room all looked delicious, I think it's just the nature of that particular style of sauce.  I'd eat it if offered, but don't know that I'd *order* it with so many other options.  Had a bite or two of the blueberry waffle, which was amazing, as well. Light, fluffy with the blueberry compote not overly sweet. Definitely a win when so many Belgian waffles tend to be too heavy or tough.  Two breakfasts with one orange juice was $24.65.  A little more than say, Denny's or IHOP, but much, much better.  And we brought home the leftovers to make into breakfast tacos for dinner.    Looking forward to going again... maybe next weekend...",

Plus, it's only a few minutes away from the strip. With everything on the strip being so expensive, especially the food and buffets, finding this place was definitely a nice alternative. Like I said, all the food is great, so the only suggestion I have is to \"baby-size\" your food because the portions are huge. They use around 6 eggs to make a normal meal. That's a pretty unhealthy dose of cholesterol in my opinion.",

It's a locals favorite gem, a dive some might say, that dishes out some mean portions of mean omelettes! I recommend the \"baby size\" so you have room for the yummy spuds! The menu also has some classic diner favorites but a few twists set this place apart. Try the pumpkin bread or the banana nut bread instead of toast or pancakes, you'll love it even more with bottomless coffee! The fried potato \"spuds\"... mmmmmight be my latest new craving lol. When they hit your cheese or hollandaise and mix a little with the gravy too, you get yummy poutain! Prices and service are fantastic, location is central and the food can compete with any fancy cafe diner on the strip!",

We 1st went on a Saturday morning...the parking lot was FULL. The line to get in was long. The people leaving looked incredibly happy and overheard many say...God I am so full.  Now, if you are looking for a swanky Las Vegas restaurant...don't come here. If you want one of the BEST breakfasts you have ever had, served by friendly staff...COME HERE!   The owner sat us, we thought the wait would be really long...but this place is deceiving from the outside. It is HUGE inside. A maze of rooms, each in an old country theme.  They are of course known for their omelettesso we had to try. I had the Californian. Sausage, avocado, cheese. Now mind you, this isn't an ordinary omelette...it is a 6 egg omelette, with a TON of ingredients. Normally they say avocado...it's topped with 3 little slices, not here....packed full! The sausage was yummy and the cheese was just the right amount.  Now for the man's order...he is not a huge fan of omelettes...he loves chicken fried steak, potatoes and biscuits and gravy.  They just happen to have a chicken fried steak omelette so he gave it a try. He said it was great...but for him...the gravy is a huge deal. He said and I quote \" It is the best gravy I have ever had in a restaurant!\" The biscuits were cut in half, grilled, buttered and then covered with sausage gravy!!!  I say customer service is a lost art...but you can tell the owner makes this a priority...the staff was so nice and we never had an empty cup. The food was served fast...and when we left they gave us a to go cup for the road!  We have been back, on a Thursday and it was just as busy, just as tasty and friendly. We will be making this our go to place for breakfast and will be taking all of our visitors here to enjoy as well! Thank you for doing breakfast right!!",

Plus, they have specialty breakfast potatoes that are seasoned perfectly and resemble potato chips you eat with a fork.

As the name of the business indicates, tons of egg/omelet options to choose from. Almost too many! Denver Omelets, Crab Omelets, Bacon Omelets... which one sounds best?   The burger. Get the burger! 1/2 pound of beefy goodness in a bun. With a side of potatoes. Have someone in your party order an egg creation and you can switch halfway through your meal. Then you have absolutely nothing to complain about.  For the price, this place is a steal! Average tab per person comes out to about $12 each. And unless you're a \"big bunch\", there's no way you can finish everything on your plate the first time around. Make sure to tip your waitress extra for all of the refills and sweet as pie service.",

I am terrible at getting names- but our server was a sweetie who made us laugh when joking around with my oldest son who clearly did NOT need that extra egg he asked for in his omelet!  Ha!  Never one to back down- he ate the whole thing!  I'm pretty sure he got the Lox- #39.  My other son had The Polak (no joke!).  The menu is pretty funny but the omelets are HUGE- no joke!  My boyfriend was satisfied with his chicken fried steak and eggs but we both thought the gravy was a bit salty.    I had a wonderful time there but my breakfast was my least favorite.  I had eggs over medium and they were a bit under-done.  To be fair, I didn't say a word but I'm sure they would have fixed my order.  I was the only one bothered by the \"surprise\" potato chips.  I LOVE hash browns but when I asked for my hash browns extra crispy, our waitress did not correct me.  However, the chips were tasty!  Now, on the upside, I was in LOVE with the pumpkin bread (which actually filled me up before my breakfast came) so I really didn't care about the other stuff!  Next time,  I will share an omelet with my sweetie!   This is definitely a great departure from casino buffets!  We got there around 10:30 and didn't wait at all.  When we left, however, there was a bit of a line.  The place was packed but, like I said, service was excellent:  efficient, quick, friendly.   Prices were very reasonable.",

We were greeted and asked what we wanted to drink right away. About 5 minutes later the server took our orders and our food was out in less than 10 minutes, I was actually surprised how fast the food came out. I got the California omelette with bacon instead of sausage (and when I asked for that I wasn't given attitude about the change) the cowboy special was the other omelette ordered and it smelled SO GOOD, I had a little taste and it tasted as good as it smelled! Will definitely come back!",

I ordered the corn beef hash which was huge. They don't have hash browns but use these homemade potato chips instead. They are good, but I really wish I had more hash with my hash, if you get me. I tried the banana bread which was warm and delicious too, but very filling. The waitresses were so friendly and attentive. Shermaine was always on it for the coffee refills which is great. Nothing worse than cold or empty coffee.  Definitely a good local spot and one I would gladly come back to patronize.",

I like getting corned beef hash and their menu says the best ever so I obviously went for it. The corned beef hash tastes a lot like canned corned beef. I absolutely despise restaurants that charge 12 dollars for canned food. I'm sure the omelets are fantastic but based on the fact that their corned beef hash is advertised as made fresh, I wouldn't trust anything else being made with fresh ingredients.",

Huge portions, very tasty, great sides, attentive wait staff, all in all a great deal.  It's a bit dim inside, reminiscent of a casino, and the wait for your food can be a bit long when it's busy, but it's well worth it.  The banana bread is some of the best I've had.  My omlette could've served three easily.  i ate half and gave the other half to a friend, who heated it in a microwave and said it was still delicious an hour later.   PS  The photos of the food on this page make it look nasty, but it's really quite good.  Looking at those thin cut fries makes my mouth water in remembrance.",

It was still HUGE (I would hate to see what the full size looked like). The potatoes were yummy and well spiced and the pumpkin bread should have its own food group. I also enjoyed an orange juice concoction with what I can only guess was sprite and spices (weird I know)....it was delightful. The server was a little cutie pie. You could tell she was quite young (probably 15 or 16) and just super friendly and adorable. I felt bad  because the table behind us was really rude to her (I think they were from Jersey). I wanted to get up and slap the mean and nasty chick upside the head (my mommy instinct kicking in) but she handled it well.  Will come back here when I get to that neck of the woods.",

    "text": "So the surrounding neighborhood is nothing to write home about.  Reminds me of LA neighborhoods in the 80s.  But if you step into this restaurant, you instantly are in another place, and it feels comfortable.  Yeah, everything is kinda woodsy, but the food is where this place really shines.    We start off with coffee and water with our meals, or as our waiter calls it, \"a stiff coffee and a water chaser.\"  Hey, this place has personality too!  \"Waiter!  Another round !\"    Omelets are huge and very delicious.  The Californian omelet has avocado, sausage and jack cheese.  American comfort food at a good price!  The only drawback is that I miss the hash browns.  They have \"spuds\" which look basically like potato chips.    The chili is very good.  It has a little kick, but it was made for most people to enjoy, so it is not too hot.    Sandwiches  and burgers are also very good.  They come with spuds too.  Why can't they have french fries?  You can check them out on the web.  <a href=\"/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.omelethouse.net%2F&s=aa93fd8de7924e9a616b32fd893fbbfaef6f5819692555da8e565b4ec344ea8a\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">omelethouse.net</a>",

    "text": "A pseudo-vegetarian POV:  Pluses: our server was really sweet and accommodating, no wait in line on a Monday lunch hour, lots of options for the ovo-lacto. I liked my guac omelet (just the right amt of spice), and Boyfriend got the spinach one. He wishes he got the artichoke one because it was pretty standard, BUT both of our omelets were well-filled w/ ingredients. They use real butter on their toast, too, yay! (Dont' start on me as to why I didn't get their famous bread, grrr)  Minuses: parking was surprisingly full. We had to circle twice before finding parking. Their coffee wasn't to my liking, but if you like your coffee really thin and watery (like my mom does) you won't mind it.  Other: the decor reminded me of stopping at one of those random places off the 5 on your way down to L.A., but in a good way. Lots of junk to look at on the walls, and try to get a booth.  Can't speak for the rest of the menu, but I would definitely come back...esp after a night of drinking a grip of champagne (groan).",

I'm a vegetarian so i looked at the menu prior to going,  and the selection looked good and BONUS!  At the bottom of their online menu it said that you get a free entree on your birthday,  and it was my birthday (<a href=\"/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2FI.D.in&s=3749d3c9b59f1bee61f2ba33a945bec519b813c6c39717cfc33111274e519440\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">I.D.in</a> hand in case they asked) so we went!  It took a few minutes of us standing at the door to be acknowledged or sat.  However, the gentleman that  ended up seating us was very friendly and likeable. That's about the only positive thing i have to say.   Our server greeted us relatively quickly and seemed sweet. We ordered water and when she asked us to order we informed her we had never been there a needed just another couple of minutes to make our final selections. At least 15 minutes passed and she still hadn't come back.  As i was getting ready to go to the ladie's room,  she popped out of nowhere and we ordered. Appetizer: we ordered fried zucchini with cheese dipping sauce and ranch. Took a while for it to come out,  but tasted pretty good. I had a veggie omelet and my mom had a Denver omelet.  The omelets were HUGE,  and were decent at best. Nothing to write home about.  They were served with what looked and tasted like undercooked,  homemade potato chips. Still kind of raw, very greasy, and tasteless. The waitress dropped the bill and i politely mentioned again the it was my birthday and inquired about the free birthday entree. She said,  \"oh, we don't do that anymore,  our  website isn't up-to-date\". She even mentioned that it still had old (cheaper) pricing on the items and a lady came in with not enough money to pay her bill because she looked at it, too. She then told me that she would go ask the manager. 10 minutes later she came back and said \"I'm sorry,  he said no\". Are you freaking kidding me?! Aside from not honoring something they are still advertising,  he didn't even have the decency to come to the table and tell us no, himself? He made the waitress do it?! She then informed me that her dad is one of the owners and that she told him what was going on and he said he will take it off the menu asap.  They just lost 2 potential life-long customers over a 10 dollar omelet and an m.i.a. manager.",

    "text": "My gf and I were craving some good breakfast foods and there was nothing on the strip that would satisfy our tummies unless we were ready to dish out some $$$.  So we decided to go out to the Las Vegas Premium outlets and found this place just a few blocks away.  It wasn't too hard to find as there was a huge sign out front and the decor gave it a real local's feel.  When we walked in the host was very friendly, asking us if we were from out of town and joking with us as he showed us to our table.  The coffee was good but the real kicker was the Banana Bread.  It came out piping hot and the texture was melt in your mouth.  And what is even more awesome as you can have it as a side if you order an Omelet!    As a main dish I had ordered the Cowboy Omelet which was all chili.  I decided to order this as there was a rodeo and the American Country Awards going on at the same time so I felt like getting into the festivities.  My girlfriend had ordered the Lox Benedict so that we can sample two of the top recommended dishes.  Both our orders came with a hefty side of home made potato chips that were delicious.  The Omelet wasn't heavy (as i thought it was going to be) and the chili portion was perfect to the size of the dish.  It wasn't too spicy but it was definitely satisfying.  The Lox was soft and the bread underneath wasn't soaking in the egg as it kept its fluffiness.    All in all it was a great little place to eat at if you are on the way to the outlets for a great meal and I definitely want to try the rest of the dishes there.",

Kevin (the owner/manager I think?) greeted us immediately, as did two other staff members, and we were seated in a great booth (normally reserved for the Mayor of Las Vegas!) right away. Every host and server we spoke to was warm and attentive. Our server, Devynn, was outstanding! She answered our questions about the extensive menu and we chose to order two 'baby' size omelets, made with three eggs instead of six. They were still huge and delicious! The banana bread was SO GOOD. Our daughter had a yummy pancake. The drink server was always on hand preemptively offering coffee refills. The good came out hot and fast.

    "text": "My fiance and I have always had a weekend tradition of going out to different breakfast joints every Saturday morning. We can say with certainty we have tried at least 90% of all of the breakfast places in the Las Vegas-Henderson metro area, and we have no reason to return to any of them after we decided to stick with the Omelet House.  Unlike the most other breakfast spots like The Cracked Egg or The Egg and I, where on a weekend you will almost certainly have a 25-35 minute wait for a seat (generally the wait is outside), I have personally never waited for longer than 8 minutes to get a seat here, even when the line goes out the door. We are seated in a variety of interesting rooms with lots of neat old decor (think grandma's house), and drink orders are taken immediately, no waiting for a server! They serve topnotch Farmer Brothers coffee, which is a major plus for me since I'm a big coffee drinker. The menus are simple and descriptive, and offer all the usual breakfast fare, with a major emphasis on the omelettes. We have a few favorite servers there, and we usually get Devynn (hope I'm right on the spelling) who is nothing short of fantastic and kind. Orders are taken quickly, and I have never waited more than 10 minutes for my order to arrive (I time it every weekend, just to see if maybe I'm wrong, thankfully I'm not!)  It's impossible to describe the food without it sounding like hyperbole, but I can genuinely and honestly say this is the best breakfast I have ever had. I've seen a lot of restaurants boast about their portions, and the value of those portions, but Omelet House cannot be beat in that regard. The omelettes are simply huge, and packed to the gills with whatever ingredients you like (and trust me, whatever you want, they have). I can't recall ever finishing an omelette in one sitting, come to think of it. I usually get a #9 bacon and cheddar omelette, plus I add chorizo. I couldn't tell you if it's a four-egg omelette, because it looks like they used a half-dozen eggs to make it. They also serve excellent seasoned fried potatoes with every omelette, sort of like really thick potato chips fried and seasoned with a salty garlicky mixture. Generally the potatoes are heaped on the plate to the edges, even on top of part of your omelette (which gives you a few potatoes with cheese on them!). They serve steaming breads with their entrees, currently the choice is between pumpkin or banana bread, either of which are fantastic. The portions are large enough that I usually take half of the omelette home with some potatoes and reheat it in the late afternoon for lunch or dinner.  As another important point, the value of what you get for your dollar is incredible. We pay $29 plus tip for this gigantic meal, which is basically two meals for each of us since we have a ton of leftovers (not quite Hash House A-Go-Go huge, but pretty close, and much cheaper!). The crowd is also much more mellow and friendly here, with lots of Rotary Club, motorcycle club, Elks Lodge, etc. folks coming here to enjoy some socializing. If you are worried about obnoxious kids and loud diners, you won't find them here. Just considerate older adults for the most part, which is why we love to come here (we're probably their youngest customers, we're both 28!) I also get the sense that the emplyees are well-treated, and some have been there for a very long time, which speaks for itself. I know that cooking, serving food, cleaning floors, and dealing with entitled customers can be very hard, but I've never seen it on anyone who works here. Everyone is very respectful and kind, and the manager is very direct and firm, but also respects the people who work here, and I can appreciate the good business sense.  In all, this is the best place to enjoy a good breakfast and chat with your friends and loved ones, and it's a great place to start a weekend breakfast tradition. If you do, we'll see you there every weekend, because they can consider us customers for life.",

    "text": "My fiance and I have been hopping around breakfast joints every Saturday for the past like, 2 years. Thats kind of our thing. Once we had Omelet House, we stopped going to the other places.. I mean I would consider myself a professional breakfast connoisseur with all of the places Ive been to in vegas. I have never been to a better place in my life. Here is why: You walk in the door on a saturday morning at like 8-8:30.. immediately seated. If its after that, you're looking at a 10 minute wai.. if that. The hostess is always sweet, the bussers fill your coffee when its half way down, the servers are friendly and on point. Our favorite server is Devinn (not sure of her spelling) but she is absolutely sweet. We get her pretty often, but would still vouch for any other server in that joint. She subtly remembers us which is cool because she knows we are regulars but still services everyone else like they are too.  NOW..the food. Lets just say, you get BEYOND what you pay for. This is literally THEE omelet house. There are so many choices. Not only are their omelettes delicious, but everything else I have tried was delightfully satisfying. Their portions are huge! Even ordering the baby size I still cant finish it, but its also priced very low. I dont mind splurging on the tip!  I personally love the decor. I was a little weirded out at first, but it kinda reminds me of my grandmas house. Plus its pretty eye catching and you wonder where it all came from. I will forever continue my Saturday rituals at The Omelete House.",

    "text": "I got the Lox Benedict and the bf got the Cowboy Special Omelet.   I never thought breakfast could pack so much flavor but this place proved me wrong! It was just amazingly tasty right from the beginning.   The chili in the Cowboy Special was flavorful and had the right amount of spice without being too hot. Beans and finely ground beef in and delicious chili sauce all stuffed into this gigantic omelet that we couldn't finish - HEAVEN.   My Lox Benedict had the creamiest sauce on top of the softest muffin. The salmon was a great touch to the meal. I found myself using the extra potatoes that came on the side to finish up the sauce.   We also ordered banana bread that was piping hot when it was delivered to us. How can so much banana go into bread?????? What is this magic???????  Service here is friendly and has a home-grown feel to it. Save some money and come here to enjoy and chill breakfast that won't bust your wallet.",

It tastes weak and burnt at the same time. Quite an achievement. No excuses for a hash house charging all the money. I ordered the corned beef hash with poached eggs. I did not receive poached eggs. I got something called \"steam basted\" eggs. They looked like fried eggs without the frying. Unappetizing. Finally I'm not sure what they are thinking with their potatoes. They are potato chips cut just a hair too thick to cook up crispy so most arrive just full of oil, soggy and stuck together. The single worst potato dish I have ever been served in a restaurant. That's 'two worst ever served' for this joint. English Muffin was the cheapest store brand variety. This place was extremely busy. And the reviews here are mostly positive but from my perspective it is in desperate need of an intervention.",

I ordered the waffle with bananas, walnuts and whip. He ordered ham and eggs. While we waited the sweet waitress Jennifer brought us a slice of banana nut bread with butter. That certainly did the trick to wake up my taste buds. They were screaming: More!  More! Did I mention I was dragging from the night before? When our food came the potatoes in my husband plate were homemade potato chips. Wow, they were the best I have ever had! The delishiousness set before me was so scrumptious! The food was really good my taste buds were screaming...Thank you!",

Out of all the omelets to choose from I ordered the \"Just Cheese\" which is an omelet with your choice of cheese, but I added mushrooms since I love my mushrooms. When the waiter brought out my omelet, man was it huge (good to share with someone). I even ordered the baby size, an I was full after my 5th bite. The potato chips that it comes with is really good, it was crispy and fresh. The waiter forgot my pumpkin bread, I did remind her that I never got it, even though I knew I had no room in my stomach I just wanted to try it. Pumpkin bread was really delicious and you can tell that it's made fresh.   I am definitely coming back to order the mushroom burger! That's a must try if your a mushroom fan (the very first time I came here I ordered the mushroom burger so I know it's really good).",

My husband's omlette tasted vaguely of shrimp, which made us wonder if the pan had been cleaned.  I'm sure there are better breakfasts in LV.  I",

I tried the Lobster Fest w/ banana bread and their addictive Potato Spuds and to be honest, with you, couldn't remember when I'd had a better omelet, I walked away stuffed and raving about my meal.  I consider a few things in Vegas \"must try,\" like Sammy's LA Pastrami & Burgers or the Oyster Bar in Palace Station, and without a doubt Omelet House has joined the list.  Considering how the good the food is here and the proximity to Downtown and the Strip, it's well worth a drive to have an amazing, reasonably priced breakfast.",

The potatoes are my favorite in the city, even in the country, hands down no questions asked!  But the reason I continue to go here is the PUMPKIN NUT BREAD.........what!!!???!!!???!!!  I cannot get enough nor can I duplicate this recipe at home; makes for a great excuse to go back! The decor kinda makes me nuts........lots of STUFF everywhere, but that's not what's on my mind while I'm eating there.  And the hostess, the older woman that works during the week................LOVE her!!!  I can go six months without eating there (at one point it had been over a year) and she still remembered me!  I felt special!  It's the little things like that, that make me want to go back over and over again! =)",

    "text": "Truly one of the last original, local, family-owned breakfast secrets! If you've had your fill of the cookie-cutter, mediocre, chain-like, diner-style restaurants; and your craving some good food, personality, and kitch, then you have to check out the Omelet House.   Tucked away in an otherwise, run-down, and non-descript strip mall near UMC, the Omelet House has an extensive menu, just broad enough to please its rather large, & eclectic following.   Be prepared to wait a few minutes, although the restaurants multitude of seating areas seem to have branched off over the years into hidden hallways and secret garden rooms.  Basic good, hot coffee (complete with staff who seem solely dedicated to the task of keeping all the cups full) helps to keep your growling stomach at bay, while a comedically-described, fun list of deliciously tempting omelets ranging from the simple Southwestern to the brazen, 'Kitchen Sink' (comprised of who knows what), will only make you more hungry, as you toil away about what to order.  My recommendation is the Chorizo Omelet (there is some unspoken harmony between eggs & really good chorizo that I find irresistible), but for those of you calorie counters - just along to enjoy the scenery & conversation, you will be equally pleased by egg whites filled with whatever you like...  Arrive with an open-mind and an empty stomach and you're sure to have an interesting & tasty experience.  For the best people-watching, try a weekend if you don't mind a short wait; then, while you anxiously await your fluffy yellow taste of breakfast-heaven, entertain your eyes with all of the bizarre items that have been lovingly collected and hung on the walls around you - some of them even for sale!",

Their bacon is done just right, crispy and lots of it.  All their plates of food are large and with the breakfast comes a choice of banana or pumpkin bread. The place is large, with room after room filled with locals. Both times we went there during the week the place was packed. We'd be here weekly if we lived in Vegas. Which, thank god, we do not.",

Also tried the fried zucchini as a starter. The tempura they used for the zucchini was just the right amount. It reminds me of the tempura that Japanese restaurants use. The half size was more than enough for two people. The Omelet was extremely big. It was also really good. Even the side of chips were made fresh. I also liked how they had three selections of hot sauce. I didn't finish my Omelet because I wanted to save room for my banana nut bread. This restaurant has one of the best nut breads I've ever tried in my life. The service was really amazing. I want to go back to this place again. I just think that their menu is way too big. It seemed like there were over 100 items. Lol so it was really hard to decide. Overall, my experience was amazing. Can't wait to go back.",

I ordered the chicken fried steak with potatoes, eggs over medium and a biscuit which would normally go good with gravy. The Chicken fried steak was yummy and so was the gravy but what was horrible were the potatoes which were under the chicken fried steak. The potatoes were so greasy I couldn't even eat them. Second complaint was the biscuit which was like a dinner roll!   I confronted the hostess who took the unfinished potatoes and showed the cook. She advised the waitress later bc she wasn't around and she advised me that was is the way their biscuits are made and she also explained she didn't know what happen to the potatoes which are usually crispy. Nothing was offered like new potatoes or even a discount which was shocking.   I still left a minimal tip because I didn't feel it was the waitress's fault but was disapointed with the end result!",

    "text": "Wow.  I tried this place on a whim, and was NOT disappointed.  It's larger than you expect.  It's tucked away in some tiny mall, out of the way, and completely unassuming.  Inside, the place is surprisingly HUGE, and very homey.  You can tell the place has been there for a while.  For starters, we got hooked up with a nice slice of pumpkin bread.  It's not overly sweet, but it has a nice amount of spice to make it incredibly tasty.  Then the meal came.  The missus got chicken fried steak, and it was delicious.  I got lobster eggs benedict.  Honestly, I was expecting something lame and wimpy, as every restaurant thinks a few little sprinkles of shredded lobster here and there suffices in any related meal.  What I got was CHUNKS.  Big, wonderful chunks of tasty sweet lobster on both parts, and the entire experience was just awesome.  I more than got what I paid for.  Prices are great, service is fast, the staff is friendly, and the wait time to be seated was surprisingly short.  It was nice to eat in  place that had a little personality, and you could tell they've been around for a while.  After eating breakfast there, I could see why.  This weekend, \"whims\" paid off, and I have a new place to frequent.  It's nice to know that I can still find \"new\" things in the neighborhood. Recommended.",

The staff is also very friendly and there was a nice kid that was selling newspapers by the door.  I can't believe they had so many omelette variations on the menu!  If you are an omelette fiend then you have to come here!  They average around $10 but they are seriously big.  I don't like how they have a split charge, but I guess their omelettes are fancy enough for that.  I mean, where else can you get a lobster omelette?  Not IHOP.  I got the King of Hearts and it was amazing!  It was huge and loaded with yummy artichoke hearts, tomatoes, mushrooms, onions, fantastic!  It also came with these potato chip things.  Potato circles?  Potato slices?  They weren't crispy but not completely soft either.  Well no breakfast is truly complete without some potato side-dish so I ate them anyway.  I also got the pumpkin nut bread which was good too, but probably would have been better for me if it didn't have nuts (ew).  It was very warm when it came out and heavily spiced.  Next time I'm in Vegas I have to stop by here again.  It's refreshing after eating at a ton of casino buffets.",

I ordered the 38 special omelet and it was packed with delicious sausage, ham, and bacon. The generous cheddar and jack cheese on top was perfect. I was not expecting to be blown away but this is definitely a place I will be visiting every time I travel to Vegas from now on. I also got the pumpkin nut bread with my plate and it was equally amazing as the omelet. My boyfriend had some pancakes and I was able to steal a bite of that. Honestly the best pancake I've ever had as well! I can't say enough good things about this restaurant!  SERVICE - Our server was very friendly and nice. I asked her what the top omelets were and among the ones she listed, the 38 special was one of them. It was an excellent recommendation and I can't wait to try the others.  I love the mom and pop feel of this restaurant and the food is amazing! I could eat breakfast here every single day.",

I hit the mother lode - this place was absolutely the right choice.  From the moment I walked in and was greeted by the hostess, to the time I ordered my meal from my waitress (Amanda, I think?) everything about this place oozed with customer service.    I had the lobster omelette and had pumpkin bread instead of toast.  The omelette was fluffy, loaded with lobster and avocado and had just the right amount of cheese in it.  Oh, and it also came with potatoes that were sort of like home made potato chips.  Cooked perfectly, not dripping with deep fat fryer residue.    I had to pace myself to enjoy every bite.  Service was attentive but not over the top.  My Waitress seemed to know exactly when to stop and refill my coffee or water.  This is THE place to have breakfast.  Now, sadly, others will know my secret.  Go to this place.  You won't regret it.",

    "text": "I wanted to leave only 2.5 stars, however it was not an option. Omelet house is a place I visit each timeI visit Las Vegas. The omelets are large in portion and the chips are the best chips I've ever had. The pumpkin bread is so amazing I forgo calorie counting when dining here. Sounds like a 5 star worthy rating right?   Wrong, and here's why.   The restaurant closes at 3pm. I visited the restaurant this past Saturday and Sunday, with a group of 6, both days arriving near closing.  On Saturday our food wss great with extra to take home,  however several in our group noticed a \"rushed\" tone and energy from our server. As always, we went back Sunday and I ordered the exact same omelet. An egg white omelet with added lobster and additional veggies. Our food came and I had no lobster in my omelet.  Now, due to many food restrictions and intolerances, I suggested coming here as I know the lobster omelet was satisfying and filling. However, when i told the waitress there was no lobster, she said it was in there because she told her chefs to add it, and she rushed off. I dug more through my omelet looking for lobster, and still no lobster! I told the waitress again and she pointed to egg white and said \"theres the lobster. Its shredded\". The lobster is not shredded. I just had the omelet the day before. I pointed to my friend next to me and said look at her lobster omelet,  it's not shredded. She said, well i told them to put it in there. She then went to confirm with the cooks and they said they put it in there. And offered to take off the $5 upcharge for added lobster.  Herein lies the problem:  Typically when a restaurant gets your order wrong, they can remake or fix your meal.  Because they close at 3, I was informed that my food could not be fixed because the chefs have now left! I dug through my omelet until it was scrambled eggs on a plate and there was no lobster. I told the waitress that i specifically came here and ordered this for the lobster. She took my plate to the back to the managee and it was then it was determined, yes in fact there was NO lobster in my omelet! Yes, the waitress removed the omelet from my bill,  however I left hungry, disappointed and frustrated with the service.  My suggestion to the restaurant:  The waitress takes immediate action if a plate is cooked incorrectly, especially before closing.  The cooks should not leave until the waitress verifies that all plates are prepared as ordered.  Be mindful of your tone, you're still on the clock.  The manager should address an issue with the customer directly. It makes for better customer service  My suggestion to patrons:  Dont visit just before closing. Or be prepared for subpar service.  I do not know if I'll be visiting here again after this experience.",

So of course, I was looking for a spot that was nowhere near the strip when heading out for breakfast.  Found this place and was immediately impressed with their food and portions!  Ordered an omelet, which came with potato chips and freshly baked bread (I chose banana).  Although I wish some of the chips were a bit crispier, I love potato in general so I just kept eating it up, with a side of ranch, of course.  The freshly baked banana bread though was so good!  They don't joke around with the portions of this place.  Needless to say, both the boyfriend and I had to take to-go boxes, and if you've ever seen my boyfriend, he's not usually the to-go box type of guy.  The servers are attentive and the owner is very friendly.  Make sure to make your way to this place before 11am though because anytime after that, you'll be sure to have a wait.  Oh and make sure to bring an appetite and an empty stomach!",

I had the chicken fried steak (which is pretty much my favorite breakfast) & the girlfriend had huevos rancheros (didn't try but looked good). Overall, the food was very good & the place has quite the kitschy ambiance. I prefer chicken fried steak to be an actual cut-of-meat steak rather than a ground steak product. The former is rare & this place served the latter. The gravy, however, was distinctively outstanding & the potatoes, served as home-style chips, were pretty good too. If you're looking for breakfast in Vegas & not in the mood for the $50 buffet with the obligatory gluttony that accompanies it, Omelet House is a very good, much lower cost option that still serves up ample portions.",

I had the huevos rancheros louie style because I rarely have an opportunity to eat something smothered in green chile and it was fantastic. The only bad thing about my meal is that I had to chose tortillas as the choice of bread instead of the banana nut or pumpkin bread. They served huge slices of homemade breads that were delicious.",

    "text": "It was right before our team photo shoot and we were hungry!  We decided to go to the Omelet House as it offered either breakfast or lunch.  We have approximately 72441675267 Omelet House locations in Vegas and I've never been to one before so I was excited for the Yelp review opportunity.    When I parked, I was a little sketched out.  It's in a very interesting strip mall in the back corner.  When I walked in, I noticed a very outdated, old place.  Stain carpets all over the place, light wood all over the place.  In the front area, there are benches to sit on and next to it, you have a glass case with miss matched items for sale.  The place is seriously outdated and the perfect opportunity for a modern makeover.  I was expecting a staff that was older, who probably worked there since they opened back in 1954 (date is incorrect and placed there only for joking purposes).  What I got instead, was a variety of older and super young hip looking servers.  Our server was a tall, skinny guy, good looking and younger.  He was seriously an awesome server.  Super attentive to his tables, super nice and when our food came out, he took the time to review his notes and give us our plates, without yelling the order out to the table.  As a previous server myself, I really appreciated that.  He didn't have a name tag, so I can't call his name out in this review.  It didn't stop there.  The other supporting servers around, took part in helping each other out.  Refilling our coffees, checking to see if we need anything throughout our meals.  I loved the service!!    For my meal, I teamed up with a coworker and got the following (Don't judge):  The Californian omelet and added onions and mushrooms for $9.99, the Eggs Benedict Florentine for $9.79 and a Full Stack Buttermilk Pancakes for $6.39.  Let's start with the omelet.  It was HUGE!!  Sausage, avocado and jack cheese with onions and mushrooms.  What a beautiful omelet.  You literally can save a half for later.  Jack cheese is the best cheese for this type of omelet. So savory, so good!  The Eggs Benedict has two medium eggs, with spinach and mushrooms and topped with their light Hollandaise sauce.  I love me a good Benedict and this one was no exception.  Although the Hollandaise sauce is light, they did pack on.  It was super flavorful, but maybe just a little too much.  The spinach and mushrooms took the Benedict to a whole new level, I was loving it!!!  Then you have their pancakes.  Three large cakes, super fluffy and moist.  Their syrup seems store bought, but it came to our table warm so it really made the cakes amazing!  Highly recommend these dishes!  The moral of the story, don't ever judge a book by it's cover.  This place is a gem.  When you're in the area, hang a right into the parking lot, grab a table and check them out.  You will not be disappointed!!!  I wasn't :)  Thanks guys!",

If you haven't eaten at the omelette house what a shame you missed out all these years.   They serve breakfast & lunch with lots of delicious omelettes, good sandwiches and of course the banana nut bread and the pumpkin bread is worthy of going just for that. The names for the different omelettes are pretty funny  It's tucked in the back of a shopping center. From the looks of the exterior you would never dream of all the delicious things behind the doors. Family owned and operated it has kind of a grandma's kitchen feel with wood decor and pictures of the family on the walls as you walk in the door.very busy around lunch time so come early. Lots of seating and they get you through during lunch pretty quick, it's just busy.  I had the Californian omelette and it had sausage avocado and Jack cheese the home cut potatoes are thin cut like chips with seasoning. My wife had a omelette with peppers and cheddar make sure you order the baby omelette unless you're extremely hungry the omelettes are big!   Great for breakfast",

Everything tasted delicious and very well portioned (they have a plate \"sizes\" in case you're starving or just got the hangrys) These folks are family/locally owned (a big plus for us locals to support each other!)

It was around brunch time and found the Omelet House on my Yelp app, sounds good!  The ambiance had the homey feeling, with the picture frames and figurines on the wall. The chairs were sort of janky, but I didn't care. For the food, they have a large selection of entrees, especially for the omelettes. My parents ordered off the omelette menu and my brother had the $5.99 breakfast special. They also have other breakfast options if you're not an omelette fan like me. I ordered the huevos rancheros.  The food came out and wow, the omelettes my parents ordered were GINORMOUS! How many eggs do they use to make a serving? Looked like half a dozen. It also came along with potatoes that are sliced into coin shapes, such an interesting take on homefries. However, my brother $5.99 breakfast special looked so small, which my parents donated some of their omelette for him. My huevos rancheros was perfectly portioned and loved it. the tortilla chips were a great addition to scoop up the refried beans, salsa and runny egg yolk on the plate. My parents couldn't finish their omelettes even though they gave a portion to my brother.   Overall, great hole-in-a-wall joint. Definitely recommend those who are bulking up on protein or just simply love eggs.",

Menu contains all sorts of dishes from breakfast to lunch, from Mexican to polish.  Definitely something new to try each time you come.  This place gives excellent service.  When I'm eating here it feels as if I'm eating at my lola's (grandma) house with all the antique collections.  The feel is very warm and cozy.  As soon as you come in to the door you're greeted right away and seated.  So many people come and go.  Only thing, worst time is around 8am. All medical students come and eat breakfast there.  But as quickly as they seat you and you order...your food comes in less than 10 minutes!   As for the food, I had the \"egg white special.\" not your typical breakfast size.  Even when you split the food, your plate is still overflowing! I like how their potatoes are like chips...quite different!  Most of all, the favorite to have here is their pumpkin nut bread. Comes warm and fresh from the oven. Every time you come, it's must!  Over all, excellent and quick service, great and delicious food and cheap prices!!!",

There are a lot of fun decorations inside so the atmosphere is really quite charming. Service was also very friendly and attentive, though in retrospect, we should have stated at the beginning of the meal that we wanted separate checks.   The menu is quite large (literally, the double-sided single page menu is printed on oversize paper), and as the name of the restaurant suggests, they have quite a few omelet options, many with clever names. They also have a full breakfast and lunch menu.  I ordered the lobster benedict, which took a while to prepare but was tasty (though I wish it came with some fruit and/or vegetables). Everyone else seemed to enjoy their dishes as well.  Not open for dinner, but I recommend coming for a hearty breakfast, brunch, or lunch!",

The chips on the side were good if they had a lot of seasoning on it or were soaked in the hollandaise sauce but otherwise didn't add much to the breakfast. The pumpkin bread was pretty good though. The service was okay as well. One spilled water on us, which happens, but didn't do much to help us clean it up. Overall the place was ok and I would go again to try something else, but with all the great Vegas breakfasts, it won't be my first choice.",

Wait staff: friendly, attentive and very pleasant.  Food: Lobster Benedict was delicious! Chicken fried steak with eggs was also perfect and tender.  Homemade chips in lieu of hash browns were a welcome change.  We visit Vegas 2-3 times a year and will definitely return next time!  Thanks Omelette House!",

And choose the homemade banana bread or the pumpkin bread that comes with it. I say share the plate! I'm a huge coffee drinker and that took one of the stars down. Coffee was very weak, if the coffee was just a little bit better this place should of gotten a 5 star. Price was was great for what you get. We got the 38 special, country fried omelet and the kitchen sink. Place is a small old school place. Servers are awesome!",

This is the family atmosphere here with customers and workers alike.  For example, police officers come in frequently for breakfast, and we've seen Sheriff Lombardo and Commissioner Sisolak. They're all very friendly, saying hello or starting conversations.   Constant coffee and water refills are still going around all the time.  Everything on the menu is hearty servings. I'm always switching it up between the omelets, French toast, and breakfast special (on the weekdays).  What I like the most, they accommodate requests. I know the potatoes can get soggy, so I request them extra crispy and they're served to perfection. Same with the baby Greek omelet, since the feta cheese can make it soggy I ask for it to be cooked well done. If your first time here wasn't to your liking, I recommend you give it another shot and request how you like certain things, they don't disappoint :)",

The food was well worth the walk to and from this establishment.   The restaurant is tucked away on a busy street and from the signs on the other businesses doors pointing to where the Omelet House is located, they've been mistaken for the restaurant as it's not clearly identified from the street once you've reached the address.  The look and feel of the restaurant is very old school Vegas and that was part of its appeal if you ask me.   The wait staff was quite attentive and the hospitality infectious.  There were plenty memorabilia from yesteryear such as photos of stars in their heyday frequenting the joint.  Handwritten signs adorned the entranceway and newspaper articles and reviews recommending the place hung on walls.    The menu had more than just omelets and I tried the corned beef hash with some fried potatoes that the menu stated was Rip Taylor's favorite!  The waitress was very cordial and suggested the banana bread to me and I chose English muffins.  In a not so subtle way before my plate came out to the table, she provided me with a complimentary slice of warm banana bread.  She was right to recommend it as it was heavenly. I didn't order it because I'm fond of my mother's but it can easily go south in restaurants.  This was good and I advised her of that and thanked her for believing it would be enjoyed enough to comp me a slice.    The food was well seasoned and delish.  I really enjoyed the atmosphere and all of the kitsch decorations and flea market feel of each booth.  I would recommend giving it a try. And I can see why the potatoes were Rip Taylor's favorite.  Yummo.",

Come with an appetite because portions are huge especially with the Omelette's. They have over 30 types to choose from!! So we settled on the following:   - Joe's Special Omelette (Ground Beef, Jack Cheese, Onion, spinach and secret seasoning)  - Biscuits and Gravy (Best I've had) - Pancake Stacks - French Toast   Everything was delicious! Most plates come with their form of hash browns which look like home potato chips. Amazing!  Plenty of parking; great service; reasonable prices; great food!  We will stop in again anytime we're in town. Absolutely worth the 10 minute drive from the strip.",

    "text": "Ah, the good old Omelet House. It's been there (in a crowded parking lot near all the medical buildings on Charleston) since I was young, so I assure you they are as set in their ways as I am.  And as my own circle of acquaintance can attest, this can be a double edged sword.  The decor never really changes; it's deliberately homey feel is attributed to a plethora of kitchen kitsch (some of which is for sale) displayed throughout. And don't be fooled by the cozy little room at the front entrance- this place is a lot bigger than you think. Still, it has fast, friendly service, constant coffee refills, and the feeling that you're in a little diner in a small town. So far, so good.  They have both lunch and breakfast menus, but as you might suspect  from the name, omelets are their specialty. And they do have a wide variety, from plain to the classic \"Flatlander\", which features liver, grunion lips, and other exotic delicacies for the bargain price of $69. (Gotta love a place with a sense of humor).Has anyone ever ordered it? Probably. So rare to see grunion anymore. At any rate, these babies are HUGE. I believe they use 6 eggs and are not chintzy with the fillings. You would think a greedy person such as myself would show more enthusiasm, but unfortunately, in order to cook these behemoths through, it seems necessary to get the outsides brown and a little rubbery. And, they are served with the house version of fried potatoes, which are so thin they seem more like half-cooked potato chips. Some folks must like them but I am not a fan.  Now, back in the day, you could sub fresh fruit at no charge, and get their yummy pumpkin bread in lieu of toast. You still can, but now it costs extra. and their \"free meal on your birthday\" policy has also gone the way of rotary phones and analog TV.  So, as my circle of acquaintance can attest, the changes we do make as we age are probably not for the better.",

    "text": "Longevity is a funny thing here in Vegas -- with how often buildings, resorts and houses are torn down and imploded, it's hard to find places from the original Vegas that haven't been modified or altered in some way. To find a place that's been operating for that long is similarly a rare occurrence. Enter Omelet House -- a family-owned restaurant that's been in operation since 1979. Walking into the restaurant, you feel like you've gone back in time to those early Vegas days! And yet, 40 years of operation has not dulled their food quality at all -- the food here is SO much better than a lot of the chain breakfast joints and diners that have popped up everywhere in town.  My work training brought me to the vicinity of the original Omelet House, and with how I missed breakfast this morning, I opted to stop in during my lunch break -- and it was busy! It takes you a while to be seated depending on how packed the restaurant is, but they're good about making sure you're seated quickly. Ask for Suzzette if you want quality service, too!  For my brunch, I ordered the cinnamon apple-stuffed French toast with chocolate chips, eggs over medium with sausage, and breakfast chips. Of course, Omelet House is known for its omelets -- it's in the name, for crying out loud! -- but they have other breakfast and lunch options like sandwiches, burgers and the aforementioned French toast if you want something different.  Suzzette was attentive to my needs and was helpful in explaining the delay on my order -- there were multiple parties in the restaurant at the time of my order -- but when I got my actual order I could see why they took their time.   The French toast was packed with cinnamon apples and cream cheese, and they didn't skimp on the chocolate! It was so fluffy and light despite being French toast, and I didn't even need the butter and maple syrup for it -- though I did eat the other half of the toast with it. The eggs were perfectly over medium -- something I have trouble finding when I go to other breakfast places -- and the sausage was perfectly juicy and flavorful. The breakfast potatoes were also delicious -- they were seasoned chips, some of them crisp and some of them soft and tender. Some people might have problems with soggy chips, but I actually like that there were some soft and tender potato chips among the potatoes, so for me the entire breakfast was perfect. I know now why this place is so popular now.  Omelet House is now entering its 40th year of service, and in a town where hotels, resorts and restaurants come and go, I understood in that hour of brunch why Omelet House was and continues to be such a Vegas mainstay. My only regret was that I couldn't linger for long since I had to get back to work! But if you ever want a good breakfast / brunch or at least experience a bit of old Vegas for yourself, I don't see any better place to go to than Omelet House. Give them a try -- you won't regret it!",

Talk about classic Vegas. This place is original. Old school decorations.   We were waited on right away. The young man was on it when he brought me iced tea w a cup of ice.   I had the lobster eggs Benedict. I was not prepared for the eggs Benedict explosion that was about to have. This is your muffin, hollandaise sauce, eggs, avocado and lobster. All cooked to perfection and the hollandaise sauce. The potatoes it comes w were really good too. This was only $12.99 too and came w a good amount of lobster. My husband got an inlet and it was huge!  So much meat and cheese. This place knows how to hook it up w a meal.",

The avocado was fresh. I enjoyed that they weren't stingy with it; the omelet had plenty in it! My sister had the waffle, which I loved! It was fluffy and sweet, they consistency was perfect. I appreciated that it wasn't soggy or thin. The pumpkin bread I did not find as flavorful as I thought it would be after reading all the reviews. I found it to be bland.   Service wasn't anything out of the ordinary, if anything, the hostess walked by us twice before saying a word to us, which is quite rude. Acknowledge your customers. The waitress was more attentive.   I would go back to try a few other items on the menu!  Date of service: 9/13/2014",

This was really really good!!! And even included chilli which made everything better. GET THIS.   LOBSTER FEST: omelet with lobster, cheese, and avocado. The lobster was really good and they are definitely generous with the lobster. However, I wouldn't order this again. Lobster is a pretty bland flavor in general, so is egg.... Making the omelet uninteresting. The individual components of this omelet were good, but all together, it didn't fit well.   JACK OF ALL TRADES: burger with guac, lettuce, tomatoes (also comes with homemade chips but no bread). Surprisingly really good as well!!!! I liked this better than my lobster omelet. $10",

Ingredients also included turkey, guacamole and Jack cheese. I thought it could have been seasoned better, but I wonder if this is on purpose: catering to an elderly crowd perhaps. On the side was some freshly fried potato chips and moist banana bread. Overall, I was satisfied with the food.  AMBIANCE A local breakfast spot, and certainly seemed popular. The interior felt cramped in some aisles. The decor was primarily decked in wood, as well as the walls, booths and tables. It really feels like an old-fashioned diner from a long time ago.  SERVICE Most of the waiting staff was pleasant enough. Managed to get a refill for my soda. The main reason for the rating was this: after just eating half of the omelet, and as we were preparing to pay the check, our grandmotherly waitress cleared the table... At first I thought she was going to take it back to box it to go... Nope. And it wasn't just my order that was thrown out. My girlfriend's dish as well. Oddly enough, she didn't take away the banana bread.  There are men and women's restrooms.  I would have been more favorable with my review, but not being able to take the majority of the food I paid for, left me on a sour note. If you do come here, be sure to watch your food.",

First, you have to know that we were staying at the Golden Nugget, and we needed to get out of the constant thump, thump, thump that has become the staple of the casinos.  We needed calm, we needed organized, we needed the feeling of home, and boy did this place deliver.  Your town probably has one of these places.  It offers everything, but, as this was our first visit, we only got to try two things.  My wife had an egg white veggie omelet that arrived with a side of potato chips.  The chips had been freshly cut, cooked and seasoned.  She ate a few and I ate a few.  It was all good.  Her dish also came with pumpkin break, which she enjoyed.  I had the pancake, egg, and bacon breakfast.  It was good.  So, if you're downtown at one of the casinos, need some space, some calm, some 'down-home', this is a great option, and it's only about five minutes away.",

As everyone else has said; the banana bread & pumpkin bread are great! served both moist and warm. The potatoes are more like thick cut potato chips (but that isn't a complaint!!).  They've always managed to keep my coffee cup & water glass full.  It's a maze of rooms and filled nick-nacks. Look around at all the kitsch, you'll find something from your childhood. The hidden large back room is great for groups and children (I've seen balloon animal makers here, late mornings, on weekends). A side booth area for more of a coffee shop feel, and a main room that feels like tables have been set up in grandmas dining room.  I've seen local \"celebrities\" eating here & sometimes there's a short wait (when the after church crowd hits).",

    "text": "Food's OK, not worth dealing with management though. Always thinking about the next customer instead of the current ones. Specifically the male manager with grey hair wearing a purple shirt and khaki shorts.  Thanks for the reply, guy.  Apparently you didn't notice the other tables around us who walked out not appreciating having received the same kind of service. Guess they weren't \"honest\" enough either.  The woman who attended our table was actually nice and playful and she was as concerned about getting the rest of the party there, but she wasn't rude about it and getting in our faces in the same manner. That's another thing you should learn to respect: personal space. It's not nice to lean waaay over the table not really saying anything, making faces, and just kind of sweating over our plates. And unless you had your timer on and were on it, I'd be hard pressed to say it was an hour wait. And it wasn't like the present party wasn't ordering drinks, appetizers and entrees in the meantime.  I noticed that you only respond to negative reviews where you think you have the upper hand and can get the last word in. I hope that continues to go well for you and I hope you can maintain your friendly staff to cover up for your managerial (if you are in fact, a manager) ineptidude.",

    "text": "LOVE THIS PLACE! My family and I came here on a whim, they wanted to go to IHOP, I thought that was a lame idea, so I yelped breakfast and found this place. I've been here at least 5-6 times now and every time it is amazing and consistent. I've NEVER needed a reservation, and they are ALWAYS super busy, even late in the afternoon on a weekday.  There are over 40 variations of omelets, and each omelet comes with a choice of bread, and a pile of sliced & fried potatoes. While there is a choice of bread, the only REAL choice is the banana nut bread. A square of it comes to you before your meal, hot with a side of butter to smother on it. My favorite omelet is The Californian, it comes with sausage, avocado and jack cheese.  BE WARNED, come extra HUNGRY, the omelets are a whopping 6 egg omelet, and I believe the average omelet is 9.99. If you have people to share with, order the fried zucchini which is on the lunch menu. You have the option of a 1/2 order or full order, both sizable orders. They have the choice of ranch or cheese dipping sauce, I always get both.  : ) You have the option of getting a smaller 3 egg omelet, but it is only .89 cheaper, so I say it just makes sense to get the regular one and do as much damage as you can.  The service is always great, some of the older waitress' seem like they're going to be rude, simply because they sometimes don't smile often, but they are always attentive and get your orders right and out quick. Again, this place is always busy, but the staff helps each other out, making the experience great, and turn around time efficient. I've brought my family here, including super picky younger brother and sister, and my in-laws, and everyone has loved it here. My in-laws loved the coffee FYI. My husband and I will continue to come here for as long as we live in Las Vegas, Thank you Omelet House!!",

    "text": "They say the omelets are large here and they sure as hell aren't exaggerating. I came here with a large party and several of us were determined to finish their omelettes in one sitting. I was not among that company. Just getting through 2/3 of this monstrosity took an absurd amount of effort.   I went with the cowboy, which is basically beef chilli and cheese in an already enormous (must be at least 4  or more eggs) contraption. The chilli is tasty- I had no problem wolfing it down. Bit of advice-- If you are feeling a bit of health guilt and opt for the wheat toast as I did, make sure to ask for it UNBUTTERED or else you will be treated to two gelatinous slabs of what used to be a healthy side dish. I can't say I was impressed with the fried potatotes-- they were extremely greasy and soft. In other words, not appetizing at all. Our party ordered some fried zucchini as well which came with some tasty ranch, and some not so appealing nacho cheese like substance.  Our waitress was pretty friendly however, and I thought the coffee wasn't bad. And in terms of restaurants in vegas, this place is bordering on iconic-- it's a known landmark on Charleston and is often frequented by Old Vegas money. The selection is very impressive-- they basically have an omelette for every possible taste preference you can think of. If you're in the mood for a hearty dance with the devil to start off your day, this is your spot.",

We got fast service and the food came nice and hot, but my omelet which had cheddar cheese in it, had way too much cheese and someone had added chicken?   Since I was very specific about bacon, I was surprised to see the chicken. I think that perhaps my order was mixed up with someone Else's, or the server didn't hear me correctly.   It wasn't that bad, but it was a disappointment that I didn't get my bacon. Since my husband and I often watch our carbs, (we try to go pretty strict) we both got sliced tomato's instead of potatoes. I think they have pretty good potatoes and of course the pumpkin bread, which we did pass on this time, is always good.   This place is good for breakfast and I would recommend it to anyone who loves a good breakfast.",

    "text": "Went to try the omelette house for the first time as we were recommended this place by a friend. The decor is old fashioned and looked like your grandmas house. The menu had a quite extensive array of omelettes ( duh why would it be called the omelette house) but also offered sandwiches, pancakes, waffles, burgers, and more. These omelettes are really big so I would suggest you guys just order one and get it split (cost 95 cents) and they just added more potatoes (kind of a hybrid of a potato home fries and a chip). For the whole family we got the chicken fried steak, the famous fried zucchini half order, and the chili verde omelette. The omelette was almost like a chicken enchilada but replace the tortilla with eggs. It was good, filling, but couldn't eat to much of it. Seemed like they used half a dozen eggs to make the darn thing. Chicken fried steak was also good and again portions are so big you can share between two people unless you eat a whole lot. Kids got the waffles and hit chocolate and that was too much for two kids The zucchini was ok as I prefer large pieces of zucchini and they made theirs like zucchini fries. Never had it with cheese dip but was good. Service was great and overall would seem like a 4 Star deal but I just couldn't do it. Omelette lovers this would be the place for you!  Sorry almost forgot and had to come edit it but the banana bread was probably he best part of the meal as it was warm and tasted pretty good. Didn't much like the pumpkin...but I'm kinda biased too about banana bread because I am still floored by the ones I have had in Maui, HI and really haven't had any better",

Breakfast potatoes are deep fried and left to get cold and so unedible.  It costs me $30, which I don't mind paying for good food and generous portions.

Man were we happy we did all 4 of us in our group could not find something to complain about. Everything perfect. Now this is an Old School diner type place it's only open for breakfast and lunch and closes at 3pm so you know what they do is good. I ordered Chicken Fried Steak, hadn't had this in about 5 years, it was Fantastic. The steak nice and crispy the gravy had great flavor and tasted completely homemade. Now those potatoes I would go back just for those home fried potatoes. We all agreed the coffee was very good and for my wife to say coffee is good that's few and far between because she is a  Starbucks Addict. The waitress was very friendly and completely on top of our needs. If in Vegas you must give this place a try!",

Idk why the restaurant is laid out like this to where walking to your table you have to walk through the busser/server side station....very unorthodox.  We got sat and didn't get greeted for 17 minutes. I started timing it on my phone after 5. We had to grab another server who clearly wasn't supposed to be ours. She kind of saved this \"experience\"  I specified to my server I was vegetarian and didn't touch meat. Low and behold my omelet was full of sausage. Gross. I lost my appetite after that. The avocado on my omelet was turning. Either it was originally bad or it was in the expo window wayyyyyy too long.  Banana bread was probably the best part of the meal, sadly that's not a good thing.  I'm upset with the fact no manager came over after ALL OF THIS. Maybe the server should have told the manager it was going this bad. Nothing was done on the check for anything. Losing clientele isn't a good thing, especially locals.  Had really high hopes for this place and it fell flat on its face.",

When you go in, you'll see several figurines and trinkets on the wall, like in your grandma's house, as my boyfriend had put it. The hostess seated us right away and led us to our table in the back area to the right past the restrooms. I was surprised on how huge the restaurant was!  When we got seated, the hostess handed us menus that were huge also! It took me awhile to decide, but I knew I was getting banana bread as my friends had highly recommended. I ended up getting the Country Club with no tomatoes. And wow, it was delicious!! They are very generous in the content of the omelette and loved how cheesy it was. The chips it came with were so good too!! Also really big portion, so I didn't finish mine. Probably next time, I'll do the smaller portion or share with someone.  Food - 2/2 Atmosphere - 1/1 Customer service - 1/1 Price - 1/1 My Overall - 5/5",

Its like a fresh breath of grandma air when you come here..it's nice.   This OG spot has been in the biz since 1979 and for locals it's a cherished place. The charm of this place has to be its decor, Zagat says its 3.7 but no buddy it's 5. Every nook and cranny has some sort of Vegas history and/or vintage Knick knack. The family that operate this place are wonderful people that are often here helping out. The staff here are just kick ass, we always request to sit at the booth.. it's just tradition for us and they always try to accommodate us. Shirley is a sever there she is so witty and funny and Amanda is just the sweetest take care of them!!  The food is huge. Specifically the omelettes my man always orders the carnitas omelette, my go to usually is the lobster benedict also huge but the hollandaise and bites of lobster are so good you can't stop eating. Zucchini sticks are a must with the ranch & cheese sauces (((drools))) The coffee is also good, unlimited cups of joy. Most entrees include bread (banana, pumpkin or toast) and hella  chips of potato.  The only con is waiting, wait times here are no joke on weekends and holidays especially so be aware. During the week days isn't bad so I'd try to come than.   This isn't a chic glam brunch, and I'm so glad it isn't. You can put your phone down, enjoy your company and good food.",

    "text": "Our cousin who lives in Las Vegas gave this his thumbs up when we were searching for a place for about 20 family members to get together for breakfast the day after a wedding.  I was scouting breakfast places for groups on Yelp and asking the cousin if he'd heard of any of them / been to any of them.  His ears perked up when I mentioned Omelet House.  He reported that it was a locals' favorite.  He took care of making a reservation for the group.  As we started to gather, those of us that were there early were sitting in the front hallway, watching lots of folks come in and get seated.  It was about 11:45 AM on a Friday morning.  The place was getting busy.  From the front you'd have no idea how large this place is - there are rooms beyond rooms beyond rooms to the inner sanctum.  The decor is very comfy cozy 70's kitschy.  Just go with it.  There's lots to look at, for sure!  Once enough of our group arrived to be seated, they led us through the maze of rooms to one large inner space.  We were about 22 by that point, and we weren't the only ones in the room.    Two servers were assigned to take care of our long extended table.  They were well-seasoned professionals and took great care of us.  Coffee refills flowed, and the order was gathered efficiently.  Often coffee shop java is just so-so.  Theirs was hot, fresh, smooth, and flavorful.  Great quantities of comfort food came forth from the kitchen in short order.  Though everyone in the family seemed to talking all at once, there was a lot of pausing to enjoy the yummy meals.  There were lots of smiles around the table and comments about how enjoyable the experience was for everyone.  If you're ready to go back into a time capsule of good eats and homey decor, this is a place for you.  Free parking / away from the crowds on the Strip or Downtown, with very fair prices and extremely large portions - it's all that!",

Anywho (how about this one?), there's pictures of famous people who have dined here and items in a curio that's available for purchase. I fought the urge to buy something, good job me!   We ordered:   Chicken fried steak and eggs- you guys know this all I order if it's available and this has been the best I've ever had. My kids agree, they too order this all the time that my husband just rolls his eyes when we eat out.   Huevos rancheros- with hot sauce, my husband devoured his breakfast.

I've never had an omelet so fluffy and the ratio of the ingredients inside was fantastic. The omelet was served with the most incredible homemade chips and the moistest, delicious, amazing banana bread ever. Wish I could rate more than 5 stars",

Their lobster omelette had the biggest chunks of lobster with cheese and eggs. The chef definitely didn't skimp on this one! What I love is that although they give you big portions, they also have an option to get a smaller size and 1$ off! Their potatoes are to DIE FOR. Cut thin some are crispy and others are softer, they have their potatoes attuned towards all potato lovers, crispy and mushy alike! Service was ok, but the food was where it was at. Also know that Clinton dined here, so you gotta know it's good! You'll LOB(ster) it!!!! I know I did. We'll be back the next time we're in Vegas!",

    "text": "Omelet House rocks! Over 30 different and unique varieties on the menu, all with clever names, a gut-busting size, and crazy-low prices! Even the varieties with fancy fillings like asparagus and lobster are still around $11, and the sheer size makes them more than shareable. The three below are ones I remember but I always try something different.  THE SPARTACUS: Asparagus, mushrooms, and cheddar, with cheese sauce on the side. You wouldn't think to combine a classy veggie like asparagus with gas station nacho cheese, but it works! Even without a protein this packs a punch, if you can eat the whole thing, it'll fill you up all day. CHILI VERDE OMELET: pork, green chile sauce, and jack cheese. It's just slightly spicy, super meaty, and full of flavor. The green sauce is done well here, and you can add on various hot sauces at the table if you need extra heat. LIBERTY BELL: Basically a Philly cheese steak but with a blanket of eggs instead of a roll. No whiz or provolone, topped with melted Jack instead. Somehow it works, definitely on the heavier side but the meat is really juicy.   Omelets come with a bread choice and \"Rip Taylor's favorite spuds\", which are house-made potato chips, and they're pretty decent. Good mix of soggy and crisp potato slices to pick out the kind you prefer, but I wish they were seasoned better. Of your bread options, the Pumpkin Nut Bread is off the chain. Get it. Special shout out to the fried zucchini app, get it if you have a group to share with.  Service is usually pretty attentive, the whole staff hustles to flip tables and help each other out. Interior is bigger than the exterior suggests, and it's decorated country-style with homey knick-knacks and antique furniture,  back room can be reserved for especially large parties.",

Had the split order of the \"kitchen sink\" omelette. Split order is an extra $1, and they give you extra \"spuds\" / potato chips. It came in two different plates. I would say, this combo is not for the faint of heart and the health conscious. This omelette was jammed/packed with all kinds of meats such as ham, sausage, bacon, plus chilli, cheese, onions, green peppers and a couple other things that I ate way too fast. The spud were surprisingly a really good side item with the perfect crunch.   Banana nut bread didnt disappoint. It's slightly sweet and savory. It comes with whipped veggie oil if you want to add a dash of saltiness. To me, the bread was good as it was. Nothing else was needed. It came moist and warm and I'm all for it!  Also tried the \"fresh up\" - which is a lot of orange and Sprite with a dash of nutmeg. At $3.20, I'm not that impressed. so, meh for me.   All in all, I'm glad I saw this in the episode of jerry seinfeld's Comedians in cars getting coffee. Otherwise. I wouldve not know of this place that is a few miles off the strip.  I highly recommend for an interesting breakfast experience.",

Today's excursion was to find a place for breakfast and this place has good ratings.  Wandering in, i was pleased to see their food met my 2 criteria of delicious & lots.   These servings are large enough to be shared by two people!  I had their 38 special which has ham, sausage and bacon in the omelette.  It was great!  I couldn't finish it all.

    "text": "5 years ago... when my boyfriend and I took our first trip to Vegas together, we stumbled onto a little hole in the wall with some of the BIGGEST omlets ever!  They have almost ANY omlet you can imagine. He opts for the chicken, broccoli and cheese. Weird combo for an omlet, but super delicious. I went for the lobster omlet with avocado and cheese. Simple, but the chunks of lobster make it so savory and its gravy-free !! (Sidebar: I always wondered why most places feel compelled to smother their seafood omlets with gravy that reminds me of thickened clam chowder - yuck!)  All of the omlets are served with their version of home fried potatoes which resemble more like chips. They are also served with a bread of choice with your every day run of the mill options like white, wheat, english muffin and sour dough; but they also offer pumpkin and banana bread. I recommend the banana bread but the pumpkin is great as well. Those last 2 options come out like an appetizer... warmed with butter on the side. So delicious. We opted for one of each, but both fell for the banana bread even though the pumpkin was delicious as well.  Think what I love most about this place is in the 5 years between our last visit and this one is that the service ALWAYS comes with a smile. Even with organized confusion - this place gets SUPER busy at times - the hostesses and waitors/tresses appear to be happy to be there and happy to help with anything you may need.   After this trip, we will definitely make this the last stop on the way home with every Vegas trip. Hope they never change...",

I waited in line in what seemed like a forever wait but wasn't bad maybe 15-20 minutes. My Dad said I use to bring you here as a little girl but that was forever ago so I couldn't remember the food. My Dad mentioned he'd been here about a year ago. Not sure why I didn't get an invite but okay. So we sit down waitress came over we ordered drinks she was super nice! The menu is massive made it very hard stick with a choice. Everything sounded amazing! My girls order the normal that you can find anywhere pancakes, French toast, eggs and bacon. My Dad and stepmom ordered the meat lovers omelette and I had \"The California Omelette \" avocado, sausage and cheese. My Dad and I have toast and my stepmom had banana bread. The food comes out and the portions are insane! Loved the spuds neat twist on breakfast potatoes salty but yummy if you can deal with the salt. The omelette was okay I hate to say this but there was so much sausage it was too much. I never made it to even half of the omelette. The sourdough toast wasn't good which I really can't put my finger on it. When I asked my Dad he agreed. As we took out food to go the omelette opened up and there was all the avocado I was hoping for in the middle oh well. Not saying I will never go back but I won't rush back. I almost feel like I owe my family a brunch.",

    "text": "Hi.  I grew up in Las Vegas and have eaten breakfast at the Omelet House many times.  My experiences have always been decent which is why I am completely disheartened by my family's last experience with the Omelet House.  Yesterday, my husband and our two children, ages 8 and 4, were running errands and decided to have breakfast there.  My husband had been fasting for blood work.  The facility was across the street and as anyone who has ever had to maneuver around Charleston and Rancho knows, it is quite difficult to get around due the no u-turn lanes and multiple lanes of traffic.  My family parked at the Omelet House and walked across the street at 9:50am.  He signed in at the blood place at 9:57am.  He returned at almost 10:25am ready to eat food and noticed that his car was missing.  The Omelet House had him towed.  Now I understand the need for ample customer parking on busy days, like weekend brunch, but it was Monday and there were many open parking spaces.  The gentleman and I use that term loosely, claimed that he waited 30 minutes to call the tow truck, but tow records show that they called at 9:52.  As my now stranded husband was trying to figure out what to do, The Omelet House staff read to him from a piece of paper something that ended in him needed to leave the premises with threat of arrest.  Did I mention he had two small children with him?  When did we stop treating people like people?  How would parking in the lot been any benefit to my family unless they were planning to eat at the Omelet House?  Well, if the purpose of the parking policy is to keep people from parking there, it worked.  I know of at least 4 people that will never park in the parking lot again.  Good job Omelet House!",

All was not lost though as the side of fresh potatoes chips was decent. Just had to dab it a few times with a napkin to get rid of the grease. If you're needing volume to refuel in the morning this is your place...but if you're more into tasty meals look elsewhere.",

First time I ordered the comp banana bread and The Californian omelet (jack cheese, sausage, and avocado) - truly the best omelet i've ever had. So delish! Two days later I ordered the comp pumpkin bread and got the same omelet: it was THAT good! Both comp bread are excellent but the pumpkin bread is my favorite - served warm with a pat of butter - heavenly!! Also served with the omelet is a huge pile of homemade potato crisps...but omelet was so large that had only a few crisps, which were slightly salted and quite good. Definitely recommend this place!!",

She made mistakes on my tables order and just had an old lady grouch to her demeanor. I didn't ask to change sections for a new server.

Even when it's expensive, quality is compromise but not this place. We have to walk in and right after us a line formed and apparently the owner was busy trying to find seating for everyone and his hospitality was wonderful. He truly cared about us and every person that came through the door waiting for a seat. After waiting only a few minutes we were quickly seated and our second \"wow\" factor happened. The food as far as quality, taste, portion size was on speakable!! Everything was just wonderful!! Way above our expectations. The waitress was quick and very pleasant. The overall hospitality was impeccable. I highly recommend this place for breakfast and lunch. The prices are great for what you get. We are from Arizona and were visiting. We definitely will be back to visit this restaurant!",

I had the homemade corn beef hash.  It was delicious - you have to try it.  Everyone at our table enjoyed the potatoes, which were like thicker chips.  It had the right balance of seasoning.  The eggs were made to order, and were not over or undercooked.  The pancakes were delicious.  The 2 types of breads they served were warm and very tasty.  Next time, I want to starve myself and come back to try the lobster omelet.  The person who ordered it said it was huge and tasted very good.  They give you a lot of food.

Which had everything. The taste was ok for me. Except they went all out on the beans. Part of our party enjoyed it and ordered it twice already.  It was like eating two omelletes. I tried their lobster benedict which is ok. The pumpkin bread was good. The mile high omellete I ordered was a little dry. Everyone elses food came out ok. The Belgian waffles are huge and so are their waffles. Most of their dishes come with spuds and we all enjoy them extra crispy. We ended up ordering an extra order coz it was that good. The only issue I have with them is that their drinks are overpriced. Regular coffee, tea, or soda is 2.75. Their pancakes have a hint of baking soda that we could tell. Overall the service is what makes them shine. They do take good care of you. It's that at home feel that makes this place a gem that we sometimes miss being around big business. I know they will stand the test of time since they have been here a long time. Whenever in Vegas this is one of our stops for breakfast.",

Of course, I opted for the chicken fried steak and was met with some resistance when trying to substitute a pancake for my choice of bread. The eggs were cold, I'm sure due in part to the cold draft coming through the door we were seated next to.   The chicken fried steak itself was pretty good. Tender with a flaky breading covered with country gravy. However, it was served on top of what is usually fresh and crisp potato chip like, fried potatoes. I had to move the CFS to it's own plate for proper consumption.   The service was slow at first, but once they got rolling, the coffee and water were never empty.  I would give the chicken fried steak nearly four stars, but the overall rating is only three stars this time around. I will be back.",

    "text": "I'm retired and met another retired former coworker for breakfast at one of our favorite restaurants, the Omelet House. I've lived in Las Vegas 44 years and this is my favorite breakfast/lunch house. You have to try the Bugsy Siegel omelet that has marinated melt in your mouth beef chunks in a delicious Italian sauce, sour cream, and cheese. Their banana nut bread or pumpkin bread are a great substitute for toast. They have the best potatoes and I've never seen anywhere else. They are very thin sliced, fried and seasoned to perfection. Their baby omelets are 3 egg rather than their standard 6 egg omelet and I guarantee it is plenty to satisfy anyone's hunger at a discounted price.",

They had a ton of knick-knacks and autographs from famous persons who have eaten there! President Clinton had eaten there! Their potatoes were amazing! Great for a hangover cure. They were fast, even while being packed. Definitely give this place a try, you will not regret it! Wish we had came back the following morning.",

It would take a lot for me to sacrifice an extra few hours of snoozing - this place is THAT special. I actually look forward to eating here...well, once every few months.  They have eggs benedict and a variety of omelets hence the name \"Omelet House\". Don't bother getting toast, make the right decision and pick the banana bread. It's delicious, warm, buttery and it's huge. It's like having dessert for breakfast - what a treat! My favorites are country club/ sparticus/ 38 special...in baby version which is still quite big (3 eggs). Your omelet will come with a side of potatoes. They're like thick freshly-made potato chips and oh-so good! You're off to a great morning and nothing can ruin your day.  Aside from omelets, they also have pancakes, waffles, sandwiches and burgers - I haven't tried them. With omelets served here, I don't need to try anything else. But I would imagine they're good too.",

And I think we stand out being European tourist because on several occasions we've had a nice conversation with the owner asking us how we found and like the place.  We'll: we love it! The atmosphere is like you're dining with your crazy aunt that can't stop collection teapots and hasn't change her decor in ages. But that's the fun of it.. You'll find not only teapots, but also cookie jars, muts, salt and peppers, etc. Really nice to look at. And don't forgot the big wall painting.  Service is very, very prompt. Portions are beyond huge. Spuds are to die for. Best we've ever had.  Have to be honoust: although we come here 4-6 times a year we always take an omelet. Most of the times my love orders a 38. meat lovers omelet and I always order some kind of egg white omelet with vegetables and feta. Both a big succes. So can't really tell you something about the dishes besides the 40 somewhat omelet choices. But hey, why go to an omelet house to have a salad?  And remember Intold you the portions are huge. Consider ordering a baby omelet.",

    "text": "Walking into this place is much like going back in time. It almost feels wrong using a cell phone inside.  It has a farmhouse type of feel--but not in a modernized, trying-to-hard-to-be-farmhouse-type of way. Like, you know it looked like that long before it was cool to look like that.   The omelets are incredibly well-priced. They were pretty much all $11 for a 6 egg omelet (only 50 cents more for egg whites), unless you wanted a 3 egg omelet--then it's $1 less.  I got the My Little Chick-a-Dee Omelet, which had white chicken breast, onion, broccoli, and cheddar cheese. It was pretty tasty. Not the strongest of flavors, but nice and light.  My fiancee got the Rio Grande Surfer, which included chorizo sausage and cheddar cheese. I'm usually not a big chorizo fan, but this was really good quality.   Each omelet comes with their house made potato chips, which have an oddly appealing anti-crunch to them. Absolutely addicting, but when are potato chips NOT addicting? Nonetheless, I loved the unique spin they put on them.  The honest truth is you can't beat this place price-wise. My favorite omelets are at the Peppermill across town, but those are still 4 dollars more than this place (albeit, tastier). But if you want to support a cool little piece of off-the-strip history, go to the Omelet House and you won't be disappointed. Plus, the staff is really homey and friendly.",

We had a great incredible waitress--Amanda, but I did notice that another woman that came to our table at the end of the meal to help out was a lot less friendly and sourpussed so I am glad that we were not stuck with her otherwise this may have been a very different review.  I had the egg white omelet, veggies, add chicken with the banana nut bread and potatoes.  The Omelet was a 6 on a 1 to 5 scale.   Off the scale!  It was approx. 14.00 before tip.  The included banana nut bread was a 4 of 5--excellent taste but unhealthy.  The potatoes were a 2 of 5--really could not eat too many they were so greasy and oily and tasted from oil. Yuk!  Would definitely return for the Omelet again and try to substitute the potatoes for something else.  Restroom Side note:  The men's restroom here was a nose holder.  It was dirty, urine smell, and you had to hold your nose and get out quickly.  They probably can't clean properly because the wall tiles and floor tiles look like splattered urine so you can't know if you cleaned it.  It's not like solid white where you know immediately if you missed a spot.   My partner was unable to use the woman's restroom it was so dirty.",

So I Yelped and  the Omlet House was the first to pop up on the radar that wasn't a new kid on the block.    If this were a truck stop the economy would seriously slow down to a crawl.

I have visited this restaurant twice in a year (I'm not local to Vegas), and there are only two restaurants that we visited each time where we used credit cards to pay, this being one of them - and each time we've visited our cards were skimmed, duplicated and the fraudulent charges started racking up.  We keep our cards in sleeves that protect from random skimming so they had to have been physically skimmed when we paid our bill.  As I said, it was either here OR the other place, I'm dropping this same warning on my review of the other restaurant.",

    "text": "Our first visit to the Omelet House and I am sure happy we went! We were in the mood for breakfast so Omelets we got as that is what they are famous for! I decided on the \"Mile High City\" which is basically a Denver Omelet, ham, onions and bell pepper and it was delicious. The side I ordered that came with my meal was the fresh baked walnut banana cake, mmmm so hot and flavorful! I like that they have other choices than the typical option for toast.  My boyfriend got the \"Bugsy Siegel\" which was very tasty, generous chunks of moist roast beef, Italian red sauce, sour cream and jack cheese! The Omelets are huge to say the least, I think the Server said 7 eggs? I took a bite of his Omelet not really sure if I would like that combination however it blew my mind it was so damn good!  The portions are generous, the prices reasonable for what you get! They even have a coupon in the Entertainment book for $7.00 off. We love to eat out and save money so that was a nice added bonus, I am just shocked they have a discount coupon with how big their portions are! It did the job it got us to try a new breakfast place that really delighted our taste buds! We will be back for sure!  My only dislike is that they pair their Omelets with homemade thin potato chips instead of hashed browns or Country style potatoes. The homemade chips I might like better paired with a sandwich for lunch rather than a breakfast omelet. That was just the opinion of my boyfriend and I. We will ask next time if there is a substitution option available instead of the chips.   The service is Amazing, good old fashioned kindness at this restaurant and is very comfortable as it has a Country thrift store theme with all of the decorations on the walls.",

You can tell as soon as you walk in its an older restaurant.  We ordered the country club omelette and the lobster benedict. Both were very satisfying. Looking at the pictures i wasn't excited about the potatoes...until i tried one...soooo good!! Prices weren't bad. Most omelets were $10.49 for the small omelette which has 3 whole eggs in it and ended up being a large portion. The large has 6 eggs.  There is a $1.49 charge to substitute egg whites.   Overall great experience...good food...friendly staff...We'll be back and would definitely recommend having breakfast here.",

Our food took a little time to come out, but I've learned that means that they are probably actually cooking it (as I typed this our food came lol).

This time was no different.    Food: we started out with some of their Zuchinni Sticks, because they are so good. We got half an order, which was plenty for 3 of us.     They ordered omelettes, but I went to an old safety...their homemade Hash and eggs. It is so good!!!   There are big chunks of corned beef and fried with potatoes. It comes with two eggs, their delicious breakfast hash browns, which are more like yummy chips, and your choice of bread. And here's the best part...besides the normal toast, muffin choices, they have homemade Pumpkin or Banana Bread.   Since I got my eggs over easy, I needed toast to sop it up, so I always order some Banana Bread in the side Togo.     The portions are huge, so there will be a Togo box, unless you downsize to half omelettes.   Service: the service is typical of a very busy breakfast place.  Not rude or slow, but not friendly or fast. But the food is good, so I don't care.   Facility:  this is a divey kinda place, but with an eclectic flare.  They have memorabilia from all things Vegas and old school. A lot of the items are for sale too.   Overall review: probably my fav breakfast place. Their food has never disappointed, so I will definitely be back!!!",

    "text": "What a hidden gem for breakfast! :) I came here with my mom after errands were done and the food is quite pleasing to the taste buds! We started with the Pumpkin Nut Bread......AMAZING! I don't usually say that about most places but this place....thumbs up. The bread was fluffy, warm and had just the right amount of walnuts. So that was a plus! My mom had a egg sandwich I believe which came with these thinly potato sliced potato chips. She raved about how good her sandwich was and you get a generous amount of portions of each! I wasn't extremely hungry so I stuck to the oatmeal with bananas and strawberries. I know it seems so simple but this was also quite delicious! Normally when I get oatmeal it's incredibly dry....thank goodness for this place! It was absolutely delicious and again you get a generous portion.   Service: Our server and service was okay in the beginning we were greeted with a different server who was peppy, but she politely asked the other server if that was her table. We wanted the other girl back. Other than that everyone worked well together and I was surely surprised about how packed it was! Coming back to try those omlettes for sure :)",

    "text": "I could condense my review into four simple words, to be honest -  Get. The. Pumpkin. Bread.  I'm ashamed to say that I can't even remember what I'd had here.  (The pictures tell me chicken fried steak and eggs.  Not bad, now that I remember.  Pretty good, actually.)  The fries stood out because they were sort of almost like potato chips (not necessarily a bad thing) - but otherwise, it was decent, good breakfast food with nothing else that was truly a standout.  Except for that pumpkin bread.  Oh...em... effing.... GEE.  That pumpkin bread was hot, steaming, with butter slathered on the top... I can't even use any word in the English language to describe the utter deliciousness.  If I'd had my choice, I could have simply eaten that alone for breakfast and I would have been just fine with that.  Completely fine with that.    My husband had the banana nut bread and he said that it was just as good as the pumpkin - maybe even better.  When we come back here, I'll make sure to find out and report back, heh.  If you get Julie as your server, you'll be completely and totally happy.  She was the sweetest lady with a heart of gold.  Totally deserved that extra tip we laid down.    The decor was very countrified, paneled walls, dark and \"homey\".  No complaints here - I thought it was charming and suited the place very well.  No wait, but we came sort of late in the day (after 11:00am).  One star off, though, for the coffee.  The coffee was... in a word... abominable.  But that pumpkin bread completely makes up for it.    I think that we could have been served warm cat excrement and had a server straight out of Dick's Last Resort on the Strip and it wouldn't have mattered, as long as I could have that pumpkin bread.  Did I mention the pumpkin bread was AWESOME?  Oh, I did, then.    Not a bad spot to stop in for breakfast.  It's not the absolute #1 choice (you want Mr. Mama's or Kailyn's Kitchen for that)... but it's worthy.  Especially for that....oh, well, you know.  :)",

When you pair it up with the homemade potato chips it's absolutely the best hangover food. You have to get there before 11 am or else you will be waiting for a while. Something that is a must get is the banana nut bread or the pumpkin bread. Both freshly baked everyday.   Their waffle special is also good for $9.00. If you go to iHop or Denny's the quality won't be the same. The omelets are huge. 6 eggs?!? That's bananas. You can get a 3 egg omelet for 89 cents off.   The decor looks like the inside of your grandmothers house. Plenty of vintage salt and pepper shakers and dusty silk flowers.",

The exterior sign in the front is a little deceiving, we almost left because we thought the building in the front of the shopping center was the Omelette House, and im so glad we found this little gem..  It was pretty busy for 10am on a friday, but we were seated immediately and asked what we wanted to drink as I was seating down. \"Great!\". I went to the restroom and its a little dated and dark but still clean. I cane back to the table and drinks were already here.   My boyfriend got the lobster omelette and I ordered the lobster benedict. The Benedict came with bread; the server gave me three options: pumpkin, banana and regular toast. I chose pumpkin and OHHHMGG, VERY SOLID CHOICE. It was so hot and you need to use the butter on it.   The food came out shortly after, very very quick food. And the Benedict was to die for because \"that is the best benedict ive ever had!\" Me and my boyfriend split food whenever we go out, I didnt even get to taste my boyfriends omelette because I was too full after the bread and my half of the Benedict. They do charge for plate splitting though so make sure you just split it yourselves. Our server was nice and told us beforehand.   They even checked my id for my credit card but they dont take discover or american express.   Overall, win. Im so glad we came here.",

    "text": "The two star rating was not for the food because my boyfriend enjoyed his lobster omelet, and my french toast stuffed with blueberry jam was delicious, but rather, it was for the dismissive customer service.  We arrived on a non-busy Wednesday morning. This is a local's joint, but I'm not sure if that had anything to do with the absence in customer service that morning.  It was odd that when my boyfriend and I were seated, the waitress NEVER returned to our table to take our orders. I forgot her name otherwise it would've been mentioned on here. She had passed us a few times, and I think she had forgotten about us. There was one occasion where she even asked us how we were doing, but she still managed to not take our orders. I'm not sure if this was an off-day for her, but the restaurant was not busy. It was strange, and it left me feeling uncomfortable.  I finally had the nerve to flag down another waitress and informed her that we were ready to order. She rudely communicated this to our waitress, and finally she came over and jotted down our orders. She apologized, but it was an empty apology, but I gave her the benefit of the doubt nonetheless.  Our dishes were delicious, don't get me wrong. The coffee could've been more bold because it was very light and watery. I'm picky with my coffee (I grind my own beans at home) and was left disappointed that the coffee didn't give me an extra kick.  Anywho, I still tipped the waitress generously, but I hope that she learns her lesson to be more attentive.",

We order it as an appetizer while we wait for our meal. - My husband always gets an omelet. Today he actually got the \"baby\" version bc the standard is so large. We came in on a motorcycle so we couldn't take leftovers. - The mushroom burger is soooo yummy. Yes, on vacation, it is perfectly OK for a grown woman to eat a burger for breakfast. Don't judge.  Even when there's a line, we've never waited more than a couple minutes. There's plenty of seating, the servers are attentive and the food comes out quickly so it keeps everything moving.

It was excellent. The potatoes were homemade crispy chips. The sausage, biscuit, and eggs complemented one another. I am glad that I had the gravy on the side so that I could adjust the amount. I used some of the gravy as a dip for the potatoes. I recommend this restaurant for breakfast/brunch.",

    "text": "This old establishment is the typical coffee shop.  I had the Chicken Fried Steak.  I thought it was a pan fried variety, but the server told me it was deep fried.  The steak was breaded lightly and the breading was peeling off the steak.  This is typcial of pan fried, but not typical of deep fried.  This means their breading technique isn't good enough to keep the breading on the steak during the deep fry.  The steak was average.  The gravy had a lot of bits of ground sausage, so that was a plus.  More sausage than other places I tried here in Vegas. The Biscuit was small in comparison to other biscuits, but I can tell it's homemade by the flacky texture.  It was a very good biscuit.  The potatoes are thick potato chips.  Different, but burdensome.  Not used to having to use a knife with breakfast potatoes.",

I ordered the American Cheeseburger ( i know i ordered a cheeseburger in a breakfast joint ) but I was still thinking its a family owned diner it should be good. BIG Mistake..it was hands down the worst cheeseburger I have had in my life! The meat tasted like it was old and from one of those tubes that you buy for 2 bucks at the store. It was burned on the outside and pink in the middle, over worked dry and tough, the bun was wet from the wilted veggies. It actually made me sick ( i only are 2 bites )The atmosphere is unclean and it smells like dirty grandmas. I dont know how it got so many rave reviews... I guess people have no taste buds! And to top it off it was 35 dollars ( with my daughters 1 pancake included ). Stay away unless you like being sick and paying for it.",

With many strong reviews and a good history now of fellow yelpers not leading me astray I went for this breakfast joint. to self: Good call, you did well. There was a fast moving line out the door and it was evident this was where the locals get their breakfast grub on. This ain't their first rodeo here, they know how to seat you and get good food out fast. Wow, what great service they have. Nice friendly greeting and we were sat down promptly. Coffee cups were quickly brought out and filled and bottoms of cup never seen again. Hot and good coffee too! I had the chicken fried steak with eggs and my wife had the eggs benedict. Both were spot on. Could not have been happier with our decision to have breakfast here. Thanks again yelp and thanks omlett house. This is a very well run place. Will be back next time in Vegas and need arises to follow late night on Freemont Street with solid breakfast.",

    "text": "Overall:  Found this restaurant off of Yelp so decided to check it out. It's a family owned business serving typical diner style breakfast. Go here if you want hearty breakfast with great portions for the price, but be prepared to feel stuffed and a bit overwhelmed.   Ambiance/Location:  In the back of a strip mall, also a bit difficult to find (when you turn in, look on the back left of the parking lot). The inside is cute, with various curios on the walls and old pictures of famous people and their Best of Las Vegas articles (they won several years in the early 90's).   Food:  portions are HUGE (each omelet is made with 6 eggs, 4 if you downsize to the \"baby\" size). We ordered the \"kitchen sink\" which literally has everything in it from stew meat chunks and chili to bell peppers and onions. The lobster fest is filled with lobster, avocado, and cheese. Both tasted good, but were a bit overwhelming and heavy. (ie. if you are on any type of diet, you probably don't want to be here). Omelets are accompanied by potatoes cut like thick chips and deep fried, as well as a side of pumpkin bread, banana bread, toast, or English muffin. I highly recommend the pumpkin or banana bread which were hot, moist, hearty, and well-spiced. The pancakes were also pretty light and a bit more cake-y than others I've had. the syrup was thin and very sweet, not very flavorful.   Service:  friendly wait staff -- they recommended that we split an omelet between 2 people and were right (we didn't even finish)!   Price:  $9-11 per omelet, they didn't charge us the slit-plate fee of $0.95 so it is a great deal if you share.  $5.40 for 3 pancakes.",

I have a decent menu pic so zoom in to scope out the gazillion options.  Foods. Basic. Nothing fancy nothing crappy some chiles or hot sauce cant fix. The portions are epic. This make any fatty happy v(^^)v  I only got ommletes here. The liberty aka philly cheeseteak ommie was delish. Not too saturated with beef with plenty of shrooms and peppers.  The sad part is no hash browns. I dont know what its officially called but they give u potato chips. Super salty and oily. I didnt touch em.   The homemade breads, banana or pumpkin is a must. Do not get standard wheat or sourdough. These homemade puppies are badass. I think the pumpkin bread tasted better. They are nice, fresh and hot out the oven (or microwave). Check the pics, im pretty sure i took a shot of the steam but there was poor lighting even with flash so dont quote me on it.  Blueberry pancakes were ehhhh. Very little blueberries considering the flapjack appeared to boast a 10\" diameter. For you dummies, that just means its a big ole pancake like texas sized chicks :P  Sarcasm aside, the service was top notch. Everyone was polite, it seemed like all the staff is from the South cause thats what i got. Contrary to fake news cnn, the south (think alabama or trump voters regions) have amazing hospitality. Southern hospitality is no joke!  Price. Cheap for the overall package.  Im glad to find more of these gems in viva cause the whole casino foods and buffet got old and nastaaaay.",

    "text": "Omelet House is a great find off the Vegas Strip for a hearty American breakfast!  We came here on a lightly drizzling Sunday morning and the restaurant was jam packed! After being warned that the wait was an hour, and it was, we finally made it in. The restaurant was very organized with someone always keeping track of the line and making sure that the smaller tables go to the smaller party and the larger tables are saved for the larger party.   All of the omelettes were excellent. They must have used at least 4-5 eggs because each portion was more than sufficient. They come with potatoes that were like crunchy like potato chips but some were thick enough to be soft and greasy and delicious!   They also come with a side of your choosing: toast, English muffin, homemade pumpkin nut bread, banana nut bread, or tortilla. I highly recommend the pumpkin nut bread and banana nut bread! They come out still warm and are super fresh and scrumptious!   Here are some of the omelettes we tried: - \"The Californian\" - sausage, avocado and jack cheese - how can you go wrong? Yes, yes... I am actually from California. This was designed for people like me.  - Rio Grande Surfer - this one had spicy Mexican sausage that went really well with flour tortillas.   The \"Famous Friend Zucchini\" is also really good but GREASY. I highly recommend it but make sure you have the stomach for it. We only got 1/2 portion to share among 6 people and I think that was sufficient for all of us to get a bite and enjoy it. Any more than that and I think our stomach would have a hard time handling it.   For 6 people, the bill came out to be less than $10 per person (keep in mind some of us only order salad and soup). For the amount of food we received, this was valued packed! Sure the plates did not come out in fancy decoration as one would expect from restaurants on the Strip, but this was as good as it gets at an all American diner.   Note:  *$0.95 charge for splitting plates *omelette in smaller portions for $1 off. *parties of 8+ get a 15% gratuity add on.  The parking was a bit tough given how crowded it was. I overheard some people saying to each other that they were going to go to another branch. There are 3 locations listed on the menu but since I'm not local, I have no idea how close they are from each other.  Omelet House is an amazing American diner off Las Vegas Strip that is value packed and affordable!",

I have been many places that provide a good and hearty meal but the Omelette House is by far an experience you have to make time for when in Las Vegas. I was fortunate to have tried the Kitchen Sink and let me tell you it is no slouch, you better come with an appetite as this Goliath of an Omelette packs 6 eggs and just about everything know to have even been served on a breakfast plate. But do not be discouraged this Omelette is delicious and savory to a new level, every bite is a new explosion of flavors that truly delight any pallet. The service is awesome and very friendly and the atmosphere is very homey.",

The cowboy looked really good on paper, but but a little heavy, as I wasn't suffering a hangover I thought it better to save that for another day.   The service is awesome, the servers are all supper freindly and the food is quick. The ambiance and the service are the complete package and it feels like step back in time. Come hungery, it's a huge amount of food. I don't think anyone finished their plates at our table, I skipped lunch after that.",

Constant checking on us and refilling my coffee :)  My hubby ordered an omelet and I ordered the corned beef hash.  Based on other Yelp reviews I ordered my potatoes extra crispy.  They are honestly more like homemade chips than hash browns or fried potatoes.  While not my favorite, they were good.  I got the banana bread instead of toast and it was warm and delicious.  The corned beef hash was made with 90% shredded corned beef and 10% potatoes and was crisped up on both sides...delicious...one of the best I've had.  My hubby enjoyed his omelet but could only eat half since it was freaking huge.  Would definitely go back on our next trip to LV",

Our server was on top of her game and she could tell by the look of our faces that we were newbies in this establishment She gave us time to look, and was ready to take our orders.   Me, knowing the food and beverage industry - I could tell our server was busy, but still managed to hit our table. Also, I could see the manager was trying to hit every table as well. I wish I could remember our server's name, she was pretty awesome, pretty, blonde, and on top of her game. She definitely received more than 20% from me.   Now to the food part, my boyfriend ordered a side of banana nut bread - and let me tell you, it came out fresh, warm, and tasted home made! The portion sizes of the breakfast were good. I ordered the waffle special, and the waffle tasted good even without syrup. My boyfriend ordered the corn beef hash breakfast and I was surprised to see potato like chips. The chips were different sizes, some thick and moist, others were crunchy. I kept grabbing at his plate for it. I have never been to a cafe that served this. His mom ordered stuffed french toast, and she was happy with it.  I'd like to come back, hopefully I will have the same great service. :-)",

It was not just my family he was rude to, it was everyone (my heartfelt sympathy goes out to his employees. It must be embarrassing to work for someone like that). As a business owner myself for many years in Las Vegas, I can assure you that if I treated my customers that way I would be out of business! Personally, I will never step foot in his restaurants again. The owner might want to step down as host and hire someone with some tact to take his place.",

I chowed down on a green chili omlet (i can't remember the specific name) and it was awesome. Omlet filled with large chunks of pork and a tasty green chili blend and cheese. Delicious! The pumpkin bread was also amazing. Don't think Starbucks pumpkin bread. This is a mini loaf of pumpkin bread made with walnuts and raisins(?). Fantastic. Amazing. Yummy.

The pumpkin bread was as big as a piece of cake!  It came out warm with butter.  It was wonderful!  I ordered the #36, omelet with pork green chili.  I ordered the \"baby omelet\" which was supposed to be a smaller sized omelet...if this is small then the regular must be super sized!  Son got the pancakes with bacon and eggs.  Needless to say he cleaned his plate!  The menu is huge and doesn't disappoint, and the service was great!",

    "text": "Do not waste your time looking at any other breakfast spot.....this is where you'll want to eat. If I had my last meal at The Omelet House, I would die full and happy.  I can easily be described as a food snob. I care about presentation, service, taste, quality of ingredients.... I want it all. I'll pay a high price for great food. Fortunately, that wasn't necessary, here. The portions were enormous, the quality was impeccable, service was on-point, and the price was completely fair.  There were 3 of us, so we ordered a variety and shared. Pancakes.... I never order these. They're just flat cake...why waste the calories? Psh, I'll tell you why... Bc the pancakes at this place are perfectly cooked with a slightly crisp exterior and soft, fluffy inside. I'm better for having eaten them. Corned beef hash....we ordered the side dish. Holy cow.... It was a heaping portion of homemade hash with both small and large pieces of corned beef that they obviously roasted. Hands down the best corned beef hash I've ever had. Turkey Benedict....they obviously roast and slice their own bird. Thick, moist, fresh turkey slices with a sliced roasted tomato, avocado, and homemade hollandaise. The traditional Eggs Benedict doesn't hold a candle to this gem. I think my eyes rolled back in my head after the first bite. Side of potatoes.... These looked like chips. Nope! They are thicker and have a more meaty, potato center. Crisp edges with a perfectly soft center. Whatever they put on these sealed the deal for them bring the best potatoes for breakfast imaginable. Oatmeal.... Call me crazy, but I order oatmeal, often. I love to top my oatmeal with sliced banana, salt, bacon pieces and cream. As the base, the oatmeal is so important and rarely am I blown away by it. The consistency, temperature, and texture was ideal. I don't know if it's this perfect every time, but I suspect so. I don't believe that hitting the bulls eye on every single dish was an accident. These people know food.  Atmosphere..... Okay, so it's in a shopping center and it looks like you're at your grandmother's house. And? Did you come for interior decorating advice? Neither did I. It's clean, the service was fantastic and the food was better than many fine dining establishments.  Go here. You will be glad you did.   Darn.... Only thing I'd change is the coffee. Weak, with a dirty water flavor. With food this good, they need a rich, dark, robust coffee. If I'd had that, my head may have exploded from the experience.",

So if you're a small person or don't have a big appetite - share.   Must have some banana bread. It comes out fresh and hot from the oven, so soft and moist. I would go there just to eat that.   I must say that driving up to Omelet House had me a little worried because from the outside it looks a little sketchy and even the decor on the inside is kinda iffy but I guess that doesn't matter when the food comes out.

    "text": "== Food ==  It's fantastic, but the standard options and portions are not for the health-conscious. The star menu items are, of course, the omelets, of which there are 34 to choose from, including quite a few unique combinations (lobster, shrimp, salmon, etc.) I've tried a few of them at this point and have left happy every time.  All breakfast items come with \"spuds\" (thinly sliced fried potatoes) and a choice of toast, english muffin, homemade bread or tortillas. You want to get the bread (Pumpkin Nut or Banana Nut, both are great). While the potatoes and rest of your meal will be tasty, I am sad for people who don't order one of the breads. You are truly missing out should you pass on it.  For the health conscious, you'll want to downgrade to a \"baby\" omelet, which would more accurately be named the \"adult human\" size. The standard omelet portion is more appropriate for horses or elephants. There are also options for splitting a dish, substituting a side for sliced banana or fruit cup and using egg beaters, egg whites or swiss/feta cheese, all for additional cost. The Omelet House has ways to make their offerings more healthy but it's going to cost extra.  There are also traditional American lunch items (sandwiches, hamburgers) but if you're visiting from out of town, stick with breakfast. The one exception might be the fried zucchini which is worth getting (but also terrible for you.)  == Environment ==  The folksy environment is a far cry from the glitz and glamour of the strip but it's an island of authenticity in what tends to be a sea of garish veneer during a trip to Las Vegas.  The place is tucked inside one of the hundreds of strip malls that make up most commercial districts within the city and seems to cater to a split of tourists and locals.  == Summary ==  As you can probably tell, I'm a huge fan of the Omelet House. The food alone is worth a 5-star rating, but the charges for all the healthier substitutes and the spotty wait staff (who range from extremely friendly to mildly contemptuous) docks a star.  That said, the Omelet House is a standard part of every trip I take to Vegas. The casinos can be cruel but giant omelets, fried potatoes and amazing bread never fail me.  If you're still reading at this point: you should go. Thank me later.",

The last piece of advice is especially True because the omelettes served here are huge.  I definitely had trouble finishing an omelette myself (I didn't finish).  The fried zucchini could be a meal in itself.  Crisp batter, tender zucchini, and ranch and cheese sauce.  Doesn't get better than that.  One thing to remember if you decide to go here is that their portions are HUGE.  The country in decor is cute and the servers were all around some of the nicest people I met in Vegas. Definitely sharing next time, but not the banana bread or the pumpkin bread or the zucchini.  :)",

We went for breakfast and it was nothing short of fantastic. I got the corned beef hash and it was without doubt the best I have ever had. Real corned beef, big chunks of meat that were tender and tasty. The hash was moist and not at all dry. I got the banana bread to go along with it and it too was excellent. The homemade potatoes are like potato chips and were a bit weird for breakfast, but that did not stop me from eating almost all of them. The wife loved her turkey eggs benedict. The best she ever had. She got the pumpkin bread. The breads are obviously homemade and fresh because our were hot out of the oven. The portions are huge. This place is a deal and a steal. I just wish that Dallas had a place like this. If you are in Vegas and love good breakfasts, you have to go here.",

Not to mention regular breakfast offerings such as fluffy waffles with a hint of almond flavor. They also offer lunch, burgers, sandwiches and soup. The Fried Zucchini is amazing, light batter around thick cut spears of squash. I ordered the Lobster Fest omelette, baby sized for .89 cents less, its 3/4 the size of the reg omelette avail on any omelette, this was stuffed with chunks of sweet luscious lobster and slices of buttery avocado. Accompanied by homestyle spuds and choice of warm pumpkin nut bread, toast, or when available, banana bread. I always say I'm going to try lunch, but inevitably end up with a scrumptious omelette.",

    "text": "Was in Vegas for the weekend and decided to go to this place based on reviews and we did not want to go to IHOP as it gets old sometimes. we were a party of 7 adults with 3 children, we go seated right away which is always great when you have a large party. we got the menu and the first thing we noticed is that the kids menu was for children under 10 years old. with two 11 year old that was disappointing. so we were forced to order from the regular menu and mind you that if you decide to share a plate, there was an additional charge of $.90. which is the first i have heard of for breakfast. the second thing we noticed was how expensive this place is, and I'm from the San Diego area where there is pricey food. i was shocked to see that every omelet was between $9 to $10 dollar range which did not include a side of pancakes (maybe IHOP wasn't too bad). when we got our food it was plenty, but maybe not as much when you decide to share an omelet. My son ordered ordered short-stack of pancakes which only contained two pancakes..go figure, everywhere else a short-stack is usually 3 pancakes. My son will eat just about any kind of pancakes as long as there is enough syrup pour on them. Well, let me tell you, when my kid turns down pancakes, there is something wrong with them. i had a taste and they tasted like someone took a McDonald's pancake and put it in the microwave too long, after a while they were stiff as a board. The banana bread was Very tasty but the food in my opinion was nothing special and certainly not worth the $114 we spent at this place for breakfast. I could tell no one else was too impressed with the food as they had some left over and no one wanted  take the leftovers with them.  I was not a fan of having potato chips served with breakfast, with no options of having anything else. one last thing, if you want to order a \"baby size\" which basically is half the size of a regular omelet....you save a whole $.98 cents.....what a ripoff.  sorry Omelet House you are too pricey and food was not all that great...maybe i have high expectations for $10 omelets.",

I had the popeye omelette which has spinach, mushrooms, jack cheese, and I added bacon. Then they give you the option of pumpkin bread or toast. I had the pumpkin bread which came out first, steaming hot with a side of butter. very good! Overall, this place is a fun breakfast spot to check out. Kinda hole-in-the-wall, country diner feel, but tasty! The only disappointment was weak coffee, and we'd been up since 6:30, so I needed it.

The BF had omelet, potato chips, and french toast.  The kids shared one pancake and had soda pop.  My french toast was delicious, and I tried some of the BF's banana bread (that came with the omelet), and it was good.  Our bill was $32 (without tip).  The wait wasn't that long, and the service was great.  The decor was really homey too.  There was also a lady that came around to each table to see if the kids wanted balloons.  Our table said yes, and she proceeded to make a dog and a bunny for the kids.  I tipped her $5 for the balloons.    The only reason I deducted a star was because I would have liked for them to have coloring books and crayons for the kids.  I also would have liked to see a little more interaction with the kids as well.  But overall, great place, and I would go here again!",

The price is definitely right and most people were getting to go boxes because the portions are huge and it was my only meal of the day!

    "text": "4 stars: Yay! I'm a fan.  In the past, I'd always ask if the grunion were running, but lately, it seems some of the waitstaff isn't as familiar with the menu as I am, so I've kind of stopped asking.   The potatoes here are excellent.   If you transplanted them to just about any low/mid 20s zagat-rated steakhouse, you'd be paying between $7 to $12 bucks for these cottage fries. Really, really nice potatoes. I prefer them to the $7 fries at Bouchon. Dead serious.   The banana bread is good, be sure to have some when it's available. The pumpkin nut bread is pretty good as well.  I like to order the breakfast sandwich, which is essentially a BLT + fried egg, or more economically, breakfast bacon sandwich with a side of lettuce and tomato instead of the cheese.   The omelets are all pretty large. Depending on your ability to put away a 6 egg omelet you may be pleased or intimidated when you see it in front of you.   The lobster benedict that a lot of reviewers rave about isn't as good as you would imagine. Something isn't quite right with the lobster or the Hollandaise. It's not their best menu item, and there's so many other things to eat here, I'd skip it.  I've been eating here for a very long time, and I have always found the service to be personable and relatively quick. However, I avoid this place on weekends.   I am told that weekends can be quite hectic at peak breakfast hours.  Also, they aren't really open very early for a breakfast spot (7am), so it's not exactly a place for early birds or night owls looking to grab a late post-afterhours meal.  It's an affordable place to eat north of the strip. It isn't the best breakfast spot in the world, but it does the trick about 96% of the time, so it's a solid 4-star place for me, and one of the few staples on my reliable vegas eats list.  Multiple locations, but the one on Charleston is the one I tend to gravitate towards.",

    "text": "I had never been to this Omlete House before I went with 8 of my co-workers for our annual holiday lunch. Given there were so many of us I called ahead to make a reservation. Well, it turns out they don't take reservations. I was told to call back about an hour before we wanted to eat so they would have a heads up. No problem.  We showed up about 11:45 and were led back to an area of the restaurant where tables could be put together for the nine of us. We were led back quite a long way too. It turns out the Omlete House is massive. There must be three or four dining areas. The hallways and corridors wind through like a labyrinth through dozens of antique decorations adorning the walls. Paintings, copper art, knick knacks Coke signs. Some of it is for sale. Some of it is not. It gives a lot to look at while waiting for your food.  The food was good. Some of my co-workers ordered omletes as that is the specialty here. Me personally, I don't care for breakfast so I ordered a pastrami sandwich on marble rye. The pastrami was sliced thick and stacked not super high but high enough to be pleasing. The rye bread was too toasted for my liking and tore up my mouth. But it tasted good enough that it didn't really matter. On the side was the \"famous\" potatoes that I don't actually like. They are almost like chips but not as thin and not as crisp. Potatoes that don't know what they want to be. Not that it made any difference. I ate most of them anyway. What really stood out was the fried zuchinni we ordered for the group. Batter fried rather than breaded and seasoned too. It was delicious. And it came with two dipping sauces. Ranch dressing and cheese sauce. I ate my pieces plain. Still good. I also was given a co-workers pumpkin bread. That might have been my favorite part of lunch. It was moist and loaded with pumpkin spice and topped with walnuts. Fantastic.  This was a good lunch at a cool place with accomodating staff.",

    "text": "Let me start my review by saying the reason why I gave it four stars is because it's kind of in the ghetto but once you get in there you feel like you walked into your grandma's house and it makes all that ghetto-Ness go away LOL.  OK now down to the nitty-gritty of the review. First off let me say that we had a large party and they quickly accommodated all of us we waited about 10 minutes to get seated. Our servers were always coming to our tables asking us if we needed anything, not to mention they had a packed out house. Inside disestablishment is like a blast to the past I took so many pictures of little Nick Nack's and pictures that were hanging on the wall because they were things that I had seen in my moms house or my grandmas house. I really enjoy the ambience of this restaurant very homey feeling and the food was really good. I ordered the Chile Verde omelette and I must say it was delicious, if you're not a big eater this is probably something you could split with another adult I only ate half of mine and I was stuffed. With every plate they give you a side of homemade potato chips let me just say bomb! When they ask you if you want toast English muffin pumpkin or banana nut bread make sure you get the Punkin bread it was to die for and it was a huge serving once again I split it with one of the kids.   I will definitely be visiting this establishment when we return to Vegas on next year's family vacation.",

    "text": "Let's be honest, the place is a bit dingy at first glance from the outside. The painted cinderblock exterior is plain, somewhat dirty, and the sign doesn't indicate that things get any better inside. Once you walk in, your initial thoughts are confirmed, and you are blasted in the face with decor that is a mash up of country western \"goodness\" from the 1940s (i.e. probably John Wayne's living room) to the 1970's brown and orange color palette and stained glass craze.   Yet, inside the establishment, your doubts peak, then fall. You begin to appreciate this restaurant. The service is good, friendly, and honestly, the decor grows on you. Though I was not entirely comfortable in the generic restaurant seats with their metal frames and paltry cushions, I looked around in awe. Of course, my vision was not without constant reminders that I was indeed in Las Vegas, but this is True of most establishments in this tourist hotspot.  I ordered an omelette with shrimp and cheddar cheese, though the official name escapes me; it was decent. Furthermore, the shrimp was cooked sufficiently, and I wasn't left with the feeling that the shrimp was left in a tepid pool of water to thaw. In addition to the omelette, I received potatoes. These were quite good as well. It was A LOT of food, and the prices were not exorbitant either.  All in all, I am indeed a fan. A big fan, actually. If you can get past the looks of the interior and exterior, you'll have experienced a gem in Las Vegas.",

First off, every single person who saw me standing there waiting to be seated asked if I had been helped so I was waiting like 45 seconds. SUPER friendly, fast and efficient. This is the quickest place I think I have ever been to. Like....ever. But they don't lack in quality which is the amazing thing!  The first 2 days I had different omelettes.....both were delicious. Last day I was in a MEGA hurry (but they are always fast...) I couldn't believe it when my food came even faster just because I said I needed to get out of there in a hurry and the food was still fresh and tasted great!  You get HUGE portions - like I could order an omelette and split it. I would have taken portions home but it would have sat in my hot car and that wouldn't have been good. Prices are reasonable so no need. Last day I got a sandwich expecting that it would be just ok since it is an omelette place, the sandwiches wouldn't be all that great. BUT I was pleasantly surprised!   Everything I have eaten here has been fab, service is excellent and very, very quick with orders and it is still fresh! I would absolutely recommend and would go out of my way to come back often. Zero complaints as everything was better than expected. Wow. I think I will even bring out of town visitor here to this location. Yeah - it was that good. Wish I would have cut into the omelette and THEN taken the pic because it was stuffed full of goodies and not just a wad of egg. It's worth it. Go there. I'm sure I'll be back and I'll update with pics of the insides. ;)",

Come find the Omelet House.  You'll notice that this place is huge. Twice as large on the inside than from the outside. Seated quickly and waited on quickly. Few different servers helping us. A nice woman got me an iced mocha but hinted that it wasn't that great and she'd make another one if I asked. First sip was nothing but lukewarm ice water so I got another one made, sans ice. Not great either but she was super helpful about the whole thing.  We stuck to omelets, didn't come here to eat salad. I got the 38 Special with ham, bacon, sausage and a couple of cheese. That hit the breakfast spot. And then some. And then more. I've learned that any restaurant that ends in \"house\" ain't messin around. These omelettes tasted amazing even as leftovers.   And I just wanted to say, the service was very friendly. The server was extremely nice and attentive. Made us feel welcome, even advocating me to ask for a better Mocha. That says a lot about a place.",

With a like almost outside (and was way beyond outside when we left) we are please to say this was an amazing experience and we are still talking about it! The staff, the customer service and oh my gosh that Omelet that I had! I had the Lobster something. It was so good! My BF said his was good too. He eats very healthy. And he was extremely impressed when they had turkey sausage AND turkey bacon! If you are ever in town make a point to go here, you will not be disappointed. And if there is a line outside. It's totally worth the wait!",

They also have a light weight portion of three eggs. We shared the King of Hearts. It was very good.

Why did I not turn around right then you ask???? Great question,,, I am going to say that the stench is so overwhelming it puts you into a mild coma and you are not able to clearly function or think straight.  That caused me to to stay.  I was also having not such a good morning so I just gave in and figured something to eat would help.  I ordered a polish sausuage sandwich on sourdough.  Let's just say that the cup of mustard that was on this aboration was too much to handle.  I brought it up to the server who could care less excetp to say \"Yeah, that's a lot of mustard\".  That was his solution.    So in a nutshell: 1) The restaraunt smells like a combination of a dirty fish market and a sewer. 2) The food cannot really be called that.  The slop they serve is litterally unedible.   3) The service staff has ZERO clue what service is and how to take care of anyone.    This place should honestly be blown up.  What a pit of despair.",

I called in an order of blueberry stuffed french toast, with 2 eggs, and 2 slices of bacon. It was ready when I got there to pick it up and all of the food was still piping hot when I got home. Everything that I ordered was delicious, it definitely helped the after effects of my indulgence in spirits from the night before. The best part about the entire meal was the pumpkin bread I warmed up later on for a snack. I usually make my own breakfast but any time I'm not feeling up to it (especially after a night of drinking), Omelet House will be my breakfast restaurant of choice.",

    "text": "I would rate this place a 4.5 out of 5 stars.  I loved this place.  Locals seem to be flocking here.  The parking wasn't the best as it was a crowded shopping center.  The food was outstanding for breakfast.  From start to finish the service was great.  The waitress was super friendly and attentive.  The food was fresh and hot.  The -.5 would be for the restroom being kind of dirty.    I've heard you can tell a lot about a restuarant on how clean the restrooms are.  If they are messy chances are the kitchen is messy and dirty as well. Here the restroom was a bit dirty, but nothing too much to complain about.  After I'm giving them 4.5 stars.  If you are staying downtown and want a good breakfast, get in a car or cab and check this place out.  Better than any breakfast on Fremont street.",

Hubby had the Mile High omelet which he said was full of good ham in between smacks! He also wishes he had got the junior as the regular size was huge! If you have kidsI suggest they split a junior. Petunia omelet is loaded with crisp bacon...take your BP meds people!! The spuds are crispy, more of a good potato chip than a hash brown but quite tasty. Waffle is light and fluffy with warm syrup! Ooooh the BANANA BREAD... Trust any Yelpers who advise you to get this it is warm, full of nuts you must get it there and extra to go for later!!!!  Just Gooo!",

Aside from all the amazing offerings here, hands down I must say that I was hooked on the Lobster Benedict from the first time I had it.  It has been hard to try anything else, especially since I don't normally frequent this place unless I need a fix.    Although, the lobster chunk sizes has been varying, I understand that there are many factors that affect this such as, season, the economy and even natural disasters...yes i get deep when it comes to food yall.  Please believe me...budabyebye....  I have yet to ask if it is genuine lobster meat, it would shatter me to learn otherwise, but if yall get a chance to ask, let me know the verdict.  The OJ tastes like pasteurized and from concentrate, not fresh squeezed, but not why I am there.  Someone can verify this as well. #PassingTheBuck  Although, my favorite breakfast place is still Cinnamon's back in Honolulu (half and half lox with kalua pork benedict), this place goes an extra step with the exquisite nobleman offering of the king of shell fishes.  Baby Stacks attempts to give Cinnamon's some rubs, and aside from convenience, does a decent job with their own kalua pork benedict.  Next time, I may get creative and add spinach or maybe grilled onions, we shall see.  In the meantime, let me know what you guys think of it, grazi!",

This place is entirely too crowded and loud to expect actually enjoying a meal. I ordered an omelet and hashbrowns. I directly stated HASHBROWNS, but they brought me....potato chips... and they were covered in the most disgusting moldy herb mixture that unfortunately, it seems the kitchen covers everything with, it was dumped all over my omelet as well. The one, and I mean ONE saving grace of this place was the side of bread. I got the pumpkin bread and another of my party got the banana nut bread. Both were amazingly moist and flavorful. I would highly recommend here only to get a piece of bread to-go. I had one final awful experience, the waitress dropped off our check and disappeared, it took flagging down a table busser to grab my payment for it, even a man who I assume was the manager walked around personally seating people, but was equally as useless after departing. I personally will never return, the bread wasn't worth the rude awakening.",

I'd say it's worthy of a rating between one and one-and-a-half stars, nothing more. Coffee was so-so, but I'm not rating the coffee... Wife took a bite of her \"potatoes\" (basically homemade potato chips...  Breakfast is SO much better than potato chips, homemade or not) and warned me they were extremely salty. They were, but I enjoyed them for a few bites, then I was over them.  I love a good chorizo, so I ordered the chorizo omelette with flour tortillas.  Maybe the cook was being heavy-handed with the salt today, maybe it's always this way, I don't know, but all I can say is that we will not return.  Chorizo is salty anyway, but this was terribly salty.  And the tortillas?  I'd swear they were purchased from a supermarket, taken out of the wrapper, put on a plate and microwaved. My wife ordered sausage and eggs.  She felt the sausage was from the freezer aisle from the same supermarket. I am far from a food snob and love a good dive/greasy-spoon restaurant every once in a while, but I feel like Yelp let me down on this one.  A cheap Vegas buffet would have been more satisfying today.",

The place gives off a very homey, small town, local feel. Coffee was refilled without us asking! Per the recommendation of our waitress, we ordered the Californian Omelet, banana bread and the Biscuits and Gravy. Yum!!! Good choices all around. The banana bread was super moist, flavorful and tasted so yummy with the whipped butter, The omelet is huge so I understand why people say that it's shareable. I highly recommend getting an omelet here just because the egg actually tasted different from a lot of other omelets I've had at other restaurants. It was really fluffy, light and flavored to perfection. The combination of avocado, egg and chorizo was right on the mark. The biscuit was lightly toasted and topped with a smoky flavored gravy that was so good. I will definitely come back the next time I'm in Vegas!!",

The staff inside are super friendly and nice! We ordered a Flap special for our 2 kids to share. The waitress had the kitchen split it between two plates and they made the paclncakes into Mikey Mouse and our kids were so happy their food arrived! We also ordered the corned beef hash which is made from scratch and the chili Verde omelette. Both came with a choice of either homemade pumpkin or banana bread. I personally liked the banana bread over the strong cinnamon flavored pumpkin bread. Both also came with potato chips. The portions are large enough for two people to share, which is something we should've done. But overall, very satisfied with this place.",

Quick to take my order but wasn't ready, but perfect timing to come back and take my order. Brought an awesome salad and cup of soup within minutes. So many check-ins to see if everything was good, just amazing good service. Haven't been called hun that many times ever. :)   Simply amazing service and teamwork from all employees!   What could be better.  Wish the plates were heated to keep the food hotter longer.  Need hash-browns as option which they don't offer.  Chunks of ham needed in the split pea soup.

The potatoes were unique and delicious. Chicken Fried Steak and .38 special were very tasty. The coffee was great. We highly recommend this place and any time were in Las Vegas we will absolutely stop in. Large portions of delicious comfort food.",

It was dark and could severely use some sunlight and windows. The lack of windows gave it a mildew-like dark feeling.

The banana bread I ordered with my meal was brought out first and was very good. I had the Bugsy Siegel omelette with egg whites which was one of the best omelettes I've EVER had. There were tender roast beef chunks in a savory Italian red sauce with creamy sour cream and lots of cheese. Their signature potatoes are thin crispy slices that are a cross between potato chips and home fries. I also added a pancake which was huge and fluffy--like a larger version of an ihop pancake. Melia took great care of us as well. Overall this was a very enjoyable experience.",

I prefer smaller, simpler menus but it's all good. I ordered the \"Green Hornet\". It's the biggest omelette in the world that came with your choice of either avocado or guacamole. It also comes with cheese & tomato. Each dish also come with some spuds and your choice of either banana nut bread, pumpkin bread, toast or tortillas.   It was a pretty plain omelette, nonetheless still was good and over-filling.   Question being.....will I return for more? YES. The menu is huge and I still have yet to explore it.

Their potato chips are perfect and their banana bread is super delicious. However, today I was a little shocked that their Pastrami sandwich was dry and flavorless and the tuna melt was a bit oily than usual. I might've been because the place was supper packed than usual due to their 50% off special that the cooks rushed. I'd still come and eat here tho. I still recommend it.",

They are only open in the mornings til early afternoon, so late risers, you are missing out, but trust me, waking up early for this is most definitely worth it. You really can't go wrong with anything on their menu - everyone in our party ordered something different and nobody left feeling dissatisfied. The food is tasty, the ideal hearty breakfast that you need to get you fueled for the day. Portion-sizes are not for the weak either, or a box might be in order, we definitely all needed one. Plus we had the nicest, friendliest waitress.  Amazing food, cozy atmosphere, and great service - that's just the ingredients for the start of a great day!  PS. I wish I could say I was either team banana bread or team pumpkin bread but they're both too good, I still can't decide. Guess that means another trip is in order!",

They offer you toast or pumpkin bread. Get the pumpkin bread.  The ambiance feels like your in a country eatery. Lots of cows and  chickens figurines,  throughout the place. The best is being able to take home a few trinkets, salt & pepper shakers of cartoon characters in their glass cases. Cute stuff. Collectables. Some are Betty Boop, Popeye, the Flintstones,  Etc... Staff is very friendly and don't pressure you.",

I was skeptical about the place when I pulled up, but once I stepped in all doubts flew out the window. 4 stars for this place, only because of its location. Otherwise was a great experience!",

Had a little trouble finding the place as the signage is somewhat misleading.  There were actually 4 or 5 cars idling in the parking lot waiting for the place to open.  Everyone made a rush for the door as soon as it was unlocked.  That has to be a good sign!  It's a quaint little diner - thought I was back in the Midwest for a second!!  I went with the Kitchen Sink omelet and it was WAY too much food for even a large person to eat.  But it was quite good, so I made a valiant effort to get on the outside of this beast.  Couldn't do it, though.  The potato-chip like thingys accompanying the omelet were nothing special, but I didn't have room for them anyway.  The service was great - everyone was very friendly.

My husband had the biscuits and gravy, and it did not disappoint! He got the \"hashbrowns\" which were essentially home made potato chips and were so good!! I had an omelette (I don't remember the name) with all veggies...asparagus, mushroom, tomato, broccoli...and I am glad I ordered the \"small\" size (three eggs instead of the regular size SIX eggs ). It was so good! Prices were great, especially compared to the nearby strip! Will return!",

There are a couple items that make me come back and that would be their 'Real' Corned Beef Hash, Fresh Potato Spuds (like Potato Chips) and their homemade Pumpkin Bread. And as the name says \"Omelet\", not only are they great, they are also portioned for heavy feasters!  Homemade Pumpkin Nut Bread: Very Delightful Treat, more like a Dessert for me!  Homemade Corned Beef Hash: \"Best you ever had\" - their description.. Eventhough it wasn't quite the Best I've ever had, it was close! Chunky, Prefered and Always makes me a Happy Camper!   Fresh Potato Spuds: are super thin twirl slices of potato and lightly fried. Some parts are crispy and some are a bit chewy.. Unique, Not Filling and Delicious!  I've tried a few of their Omelets that did not Disappoint!  \"The Cowboy Special\"- homemade chilie, cheese and onions \"Farmer Juan\" - bacon, onion, tomato and cheddar cheese \"38 Special - for all you meat lovers\" - ham, bacon, sausage, cheddar and jack cheese \"Chili Verde Omelet\" - pork, green chili sauce with jack cheese  I love the Chicken Ranch Decor and their Creative Menu Item Names and Descriptions! Servers always giddy and quick to serve and Prices are Reasonable!! HHHHMMMM.. Now I'm Feeling Breakfast,..Tonight!!",

    "text": "Very long line. No one working the counter or hostess station, so getting service was chaotic at best. Food was mediocre. Not worth the wait or the chaos of fighting for a seat. If your looking for a stress free pleasant breakfast? Avoid this place.  Please see what the \"Owner\" posted to my initial review of his establishment.    3/9/2016 * I think you have the wrong Omelet House. 1.We always have 5 hosts and one owner working the door on Sundays. 2.We do not have a counter or hostess station. 3. All of our 25+ floor staff are trained to make eye contact with anyone waiting to be seated and, if they are unable to seat the customer, they say something to the effect \"Someone will be with you right away.\"  We are located at Charleston and Rancho. Read less   So, first off?  I was at the establishment listed in the \"Owners\" response.  And I have no idea where his 25+ floor staff were or his hosts for that matter.  Never saw a single one of them helping of addressing anyone at the entry.  No one ever made eye contact, no one ever even recognized we were there.  Secondly, there is a sign when you enter that states \"Pease wait to be seated\".  Thirdly, the \"owner\" states he or she has no \"hostess station but they have 5 hosts! Where do these hosts work out of? What do they do? The \"owner\" needs to accept and own an honest review of his business like it or not. But saying that, what I and my party experienced in his establishment, didn't happen because he says so? Is just a sad and weak retort.  The \"owner\" can post whatever he or she wants.  The truth will be in the service they deliver.  Personally I am insulted by the \"owners\" response, for all intensive purposes, he or she is calling me a liar.  Another sign of a poor manager and a bad business person.  Another sign and another good reason to avoid this establishment.",

They tell me that it is Farmers Brothers but I think it is a different grade. I could easily eat the banana nut bread along with 4-5 cups of coffee. That would be my definition of a good meal here.

They have a huge choice list for omelets, and the standard breakfast fare. My wife and I shared a spinach, broccoli and Bacon omelet with cheese and the server split it onto separate plates as well as the banana bread. There is a 99 cent charge for the split, but they plate it like two smaller entrees. I received my own breakfast potatoes, that are served like tender chips - Delicioso.

The service was pretty fast and super friendly. Even though we came 20 minutes before their closure, nobody rushed us out. We enjoyed our meal. The inside is pretty cool, you feel like you are inside an antique store. We live close by so we will definitely come back. This restaurant has existed since 1979 and now I understand why :) .

There were 13 of us and our server Megan was so accommodating and definitely made for a pleasant dining experience.  I shared the chicken fried steak omelet with pepper jack.   The omelet was huge, but I found the egg to be overcooked which forced me to eat around it.  It seems to me like they concentrate more in bigger and not better.    The plate also came with sliced potatoes which I believe were intended to be served either crispy or soft but not in between.  I did enjoy them however, but I think it was more my love for potatoes. Then you have a choice of their toast selection or a slice of their homemade pumpkin or banana nut bread.  Pricing isn't bad considering you can split your plate which I did, but they failed to mention there is a $1 charge for doing so.  I can see why, since the portions I am sure prompt people to do so more often than not, but my thing has always been not being made aware of it by our server.  Whether or not it is mentioned somewhere you should still be told by your server.      Overall I liked how accommodating they were for our large party and offered to split checks for us without having to ask which was very nice for a change since most eating establishments frown upon this practice which is pure laziness when they hesitate or refuse to do so.   As for the food though, I still think I can cook better eggs and yet I am not a cook.",

The food was great. Split the Chicken Fried Steak Omelet and the Blueberry Stuffed French Toast. We tried the pumpkin and banana nut bread. Both were absolutely delicious, straight from the oven warm, and just quite perfect. Service was great. Servers were helpful with the menu, offering suggestions, and always around with coffee and water refills. Can't wait to come back, try a new omelet, and have more banana nut bread!",

I had the baby sized petunia pig with bacon and cheddar, which I substituted for American and my husband had the Plymouth rock which had turkey, avocado, Jack cheese and tomato . They omlets come with potato chips and you get a choice of toast, pumpkin bread or banana nut bread. We chose toast. It was super saturated with butter, but it was yum. The chips were crispy and had a nice flavor to them. The omlets are huge! Even the baby sized, which is $1 cheaper is big. Overall, loved it.",

    "text": "Since I got back from Asia - it seems like the food portions here in the States have gotten bigger. Especially when I dropped in for breakfast at the Omelet House on Charleston.   It's been forever and a day since I last ate here and the parking sucks just as bad once the other businesses open up. The wait wasn't bad but there were a few larger parties that had to wait for their turn. I lucked out as I got there early enough and a party of one is easier to seat than two large parties.   I don't like leaving food as much as I don't care for leftovers and the portions were so big that I ended up leaving a quarter of my breakfast because I couldn't take it to go because I'd be out and about all day and it probably wouldn't have kept. The breads are awesome which I know I ate too much of - and the Omelet I had, pretty much the Denver, was tasty enough to where I didn't drop on any condiments, like hot sauce etc.   Service was ok but I think the fact that my face was buried in the paper was a sign to just take my order, bring my food, bring refills and bring my bill when I was done. I didn't need nor want much more than that.   Anyway - I was a fan back in the say - I guess I still am. Just forgot about this place after all these years.",

    "text": "I started my morning by Yelping Breakfast spots to celebrate my hunny's birthday. We were looking for a place that locals and yelpers rave about. They say this place is a gem. Once we arrived we weren't impressed by the appearance of the outside but it was 12pm and we hadn't had breakfast. Once inside we were seated within a few minutes, the host was nice. We asked for a baby chair BUT the helper brought us a high chair when u can clearly see that we had a newborn, we asked him if they had a baby chair, he was pretty rude and reluctantly brought us a baby chair. Our waitress finally arrived and she looked frazzled. She told us 5x that she would be back to take our order, we saw her walking back and forth and not making eye contact with us but she keeped saying \"I'll be back\"  finally she takes our order, & then brings back our food but my order was the ham benidict  when I had ordered the lobster Benedict, I was pretty disappointed, my tummy wanted lobster. We heard the manager talking to the table next to us, apparently our waitress didn't bring take down their order correctly and didn't bring out all their plates. We felt bad for her and cut her some slack, about 10 mins later it seems like everyone left and we had the restaurant to ourselves. Our waitress came over and apologized, she looked a lot more relaxed. Understandable that in the chaos she lost her head. It took alil bit  away from our experience, but all in all everyone enjoyed their plates.",

Being an out of towner, I found this place through Yelp the last time and found it again through Yelp, without realizing that I've been here before.  Both times, I was very happy with the choice.  It's a breakfast / brunch type place with good food.  The ambiance is very fitting.  You'll find a very eclectic mix of people.  I had three OLD people next to me, a gay couple across the room, and a bunch of families and younger couples too.  The decor is all wood paneled in a woodsy cabin from the west sort of look.  I liked it.  It's simple and clean.  The location is about 3.5 miles from the mid-strip and a short car-ride away.  It's in a strip mall with nothing going for it from the outside.  It's got a cheesy \"Voted Best Breakfast\" banner outside and from the looks of it, you'd never tell that it's crowded and popular inside.  I got the egg white omelet and a pancake.  The omelet comes with your choice of toast, pumpkin bread, and banana nut bread.  I chose the last one and it came piping hot and really tasty.  I put butter on it and ate it up.  It was also a good sized.  Everything was good sized.  The omelet was huge and tasty and perfectly done.  The side was potatoes thinly sliced like chips but more soggy like fries.  I liked it.  The pancake was also tasty and perfectly prepared.  It was like 9 inches across and 1 would be more than enough for most people.  I had to take it to go after finishing my omelet.  This place is good for American breakfast food prepared right at very reasonable prices.  I'd recommend this to anyone looking for exactly that.",

Choosing one of 20+ omelet varieties is probably the best bet, since they could feed a family of four. Side of home fries or chips, big cup of unlimited coffee, and you are a champion.",

    "text": "This is the best homestyle cooking restaurant in Las Vegas. We heard about this place through the Entertainment Book (coupons not accepted on holidays). First of all the inside is Kitsch- it's like Grandma's house, basically. Prices are reasonable- about $10.00 per person. We've been come here for breakfast and lunch- open 7 am to 3 pm daily. The best thing for breakfast is the Eggs Benedict Lobster for $9.89- two  eggs, avocado, chunks of lobster, hollandaise sauce on top of an english muffin. It's heaven! We've had the other omelets but if we come for breakfast,  we always order the Eggs Benedict Lobster- we love it. Lunch is usually burgers (my husband gets the mushroom burger for $7.69- mushrooms, american cheese, lettuce, tomato & 1000 island dressing) or sandwiches- like the Cajun Joe- cajun seasoned chicken, mayo, lettuce and tomato for $7.99  (but there are other things on the menu like salads & chili). Both breakfast and lunch is served with their signature potato, spuds, which is really good (unless you have them soggy, which happened once).   Service is usually very good. This location is like  a tee-pee. Especially crowded on sunday mornings. Local celebs eat here. This is one place I would really recommend to out-of-towners and other locals alike.",

    "text": "Went there with a bunch of ppl. Got seated very quickly for abotu a party of 20 people which was kinda surprising. But this place was more like an Omelet Mansion the size of the place.   Reason for the deductions in stars was because a friend noticed there was actually a cockroach crawling all over his utensils. I alerted the waiter or whoever was helping out and didnt realyl get an acknowledgement that this was not right. We could've been asses and created more trouble, but we were there for a family function and didnt want the rest of family to be bothered if we changed venues.   A star is added due to the good service by the waitresses that handled us.   I'm sorry about the bad review, and I know sometimes as a business, things can be alittle out of their hands, but regardless, a cockroach was found and on the eating utensils and table.   HK's parting shot --  -- raid please.",

I had the scramble with the potato chips, the chips were very salty and over seasoned.  The wait was a bit long and the coffee a bit watered down but overall a good breakfast place.  It's old school and a total local's joint.  Sadly our first choice down the street recently burned down so we gave this place a try based on Yelp reviews.  If you want something different and away from the strip this place will satisfy.",

If there were such a thing I think I'd call it a biker breakfast boutique ... LOL.  Food:  The breakfast was certainly one of the best that we encountered on our journey.  The omelet was indeed huge and all the ingredients were fresh and delicious.  The pancakes were also very large and fluffy, tasty treats.  Even the waffle was good, crispy on the outside, tender in the middle.  Bottom line: Can't go wrong here - great food, great service.  Only thing slightly lacking might be the ambiance, but seriously, it's breakfast ... shut up and eat.",

    "text": "I've got two words for this place big food. Normally on our lunch hour we go in here and I am always going to get the California omelette it has avocado sausage and cheese. I really can't think of anything better. I always get the baby omelette it only takes off about $.95 but I'm telling you you won't notice that it's baby because it's huge plus you get these fries which are more like chips and they have this crazy salty peppery chivey deliciousness on top of them. You also get your choice of bread and believe me people always rave about the pumpkin bread and people always rave about the banana bread I don't eat bananas and all of the breads have walnuts which I also don't eat so I just get a side of sourdough toast which is great. So yesterday my friend convinces me to try the chicken fingers and oh my gosh. So generally they ask you if you want ranch with them but read the menu closely because you get to choose between ranch and cheese sauce. That's right cheese sauce how evil genius is that?? It is so good and it still comes with those wonderful chips",
