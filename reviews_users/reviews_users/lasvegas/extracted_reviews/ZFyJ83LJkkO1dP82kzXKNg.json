They only have their Cane's sauce (a tangy, chipotle mayo mix i didn't like) and Louisiana hot cause. The fries are the ruffled ones (too soggy) and the Texas toast isn't good at all (soggy as well and needs garlic or something to make it taste better). All in all the chicken is pretty solid. It's not great by any means - I'll pass going forward unless I am craving chicken and no nuggets / chick-fil-a is around.",

    "text": "I LOVE chicken.  It's one of my favorite foods, especially chicken fingers.  We were in Vegas for a birthday, and the birthday boy had another friend pick up a dinner box from Raising Cane's for him before we went out to the club that night.  Since I love chicken I asked if I could have a piece just to try.  I ate it plain, I usually don't put a lot of sauces on my chicken fingers.  I would have to say it was ok, and I was really buzzed when I took a bite.  So the next day, I'm still craving chicken.  We decide to go to Raising Cane's again, but we will eat there.  We went there and the line was pretty long for a fast food restaurant and the dining room wasn't the biggest (maybe sitting 30 people), so we tried to decide which meal to get, our group was six people, thinking the tailgate would be enough.  After more thinking, we just decided to get our own meals.  I shared with my bf, I forgot which size we got but I ate about three chicken fingers.  I would have to say it tasted better than the night before, plus I tried it with the Cajun dipping sauce each platter comes with, I liked it.  The sauce was a mayo base with Cajun spices mixed it with it, simple one may think, but it's what made the chicken taste even better.  The fries that came with the meal were decent and didn't outshine the chicken.  I didn't eat the cole slaw, I don't like it, but my bf did and he thought it was one of the best he has had.  I took a nibble on the toast but all I couldn't anything on it.  And the sweet tea wasn't bad either.  Not too sweet, not too bitter.  I will totally come here again, but will not get it to go because it tastes a lot better at the restaurant than eating at the comforts of your hotel room.  There are other Raising Cane's in the area too.  I think many of them are build ab round major colleges, this one near UNLV.  So if you like Louisiana-style fried chicken finger or get sick of eating a buffets in Vegas go to Raising Cane's.",

Staff was friendly, place was clean and the food was great.  Chicken was truly moist and juicy, fries were crisp, Texas toast was moist and tasty and the sauce was a great addition.  My wife tried the sweet tea she said those reviews were accurate as well.  It is not glamorous or fancy but for good fresh food at a good price, this place is a must visit.",

Now, the bad:  The place is way too noisy.  The muzak (up-to-date, but STILL muzak) is blasting.  The restaurant itself amplifies the din with hard floors, walls and ceiling.  And then the patrons seem to find it essential to shout at one another over the already intolerable noise.  It never occurs to people that I really DO NOT CARE about their personal issues with a family member or coworker, and I sure in blazes don't want to HEAR about it.  More bad:  I don't care if Maryland and Tropicana ARE homeless central.  When I need to/want to use the restroom, I shouldn't have to go request a key from the cashier.  I won't return, no matter how hungry I get, and not even to give Cane's another chance because of the locked restrooms.",

Without even stopping by the strip or our hotel yet, we came straight here right after exiting the freeway after a 6 hour drive waiting to fill our hungry stomachs with chicken. Perfect meal to start or end your Vegas weekend.  I got the box combo. The chicken was fresh, still steaming and made to order, and super tender and crispy. The sweet tea is a must! I also love the bread. So glad my friend didn't want it so I could have a second slice. It's buttery and perfectly toasted on the outside, and soft and warm on the inside. I opted for the box combo since it has coleslaw included. Makes for a nice fresh touch when mostly everything on the plate is fried. And of course as everyone's already mentioned, the sauce is great.  You definitely get your money's worth! Not expensive at all and you'll most likely be taking a box to go for your leftovers. A sure go to next time I'm in town.",

    "text": "Raising Canes is raising the bar in casual fast food. My first visit in a Raising Canes was a similar experience to Panda Express. I am hooked and keep wanting to return.     Regardless that Raising Canes is named after a canine, it is fast food for a King. At Raising Canes you are not a number. When your order is ready, they will call you by your name. And there are times where they will deliver your food to you.     The combos are abundant in quantity and quality. My favorite is the Caniac Combo. It includes:   *6 chicken fingers..tasty & huge.   *2 canes sauces..little bowls instead of packets. Kind of tastes like 1,000 Island.   * Coleslaw......very good.   * Fries.....tastes like supermarket fries (don't they sell White Castles and Nathan's hot dogs in supermarkets anyway?). Still good   * Texas toast....usually full by the time I get to it.    * 32 ounce drink.....Nothing bad to say about Coke beverages. Still, it would be cool if they had 100 flavors like Five Guys or the new Burger Kings.    The one negative is that Raising Canes is not cheap. To be fair the prices of fast food have escalated in recent times. So $8.96 for a Codiac Combo, which is a dollar above the average fast food meal, is not off the charts expensive.     Raising Canes is raising the standard of fast food. Now when I pass an out-of-business fast food restaurant, I know what I want to see go in there.",

I LOVE the food here, and I go all the time, but I'm giving a 3 star because of the way the restaurant is set up. The drink machine is too close to the counter so it's always packed over there and hard to refill your drink. There's nowhere for the line to go other than right by other people's tables. I was sitting in the last booth before the order counter and I could barely hear my mom who was sitting right next to me. On top of that, the restaurant's music is always reeeeeaaaaally loud. I wouldn't suggest eating inside the restaurant if you want to be able to actually enjoy eating and conversation. I've had a couple really unfortunate incidences in their ladies restroom. It's either really clean or it's a nightmare, although this isn't really their fault since customers are usually teenagers and even some of the lesser well off people around the area. I'm usually fine with waiting for my food because it's just too good to never wait in line for it. Overall, I'd suggest going at times that aren't height lunch or dinner times, because I've seen the line get all the way out the door. They really should've made this location bigger.",

Texas toast is tasty and fluffy.  Before leaving vegas we made a pitstop here for lunch for us and then an hour later another pitstop at the Raising Cane's in Vegas' southeast location!",

I found it to be rather distasteful.  Even the cashier who rang me up called her out on it but she continued.  The whole thing made it hard for me to enjoy my meal.",

He lives on the east side, and it seems there are no locations on that side of town.  This location is close to UNLV, and therefore has mostly college students as patrons. Today was the worst experience here for us. the music was so loud that it caused everyone to yell to the person across from them. It was nearly impossible to hear my own family talking. The food here is always hot, but there is something off about this place. My guess is that the fryer grease is old. It just doesn't taste fresh. This was my last time coming here.",

Food was really good chicken tenders were a good size and not dry at all. Fries are fries they should have specialty fries like garlic butter, seasoned ones, you get my idea. The price between serving quantities is not much off a difference from the price. I recommend getting the 6 pcs roughly  $8 and change with fries and 32oz soda dipping sauce (to die for) coleslaw and a good size butter toast (Really good and soft) Other then that it a great place.",

Unfortunately, I no longer had energy and desperately needed food. When I looked to my left I saw a fast-food building called Raising Cane's. Ever since that fateful day, I have been addicted.  Raising Canes has got to be one of my favorite fast food places for chicken! Their chicken fingers are always yummy, and the dipping sauce for them is so good. It adds a kick of flavor to each chicken finger, and tastes great with the fries and texas toast as well! My favorite thing about eating here has to be the texas toast. Please order extra, you will not regret this decision. If you don't care for coleslaw like me, you can ask them to trade it out for another piece of toast! It's so great!   I definitely recommend coming here if you like cheap, but delicious fast food.",

The cane's sauce bursts with flavors of different spices. The soft Texas toast has a nice buttery taste and the cold coleslaw with the hot fries matches well with each other.

Now this chain is popping up in San Diego, Costa Mesa, Downey.   It doesn't matter if you walk-in or use the drive-thru - the line is long.  Don't leave the wait is faster than you think.  Your choice is simple: Chicken tenders, Texas bread with coleslaw.  Don't forget the dipping sauce or crack sauce. Don't forget the lemonade.  Oh they give you french fries that are also pretty good!  I am surprised on how hot the chicken is every time!    That's it.  Get ready to plan your return.  I'm addicted.",

    "text": "Okay I cannot brag enough about this place and I have wrote to headquarters to beg them to open a store over here in the East Bay. One of the things I love the most about Raising Cane's is that I can eat it LOL. They do not use peanut oil and they don't make the menu some huge fanfare they keep it simple. They have the best chicken fingers around and I cannot not stress that if there is one place to visit this is the place to visit in Vegas. I look forward to my trips because I know I will be getting some Cane's. Not only is  the food consistent in all their restaurants but the price is so cheap. If you look at the pic you would see how much food you get and in the Bay it would cost more to go to McDonald's then to go the Cane's. I love the atmosphere, you can't beat having a disco ball on the ceiling right? They show support to our Rebels at UNLV by offering literally starving student discounts.  When you order your food they bring it to your table and they also help clean up your food. Now that is some superior service for a fast food joint right? The restroom are very clean too which I totally appreciate. The tables and floors are constantly being cleaned which I love too. So if you make it out to Vegas just like the M&M store and Coke Store put this on the list of places to visit. You will not regret it, and if you have kids or a big family you really won't regret it because you can't beat the quality of food or the price. :}",

Had to ask what sauces they had.  Impressed with how clean the place was. Staff was quick to wipe down tables as customers left. Super impressed that they use disposable wipes for wiping tables and not dirty reusable rags that spread germs around. I've never seen that anywhere else! Good job management! Will definitely be back! Best meal (and cheapest) if our trip! Better than Wolfgang Puck's!",

I grew up working for KFC in my teenage years, dined on Church's and Pioneer Chicken (sorry, I'm reminiscing) and enjoy the crunch of Popeye's so I had a few fast food chicken in my life. My nephew told me to try out Cane's since he knew we were going to Vegas. I did and I loved it.  The menu is simple.. There are set numbers of meals... 3,4, 6 pieces of chicken tenders with fries, texas toast, coleslaw and a drink. Or if you have a lot to feed, they have their tailgate numbers.. 25, 50 or 100. No need to worry about spicy or regular, crispy or original or roasted or whatever else to confuse your hungry mind. They had it figured out that when a customer is hungry, the last thing they want to do is go through a gauntlet of choices. Sometimes, simple is best. The chicken was very good. Coating was crispy but not too thick. The chicken itself was moist, flavorful and not dry. The Cane sauce complimented the chicken well.. not spicy but a little tangy to not overpower the star, which is the chicken.   Overall.. my first time at Raising Cane's was good (at this location at least). Service was quick and friendly and the place was very clean. It is fast food but it's a good alternative to the others out there. Now if they can only come to the Bay Area...",

The food was amazing!! The sweet tea tastes exactly like McDonald's sweet tea....still refreshing. The chicken fingers and toast were ON POINT.  The service was just as great as the food. Each employee had a smile on their face and were never hesitant when I asked for something.  Definitely a place to eat when you want something different and fast, especially if you're not from Vegas.

Raising Cane's is always a MUST when we go to Vegas.   I hope they open up in SoCal one day!",

At first I thought it was going to be like a mom and pop kind of restaurant. But it is actually a small chain restaurant like KFC and Popeye's serving fried chickens without the bones. The place was very clean and every time you need to use the bathroom you need to get the key.   Service: friendly and quick.  Food: The meal is simple and not much to choose from. There is type 4 type of combo meals that comes in a box. Every combo comes with number of chicken fingers or a chicken sandwich. The side is French fries, Texas Toast, special sauce, coleslaw, and large drink.   Recommendations:  I love their Texas Toast, Its warm soft and buttery not too overwhelming. Also, comes with the combo meal. To me the chicken tenders are fresh not from a bag and juicy.",

They almost closed but we are starving, so we get in there ask them if it's okay to order the meal. They said okay.  That's the first time we eat there, so we take a lil time to decide which is the best way we can share with each other the meal. Since my mom only speak Chinese, we were using Chinese to conversation with my mom. After, we done the order. I saw the staff's face was kinda showing us like he didn't want to server us.  While we are enjoying the meal, there's a strange loud man voice yelled at us \" STUPID ASIAN!\" I'm was really fcking angry at that moment.  I'LL NEVER GO TO RAISING CANE's EVER! THE FOOLISHNESS OF THE STAFFS TOTALLY LOST MY APPETITES!",

    "text": "Simply put, Cane's makes Chick-fil-A, Zaxby's and all of their other competitors look like total trash.  Let me tell you a story. It's kind of long.  Long before my wife and I moved to Vegas, we came from Chicago as tourists many times. On our very first visit, we stopped by the Atomic Testing Museum. Afterwards, looking for a cheap lunch that we couldn't get back home, we checked her original iPhone (before everyone had one) and looked up our nearby options.  We ended up at In-n-Out on Maryland, over by UNLV. It was horribly overrated. On the way over, though, we drove past Raising Cane's, and I exclaimed, \"A restaurant devoted only to chicken fingers! We HAVE to go there.\"  We didn't make it back until our next trip, and the meal I had then changed my life.  After that point, I had Cane's wherever I could find it - which was not often, since there weren't (and still aren't) any in or around Chicago. When we visited Minneapolis, we found the Cane's by the university closed on Memorial Day...so we drove to the suburbs for it. Afterwards, we bought a 32oz cup of the sauce and drove it back to Chicago. Every time we came back to Vegas, we'd have lunch here at least once - usually twice.  As you might imagine, when we moved here, we went nuts. We haven't gotten any fatter, but I did get a Caniac Club card and have racked up something like 40 visits in a year. There simply isn't any other fast food this fresh and this flavorful. When we want a cheap, delicious meal, there's only one option - box combo, double toast bbs, no slaw, extra sauce.  And that sauce is, indeed, boss. Totally fucking boss.",

They support \"The Rebellion\" which is the UNLV student section. Since I am alumni, how could I not support a business giving back to my Alma mater especially since Cane's is from the south with not particular connection to the university other than being located across the street. They also give free kids meals to crowd members who watched a mountain west basketball or football game, just as long as the rebels WON. Just make sure to save your ticket from the game.  When this location first opened I did not understand the hype and actually thought they were pricey. Gave Canes a second chance and now I love it.  The batter is not too thick like most chicken finger places and you could tell these are freshly made and not frozen. Just like everyone else I too like the Texas toast because its soft and buttery. Nice touch with crinkle cut fries and Cane's sauce, which is delish. I also like the community/university vibe of this place especially after a basketball game. They also give 10% discount, but they will ask for student ID.",

The chicken quality was great, it came with more fries than we could finish, and the Texas toast was yummy! It also came with two cups of their special sauce, which I expected to be amazing since you have to normally pay per cup on the menu. I'm probably one of the few to say it, but I didn't like it at all after one taste :/ It kinda had a weird sour taste to it. However, I'm sure everyone who grew up eating Raising Cane's would disagree haha. Otherwise, customer service was great, the restaurant was clean, and we enjoyed our meal!",

Tip: Just because someone is facing away from the stall and facing toward the sink... doesn't mean they can't see you with their peripheral vision or by simply turning their head.  THEN... I noticed she went not to the cashier area (could be forgiven if she wasn't working with food, I guess) but to the area back with all the food.  Ew.",

Plus, I get a teacher discount, so I eat there more often than I care to think about. The price is reasonable, the fries are good, and the Texas toast is to die for. If you use the drive through and there is a dog with you, they give you a treat in a little bag. And my favorite part is the staff are always friendly and happy. I go about once a week, they are inerrantly cheerful. Seems like they really like the place, and the mood in the restaurant is very positive.",

    "text": "Good Canes location, only problem is its kinda a victim of its own success in that during prime meal times it can be hard to get a table, and when one opens you gotta grab it before it can get cleaned and sit in someone else's chicken crumbs and grease.   Here's the secret for Canes tho - Breakfast Chicken! A lot of Canes (including this one) open at 9 AM, I figure a chicken basket isn't that far off from chicken and waffles for breakfast (its pretty much the same thing without syrup). There's hardly anyone there until like 10:30 or so too, plus early in the day you can be sure you're getting strips fresh out the fryer, which makes them twice as good.   Listed hours are till 1 AM every night but note the dining room actually closes at midnight. You can stay in there until 1 if you already ordered, but they lock the doors to new orders at midnight, its drive thru only for the final hour.",

Without the sauce it would be just too plain to me. I wish they had more sauce options then their house sauce. Also I got it to go and when I got to my hotel the fries were basically all soggy. I was only five minutes away.   If it was my only option to get food I would go back but I wouldn't go back because it was so good. It's ok.",

They also have some decent sweet tea. Their Texas toast isn't anything to write home about. All avid chicken finger lovers need to give this place a go. I live in Socal, so in the past, I used to make it a point to try to stop by Cane's before heading home. Luckily for me, they opened up some spots much closer to home.",

The chicken is okay (some crispy, some parts not as crispy), the fries are good, the sweet tea is great, the coleslaw has crispy lettuce and a great flavor.  But it is the DIPPING SAUCE that does it. THAT SAUCE IS SO GOOD. The TEXAS TOAST is so good. Crispy, buttery, goodness.  Great hangover cure (2nd to pho), and about 1.5 miles down Flamingo so close to the strip if you have a car.  Pro tip: switch out the coleslaw for another Texas Toast if you don't like slaw (or you love the toast)  They bring your meal to you if you dine in. Service (cashier and delivery of food) were not the fastest though.  Added picture",

Besides that, everything is great!  I usually get the Caniac combo which comes with 6 pieces of delicious, hot and perfectly breaded chicken tenders. Fries, Texas toast, coleslaw and 2 Cane's sauce which I assume is what crack would taste like, soooo addicting! It's plenty of food but I like to share. Also worth mentioning is their Sweet tea.

Agreed with Kevin P. - friendly, quick service that is better than most fast food establishments (regardless of whether you're in Vegas or not!), and they DO give personalized service. I think that it's a part of the training...even if the things they say are scripted, they actually say it and sound like they mean it. :)  I just went to the website - the story is pretty cool. The founder was basically shot down by his professor and the banks, saying that there was no way you would succeed with a chicken finger restaurant. And now he's laughing all the way to the bank with 80 locations in 13 states.   4 shakas!",

I'd get my chicken sandwich from here over KFC or Popeyes anyday; and I stopped here because it was near my bank and I had the munchies.   The story behind this place is that for a business class in LSU a professor gave the assignment to create a company that utilized every aspect of business and make a proposal. So two students made up Cane's Chicken Fingers, and the professor shot the idea down and said that it would never work.... guess they proved that guy wrong.  So enjoy raising some chicken fingers to the man for me!",

WHAT:  I have previously written a review about one of the other Cane's locations, but this is my absolute favorite location! The reasons behind my judgement is that the customer service is the best, the food is the best, and it stays 100 percent consistent!  The handful of times I have come here, I have never been let down.  There are times when the fries are either too salty, too soggy, or too crispy. Or times when the chicken fingers just don't taste how they should be tasting. But! Never has any of these incidents happened to me here!! I just may be their number one fan and proud!  The manager was an absolute sweetheart! I had forgotten my Caniac Club card, and he made it easy to accommodate me! There was one time I had forgotten my card at one of the other locations, and I couldn't redeem my box combo there! They had told me to email and or contact Cane's Corporate!! & sure did!  In summation, before I go off rambling about how much I love this location, STOP BY, ORDER SOME TOAST & SWEET TEA, AND HAVE A MARRY DAY! =D",

In fact, they told me that I should divert from BBQ in order to have a meal that was Raising Cane's. I can no longer trust a damn word out of those filthy liars' mouths.  If I was say, 20, and I had developed no culinary tastes, I can see how this place would appeal to someone. It's like, getting the golden platter at a diner: Fried chicken, fries, fried toast, and a soda.  Unfortunately, the fried chicken is REALLY hit and miss (some of the pieces I got were extremely dry) the fries are WAY too salty, and what the hell do I need a giant side of carbs for? The bread doesn't pair with anything.  The sauce is ok, it makes the bland chicken fingers so go from \"meh\" to okay, but there's a lot of mayo in there. I'd be much better off with a hot sauce of some kind, and since this is literally the only thing Cane's sells, I have no idea why anyone would come here instead of just going to Popeye's.",

I've never experienced such un-fresh food from what is supposed to be a really good fast food place. The fries were cold and soggy, the toast was mushy (which has made me awfully upset because that's the best part), and the chicken was not hot. They say it's \"fresh\" but my whole box just felt old and like it's been sitting back there for hours. Needless to say, I was disappointed and most likely will never return unless someone else wants to go there.",

    "text": "A couple of friends who were celebrating their birthdays in Vegas over the weekend wanted to try Raising Cane's for lunch. There are multiple locations around Vegas, but this one was the closest to us and off-strip.  I had no idea Raising Cane's was fast food and didn't know what to expect. The place was packed around 1:30 pm and we got into line, which moved quickly. They specialize in chicken fingers, so there aren't many options. I decided on The Box Combo, which included four chicken fingers, Texas toast, coleslaw, crinkle-cut fries their famous Cane's sauce, and a regular drink for $7. It was more than enough food for me and I couldn't finish the fries or slaw. The chicken tenders came in huge pieces and were super filling, although a bit dry on the inside but the yummy Cane's sauce helped with that.  Service was awful. The cashier who rang me up was clueless, distracted, and rude. I asked her what was in the coleslaw and she straight up giggled and said, \"I don't know.\" I just looked at her, thinking she'd ask a manager or provide some other response, but nope; all I got back was a blank stare. Okay... After that lovely exchange, she seemed completely disinterested in me and kept making googly eyes at this guy behind me, who I assume she personally knew, and basically had a side conversation with him while I was trying to order.  Overall, Raising Cane's reminds me of another chain, Chicken Now, as they're pretty much on the same playing field. To be honest, I'd rather go to McDonald's (guilty pleasure) than come here again, but I wouldn't be opposed if friends wanted to come back. But before then, I'd like to try Strip 'N Dip Chicken Strips next time since I've had that bookmarked for awhile.",

    "text": "Being somewhat new to town, I always heard the whispers of how Cane's is the best chicken place in town, etc etc. I don't know why, but I always imagined it as this hole in the wall chicken joint that just put out amazing food. Man was I surprised when I pulled up into this location for the first time.  This is a modern, clean, good looking fast food chain. It looked brand new, and things were well maintained. However, what REALLY surprised me were the staff. The person that took my order was awesome, she called me by name multiple times, anticipated what I needed, even pre filled my fountain soda cup with ice. I mean really?! Putting some ice in so I don't have to?! That's service.  Now down to the food...it was delicious. I had only ever had their chicken before after it was cold because someone brought it for a group, however this time around it was piping hot and unbelievably good.   There are a few reasons this is a 5 and not a 4. These are those reasons:  1) Great staff, loved the friendliness and helpfulness  2) The value, I expected this place to be expensive, but at around 6 bucks for a 4 strip meal...I was pleasantly surprised. That's cheaper than KFC meals, and MUCH better food!  Anyway, will be back... and frequently.",

Each location I've been to, including this one, has been consistently solid on the quality and flavor of their chicken tenders. Crispy breading, warm/soft chicken meat...I'm drooling just thinking about it. Plus, their deliciously gooey dipping sauce (still have no idea what it is, and I probably don't ever want to know because I can't imagine it being anything other than an artery-clogging mixture of very heavy sauces/dressings) is unlike anything I've had elsewhere.   The fries and texas toast are also very tasty and work well as sides, but nothing beats Cane's chicken tenders.   Not much to be said with regards to service or cleanliness. It's pretty much what you'd expect for any typical fast food restaurant. Then again, you don't come here to have food served in front of you on a silver platter. You come here to pig out and indulge on some of the best comfort food ever known to man.",

I'm more of a chicken wing/buffalo wing kind of person but the chicken tenders here are really good! They're moist, not overly battered and paired with their sauce makes for a satisfying meal. The 3 finger combo comes with 3 chicken tenders, texas toast, fries and a drink all for under $7. The fries and toast were delicious sides, I'm surprised there were so many reviews that gave them negative notes...but my fries weren't soaked in grease but were crispy and my toast was top-knotch! I was stuffed after the meal, but if you have a hefty appetite you might want to opt for a larger combo. Overall, I'm a fan !!",

I was disappointed in the small selection of meals...mainly unflavored tiny fried chicken strips with some frozen crinkle fries and a piece of bread...oh and some bland coleslaw and a not so very special sauce.  Hardly what I would consider a decent meal much less pay for it and actually feel there is a need to actually have an establishment devoted specifically to this type of food.  I mean, why develop an entire menu of meals where the main difference is the quantity of strips and sides??? The bf thought it was okay but he had to order the large meal and also ate half of mine.  The cashier was nice enough, but had either a hearing problem or attention deficit disorder...she had my drink order wrong twice...diet soda, no ice...not sweet tea with ice or diet soda with ice.  I do not understand the hype at all especially when there are so many other places to choose from.",

Now remember, this is Fried Chicken, so if you eat it occasionally, it won't be too bad for you.   I recommend ordering number 1 or number 3. Three is the largest box of strips and fries, but can easily be shared with another person. Of course, I have friends that can pound the number 3 by themselves, but I am a lightweight I guess. Number 1 is just about right and is worth the price. Also, if you are a student or police officer of some sort, you can definitely get a discount on your meal. I think it's about 70 cents.   Give it a try because it's not like any of those other Fried chickens you find out there.",

    "text": "Visiting Las Vegas from Hawaii, we wanted to try different places to eat. Raising Canes was suggested by another family member who had tried Raising Canes the last time she visited Las Vegas.  We went to the location, closest to the UNLV campus.  They have ample parking and a drive thru.  We entered in the restaurant, and it was packed with people on a late Friday afternoon. That's a good sign to try this place.  We took awhile to look at their small menu but decided to order a meal pack that comes with chicken tenders, texas toast, fries, and cole slaw. EVERYTHING WAS SO DELICIOUS! WOW! I read that they hope to open a Raising Canes in Hawaii... I seriously hope they do!   Service was quick and the restaurant was clean.  I would definitely come back to eat there again. Just writing this review is making me crave their chicken and texas toast!!! *drool*",

Basically what makes this is the sauce lol Otherwise the chicken fingers weren't anything special to me and I probably wouldn't go out of my way to eat this. I'm generally not big on fast food in general. It also may have been the fact that on this Vegas trip I've been drinking a lot and eating everything. So I didn't have much of an appetite for it. Maybe I'll have to give it another go when I'm more sober haha",

This is one place you don't really have to twist someone's arm in order to get them to go with you.  Walked in and every table was taken. Place was pretty slammed. Employees seemed to be handling it well. Restaurant was organized and clean. Manager was easy to spot. I even saw an employee grab a drink for a guest who was handicapped. It was heart warming to see. Everything to the counter, to the drink machine to the restrooms everything was clean.  Took 5 minutes exactly to order and get our food delivered while it was busy. That's great. We ordered the 6 piece platter with extra fries and Texas toast. Oh yeah and sauce :) food was delivered to me by a manager with a smile. Love seeing managers involved.   Chicken was breaded perfectly and chicken was so juicy and flavorful. Fries were crispy but not over cooked. Perfect balance. Sauce is always the best. I don't know what's in it but nom nom. If you know canes and you are still reading this why aren't you in the car already? And if you haven't had it before why are you not in your car already trying it?! :)",

We went through the drive thru.The friends I was with are huge Raising Cane's fans. First time I had their chicken tenders was at a friend's party, they ordered a whole pan of chicken tenders.   I ordered one of the meals. Chicken tenders, texas toast, and fries.   I really liked it. The chicken tenders had a good amount of batter and crisp. The toast was soft on the inside, would've preferred it grilled longer, I like my toast to have more crisp when grilled. The fries and Cane's sauce were tasty as well.

The highlight of this order are the chicken fingers, they are so crispy and tender. I especially like the fluffy, buttery texture of Texas toast and would like another one please.

Their chicken used to be crispy, but now it seems to be soggy & at times it seems like they don't replace the oil they cook in, giving off a burnt smell to the meal. I used to be a fan of their sauce, but the last few times I have visited the sauce had some discoloration inside. My last issue is with the drinks itself; tasted very watered down & a bit off, honestly tasted like their drink machine needed to be cleaned.. the drink lasted a couple of sips before me & my wife decided to both our drinks out.   I myself am now recovering from food poisoning from their bread & drink, while my wife had her stomach spoiled from their sauce. Very disappointing, won't be going to this location any longer.",

Located in the same plaza as the Target, maybe a 5-10 minute drive from the strip. Came on a Tuesday around 1 PM, it was busy, but the lines moved quickly.  They're famous for their chicken strips, so I had to get their most popular combo, The Box Combo. It comes with 4 chicken fingers, a piece of texas toast, some fries, cole slaw, and a side of the Cane sauce. After you order, you sit down, when it's ready, they'll call out your name, and bring your food to you! Great service!  The chicken fingers are DELICIOUS! Probably some of the best chicken fingers I've had. Super crispy on the outside, but still moist on the inside. The Cane sauce is pretty good, it's pretty peppery, which I liked, but other than that I couldn't really taste a flavor, maybe it was kind of tangy? All I know is that it's good with the chicken! The rest of the box is average. Fries were whatever, and the toast didn't blow me away. It was buttery and toasty, but not superb. Cole slaw wasn't the best, next time I'll be subbing the cole slaw for extra sauce!  Overall, great fast food place, definitely worth the trip out if you're visiting Vegas. It's also cheaper than most of the food you'll find on the strip!",

I save the cute games & doggie stickers they give with the meal for my grandson.   I got curious one night about its name and Wiki-ed it.

For the price you pay and for the amount of food you get is unbeatable.   Normally chicken fingers tends to be a little dry, but with Canes, no other chicken fingers compares! The house sauce just puts it over the map with their chicken fingers already freshly made with the right amount of juices. And you can't forget to get their famous sweet tea, it just goes great with the chicken fingers, fries, and bread! I always pack the sweet tea to go and drink it along the day. Talk about a great combo!  They have great employees who are always consistent about cleaning the tables after customers had left. Cashiers are always smiling! Love their service!

I've waited 15-20 minutes in the drive thru line in the past, so if you're late for class or work, don't come here if you see a lot of cars lined up thinking it'll go by fast. It probably won't.   Other than that, everything here is amazing and worth waiting on the drive thru line (if you've got the time). I usually get the 3 finger combo or the sandwich. Dip everything in their dipping sauce, trust me.  You can also get a discount if you show your UNLV student ID!",

Went with a couple of friends and we were out the door in no time (in a good way of course)  Food: Chicken strips are what they're know for, but I guess it wasn't as crispy as I'd like it to be! The batter felt a little soft for my liking but they do use real chicken. The sauce is to die for, a spicy chipotle type of feel! The fries are delicious, and it comes a nice toast of burnt cheese bread and sweet tea. No complaints here.  Price: I paid less than I believe $7 for my meal, such a steal!  Environment: A fast food feel like environment  Service: Friendly and patient cashiers and workers! They're always smiling! Also super quick too!  Check this place out! Good for quick and fast eats that's tasty and a great price too",

They pile a fat helping of fries along with some texas toast and coleslaw.  I say forget the slaw and switch out for two texas toasts!  Don't even get me started on the Cane sauce...if there's anyway to describe the Cane sauce, it's simple.  The Cane sauce is the truth...

(Not complaining I'm down for the extra food) so I gave them a call and they knew exactly who I was as soon as I called. I was directed to Matt who was the manager on duty and he was extremely nice. He told me I could come at my convince for the misunderstanding and he would take care of me for the inconvenience. I went in today and again great service. This time Mario (gm) helped me and again I didn't even need to explain myself. I said my name and they knew the situation. To conclude this trip, not only did we spend money here yesterday but we also spent money again today because of the great service. Keep up the good work. This is the best canes I have ever been too. Thank you. You have an amazing staff and amazing management!!!  I will be coming back for sure .",

Raising Cane's are one of the many businesses that Las Vegas have that the Bay Area or the entire state of California don't. Maybe one day that founder Todd Graves will work on expanding the franchise to California. Hopefully, the Bay Area will be first.   I was here and ordered the \"3-strip\" Combo. For $6.99, I get three battered boneless chicken breast strips, with a side of fries, spicy dipping sauce and a thick \"Texas-Style\" grilled toast. I usually get chicken strips from businesses like Popeye or KFC, but Raising Cane's version are a tad better than the other competitors. I also get a fountain soda (Coke) with my meal.   My lunch: <a href=\"http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/ZFyJ83LJkkO1dP82kzXKNg?select=oiFbSMhV9l4Uiz7DgTb52g\">yelp.com/biz_photos/ZFyJ...</a>  The meal wasn't too bad to jumpstart my visit in \"Hot\" Las Vegas.   As I was enjoying my lunch, I was admiring the picture of Snoopy embracing with his master Charlie Brown. \"How cute!\"  The picture: <a href=\"http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/ZFyJ83LJkkO1dP82kzXKNg?select=OwGMpqVXfe-ovM2tad-YPQ\">yelp.com/biz_photos/ZFyJ...</a>",

What can you get at Raising Cane's?  Chicken fingers, bread, fries... and not a whole lot else.  But Yelp didn't steer me wrong - these are good chicken fingers!  The breading was super crispy, though a little oily, and the inside was juicy and tender white meat chicken.  They're not small, so a few fingers is probably enough for most people, especially if you order sides.    We got four fingers plus the Texas toast, which was a thick-cut slice of white bread with a garlicky butter spread.  The flavor was good but the bread was sort of soggy and chewy.  The Cane's sauce is a smoky, BBQ, creamy sauce that's meant for the chicken, I guess, but was also tasty on the toast.  I'm not big on fries or coleslaw, so I didn't try them, but this still means I tried half of the menu.  That's sort of crazy when you consider that I only tried three things!  The interior closes pretty early, by my standards, and we were shooed off to the drive-thru by a stern gentleman in a crisp uniform and a beret.  The drive-thru had a long line and moved pretty slowly, though the staff were friendly enough.  I got a kick out of trying this place, but I'm not upset that it's a West Coast chain that I can't get at home.",

I love that there isn't a lot to choose from, like other fast food joints, because it means they're doing something right with just a limited menu!  Ordered the $8.29 Caniac combo, which comes with 6 chicken fingers, 1 Texas toast, fries, cole slaw, and a large drink, and that was even too much for my boyfriend and I to share. Maybe it's because we opted to double the fries instead of getting cole slaw. maybe it's because I drank too much of their delicious sweet tea. Maybe it was because I dipped the perfectly seasoned, lightly breaded chicken fingers in their delicious Cane's sauce. But whatever reason it was, we spent less than $10 for a meal and still had leftovers so I really can't complain.   Our wallets went home empty after gambling on the strip but our stomachs went home happy.",

I've been wanting to try for a while but I thought, \"how good can a place that only serves chicken fingers be?\"  I got SCHOOLED.  It can be *really* good.    They serve up juicy and fresh (not frozen) chicken tenders; Texas toast, which is the best side ever; crinkle cut french fries, which just hit the spot sometimes, you know?  I did think the french fry portion was a little modest, so-to-speak.  But I chose the 3-finger meal and was full afterwards.  The dipping sauce is the real deal - so good.  My husband raved about the crushed iced.  I was all, \"really?  The crushed ice, babe??\"  But I admit, there's just something about it lol.  I do think it's strange that lemonade is 10 cents extra but no biggie, it's good.    This location feels like it should be UNLV's student center lol.  Just has that college feel.  It's cool though.  I remember those days and would have been there almost every day!    If you haven't been here yet this place is going to surprise you with how simply good it is.  It will fill you and you will enjoy it, but don't take my word for it.  Ready.  Set.  GO!!",

Do not forget to order one extra of their special sauce. That is what makes this chicken even better! They are breaded lightly and never too much. Crispy but not too much. Just perfect! Dunk your fries in the sauce its better than ketchup and I love ketchup.  The sweet tea is awesome! Perfect match with your meal! Yum!",

I was later told by another customer who dines there regularly that Raising Cane is known for their Cajun dipping sauce. Meh. I prefer it on the chicken.

So as I was driving looking for something to eat.... low and behold... there's Canes. So excited and ready to order the whole menu  I proceed to the drive through. I ordered the Big Box with extra chicken and sauce and also two 3 box combos. I get to the windows and pay for my order. I was so excited to taste there food because it smelled so amazing, I didn't realize I left my drinks. I immediately turn around to go back. When I get to the speaker the lady comes on and ask how can she help. I explained to her that I previously ordered and items were missing. As I begin to tell her what was missing she tells me to proceed to the second window. Once I approach the window, Keeka ( the manager) ask me if I had an order. I explained to her that I was missing items. She cuts me off and tells me \" SHE ONLY HEARD SAUCE\" I asked her if she could let me explain and stop cutting me off while I was explaining. Rudely she says \" WELL IF THATS THE CASE I NEED TO SEE YOUR RECEIPTS\" I explained to her that wasn't an issue. She's hands me two room temperature drinks one of them wrong. I tell her there was three.... she said well I can't see that so I can't give you the other drink. When I asked if I could speak with the manager she said \" I am the fucking manager\" so I asked who her manager was and she began to yell the number at me.... I am completely and utterly devastated in regards to the service I received from her... especially as a manager. Her behavior was very ugly and distasteful. I am so sad that such a lovely establishment hires people who don't care about the customer. Although the food was amazing, I will never return to this company. I'm a single hard working mother who is barely making minimum wage. I believe in spending my money where it feels appreciated.   I'll just stick to Chik Fil",

Once we left this place, we noticed cops had already pulled over 2 vehicles at nearby locations.   I guess ghetto people like Raising Cane's also.

    "text": "Cane's would get a 5 star if they could keep the quality control to standard.  At best, the chicken is perfectly brined, with a breading so perfect you could call it tempura. It will slide off the chicken if you let it. Chicken is perfectly tender. The fries are have a crisp outside and a soft, delicious inside. The toast is beautiful, buttery, and garlicky.  At worst, and definitely more common, the chicken will be overcooked. The breading will infuse into the chicken and basically create an hard, inedible rock. Frequently only 40% of the finger will even be edible. The fries will be a soggy mess. The toast will have been pressed into the styrofoam lid and there will be melted styrofoam on it.   If you ask for the chicken to be remade and explain what is wrong, they will always look at you like you're insane, and will end up giving you another plate of garbage. If you say you want your money back they won't give it to you. Instead they'll try to give you a gift card.  Lastly, I have to mention how corny the music and decor of Cane's is. A bunch of movie posters are on the wall that all suck, and the music is frequently stuff that is even bad for radio music. They make the workers dress like a pre-diabetes Texan. Expect to see a Ferris Bueler poster, probably a Twilight poster, some Harry Potter action and then the Hangover. Expect to hear some weird ass Britney Spears music you'd hoped you would forget.  TL;DR: If the quality control could stay up, they would get a 5/5, regardless of the music and decor.",

    "text": "This review is for 4.5 stars.  I was really wanting chicken fingers (hadn't had them in a long time). But I didn't want heavily breaded ones (I hate that). Enter Raising Cane's. Since we were going to Target, the Dollar Tree, and K & K, we went here.   It was packed inside- should've known, the parking lot was full. Man, was it super loud. Our little one had just fallen asleep. Not for long! The music is pretty loud to begin with. There is a very loud yell for your name to pick up your food- even the girl next to him was like \"Dang!\" One of the few booths available were right up front, so we were stuck there. The remaining seats were stools in front of the window, opposite the cashier counter. So, the crowd, music, and the shout-out for your name made this a loud environment. Note to self: only bring the baby when he is awake.   The food came out fast. Free Refills on soda. I love that the fingers are not full of breading. The sauce is really good (kinda like ranch mixed with thousand island dressing). I don't normally like cafeteria style french fries, but the crispy ones were tasty. Pump-style ketchup (like Wendy's and Arby's) at the counter next to the soda fountain. I must've been hungry (or anticipating, or BOTH) because I ate most of (OK, almost all of it- you caught me) my 3 finger combo meal- three fingers, sauce, texas toast, fries and drink. My husband got the Box lunch combo- mine plus another finger and coleslaw.   Clean place. The clerk was going around collecting customers' garbage. Drive-Thru window. Tailgate Packages available- perfect for large parties and events.",

    "text": "Eating the Buffet of Buffets for the past 24 hours was exhausting...so we decided to go somewhere near UNLV. (Literally right across from Target).   While driving by this fast food restaurant, I noticed that there was a drive-thru as well as a sitting area inside. Of course I decided to go inside to check it out. The interior was quite interesting. There were Halloween decorations and awesome ceiling fans that look like an airplane wing fan.   We were greeted promptly and ordered the 3 piece combo and the caniac combo. The 3 piece combo came with their special sauce that tasted like thousand island (disappointed that the employee lied to me when I specified if there was thousand island and she denied it and said that they could not tell me what was placed into this sauce...So...Yes, I had an allergic reaction to this...) Thank you lady...Anyways, this also came with Texas bread, fries and a drink. The Texas bread was excellent because it tasted like a Hawaiian bread that was soft and not too buttery. The fries wasn't all that great, but it was ok though. The sweet tea was not as good as Popeyes...it was kind of bitter. Maybe they accidentally mixed the unsweetened iced tea with the sweet tea?   The caniac combo meal came with the same items stated above as well as coleslaw. The coleslaw was a bit drenched in the sauce; however, the cabbage wasn't soggy and limp but crispy still. I enjoyed eating this side. Lastly, I didn't mentioned how the chicken tenders tasted yet because I wanted to save it for last! OMG! THE BEST CHICKEN TENDERS that I have ever eaten so far. Wow! The seasoning was just perfect and the batter was nice and light. The chicken breast was fresh and not frozen because it was all white meat and not those dark looking frozen meats. The chicken was so juicy and tender...I kind of wished that I got the party size now...  All I have to say is that Yelpers...This is a restaurant that you must try in Las Vegas! Something quick and simple for you late Vegas arrivals or even locals.   Note: You have to ask for the key to use the restroom.",

So, I decided to swing by here to grab a small lunch on the way to the airport.  Unfortunately, none of their meal deals look like a \"small lunch.\" Especially one that could be eaten on the move.  I did go inside to check out the menu at my own pace, and the store was a 9 on a scale of 1-10 in terms of the madhouse factor. All tables packed, kids screaming with no parental control and just an atmosphere I want nothing to do with on this planet.  Even an attempt to wash my hands upon entering the restaurant was not successful as both restroom doors were locked and apparently require a key from the front counter. Honestly, this is the first time I have ever experienced this at a fast food restaurant anywhere. Gas station off a highway, yes? Fast food restaurant in the city limits, nope.  While there was chaos from the customers (except the guys who work at UNLV athletics who were behind me in line), the employees were calm, friendly and got me in and out the door fast!  My \"small lunch\" comprised of two chicken fingers, a piece of Texas toast and the sauce. This was the first time I'd ever seen a dipping sauce on the menu at an additional price, but it obviously is one of their signature items and it had a zesty flavor. The Texas toast was also tasty, but I found the chicken fingers kind of average in size and flavor on their own without the sauce.  My fast food needs going forward will likely be satisfied by other options, and I certainly will not be walking into this particular Raising Cane's again for decent chicken and that locked bathroom.",

The first and only time I've had Cane's was 2011 in New Orleans and ever since then I've been trying to have it again... Their sauce is delicious. A Vegas friend mentioned to me that they have a few locations here, which surprised me because I thought they were mostly in Louisiana and the south.  I got the 6 pc combo box and it was way too much food, the 4 pc would have been better. Comes with coleslaw, Texas toast, the chicken fingers, and a huge drink, I ordered sweet tea. Their sweet tea is very good - not super sweet but not like regular tea either.  I wish I could have brought some of the sauce home but apparently it's mayo-based and needs to be refrigerated. I did find a copycat recipe online though so I may try that sometime.",

After have some drinks at Bound, I was craving some late night fried chicken so I was debating between Blue Ribbon or Raising Cane's, which I really couldn't go wrong with either.  I'm glad I went to Raising Cane's though since they had a drive-thru.  And since it's been a year since I last visited, I was definitely due for some epic fried chicken strips.  Box Combo To-go -- <a href=\"/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2Fbit.ly%2F2JqgwWM&s=3c07f17fff31137bb2452153ecd1bd218e9196d35c356699c0b523610fb8945c\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">bit.ly/2JqgwWM</a> Four Chicken Fingers, Crinkle-Cut Fries, One Cane's Sauce, Texas Toast, Coleslaw, Regular Drink. Same combo I had last time I was here, and it's just as awesome getting it to-go and eating it in my hotel room.  Strips were tasty and not dry and gotta love the crinkle cut fries and Texas toast.  Whether you're dining in or ordering drive-thru, Raising Cane's will be a sure thing any time you go.  I'm happy to add them to my late night dining options.",

The fiance and I weren't too hungry some we shared a box with 3 strips/tenders, fries, and small coleslaw. The coleslaw was nothing to rave about, the fries were decently satisfying, and moving to the chicken--well that's the money maker. The tenders were juicy, well seasons, and not too greasy. I had my share and didn't feel overwhelmingly gross afterwards which is always a good sign when eating heavy fried foods.    If you're looking for a quick, cheap meal in LV and don't mind it not being the healthier option (common, why would you get fried chicken for that reason anyhow), then raising cane will resolve that hunger for y'all.",

    "text": "The three components of delicious chicken are (1) the quality of the bird; (2) the texture of the breading; and (3) the sauce. How does Cane's rank across all 3 categories?  First, the chicken tenders are the thickest and most tender I've ever come across. I am ashamed to admit that I have been suspicious of genetic modification and have done research looking for evidence of such modification, but to no avail. Furthermore, the tenders are extremely juicy, so much so that one will assuredly make multiple visits to the napkin dispenser to acquire more napkins, each time seeking more and more napkins in attempt to reign in the juice's flow. All in all, the quality of the bird is vastly superior to any that I have come across in a restaurant chain, and is even arguably superior to home-style cooking.   Second, the breading is delicious. It is delightfully fluffy, and it's oil content is nowhere near excessive. It does not overpower the flavor of the white meat, but complements it with a satisfying saltiness and crunch. It's seasoning is perfectly harmonious with the crinkle-cut fries (which have a cult following of their own). Thus, the breading of Cane's chicken fingers will cause a haze to come over your mind, leaving the memory of Chick-Fil-A's chicken lost in the mist of antiquity.   Finally, perhaps the best part of all: Cane's dipping sauce. Hardly comparable to any other sauce in the industry and vastly superior to that of the famed \"Chick-Fil-A sauce,\" the Cane's sauce scientists have created perfect equilibrium between tangy, spicy, salty, and sweet. Legions of bloggers, chefs, cooks, and other prominent online presences have attempted to discover the Cane's sauce secret recipe in order to re-create it, but all have failed. Ultimately, the sauce is sublime.   Might I add that each order comes with a thick slice of Texas toast, which, when dipped into Cane's sauce, will leave you an addict, lusting after the blend of flavors and doughy goodness that only Cane's Texas toast can provide.  If you've tried it, then you'll agree that this review failed miserably to adequately describe the superiority and greatness of Cane's chicken.",

    "text": "One of the most popular Chicken places in America, I was bummed I didn't try it when I was in Texas in March, was not going to miss a second chance in Vegas.  ======== LOCATION ========  This one was close to the Vegas strip, we did drive thru.  ============ THE CHICKENZ ============  ~ RAISING CANES DIPPING SAUCE - Their sauce was amazing! It's a Mayo based sauce with a little zing and flavor to it. The best thing about the place. It's in the dipping sauce Hall of Fame. (5/5)  ~ TEXAS TOAST - It was absolutely delicious, full of flavor. Delicious by itself, great with the sauce bursting with flavor. It had the perfect texture too... soft on the inside, a little crispy on the exterior. Dip in sauce or eat by itself. (5/5)  ~ CHICKEN FINGERS - It was okay. Nothing more, nothing less. Honestly it was too crispy in parts, not thick and juicy enough like succulent chicken tenders/fingers elsewhere. Additionally the taste of the chicken was not as good as Popeyes or Church's Chicken.  (3/5)  ~ COLESLAW - It wasn't very good. Very basic. Kentucky Fried Chicken has thee best coleslaw and this isn't anywhere near that realm. (2/5)  ~ FRIES - They were fries. They were crinkle cut and not that good. (2/5)  ============== FINAL THOUGHTS ==============  All in all it definitely did not live up to the hype. I don't know what crack some of y'all are smoking but there's better chicken tender/finger options out there.  The menu is similar to In-N-Out, only 4-5 options, very basic and simple menu.  I've had better chicken but would go back for that toast and Cane sauce.  I wouldn't buy \"the Box\" specials... I'd just buy the sauce and toast and maybe a tender or two a'La Carte.  Last piece of advice, buy 2 Texas Toasts, a couple Tenders and make a DIY sandwich with the toast, chicken, sauce and coleslaw. It's pretty decent.  ALL IN ALL, IT DIDN'T LIVE UP TO THE HYPE.",

I ordered a combo with three strips, fries and a lemonade, my companion had small sides. $14 later, I am ready to receive the flavor!   Well.....womp womp woooomp. I tried my first piece without dipping sauce, because.....IMO good chicken doesn't need a sauce to make it tasty. It can be seasoned really well and shine on its own without extras. But anyway, I digress and that's another post for another day.   I will say, the chicken is decent. It isn't dry or overcooked, but it is kinda plain on its own. So, is it the sauce that makes everyone go crazy when they talk about this place? Hmmmm.   I try their house recipe (Tabasco, Mayo, Lawry's, a dash of chipotle, paprika and lemon?) and it tastes a lot better. They make the honey mustard sauce from scratch, so they say. It was okay, but I prefer the house sauce.   The fries taste like Ore-Ida crinkle cuts, without salt or fry seasoning. They were sad little French fries. Sad sad sad. The coleslaw was okay, reminiscent of KFC.   Final verdict: If Raising Cane's and Chick-fil-A were in a knock down, heavyweight championship fight, CFA still wins.",

    "text": "Decided to make the most out of not bringing lunch by stopping by Cane's. I've heard a lot of good things about it, and one location just opened up in the LA area. I was happy to see the many locations around Vegas and even though it's not the healthiest meal option ... you have to try everything once, right?   This location of Raising Cane's is on Flamingo and Maryland. It's located by UNLV and lots of shops, so it can get quite packed during lunch hour. While the parking lot had a ton of spaces (thank you Vegas!), the indoor dining room was full.   Menu was really simple - there are a few combo choices or you can order items a la carte. Most of the combos include chicken fingers, crinkle-cut fries, Cane's sauce, and a drink. One might offer Texas toast, the other a Kaiser roll, or coleslaw. You're able to order more or less of an item separately. Items aren't too pricey and you get filled up with all the food. Since it is fast food, everything was boxed up and ready to go within minutes.   Three freshly fried chicken tenders ... they were delicious, but I definitely hated myself after consuming the food! Super crispy on the outside but tender meat on the inside. Not too much flavor to the chicken though, so I had to dunk the pieces in the Cane's sauce. Unfortunately I didn't have enough sauce for the chicken and tenders, which was disheartening. The French fries were unique - most places don't offer crinkle cut anymore! Soft on the inside but crispy on the outside - they threw in a good amount, too. Texas toast was nothing special - guess I could have eaten chicken and the sauce with the bread, but I didn't think of that until after I finished. And of course, finished the meal with some sweet tea.   tl;dr - A good place to eat if you're craving something unhealthy. Workers are friendly and nice, and food comes out fairly quickly. This location is super busy, but there are a ton around Vegas.",

So when we were leaving Thomas & Mack Center after the Lakers' Summer League squad beat up 76'ers, we were looking for anything filling. Enter Raising Cane's!  This chicken finger shop was fantastic! For a very cheap price (3-6 pieces, ranging from $7-11), you'll get some incredibly crunchy and juicy chicken tenders, Raising Cane sauce (this sauce is to their chicken fingers as In N Out's spread is to their burgers), some decadently crispy fries with a satisfying crunch, a buttery cheese-toast, and a drink of your choice!  Keep in mind that after you're done with your meal, you'll slowly feel the dread of the calories washing over your arteries. It's not even remotely good for your health, but it's nutritious for the soul!",

Lol , the chicken here is the bomb , always fresh and cooked to order , not overly breaded and consistently juicy !! The fries are best when hot and salty ( eat them first !) , the coleslaw is pretty fresh , but for some reason doesn't taste good the next day ??? & I know I'm going to piss some people off , but the Texas toast is just ok and if on a diet not worth the calorie count/carbs !! And being that i'm a saucy type person , ( they never give you enough,& have to buy extras ) I recommend one sauce for every two tenders !! And pay a little extra for the lemonade it's worth it , and as my sister always does she takes a couple gallons home with her !!",

They offer toast, fries, cole slaw, and their special Cane's sauce that is so addicting that I always buy an extra container to dunk everything in it.  You can customize your order by switching out different sides.  I always end up substitute my french fries for an extra piece of toast because its oh so good.    Chicken strips have a nice crunchy coating and is moist and hot on the inside.    Ask for your toast to be buttered both sides, you won't regret it!

Clean, good flow and organization. At 4:30 on Friday, it was 75% full.  A great testament either to fast food or good quality.  b.  Service - I really like the consistency and the good service from the people cooking, the cashier, the people prepping your order. High quality in my book.  c.  Food - They do a few things and do it very well. Fresh made chicken tenders, fries, texas toast.  I find the tenders to be awesome for a breaded fried product that I normally stay away from.  The toast is great. The fries, no go.  d.  Price - Can be reasonable. I spent 85.00 ordering a tray of 75 chicken tenders, served in 3 tin foil trays and 1 tray with fries. Very reasonable and a lot for the money.  e.  GK says, this place is NOT bad at all. Highest level of fast food I have tried besides In and Out.",

Their menu is very simple and consists of chicken fingers and chicken sandwiches, their selections are very similar to one another but just different sizes. Chicken strips was perfectly battered, not too salty, crispy, cooked just right, and you get them freshly made.

Maybe it was hyped up too much, so our expectations were too high...I found the chicken to lack flavor and really be no better than any other place serving chicken fingers. The sauce was good and that definitely gave the chicken the flavor it was missing. The texas toast is okay, the sweet tea is really good.. Loved it...

People at the counter just talking while all the empty tables were dirty or had garbage on table. Too bad, I hope this one gets an overhaul soon because I will just keep taking tourists to the store on LVB by the outlet or to In-N-Out instead.",

If you love, or even like chicken strips, then Raising Cane's is the place to eat. The chicken strips are crispy, juicy, and pretty much perfect. The fries could use a little work and it's best to eat them while they are fresh. If you have a little ride home, you may want to poke holes in the box because your fries will retain too much moisture and they won't be that good. However, the sauce is the problem solver. I use the sauce on my fries as well as my chicken strips. And my beverage of choice is always the sweet tea...so refreshing =)",

Checked out Raising Cane's one night, came in around 10:55pm.  We ordered our food to eat for here but the cashier asked the manager if we could still eat there since they close at 11pm but  the manager said we could stay as long as we wanted, pretty much since their drive thru is open till 1am.  Very cool dude, appreciated the great attitude and customer service from a fast food joint for once.  Actually, they cashier and the other staff we encountered were way friendly and cool.  The Chicken Fingers were alright, can't say they were outstanding or anything.  The CF from KFC probably have a little more flavor but that's just me.  The CF came with one kind of sauce.  Couldn't figure out exactly what the flavor was, it was kind of like a cross between Thousand Island dressing and the sauce from Chick-Fil-A.  It was good but, I would've rather had Honey Mustard or BBQ.  The rest of the food...the Fries, Texas Toast and Slaw were pretty basic.  I did however love how they offered Sweet Tea in their beverage selection.",

The food is always consistent and fresh.  The good part is you can always do substitutions. My sister doesn't like their Texas toast (a preference) so she ask for substitution of extra fries which they were willing to substitute.   Always ask for extra sauce as well! One of the reasons for coming back to Raising Cane's is for their sauce.  As for the Sweet tea, it is a little too sweet even with an entire cut of ice. So what I have found is that doing half no-sugar sweet tea + half sweet tea is the perfect sweetness for my taste.",

    "text": "Less fries more chicken please.  Less bread more chicken please.  Less ice-tea more chicken please.  Look I get that people rave about Raising Cane's, but to be perfectly honest I only believe it to be an okay establishment. It does have its place in many people's chicken strip loving hearts, but my experiences here have been lackluster.  The last time I went I got the 3-strip combo, which comes with 3 chicken strips, french fries, and of course, their tasty bread. I got a Dr. Pepper, because I don't like their sweet iced tea (ohmahgawd! I know.) It's too sweet. It's nothing like my Mother's Texas Tea, and well, she makes it better so she wins, the end.  As for the combo meal, I felt like I had more carbs than anything else. Were the fries good? Ya. Was the bread good? Ya. Were the chicken strips good? Ya. But I felt like I should have had more chicken strips than anything else, and my chicken strips were very much on the small side. If you're going to base your establishment on chicken strips, shouldn't those suckers be BIG, juicy, and plentiful?!   I also made the mistake of taking an order to go. Don't do it. The take-away box makes everything soggy, especially the fries and bread. Best to just eat there, unless you live less than 5 minutes away.",

When we came in there was a line & the place was packed! But service is very quick & we had our food almost right after we ordered.   Very fresh chicken, so tasty ! Their website says everything is made to order & there's no heat lamps. Texas toast is to die for ommgg I could eat that all day ! There's also their raising canes sauce which is what I think really makes people love their food but I'm a very picky sauce eater so I didn't try it. While their chicken is so good to me it is just chicken so it wasn't like a WOW when I ate it which is why I think the sauce is what really makes it. Overall it was good & inexpensive & I can see why people come here all the time.",

We were lucky to find a table that was available since it seemed like some little league team was there at the time and took up most of the tables. The place was pretty clean and I saw them sweeping up a lot.  Service was OK. I didn't know anything about the place before ordering so when I asked if they had any BBQ sauce the cashier kinda just laughed at me. I mean OK sorry if that was obvious but, I really didn't know... Besides that she was nice enough, and I didn't have any interaction with the other staff.  The food was also just.. OK. I love chicken tenders and I was really excited to come here because I had heard such good things. The chicken itself was good and juicy, but it really didn't have too much flavor in either the meat or the breading. It kind of felt like I was just eating a good piece of chicken coated in bland panko. Some seasoning would really help the chicken, as well as the fries. I like the crinkle cut just fine, but when I put some seasoning salt on the leftovers myself after we had left, they were 10x better. I can't comment on the coleslaw since I'm not a fan and don't order it. But I can say that the Texas Toast is GREAT. I love the buttery-garlic-y not-too-crunchy outside that hides the soft and fluffy inside. I'd continue going back just for the toast.  Overall, even thought I was pretty underwhelmed, I think this place is OK. I came back on my most recent Vegas trip, because it's cheap for the portion and for its relative proximity to the strip (by car). My opinion on the food is the same, but that may be a good thing since I got it to-go most recently. I wouldn't say I come here to have a great meal (exception being the amazing toast), but it's something decent to hold you over until dinner comes along.",

It sucks that in Cali the closest Cane's we have is in Costa Mesa, in the middle of nowhere (LA is far from there lol) I usually get the Caniac Combo. You will NEVER go wrong with that combo and a large freshly made lemonade with a slice of lemon added in! The sauce of theirs, it's something else! It gets me all the time, and you can't help but love how it combines well with the chicken and the fries. That bread is delectful and always well done. Always double up on it, as I love the taste as it hits my taste buds. We need some Canes in Los Angeles proper. Make it happen folks!!!",

Let's start with the chicken; it is really, really good.  What is better than the chicken; the bread!  Anyone who has eaten here knows the bread is killer.  The sauce, yep, don't forget about the sauce it to is killer, and will draw you back for more.   The customer service is outstanding. The young kid with the \"poofy\" ( I mean that in a nice way) who brings out the food is a sweetie.  The counter girls are also very efficient, even though it is so busy in there.   Now, the chaos!  The patrons!  This place is super busy during mid day and there were a group of rude, loud, obnoxious girls in BIKINIS eating while all the mothers inside were trying to distract their kids from noticing.  One of these scantly clad divas came up to my table while my son was alone, and just grabbed a chair.  No asking, no excuse me, no nothing.  Fortunately, for me and her I only needed 3 and not 4 chairs. I didn't want to have to embarrass my kids with a scene.   I have since gone to the Henderson location and it is just as lovely minus the Divas!  Love Raising Cane's.....",

I'm really jealous of Vegas residents for having this restaurant lol, but maybe it's a good thing we don't have it in Cali...I would eat this once a week!

I came here for an early dinner with my boyfriend after spending the day at the strip. This location is the closest to my house and the strip and my craving was unreal so we decided to satisfy my hunger.  We are inside and the staff we super friendly, attentive, and fast. The food came out fresh and hot and it was my first time ordering the lemonade and it was so tasty and refreshing. Overall I have no complaints except for I wish they opened more locations; especially one down the street from my house   --------------  Let me start off by saying I am a loyal Raising Canes fan. I literally eat this during every lunch break since I've discovered it (I am not from LV and never heard of Raising Canes)  If I were to rate the food it would be 5/5 no doubt, this is my favorite fast food joint.  However, when visiting this East Flamingo location I was very disappointed and left upset by the rude \"customer service\" I had in the drive thru. I always go to the one near my workplace on St Rose and they treat their guest excellently. Well during my drive thru visit the lady helping us out had us repeat our order several times and then when we corrected her she would say \"that's what I said\" when she didn't... When we asked to substitute something she said \"no you can't do it\" in a snarky tone.. might I add that I've done it before at the other location. Then at the window she just came across as snobby and not wanting to assist us.  Never going back to this location.",

Raising Cane's is a must when you're heading in or out of Vegas..or both! Not only do you get pretty large portions, but the food is divine. The chicken tenders, the bread, the coleslaw...and the sauce. Everything perfectly compliments everything else on the plate. There is no one item that is not made into perfection. After you finish that delicious, greasy meal, you can wash it down with some nice sweet iced tea. This will definitely revive you after your crazy Vegas trip.   The one thing that I had a bit of trouble with was the price of the sauce. They give you a certain amount of sauce per order...but once you try the sauce, you know why you'll need more. I seriously drench everything in that sauce. But if you want more, they're going to charge you. Unfortunate, but understandable.   tl;dr - I would drive to Vegas just to get Raising Cane's...that's how good it is.",

(Side note: do an Arnold Palmer and mix it with their equally tasty sweet tea)  I usually get the 3 tender combo, a perfect amount to satisfy my hunger. Along with the tenders, one of the highlights of the combo is the buttered and toasted to perfection Texas toast.

Despite the countless dining options in Las Vegas, this was always on the 'go-to' list.  I think of Raising Cane's as the chicken finger version of In-n-Out Burger.  They have a simple menu, clean restaurants and friendly staff.  I have never had a bad experience at any Raising Cane's and all of the employees seem genuinely happy to work there.  The fact that they have an adorable dog as their mascot (Cane) doesn't hurt either.  The chicken fingers are good, especially with their signature sauce.  Cole slaw and fries are also winners as is their Texas toast (LOVE their Texas toast!).  There really is something to be said about no over-diversifying your menu.  Keep it simple and so it right.  Cane's also involves themselves with local charities, and currently have a promotion during the holidays where you can buy a little stuffed Cane in a \"Buddy the Elf\" costume and proceeds will go to charity.  If you've never been here, you must go.  It's as simple as that.",

Very bland. The dipping sauce none of us liked. Cole slaw was average. Probably won't try again. Ps kids enjoy ranch on their strips, they don't carry ranch.",

    "text": "I heard this place was really popular in Boston.  And it's my friend's favorite chicken joint.  I personally thought it was okay, nothing great or mouth watering.  It wasn't bad though.  My friend and I each ordered the 3 chicken finger meal, which included the 3 chicken fingers, a lot of fries, their special sauce, and a drink.  If you want a free drink and it's your first time hitting up this place, check in on FourSquare so you can get a free drink if you order a meal; I believe it was lemonade.  I checked in after the fact and found out what I could have gotten.  What was lame was I couldn't save the deal for later like how Yelp allows us to do so.  Just an FYI...  Oh yea, they have the staff call out your name very loud to let you know that your order is ready.  If you don't come for it, they'll go looking for you in the restaurant, which I liked.  I didn't like how the tables weren't clean.  A good # of tables had crumbs of chicken and stuff on it.  They should have the staff going around more often to clean them, especially since this location was pretty busy.",

In-N-out is no longer alone. I had the three finger combo. The chicken was all white meat lightly breaded and fried crisp. It was not greasy, just crisp on the outside and juicy inside. I enjoyed the peppery-ness of the sauce, but I was missing smoke flavor. I suppose I'm too used to BBQ sauce. Still, tasty, however.  Even the sides were good. The crinkle fries were crisp and fluffy in the center, just the way I like them. The Texas toast was fresh and light, with a brush of butter and garlic. Yum.",

I mean, a fast-food restaurant that only serves chicken fingers?! How good could that be?! Let me tell you: pretty darn good!  I always get the Box Combo, which comes with 4 chicken strips, coleslaw, fries, texas toast, 1 cane's sauce and a medium drink. It's just the right amount of food for my healthy appetite.  Chicken fingers: They're always tender, and never dry. The outside of the chicken could be a little crunchier, but at least it doesn't have any of the hard, chewy chunks that you sometimes find in chicken fingers (gross, I know, lol).   Coleslaw: It's very reminiscent of KFC's version, only creamier and fresher.  Fries: These remind me of a thinner version of Ore-Ida's crinkle french fries - they're pretty mediocre but perfectly salted, for me.  Texas toast: Thick texas toast, grilled with a slight buttery-garlic flavor.  Cane's sauce: I love their sauce! It's a mayo-ketchup based sauce with tons of black pepper, which I feel compliments the chicken fingers nicely... and the fries... and... hell, just dump it on everything!  Service is always top notch! They're very accommodating if you want to switch out the coleslaw in your combo to add another piece of toast, so you can make yourself a big chicken finger sandwich. And I love the fact that everything is made cooked-to-order and not sitting under heat lamps.",

After one experience with Raising Cane's I realize that I've been living in Las  Vegas for about a month now and only discovered this place just now?  Anyway I had \"the box combo\" seeing as how it was the most popular choice and I guess I can see why. To briefly sum it up I really liked the chicken fingers which are amazing when had with the Cane sauce. The fries were pretty good and there weren't overly salty or greasy compared to others that I've had. Coleslaw I didn't care too much for and lastly the Texas Toast was a nice touch to the meal.",

    "text": "For those that read my last review on Rio buffet knows that I was in Vegas last week.  So while driving around town in Vegas I've passed by and noticed a huge \"Cane's\" sign.  Not sure what that was so the moment I got back to the room, I've decided to look them up.  There I realized that it's not \"Cane's\", but Raising Cane's Chicken Finger Restaurant.  So being a curious foodie that I am... I had to make a point to check them out before I'm heading back to good ol LA.  My initial reaction... chicken finger restaurant?  What the?  I really got to go see it.  Upon my arrival (10:50am), There were like 3 people getting some food in front of me.  The location is right on Flamingo and near Maryland Pkwy which you can't miss, and it's super clean!  (Sorry for the sidetrack but I'll focus now!)  So the interior was squeaky clean to me!  Perhaps it was early in the day but it definitely smelled really good, super clean, very pleasant.  So now I'm approaching the counter.  The clerk was extremely courteous!  Very nice touch because I'm a sucker for service!  I told her that this is my first time here and that I'm from LA, and she gave me a good quick run down on the business history and what they offer...  I'm sure they were part of the procedure but nevertheless it's interesting to hear.  Very simply menu... it's pretty much 3 pcs of chicken with toast, fries, cole slaw and sauce, the 4 pcs version, or the Caniac (6 pcs version which was their large combo)  Having people in my party I had to get the 6 pcs with 2 sauces...  Here's how the food tasted...  Chicken finger was great!  Solid chicken pieces, freshly prepared, but to me it was slightly small that I would have liked for the price (which I'll get to in a minute).  Crinkle fries were pretty good... (I don't complain much about fries as they are my favorite, but I don't like steak fries too much because it's like eating an entire potato)  Cane sauce was decent, it was pretty much a hybrid of mayo based sauce mixed in with chili of some sort.. not too salty which is great with a little kick to it.  Texas toast was a thick piece of loaf with very little garlic butter on it, and the cole slaw was a cole slaw... nothing out of the ordinary and mediocre at it's best.  It also came with a drink though... (They got southern sweet tea which was pretty sweet!  LOL!)   The total of my meal came out be just under $9... it's little steep for me but the experience was very positive.  Again the chicken tender pieces could of been either bigger, or they could have substituted for more pieces considering that we are paying $9 bucks, but I have to say the quality of the chicken was very good and will definitely visit them again in the near future when I go back to Vegas.  So the history was about a guy writing a business plan on opening a chicken finger only restaurant, but was shot down by his professors, countless bankers, and eventually, worked hard a a day job and saved enough money so he can make his dream come True... Very inspiring if you ask me!  So maybe this review may not be as funny as others, but do remember that as long as you put your heart in doing what you love to do, work hard and not give up, you will eventually be rewarded!",

It's not exactly a sandwich, although they do have sandwiches.. It's about the tender chicken tenders! And what makes them unique is their sauce, which apparently is the boss. Also they have sweet Texas toast and sweet yummy-tea to top it all off.   This specific location was pretty sweet itself. It was my first time at this location and I was duper craving it. I decided to take drive thru cus I have this thing about going in restaurants by myself (it's not a problem, it's jus personal). Anyway, the wait was a little long.

First off, I'm not a real big fan of fried chicken (at least if the fried chicken in discussion is KFC, Popeye's & the like).  I am a real big fan of toast, specifically texas toast & garlic toast.

Moving on though, I love you Raising Cane's.  I love your toast (swap the coleslaw for an extra slice!), I love your chicken (strips!), I love your sauce (one extra please!), I love your iced tea (jug to go please!) and I love your service (always extra, super duper nice!).  Other nice perks:  PLENTY of parking.  next to a cupcake shop (which I've never tried, because I'm so full, but always swear I will the next time), drive-thru (a rarity for chicken spots), next to a Walmart (super convenient), fast service, clean bathrooms, clean eating area, funky decor.  Oh, and all of this at a fantastically reasonable price.",

    "text": "I would love to see some side options happen here.  Like some mac n cheese, sweet corn or corn bread. Ya know? To be quite frank, the coleslaw sucks!  But other than that, the combination of fried chicken strips, Texas toast, fries, and Cane's sauce is a perfect and affordable lunch or dinner option.  The chicken is always hot and juicy. The Texas toast is a carb-o-holics new obsession.  I always switch between the 3 finger combo: 3 chicken fingers, fries, & texas toast  OR Box combo: 4 chicken fingers, texas toast, slaw, & fries Just all depending on how hungry I am.",

So if your into the hipster, i'm confused about life, struggling college kid scene then this place makes for some good people watching. The staff was great, when a group exited the quickly cleaned up the tables and went back to work. The register people actually asked for my ID which I appreciated. Besides the sauce and great service, they have the best sweet tea around.",

The Texas toast is amazing, I always end up stealing my husband's toast from his order.  When I moved to Vegas from San Diego, I was sad at leaving Chic-Fil-A behind.  No longer does I haz a sad.  ;)  Staff are friendly, cheerful and HELPFUL.  Place is always immaculate, and there's always at least one person in the lobby area busing tables and wiping things down.  Sweet Tea - don't pass it up, it's awesome.  And to the one critical review I see below, may I say that if scads of people are saying it's great, and YOU happen to not agree... well perhaps it's YOUR perception that's off?  You mentioned being there late at night - perhaps your perceptions were \"chemically altered\"?  :)  Anyway - amazing, amazing, and terrific.  Don't miss it!  :D",

Their chicken strips were better than other chicken places I've been to. The cane sauce was definitely as describe by my friends, crack. It was definitely good. Hard to describe what it tasted like but it was addicting. The drive through service was great. The person working the drive thru had a great sense of humor and was very friendly. See you soon Raising Canes! Well definitely be back.",

    "text": "I've heard a lot about this place and the reviews were stellar so on my last trip to Vegas I decided to give them a shot. For fast food it is good, but there are a million bars and restaurants that have better chicken fingers.   I will say that the chicken itself was very moist, tender and juicy. They get credit (and the 3rd star) for that. Unfortunately the breading was very bland and tasteless and the sauce was only okay.  Be prepared, the ONLY thing this place sells is chicken fingers and a chicken sandwich made from chicken fingers. So if you are eating with someone who might want a burger or something else you will need to go elsewhere.  I was quite disappointed that they didn't appear to have a selection of sauces. I would have preferred a good BBQ sauce to their Canes Sauce, but considering the lack of options on their menu I guess their business plan is to tell people what to eat rather than let them decide what they want for themselves.  Again, not bad I guess for fast food, definitely better than the chicken strips at Burger King or Jack-in-the-Box (not that the bar there is set that high) but if you really want good chicken fingers you can do much better.",
