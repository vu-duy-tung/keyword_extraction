Otherwise, group A is 1,85 (20 varieties), group B is 2.50 (19 varieties) and Group C is $3.75 (2 varieties). The group A items are the standard dim sum items. Good enough. You MUST try the home made sweet toufu. Its a dessert and the toufu is so smooth. I am going back tomorrow. They serve Dim sum from 10.30 to 3pm. Specials are for all days except holidays.",

She brought 2 tea cups, which by the way, one was for me the other person with me is my 3 year old son. Does he drink hot tea, I think not. There must be something to it.   I keep wanting to get the satay hot sauce, and asked several ladies pushing the carts, they keep telling me \" ask the waitress.\" I haven't seen a waitress pass for any request. when I finally raised my voice to get the attention of a waitress, she said we only have 1 type of hot sauce.  NOT REAL AUTHENTIC dim sum, if they do not have the satay hot sauce.   The fried shrimp balls was OK, a bit dry. The steam rice noodle with beef on the inside, was weird. Noodles too chewy, and the beef seems like it was from some kind of beef paste, (its and Asian thing)   I did like the siu-mai though, it was good. seems like it was steam with little fish eggs on top.   I got my check, they actually charge $.50 for tea for each person. That was why the waitress keep wanting me to say yes for tea. Forget the $ amount, it's the principles of the matter.   So I will keep to my usual favorite place Cathay House, in china town for Dim Sum. Good food, good service.",

    "text": "Before spending some time at the Miracle Miles Shops, I decided to take my parents and bf out to lunch. Since I owed my dad a present from Father's Day, I let him decide on where he wanted to eat and we ended up here. We've been here numerous times before and it's how my dad developed an addiction to their chicken feet. Normally, on Tuesdays and Wednesdays it gets packed due to a lot of older Chinese folks dining here on those days( I was told those are their fave days off). But to my surprise, this place had plenty of seats available. We were seated promptly and the dim sum carts started coming by quickly. I ordered my folks some of their favorites:  Shumais- before becoming a pescetarian, these were one of my favorites. From what the folks and the bf said, it's still 'the same' and its still 'good'. Pork buns- ok wtf I loved these so much that I accidentally took a bite out of one! Then I felt sick...NOT because it was bad it's bc I am not used to eating meat anymore. But from that small bite, it was still yummy! And everyone agreed. Shrimp balls on a stick?- ok these were alright. Used to be better and the lady forgot the mayo. And what's up w/ the sugar cane..they should've left it out. Beef balls- these are the bf 's fave...he said it was still 'good' Chicken feet- i didn't have to ask my dad how it tasted. He devoured it in 2 seconds and had pieces of chicken skin hanging on his mustache..you decide. Shrimp w/ crispy skin- ok I apologize for not knowing what the food is called in Chinese..anyway these are awesome. Shrimp shumais- I love Tofu dessert- Warm,not too sweet, and good! Coconut bun- Eh..it's alright. Mixed seafood shumais- Good flavor a must have.  The food overall is good. The service has improved a lot(then again it wasn't busy so it might change). The only thing I don't love here is that prices seem to change quite often and it doesn't show the prices on the ticket like it used to. So you could be ordering and not realize you've spent a lot.",

Actually, they would only go half-way around then return to the door near the kitchen where they would talk.  Even though I had empty plates on my table, none of the ladies came by to see if there was anything else I wanted.  No siu mai, shrimp dumplings, steamed bbq pork buns.  I know I arrived later in the day, but I didn't realize they stopped making fresh food 1 hour or more before service ended.    The terrible service made the lack of selection all the worse.  I doubt I will go back.",

Whilst on our recent junket to Sin City, it seemed that my local Vegas friends weren't very dim sum savvy, which led me to research and... gamble... on a place I felt would suit our tastes for authentic dim sum cuisine.   That's when I discovered Chang's Hong Kong Cuisine, via the internet... and it did NOT disappoint!  Daily dim sum is always a plus in my book, and Chang's serves it up hot and fresh.  I found their service to be NICER than the local restaurants here in the OC, which gets major points in my book!    We stuck with the usual dishes; har-gow (shrimp wrapped in \"clear\" starch wrap...), vegetable shumai, lo mai gai (sticky rice with meat & mushroom mix wrapped in a lotus leaf...), a few other dishes that I have no clue the names to, lol... AND, we ordered the walnut shrimp from the regular menu.    Everything from the dim sum carts was as to be expected; hot, fresh, flavorful, and moist.  The walnut shrimp was incredible, although I felt there to be an over-abundance of the mayo sauce for my personal taste.  Did I mention how stellar the service was?  Friendly, inviting, prompt, and not \"all up in your face\".  I will visit Chang's every time I head out to Vegas, it has become my favorite local joint for good, authentic Chinese cuisine.

Until we kinda skip dim sum for couple month and go back it wasn't the same from then... We were there about 11am and only half full...

This place has been around since I was eight or nine, and my family have been returning customers as Chang's switched ownership a few times over the years.   The stuff on the steam cart is hot, fresh, and delectable, especially their siu mai and har gow (shrimp dumplings) though the rice noodles with beef or shrimp is as bountiful as Cathay House's. And on the contrary, the dishes from the cold cart (not exactly what the correct term for this is, the so-called cart contains dishes such as baked chasiubao, fried shrimp dumplings, and sesame balls) is lukewarm and leaves you yearning for more. The servers consistently refilled our tea kettles, though they failed to remove the empty porcelain and wood dishes.   Even on weekdays, Chang's is bustling and on weekends the line goes out the door. They have Chinese newspapers available in the lobby if you indulge in Chinese literature, or wish to keep your folks busy as you introduce your gwai-lo (that's for the Canto speakers) friends to dim sum.",

Workers strolling around with their carts, they show you the goods, yell out the name of the food, but you have no idea what they are saying, you point, they put it on your table, and they take your ticket and stamp it.  When you are done fast food eating style, you take your check, tally up the stamps and give you some dollar amount to pay.  I never check the amounts because I don't even know how much is each food item.  They do charge an  18% tip for parties of 6 or more which frankly is BS because they don't give you even a 5% tip worth of service.",

    "text": "Before I began my review let me preface my review by saying that I will literally eat almost any garbage and enjoy it. For example, I once stored big macs in the back seat of my car and ate them periodically through a 1 week period during the summer.  AND I ENJOYED THEM  HOWEVER, Chang's dim sum is something beyond my stomach. The smell of the dim sum was so bad , it looked absolutely disgusting the chicken feet look black.  My other order of steam chicken It looked as if the chicken was growing some kind of mold.  Both the chicken and rice smelled like chemicals and rat poisoning.  I took two bites, and almost fainted , The other interesting thing is that 20 minutes after eating the two bites, i got a little sick.  to top it all off, the server was rude.  And finally the thing that just make me almost cry was that the Fortune cookie was expired!!!!!! I want to change religion after this experience. AVOID THIS PLACE LIKE THE PLAGUE, BECAUSE YOU'LL BE SORELY DISAPPOINTED!",

    "text": "Food and service was meh ok at best. I think the food tasted a little better the day after. But why would I want to wait till then.   Anyhow I came here for the prices first but being that it's been here for so long I figured the food had to be great. Well I was wrong. Don't get me wrong the Dim Sum was not horrible I just would rather go somewhere else where you will get better food for penny's more.   The Resturant is typical Chinese dim sum set up and even with dated evidence in certain areas of the place it wasn't too bad. The service...well our server didn't seem like he wanted to be there at all or maybe that was just his un-personable personality but other then that everyone else was not bad friendly \"enough\" I guess.   The thing I did like about this place though is that they had lots of variety, I'm mean that alone made me so happy like they had tons of options. So to me I thought that was satisfying because no one likes to go to a dim sum restaurant and see 3 carts coming out to your table with the same 4 items over and over right? Right!   The food had ok flavors just some stuff didn't taste the same as you would expect it to at very other restaurant and not in a good way, like the green onions and shrimp dumpling. For example every dim sum you go to you know it will have a crispy pan fried wrap outside with a FRESH green onion crunchy flavor inside and juicy shrimp meat stuffing right? But no here it was a weird meatball with slimy green onion inside, not bad but weird. Their crispy fried crab dumpling also ok but not enough flavors and that to me would be my ultimate rating is that on a some of their suppose to be key item dim sum dishes just wasn't and mostly lacked in flavor and tasted different. Other than that the sticky rice wrapped in leaves was ok again not enough flavors. We order the calamari and fried rice from the kitchen (which does not open till like 11:30am) so if you go early don't expect to be able to order rice or anything from the kitchen. But when we did get those items the calamari was a skip but the fried rice was actually really freaking good. Their crispy taro was good and their BBQ pork pie was really good to name a few and OMG you have to try their Custard puffy pie thing for dessert. This item alone my friend will keep my business. It was the best thing I have ever tasted and I will continue to come back just for this of not anything else!   So if you want to try it try it. Just know that you well experience a little of everything because they have great selection. The food is a hit and miss and the service is not 5 stars but what do you expect. The prices are a little bit better then most places but then again the food at other places are worth the extra pennies and they do have some items that is really good. I will not run back to try their not dim sum menu but I will definitely run back for their Custard cream puff pies!!!",

The lady sat us down pretty fast. The waiter, who was an older gentlemen, was very friendly and super nice. He already gave us water to start and a menu just in case we wanted to order anything off the menu that's not in the Dim Sum Carts.   Design: The design of the restaurant could be better. As soon as you walk in, I felt the tables were too close together and that the walls were a little dirty. Especially near the cashier area where you have to pay.   The food: I felt like there could have been more choices when it came to the dim sum. I felt kind of ripped off and a little disappointed with the choices provided to us. Plus our dim sum was cold. We then ended up ordering off the menu. You can not go wrong with the HK style pan fried noodles. It was delicious! Perfect amount of sauce to noodle ratio. The portion was pretty big as well. Definitely had to take it home!   Will I ever come back here? Probably will give it another try since the service was pretty good and which is why I gave it three stars instead of two. Hopefully next time the food will be hot NOT cold.",

Being Chinese raised on some of the best dim sum San Gabriel Valley has to offer, I am confident that I am an expect in dim sum plus I had my share of dim sum from Hong Kong. Dim sum offerings are your standard, sui mai, hai gow (shrimp dumplings), tofu skin wrapped with pork and mushroom, shrimp with rice noodle, etc. Everything taste good except the shrimp from my shrimp dumplings tasted a bit fishy which usually means it was not fresh.  Their chow mein with no meat was exceptionally tasty and the texture of the noodle still retains a bit of crunchiness but not to the point of a crispy noodle style. Very tasty. Their red bean boa is excellent. Prices are very reasonable. Service was friendly and attentive.   For Las Vegas, Chang's dim sum is pretty good considering you are smack in the middle of a desert so this is an oasis if you are craving for some authentic dim sum. I also noticed alot of the customers were chinese which is a great sign. Chang's is a bit off the main strip but totally worth the trip. I will definitely come back when I am in Vegas. Bonus point, they staff all speaks cantonese so their claim of Hong Kong is valid as appose to Tawainese restaurant style dim sum or Chiu Chow style dim sum.  Note: dim sum ends at 3pm.  Happy eating.",

So we tried Chang's.    One positive is the fact that there was only a 5 minute wait, although it was a full house.  The majority of the patrons were asian so that was a good sign of its authenticity.  There also seemed to be a decent selection of dim sum options.  Here is the breakdown: THE GOOD:  -marinated and roasted pork dish with peanuts- delicious! -fried sesame ball with red beans -chicken feet  THE BAD: -fried vegetable egg rolls -har gou- the shrimp tasted weird. Must have been a bad batch. -pork shu mai- lacked flavor, had to douse it in hot sauce.   THE UGLY: -rice flour with shrimp. The shrimp tasted funny and the sauce (which is usually my favorite part) was way too sweet.  -jellyfish.  More disappointing was the fact that it was $7.95 and lacked flavor.   I don't know if I'll be back.  I'll have to try Orchid's and give other dim sum restaurants a chance.  But first, I may have to lower my expectations a bit.",

    "text": "While Chang's might not be THE best Dim Sum I've ever had, Chang's is a great Dim Sum place for what Vegas offers.   Almost always, this place is packed (at least during the weekends so anticipate waiting for a table), parking can be somewhat of a b*tch and I leave pretty satisfied with my selection of their dim sum items.   Service here is pretty typical of a Dim Sum restaurant. I wish they would come back to my table more frequently to fill me up with my favorite seafood and dessert dishes. So, because I have to wait for specific carts, I usually stay here longer than I would like to fill up on the items I adore. Portions and actual pieces of dim sum are slightly smaller than other dim sum restaurants, quality of their items are comparable and prices are definitely affordable. I like that they offer hot chrysanthemum tea here.    In sum, I'm glad Chang's exists in the valley, otherwise I'd probably suffer from dim sum withdrawals.",

    "text": "I went to this place my first day in Vegas cause I was hungry after my flight and was yearning for some Dim Sum...  The place was easy to find with GPS guidance. Chang's is located at the Southwest half of the city and looks like a new part of town since most of the buildings looked fairly new and not much traffic in the area.  The private parking lot is sufficient for all the patrons to park. Although I got there around lunch time and the place was bustling with patrons and workers I was seated very quickly.  The place is not that large and it appeared a lot of the Chinese community was there....and you know that could indicate...?  Traditional Chinese taste...and good... :-))  As soon as I sat down, the carts started swarming around the table...like a swarm of bees to their nest - very quick service with the delivery of the food and drinks.  One of the things I was impressed with at this place was that if you tried to select something off the cart that was not of proper  temperature, they wouldn't serve it but rather bring you a freshly cooked item from the kitchen...That I thought was very nice.  Additionally, I had gotten some fish and after tasting it, found it wasn't really something I liked so I told the manager my experience and he very nicely and without any further question or hesitation replaced it with another dish to my liking. Now that's service with a smile!!  Needless to say, I've found my favorite Chinese Dim Sum restaurant in Vegas! Btw, I came back for a second time that week as I was leaving Vegas?    The best part is they serve Dim Sum All Day! :-D  And the final thing is this place is just far enough away from the strip to give you a more relaxed feeling from the fast pace.  I'll be back!!! Can't wait till my next visit...not the strip but for the Dim Sum!!  Happy eating!!  Thanks to Jaymie B., the local Yelper compass that helped me get my bearing right on Chang's.  :-))",

    "text": "Pretty Fly for a White Guy  I've poked around Yelp and other ratings websites, and every now and then I see a review that decries that the restaurant that they are covering has the \"best\" dim-sum. Of course not everyone agrees as to where the best dim sum is, but they probably agree to what it is.  If you are familiar with dim sum, you may want to read their reviews instead.  If, like me, you had to go to wikipedia to figure out what dim sum is, then this is the review for you.  First - Dim Sum isn't on the menu.  In fact, there is no menu.  You are seated and given a blank card, with seperate price points.  I have eaten at a conveyor-belt-sushi place before, so I recognised this as meaning some dishes cost more than others.  Since the highest price point was about $4 I felt pretty safe.  Almost immediately, a server rolls up a cart of food.  Most of it is covered. With a bizzare amount of excitement they remove a lid and say something.  I presume they described the dish, but  1) English is a second language at Changs 2) I'm not good at decyphering accents 3) It is very noisy in here 4) I wouldn't know the difference between fan gwo and yung bau  They keep uncovering dishes, like they are working on commission or something.  You know those movies where you see the busy marketplace in China or Persia and everyone is trying to push their wares?  That's what the servers are like.  It's not high pressure though.  Say no and they shove onto the next table to try to make a sale.   I say yes to a couple of items. Chicken feet look like chicken feet, so I  stayed clear of them.  What I got was a total mystery though.  One was like a wonton soup, without the soup.  The other was like slices of sausage on a bed of carrots and cabbage.  I wish I had taken photos so someone could help me figure out what I ate.  It was pretty good though.  The server stamps my card with a little stamp.  Joy! I hit two of the lower price items.  Looking around, I see that in this packed restaurant, we are the only table without someone of Asian heritage sitting at it.  I wondered if it would be innapropriate to \"borrow\" someone else's Chinaman for lunch.  Most of the tables had more than their fair share.  Then I have a plan.  Just watch what other people are getting, then when something that looks the same comes my way, I'll get that.  My new plan gets me a tasty gooey rice wrapped in a big leaf.  This is very good.  Our card gets stamped with a different color stamp (maybe they do work for commision) and we hit the $4 item.  We are getting full, and I see someone get a plate of sesame seed covered balls, and put them directly into a to-go box.  I figure it must be a dessert that is so good, people get them even when they are stuffed.  The cart comes by and boom - I point and they deliver.  It may be uncouth, but if nobody explains proper custom, then I will make up my own.  The sesame balls are tasty dough balls with a sweet purple filling.  I will call them Chinese doughnuts.  Not as sweet as a regular doughnut, I could sit down with a dozen of these and a cup of coffee every morning.  Thanks \"to-go box family\" for the tip!  To sum up dim sum:  It was good when I was just guessing.  It was better when I was spying on others.  Maybe next time I will bring binoculars. I never felt out of place, even though I clearly was, so kudos to the staff there.  If you are ready for an adventure, I would reccommend Changs.  I'm unqualified to say it's the best, but for a good -and different- lunch for two under $22, it's worth trying.",

This is your typical old style dim sum joint, where the ladies are pushing the carts around circling the restaurant.    It gets really crowded especially on weekends, where its hard to find parking and the wait can be a little long.  The weekdays are easier, but still gets crowded.   We usually order, siu mai, beef noodles, shrimp noodles, tofu, egg tarts etc.   If you see the ladies with the salt & pepper shrimp and the chow mein, dont get it unless you like cold food.  Most of the other carts have food warmers.  I had to deduct a star this time  because the shrimp was cold (yuck! ). That would be a health code violation in CA, I think.  The siu mai wasnt that great this time either.  It usually is okay.  Oh yeah, it gets really loud in this place, so if you are coming here for a business meeting , err dont. Unless you dont mind screaming across the table. LOL",

    "text": "After eating at Ping Pang Pong (PPP), I can't give any other dim sum place in Vegas more than a few stars.  The pluses for Chang's: shrimp noodle with the watery soy sauce, the 100 year old duck porridge is pretty good but doesn't top PPP's, egg custard bao with crispy top is OK but doesn't top Orchid Garden's for sure!  The triangle dim sum with the flaky crust, and BBQ pork inside is good, better than Orchid's Garden, but does NOT top PPP's.    Boo's go to the sticky Har gow, and shrimp, pork and green onion dumpling does not surpass any other restaurant especially because the dumpling was super cold like it came straight out the fridge.  We didn't have to wait to be seated, and food came around fast on a Sunday at 12 noon so not bad.    But food was just OK.  Some cold!   Will I be back?  If I'm too lazy to drive to Orchid's Garden, or woke up too late to go to PPP.  Nah..I probably won't come back!",

    "text": "We had a slightly better experience on our second visit here. They changed their ordering process and it's a lot more organized now. Plus, I didn't use their restroom this time around (that scared me on my previous visit.)  We came in around 3:30pm on a Saturday. After we were seated, the manager/server handed us a double sided piece of paper with the dim sum and prices listed - we just marked off on the sheet what we wanted, then we handed it back to our server and they began making it in the kitchen.  The food was inconsistent compared to our last visit - Items that I didn't care for, were actually good this time around and vice versa.  My Favorites: - Juicy fried shrimp balls with sweet mayo are consistently delicious, plump, and flavorful. - Fluffy (white) steamed BBQ pork buns were moist, freshly steamed, and stuffed generously with flavorful BBQ pork - They weren't soggy like our first visit. We also took 2 orders to-go and they were still delicious the next day!) - Har Gow wasn't incredible, they were slightly hardened/dry but they were decently flavored. - Sui Mai were moist, plump and satisfying.  I'll Pass:  - Dry and minimal filling in the (glazed) baked BBQ pork buns. It was practically all bread and no BBQ pork.  - Tiny and dried out egg custard tarts. - Sloppy and breaking apart cheong fun (rice noodle rolls) with 2 tiny shrimp per noodle. The flavor was average, but the noodles were chunky and dense.   Chang's is not a terrible option for dim sum, plus they serve dim sum all day so that's always a plus! However, if it's before 3pm I'll still recommend KJ dim sum for the most satisfying dim sum. That's my spot!   Previous 2 star review: -------------------------- I've concluded that KJ Dim Sum still holds the throne for the best dim sum. I mean, don't get me wrong, there were some items from Chang's that were legit and done very well, but there were more fails than wins.   My favorites: - Shrimp har gow (shrimp dumplings) - this was amazing the first round, delicate and lightly sweet, but the second round was lacking a lot of flavor and not as tender.  - Cheong Fun (Rice Noodle Rolls) with Shrimp - lovely pillowy soft noodle texture, but 2 miniature shrimps in each roll.   - Fried Shrimp Balls served with sweet mayo. This was our absolute favorite, the shrimp balls were super moist inside and flavorful.  I'll pass: - Pork Sui Mai - This classic was shamefully bland and unmemorable. - Steamed BBQ Pork Buns - they were on the mushy soggy end. The minimal BBQ pork filling wasn't bad, but it's also not the best either.  - Chicken Feet - good flavor, but fatty and I couldn't get past how oily it was. - Fried Taro Puffs stuffed with pork - It had a nice pillowy taro texture, but it was extra soggy on the bottom from being soaked in oil.  We came here on a Sunday at about 3pm and even though they advertised that Dim Sum is served all day, we were having a difficult time ordering it. Only one lady came out with a cart when we sat down. After we grabbed a couple items from her cart, they all bounced and started their lunch - so no one served us for the rest of our meal. There were no carts to be seen. We wanted to order more, but no one came to check on us.  We finally got the manager to serve us since he was the only one not on his lunch break. He seemed a little agitated that we wanted to order more. Not to mention, they ran out of a couple items that we wanted to order.  Pro Tip: come during prime breakfast and brunch hours- any time after that the service and food will be nonexistent.   The restaurant didn't give off a clean vibe. The bathrooms are super sketchy, old, sticky, and scary. It makes me wonder what's the condition of the kitchen.  All of this made it a less than desirable dining experience. We will continue to enjoy the excellent service, pristine cleanliness, better prices, better selection at KJ Dim Sum. Plus KJ has the best egg custard tarts of my entire life! They're damn good.",

I've heard a lot of up-and-down things about this place over the past several years, and I think that's what made me resistant to trying this spot out. After coming here, I would say it's a very solid spot for some dim sum.  After walking in, there is a fairly large dining room that is well kept and preserved. It's somewhat elegant in a way. The cart pushers seem to have a very good handle on the situation, constantly refilling and making sure the peeps are always getting what they need, and that is really important.  Onto the food. I liked everything, while I've been to places that do certain things better, I was really happy with what was received. No complains whatsoever. The food here is solid all around. But, the prices might be hard to beat here. Every time I go to KJ's at the Rio, I end up spending around 25 dollars for the food, whereas at Chang's, I believe I had gotten more food here than at KJ's, but I only spent 15 dollars. So, I think the value here is better.  A solid dim sum spot in town. Very good execution and will hope to see things start to rise up from here on out.",

    "text": "Nothing beats eating dim sum the morning after partying all night in Vegas. After being spoiled by eating at so many good dim sum places back home in Monterey park/Rowland area, Chang's felt subpar to me. For all my OC ppl visiting Vegas & thinkin about trying this place, I would say it's comparable to dragon phoenix in Bolsa. You have the ladies rollin the cart around, which I don't really prefer because the temperature of the items were barely warm  Surprisingly though, the servers were on top of it here. I don't really expect much service from a chinese restaurant, but our water cups were never empty and the manager was a really friendly guy. We later found out they speak cantonese here, and once again I was used as the person to order everything for the table because I was the only one that spoke cantonese -__-  The place looked really clean for a chinese restaurant and the prices weren't bad.  They had all the dim sum basics such as shu mai, har gow, chinese broccoli, chicken feet, etc. The dim sum items such as shu mai and har gow were a bit small though. The good thing is I don't think they load up on MSG here and the food wasn't too salty. The congee was a rip off though because there was barely any shredded dry pork in it and the fried donuts weren't like the ones back at home.The fried donuts to dip in the congee were too crispy and there was a lot of oil on the plate.  Not too bad of a place to grab dim sum in Vegas. My friend said it's a lot better than Ping Pong Pang's",

I was originally pretty excited, because we had previously had Dim Sum with them a few times and had a really great time, but Chang's was disappointing.  First of all, this is not a place I would recommend if you are new to Dim Sum. There were just a few carts in a huge dining room, and they never came over to our table without us having to flag them down. They didn't give us any information about what was on the cart and answered a few questions pretty begrudgingly. If you're eating here and are pretty familiar with the standard Dim Sum dishes you would probably be fine, but as someone who didn't know what she was looking at it was very frustrating.   The hostess in the front of the restaurant was very friendly and helpful, though, she helped a friend of ours get one of her favorite dishes that wasn't on any of the carts (they were either missing a lot of things because it was busy or they didn't have a wide variety of options to choose from). The parking was limited and crowded, as was the dining room. I've only visited on a busy weekend, but the dining room was very loud when we were there.  While the food we did get was good, the selection and service means we probably won't be back. I'm just not a fan of any restaurant where I leave hungry!",

Got the steamed sticky rice, pork BBQ buns, sesame balls, beef chow fun, fried noodles, Chinese broccoli. Pretty good for Las Vegas.   This place is sort of a hidden gem since it doesn't even come up in the list of dim sum places in Vegas.   This place is smaller than Orchid but I think slightly better in quality.  Haven't bothered trying the casino dim sum spots since not sure they push carts and I imagine paying double.   This place is good in terms of service, quality, and value.

Pros  Service: the only thing that was favorable during my early morning dim sum run was the service. They were polite and quick when it came to takings orders. Although some of the ladies with the carts can skip your table.   Cons  Siu Mai & Har Gow: These are the basics for serving dim sum and it was such a let down. The fillings tasted bad and not enough shrimp was used. The har gow was the worst since the filling wasn't True to its original recipe.   Fried Shrimp Dumpling: It was more like shrimp wontons since it was so tiny. There was more skin than the actual filling so all I could taste was the fried wonton wrapper.   Chicken Feet: By far the worst tasting chicken feet, even the Chinese fast food places makes a better version.",

We got there at around 4pm, and was surprised that they don't have their workers pushing around the carts with the food on them.   At this dim sum, when it's close to 5pm they give you a chart where you circle what you want. I was quite disappointed that I couldn't see what I like and immediately grab it.   We we're also confuse because we both aren't familiar with the names of dim sum food so we were constantly describing the server what we wanted and he had to circle it on our charts.   The food was pretty good but not as great as the dim sum in downtown LA chinatown.  I recommend the rice noodle with shrimp and beef. Super tasty! And are my favorites.    Price was decent. We ended up paying $30 for like 8 dishes.",

Ordered the egg tarts, siu mai, BBQ pork bun, beef chow fun, sweet tofu, gai lan with oyster sauce, chicken fingers, chinese donuts, and another tofu dish.   Overall bill came out to $60 for five of us. Service was average but that was to be expected for a Chinese restaurant.  I know my dim sum pretty well and also had the legit stuff in Hong Kong and I'd say the flavors and taste were totally off for all the dishes we had and everything was just average.

We decided one day 6 months ago to give them a shot one more time and they did a great job, so we started going back regularly 4-5 times a month.   We went last week and it was very disorganized and disappointing. The dim sum was ICE cold and the dim sum carts weren't going in a rotation properly. On the way out the door we told one of the owners and he just smiled and shook his head, so come to find out he doesn't speak English?  Decided to give them another chance today. The dim sum carts were disorganized again, dim sum cold and now one of the items we ordered tasted like cleaning chemical that someone sprayed on the food. We tried to speak to another owner and come to find out she doesn't speak English either? How can you own a business in the US and not be able to affectively communicate in English? Good luck if you decide to try this place!  Either way we won't be back anytime soon. I guess we'll have to wait for another ownership change.",

For one thing, this place is fairly authentic and not your fancy, over-the-top resort casino dim sum restaurant where you get ripped-off for mediocre food.   Chang's offer a wide variety of dim sum dishes to choose from. We got the Chinese sliced BBQ prok \"cha-shu\", shrimp dumplings \"ha-gow\", shu-mai , Chinese broccoli \"gai-lan\", salt and pepper squid and prawns. Their BBQ pork steam buns \"cha-shu bao\" were decent and the fried taro dumplings were excellent. The steamed soy-skin wrapped with bamboo and pork was surprisingly good.   The service was good and what makes it such a sight for sore eyes is seeing older Chinese people sitting at the table next to us relaxing and reading newspapers while enjoying their dishes. Now that speaks volumes.",

    "text": "(3.4 star) In Las Vegas when you think about dim sum you think about Chang's Hong Kong Cuisine, well Chang's and maybe 2 or 3 other places. It is a popular place for dim sum and has been around for years. Chang's was actually my first real dim sum experience, sure I've had the various dim sum items before but I never eaten in the \"dim sum\" environment where an old little Asian lady goes around pushing her cart offering food served from steamer containers until Chang's.  Nothing I've had wowed me to point of shouting \"OH THIS IS THIS BEST THING EVER!\" but majority of what I've had were delicious with some meh items. They have all of my favorites. You have to either like or dislike dim sum to eat at a dim sum place and I'm in the middle. I like eating dim sum items but don't like eating at time dim sum places. I'll eat or try almost everything they have to offer except the weird stuff. It's kind of hard to keep track of what you've eaten until the end because they'll come around fast with multiple carts and containers, they'll show you various items, and you just say that you want it or not. It's easy to get carried away. There will be containers on the table and you won't remember what they are, surprise.  Overall I don't think it's the best \"dim sum\" experience you can have in Vegas but I'll probably be back just for the food. It's spacious but can fill up, reasonably priced but can really add up if you want to eat a lot, clean but not so clean, it's old and does look like it needs work. They're friendly and fast but nothing out of the ordinary.",

I'm a fan\" rating... but it's definitely more than an \"A-OK\"... like A-I could be a fan.  Service was the same as any other dimsum places.  Some are rude and some are nice... but at a dimsum place like this, you are not really paying for the service so you kinda have to let that go.  They pretty much had everything I wanted from sticky rice, shumai, spare ribs, that fried taro thing, tripe, congee, eggrolls you name it.  Their boba tasted pretty nasty tho... so don't get boba there.

Apparently Las Vegas has a lot of Asians because there's a pretty expansive China Town that we saw as we made our way to the Strip. We had landed, picked up our rental and immediately made our way here for Dim Sum on a Sunday. The place was decently sized and wasn't overcrowded.  The food was really good, particularly the fried shrimp balls, which is my favorite dim sum item. As a bonus, it came with this mayo sauce that usually accompanies fried shrimp wontons, which was also delicious. We got too many items for me to list but overall, try as much food as you can because it was all tasty!  An added bonus was the price: $70 for 5 people, and we were all stuffed and satisfied. Usually we're spending $50-60 on 4 people and we're still left hungry after eating at the dim sums in Dallas. Definitely eat here!",

Once you start chomping on these things, its hard to stop.  Well, maybe the warning sign from your greasy fingers will make you stop, but these things are damn tasty.  Best I've ever had.  All the shrimp dishes were great.  Har Gow, shumai, rice noodle roll thing.  Chicken feet - not one of my favorite foods in the world, and I was reminded why.  But if its your thing, my friend seemed to enjoy it.  Egg custard - great!  Steamed egg cake - also great!  All in all, not bad.  But maybe next time we'll take a chance on those other restaurants near the massage parlors.",

We came on Christmas Eve morning and there were about 8-10 tables filled.  Even then, service began to suck.  The hostess never brought my coke that I asked for, TWICE!  The carts were very, very, very slow.  Like us, there were several others eating a couple of items and then sat and waited for another cart to come by.    Tables began to fill up quickly.  They were way understaffed.  The hostess was doing it all, seating, getting drinks and utensils, and taking the checks.  Carts would disappear into the other room and we looked around for a cart.  There was no cart in the main dining room!  That's just ridiculous.  We felt that there was no organization at all.  In the end, we just wanted to leave since nothing else was happening.  Our check just took forever to come.  Two days later, we went to have dim sum again but at Orchids.  See my review there.  Since I come out to Vegas quite often, I might consider coming here again.",

Staffed with a primarily Cantonese speaking staff adds to the authenticity.   Food wise, most of it tastes as good as the regular restaurants I grew up with in Asia. Their egg tarts have the best pastry skin I've ever had in America and is even better than many in Asia. The only downside is their steamed BBQ pork bun doesn't taste that good, perhaps due to a poor supply of pork in this area. Fried buns are excellent though.  Value wise, this is one of the cheapest dim sum restaurants I've been to in the US. To sum it up, an excellent choice and great value.",

I really enjoyed the fried wontons with shrimp, the shrimp sausage, the bbq pork buns and the rice with sausage shrimp and ground pork.  Yum!  I didn't get much detail about the food and what was in them, so if you have food allergies beware.  Also, there were veggies.  I made the mistake of getting too many meat/seafood items before snagging a little bit of bok choy.  A balanced diet with veggies is the way to go!  The price was excellent!  You've got everything from $2 items to about $9 bucks.  Also, bring a partner because you can try many things and still leave thinking you ran away with bank.  Again Yum!!!",

Especially after a drunken night, what better way to erase that hangover than with some ha gow, su mai, and hot jasmine tea?  Dishes that I didn't like:  -congee (rice porridge): it was too thin and wasn't enough thousand year old eggs chunks :(   -chicken feet: I've had better. I noticed a pool of clear fat in the dish. Haha :(  Loved the su mai, ha gow, shrimp balls, and the FRIED TARO. Get it. It was some crazy transitioning with the crispiness, and then soft taro, and then cloud 9!!!   Also try the pineapple cream pastry. I have no idea what they call it but I included a picture. Looks like a mushroom. Came out HOT and DRIPPING with the egg yolk cream inside. Mmmmmmhhh!!!  5 stars for such great prices (our bill was $21!!!! And we are fat pigs too!!) and pretty good food! Thank you for existing, Chang's.",

I did the eating. The chrysanthemum tea was an interesting change-up (we had that and regular tea). You gotta drink tea when you Yum Cha!  Overall, it was a great lunch that worked out to be $14 per person. I'm probably not that picky when it comes to Dim Sum items. Chang's earns my fandom.",

I usually come right at 11 when they open and there are already people waiting at the door. Because it's still early, we get good seats and the food is hot and fresh. We are in and out in 30 minutes.   The dim sum is better than other places in LV I have tried. I especially like pork spareribs, pork dumplings and egg custard tarts  I agree service can be a bit off sometimes. For all the times I've been here, it has been 80% good and 20% poor. But keep in mind I am ordering and speaking to them in Cantonese.   I would like to note old-school Chinese restaurants like Chang's don't really specialize in great service, it's get in, eat and get out.",

We went there to eat in December and it was 49 degrees outside.   But, inside this restaurant it was easily over 80 degrees from all the people and the heat from the kitchen.  The few ceiling fans only pushed the hot air around.  So, if you have low tolerance for heat and stifling stuffiness, avoid this place.

Other favorites are the salt and pepper squid and their crispy seafood noodles.  However, the reason why I'm taking a star off is that their service is pretty terrible. For example, the last time we were there, the server took forever to take our orders, didn't say a word to us when we were giving him our order, and just slammed the food on our table and walked away. My mom and I pretty much just had to laugh it off because it was that bad.  Other than that, Chang's is pretty good. We'll be back in the future because it's one of our staple places. And because that crispy noodle is pretty freakin' good.",

Tried this place for the first time today after setting low dim sum expectations for Las Vegas from past experiences at Ping Pang Pong, Orchid Garden and Cathay House.   There were only two of us, so we expected to be seated with another group, but Chang's actually has 2-person tables available so we were able to sit by ourselves. Less than a 5-minute wait to get seated on a Sunday at 12:30pm, so things were looking up.   This is considerably smaller than most dim sum banquet halls I'm used to (compared to ones in Houston, Boston and New York), but the food is all fresh and all the carts made their way to our table within 15 minutes. Food was fantastic -- the Chinese broccoli wasn't as bitter as it normally is with other restaurants, leek buns were phenomenal and all the standard dim sum dishes (shiomai, hakaw) were on point. They also had salt and pepper shrimp and Thai iced tea in the carts, which was a nice surprise.   No doubt that this is now our go-to dim sum place in Las Vegas!",

The har gow isn't particularly special here, but the xia chang fun is good and not too doughy. The cha siu pao here is one of my favorites of all cha siu pao's - the filling is flavorful and the bun is always fluffy.  The service is great and the prices are even better - usually comes out to about $10/person, including tax/tip. Love it!",

Not only he forgot what we asked for, when we asked him again he proceed to argue with us.  The food.   Well.   I don't know what you guys are talking about when you say good.  It is mediocre at best.  We only came this time cause we forgot we have been to it before. Until we drove to it. So super hungry and we settled.  When we asked them for the bill. They just wrote down the total instead of breaking down the bill. When I asked if he was gonna tell us how much each item cost. He just gave me a dirty look like \"seriously\". Then proceed to write the price on the side of the bill.  These are two different waiters  The employees of this place require a basic lesson in manner. They should know that they live in America now and that when someone asks them something with regard to their job. They should response. It's ok for Chinese people to understand the \"silent acknowledgement \" but in America we like to verbally communicate.",

My brother and I were glad to walk into the cool restaurant that many claim has the hottest, best dim sum in Vegas.  It was totally crowded at 11:30 AM on Sunday.   Looking at the waiting room and restaurant, 90 per were speaking Cantonese, but there were some token Filipinos (my brother and I were representin' along about 10 others). and other Asian  families. The hostess didn't take any names down at first, and suddenly five parties arrived after us. We were a feisty, grumpy hungry group in the waiting area  So, I loudly reminded the hostess we were next,  Her eyes bugged out and looked a little spooked, and immediately seated us in the only empty table that seats six!.  The hostess left and the so called waitress asked for our drink order. Drinks came out right away but it took another 15 minutes for her to return when we asked for hot tea besides our cokes.    The cute smiley old ladies with the carts were really helpful and were glad to describe what they had. Geez some of these cart pushers were pushy! A few didn't speak much English, but I give them credit for trying. We had the following but didn't know which price group each was:  siu mai - good, flavorful blend of pork and shrimp wokked gai lan - my favorite veggie when sauteed right and it was chow mein thin noodles - really good, not too salty a simple dish but cool, not warm barbecue pork - juicy, good charred meat and tender inside meat balls - kind of rubbery, decent not great rice cake (plus two orders to go) - awesome if you like this dish, sweet and subtle taste, soft marshmallow texture mango mochi cake - our favorite item, with fresh mini piece of sliced mangoes, mango pudding inside mochi and topped with shredded coconut sesame do-nut balls - really good, sweet with ample sesame seeds, really crunchy when warm  So we finished about 2/3 the order, and the waitress gave us boxes. She brings out the check. $38 before tip for all that. When she saw I was filling in the tip box, she started her smiling, and engaged in some small talk with us. \"Do you want water?  Do you want more tea?  Anything else? LOL, she has great timing.. Overall, prices are pretty good for what you get.  Service was OK. Overall, I thought they compared pretty well with places like New Capital in Monterey Park, some of the Oakland and SF dim sum places, and even some places in Hong Kong.  I'll be back.",

Compared to that, Chang's was just ordinary for me.  The dim sum selection was not as extensive and pretty much average in taste. The fried shrimp ball was an exception. It was very tasty and not greasy at all. The steamed spare ribs (paired with some bits of squash) was also a pleasant surprise. The coconut milk taro cake had a faint coconut flavor which I liked. The cake does not resemble a cake. It reminds me more of a silky tofu.  I haven't tried too many dim sum places in Vegas so I don't have a baseline to compare it to. The selections I had from the dim sum menu were decent. I left very satisfied and I would come back to try their a la carte menu as well.",

Also noted that the signs near the door stated that the restaurant opened at 10 am, earlier than what is listed on Yelp.  Overall, food was good. Service was hit or miss. Some servers were great, others weren't responsive at all (the congee cart specifically took more than 90 minutes and multiple requests to the other servers and hostess before we got our dishes. Needless to say, there were certain members of the party that really wanted congee...). I'd recommend sitting near the double happiness sign for best service as all the carts come out from there.   They were constantly coming out with new freshly cooked hand made dishes. Our favorites included the shumai, pork ribblets, and the shrimp balls (fried and steamed). Only complaint food-wise was that a few of the other balls and shrimp dumplings had too much corn starch and not enough meat.  A little pricier than what we're used to back in Michigan (might be due to tax) but would come back again.",

Those tasted great.   Some of the servers do not speak English, I didn't find that appalling at all since that is very common in some Chinese restaurants in town. They were still quite nice and we had good service.  My only complaint would be the taste of the water and that we had to wait over 15 minutes for sesame balls.   I would definitely go here again though. I really like that they weren't very crowded.",

Are you kidding me?!  Awful customer service and clearly just trying to make sure they get the money because they could have easily submitted the prompt back to me through the Postmates system when they first accepted the order saying the two items were unavailable and would I like to remove those items or substitute something else. Instead they make the driver come all the way there, taking their sweet time and not even preparing the order. Ridiculous. Don't order from them.",

The staff who serves food in carts all of a sudden came quickly to our table after we sat. We got tons of food from Shu Mui, BBQ Pork Buns, Coconut Buns, Hao Cho, and more. The food were very DELICIOUS and NOT AS SALTY as the other Dim Sum restaurant which was GOOD. We were only in there for about 30 minutes and WE WERE FULL.   If you want something QUICK, I RECOMMEND coming to this place because the wait time wasn't bad during weekdays.

    "text": "Chang's, new owners and staff, but kept the old name. Serves Dim Sum, lunch, and dinner.  New owners are very nice, they walk around and say Hi and Thank you to the guests. Make sure that we are satisfied with the device and food.  Atmosphere: Like most busy Chinese Restaurants, it can get noisy, but that's how a busy place usually is. Not an issue. The place has been cleaned up and kept clean throughout the day, the bathroom is clean and full of toiletries.  Food and service: We had dim sum here in a Saturday. That place was pretty packed, but food cam out hot. The carts came around frequently with fresh dishes. The most common dishes did run out, but it was quickly refilled and the cart pusher came around to ask if we still wanted some, which was great! We ordered quite a few things, but certain ones were especially tasty. BBQ Pork Bun, Baked. The Bun was big, but the breading was nice and thin, and crispy. Every note has BBQ Pork in it, which is wonderful. Most places have a super thick bread and barely any meat. The Egg Tart was delicious! The Egg custard was creamy and not too sweet, very good consistency. The Tart Crust was flaky, crispy, and thin. Perfect size to finish to 2-3 bites. Steam Rice Flour (Chang Funn), rolled nicely. Thin yet didn't break apart when we picked up with chopsticks. Chewy texture and no flour residue. Soy Sauce Fried Noodles, was nice a crispy, but not dry.  Price is not bad at all. Average for dim sum prices, similar to other popular Dim Sum places. Definitely coming back to try dinner.",

This place is always packed when I come here.   I've never been disappointed with my food. My favorite is the shrimp noodle and the pork bun mmm. Service is fine, nothing amazing, but pretty standard for dim sum. If you're used to eating out at Chinatown, you should be used to being a little aggressive in getting a server's attention haha.   Always a good meal here, I'll keep coming back for sure.",

The food is just as good or better and there are more selections if you go an hour after it opens. We got there exactly when it opened and there were very few selections. After 30 minutes of eating and getting full, we were like, dam we should have came 1 hour later. Many more selections like small sizes of walnut shrimp!. (never seen that before). Service is a little iffy, but what can you expect if it is an authentic chinese restaurant. Its definatlely authentic when the server throws the dimsum we order across the table like we were playing frisbee together in the park.  Overall, its a solid dim sum place and pretty dam chinese. I would recconmmend if your craving some dimsum in vegas.",

They have all the fundamental dishes for yum cha, yet I like them less than their competitor. I did not see the tofu skin wraps, spare ribs, tendon, and fried taro cakes on my last visit. The first dish is one of my all time favorites and the last is my mom's.   I am certain the reason why I like them less is because they lack the chili oil sauce. They serve the vinegar red chili sauce instead and that gives everything a more sour kick than a spicy one. Some might not believe it, but this condiment makes the whole experience more enjoyable. I am willing to do more math, and risk being swindled for it.   The service at Chang's is quick and friendly. I swear, I should like Chang's more, but the feast feels limited and my dim sum taste is vast.",

    "text": "Things have changed since my last review of Chang's, so it looks like another update is necessary!  First off - the sign out front!  Yay, they got rid of that faded old sign advertising Chang's.  Although I'm not particularly fond of their tacky new font, at least it's legible!   Looks like prices have gone up too!  Group A - $2 Group B - $2.75 Group C - $3.95  Group D - $5.95 Group E - $7.95  For our hungry party of three, we had five items from Group A, seven items from Group B, and one item from Group C.  They included:  * Shrimp Dumplings * Pork Dumplings * Beef Ball * Tofu Skin Roll * Steamed Tripe * Beef Rice Noodle Roll * Chicken Feet in Black Bean Sauce  * Deep Fried Ground Pork Dumpling * Deep Fried Taro and Ground Pork Dumpling * Shanghai Dumplings (Group C) - It's something they don't push around in the carts.  You have to put in a special order for it.  Our order was had four dumplings, but you can request eight.  It came out piping hot - just the way it's supposed to be.  Be careful with the soup inside because it burned my tongue!   The whole point of going out for dim sum is to \"yum cha\" which means to drink tea. Therefore, tea charges is as follows:  * Tea is $.50/person * Chrysanthemum tea is $1/per person  I wanted to end our lunch with something sweet and looked over the Egg Custard Tarts.  They appeared to be the same ones that were out when we first arrived, so I passed on that.  We also skipped on the Egg Custard Pineapple Bun this time around since we didn't see them come out fresh, and these buns needed to be eaten piping hot only!  They did offer the dessert tofu dish, but that's not my favorite.  Perhaps they need a better sweet selection or at least a higher turnover on it so things can still come out fresh!   The service was surprisingly attentive on a Monday and there was no wait.  Our water glasses and tea pot were constantly refilled without us asking, which we really appreciated.  A large bus group did arrive shortly after us and did take up some of the attention, but it was understandable.  Unfortunately, they do not have hot chili oil anymore, just the regular hot chili sauce.  I'll continue to ask for it in case they bring it back!  3.5 stars",

As dim sum offerings are not as common where I'm from, I was very surprised to find a place that would offer full cart service on a Thursday afternoon around 2 o'clock.   Win.    While this wasn't the best dim sum I've ever had, it did have a really good selection.  I didn't love the siu mai or the chicken feet, but the shrimp hargow, the baked char siu bao, and the rice flat noodle with beef and/or shrimp were very tasty.  I'm not much of a fan of fried dim sum, so I didn't really try any of those offerings, but what I did try was pretty good.    I was also pleased with the ample parking, the service (which was not that bad), and the fact that I came in with half of a party of 9 and they still insisted on seating us right when we got there.  I still have yet to try other dim sum offerings in Vegas, but this was not a bad start!",

Our eyes were definitely bigger than our tummies.  Surprisingly, my favorites were 2 non-meat items: fried noodles and Gai lan in oyster sauce. Add that to my cup of hot tea, and I'm in my happy place. Yummm! Yummm! My only big complaint was that they did not have my chili oil, which gives a kick to anything that you eat here.

The reason behind the 1 star rating is not the unremarkable food or even the poor, slow service we experienced. It wasn't the fact that the cashier was unprofessional and stuffing his face behind the counter while wiping his mouth with his hands in between transactions. It's the fact that their restrooms are so dirty it makes me worry about the cleanliness if the kitchen. If they're willing to let their patrons see mold growing in around the sink counters, garbages overflowing with paper towels, and used toilet paper strewn all the floors then what kind of standards of cleanliness could they possibly adhere to in the kitchen? I wish I would have made a stop in the restroom before I started eating... If I had then I wouldn't have even given their food a chance! Skip Chang's until they can clean the place up!",

Anyway sorry for side tracking haha, I came here on a Saturday to satisfy my dim sum craving. They serve dim sum everyday, however they can improve their food quality. The shrimp dumplings were too sticky for my liking and seemed like they were sitting there for awhile. Also there was a huge language barrier, the servers didn't know English, but they always had a smile on their face :) one of the ladies brought a menu so I could decide my selection, since they were serving from a cart and communication was limited. I found my eggplant stuffed shrimp and egg custard buns. The order came without an eggplant stuffed shrimp instead it was made with green bell peppers! It still tasted good, although my hopes were for delicious eggplant. Also I ordered the Chinese broccoli, which was the only good thing they made! I won't be coming here again despite the cheap prices. It wasn't satisfying to my liking.",

It was a fun experience with all the friends but as far as the food, I'd put this in as a never again, no way, and horrible.I have always loved Chinese food but this was just terrible.

A standout was the roast duck, whose skin was very crispy and the meat was thick.  I have no idea how much it cost but it was sufficient in quantity to be shared by 3 hungry male adults.  Easy location near Orleans, Palms, and several timeshare properties.  Bill for 5 adults and 4 children was $78.20 including tip, for eating dim sum until full but not gorging.  Note: the room was warm, not nearly as hot as the 110 degrees it was outside when we visited, but not quite comfortable either, and  worthy of checking the AC system.",

I showed up alone at 5 pm on a Wednesday and ordered mostly off the dinner dim sum menu (short but adequate). The exceptional: steamed beef tripe, tender but just toothy enough for interest, fresh clean warm taste perfumed with ginger - excellent. I asked for pu-erh tea and it was very high grade for a restaurant - good body and a hint of chaparral in the aroma. Very good: black rice coconut cake - jelled and sweet w distinct favors, very sweet. Chicken shrimp pork in tofu skin wrapper with a nice light gravy. Quarter duck (asked for, half duck would have been too much) perfectly rich and crispy with a little sauce over excellent home pickled vegetables. Hot sauce came without asking. I way over ate.  Solidly good service: sweet older man who seated me got a sparkle in his eye when I requested the pu erh. Friendly younger waiter; both checked regularly to make sure I had what I needed but left me quietly reading and typing. Very relaxing.  Decor is aging a bit but clean, no smell, temp was good. I saw a stack of high chairs and booster seats.  So 5 stars on my experience. I look forward to trying their dim sum carts on a weekend and hope my experience holds up. Even if it doesn't I think you can't go amiss with those specific dishes.",

    "text": "I'll start by saying that I'm from Hawaii and we have some excellent dim sum choices available to us on the island. Therefore, I felt the dim sum here at Chang's was just okay at best. I tried some of the basics, including their shu mai, ha gau, and the charsiu bao.  I had big pieces of shrimp in my shu mai, but the pork flavor was lacking. The ha gau wrapper was mushy, but at least the shrimp tasted okay. The charsiu bao paper was difficult to remove. It was almost steamed into the bun itself. I had to dig into the bun a bit on one of them to remove the paper. The flavor of the charsiu bao was just okay, too. None of the other items I tried were anything to write home about.   One other thing I noticed was their chili sauce seemed to be watered down somehow, like they added some water to stretch the sauce. Overall, I probably won't make a return visit on any future trips to Vegas.",

    "text": "My friends, my family, and I have frequented Chang's Hong Kong Cuisine for dim sum for as long as I could remember. When my family wants dim sum, this is the place to go. When my friends want dim sum, this is the place to go. However, after being away from Vegas for the past 3 years, things have drastically changed. I'm not sure if it's because of my taste buds or perhaps with other dim sum places popping up, such as KJ Kitchen at Rio....things have changed at Chang's.  Quality certainly has gone downhill. The service, on the other hand, I have seen no changes. It's still just like any other Chinese place where it's hard to find anyone to help you when you need it.   My family and I came here for lunch this past Sunday and I must say, it was very disappointing. Half of the food that we wanted weren't readily available -- they were making it in the back. Some of them came out and some just were never ready. There used to be a lot more carts going around but now it's been reduced to about 3-4 different cards. It also used to be a whole lot more busy here so I assume because of the lack of business, they no longer have that many carts going around.   The food? Not memorable at all. AT ALL. Some of it was kind of gross .. even for me! The quality sure has changed!    Overall, I wouldn't suggest this place for dim sum. It's honestly only \"okay\" because this certainly isn't the worst place.",

Checked it out with my girlfriend after our sudden craving for dim sum.   In comparison:  East Ocean: Not as expensive as this place.  There are more than 2 carts going around serving you food  Harbor Palace:  This place is really dirty.  Food seems like its been hanging out in the cart all day and the service isn't that great.  The staff was very friendly.  Food is constantly being regulated throughout the restaurant and they offer all the delights of a standard dim sum (shu mai, chicken feet etc...)   Food highlights:    1. The pork belly is an absolute must get, I kid you not. This exceeds any pork belly i've gotten at goyemon, AYCE kbbq and lechon at the several filipino parties i've been to.  The skin is deep fried to utter perfection while the meat is juicy and very tender.  2. Deep fried shrimp balls with the sweet mayo  3. The duck was very good but a little on the saucy side  4. Chicken feet was delicious.  Plenty of cartilage to suck on   Service:  A lot of the staff speak 0 english.  Even if you have dark skin, pale skin or blue skin, they will talk to you in chinese.  Staff is very friendly and anyone is willing to stop what they are doing to see what you need.  Overall, a great dim sum spot in Las Vegas without compromising your wallet or food quality",

Of course, once you get your table, the food comes to you so you don't have long to wait for it.  The salted fish fried rice is awesome... and they have pretty good chow fun too. The pan fried egg noodles were a little bland though.  I can see this place being great for big groups and even banquets. Service though is typically rushed and brusque. ***************************** Dinner here is a totally different experience than dim sum. The restaurant is practically empty at night! Food is still very good and service has more time to smile and check back with you.",

    "text": "For a True taste of a traditional dim sum lunch in Vegas, you gotta come to Chang's. Professional dimsum ladies, the ones who are generally pissed off at their jobs and tired to shouting the same thing all day, are all about in this restaurant.   My favorite part is the carpet when you walk in. This carpet has hosted hundreds of thousands of guests and there's no thoughts of replacing it. It's worn to the brown material gives you the confidence that this place is good at food. There are splotches of the actual red color and pattern design underneath places like the hostess podium, and under the tables themselves.   The walls are thick with a greasy film that oozes the flavors and aromas of dimsum past, present and future. You just don't want to have to lean against it, cuz somebody's uncle with way too much hair gel has leaned against that wall probably long before you were even a thought at a party.   The food is good. It's been cooked in the same oils as the dim sum progenetors intended. You can get some \"siew\" for your siew mai, some \"ha\" for your ha gow. If you've read my reviews before, there's a translation on what to get in other restaurant reviews.   The one thing that's new and different about this spot is the bbq pork filled bolo baos. \"bow (bow and arrow) low (get low) bao (take a bow)\" \"bow low bow\". Try it. you'll like it.",

Oh and I cannot forget the dao fu fa (sweet tofu dessert)!!!  It's my favorite! And if a dim sum spot has this, they are truly a winner!!!   I believe this place tastes close to the foods I had in Hong Kong so two thumbs up here!!! Also, I went here w/ my aunt and uncle during the busy Chinese New Year!!!

    "text": "Did you ever want to try a new restaurant that was rated pretty well and found out that you should whip out the ol' Blackberry and log onto the site just to heave the thing across the room in the hopes of watching the communicative device shatter into a glorious spectacle of plastic and debris? Well this was the case in the following review I'm about to \"drop\" on you!   The wife read about Chang's Hong Kong Cuisine that a \"Yelper\" had reviewed. We were planning a trip to Vegas and figured that we would try something different, as opposed to the usual buffets that we would normally head straight for. Innocently enough, we made a B-Line straight to Chang's once we arrived in Vegas and was anticipating a decent Dim Sum experience. Once we got there, we were left standing in the Foyer for a few minutes. During this time, I noticed that one of the servers arrived late from behind us and hadn't had the chance to clock in before she sat us. I just found that kinda funny and thought I would share this with you! =)   As the Brunch progressed, the wife got really tiffed because the best Chinese team, in terms of timing and follow-through, in the Dim Sum industry decided that they would all take the day off and allow the lack-luster, slow, and incompetent crew work a solid day. Whoa is me!   Service was slow, our tea order was really late, the food was sub-par, and most of all, my hot chili sauce was late! I loves me some hot chili sauce with my Dim Sum dumplins!  I think that the highlight of our experience was when my wife finally threw in the towel and flagged down a Chinese lady and berated her with God knows what! I couldn't tell you what she said but service surely improved from that point on! God I love feisty Chinese women!   The Dim Sum itself was not memorable and the chicken feet were like the worst things because it tasted breaded before braising.  It felt and tasted gummy.    The prices were great and its location was easy to find! It wasn't tucked in the corner of some sleezy shopping plaza that may be impossible to get into or out--to!   The final note from me is that, all in all, I will not go out of my way to come back here. I think the only way I would is if a friend clocked me over the head with a baseball bat (preferably metal..my head might shatter a wooden one then I'll be left cleaning the bits of splintered wood from the carpet with a headache! Who wants that?!) and bribe the paramedics to drop us off here rather than the Hospital. Maybe this way I wouldn't mind the mediocre tasting food, but I'd probably bleed out before I get my chili sauce! =(",

    "text": "Update: Downgrade one star after last week. We were there at 12 noon and a whole bunch of carts came swarming at us. As dim sum should be relaxing and chill, we did not order everything at one go. Unfortunately for us, those carts went back in the kitchen and never came back out. They said that if we wanted anything special we'd have to order it. That's just not dim sum. Sorry, not the place for our usual Saturday hang-out with this kind usual chinese style rudeness. I'm Chinese, I can say this.  Okay, I have to be fair. This place is better in selection and quality than Orchid Gardens but it still doesn't compare to that of Great Eastern in SF. But, this is Vegas and I am not going to compare with other cities (Vancouver, HK, China, Sydney..etc). For a Saturday fix, it's starting to be a tradition brunch spot for my husband, daughter, and I. Because, it has good standard dim sum. Come earlier to get the fresh selection. Otherwise, you'll end up with slim pickings near 1pm. Oh, that's COLD and slim... :).  Hubby's gripe: \"Bring on some real chili oil sauce and none of that chili sauce!\" (We're about to bring our own Lee Kum Kee Chili Oil Sauce).",

It isn't what I would call clean nor dirty.  Beyond that, though, I have many positive things I found. 1) Tea was good. 2) Food in general was good.  Some dimsum dishes were just perfect while others were good. 3) I like old cart style ;)  And this place does it the old way with ladies running around. 4) Service is fast.  Which is unusual for dimsum place. 5) Speaks decent English for dimsum standard.  Places in Los Angeles vicinity... I had to use sign languages at times... not here. 6) Price was very reasonable.  Cheap in fact with their weekday specials running low prices. Basically, party of 4 adults and 3 kids costed less than $50 including gratuity...  Now, that is value. Probably will swing there for tomorrow's lunch as well :)",

Everything else was so flavorful and hot.   After singing praises of it for months to our friends and family we brought them here February 2018 - TERRIBLE! HUGE decline in quality. Nothing was hot and lacked flavor. Do not come here. Will be trying out Other dim sum places next time. Maybe someone knows where the chef from October 2017 went?",

The ladies pushing the dim sum carts was ignoring our table they tend to go straight to the table who have Chinese people sitting in it. The waiters didn't bother to refill our water they never came back to our table at all I tried calling one of them but they pretend that they didn't hear me at all. I don't recommend this place their bad customer service pair up with their lukewarm dim sums.",

Only three carts circling.   Only three or four other tables occupied. Standard suspects, relatively warm, taste average.  Service gruff, but not much different than most Chinese places.  Price was higher than expected, though not outrageous.  What was I expecting?  Not sure, but it wasn't as satisfying as I would have hoped.  Then again, for midweek dim sum, perhaps I was deluded.",

We selected most of the basic items that were rolling around. I think there were only 2 carts...   Nothing about the dim sum sticks out to me, pretty average. I wish we would have came earlier for a better experience and greater selection.  I had called ahead asking what time they stopped serving, They supposedly stop serving dim sum around 3 so I guess late comers get what's left.  Will come back next time, I'll have to re-review when that time comes.",

I had some misgivings, but decided to try it again. I am glad I did.  Those who loved the old Chang's won't be disappointed.  The dim sum remains quite good and a fantastic bargain.  The food is very authentic, and a welcome break from the typical Strip fare.  I noticed most of the customers again seemed to be native speaking Chinese...always a good sign for authenticity.  And I guess that's how I put the negative reviews in context.  If you have ever eaten authentic dim sum ANYWHERE in the world, and you actually are complaining that the push cart ladies don't speak English....grow up, man.  The ladies almost never do.  Use sign language, or Google images as I did, to get your point across.   I wanted some turnip cakes, didn't see it in any of the carts, so I just flashed a photo and BAM, they brought out a freshly cooked plate.  The decor isn't much to speak of, and the service is what you expect.  But the food is quite good, and it won't break your wallet.",

    "text": "Chang's has always had a special place in my heart, it was my favorite for dim sum before I heard of KJ's.  I've recently paid a visit after hearing that they have some legit xiao long bao.   I came on a Thursday around noon with some friends and there was plenty of available sitting.  They offer complimentary tea my friend introduced me to pu-erh tea, which is a black tea.  It had a nice roasted, dark taste, if you're looking to try something other than jasmine or green tea.   There were 4 different carts roaming around the room.  We ordered the Shrimp Rice Roll, Chicken Feet (4 pieces), Shumai (4 pieces), Har Gow (4 pieces), Pork Spareribs, Turnip Cake, Egg Tarts, and Xiao Long Bao (large).   The XLB has a 20 minute wait time upon ordering.  They bring it out on a bamboo steamer accompanied with a red vinegar sauce.  The sauce isn't needed since there's soup inside.  It was nice and hot, but half of the XLB wasn't soupy enough.  Nice effort Chang's.  It's better than the tin pan things you get at KJ's for sure, but it doesn't quite satisfy my cravings.    Pricing is pretty reasonable, our bill came to $36 and left the three of us pretty satisfied.  Our servers took good care of us, and kept refilling our water and tea pot, which was nice and different from other Chinese restaurants.  I liked that their serving size for most dishes was 4 pieces, i'm used to seeing 3 pieces/dish at other places.    Bigger servings, better service, what more can you ask for during dim sum?!",

It took about 8 minutes to get a cart to actually stop bc I feel like we were not Asian so let's just skip our table completely. The food was bland, tasteless and expensive.

    "text": "They say finger pointing is bad, but if you're going for dim sum- finger pointing is great! You get to point at the food you want and bam! Hot and tasty pot stickers on your table! If you haven't had dim sum before, it is like a la cart Chinese steamed foods, but the food is actually pushed around in carts! The waiters roll around the carts that keep the food nice and hot around the room. You get a paper ticket (kind of like the one in Bingo) and they mark your card every time you pick something off their cart. Some carts are in Category A, which is like $3, Category B is like $4, and so on and so forth. Since everything is individual, you can get to try a lot of things without breaking the bank or feeling committed to eat the whole thing if you didn't like it.   The atmosphere is casual and in a way traditional. A fish tank and live lobsters swim on the left and there are a lot of big round tables for large family and friend gatherings. It's not a fancy place, but it is clean, welcoming, and the food has been consistently delicious. I usually get the rice roll filled with beef, but it comes in shrimp and pork too. They put a soy sauce on it that is slightly sweet and not as tangy as regular soy sauce. It compliments the meat very well. 3 come in an order. The shrimp har gow needs no soy sauce. It is a steamed dumpling filled with shrimp. It's light, flavorful, and 4 pieces come in an order. The Chinese meatball is also steamed and is another favorite for me. Tender and the hint of green onions really add to the taste. The beef tripe was also good. It is cooked with ginger, so that was different for me. It was not greasy and I would order it again. Steamed char siu buns are light and fluffy with a decent amount of bbq pork in the middle. Chicken feet was well marinated and chewy. It is boney though, but after all it is chicken feet. Lol. They also have hot rice congee, which is a thick rice porridge. Comforting and cooked low and slow with chicken broth for a good full bodied flavor. Be sure to order the Chinese donut to go with it too. It's a long cylindrical fried bread that you dip in the rice porridge to add an element of crunchy chewiness to the dish. Then, if you get there early enough you can get the egg custard tartletts from the dessert cart. The crust is buttery and flaky. The egg custard in the middle just melts in your mouth. A great way to end the meal. Be sure to order a pot of the chrysanthemum tea to round out the whole experience.  Service is great on top of everything. The waiters checked on how I was doing and consistently removed the empty metal trays as they were empty. The managers do a good job on making sure everyone is happy and keeping the carts full of fresh and hot food. The prices are very reasonable too. I will definitely be coming back again. Highly recommend!",

Here's what happened on my most recent experience at Chang's on a Tuesday just past the busy lunch hour:  * I sat for nearly 5 min with no server asking for water and hot tea or any of the dim sum carts around. Not a good sign.  * The shrimp har gow and beef tripe tasted very bland with no flavor at all. Not at all what I expect from any dim sum place. * Are you telling me at 1:00 on a Tuesday afternoon there are only 2 carts of dim sum available to choose from? Wow talk about lack of variety (and I pretty much lost my appetite after three dishes). * I overheard an elderly couple at another table voicing their frustration at their server that they had placed an order for sesame balls for the last 15 min and never got it and that they need to go. The server apologized and expedited their order in a to-go container. Didn't know if the server charged the order or not for the couple but still an unpleasant situation to be in.  Unless the management take note and make change towards improving their customer service and appeal of their business, I will most likely not return (not even for a special offer or discount).",

The table next to us, which had a larger party, came in about 30 minutes after us and started getting their food at a really fast pace and we were basically forgotten about. Our food stopped coming and we were barely approached. We decided to leave after an hour as we were short on time but the cashier was no where to be found. After about 5-10 minutes a woman who was sitting right next to where we were standing got up and went to the register.  The service and experience were horrible. Would not recommend going here especially if you don't mind waiting/eating for an hour or two.",

I was really offended by the forks.   Looked around, I see people with forks, sodas, cold water glasses, hot mustard, tables with no tea, and people actually ordering the plates of noodles (the stuff you never buy at dim sum.)   Not to sound racist but I saw mostly white and Filipino people in here. Maybe some Hawaiians. I felt like the only Chinese. Did not hear anybody say Jo-san.  What the hell is going on? There are a lot of non-Chinese yelping going on too. Lot's of 5 stars, that's weird.   You know if a Chinese restaurant is good if there are bad ratings for things like: -rude dim sum cart ladies -or they forgot my water, -or they forgot my hot mustard,  -they don't have orange chicken -they don't speak english -there's leaves in my tea -they circle dishes of food around my face saying, \"you want this teriyaki bullshit on plate?\"   Really forks?",

There's a lot of communication difficulties, I asked for mayonnaise (of course) and she kept thinking I wanted a menu.

I am not fluent in Chinese, so I would recommend going with someone who is fluent with the language or familiar with dim sum items. You can't go wrong with pork shumai or shrimp hargo. The bbq buns have this delicious honey coating on top. Of course, that makes it stick to your chopsticks, but other than that, it's awesome!    I've also come here for dinner several times. I love this one tofu dish with scallops.  The last time we went (which was for my friend's birthay dinner, we ordered 2 orders of the dish. They crammed it into one dish, and we felt like they didn't give us the full two orders. I also love the crispy noodles where they pour sauce on top of the noodles to makes the noodles softer. I have never had bad service here. They are always attentive, and I love the food here!",

Think this is slightly more than I've usually spent at dim sum places, but by only a couple of bucks at most. You have all your typical dim sum choices. Nothing really stood out to me. A negative is that no one came by to refill our water cups. That was disappointing. Other than that, it was a good meal.",

They might need to cook this a bit longer.  Sticky Rice: The sticky rice was cooked a bit too long that the rice was slightly soggy but I liked the filling. It had variety of different meats.  Congee: Consistency is ok but they don't have enough pork or thousand year old egg in it. Pretty good.  Chinese Donut: I like how they make this one at a time so that any person who wants it, gets it fresh. It was crispy and warm. After giving it to us, they went back to the kitchen to get another one. That's good that they do that so that people get it fresh.  Pineapple Bun: I don't care for the bun because it's the same bun as they use for the bbq pork sweet bun. The filling is ok but not the best.  Spring Roll: The meat inside the spring roll was slightly mushy but the spring roll was really crispy.  Egg Tart: This was good too. It came out warm and the custard part was flaky.  Shrimp Dumpling: This is a good dish. The skin wasn't thick and it's not a large dumpling.   Bean Curd Roll: This dish needs a good sauce. This was pretty good and the filling was tender.  Service was good. There's a lot of people pushing carts around and they also make sure you get the freshest dishes. There's also people picking up dishes too when you're done so you have space to get more food.  The restaurant is large. They have enough space for large groups.  Overall, pretty good food. I'll definitely come back here again.",

The let down was the food temperatures; everything was cold.  The dim sum variety was good offering the basics plus they had plates of noodles, bowls of fried sticky rice and Chinese donuts for the porridge.  All nice offerings.  While some cart servers were friendly, some were not.  The table servers were attentive.    Cold dim sum makes for a bad experience.",

I don't remember all the names of the items, but some of the usual suspects are pork hash, char siu bau, shrimp balls, tripe, bean curd, taro puffs, scallop rolls...and many more. Everything I've had was tasty and nothing to complain about.   The service is hit and miss though. You have to ask for refills and small things like utensils and hot sauce. Sometimes the staff can come off rude but I don't pay much attention unless someone is blatantly yelling in my face. The interior is a bit outdated and not the cleanest, and parking can be tough during the lunch rush. Overall I would visit again while vacationing in Vegas.",

She had no clue..because she didn't put the order in! She didn't even check up on us and our food took such a long time.

I load up anything that remotely appears to have beef peering through its doughy cocoon.  Some of it tasty. Some, not very. Who cares. This is an experiment in eating as far as I'm concerned.  The tray comes around on timed intervals (it seems), only, the second time, I lose track of my first-round selections. I needed a plan. Methodically, I started at one end of the cart, sampling one of everything. Five rounds later, I'd had enough. I spit half the shit out in my napkin. (Anthony Bourdain I'm not).  The stuff that WAS good, was really good. Only I forgot which pieces were repeaters.  This shit is really confusing for a Dim Sum novice.  The desserts were tasty too, but I can't tell you what I ate. It was sweet with a weird texture.  This was an exceptional experience I will repeat, but I'm going to have to be severely fucked-up before doing so.

Their service was actually much better than what I have read from other Yelpers. The cashier lady even wishes me Happy New Year when I left.   However, you have to avoid their rush hours, which is weekend during lunch time, or you will have to wait for a long time.

I have seen returned several times and find the service to be consistently efficient.  The servers handling the cart will be happy to explain in broken english what is what.  4.  Food - Awesome. Great selection, well cooked, plenty of traffic which ensures a good flow of fresh food.  They have all my favorites here and my kid's favorites as well.  5.  Price - Very reasonable.  6.  Cart Frequency - The movement of the cart to get what you want or to even catch them by waving is a bit off.  Worth it to dome here and sample everything!",

    "text": "Gone out with the BF and my two Yelpalicious two- Angela H. and Elnino F. for some lunchie munchies.  We ordered   *Shumai (3x)- pretty decent, juicy. *Shrimp Har Gow- filling was fresh, but the dumpling skins stuck together...meh. *cheong fun w/ shrimp- these are rolled rice (noodle) rolls...the rolled rice was good but, it only had 2 shrimps in each and I'm used to more filling...these are my favorite so I was kinda sad panda. These were just steamed, not steamed then stir fried w/ sesame that I'm used to, but okay, I like this version too. It just was okay overall... *douchi spare ribs- I love pork and I love black beans. Though you order these anywhere and they are bony, it's all about the flavor and these were good.  *Fried Rice, sticky style- I thought this was good, but my buddy thought it was just plain fried rice....it was misleading since I thought all the sticky rice comes in leafs. Really, where's the lotus leaf wrapping?! It taste better that way when it picks up the subtle flavors. It had peanuts, dried shrimp, mushrooms, sliced pork.  *Fried shrimp w/mayo (2x)- it's shrimp, its fried wrapper, it's mayo...what is not to like?  *Hom Sui Gok-ground pork, the thick layer of mochi like wrapper and the crunch of the outside being fried makes for a nice texture meld. There was something missing though in the flavor of the filling that I couldn't quite place. *Black Bean Clams- these were in a good sauce, but was just okay. the clams were sparse and most of the shells were empty without the meat somewhere on the plate. WTF?! Most expensive dish at $7.95 and not worth it.   That came to $37 and overall, it was a decent meal. So now why 2 stars?  Firstly, it's a hot day, and it was a bit stuffy in there....they need some better A/C and/or more fans around the place. Our drinks were pretty neglected and we had to keep trying to flag people for water (there aren't that many servers and a cart lady ain't gonna stop to get you some). We got one refill in our small water cups and we were pretty dehydrated.   Now I know that sometimes servers say things that assume \"guilao\" don't know things, but it's usually said in a manner that is matter-of-fact, trying to be helpful and making sure the person doesn't feel awkward not knowing something. The first cart lady was rude and I did not like how she was talking to Angela H. like she was a fucking idiot when she knows well enough to order with proper names of foods. No, you do not need to point at which is har gow and shumai, she ordered it with those names, so I'm sure you don't need to teach a bitch holding chopsticks. We're not that white, jeez. The kicker is another cart lady came by and the lady was pointing and talking about our table. We aren't idiots and know it's talking shit about us since it's blatant, but you also don't know that my brothers are Chinese. Yeah, thanks for the hospitality so a nice wish for you; ham gaa fu gwai. This is said with much sarcasm if the obvious isn't obvious enough. One thing to treat people like guilao and think we need to be told something or given forks automatically, but another when we are treated as yang guizi. It is NOT acceptable to discriminate and belittle customers.    I feel this is somewhat a limited selection of offerings, but alas I was spoiled with a imperial selection in LA. It's hard not to compare to how awesome it was back home, so I try my best to minimize the comparisons because I will always set myself for a bad day.  I was looking for \"common\" items like dan tat (egg tarts) or siew yuk (crispy skinned roast pork) and they seem to not have it so I could not help be disappointed and think of home. Maybe they run out of the good stuff fast (we were there at 1pm-ish) , but hell I'm not waking up to beat the church goers and the club people. And I certainly have less patience when I can't get food AND water. Bring a drink if you're a group of white/non Chinese basically.   I am still on the mission to try all the (limited) dim sum places and find the \"best\" of Vegas....even though it'll probably be mediocre to home.  For Chang's though, I came to one conclusion- though we have a limited selection of dimsum spots here, I am not that desperate to come back unless with all my Chinese family and they suggest it (not likely gonna happen- they're from California).",

I really like their Steamed Chicken, Walnut Shrimp, and their Daily soup. Their prices are really reasonable and food tastes authentic. The only downside is that the restaurant is not centrally located and poorly lit at night so when we drive by, we often miss it and need to turn back. Then when you pull into the driveway, the reflective windows at night looks so dark that I thought the restaurant is closed, if not for the neon sign that says OPEN. I give this place a 4 star because the food and service are good consistently.",

The water tasted like crap, there was a hair in the water. And Let's just say we will NEVER be going back. And remember that word of mouth is also help especially with places like this.  And because of the rudeness, people will know how horrible it is.  3rd visit, we ordered out.. and threw it in the trash because it was the most disgusting taste ever.

    "text": "Well, had lunch here Sunday, and it was fine.  I think the offerings from one dim sum restaurant to the next are generally the same (har gow, siu mai, pai gut, fung zao, et al), with the probability of the cooks in the back wanting to make a dish other restaurants don't have, which is a good thing for competition.  I got in around 10:45-ish and was immediately seated, asked what beverage(s) I wanted and started to order away.  I notice the siu mai skin was thinner here than at Harbor Palace; for me that's neither good nor bad, just a difference.  The one thing I should have ordered but didn't was the you tiao (\"Chinese doughnuts\") that are served with jook.  It's, what, a foot of dough fried until golden brown and delicious?  I wasn't getting any jook, and I haven't had you tiao for ages.  At least I know where I can get some quick, since I live down the road from them.  I like the ambiance/feel of the place; it's a more subdued feel, and more \"modern,\" as opposed to HP, which I know has been in operation since at least 2002, when I first went there.  (Not to bash anyone, but in time the luster and sheen of Chang's will fade, too.)  I guess the owners wanted that pavilion vibe, which I can totally dig.  Unfortunately, the windows look out onto the parking lot outside; but, I still give them credit.  And, it was good to see that not only were the typical Asians there, but also whites and blacks, which always helps demystifying the culture.  I'm going to give Chang's the same rating as HP, because I feel the food and service were equally the same.  Chang's is a good place that's not too far from the Strip and serving the locals.",

The desserts were great as well, this is the only dim sum place I've been to which offered sweet rice cake, which I love, and the egg custard was awesome as well, with a nice flaky crust and rich egg filling.

Chang's was so good I went back the next day to get more.  Now, for the older generation asian folks you may think it's only so-so but I think Chang's is pretty darn good for a city like Las Vegas that has a smaller Chinese community.    I loved the authentic atmosphere of the place.  Everyone spoke Chinese and waitresses (in good o' trolley carts) were friendly.  Service was fast (I like to get my hot sauce when I ask for it) and the place was clean (for an Asian place).  I love that it was packed even at 2pm because it just adds to the upbeat atmosphere.    Another bonus is that this place is decently priced.  I don't remember exactly how many dishes my friend and I had but the bill came to around $21 w/o tax and we had ate to our heart's content.    This place is only 2 miles from the strip so I would recommend any tourists to check this out, especially if you're looking for some authentic Chinese food.  Restaurants on the strip are pricey and it's only for show (the food usually isn't great for how much you're paying).",

He asked his lady where the best DS place is and her prompt response was \"Changs on Trop and Decatur\".    Side note: She knows what she is talking about a) she is full Asian (I am only .5) b)she is a host to Asian hi-rollas and c)she used to live here and has good taste in food.  So imagine our surprise when we drove up to Changs and it was the place we had been before!  Yesss!!  There was no wait (it was about 2:30 pm) so we got seated immediately.  We had delicious shu mai, har gow, sticky rice, cha seu bao,  shrimp in the long white noodle (rolled up and cut with scissors), the sticky rice in banana leaves and I got a hankering for jook  and it did not disappoint!

Our friend ordered for us and I loved everything except the short ribs.  A little too shy on meat and flavor.  The chinese brocolli was divine.

This place opens at 10:30am on the weekend. I was there for Dim Sum right when it opened. The food was great. A lot of the pastries like the Sesame Balls, Barbeque Pork Pies were fresh out of the oven and hot! Those were GREAT!!! Seriously I didn't realize the difference, but if I can make a comparison. Cookies fresh from the oven are WAY better than ones sitting around, so were the Sesame Balls. The Sui Mai was fresh too, but I think the chicken feet were a little over done. That was the only bad thing I have to say.  The Good: Very close to the strip by taxi  Walking distance from The Orleans Casino Good Authentic Dim Sum Inexpensive Decent/Friendly Service (is that possible at Dim Sum?)  The Bad: No taxi's readily in the area to get you back to the strip. If you walk to The Orleans for a taxi the neighborhood gets a little slummy.",

    "text": "My husband, daughter and I decided to try a different dim sum place other than the usual Orchids Garden Chinese Restaurant on Sahara so when headed over to Chang's Hong Kong Cuisine on Decatur, after all, it's been much talked about by so many of our friends.  It was hard to say whether this place was much better or much worse than our usual.  Some of the dim sum items tasted similar to Orchid's and some of them tasted different with a little change in one or two ingredients in the mix.  For instance, I prefer their shrimp har gau over Orchid's, but I rather enjoy Orchid's wrapped rice over Chang's.  What wasn't so good at Chang's was their dim sum items on the carts that didn't carry the steam baskets of goodness.  The eggplant, fried shrimp, all the items on plates that weren't steamed were served to us COLD!  Now if that isn't a kill to the palate, then I don't know what is!  Ugh!  Very displeasing, for sure!  No one expects food to be served cold like that.  We had lunch during the peak business lunch hour, but were seated immediately.  The ambiance is quite different from that of Orchids, possibly due to the popularity of the place.  I'm sure Chang's is very well received in the neighborhood, by how busy the place was; busy, meaning \"noisy.\"  But, of course, I expect no less at any Chinese restaurant.  (Although, once again, I have to compare this to Orchid's lack of noisiness, thus, the lack of popularity, per se?)  Do not hesitate to wave down a server pushing their carts around.  This, by no means, means you are rude and disrespectful to them.  It's just the way of the land at many Chinese restaurants.  They have no notion of this as being rude in any way, so wave away!  It was the only way we could dine at the pace we wanted anyway...=o)  I gave them a 3-star rating because their food was good, albeit, some not served at the right temperature.  The service was to be expected.  The ambiance was nice to experience, and it was good to know people enjoy frequenting the place.  But, I have to say that I'm partial to Orchid's and probably won't go back to Chang's again.  We can get our dim sum closer to where we live at the similar price and taste that Chang's has to offer us.  Happy Eats to All!",

    "text": "My friend dragged me to this place when I was really not in the mood for dim sum. I'm glad he did as we ended up having a great meal. There was plenty of variety and everything was very affordable. The food was traditional Hong Kong style dim sum. They didn't try too many fusion dishes or try to put anything not usually served at dim sum. It was nothing innovative, but still very good. The usual caveats of Chinese restaurant apply. Most of the tables are big. Our group of 4 got sat at a table that could have easily sat 8-10. Also, your hot tea will always be refilled, but good luck getting ice water.  I went back again with relatives a few weeks later. It was not as great of an experience. I think part of it was because we arrived too early. The carts all had the same items. By the time we were leaving, some of the items I had remembered from my first visit started coming out. I'd recommend this place, but don't come too early, although that may be difficult because they get very busy.",

Dirty walk-paths, faded spots, and most of it's threadbare. The architecture is really odd, too. I actually laughed out loud after having to walk in a spiral to get into the bathroom.  Other than that, the hostesses suck, the service sucks, and they didn't want to offer the white guy and black lady anything non-pedestrian. It was like pulling teeth to get the congee cart to stop at our table. I might go back in a pinch, but probably not.",

    "text": "Hmmm, this place is a little difficult for me to review to be honest. My wife and I were treated to this place by my father-in-law and his girlfriend, both of whom have had prior experience ordering dim sum. I expect this is why our experience was a bit more positive than some of the other reviews I've read on yelp. It does kind of help if you have an idea of what you are ordering ahead of time since many of the dishes taste different then they actually look.  We got there at exactly 10:30 and managed to get a table just fine, but fairly quickly the restaurant started to fill up with large families. I'm told that this is fairly usual here and that you should expect to wait for awhile if you get there much later than that.   Ok, time for the food. I can't recall half the stuff we ended up ordering, but I do remember that many of the dumplings and buns went down really well with our group. The pork buns, shrimp dumplings, vegetable dumplings all were pretty tasty. The pork buns were especially good, bigger and more full of meat than most chinese restaurants I've been too. Egg rolls were pretty much the standard stuff, but the fried shrimp balls were quite tasty (I feel weird saying that for some reason, lol). The rice was tasty, a bit sticky and moist with lots of stuff mixed in. The one item that completely shocked the table on how yummy  it was was the homemade sweet tofu. Very yummy, my wife ended up getting a second bowl.  Something to keep in mind though is that it takes time for the waiters to bring out all the carts. We noticed that at around 11:30, just as we were finishing up, the waiters were bringing out the more savory meat dishes and so on. Kind of annoying, but makes me think that next time I come I'll have to plan on either taking my sweet time with my meal or come a little later and deal with the wait. All in all it was an enjoyable meal, but going as a group really ended up helping because we got to sample more and had plenty of good conversation going. Also, I got to watch my wife try eating chicken feet... *snicker*",

Weeks before my birthday I made a reservation for my party in the small room.  I watched the reservation written down by David and was confirmed for a small family party.  Just to be sure, I came in 6 days before the party and was again assured that my reservation was all set.  We came in today for the party and David, the same guy that took my reservation, claimed that we had no reservation.  The story continued to change (that we needed a deposit; That we had not confirmed that reservation - basically lying).  The manager, David is a sneaky, slimy piece of work.  After enough yelling, David inconveniencing my family, and ruining my birthday party - we were moved into the room.  He was incredibly rude to my mother, who showed up 15 minutes earlier than I had and never said sorry to me.    long story short: I went above and beyond to confirm my reservation and the managers at Changs lied point-blank and were rude and slippery.  Don't go there - the food wasn't even good today - you are better off at Orchid Gardens.",

    "text": "This is a nice place to go for dim sum Sunday brunch. It's pretty busy at lunchtime on Sundays but we've always manages to get seated immediately.  Their shumai and bao are delicious. Chicken feet, anyone? Yum! The carts are constantly going around and if a dish you request isn't on a cart, they'll usually inform you how many minutes before it gets back on. The ladies pushing the carts are pretty helpful. Some may speak hardly any English but they will try to explain to you, if you ask, what the dishes are. Keep the paper for food tally easily accessible to servers on your table. The ladies will come and stamp your food order on it and then you'll take it to the window by the entrance when you're done to pay for the meal.   The food is relatively cheap and most orders are under $5 so I never had to ask how much each dish costs. Make sure to ask for large glasses of water or they will bring you tiny ones. They might come and check if you need a tea refill but if you happen to run out, just signal for more by turning over the tea pot lid or propping it ajar. This works some times.  Their service has been significantly better than other dim sum places I've visited. Service at a Chinese restaurant? That's huge.",

    "text": "Chinese dum sum style restaurant where servers actually wheel around carts of steamed/cooked appetizer sized dishes where you pick out what foods you want on your table. Depending on what you pick, you get stamped for the dish on a price category and in the end, the cashier just adds up the prices of all the stamps on your card. Typically, dim sum is a breakfast/brunch meal.  The place is pretty dark but gets pretty darn busy brunch time area when people are out of church and what not. It's great for families because food choices are flexible and tables are all round seating at least 4+. You really don't have to wait for food that long cos carts are always moving around. BUT, service here is not that prompt and I constantly had to flag down buspeople to refill the tiny water glasses, get chili sauce, or have napkins (to which they only gave me 3). I usually feel bad bugging people, but no one really checked on how we're doing and I know asking the cartspeople won't help much cos they're busy carting food.  Craving dim sum?  Atmosphere is alright. Service is subpar.  But this place has msot of the classic staples of shu mai, pork spare ribs, chicken feet, shrimp dumplings, congee, and more. Expect grease and oils of chinese food and lots of sodium, but it's a guilty pleasure that my family and I can't let go of just yet :)",

    "text": "The Las Vegas strip is a great place to eat, even if you want Asian food. There are Chinese buffets galore as well as a number of new Korean restaurants (including the nearby Kim Chee Restaurant and at least two others just north of the Stratosphere). But what is really impressive is the string of great oriental food palaces located west of the strip on the street called Spring Mountain, between Sahara and Flamingo.   The banquet begins just a few blocks from the casinos. Start with the first large restaurant that you come to driving west, Satay Malaysian Grille. It offers an exotic selection of Southeast Asian and Singapore fare, a mix of Thai and Indian flavors, spicy, sweet and savory good. Try the traditional Satay, the shrimp and papaya salad, and the Laksa, highlighted with peanut sauce, coconut milk, and shellfish. Continuing down the street are a number of Chinese marketplaces peppered with great little eating places. If you seek the familiar there is even a Sam Woo's Barbeque, with its delicious pork, duck and noodle dishes. For fish and crab try Seafood Harbor. For Korean try the Sweet Pig. If Vietnamese Pho noodle soup is your preference there are half a dozen little joints all in the same area.   One Chinese treat that I found especially satisfying was the Dim Sum at Chang's Hong Kong Cuisine on Decatur, about ten blocks south of Spring Mountain, just north of Tropicana. Chang's is located in a white Chinese style building on the east side of the street. The day that I went there, on a Thursday, the place was packed with locals, mostly Chinese. They had one of the best sticky rice in lotus leaves that I have ever had, and their fun rolls (rice noodle) were delicious too. The prices were right, with most dim sum dishes costing between $1.75 and $2.50, substantially lower than the average place in LA. I did not eat at Chang's Hong Kong Cuisine for dinner, but I took a look at the menu and it offered a fine array of traditional Hong Kong/Cantonese style dishes at reasonable prices.   So the next time you are in Vegas, don't forget to try the flavors of California's favorite Chinatown in Nevada, Spring Mountain Blvd in Las Vegas, and Chang's Hong Kong Cuisine for Dim Sum, seven days a week located at 4670 S. Decatur Blvd. Las Vegas, NV 89103, phone: (702) 362-3663.",

The ladies would come by with the cart, no explanation of what we were seeing on the cart and unable to answer questions.  I'm sure the food is good, but it's super awkward if you don't know how the whole thing works and what you're looking at.  They need to ask customers if you've been there before, explain what's going on and how to find out what the food is that's circulating.  With labels in English on the carts, we would've been able to see what we were doing.  Instead we left money on the table for tea we didn't drink and left.  The staff smiled at us as we left.  Something's missing here.",

I would definitely recommend my family and friends to come here! BTW TRYING THE SHRIMP NOODLE ROLLS IS A MUST!",

Second Breakfast:  Chang's Hong Kong Cuisine  Note - the restaurant has been under new ownership since 2017.  Quality has improved.  Summary - Best of the bunch and the best in Vegas for everyday dim sum.  Har Gao Benchmark - Very thin, translucent, highly glutinous crystal skin with near perfect  moisture content and chew.  Shrimp within a good blend of previously frozen paste and pieces, well seasoned, MSG evident.  Service - Carts with special items direct from the kitchen.  Price - In line.  Inexpensive.  Authenticity - 80% Asian.  Many misspellings in the menu.  Selection - Large.  All the standards plus more.  Shu mai - Good blend of coarse finely ground pork and shrimp with lots of crab eggs on top adding complexity.  MSG evident.   Steamed BBQ pork bun - Fluffy and fresh with sparse but intensely seasoned, sweet filling. Mochi rice in Lotus leaf - Smaller than most allowing the flavor of the leaf to penetrate throughout.  Lots of savory pork and duck egg within. Chicken feet - Tender with almost no chew to the skin.  Over seasoned. Beef tripe - Fall apart tender.  Very pronounced ginger flavor.  Very good. Fried turnip cake - Light and puffy.  Neutral flavor.  Crisp on the outside.  Somewhat oily. Egg tart - Fresh, flaky with lots of lard.  Well controlled sweetness of the custard.  Edges out the competition in freshness and flavor.",

It's near the new years and they're busy.   However, what IS the cause of my one star rating is their lack of transparency/ honesty towards us. When they first informed us of the lack of certain items we were understanding. But even after we ordered the foods and confirmed that the foods were in stocks, we didnt get them. It turns out that they had run out and did not inform us. Towards the end of our meal, we asked about our missing items to confirm that they would not be listed to which the waiter agreed.   We finally pay the check but upon a closer inspection, our check was too high. The check was in chinese and because we were korean, the waiter insisted that the food item was not on the check. Both of my parents knew some chinese and clearly spotted that it was included in the check. Instead of refunding the item, the waiter continued to deny the facts. After a few minutes, the owner helped us get a refund  I dont know if this is a common occurance but after driving 6 hours it is a pretty frustrating thing to experience.",

The food was delicious,  and the choices were excellent.  The restaurant was clean (for a Chinese restaurant,  anyways) and the service was very good...except for a very poor attitude from the manager,  who is very rude, unhelpful,  and certainly hasn't graduated at the top of his class in customer service. He wasn't mean but seemed put out by simple requests like asking for a menu (to order noodles from the kitchen) or for hot mustard (he said \"we don't have any\" but we later asked a busboy and he quickly brought us some). This manager/owner needs to get an attitude adjustment or stay the hell home because he's bad for business. We're not the only ones who complain about this guy since we've spoken with others who have had similar bad service experiences with this manager.  Other than that, we love Chang's food!!",

Thanks to Jean C, my Vegas Yelp connection, for telling me about Chang's. I loved the atmosphere. The restaurant was buzzing with Cantonese, and it felt like I was in a tea house in Hong Kong. The hostess asked me if I needed a fork! I guess being an ABC is really that obvious. But no thank you, I can handle the sticks just fine.  This restaurant is not in Chinatown. It is a standalone building about 3 miles south of Chinatown, and a short Uber ride from Mandalay Bay. The building is nice, and I preferred it over the typical strip center or having to navigating through the Gold Coast to get to Ping Pang Pong (although I really like it there). The dining room is perfect size. It is big enough that you don' t feel overcrowded, but also not one of those oversized rooms that hosts gigantic wedding banquets. The hostess told me that the restaurant has been open for many years but it changed owners this year.  Dim Sum as a single person is not ideal because you might not try as many dishes as you would with a group. But that doesn't stop me. I ordered tripe, pai qwat, gai lan, shark's fin dumpling, and shrimp balls on mushrooms. I was a little disappointed that I didn't see more unique dim sums, but their execution of these traditional items was well above average. I recommend Chang's for Dim Sum and I would definitely come back.",

The ladies and carts come around fairly regularly. Menu is available to special order entree items or things that aren't in stock on the carts. Some of the better items we tried here were the fried smelt, the pork buns, and the various dumplings. I'm a big fan of salt and pepper shrimp and though these were cooked well, they weren't as seasoned as I prefer. I do like how the dumplings, shu mai, and other small items were sized a bit bigger here than elsewhere. Overall, food quality was good.  Service was friendly. We had tables reserved, which helped as there was a wait after about 11AM on a Sunday. Pricing was reasonable, and our large group received a discount for their grand opening. I don't go out for dim sum often, but I will consider coming back to Chang's next time I get a craving.",

We're on the other side of town but we brave the distance just to satisfy our craving for good, authentic Chinese food. Since we are regulars, we often interfaced with the original owners and their customer service has always been excellent. Saw many changes when new management took over. Food remained commendable, tho, so we still come to this place but not as often as before. However, today, we got an incredible response from a server when we requested for some measures to keep a hovering fly from touching base with our food, even suggesting a lighted candle. And he goes, \"We don't have any, and even if we do, I can't take it out for you.\" I insisted on him doing something about the fly and he responded, \"There is nothing we can do about that. We have to call the Department of Health for them to address the situation.\" Wow! That was the most laughable and unbelievable response I've ever heard especially from a food server!  My instinct was to jump up and leave immediately but my husband was so hungry after fasting for a medical procedure so we stayed on but had to cover three dishes with napkins to keep the fly from going into our food! What a way to have dinner!  I'm posting a photo of the server. Management should look into this.",

There was not a huge selection of carts, but almost everything we had was up to dim sum standards and great. The shrimp balls were excellent, and the \"deep fried dumplings\" were amazing--we think they had pork in them, but either way they were great. Definitely easy, delicious, and very typical for dim sum. We will definitely go there again, but it wasn't quite as good as our Chinatown place we used to go to in Atlanta.",

I tried three dishes each one was no better than microwave dim sum. I had an order of shiu mai, har gow and rice noodle roll with shrimp. I would have given 1 star on taste alone but the staff was very attentive and friendly. I spoke to a young asian couple at the table next to me and I was asking them if there were any other GOOD dim sum places in Vegas. They sadly said Chang's was as good as it gets. They did mention another place that I had also seen on Yelp the night before when I was researching dim sum places to try. that place was Orchids Garden. Since breakfast was so disappointing maybe I will try Orchids for lunch. TO BE CONTINUED....",

It is a good sign when you walk into a restaurant and it is full of asian people.  That means it's good.  Service was great.  The cart ladies came around all the time.  Everything we had tasted good.  Better than not having any Dim Sum at all.   Don't order the Siew Long Pau.  The skin was thick.  Save your money on something else.

If you make the slightest effort to speak Chinese, the waitresses (who are mostly from Guangdong but all speak at least okay Mandarin and can definitely understand all the rudimentary things I can say) will fawn all over you and be your buddies forever.   I don't even want to try describing the best dishes because I won't even scratch the surface.  Just go during lunch on a weekday, order a ton of food, and say I was right.",

    "text": "Just got back from a trip to Vegas for my husbands BDay.  My husband loves dim sum so I  searched yelp for a decent dim sum place to take him.  This was my first official dim sum experience (with the carts).We both loved it.  We went on a Saturday right at 10:30 when they opened, the place is nice ,nothing fancy  but didn't notice anything dirty about it.  We had one of the first tables in the middle right by where the carts come out of the kitchen and they would all stop by us first with all of the fresh food.  Service was actually good (maybe because it was at the beginning of the day!) Both myself and my husband commented that it was some of the best service that we have had in a Chinese restaurant.   There were probably 6 carts and all of the women were nice and opened the dishes to show us what they had and tried their hardest to explain what each dish was.  Luckily my husband and myself kind of knew what we were looking for, you may have a hard time figuring out what is what if you don't know dim sum.  The women are usually only able to tell you what meat or filling a dish had, however, they do have quite a few pictures on their website if you need help.   Some dishes we had: shrimp har gow (good), sil myl (very good), pork dumpling (good) baked BBQ pork bao (very good) , veggie egg roll (good), meatball (very good) sesame ball (good) baked egg bao(good)  beef rice noodle roll (least favorite, not a lot of flavor, the only dish we didn't finish) and my favorite the baked sweet bun (very good, like a Hawaiian sweet roll with sugar crumb coating....OH YUM!).     Our total came to $25 and we were stuffed.  We loved it and will definitely come back when we visit Vegas again.  My husband even mentioned stopping by on Sunday  on our way out of town!",

I said, \"there are only 6 adults and 4 children.\" He (I believe the owner) just shrouded his shoulders and said, \"that's our service charge.\" $19.25!!!! - that's an extreme charge for servicing water refills and collecting empty dim sum containers.

By 1130, the restaurant was hopping and I felt better that there were others enjoying their Dim Sum.  This restaurant was located on S Decatur Blvd between W Harmon Blvd and W Tropicana Blvd in Las Vegas.  I asked for the Hot Chili Pepper Oil and an older gentleman brought me a small dish.  I actually prefer this to the communal container which is traditionally on the table.  There were 4 dishes that really stood out here:  Sticky Rice in Lotus Leaf: There were large chunks of Chinese Mushoom, Chinese Sausage, and Shrimp.  The filling wasn't all ground up.  This has been the best \"Chinese Tamale\" so far out of the 4 Dim Sum Houses I have tried in Las Vegas.  BBQ Pork Pie:  The 3 triangular pies were large and so flaky.  I loved the glistening of the egg wash.  The BBQ pork was sweet with large chunks.  My husband would love these.  Baked Sweet Custard Bun:  The outside was crusty, the bun was so soft.  The custard was thick and a little on the sweet side.  Baked Custard Tarts:  Light flaky crust, creamy custard.  Good sized.  Everything else was average.  The Shrimp Rice Noodle had 2 rolls with a total of 6 good sized shrimp.  The server cut the rolls into 6 pieces and poured a sweet soy sauce over the noodles.  There were no scallions or anything in the rolls besides the shrimp.  The 4 Siu Mai had pale orange eggs on top and were luke warm coming from a steaming cart.  Perhaps yesterday's leftovers?  The 4 Har Gow had a very delicate outer noodle.  It tore as I tried to pick up a dumpling.  There were whole pieces of shrimp with chopped bamboo shoots.  The 3  Deep-fried glutinous rice dumpling with pork (Haam Sui Gau): were okay, but not outstanding.  They were warm, not hot.  I asked a server for the Don Tot (Baked Custard Tarts).  She said maybe later.  I did not see any Shark Fin Dumpling or Steamed Pork Ribs in Black Bean Sauce.  There was a young boy going around refilling tea.  My empty plates were cleared frequently.  The service was better here than at other Dim Sum Houses.  There were a few English speaking people like the young girl who brought me the Sticky Rice with Lotus Leaf.  As I went up to the cash register to pay, a server brought me a tray of Don Tot.  I bought one order which had the usual 3 pieces.  I will be back.",

Undoubtedly a gluttonous meal but one priced competitively to that of KJ or Cathay House with food on par with the former and far superior to the second as items felt to be 'too old' by servers were twice delayed until fresh versions could be procured from the kitchen it was with a wide swath and steady pacing that we cut our path through a selection of over fifty options and with only the overly thick wrapper of the har gow and oily pan-fried mixed dumplings proving less than impressive to my tooth an 88% batting average was still quite impressive for any dim sum spot, let alone one situated well outside of Chinatown on an industrial stretch of South Decatur.  Having already spoke to the quality of the crispy roast duck and snappy prawns finding skillful balance between cream and crunch beneath a milky sweet sauce it should generally go without saying that freshest items proved the strongest options throughout our meal and with the herb-tinged congee a personal favorite along with molten baked custard buns I'd be remiss to not also mention a pair of novelties that proved equally impressive, the first featuring steamed egg custard topped with tender shrimp in an umami-laden broth and the second a delectable Red Bean Bun delivered  as a sticky golden spin on the cinnamon roll with a slight-savory finish bridging the classic Chinese ingredient to a Western palate in a way that many traditional Dim-Sum 'sweets' do not.",

    "text": "Was visiting Vegas from Palm Springs area, where there is no dim-sum to speak of. So, we got adventurous and tried to find the best, most reasonable one that wouldn't have an 1 1/2 hour wait since it was Memorial Day weekend. We got there about 1/2 hour after they opened and snagged one of the last empty tables - long line formed after that. Good selection of the usual suspects and we even tried some that we couldn't identify or figure out. One hit and one miss, but that's part of the adventure, right? Overall, it was dim sum - oily, questionable origins of meat product, and lots of salt and flavors to enhance the food. Exactly what to expect from a dim-sum:-)",

Today we came late, around 2pm. Only two carts circling. Basically had to order what we wanted but had trouble finding our waiter to do so. No refilling our water glasses.

The fried meatball-The inside looked like dog food and worse it tasted like they were sanitizing and cleaning while cooking- it had a taste of windex. The gentlemen going around were very nice but the dim sum ladies were actually very rude and neglectful. They would drive around our table and bump us and one lady even dropped all the food inside her cart and continued to walk by. Tried to flag down a lady who seem to be running the place and she gestured erratically and saying \"no no no\"  come realize she couldnt speak english.

    "text": "That's sum nice food.  Chang's Hong Kong Cuisine is a lone wolf with its own parking lot and no neighbors. Located on Decatur Ave north of Tropicana, this seemingly timeless dim sum / Chinese establishment has an interior that's very reminiscent of similar venues in other states which I've been to so often for weekend meals and wedding receptions. I was advised that this was the better of two options which I was considering, so I brought my parents here for a Memorial Day meal.  We arrived at about 11am, comfortably within the 10am-3pm dim sum timeframe. The half-full parking lot seemed to correlate with the half-full restaurant; it was spacious enough that we were promptly seated in the middle of the dining room. Before we had much of a chance to get situated, or even receive a menu, employees were already bringing by food on trays or carts.  As is typical of the cuisine, pretty much everything is served in small plates. Per the web site, the menu is grouped into tiers of items costing $2.29, $3.19, $3.99, $4.99, or $6.99. I did the math on our cost (about $40 at the end) and believe this to be accurate, and a cursory comparison with menu photos of their local competitors suggests that Chang's is by far the cheapest.  Most of the items were quite enjoyable. Pan Fried Turnip Cake, Shrimp Har Gow, and a couple of items which I couldn't match to the menu were all solid. Fried Wonton w/ Shrimp & Pork and Fried Shrimp Ball tasted especially good, whether it was the crunchy exteriors or the mayo-based accompanying sauce. Steamed Sweet Rice w/ Shrimp was something I'd never seen before, a mix of rice with shrimp paste, and it was fun. Deep Fried Taro Cake w/ Chicken & Pork tasted oddly sweet/fragrant but was still fine.  Not everything was beyond reproach. I don't get the hype over the Steamed Bar-B-Q Pork Bun. The dough and meat are similar to any other similar buns which I've had, but you'd think that Scrooge himself portioned out the meager fillings. The Steamed Pork & Shrimp \"Sil Myl\" (usually spelled Shu Mai) felt as if it were full of dried pork somehow. The Baked Egg Custard came out very hot but was rather bland in all aspects.  Some of the other concerns which I had are some of the pushy employees somehow waiting until you say no about 3-4 times to back off with some dishes, and the lack of labeling on the tableside condiments potentially leading you to dispense something decidedly not a soy sauce from a Kikkoman bottle. Also, I was dismayed to hear that the walnut prawns did not appear to be available except at regular a la carte price despite being listed on the dim sum menu (in the highest priced category).  All that aside, Chang's Hong Kong Cuisine provides cheap (currently) and enjoyable dim sum, so they're about as good as any other of the off-Strip options as far as I've experienced. Give them a try if you've got the craving.",

Bottom line: It's one of the worse dim sum I've ever had.  For example the hau gau, the skin was so thick, I could barely bite into the shrimp filling.  For the shrimp roll, it's the opposite, the roll was way too thin and broke up like a cheap suit when trying to pick it up with my chopsticks.  The shrimp was a puny size, slightly bigger than bay shrimp.  One positive was the prices were very reasonable, the shrimp roll was less than $3, I guess the saying goes that you get what you pay for.",

We had:  Steamed BBQ Pork Bun Fried Sesame Ball Deep Fried Dumpling w/ Chicken, Pork Steamed Pork, Shrimp Sil Myl Pan Fried Turnip Cake Shrimp, Pork, Veg in Bean Curd Sheets Rice Noodle Roll w/ Shrimp Beef Book Tripe  This was one of the best places we've been for dim sum.  The steamed BBQ buns were very good. m  The deep fried dumpling was a new dish for the group and I'd order it again! he turnip cake is something that doesn't appeal to some of our group, but I enjoyed it.  For dessert, the server brought us very hot sesame balls with red bean paste inside.  They were outstanding!  Service was very good.  We have the advantage of having a native Chinese speaker in our group and she did the ordering and interacting with the staff for us.  It was a noisy, friendly place filled with people enjoying good dim sum and it was a chance for us to be raucous, too!  This will be our number #1 choice for another time.",

(Sorry sport fans, my ol' body can't take too much spicey food...)  Try to visit at lunch to sample their dim sum dishes.  Carts roll around with hot & cold dishes of manapua (pork filled buns), pork hash (steamed pork in rice flour wrappers), chicken feet (yup, a little fatty but not bad), rice pudding, and many more dishes.  Prices are per dish and if this is your first time, finish your dish before getting more.  Otherwise you'll end up with lots of leftovers.  The service is a littl below average and during my visit, there didn't seem to be enough servers ca the number of customers.  Language is a problem also since most of the staff speaks Cantonese as a first language.  But they try to be helpful.",

Dim Sum places on main Chinatown can be crowded and super busy especially during holiday seasons. They have variety of dim sums available and many carts were rotating throughout the restaurant so you didn't have to wait or flag anyone down. Service was also excellent. As soon as we set, the gentleman took our drink orders and offered complimentary hot tea. As for dim sum, it was your standard dim sum but still yummy. The ladies with carts took the time to explain the items they had. I really like the fact that it was away from the main Chinatown and we could take our time and enjoy midmorning breakfast.",

My colleagues and I ventured to Chang's today for a quick dim sum lunch. We had hot tea and water to drink. Then the carts came around like vultures lookin for fresh meat! Service quick and constant, though in previous times the favorites can take some time. Tip: order a couple of what you like or you might have to wait for more to be cooked if it's busy.  We made our choices and ordered seconds of a few we enjoyed. Below is a summary of the orders made. Hope this helps and keeps you informed of what to choose:  2/5 the calamari was very dry and more breading than meat.  3/5 chow mein, pork bun, har gow (shrimp dumpling) and siu mai (pork dumplings).  4/5 the coconut bun, red bean sesame ball, sticky rice (dessert) and the deep fried shrimp ball! I always get a coconut bun to go and enjoy later.",

From pork to shrimp to meatball they have options that'll fit everybody's unique taste including stuff that looked to be a vegetarian.   They do have tons of side dishes Rice's and noodles and even some donuts and other stuff as well as desserts such as egg tarts which were really good. Steamed pork buns look good we didn't up getting on so I would like to go back to try those but the regular pork dumplings were absolutely perfect.   the women who go around with the carts are very nice and they do have a couple manager to walk around that do speak a little better English if they're unable to explain to you which does happen so they will gladly get them to help you with your needs. one of the best things about this place was the price I couldn't believe how cheap it was when we got our check it was only around 30 something dollars which was a heck of a lot less compared to what I thought since we had quite a bit of food!",

Our party shared West Lake Style Beef Soup, Rice in Clay Pot with Chicken and Sausage, Chinese Broccoli, Salt and Pepper Pork Chop, Steamed Chicken, and Steamed Goby with Soy Sauce, Ginger, and Scallion. Everything except the Steamed Chicken was quite flavorful.   The dishes that stood out were the West Lake Style Beef Soup, Rice in Claypot with Chicken and Sausage, and Steamed Goby with Soy Sauce, Ginger, and Scallion. I liked how there was crispy rice on the bottom of the claypot and how fresh the fish was. It was probably the best steamed fish I've ever had from a Chinese restaurant.  We ended our meal with Coconut Jelly topped with Purple Rice, which was light and refreshing.",

I can describe the other dishes that are tasty but I'm trying something different each time I go. The carts come around throughout dining room and it's always nice to see your food or ask for whatever you're looking for. They will also heat up a dish if it's too cold.  Try Chang's for Dim Sum and if you go on a weekend prepare to possibly wait for a table. This experience is all about the food since the service is really only delivering food, clearing plates and filling water or tea. The service I always get is consistent and never had  any issues.",

    "text": "My eldest kid and I were having a mommy and me day when she wanted to get some lunch.  Of course shrimp dumplings aka Har Gow is her absolute favorite and that's what she wanted.  No budging there.  During Chinese New Year weekend no less.   Our go to dim sum spot is KJ Dim Sum in Rio.  We went there and it was packed and just nuts.  The wait was 1 hour for a table for 2.  No way.  I hit up my foodie friends and asked for fave dim sum spots.  Yum Cha seemed to be the popular dim sum spot in town, which I had bookmarked and wanted to try.  But I called and nobody answered the phone twice so I didn't feel like chancing it with a trip over there.  Chang's was another recommendation and I had never heard of this place so I immediately bookmarked it and called them, only a 15 minute wait for 2 guests.  So we headed that way.  When we arrived, the place was pretty packed, not KJ Dim Sum packed but still very busy.  We put our name on the wait list and they said 15 minutes.  She handed me a small piece of paper with \"E4\" on it. No problem.  20 minutes later, I check back in and the hostess told me it would be 15 minutes.  My response, \"You told me that 20 minutes ago.\"  And then she said, \"I'm sorry, I don't know how much longer.\"  The wait list system was chaotic, unorganized and just a big mess.  I put my name on the list at 11:45am.  When they FINALLY sat us, it was 12:20pm, 35 minutes instead of the estimated 15 minutes.  This gets better.  When they finally sat us down.  They put us at a table that was still dirty.  No joke.  But I was trying to be patient and keep a happy face for my kid who really wanted the Har Gow for lunch.  We were sitting at the table for 10 minutes and nobody stopped by the table to say hello or bus the table.  I had to flag down one of the ladies from the hostess stand, possibly the manager or owner and ask her to have someone come clean the table.  She was very apologetic and about 5 minutes later, she got the busboy to come over.  She again was very apologetic and I totally understand that it was nuts in there.  But at this point, I was already turned off with the underestimated wait time, being sat at a dirty table and nobody coming over to clean up the table until 15 minutes later?  We finally get a server.  Not a very good one.  He was obviously stressed out and inattentive.  I ordered Jasmine tea.  He brings over a tea pot and two tea cups.  Waited 5-10 minutes until a dim sum cart actually comes by.  We're starving and just want Har Gow and pork dumplings.  That cart finally arrives and we immediately get those items.  My kid is still hungry and I dread ordering anything else.  I waved down our server and just ordered another order of Har Gow instead of waiting forever for a dim sum cart to roll on by.  Also asked for the check so we could get out of there.  The restaurant space is confusing and not very efficient for dim sum carts!!!!  Too many nooks and crannies and not enough space for them to roll the carts around.  It was painful to watch.  Listen, granted it was Chinese New Year weekend and I realize it was a crazy day to come out for dim sum.  I get that.  But even so, I was not impressed from the start. The place is outdated and dirty. The service was terrible. The food was not worth the wait. Considering how long we ended up waiting here, we were better off waiting that hour at KJ Dim Sum.   I feel as if they purposely quote you 15 min when it should have been 30-45 minutes because they don't want to lose your business. No thank you. The one thing I did like about Chang's, they offer free hot tea. But still won't get me back here.",

Then she argued that there were more then three carts and they should have five at least... ?  Gold Coast and the Rios has lots of options and the service is good too.. as a Chinese I suggest you go to other place.",

    "text": "Woah, hold up... $2.99 for all dim sum? I definitely stopped and did a double take on the banner advertisement hung right above their entrance. Rubbed my eyes and stared again and the $2.99 was still there. Talk about a great deal!   Although I haven't been to this place in a while, I was once a loyal customer. Our fridge still holds a family photo taken here close to ten years ago. No matter how much time goes by Chang's is always the same- same atmosphere, same friendly folks. One thing different this time was the quality of food, which I'm sorry to say has gone way down. Even the $2.99 price tag doesn't justify such flavorless dim sum ):  Out of 10 items ordered, the only thing good were the custard pineapple buns, and strangely, they were actually some of the best I've ever had. Fresh out the oven, crisp shell, LEGIT custard filling that's made from salted egg yolk. The hot runny custard is the best part, and there's so much that it runs down your hand with each bite! I can't recommend anyone coming here due to the lackluster food, but if you're desperate for dim sum and low on cash, I recommend you try those pineapple buns above anything else  Also want to note a weird thing about this place is that you walk up to a cashier window to pay for your meal. I've never seen a cashier window at a big dine in restaurant before and I felt like I buying movie tickets or something lol. But the guy working there was super fast and efficient though so props to that! I'd much rather walk up and pay than wait forever for someone to pick up my card. Aside from the price, the friendly and welcoming service here is honestly the only other thing stopping me from giving a lower rating. Maybe I'll give this place another try but not anytime soon",

As with most \"authentic\" dim sum places, there are more asians than other types of patrons.

Literally putting it on the table as you are saying NO!  I have heard that the ladies are now on commission so, if True, that could be the reason.  Also, Chang's has raised their prices significantly.  To me, Orchid Gardens is a much better bet and they have a bigger selection of dim sum rotating throughout the restaurant most times.",

We were a little put off when they asked us if we would share a table with another party, but after we refused to share they found us a table pretty quickly.  The food was fresh and delicious, lots of choices and everything was a hit.  The pork buns were still warm, the turnip cake was delicious, and we were so excited that they had porridge and the Chinese donuts!  Service was not great, but that's no surprise- the food more than made up for it.  I didn't have an egg tart at the end of the meal because I was stuffed, but those at our table who did said they were incredibly fresh and tasty.  I'll definitely be back next time I'm craving dim sum in Vegas!",

(think of it as brain food!) the shrimp har gow was pretty good. i also sampled some noodles that reminded me of thai pad see ew and i loved them. some of my party thought them to be too spicy but i could have ate it all day. everything was pretty cheap. i didn't like how they force the tea on you though and even if you don't drink it they still charge you for it. very weird. i also wish most of the items didn't have shrimp in them. i don't mind eating it, but it is not my favorite thing in the world. (yet i did like the little bites of it.) we arrived when they first opened so we got a table, but it did get pretty busy fast. make sure to come with an empty stomach to fill up.",

The service was great the ladies were real nice and our drink glasses were never empty always refilled. They'd seat us at tables with lots of room so we aren't cramped. I love dim sum places where you can order a particular dim sum not available on the cart. We really enjoyed the fried shrimp balls (looks like a hush puppy) it was crunchy, sweet and moist in the center, the bbq pork noodle is our standard go to dim sum which didn't disappoint, pork dumplings, bbq pork siopao, bbq baked bun (dinner roll stuffed w/ bbq pork), and shrimp dumplings were some of our favorites. They also offered mini entree dishes that they walked around offering like salt and pepper shrimp and salt and pepper calamari. The prices were reasonable dim sum from $1.85-$2.50 and entrees around $7.00.   The 2nd time we came here we came real late almost 2:45 and they didn't give us a hard time because their dim sum ends at 3pm and they took our orders on any dim sum we wanted that they didn't have available on the carts. And even though most of them were at lunch eating at the corner we were still served and attended to very nicely.   We will be back here when we're in the Vegas area.",

They do have the traditional chinese drab and they also cater to Americans and their ever so sweet orang chicken. The dim sum, next to Cathay house I think are similar. I miss having dim sum partners. Sigh....Oh well. Overall I had them kill a fish. Bass, fry it up and have a hot and spicy/black bean sauce on the side with sauteed peppers and onions....Mmmm Rice....Yea definitely a step up. However if you don't know where it is, it's not easy to find. Their marketing team kinda sucks. So here's to help you out Chang's and many more meals to come :)",

Pros: very flavorful and tender bbq pork, ho fun was cooked al dente, yo tao (sp?) was greasy/fluffy/crunchy all at the same time but a little cold  Cons: not a great selection, steamed foods were lacking, tea costs extra, price is on the expensive side, extremely crowded on weekends, slow service",

The boyfriend and I checked it out and we will be returning to fulfill dim sum cravings in the future. We went on a Thursday afternoon around 2pm (they serve dim sum up until 5pm). My only complaint is one of the dishes we got off the traveling carts was cold :( But other than that the food was great and reasonably priced.",

Never had this problem at Orchids Garden.",

The shrimp dumplings were fantastic, but my favorite was the Gai-LAN (Chinese broccoli). It was PERFECTLY cooked tender crisp.  It was a large amount as well and I couldn't stop eating it, which was great because it was the healthiest thing we ordered by far.  The only thing is I tried to take a co-worker friend after school at 3:30 and dim sum was over.  The website says dim sum goes until 5:00.  We ordered entrees that were still very good, but I was a little disappointed dim sum was over.  Other than that, the place is fantastic.",

The prices looked pretty reasonable with dishes mostly from 2-4 dollars.   We tried the siu mei,  sticky rice wrapped in lotus leaf, steamed buns with bbq pork, pork porridge, and rice noodle roll with shrimp.  Everything was pretty good but the sticky rice stood out because it had some meat (sausage)  in it and was modestly seasoned and not greasy.  We also tried the baked sweet bun that everyone seemed to be taking home.  It was warm and flaky with a sweet yummy egg-containing filling inside.  The only real drawback about this place is the food is rather soporific, probably because they use their share of msg.",

The pricing is also a lot more expensive than other dimsum places I've been to, and I've been to some very good dimsum places in Pasadena and Little Saigon. Overall I'd recommend Harbor Palace.",

I have been here on lots of occasions over the years. Sometimes the place is hit or miss as far as service goes, but that's to be expected. I do enjoy their dim sum quite a bit. I would be inclined to believe it's actually the best dim sum in town. If you come at the right time, you don't have to wait too long for a table and they come around really quickly with their carts full of delectable goodies. My favorite dim sum items are the salt and pepper prawns, wide noodles in XO sauce, whatever the vegetable of the day is there and their desserts. Pretty much everything else is good too. Their dinner entrees are pretty good as well.   They do have great food and hit or miss service, but all in all this place is a great place to check out for some delicious Chinese cuisine. Great place for large parties as well. The more people, the more you get to share and try. Yum.",

I enjoyed turnip cake, black bean spare ribs, shrimp dumplings, beef balls, shrimp rolled in rice noodle, the options were great!  Servers were very friendly and eager to please.

    "text": "I could've sworn I wrote about this place already...It's one of my fav Chinese spots in town.  I was very wary coming here because it was deserted. I actually thought they were closed the first time. The crazy part is that the dining room is pretty big but don't be surprised if you are the only one there. Normally this is a very bad sign that the restaurant is awful but I took my chances and I'm glad I did.  They have some off the wall plates and I was in a daring mood so I decided to try the Bird's Nest. Sounds crazy but it's just seafood and veggies in a chow-mein-ish bowl. The chow-mein/noodle is made into a dried cracker bowl and the seafood just sits inside it. Just in case this was a bust we ordered a \"safe\" dish in orange chicken.  The food was amazing. The Bird's Nest was very enjoyable and fun to eat! The bowl soaks in the seafood juicies and the crunchy bite into the chow-mein is so satisfying. The orange chicken tastes really good but not over the top with flavors. They give you a ton of rice + hot tea so I really enjoyed the service.  I don't know how they stay in business when they are empty all the time. I've been there three times now and the most I've seen is 1 table besides us. I've been thinking...Perhaps this is a secret hideout for the local Chinese gang and there is a basement beneath the kitchen where the mob players poker, sip on tsing tao and plot their next big heist. The whole restaurant is just a front for their scheme. Hmm, maybe but I could care less. HA! I will be returning in the near future.",

    "text": "Chang's of Las Vegas is an institution.  When the Chinatown region of Las Vegas was just developing, I remember having a meal at Chang's and being impressed by the quality.    Fast forward at least ten years later and I'm glad to see Chang's is still around (now with two branches) and that their quality is still up to par.   The majority of diners go to Chang's for traditional Hong Kong style dim sum.  However, for our meal, we came for dinner and ordered a traditional Chinese banquet.    Having eaten in Hong Kong, Vancouver, San Francisco, and Los Angeles, I admit I wasn't expecting much.  But after dinner, I came away quite happy and thought the meal was a fantastic deal as well.  Service was surprisingly good and it's a surprise this place was relatively quiet of patrons.  It may be off the strip, but I can guarantee the Chinese food is better than most offerings on the Strip and of much higher and authentic quality.  Two thumbs up.  A sampling of our menu:  Appetizer plate - a beautiful presentation of Chinese BBQ items like duck and goose, alongside sliced meat selections, jellyfish, shrimp and seaweed.  Everything was flavorful and really started the menu off right.  Crab claws - Deep fried crab claws fresh out of the fryer were hot and delicious and was served alongside what looked like deep fried seaweed.  The waiter later informed us it was the top part of the gai lan Chinese vegetable deep fried and seasoned with salt.  Unique and delicious.  No one wanted the waiter to take it away.  Shark Fin Soup - classic presentation with good flavor and plentiful pieces of Virginia ham and chicken to complement the fin.  Peking Duck - a whole prepared duck was brought out, skinned, and served to each patron in a bun.  They then sliced the excellent duck meat and served that as a platter as well.  Braised Abalone with Chinese Vegetables - the abalone was not the least bit overdone and the vegetables were top notch  Steamed fish - I believe a whole rock cod was prepared steamed with ginger and soy sauce.  Live and fresh.  Wok fried lobster - a large lobster cut into pieces and sauteed with ginger and scallions.  E-fu noodles - a wonderful side dish alongside the fried rice.  Fried rice - standard fried rice  Overall, we were extremely pleased with Chang's.  Service was polite and fast, entrees were delicious and plentiful, and prices were very competitive.  We all left with more leftovers than we knew what to do with and everyone had plenty of their favorite dishes.  Next time you're in Vegas craving authentic Chinese food, you deserve to give this place (or it's sister branch) a try.    Chang's accepts credit cards, including American Express.",

They seem to have more local customers than tourists here, and I usually only came here when I meet up with friends that live locally.  Parking can be very limited during the weekend lunch hour.   Wait time seems to inevitable during those time as well.   Price wise is slightly lower than the ones closer to the Strip, but so does their quality.  Some of the dim sum felt like a hit or miss, but still better than ones I had back at my home state and some place in town.  The dishes here were not as good as I had in other Chinese places as well.    Aside from listening in on other Chinese gossiping dramas for entertainment, the cheap Dim Sum is all they have to offer here.  We received the usual poker face style Chinese services, and added entertainment from staffs gossiping about their management.",

The 'cart pushers' aren't very friendly or talkative but when you point to an item they give it to you so I'm not complaining. The prices are very reasonable for a family of four.  The place could use some more parking spaces because every time I've been there the lot has been full and I had to wait for somebody to leave.",

The service was good and the restaurant was pretty full. The bill was generous, spent around $55ish for the 4 of us.. but we ordered a variety.

I don't know if I was one of the first to be there as it opened but the service was uneven.  They had two carts loaded but it took them a while to come by.  I tried all the usual, shrimp & pork Shu-mai, potstickers, funn-roll (rice crepe-interesting smoky flavor), and finished with sesame balls.  All the food tasted very good.  My neighbor was having what looked like a bowl of tripe and chicken feet.  All in all a very authentic place with very good dim sum but with uneven service.",

This was my first dim sum experience in Vegas.  @ Shrimp Dumplings - Good shrimp and texture on the skin.   @ Pork Dumplings - This looked good, but it did have a taste like it was spoiled.  @ Fried Shrimps - Its similar to the stuff you get in the frozen food isle and you deep fry quickly.  @ Fried Shrimp in Wonton Skin - This is a much better appetiizer than the fried shrimp. Its more crispier and you can actually taste the shrimp flavor in this.  @ Shrimp in Rice Noodles - The shrimp was good, but the rice noodles and soy sauce just seem out of place. The rice noodle was a little mushy and it seems like they used the wrong kind of soy sauce, not the diluted soy sauce.  @ Congee - This was just bad. Lack of flavor and just disappointing for me.   @ Egg Filled Buns - Another disappointing item. The fillings could have more flavor, but its just a bun with an egg filling. Just blah.   @ Sweet Tofu Desert - Good smooth taste. Nothing spectacular however.  This is one of the more inexpensive dim sums in town and probably one of the better ones. But that isn't saying much. I would say this place falls short of Ping Pang Pong slightly, but not by much. Those raised with CA dimsum will be disappointed. Everyone else should enjoy the dishes.",

I wasn't going to try this but I figured why not? I guess its an aquired taste because I put a TOE in my mouth and tried to suck off the skin....and its kind of just oozed onto my tongue.  I gracefully put the foot onto my plate and there it stayed the rest of the meal.   I just couldn't handle the texture.  The seasoning and light chile sauce was great but the gelatenous skin wasn't doing it for me....AT ALL!!  I know we ate more but I can't remember anything else ..(i was still drunk from the night before!)

We will return since the location is closer than our other dim sum favorite locations.  Definitely worth trying.",

    "text": "Average foods and service. I enjoyed it. But their attitude sucked. Let me explain...  I've been there once and anxious to return for a second visit. Dim sum was meant to be eaten with friends. So I surrounded myself with friends each time.  We all agree the foods were good, ranging from American fried foods to steamed southern Chinese dumplings. There was nothing bad and nothing outstanding. The service was on par with most big dim sum places. So are the ambiance and restroom.  After we're done, we split the cost and paid the tips. The restaurant only accepted credit card for minimal $20. So we all paid cash to one that used CC. The waitress chased after the group asking for tips. Not just once, but twice.  There are 2 problems here. First, tipping is a gratitude. I decide how much to tip and not influenced by anyone else. If the wait staffs have lousy attitude, I don't tip and most likely I will not return regardless of the foods.  Second, if we left the tips on the table and they couldn't find it, who's at fault?  It's audacious to ask for tips once, being purely shameless. Twice? It's plain outrageous.  So diners, heed my warning... they were very proud of their wait service and they will let you know about it if you don't tip. Unfortunately the service was average and they expect instant reward.",

It was lunch time and there were a lot of people in the restaurant, but only 3 trolleys roaming around over and over again. One trolley was jook with Chinese donut, the other two were dim sum items. Well, the dim sum wasn't all that great. It was mediocre at best. We had 4 baskets and the total came to slightly over $11 before tip. The tripe was flavorless, the stuffed bean curd sheets were okay. Har gow were below average, leaving the cha siu bao being the only thing passable. One of the servers came over and asked if we wanted to order some food. I asked hubby and he asked for the check. The woman then asked me in Cantonese if the food wasn't to my liking. I thought \"ya think\"? but then didn't really verbalize it. Why be nasty? But we'll never come back again on future trips.",

Luckily they were able to seat our large group and we started to order away - we go the usual staples of dim sum - haw gao (shrimp dumplings), sew mai (pork dumplings), chicken feet, pork buns, and more. We must have ordered a lot since we were all stuffed by the time we finished eating, but to our surprise when we got the bill, it was only $10 a person (including tip). Definitely will have to come back again for dim sum and also try out the chinese food for dinner.",

The dim sum selection and taste is by far the best I've ever tasted in US. It was a pity that it was just 2 of us and we could only stomach that much food. I would have loved to try more.  My top top favorites: - The egg tarts (they taste just like those you'd find in HK). We had 3 plates of that and I wish I could pack to bring home but they wouldn't taste as nice then.   - The soya beancurd is so smooth and the ginger taste is very subtle that blends in with the beancurd. I've tasted the soya beancurd in another restaurant and it was just too gingery. We ordered additional 2 portions to go and had them chilled when we reached home. They tasted just as great chilled & warm.  - Chives dumplings were also good.  I would definitely visit this restaurant when I head to LV again. Service was also decent. Carts of dim sum were being pushed around the whole restaurant.",

The bbq pork buns were smaller than what i'm used to and the bbq was a bit lighter than what i've had but it was still good! Also, my fave item, the yellow custard buns (in the bread that's much like the bbq pork buns) were so fresh and yummy! Shu mai was tasty, and these pot sticker looking things were just amazing!   Anyway, I will be coming back here the next time I come to Vegas- and according to the yelp reviews, is the best dim sum in vegas! :)",

The selection is pretty good, and everything was the right temperature, the hot things were hot, and the cold were cold (which is really important to me).

The Hong Kong-style noodles with seafood was pretty good though.  Based on my experience here, I'll come back but only during peak dim sum hours (11 am til 2 pm).

Kidding, the dim-sum here actually isn't that bad. While I wouldn't call this place amazing by any means, it's probably comparable to a lot of the average places you'll find in Los Angeles. My friends and I ordered all the standard dishes (,,,, etc.) and they all came out pretty solid. No complaints from me on that front!   I also ordered some takeout to bring back for my fiance, who wasn't able to make it but nonetheless still wanted dim-sum. Here's the only part of this entire meal that bothered me. I flagged down a waiter so that I could get a separate take-out order, and he was probably the most inexperienced and unhelpful server I could have found at this restaurant. He couldn't speak any Mandarin or Cantonese, so I had some difficulty describing what I wanted since I usually don't think of dim-sum dishes in English. Then, when I figured out what the English names of the dishes I wanted were called, he told me that he was going to have to get someone else because I had \"too many orders for him to remember.\" Gee, I didn't realize four items would be that hard to remember, especially when they were all staple dim-sum foods.   I ended up going to the cashier counter to make my order. This time, placing my order was super easy because the lady understood Chinese, but it somehow took them 20 minutes to gather the four things I wanted. I highly doubt that they were waiting on anything to be cooked, because I saw multiple carts come by with exactly what I had ordered. Ugh. Annoying.  Overall still a fun excursion, but there's a lot that could've been done better, especially regarding their service. I usually cut Asian restaurants some slack about service because it tends not to be that great, but there are some things that are just too ridiculous to overlook.",

Finally, the moment of truth arrived after we were seated and got our dim sum orders from the carts strolling by. We had the basics e.g. shrimp dumplings, beef meatballs, shrimp balls; dried tofu skin rolls, steamed rice rolls with shrimp fillings and  Chinese broccoli. The food was average, but the skin of the har-gow (shrimp dumplings) and cheong-fun (rice roll with shrimp) was of poor consistence, they fell apart as being picked up. This place is a ok if you crave for dim sum, but not anything special to write home about.",

The trick is not to come too late if you're having Dim Sum...As long as it's early enough, there are plenty of carts making their way around...  As for the quality of the food...it's usually pretty good. Since my GF doesn't eat beef, we steer clear of those dishes and eat a lot of pork, chicken, and seafood.   Service is generally typical of Chinese restaurants where I eat dim sum....Not attentive, but not lacking. If you need something, flag anyone down and they get right on it usually.  All in all, i try to make it out here on a regular basis, so they gotta be doing something right!",

On our latest trip back to Vegas, hubby suggested hitting it up for old time's sake so I agreed. Good news is there was no wait at peak lunch hours.  Bad news is there is no wait at peak lunch hours.  I remember when it used to take an hour to get a table here.  But I guess back then, there weren't as many Asian eating establishments to compete with.  We ate solely their dim sum dishes and quite honestly, they're pretty tasty.  Hubby and I both love their version of \"Phoenix claws\" (a pretty euphemism for chicken feet).  Unlike most other soggy, overcooked mushy versions, this one had bite as well as flavor.    It's also been a long time since I've paid any attention to the basics such as shau mai and har gow...but their har gow (shrimp dumplings) was a mini game-changer for me.  The skin was chewy and the filling was very delicious.  Did not fall apart when you picked it up.  Other faves:  stewed tripe, comes on the same cart as the thousand year old egg porridge. Sticky rice dumping (salty water dumpling if you're translating from Chinese)  Service was efficient and brisk, sometimes even friendly.  We were in and out in less than an hour, eating at a leisurely pace.  The place is definitely showing its age but overall, still delicious.",

If you're extremely hungry, be mindful of any drool dripping out of your mouth while you stare at the carts slowly make their way towards you.  When the time finally comes when the cart that you've been staring at is parked at your table, load up on your favorite items since you don't know how long it'll take to come back around.  Another thing to highlight is that the waiters kept my water and tea jar topped off so that was a big plus.  This is located not too far from the strip so whenever you find yourself in Vegas and craving some solid dim sum, this is a great go-to spot.",

One of those close friends thought it would be awesome to get some dim sum for lunch. I've only been to one place in the valley so I was excited to try another place out.  The place is not in Chinatown but close enough. As you approach the building you'll notice a nice Chinese bridge to walk through in order to get through the front door which I thought was a nice touch. When you enter the joint, you'll notice a lot of space! Big round tables everywhere, big windows, lots of Chinese art and symbols. This place looks authentic. The staff was friendly and although there was a language barrier in some cases, they were very patient with us.   The food was alright. Not the best that I've tried in Las Vegas. My favorite was a pork and shrimp hash type dumpling. It reminded me of back home. Some dishes that weren't such a success was the fried rice. It was molded in a bowl and super oily. Lots of the things served, seemed to be sitting a while and not as fresh as I've tasted in the past. I appreciated the dim sum selection as there were a lot, however, most of what was offered wasn't as fresh as I hoped.   I'm thinking this was just a fluke. I really hope to give them another chance soon. I don't necessarily think they were the worst and their staff was super nice. I'll be back and hopefully my review will be updated with a higher rating.",

So I called to place an order and they said they don't deliver. Not being familiar with the area and the restaurant was recommended by the hotel, we still placed an order. We wanted vegetable spring rolls and they said they were \"out\" of them. Then we wanted cucumber Szechuan style and he had no idea what I was talking about but eventually said they didn't have any of those either.  We drove to pick up our order and the building looked a little run down. There were about 2 cars in the parking lot and we thought it was out of business. We went in and nobody greeted us so we went into the dining room. There was only one table eating. It took about 5 minutes of us waiting around to pay and then they finally gave us our food. When we got home, there was sauce that spilled in the bottom of one of the bags.  We carefully took the takeout boxes out of the bags and they were extremely greasy. The food was okay but again, very greasy.  The sweet and sour sauce was very spicy and the kids didn't not enjoy it. Sorry, I would not recommend this restaurant at this time.",

    "text": "Chang's was easily our favorite place to go for dim sum on Saturdays/Sundays when we used to live in Las Vegas. In fact, whenever I asked my wife where she wanted to eat on the weekends for lunch, she would immediately yell out \"Chang's!\".  It took us a while to find Chang's, and we ended up googling best dim sum place in Las Vegas, and Chang's was the first search result to display. We saw that it was less than 10 minutes away from our house, so we decided to check it out and give it a try. We were definitely not disappointed!  Normally, my biggest gripe about dim sum places is that the venues are normally huge dining hall areas, and the servers cart around the food forever and the food gets cold, and by the time we get it, it is no longer fresh. At Chang's the restaurant is small enough venue, so the food is ALWAYS fresh, especially if you get a table next to where the carts come out from the kitchen.   I have a few recommendations for the best dim sum dishes. Definitely get the fried pork dumplings (ham shay go). This is my favorite dish there! It's less than $4 per order, which comes with 3 fried pork dumplings. I also really like the Chinese pan friend leek buns (gow choi). This is a less-widely known dish, but is equally amazing. Also less than $4 per order! Other recommendations include: salt and pepper shrimp or calamari, chinese broccoli, pork and shrimp siomai, and har gao (shrimp dumpling). If you stick with these items, you'll be set. I've gone for dinner before, and it isn't the best of Chinese restaurants, so make sure you just go for lunch dim sum, and don't bother with their regular menu items (this is the only reason I rate this place a 4-star versus a 5-star).  We love all of the dim sum items there, and we have dreams about them. No joke. It is one of the places that we always go back to visit when we travel to Las Vegas. Not too far away the strip if you are a tourist. Go where the locals go and don't get dim sum in the casinos. Trust me on this one.",

On the Monday, wait time as expected was zero minute, and we were seated right away! and Yes, we were smart! teeheeee :P  Foods were delicious, in great variety; prices were very reasonable; service was prompt and friendly, yet a little pushy.  This one dim sum lady just kept on stopping by our table to ask whether we might want this and that even though we had said to her, \"no, thank you,\" a couple of times already.  She just wouldn't stop until we actually took something from her cart.  Anyways, that was fine, and the dim sum carts experience was fun.",

The wait time at 11:30 was about 30 minutes long (not too bad) but the food was just okay. I felt like the rice wrapped in shrimp tastes a little bit artificial and the Shu Mai didn't have as much flavor as I though it would.   There was about 5 ladies pushing the cart and I thought it was funny when people were running up to them and taking things off their cart instead of letting them walk by. The Chinese donut was extremely fried and almost as yellow as turmeric but my boyfriend said it was delicious.   I think the service could have been better too as the ladies pushing the cart skipped our table and other tables next to us a few times. All in all, I think I will give it another shot before I make my final decision. The place was clean and the floors were clean- at least they have that down!",

    "text": "Been here several times for dim sum because it's the closest dim sum place to the westside without having to go into a casino. Because of this, there is typically a wait, unless you get here right when it opens, and it can be a problem finding a parking spot. To combat this, you can always order your food to go, or call ahead to do so, and avoid the wait. Prices are average for dim sum, with a mix of 12 small and medium dishes coming in around $40 with tax.  As for the food, it is satisfying if you have a craving, but only just so. There is nothing here that I have loved, nor anything they make that I specifically crave. Most of the dishes are average, or even tasty. The problem is that they are extremely skimpy on the good stuff. For example, some of my dim sum favorites are char siu bao (bbq pork bun) and lo mai gai (stuffed sticky rice). Both of these are tasty here, but they come with very little filling. The bbq pork bun is too much bun and not nearly enough meat filling, I'd say less than half that of a good place in California. And the sticky rice is all rice, you honestly cannot say that there is a layer of filling, only small patches. The taste is there in the parts that you get, but there simply isn't enough of it.   If you are in the area and don't want to drive to a casino or to the Chinese area of Las Vegas, then this place is alright. I definitely don't recommend you go out of your way to come here though. If they weren't so skimpy, and added more filling to their items, then I would make this a regular spot.",

The only reason I've giving this place 1 star is cause of the shitty customer service. Their website clearly states they do Dim Sum till 10:30pm. We came in and sat down looked over the menu for about 15 minutes while we drank our tea. We tell our server were going to do Dim Sum and he says no dim sum today because the cook left early. WTF!? That is the only reason why we came here and thier website says they serve it till 10:30pm!  What's worse is they didn't tell us when we came in we sat there wasting our time. It crappie when this is what your known for and you don't have it. When I told the server about it and what their website says he looked at me like I was from Pluto.

We eat dim sum in the OC quite a bit, but agreed that this place was better than any dim sum we had there. Some great highlights were the pan fried turnip cakes, (get the chili oil & soy sauce for dipping), baked pork buns, and rolled rice noodles with shrimp. My dad particularly liked the liu sha bao so much that we ordered extra togo! Everything we ordered we were happy with and my parents are very selective eaters.   The service wasn't extremely attentive, but for the quality of the food it didn't really matter. The best asian places are the ones with this kind of look and feel anyway, so it's an experience that you have to be willing to adapt to if you want authentic cuisine!",

What's more lovely than a ball of sausage rolled up in a light pastry and steamed with all of its glorious juices?   Chang's was not the exception and it has all the best Dim Sum and the fish tank to boot. We had Shrimp and Pork Pan Fried Dumpling with Scallions, Steamed BBQ Pork Bun (the hubs fav, he said these had large chunks of pork which he likes), Oyster Sauce with Broccoli, Walnut Prawns, Pork and Shrimp Sui Mai and Bean Curd Wrap (my fav and it was fabulous).   This place could easily be 5 star if they made sure their Dim Sum didn't do 9 laps around the dining room before it arrived at your table. Unfortunately, the Walnut Shrimp was cold and other dishes would have been cold if we had not watched the little Nascars racing around the room. If you are up to playing the game however, you can easilly tell which dishes are coming out fresh and then snag them.   I've been to Dim Sum elsewhere where this cold food issue wasn't an issue. We felt like they kept offering us more when we had clearly refused approximately 8 times. Oh, well...it was still good. And I would totally come back.",

We were expecting a wait since it was a Sunday at lunch, but there wasn't a wait.  The restaurant was about 75% full when we arrived for lunch.  We were immediately seated and the women pushing the carts started coming by our table.  We got some of our favorites - BBQ pork bun, siu mai, shrimp rice noodle, and sesame balls.  All were fairly good, but the one dish they didn't have was my favorite - shrimp dumplings (har gow).  I really wanted to try har gow at Chang's, but every time I asked a woman, she said she didn't have it.    Chang's goes on the tiered pricing model, so some dishes are more expensive than others.  Most places in Los Angeles are like this too, which is why I love Ocean Star because they have a flat pricing schedule.  The food was good at Chang's and about the same as other dim sum places I've tried in the Vegas Chinatown area.  The best thing about Chang's was we didn't have to wait for a table!  We got four dishes and the bill came out to around $16.00.  Please see my pictures.  Xie Xie!",

    "text": "Dim Sum isn't something I often do in Vegas, let alone eat. In an effort to enjoy all that the city has to offer, I found myself here at Chang's one recent weekend afternoon, with the hope of scoring something delicious. What I had found was what I expected all along: an average run of the mill \"yum cha\" experience.  It's not entirely their fault, after all Las Vegas isn't overrun with a Chinatown that isn't filled with seedy adult joints and gringofied Chinese spots without the support or demand of a larger community. Hence, the exterior gives away the experience ahead of time: a semi-cheesy palatial looking front coupled with a retro sign that screams Chinese Americana from decades before.  Inside the Dim Sum scene is within the typical banquet hall, with a few carts that make their rounds, usually a couple with steamed dishes and the others with more fried pastries and desserts. Once we saw the same 4 carts that approached the table and very few staffers with special dishes to give out, the experience and variety is going to be limited.  Everything from the steamed to the fried was bland. My beloved shrimp dumplings (har gow) needed some serious hot sauce before I could rip them from their mini bamboo baskets, even when the rice shell is dry and falling apart. The same could be applied to the fried pork dumplings (ham sui gok), which all of its glutinous glory was puffy and thick, but unfortunately was lacking on the pork part, skimpified on the guts side. All of the rice noodle wraps / crepes (cheurng fun) all needed some sweet soy sauce help before consumption, though the same can be said about the lo mai gai, siu mai, and fish + meat ball (ngau yuk yuen / lang yu kau).  A surprisingly decent dish? The stir fried rice noodle with sesame seed. Soaked in soy sauce, topped with a sprinkling of sesame seed and peppers, it was surprisingly flavorful and light. It was fragrant and the texture was silky smooth. It piques my curiosity for their other non-cart noodle dishes. To no one's surprise, it falls in the special price column on the Dim Sum receipt.",

PPP was obviously a better choice. We came in and it was busy. Dim sum carts everywhere. We ordered more than enough dishes but nothing was very good. I decided to order crispy noodles off the menu because everything just didn't impress. The crispy noodles saved the meal but they had a very distinct fried taste I've never tasted before on a crispy noodle. Maybe the oil was old. I don't know. They came with a ton of chicken and sauce so it made up for it but for 12.99 they were very pricey. We'll stick to Orchard Garden next time or finally try Ping Pang Pongs dim sum.",

    "text": "Pretty good Dim Sum for Sin City. But they only serve from 10am-3pm, seven days a week. After 3pm it's dinner only and they only have 1-3 dim sum items on the dinner menu. You can tell a major difference in the availability of parking spaces between dim sum time and regular dinner. But I've found its generally a good sign when I'm the only white person in a Dim Sum place. Which was definitely the case here. All locals. Came here on a Sunday (busiest day)!  *BBQ pork buns steamed & baked. Baked was sweeter because of the sweetness of the bread and looks like a regular bun. But I like dipping the steamed version in soy sauce more. *Sticky rice in lotus leaf (with meat/shrimp filing). You MUST get this one *Steamed spare ribs in black bean sauce *Shrimp Har Gow  We got 6 different types of dim sum + hot tea for $17.80 (for 2 people). It doesn't get better than that in Sin City! Only bummer was that we got full before they brought out the Steamed Chinese Broccoli + Oyster Sauce. Which is one of my favorites :( ! But I'd say this place is a must for any trip to LV. Especially after dining at all the fancy smanshy places on the strip. It's also really easy to get to ---- just go down Tropicana (towards the Rio) and make a right on Decatur. Boom you're there!",

Despite that, the flavour of the dishes was pretty authentic although lacked a bit of finesse. Har gao were soft and tasty, and our just-fried crab balls were crispily delicious. Other dishes that were fine even cold were: sticky fried rice, turnip cakes, eggplant stuffed with shrimp. The pork siu mai were so-so in appearance and flavour, but the noodle plates we ordered a la carte (chow mein and beef chow fun) were aromatic and tasty. I think coming back during peak hours would ensure hot and fresh dim sum offerings from the kitchen. Not bad at all (and compared to North Carolina standards, is practically five stars.)",

    "text": "tl;dr DO NOT come after regular dim sum hours (after 2:30PM)! Service is HORRID during this time, but great dining experience during normal lunch hours.  Just came here again after usual dim sum hours. The place was a ghost town. After my last experience, I can definitely understand why.  I came here with my girlfriend's family and we were the only party there. To put it mildly, our party wouldn't be one a waiter would like to deal with. HOWEVER! It is still a waiter's duty to satisfy the customer! The moment my girlfriend and I arrived, her family was already there with her little 10 year old sister crying because she wanted to eat KFC for her birthday. Rather than alleviating the situation into something funny, the ONLY waiter working just kept giving our table glares. We were then given menus to write what we would like to have ordered.  I understand in regular dim sum you would receive your food whenever the carts get to you; however, if you I am ordering all at once for someone in the kitchen to make it, I hardly understand why my food would come out in 5 minute spans of each other. I found that strange and bad pacing of my meal. Our food was coming out slow, so I asked the waiter if our baked BBQ pork buns were still coming out. He then rudely claimed that he told us that he had no pork buns. In an ideal world, the waiter should have simply said \"sorry, we have no pork buns today\" and if I were to argue with him, then he could've justified acting defensive. Either way, he still didn't say that they were out of pork buns, but I digress...   The experience then went sour when little sister dropped her glass and then future-mom-in-law drops her glass. The waiter completely avoids the situation cleaning other tables from afar. He never once came to our table and say \"don't worry, we'll take care of that.\" These guys then lost their tip when the cashier said \"boy, your party sure was loud\" as we were paying for our meal. I understand that my party wasn't the best behaved at this meal; however, the guys working the later afternoon shift (after 3PM) need to learn customer service!  However the food was good, so we still left a 5% tip. -5% for bad service and -5% for bad management. I definitely have to come here one more time during normal dim sum hours to get a more accurate review.  In contrary to my last review my new dim sum places are now: 1. Cathay House (service improved) 2. Chang's (service seemed to have worsened during after hours) 3. Orchid Garden (STAY AWAY)",

I was reading one of  the Yelp reviews and it mentioned that they are the best Dim Sum west of the Mississippi, and they are!  I have visited so many dim sum in the East Coast and West Coast and even Hong Kong and I can say that this place is on the top of my list.  Every time my family and I are in Vegas we have to make a stop and eat at this place and really early.  I've heard about the wait, but have yet to experience it since we get there before they open.  Once we get seated I see the place gets filled up quickly within a matter of minutes.  It is your typically Dim Sum with carts going around, but what make it different is the freshness of the food and not too salty for my taste.  Even the dessert is not too sweet.  When I go there I usually get the steam buns, sweet tofu, congee and some chicken and vegetables.  My kids love their egg rolls and the vanilla pudding.  And, the best is the price!  It is very reasonable and they have it displayed, not like other dim sum place where they have it in chinese!  So when you go, get there early and enjoy.  I haven't been here for dinner I only rated the dim sum.",

When I clearly remembered seeing the small menu with all the prices on it when I looked up the restaurant on Yelp. he tried to bring us the regular menu and I had to ask him 3 times before we actually got the right one.    finally we ordered the Chive Dumplings which were cold.and NOT good..the Shrimp Har Gow were cold and pastey..Sausage Roll the sausage taste old..mixed shrimp and pork dumpling and it was pretty much the same.  We tasted everything then decided not to finish because I was grossed out..after 15 min we ask for the check and forfeited the 22 bucks and went back to Orchids Garden because my husband was still hungry.  Orchids is kind of run down too but they are always busy.  Guys stick with what you know.",

My husband (1/2 Chinese 1/2 Swedish) and I (100% Chinese) came here with our son (1 year old) for an early dim sum lunch. We have been coming to Chang's since 2004 but the restaurant is now under new ownership. We experienced the WORST, actually it was NON EXISTENT service. The hostess was rude when she seated us. She brought over 2 forks, ignored me when I said we do not need them and then slammed them onto our plates and walked away.  When we complained to the manager he told us the restaurant workers bring forks to Americans. This in itself is racial discrimination/profiling, seriously who doesn't know how to use chop sticks?!?!? Do Japanese restaurants bring \"Americans\" forks? Do Italian restaurants bring Asian customers chop sticks?   When it came time to pay our bill the same hostess who seated us point blank ignored our raised bill in the air and purposely did not take it. At this point my husband walked over to her and tapped her on the back to give her the bill. She continued to ignore him and refused to turn around. He tapped her again with the bill in his had and she again ignored him. When she finally turned she looked at the bill in his hand and refused to take it, letting it drop to the floor when he handed it to her. At this point another restaurant employee came over and asked why the hostess did not take the bill. The hostess walked away and acted like it was not her job. When the other restaurant employee picked up the bill and came over to our table I asked her if the hostess is responsible for taking bills and ringing them up, she responded yes.  When we complained to the owner of the restaurant he said my husband should not have tapped the hostess on the back. Uuuuummm really? How else am I supposed to get a workers attention so they can DO THEIR JOB? Instead of being apologetic or recognizing the blatant discrimination the owner and the manager of the restaurant blamed us the customers for being a problem.   I will never come to this restaurant again and believe what comes around goes around. The food is mediocre at best and the service does not exist. We are from San Francisco and have never been treated in such a manner at any Chinese or Asian restaurant.",

    "text": "Been going here for years for dim sum and dinner. It's generally been one of the more decent places to go for chinese. Sadly, this era is long gone.   I won't be going here again.   You see, I've dined at MANY chinese spots from Los Angles' chinatown, Seattle, San Francisco, Orange County and just about any other major hub for chinese food, and, for the most part, have a tolerance for bad service, as, let's face it, the more authentic the cuisine, the more you can expect lousy service....and did I mention I'm half chinese? So trust me when I say I have built up a tolerance over the last 3 decades...  So yesterday, I attempted to place my pickup order, however, after 45 mins of quality telemarketing style dials, continuous ringing with no answer, I eventually gave up and decided to head down there to place it in person.  Thinking it was super busy, I walk in and there are only 3 tables being served in the entire restaurant! So I stand at the \"pay for your bill window\" for 10 mins....no one. After an even longer wait, a chubby balding guy wearing a white polo looks at me and walks past me, even after my attempts to stop him. Just flat out ignored me. Then a tall guy wearing a blue shirt, glasses and a bluetooth headset (obviously more for the \"look\" as clearly no one there answers phones) comes out. After being vocally forthcoming (pissed off) about the lack of attentiveness, being visibly upset, and emphasizing the need to pickup their phone (which he had no explanation for), he proceeds to take my order. Midway through writing it down, he notices someone ready to pay, so he abruptly interrupts me and says \"let me get him first\", and without my approval waves the customer ready to pay to front of the line! This after everything that has happened thus far in addition to expressing my frustration?!? As he's clearing the customer's bill he says \"I will get you next\". So with my patience all but spent, I wait....as he finishes up he walks out into the dining area and picks up a serving tray with sauces and as he's walking away says \"be right back and I will help you\"......WHAT IS THIS GUY THINKING?!?!   Realizing these people don't have a clue, I begin to walk out. As I'm about to get into my vehicle, he then starts chasing after me, yelling for me to come back. Now I have your attention? After being rudely ignored 3 times in a row? Too late. Unacceptable.   To the owner of Changs: FIRE THESE INCOMPETENT MORONS! Your food is not worth the lack of respect these two idiots have demonstrated! Not only do I plan to never return, but you can be certain I have informed everyone I know, and everyone I will ever meet of this awful experience. The food, which is below average at best, is not worth the   Fellow Yelpers: This place many years ago was decent, the service, quality of food and portions have all significantly declined. Sadly, you'll find better service, food and portions dining at Panda Express! Seriously. Don't bother with this place. There are many other chinese dining options worthy of your dining dollar!",

    "text": "It's Sunday morning. What do you do? For many Asian families, that means it's dim sum time. Practically every dim sum place in Vegas is ridiculously busy on Sunday mornings and Chang's is no different. Once 11 am rolls around, the wait time here can be up to an hour. Definitely get there early to beat the Sunday rush. After 1 pm, the wait times drop dramatically, but the food definitely isn't as fresh as the 11 am dishes.  While Chang's has all the traditional dim sum staples like crystal shrimp dumplings, meatballs, sticky rice in banana leaves, etc., there are two dishes that are really the cream of the crop here. First is the pineapple bun with gooey yellow custard inside. Pineapple bun is a circular bread with a baked orange colored crust on top. If someone at your table speaks Cantonese, then ask them to ask the server pushing the bakery cart if the pineapple bun has the gooey filling inside. Unfortunately, asking is about the only way to know whether the pineapple bun will be filled with this heavenly goo, as they also serve regular pineapple buns with no filling, and who wants that? The other great dish is their mango mochi. Simply perfect. The mochi is soft, lightly coated with coconut, and the mango filling melts in your mouth. Time just slows down when I eat it.  Chang's does the job when it comes to dim sum. No particular dish is really bad in quality, but outside of the two dishes mentioned above, nothing else really stands out either. Dim sum is really a social experience, and Chang's is a great place to hang out with friends and family for a Sunday dim sum brunch.",

I usually have dim sum in large group as this is the best way to sample all variety and have never been forced to pay a large party gratuity.  Oh well, food was okay, I guess for vegas. I personally will be looking for other dim sum places to eat in vegas especially if I am going in a large group. If it was just 3-4 of us, I may consider but in principle, I will probably go somewhere else.",

If you see the color of the chicken feet you  know that its not going to taste good. The rest of the food seems cooked too long and the service is slow.  I mean, I understand when you go to chinese restaurant you expect the service to suck ass cos thats the way they operate, but when you have the owner operating as cashier that tell the customer to pay upfront then you should just open a to go counter instead of a full dining restaurant.  If you dont know how to open a full seating restaurant, go slow, open a little to go place first!!!",

They serve the usual dishes all chinese dim sum restaurants offer with the exception of their dessert buns and oh were they good. I dont know what you call them in english but essentially they were white buns with the yellow sugar filling. That is the main reason why we'll be coming back. The other dishes were better than average and I didn't get a nauseous feeling after eating.  Maybe I finally found a chinese restaurant that did it right!",

The dim sum is always good at Chang's, although I have to say I was let down today by the dim sum with shrimp. It was at least slightly fishy tasting. I don't know if it's becuase it's not fresh or if there are other issues, but it was notable in several servings of dim sum. The rest was wonderful. Something I'd never had before was dim sum with whole peanuts (shelled, of course). That was different and excellent. That was probably my favorite of today. There was another fried dim sum that was all vegetables, most prominently scallions. Those two were my favorites today. Good dim sum is not easy to do. In addition to quality ingredients I think you need to be able to make it volume to make it economical. You can rely on Chang's for good dim sum.",

I got to try a lot of things for the first time, including something with shrimp and rice paper. (yeah, lots of foreign names that I have no idea how to say, nor spell).  Everything was also very reasonably priced.  I think that the most expensive thing was 3.75, but there were so many of us that we all got our full for under $10 each. :]   Overall, it was a really good experience, the customer service was super and the food was really good!",

Order everything from shrimp dumplings to BBQ buns to BBQ pork and roast duck...also got veggies and sweet stuff!!!   Now I'm from San Francisco, so I'm used to getting great dim sum!! Since I am in Vegas I didn't expect the dim sum to be that good but boy am I surprise, it's as good as some of the places in san francisco..  Four of the people in my group were dim sum rookies and they love it!!!!  I have been iffy of going to a dim sum places out here in Vegas but not no more!!! Will differently return to this dim sum house when I return to Vegas!!!!",

When my family and I first arrived, we were not greeted (even though we had a reservation for 6:30). when we did get someone's attention, the man who seated us (the owner) was extremely rude after we asked to be seated away from the door. Maybe he was just having a bad day. Anyway, I'm adding 2 stars for the lovely food, some of the best dim sum I've ever had. And the elderly man that ended up waiting on us was wonderful and very kind.",

    "text": "In my humble opinion, Chang's is probably pretty authentic whether you roll for lunch, dinner or dim sum.  It is definitely superior to the Strip offerings in term of value.  If you're from East LA, then you might find something to complain about like shu mai being $2 instead of $1.50.  Sunday at 11:30am, dim sum wait time = 15 minutes.  By the time we left, it probably pushed up to 30 minutes.  Most people are in and out of there fairly quickly.  Service-wise, I think that Chang's is slightly understaffed, particularly in the non-cart personnel for water / tea refills and bill settlement.  The workers look a little tired, so I would bet that this has been the case for a while and they probably don't plan on staffing up.  Another minor note is that the cart ladies are not very keen on doing the visual style of ordering.  That is, more laid back places will show you each dish they are offering up, especially if you are clearly not Chinese.   It was very handy that I knew at least my favorite dish names and that they could understand my non-Chinese accent.  I am sure that it hurt their ears, but I got what I wanted.  Hargow, cha sau bau, jiao-tsu, etc (damn, I forgot my Chinese romanization... and I am getting pinyin and wade-giles all mixed up).  I definitely recommend taking a native speaker or at least get your favorite dish names memorized.  Price-wise, it probably is more that the general price of food and restaurants going up, but I think that it is a bit on the higher side.  Overall, I would venture to say that this place is quite good for your dim sum fixed, though it is probably not for dim sum noobs.",

    "text": "I'm from LA so I am use to good dim sum standards. This place is no more than a 2.5 stars in my book, but because its Vegas and there is not much competition, 3 stars fits the bill.  The food was decent but definitely not great!.  We were there on a saturday noontime lunch.  The haw gow's skin rips off so easily.  The 9 veggie gow was awful looking and didn't take good.  The chicken feet was dark looking, not fresh, and didn't taste too good.  Egg custard was good,  shau mai was ok.  Their daikon cake was so so.  Shrimp fun was so-so.  This place reminded me of the Chinatown dimsum which was busy but the food was decent.  Overall, if you need a dimsum place, this is not bad.",

I asked before I ordered it!  and I thought everything we ordered was good except for the custard bun which was way too runny so they took it off our check which is unheard of in Chinese restaurants!  loved that it's so close, only a few minutes from our hotel on the strip. it wasn't crowded at all but busy.  it was Thursday lunch.  the place is clean and the wait staff were all nice. there was one cart lady that was a little pushy w/ selling her stuff & menu items but she's just doing her job, she wasn't rude or anything just pushy.  for 9 dishes we paid $33 for 2 people. we'll be back when back in Vegas. I like this place way better than Orchids!",
