Really a fun place, especially if you plan it to coincide with The District's outdoor entertainment (a guitarist the day we went).  Add in good service, to boot!",

Six(ish) tables total, so I hope you don't have more than 5-6 people in your party, or you will be eating outside if it's busy.   I tried the egg and steak burrito, the fish tacos, carnitas tacos, kalbi tacos, and barbacoa tacos, as well as the pineapple basil agua fresca. The best thing was the drink.  The egg and steak burrito was very heavily seasoned. And it wasn't a \"heavily good\" seasoned. The fish tacos.. while the fish was good and flaky (grilled - not fried), the sauce - or wasabi crema - was so overwhelming that you cannot taste the fish at all. I had to wipe all of the sauce off with a napkin to actually taste fish. The carnitas tacos were the best of the bunch in my opinion, and hubby liked the barbacoa. The kalbi was not a favorite.  I think this place has potential, but I think that some of the dishes could be re-engineered.",

This place is tucked in between lots of cool shops, bars, and other food places. In the middle of all this is a cute little fountain that kids are playing in.  It seems there might be hosted events outside on the \"street\" as there was a stage platform.   When my boyfriend and I first entered we were instantly greeted by two of the employees at the register (wish I'd gotten their names as they had excellent customer service). The ordering process was a lot simpler than I'd anticipated. They offer bowls, burritos, and tacos.   I ordered one of the shredded chicken street tacos, one barbacoa taco, and one carne Asada taco. Each taco meal comes with tortilla chips. I then got a house made \"Agua Fresca\" ( I chose strawberry lemonade) and it was delicious! The tacos were all very good (I think the barbacoa was my favorite with the chicken coming in close second). They each seemed to have their own flavors and not just some generic spice mix that went on each choice of meat. They were flavorful and just the right portion sizes.   They have red salsa, salsa verde, and habanera salsa available in a little fridge off to the side and each were very good.   Will definitely be back!!!!",

I got the Kalbi burrito, the meat was very dry and reminded me a lot of beef jerky. My friend got the tacos and described the exact experience. We tried all of the sauces, one was fine but none were impressive. What influenced the experience most negatively was the carnitas, it literally tasted like a gingerbread cookie. I'm not kidding, it tasted like it was seasoned with cinnamon and ginger, it wasn't eatable.",

Located in the district next to Green Valley Ranch (next to Lucielle's) it's more expensive than a similar shop elsewhere, but the food is fresh and everything was pretty tasty. I had the shrimp burrito ($9.50) which came with a side of tortilla chips. The jumbo shrimp were plentiful but most importantly - not over cooked. The inside is a little small and sterile feeling but clean. They have a trio of fresh salsas that are great but I wasn't a fan of the habanero - way too sweet.  Overall, a good place to visit if you're in the area.",

I wish we would have just gotten a refund and went to Taco Y Taco instead as their tacos are waaaaaay better! The employees apologized several times for the hairs we found and then gave us one free churro. The churro was not even that good, it barely had any cinnamon sugar on it.

You get three tacos in one order which is enough to satisfy hunger. You can also add some salsa which you can take from a mini fridge. I think they make them fresh because they look like it.   The service is okay. Nothing worth remembering but I'm a fan of the ambiance and pretty much everything in the menu. I have yet to try the juice they make but upon check in, you can get them for free. I was a little too late to redeem mine so I saved the voucher for future visits.   I also like that my order came with fresh nachos. It was warm and crispy which is just the way I loved them!   When you're around the area, I highly recommend going!",

    "text": "ME GUSTA ME GUSTA TACOS!  Some people may point out that Me Gusta Tacos is not authentic Mexican food. This is True, but that it does not sway you from experiencing these deliciousness tacos. I ordered the 3 tacos for $10 deal. They have a great variety to choose from; a more traditional choice like carnitas to a fun, fusion choice like the Korean kalbi. I decided on the pork belly banh mi, the carne asada, and the kalbi. They were all delicious! It was a close race but I have to say that I enjoyed the banh mi the most-- what a mouth watering combination with those pickled veggies and the cilantro! UMF. I also had a bite of the California burrito ($9). Instead of usual fries you find in a cali burrito they use tots which is fine with me. The tacos and the burritos are served with non-GMO tortilla chips (oh hey, fancy now).   When you dine in, you can go to the little fridge off to the side to pick up your own salsa bottles. There are three different kinds to make sure that everyone in your group is happy. Talking about things that make me happy-- they also serve breakfast all day long! I know I can't speak for everyone, but I can have a breakfast burrito ANY time of the day and my tummy will be happy! The next time I'll have to try the side order of corn. I love me some elote!  They serve agua frescas ($4) here. During my visit they had pineapple, watermelon, hibiscus, and strawberry lemonade. Make sure you use that Yelp check in for a free agua fresca with your meal. Sofa, beer, and wine are also options on the menu.   And you can't leave this place without trying a churro ($3)! They have cinnamon sugar, Bavarian cream, and caramel. These are filled churros. For the sake of trying something different, we went with the Bavarian cream and the caramel. My favorite of the two would have to be the Bavarian cream-- it was like a churro and a donut had a baby. The caramel one was alright, but it was a little too sweet for my liking.  Also note that this place has great service! The guy that helped take our order was friendly and even offered us samples to help with that important decision making. The food came quickly and he even made a trip to our table to help clean up our table and throw away the trash.   To end this review with a \"I'll be back\" would be an understatement. I'll be a weekly regular for sure!",

    "text": "3 1/2 stars but I cannot justify pushing this to a solid 4 star review. More of that in a bit.  I came here knowing this isn't your street-style tacos you'll find at Tacos El Gordo. I've read some reviews beforehand and many of you have said it's more of a fusion kind of taco. Okay, noted.  So I ordered the three tacos for $9.50: carne asada, Korean kalbi and carnitas. We also got a California Burrito-crunchy tator tots, cheddar, sour cream with barbacoa.  That burrito was great....lots of flavor...a lot going on with the tator tots and choice of meat. Lather that up with the green salsa and mmmm mmmm good! My carne asada and Korean kalbi tacos were delicious. This probably would have been a 4 star review if I got those two tacos alone. But the mood killer was the carnitas taco. Plain and flavorless....no matter how much salsa I put on that thing....the taco just cannot be saved. What a shame.  Three different kind of salsas. Spice level comes in mild, medium and habanero hot. I love allllll things spicy and that was scorching hot! Be careful, it won't hit you at first so you put another layer on your food and them boom! The pain and fire in your mouth!!!!!!! Lesson learned, just go easy on that. Our fav was the green salsa; 6/10 in spice level.   Checking in on Yelp gives you a free aqua fresca. I had the pineapple basil. Yum! One drink per party...unless you get a generous cashier like some people here, you get a free drink per guest. Didn't happen to me.  And I agree with some Yelpers...this place just isn't worth the hype. Mediocre tacos. I may give it one more shot and order their stacked tator tots.",

As soon as you walk in, granted there is no line, you get greeted by the friendly staff.  You walk up and order and take a number to your seat.  Seating is limited inside, since it's a smaller place.  But granted the weather is nice, they do have outdoor seating.     This place gets busy, especially on the weekends, since families enjoy the water feature as well as the good eats.    Let's get to the good stuff:  THE FOOD.  TACOS:  CARNITAS Marinated Slow Cooked Pork, Pico de Gallo, Avocado  PORK BELLY BANH MI Grilled Pork Belly, Vietnamese Slaw, Cilantro The luscious pork belly and the sweet and salty pickled slaw went perfectly together.  One of my faves!   BARBACOA Slow Cooked Shredded Beef, Diced Onion, Cilantro Pretty good.  Wanted more of a kick.  So with the addition of their yummy sauces it was on point.  KOREAN KALBI Marinated Korean Steak, Asian Cabbage Slaw Another one of my favorites.  Who doesn't love a bit of ko-mex fusion!!  CHARBROILED CARNE ASADA Traditional Marinated Steak, Pico de Gallo, Queso Fresco This one was a but disappointing.  Not as bold as the other tacos.    FISH Sustainable Fish, Cabbage, Cilantro, Wasabi Crema Tender fish with he crispy cabbage, very good fish taco.    *SHRIMP CEVICHE with chips Disappointing.  A bit bland and it had more veg filler than any shrimp.  Very little shrimp.    The agua frescas were refreshing and different.  So yummy!!!!   We had the pineapple basil and watermelon. So so so good.  Definitely must try.   5 stars for service   3.5 stars for food  5 stars Agua frescas   3 stars for price.",

They serve your food with the plainest tortillas chips for the side. The burrito isn't huge. I would have to order 2 burritos to be satisfied. I wish they would add something extra. I mean I'm almost paying 10 bucks for a burrito menu and I get plain boring tortillas chips on the side. Feels like a high school lunch at a cafeteria. However the meats are tasty just portioned small. Something for people with no appetites. So don't be coming here expecting monster size burritos.",

    "text": "Got the standard 3 taco plate and a drink.  One hidden gem that the menu does not have (or maybe I missed it) is the ability to mix and match tacos.  Genius!  A little on the pricey side (3 tacos for $9.50) and the tacos are relatively small (3 bites and the taco is gone).  Quality is outstanding, flavors are full and rich, and each taco is uniquely presented.  From the moment you walk in, it is very vibrant, classy, and modernistic.  The right wall has an interesting decor choice with various wall pots with plants placed all around.  Interior is a bit small and cramped, but building itself is not very big.  A few times, the booth next to me had to get up and squeeze out, but I had to slide my table to give them more room, but it blocked the table on the other side in.  Overall location is a little tricky to find.  It is NOT along the main road; you have to go into an alley and it's the 2nd business in.  Signage is good and helps point it out.  At the register, if there is a line and another associate, they will leave the counter with a tablet and take the order of the next person in line.  Very convenient!  I will have to come again and try the burritos.  Hopefully the size and portion is bigger, I'm sure the quality will still be the same.  This visit I got shredded chicken, fish, and Korean taco.  My only concern (other than size), is the fish taco looked more like a small fish stick placed in the taco, and it did not even go from Edge to edge of the tortilla.  Still tasted good so won't rate low for that.",

However, props to them for the quality of the meats used, as well as how perfectly they are cooked.   I will definitely come back to try everything else.

I was excited to see some new places on the email and looked at the reviews, pictures, etc.  Decided to try here because everything sounded so yummy...and the pix looked pretty good too and I just plain LOVE tacos. I decided to take my employee as a thank you for all of her hard work. We got there and no one was in the restaurant...so we had time to talk to the cashier and make up our minds on what to eat! I chose the 3 taco mix and match plate. My employee had a spicy bacon breakfast burrito, we both had the watermelon mint Agua Fresca and I got a water and I ordered the stacked tater tots...$36 and change. I even tipped them the rest of the $40 I gave her.  The tater tots and my tacos came out together which had me just a little concerned....it took them just as long to cook the meat for my tacos as deep frying the tater tots??? The tater tots were suppose to have cheese, crema and guacamole. They came out with crema and guacamole and the cheese was so melted it was off the tots and on the bottom of the paper container. :/ So I waited to eat my tacos until her burrito came out. When it came out it was already cut in half for her.... so I looked at it and said ,\" where's your bacon?\" She said oh it's there, took a few bites, no bacon, a few more bites, crumbles of bacon. It was so stuffed with eggs and tater tots but barely any bacon. I bit into my 1st taco, which was the Asian one, the meat was COLD, chewy and just tasteless. I couldn't chew the meat so I had to spit it out. I pulled out a piece of meat and felt it to see if in fact it was cold or if it was just the Asian slaw on it....NOPE meat was cold. Tasted like it was last night's. So then I pulled out a piece of meat from my 2nd taco, Carne asada. COLD...I handed it to my employee and said is it just me or is that cold? She took it and said no...it's COLD! so by this point I am done. Don't even care if 3rd taco is done.  Not only all of that but the salsa is not salsa, no heat, no flavor, so watered down that when I 1st went to use it, nothing but clear liquid came out. So...something I never do...I asked for my money back for the tacos, I really should have asked for the tater tot back too ...and for an all egg burrito it was $9. If I could make this a -star....I would. Sad. Sad day for tacos! I will not be back...",

    "text": "Not bad.  I had 3 tacos and the stacked tater tots.  Fish taco was a grilled white fish with wasabi cream, slaw, and cilantro.   I thought it was pretty good on a healthier play on a fish taco.  I used the habanero sauce on this one which paired nicely with the fish.  Even though the sauce is rated a 9 in heat level by Me Gusta, it was mild as far as hot sauces go.  Chicken taco was flavorful but unremarkable tbh.  I used the green sauce with this one.  Lastly I had the carne Asada taco where the beef was tender and it had a different flavor than your typical carne Asada.  I used the red sauce which is the most mild so I could taste the flavor of the beef better.  Tater tots were what you would expect with some guacamole, cheese, and sour cream.  Overall a good attempt in doing a slightly healthier Mexican concept with an Asian slant.  Clean fast-casual spot inside the District",

Not to mention those stacked tots, that's something to cry for. (Happy tears of course)  What compelled me to write this post was not the food (even though it deserves its own post) it was the quality of service. My burrito came out slightly later than the rest of the food that was served at my table so, a few minutes after getting my food, I was approached with an apology and an offer for a complimentary drink. SAY WHAT? That's right, this place is set with such high standards waiting even 5 more minutes is unacceptable. I really had no intention to complain, in my opinion, it wasn't even that long of a wait. But, the fact that I was approached was a breath of fresh air.   EVERYTHING about this place is awesome. Your tastebuds will thank you twice over for putting this restaurant at the top of your list!",

    "text": "Muy bueno is an understatement, this spot got me hooked in just one visit. The staff upfront was very friendly and gave me the scoop on the different types of tacos and burrito's. I caught the 3 tacos for 9.95 deal on the menu so that's what I got. I opted for the Carne Asada, Pollo, & to my surprise they had pork belly bahn mi (which i love ) and to have it in taco form was amazing. The 3 taco deal comes with a side of chips and there are 3 salsa variations in a fridge so whether you like mild or caliente there is a salsa for everyone. After the taco feast i inquired about the churros which are stuffed with filling. I grabbed a caramel one which was delightful and picked the brain of the guy up front on what I should try for my next visit. I got to sample the Kalbi which tasted great so that's on my radar for next time. Also interestingly enough they do serve Breakfast ALL DAY! :D, and the Breakfast burritos are calling my name for the morning. Bonus: get a free agua fresca with a yelp check in!",

Besides the amazing food, they keep their menu nice, simple and not over crowded with a million items that are essentially the same product, only with one tiny change to build an unnecessarily large selection. Contrary, each item is uniquely designed to its own perfection.  I haven't tied the full menu, but I'm on a mission.   Finally, the staff. Man, it's great to have a bunch of people that seem to be happy to be at work together. Seriously, 90% seems like they may be an owner the way they interact with the customers and are constantly doing little things to make the Me Gusta Taco experience better.",

Someone responsible for this location has done their homework.  The carne asada has a properly smokey flavor, the green salsa is very tasty, the ingredients in the burritos are appropriate to their inspiration, and the staff is pleasant.  These are the nice parts.  The trouble with this location is that the food just kinda sucks.  The burritos contain about 2oz of protein, and are pretty unsubstantial.  California and mission burritos should be the size of your forearm, these are about the size of a small Del Taco burrito.  The ratios of the burritos are way off,  Way too much cheese, way too little meat, and just poor execution all the way around.  This uninteresting food in coupled with a price tag that would accommodate much grander fare.  The price for what you get is just ridiculous.",

    "text": "This is my first time trying mi gusta tacos. The place is small but charming. Coming from Los Angeles, tacos are indeed a comfort food and a nostalgic eating experience for me and my wife. We recently moved here and we really haven't found that taco eating experience yet. And unfortunately, mi gusta tacos didn't win us over completely.   Before we get to my cons let's explore the pros!  -the pork belly bahn mi taco is probably my favorite from what we ordered.  -the pineapple basil Fresca was refreshing and delightful. -the service is very friendly and patient, since this was my first time.  -their salsas are flavorful, I personally like the salsa verde. -the atmosphere is charming and indeed a hip place to dine.   With so much good, I was surprised to find some not so good things with mi gusta tacos.  -their rendition of a carne asada tacos just sort of missed my taste buds. It wasn't chopped up and grilled like I've grown to love my tacos. Grant it I know this is a fusion type of eatery, but it just was a little odd to eat a soft and mushy taco... - the fish taco was bland, even with their wasabi crema -the Korean kalbi, was indeed a significant let down, as the flavor rose to excite my taste buds, it left them wanting more...it was indeed an anticlimactic experience. -I also got a California burrito, which had tater tots instead of French fries. I liked the idea, but again the sour cream, mild cheddar and the \"crunchy tater tots\" just fell flat on the flavor. It's was filling, but I wasn't satisfied.   I think mi gusta tacos are taking steps in some bold directions. I appreciate this, but I feel some ideas look better on paper than in your mouth. I will definitely try them out again, solely for their super awesome service.  I give mi gusta tacos 3 stars. Hopefully, next time I'll be more in love with the taste of their food, over their amazing and inviting service.",

I got them with soft corn tortillas.  The Agua Fresca Strawberry Lemonade was refreshing & not too sweet. For desert I had a Cinnamon Sugar Churros & a Caramel Churros with a Hibiscus flavored Sangria. The Caramel Churros has a creamy center which was yummy. Both Churros were freshly made, nice & hot. The Hibiscus Sangria hit the spot! Service was good. The 2 counter people smiled & were very attentive. And the owner Li was also nice. The restaurant was clean. I do recommend it.",

This place is a perfect lunch spot for health conscious people.  I had Me Gusta Bowl with Carne Asada. This bowl came with a lot of garlic flavored lean steaks, shredded red cabbages, corns, and five thinly sliced avocados on top of generous portion quinoa. Came with green lemony, citrusy sauce on the side but I used their habanero salsa instead. It was orange flavored salsa (spice level 9). Went perfect with the Carne Asada!! Next time, I will order this bowl without the corns. Then, it would be the perfect low carb, high protein bowl for me :-)  I had samples of their Agua Frescas. Mmmm, sweet but very refreshing. I liked the watermelon mint flavor. All four flavors are very sweet but the sweetness is from natural fruits. They don't add sugar to their Agua Frescas. Nice. This would be a perfect refreshing drink for me after I sweat my ass off at the gym!! Can't wait.  The service was nice and helpful. I love this new Mexican spot. Probably the healthiest Mexican option in Henderson!!   *(Personal note) I got garlic breath after eating this bowl.  (Very strong garlic taste in my mouth till I got home and brushed my teeth.) Next time, don't forget to bring mint gums or mint tablets.",

I chose the carne asada meat and it was flavorful and tender. I didn't care for the chips though that came as the side. They were pretty bland. I had to doctor those up pretty good with one of the salsas that were located in bottles up front. Also tried the cinnamon sugar churro as \"desert\" and that was muy delicioso!

    "text": "I've enjoyed these tacos more the last few days then when I first tried them. It's not your typical taqueria...it's in Green Valley remember? Their tacos are perfectly suited for the District crowd IMHO, since they offer the very basic shredded chicken taco for friends like Susan & Phil who think Sriracha is exotic, to a more unique flavor twist like the Korean Kalbi taco and Pork Bellytaco. I love the fact I can mix & match different meats for my taco...chicken, carnitas, barbacoa, kalbi, pork belly, etc. Their 3 choices of salsas range from mild to you'll need to order another agua fresca to cool your burning mouth habanero. I find myself going back between the green and habanero salsa quite a bit. It will also linger well into the next morning no matter how much mint gum you chew. The freshness of the tacos and the excellent service...the very nice guy who always remembers everyone...is the best part of this place. What better way to spend the afternoon than eating delicious tacos, drinking refreshing agua frescas watching kids run in & out of the splash pad? Me Gusta Mucho!",

    "text": "Since moving here to vegas back in the beginning of 2018, I'm also on the hunt for new places to try! I work at Green Valley District and some of my coworkers had been telling me about Me Gusto Tacos so i decided to try them out!  Here's what i ordered: 1 chicken taco 1 fish taco 1 steak taco  It came served with chips and had 3 different salsas to chose from.  A red salsa, a green salad, and a habanero salsa. ALL OF THEN WERE GREAT! even the habanero one wasn't overpowered with spice from the habaneros but it did provide a good punch. The chips were fresh, salty, and crispy.  The customer service was amazing. It's a small shop so you'd expect this kind of thing but some places don't deliver. I mentioned that it was my first in and after i ordered i was offered a free strawberry lemonade or another soft drink because i had come in to try them out! That was very nice and I wanna saw i appreciate it!  Now the most important part, the tacos!! Like i said above, i ordered three different tacos, let's talk about the fish first. Everything on that taco was delicious including the wasabi cream sauce which was light and not hot at all! However the cabbage seemed dry and plain, it was also at the bottom of the taco which i thought was strange. I wish the cabbage had something else to it because it would've been a truly great taco. Next, the chicken taco. To be honest i did not like this taco, i feel like i could've made this taco with 10 minutes in my kitchen. The chicken was tender but was bland. The cheese was just some basic cheddar cheese on top with tomato's and avocado which both seemed like they were too big for the taco. Finally the steak, the flavors were really good. I can't really remember what came on this exactly but i do remember liking the flavors of the taco   Overall: Customer service 5 stars Chips and salsas 5 stars Tacos 3 stars  I will definitely be back to try their burritos!! 4/5 stars.",

Located at The District at Green Valley Ranch, Me Gusta Taco creates unique flavors that you won't find elsewhere. You have the option of ordering tacos, burritos, and other Mexican eats such as nachos. There are a variety of sauces available ranging from mild to super hot. I forgot the name of the flavor, but I really enjoyed indulging in my meal with the green sauce. Everything that I have ordered has been carefully cooked and provided me with a satisfying stomach and happy mind!  The stacked tator tots are my favorite. The tator tots are actually crispy (I have had bad experiences at other restaurants where it was soggy) and it's presented like a nacho dish with cheese, guacamole, sour cream, and your choice of meat (the chicken was on point).   The fish tacos and chicken tacos were also amazing. The cilantro on the fish taco was especially a nice addition.   On top of the delicious food, the service is always 10/10. Travis is always knowledgeable and patient as I try to make a decision about what to choose from the menu. Everyone always has a smile, which is always a great addition to great food!",

I wasn't impressed with either as far as how tough the meat was, but the flavor is terrific! They don't deserve a 4 star, but certainly not a 3.",

    "text": "It was taco Tuesday so my friend and I were looking to try a new Mexican place. The reviews and menu made this place look good. The place is small, clean, and the staff is very friendly. They have 3 salsas that are house made, the verde and roja both are quite good, the habanero is just way too sour, its sad because if it was just a little acidic it would be very good. I soon found after this that everything here has the potential to be very good but there is something off or wrong that ruins the dish completely. I ordered the 3 taco plate, Carnitas, Asada, and the Kalbi tacos, all of which were very bad. The Asada had a very strange and off putting flavor, which I couldn't identify the problem. The Kalbi, which was definitely over-hyped, tasted exactly like re-hydrated beef jerky and was very unpleasant. Unfortunately for me the last one I tried was the Carnitas, which was one of the worst things I have ever eaten. It had the flavoring of Gingerbread and was sweet. Suffice to say I will not be returning, but I hope the owner reads this, takes this review seriously, and heavily considers changing the preparations on all the meats here. I am saying this as constructive criticism, not to bring him or this place down, I feel with such adjustments this place can turn from a 1 star to a 4-5 star with ease.",

My friend had told me a buddy of ours sold their ownership of crepe shake to open up this family operated restaurant at the district in Henderson. Now the district maybe a few years ago was a desolate, dying area but now has been revitalized with cool bars, and some remodeling, but with the appearance of Me gusta, this place has gotten only stronger.  Setting: Located right in the center of the district by due & proper, come in to the clean yet compact restaurant interior. The seating inside is sparse but there are tables outside that the employees will bring to you. Complimentary water is served via a spout inside the restaurant, bathrooms in a hallway right by the restaurant, and incredible sauces that you just can't pass up in a mini fridge.   Food: Originally wanting tacos I found myself opting for this Kalbi California burrito. Kalbi meat prepared by the family's korean recipe, crispy tater tots, cheese and creama almost sounds a bit void of the usually ingredients in a burrito; in fact this is more of a loaded quesadilla in my opinion. BOMB! The sweetness of the meat, mixed with the crispiness of the tater tots with the smoothness of the cheese and cream create a wonderful combination.  Sauces: Green Sauce: Sweet, light, refreshing, and a good kick of cilantro. (My favorite) Yellow Sauce: Sweet and very spicy, I warn you to be careful and only try when added to the food (also very good) Red sauce: for next time!  Overall: A regular spot for me, lets grab lunch?",

But I have fun google translating the Spanish and I definitely agree with Me Gusta Tacos.   I was lured in here through Instagram and the California Burrito with the kalbi ribs and tater tots. We literally drove from one end of the city to the other to try this menu. They did NOT disappoint! They were very helpful and had patience for us to ask about the menu first (which is rare and must be super annoying). Now, I love tater tots, but these were the BEST tater tots I ever had. The Stacked Tater Tots were amazing! The California Burrito was delicious and the kalbi was flavorful, such a perfect combo. Definitely try their agua frescas to wash your meal down, like the Watermelon Mint. The Churros are MUST and a take home treat, because you WILL leave here stuffed. And when midnight hits and you are standing in front of the fridge looking for snacks, you will be disappointed you didn't take the churros to go!",

Buy them individually 3.50 ea or mix em up a trio for under ten bucks!  Love that corn tortillas are made in house every morning.    While I love traditional style tacos drowned in sauces and cheeses it's a welcome change of healthy and cleaner eats you'll love here. Fresh ingredients, colorful veggies, herbs  grains, and spices  that add great flavor!  My favorite go to is the Me Gusta Bowl! Quinoa,roasted corn, fresh mango dressing, some of the main ingredients make up this delicious meal. I added Kalbi bbq to mine.  The serving size portion is pretty filling.  Enough for sharing or leftovers if it's for yourself.. more for me, since my fam and friends turn up their noses at quinoa.. I don't know why.. it's an awesome grain, good texture, gluten free, a super food!  Stacked Tater Tots rock!  Topped with your choice protein, and you're set!  There's also kids meals! AND Breakfast items that's available all day!   Agua Frescas!! Mucho yummo! Fresh fruits.. herbs.. ie watermelon Mint, Hibiscus, lemonade Chia are some of the drinks that the owner let us sample  ... oh speaking of owner(s) familiar faces.. it's restauranters Chris (former Rachel's Kitchen) and Li (Crepe Shack Waffles)They both sold their places and they are the ones behind the creative concept and own Me Gusta Tacos! That explains the healthier creativity!  The staff here rocks as well. Most already well experienced.  You may recognize some of their smiling faces. (Hi Vinny! of B&B)   Fast/Casual style Order at counter. Menu on the wall or grab a paper menu. Servers will bring out your orders. Help yourself to the salsas in the cooler on the counter.    The space at Me Gusta occupies, was the former froyo shop here at The District at Green Valley Ranch.  Transformation to this fast casual cafe is pretty impressive. Small, but spacious enough for hightops and table seating inside.  Seating also right out front with hightops or chill with the tables in the common area in front of the splash pad.  Reasonable and pretty affordable, they strive for high quality...It just got even cooler hanging out here!",

Light, filling, and scrumptious. Now, the tacos, I'm not a huge meat eater, but I tried each one of the tacos and dang, is that meat amazing! The flavor was fantastic and the quality was high. No fatty parts. I was majorly impressed. Especially with the Carne Asada. It was charred perfectly. Something this place also does well, they use ripe avocados! Nutty and delicious without a hint of the fruity flavor that an overripe avocado possesses.   I'm very excited about this place. They have beer, wine, sangria, and mimosas (on the weekends). You can grab a glass of sangria, sit on the patio and watch your kids play on the splash pad. Or, if you don't have kids like me, watch parents watching their kids on the splash pad, feeling grateful that it's not you.",

    "text": "One night last week my husband and I were looking for a quick dinner spot where we could enjoy our food outside. This spot popped up on my Yelp that day and I knew I wanted to try it out.   I love The District so that alone makes it a great location in my books. I also like that it's near the splash pad so there are plenty of tables around to enjoy your food.   The inside of the restaurant is simple and clean. There are about a dozen tables, but I'd recommend the tables outside on a nice day.  Orders are taken at the register and then brought out when they are ready. The employees were fine with finding everyone at the outside tables when orders were ready. The orders show up on a screen in front of the register so you can make sure your order is correct as you go.   I had a trio of tacos with chips as my dinner. The Fish Taco tasted fresh and the wasabi crema had a nice taste. The cilantro loaded on a little too generously. The Shredded Pollo Taco was simple and delicious. The Charbroiled Carne Asada Taco was my favorite. The steak portion was generous and very well flavored. I tried the red and green salsa and wasn't thrilled with either, but the tacos were great as served. Overall, this was a tasty meal and not too heavy.   Along with my tacos I enjoyed the Watermelon Mint Fresca and a Caramel Churro. The Fresca was light and refreshing. It can be spiked for a nice adult beverage as well. The Caramel Churro was really good and the perfect sweet ending to the meal.   My husband had the Breakfast Burrito and if I had to rate on this alone I would be giving a two. The burrito said it came with green chile which is why my husband chose it, but the burrito didn't have any green chile to be found. It was just egg, cheese, and a ridiculous amount of cilantro. I have included a photo of the cilantro to show the cilantro overkill. The tots served on the side were completely forgettable. This item made me torn on what to rate this spot overall because I don't believe in restaurants serving foods that they can't do well. Fortunately, my tacos were awesome.   There aren't a ton of taco spots in this area so I think this is a good spot for the area. Get the tacos and churros!",

This along with the friendly staff are the only reason they are getting 3 stars instead of 1. The nachos were burnt like you could see black on the chips around the edges. There was hardly any cheese?? Nachos need a lot of cheese!! I honestly couldn't believe they brought out burnt nachos... the black chips didn't make them think twice I guess?

The meat had little to no flavor and looked like dog food. Is seemed like all they did to the meat was put a ton of salt and sugar on it and nothing else. Really odd, gross flavor. For 40 bucks you would think that the portions would be at least decent but these were the tiniest burritos I've ever seen from a Mexican joint. You'd be better off going to Taco Bell or even Mcdonalds at that point. Even Mcdonalds patties have more flavor than the dry, salty, sweet dog food-like meat I just attempted to eat. (It was so bad I couldn't eat it all) Wouldn't reccomend to anyone who wants good authentic Mexican food, won't be going back for seconds.",

    "text": "READ ME FIRST:  I'm going to save you a trip and let you know that this restaurant doesn't serve Mexican style street tacos.  Instead it's a fusion type of restaurant.  If you're expecting delicious greasy Mexican tacos POR FAVOR look elsewhere.    Ok so now that that's out of the way... We ordered the 3 taco plate as well as a California burrito.  They have a variety of meats to choose from but we wanted the classics and chose carne asada, barbacoa, and carnitas. They also have Asian style tacos like banh mi etc.    It was a pleasant surprise to receive the tacos and there wasn't any grease or oil on the plate.  You get the feeling that you're eating clean, and well, that's about the only good thing about the tacos.  They just... lacked salt and flavor.  So naturally I grab the 3 salsas to add some flavor.  I don't think I've ever had salsas as bad as these.  They just didn't taste traditional.  The salsa verde was so off tasting and it's just upsetting because it's so simple to make... tomatillos, chilis, cilantro and salt. I don't know how you can screw that up but they did.  The other two salsas were forgettable as well but I had to choose the red salsa as it was the only decent salsa out of the three.  On the bright side, the burrito was fantastic!  They use tator tots instead of fries and I loved the crunchiness of the tots.  The burrito just needed salt but other than that it was good as is.    The agua frescas aren't flavorful and actually I didn't see horchata or tamarindo.  They have real fruit/veggie juices but since there was a lack of sugar I just didn't drink them.  The chips also lacked salt.  All in all I won't be coming back.  I love authentic Mexican and I also enjoy Americanized Mexican food but this wasn't good at either.  Salsas are a good indicator of how good a restaurant will be and if I was offered tortilla chips at the beginning and realized how bad the salsas were, I would left a tip and walked out.  DO try the California burrito, and don't forget to add salt.",

I have become a regular here and have yet to experience anything but excellent customer service. The staff here is extremely friendly and open to questions. They come around and pick up your plates and ask if you need anything else and it's not even a sit down place! I see the owner there often and he is extremely humble and friendly. All I can say is, this place is doing it right!",

Me Gusta Tacos serves your typical taqueria menu items, except with a twist! The tacos were calling my name, especially seeing as to how they offer items like the Pork Belly Banh Mi and Barbacoa tacos, but I knew I had to order the Stacked Tater Tots after seeing all the tempting photos here on Yelp!  For an extra $3, I was able to top my tots with my choice of protein. I went with the kalbi and oh my god, it was so good! The meat was tender and marinated perfectly. The kalbi was the perfect blend of sweet and savory. Beneath the kalbi was a mound of crunchy, golden Tater Tots covered in melted mild cheddar. To complete the dish, a good squeeze of sour cream and a nice scoop of guac were also added to the top. Stacked Tater Tots are essentially nachos, but way better!  My boyfriend ordered a carne asada California Burrito, per usual, and enjoyed it for the most part. Of course they use Tater Tots instead of the traditional French fries here! His only complaint was that the tortilla began to fall apart while eating it.  We also ordered a Pineapple Basil agua fresca to share, courtesy of Yelp for checking in! The employee taking our order was so friendly and let us sample the other flavors before deciding. It was refreshing! Me Gusta Tacos also serves a variety of beer and wine. There is free water from the cutest tap and also iced tea.  We both agreed that we made a good choice by coming here. The food was great and prices are fair, plus, the customer service was fantastic! I can't wait to come back and try the Bavarian Cream Churros!",

It is inconsistent, it lacks flavor and I have not found a place even though I have tried to have be THE SPOT.   This location is just like the others- it is Asian fusion and I came here with my friend. We tried almost all the tacos and the nachos. The barbacoa was the best thing on the menu. We tried all the tacos and some (short ribs) disappointed. Some (chicken and carnitas) were dry.   All in all, it was subpar to my food standards. Customer Service was nice and people seemed to like their job! I will not be coming back but if in the area will get the nachos with barbacoa.   Off to find another mexican restaurant that won't disappoint.",

What we ordered: the 6 tacos for $18 (pork belly, korean kalbi, carne asada, and barbacoa). All the tacos fully loaded, with the right seasoning. The pork belly and kalbi, soft and tender which also gave off a sweet taste. They also sell burritos, seafood options, and desserts.   We also both checked in and got a free agua fresca on one order. Best part is, affordable and better than other taco food chain place in town.  Next up, the bavarian churros. Will be back again!!",

The menu looks fun while there aren't too many options which is okay, but the flavors are just okay too good, nothing to fall in love with.  I'm a huge fan of tacos and the tacos here usually fall apart and for some reason the flavors don't come together that well.  It's also REALLY bright in here so not really a night time vibe or relaxing loungey vibe... The things I do like are that it's fast, reasonably healthy, and they have beer. There are some stools you can sit and eat at and watch the passers by.  When I'm @ The District I usually eat here or @ Crazy Pita, which is also good but not great. Everything else is too trendy or overpriced.",

I did not like their meat at all, they contained a \"stinky\" smell, I believe their meat wasn't fresh at all which is why they carried that funky smell. The meal was also kind of cold when it was served to us.   I definitely had high expection for the korean kalbi and it tasted just as disappointing as the carne asada. The fish taco wasn't too bad but it was cold. I wouldn't recommend this place at all. Go to Tacos el Gordo or Taco y Taco, they won't disappoint.",

The first time I went I was really hangry. The cashier was polite. Second time I was with family from out of town and it was convenient. Service seemed a little shy and stingy.  The third time was enough. I had 2 fish tacos and 1 asada taco. They wouldn't even give me an extra sauce for my to go order.  The asada was a bit dry, I couldn't put enough limes to hydrate it.  And the fish tacos, I still can't get that fish taste after brushing and washing my mouth a couple times.  I might come back for convenience. Probably in the next 5 years.  On a good note, I can finally take this off my bookmarks of places to try.",

Came here on a late Thursday night right before they closed. I thought they'd be a bit in a hurry to get us out but they were so busy working on orders for pick up they didn't rush us at all.  Heard a lot of talk about this place so I wanted to try a variety. They offer tacos for $3.50 a piece of 3 for $9.50 and that comes with chips.   I went ahead and tried the carne asada taco, fish taco and pastor(pork).  The asada taco was magnificent. Tender juicy succulent pieces of steak cooked perfectly. Grilled to the best way possible and served with onions and cilantro. A True homage to street tacos everywhere. I opted for the flour tortilla at no extra cost.  Next was the fish taco. A simply perfectly grilled piece of fish inside the flour tortilla served with a wasabi aioli and shredded cabbage with some cilantro. Very well done but I'm a fan of the Baja style where it's a chunk of white cod fried but this was exceptional by all means.  Last was the pastor. Perfectly cooked pieces of pork that had been marinated to perfection and served with a pico de gallo.  No wonder this place is so popular. Definitely a step above the rest in cleanliness and appearance. Still a simple taco shop but a safer and more inviting field.",

The service was great and the food was tasty. We got a shrimp quesadilla and a carne asada burrito. Both meals came with chips and we added a side of guacamole, which was really fresh. We also tried the strawberry lemonade and it was refreshing and sweet. The only thing we were disappointed in was they don't have white queso dip:( Other than that, it is really good.",

They have a variety of house made salsas to choose from to accompany your meal. The tacos came with a side of chips which tasted very fresh; next time I'll order a side of guac to go with my chips! The agua fresca was very refreshing and not too sweet at all. The staff were all very nice and professional, and the restaurant itself looked very clean. I will definitely be coming back here again!",

Tacos El Gordo and Taco y Taco tacos are not only much tastier but much cheaper and represents a greater value in every sense of the word. I'm quite disappointed given how it's expensive these tacos are. I wouldn't even buy it at $1 unless they improve the quality. Their habanero sauce is also similarly tasteless without the proper smoky fruitiness naturally present in habanero peppers.  Tacos from Me Gusta taste like subpar, overpriced tacos from the east coast. My apologies to the owner and cooks but there needs to be a serious revamping of the standard tacos.",

I also had a horchata.  And in all honesty it was good, but just gritty.  Way too much cinnamon!  I don't know if it was just the bottom of the barrel, or how they make it, but it was way gritty.  I was disappointed too in the homemade salsas.  Although the tacos didn't really need it, the salsas tasted rather plain.  They were on the watery side, and lacked complexity of flavor.  My Mexican friends tell me that the salsa is what sets places apart, and for me the salsa here was just a let down.  Too simple, and lacked complexity of flavor.    I will return here.  They really do make their motto of \"simple\" taste good!  Next thing to try - the burritos!",

Tacos come with some chips, but I'd order more since they're so good and you can add a side of fresh guacamole for extra.   The agua fresca is good, I prefer the strawberry lemonade. It tastes fresh and made from real fruit. Very refreshing.   The shrimp ceviche is really good. Good to share for an appetizer for two.   Churros are delicious and warm.   Definitely recommend this restaurant!",

I've had both bowls and tacos with almost all the meats, barbacoa is ok and same with the chicken, but kalbi in my opinion has the most flavor. The me gusta bowl is delicious and you can choose your meat and comes with avocado and red cabbage and mango which adds a nice sweetness. They also make delicious churros that are the perfect texture. Overall pretty solid stuff, almost perfect.       4.5/5",

The tacos lacked flavor and the Korean kalbi tasted like teriyaki beef jerky. So they weren't my favorite. BUT I did enjoy the tater tots nachos. They don't have a soda fountain, they have some juices to choose from and a small selection of bottle sodas. It was a little disappointing considering what we paid for our meal, I guess I was just expecting a little bit more. If someone enjoyed fusion flavors, they might enjoy this spot.

These are fusion style burritos, not authentic Mexican, even tho i went w your standard carne asada. The meat was powdery/mealy, didn't taste fresh. Lacked the chewy bite of steak. It was similar to when you leave a lean cut of beef in the slow cooker for too long.   The salsas were ok. I appreciate that they aren't too spicy. Since I've been pregnant i can't eat nearly as spicy as i used to. The verde was rated at a 6 out of 10 and the red was 4. They both were like a 2. I was afraid to try the last one which was rated 9.   The chips tasted light and fresh tho, and w a Yelp check in you get a free agua fresca. I got pineapple basil, the best part of my meal. I am going to try to replicate this at home.  Service was cordial yet minimal interaction was had. The dining space is pretty sparse inside, so since it was a gorgeous day, we sat outside. My dining companion got the quinoa bowl w added chicken. It was a generous portion and her go-to when eating here. She had about half leftover to take home. I ate all my food however.",

The restaurant itself is open, light and decorated simply but tastefully with mosaic tile and there's plenty of seating at the clean tables inside and out.  We arrived as the sun was setting and decided to sit at the high tables outside where a colleague found us very shortly afterwards with our order.  The tacos were delicious!!! The meat is soft and pink but cooked and seasoned really well. Each are plentiful with meat as well as the other ingredients and the sangria mix was strong but refreshing and light.  Was so impressed! The only reason I drop a star is because the portion sizes are a little small for the price you pay. I have to imagine their location means their prices need to be inflated slightly higher than being somewhere else but for $10, we definitely had just a snack that kept us going in between meals.",

I was in the area this afternoon, though, waiting to see a movie at Green Valley Ranch. I knew Me Gusta Tacos was near by so I headed that way to check it out.  I was torn between a burrito and tacos when I first started looking at the menu. When I settled on a burrito I was torn between a California and a Mission burrito. One has tater tots and I do love potatoes in a burrito. The other has rice and gucamole.  I love rice and guacamole in a burrito more than potatoes so I went with the Mission burrito with carne asada. I also ordered an agua fresca, cantaloupe, as it came free with a Yelp check-in.   My drink came out fast. As it was brought to my table I was shown the salsas in the fridge next to me. I tried the drink first. Very refreshing. More cantaloupe flavor than a normal cantaloupe usually has. Not too sweet. A good beverage. My burrito came up a few minutes later. It was cut in half and I could see what was inside. Mostly rice. A little meat. A spread of guac. And some pico de gallo. But mostly rice. The flavor was fine. No one ingredient overpowered the others. The steak was tender but there wasn't as much of it as you might recieve from some other burrito places. All in all, not a bad burrito but a little pricey for mostly rice.  I moved on to the salsa when I finished my burrito and all I had left was chips. I wanted all three salsas, roja, verde and habanero. The salsa rojo was the most mild at a 4 out of 10 heat rating. The verde was a 6 of 10. And the habanero a 9. The roja would have been fine if that is al they offered but it is relatively bland compared to the others. The verde was sour notes of tomatillo and a little spicy kick. The habanero, my favorite, packs a punch but is not so hot that it is unpleasent. It has a delicious tropical fruitiness to it. Pineapple? Mango maybe? Whatever it is they use pairs well with the habanero and makes a very enjoyable salsa.  Service was good today. The agua fresca was a delight. The chips and salsa were a flavor packed addition. The burrito was good but not great. 3.5 rounded up to a 4 today for the good that outweighs the not as good. I had a good lunch and nobody can take that away.",

    "text": "Had a craving for some tacos one day and saw this place nearby. The tacos were pretty good. 3 tacos for about $10, but for that price and the size of the tacos it was a bit high. I've been to other taco places where the portions/sizes were bigger.   So I got the Carnitas, Korean Kalbi, and Charboiled Carne Asada. The Korean Kalbi and Carne Asada were definitely my favorite! The kalbi was tender and flavorful. The Asian coleslaw balanced out the sweet and salty taste of the marinated beef. The Carne Asada was the same with its topping, pico de gallo and queso fresco. Very delicious! As for the Carnitas, it was my least favorite because it was way too wet! What I mean is there was too much of the liquid pork goodness in the taco that made it hard to eat and very mushy. The tortilla fell apart after my first bite and the liquid was dripping down all over my hands. I know eating tacos isn't one of the eloquent meals and you need to get messy, but too messy where it ruins the meal and taste of the taco is not so good.   With the whole 3 tacos, it also came with some tortilla chips. Now that was very good. Warm, crispy, crunchy! I definitely like that it wasn't all stale and cold like if someone just got it from a big bag brought from some warehouse. So if that's the case, thumbs up for not doing that. (Dont quote me cause I don't know if it's True or not lol) Anyways, I also brought a side of guacamole. The guac came in a one of those plastic cups and it was $2.50. Again, for me the size and price doesn't really correlate with each other and I thought was a bit high. However, due to the restaurant's area it's explainable for the price.   Other than that, the tacos taste delicious and the service was good. They had three different types of hot sauces varying spicy-levels in their small fridge, but I couldn't find any salt or pepper. I wanted to sprinkle some salt over those chips after a squeeze of lime on top, but couldn't.",

Definitely recommend you try the delicious food. They also offer vegetarian options for those green eating individuals.",

The staff is great, the environment is clean and the food is tasty, clean, and consistent. I can always count them for a high quality meal at a decent price with fast service without rushing me to the bathroom haha.   In my opinion, the freshest tasting meat will be the Korean kalbi, barbacoa, and the carne asada. The fish tastes too fishy and the chicken is kind of bland for my liking. This place is very simple and clean. I love the food here for 3 reasons. Simplicity, consistency, and the fact that it's one of the only taco/burrito spots that doesn't ruin my stomach if you know what I mean. I'd rather not spend 30mins hogging the bathroom after a meal haha. I have a very sensitive stomach and almost every other fast-casual Mexican cuisine will ruin my stomach. So I love that I can enjoy this food and not feel GUILTY afterwards.",

They have all the classic Mexican flavors you'd expect, but done a little more refined and with attention to detail that can sometimes slip through the cracks at a \"standard\" taqueria. They also have some interesting fusion tacos that can't be missed- the Korean Kalbi BBQ is out of this world flavorful and a perfect marriage of the two cuisines!   The only thing that holds these tacos back from a perfect five stars is the tortilla; they are wonderfully fresh, loaded with filling, but often fall apart as a result while eating and that's a bummer. I also would like to see a bit more variety in their salsa selection. They have three options, all very tasty, but two are pretty similar in my opinion and the third is good- but it is SPICY! I can handle a decent amount of heat and it gets me sometimes. It would be nice if they had a more middle of the road salsa (heat wise) as the two similar salsas are more mild, but differ in flavor/texture a bit.",

You get to choose your protein, mine was Kalbi, and it comes with tater tots, cheese and sour cream. A small side of chips on the side and I ordered a side of guacamole. Kalbi had excellent flavors and I like the crunchy tots vs potatoes or fries. I wasn't sure about the pineapple mint aqua fresca before order but glad that I did. Not one flavor dominated the other and it was very refreshing. Can't wait to get bake to try more of their menu!",

If you are aiming for healthy, gluten free, etc, it's probably great. Add a star. But if you're just looking for delicious tacos and don't care about that other stuff, try Rubio's, Cafe Rio or someplace more authentic like Taco y Taco. They also have burrito's and a few other selections, so it's possible I'd like those things more, but they are supposedly known for their tacos, which I found mediocre. Most of the ones we tried were either one note flavors or the meat was dry and tough. The only one my wife and I both liked was the carnitas.   My wife and I are big on ambience when we choose where to eat. This place has none. The inside is stark, brightly lit and uninviting. There is some seating outside by the splash pad in The District, which can be nice for families, but we don't have kids and don't particularly care for unsupervised children running amok and screaming in our faces while we are trying to enjoy a meal. Call me old fashioned, but there it is.   I will give a nod to the service. Our server was great. When we didn't like the aqua fresca we tried, she gave us another flavor no charge. And when they accidentally gave our churro out with another order, they gave us two in it's place. For that reason alone, if I were in the district and in the mood for healthy, sustainable, responsible food, I'd try getting it to go and eating it somewhere else.",

Burritos - mainly came here for the burritos and had both the California, Anthem and Mission Burrito over several times.  California - Had both the carnitas and the kalbi burrito of this and it is very fresh and tasty.  Anthem - This is more of a vegetarian style burrito with beans, cheese and avocado and squash.  Also tasty, you really don't miss the mean and my daughter makes this her Vegan favorite by cutting out the cheese.  2.  Beer and Wine - Yes, I enjoy having a glass of beer or wine at times with my dinner and it is great that they have a license.  You can sit in or outside and enjoy the weather, the water park, the kids playing, the band when there is one, and eat, drink and be merry.  3.  The weather - We all know in summer it can get hot.  The best thing is that in the mornings, Me Gusta is positioned on the west side and they get a lot of shade, so it can still be very nice and pleasant to enjoy and relax.  4.  Agua Fresca - Interestingly, they have fresh water mixed with fruit, mint and these are very refreshing!  I have tried a few of their flavors. They make them fresh and they change it up and if you want a very cold and refreshing drink that is healthy, check it out!  If you are a meat eater, or a vegetarian, this is a place that has options for you  and they can make it your way.   GK Says, check it out.  It is one of our favorite places now!",

The restaurant is very hipster and simple. Only a couple of tables inside and the inside echoes so much that you probably won't want to sit in.  We ordered the California burrito which turned out to be pretty bland. There are salsas in the fridge inside, however none were at all spicy. The whole meal was just boring :(  Me Gusta Tacos is cute, but the food turned out to be extremely disappointing. They serve alcohol and fresh juices so I'll have to try that in the future. They have a lot of potential, hopefully things improve with time!",

    "text": "Me Like, You Like, We both like Tacos!!!!! Me Gusta Tacos delivers on providing mouth watering and healthy tacos.  In my opinion, they are serious contenders that puts them near the top of my list as one of the best tacos in town.  They also have enticing breakfast menu as well and is served all day.   I ordered a variety of tacos, all these were really delicious on there own.  The one commonality is the food tastes fresh and juicy. They make handmade soft corn tortillas, and the best salsas. You cannot eat a taco without salsa here, your missing out!!!  I recommend the Salsa Verde and the Habanero if you like spicy.    KOREAN KALBI - Korean Steak, Asian Cabbage Slaw SHREDDED POLLO - Chicken, Cheddar, Pico de Gallo, Avocado FISH - Sustainable Fish, Cabbage, Cilantro, Wasabi Crema CARNE ASADA - Traditional Marinated Steak, Pico de Gallo, Queso Fresco If had to pick a favorite its the Korean Kalbi - Korean BBQ in a form of a taco, my I can't resist that.  Say your in the mood for something sweet? The Venezuelan Chocolate Pancakes is heavenly and will satisfy your craving, just look at the picture.   Overall, this is a shot of adrenaline that Henderson needed. It's in a beautiful spot in the district, where people can relax and enjoy. Plus, the staff are pleasant and provide great customer service. Just by walking in,  wouldn't think they just opened.   I highly recommend checking out Me Gusta Tacos!",

It is the same price as Chipotle but Me Gusta tacos comes with chips. Highly recommend trying the strawberry lemonade.   I got the shrimp burrito, my boyfriend got the mission. The food came out very fast. You can choose your own salsa, it comes in little bottles that you can bring to your table.",

The carnitas burrito was good but the cinnamon threw us off, however the filling ratio on the burrito was great, you didn't get a bite of one thing then something different.. it was perfectly layered so you got a bite of everything with each bite.    Pork belly tacos= amazing!  Kalbi beef tacos= meh, ok.. kalbi I've had in the past was super tender and not chewy, this kalbi beef was very chewy and  it made the taco fall apart..   They swapped my tortilla chips for a small side of tater tots which was nice because I didn't want a ton of tortilla chips. Well, turns out they're extra delicious with the homemade salsas they provide..   I want to go here sometime and try the food at the restaurant.",

    "text": "Fun drinking game: take a shot every time a yelper playfully incorporates \"Me Gusta Tacos\" in their review.   AnYwHoO ~ Let it be known that the day I visited Me Gusta Tacos was the day I borderline overdosed on their delicous churros.   CARAMEL CHURRO ($2.50) - 5/5 - Me gusta tacos pero me gusta churros tambien! YES, i know tacos are in their name but trust me their CHURROS ARE DROOL WORTHY and you can choose from a handful of fillings! Pipin' hot, generously coated in sugar and spice - yup it's everything nice in a churro. Better than Costco 4 sho. I ate 4 of them and took a dank nap after~ no ragrets.   THE ACTUAL FOOD: As their wall states, their food is simple, but it's scrumptious.   TACOS - 1 for $3.50, 3 for $9.50, 6 for $18. It's a step above my normal taco budget but you're paying for quality bruh! OH AND FREE CHIPS! Raid their salsa fridge to douse your chips and you'll be a happy camper.  FISH TACO - 5/5 - I'm not a big fan of wasabi, but their wasabi crema that lubricated the fish married the cabbage and cilantro nicely. The fish was flaky and delicious. Note that it's grilled, not battered and deep fried like most typical fish tacos - good move for the health conscious. Handmade corn tortillas? - made all the difference!  MISSION BURRITO ($8)- 4.5/5 - Rice, pico, guac, cheese and your choice of meat - i got the kalbi. Love how they toast their burritos so there's a subtle crunch. Check out my pic, SUPERB meat to rice ratio!!! My only complaint is that I felt like the kalbi asian flavor was lost with the other components on the burrito - i wish they had a more asian flavors-centered burrito that incorporated kimchi and/or their asian slaw to complement the kalbi. Still a delicious burrito tho, can't deny that.  WATERMELON MINT AGUA FRESCA ($3.50) - 5/5 - Sublime when you overdose on their habanero salsa. Refreshing. 10/10 would sip in vegas heat. No artificial flavorings here, this is the real deal.  BONUS POINTS: - they serve local Vegas brewed beer!! WHAAT!  - potted plants adorned on the wall = totez instagram worthy!  - BREAKFAST SERVED ALL DAY!! - freeload off the Williams Sonoma free wifi hehheheh  OVERALL: It's a delicious spin on quality, fresh Mexican food that even your yoga instructor will approve of. TRY IT!",

They're huge, packed burritos and it comes with a side of chips to accompany the 3 salsas that are in the mini fridge.  (Must try the Habanero salsa!!!!)",

Three tacos comes with chips and a variety of salsas, all for very reasonable price.   Next up on my list is the barbacoa and the charbroiled carne asada tacos. They offer burrito salads and a variety of sides. I had the pineapple basil agua fresca which was unique and delicious. I would recommend this place to you for lunch or very casual dinner. The guys behind the counter are very helpful, ask them a question about the food or the menu and you'll get a great answer Enjoy.",

Interesting array of taco protein fillings but tortillas ripped apart and were not cooked well and it's not authentic Mexican food rather a millennial version of Mexican food.  I am not expecting a Lindo Michoacan  but I was expecting a bit more authenticity to their ingredients.   With all that said, the food is seasoned well and it has flavor and a healthyish flare to it; thus, I can see why it's an ok fit for Green Valley - District  folks.  I appreciate their use of recycled take out boxes.",

The tacos are made fresh,they are normal size tortillas and there generous with the meat. We each got three tacos and was a good portion. Also there agua frescas were delicious!! They have a good choice on salsas also with rating labels (1-10) which was neat i hadnt seen that before the habanero was definitely my favorite .Definitely will need to come back to try different flavors ( tacos and aguas haha) .

It's literally called 'I like tacos' and I looooove me a good taco, which is mostly the main reason I finally tried this place after all this time.   Atmosphere is cool and neat inside, with a modern upscale twist on Mexican food. I opted to try their tacos since this place is named after tacos. I tried the vegetarian, chicken and pork. The vegetarian taco was ok, the spicy mayo/sauce on top was most flavorful. The chicken and pork in the tacos were juicy, but not as flavorful as I had hoped. I took this meal to go and spruced it up a little at home with some hot sauce. Best part is having different options to choose from; 3 tacos of your choice for $9.   I also tried the side of corn and bacon, a friend of mine recommended I try this. They were not stingy with the bacon whatsoever!!! Bacon lovers, this ones for you.   Perhaps next time I'll try a burrito or quesadilla, something with a little more flavor to my liking.",

I came because it was close and was craving some spicy comfort food, but I didn't have great expectations. Well I was wrong, the pina-bassil agua was amazing, the habanero salsa was spicy and great and I ordered a bowl (not really mexican, I know) but the barbacoa was actually good, reminds me more to a good salpicon more than barbacoa, but great regardless. Looks small however I was full pretty fast without feeling sick. Prices are good, except the aguas frescas, they are very expensive. Service is very nice and friendly, will recommend and be back for sure!",

I dined here with about a dozen hungry friends after participating in a 5k nearby. Me Gusta Tacos is clean and bright inside, but it's a on the small side .There is plenty of seating outside near the splash pad though!   Service was really friendly and they brought our food out quickly. My nachos with carne asada added were super tasty and very filling. The ingredients were fresh and the meat was well seasoned. I also enjoyed a delicious agua fresca that was free with my Yelp check-in!",

Second, their 3 taco combo is an awesome deal at $8+change but keep in mind that the tacos are not small like I thought them to be.. especially the carnitas taco which is filled to the brim with delicious, smoky tender pulled pork. Not to mention that it comes with chips and salsa. I was full halfway through my second taco but NEED TO PUSH THROUGH! The KBBQ taco is very good-- kalbi is super tender and flavorful. I also got the fish taco and, honestly, it wasn't my favorite. Not huge on the spicy horseradish-esque sauce. The tacos each have their blend of fresh pico, sauces, and slaw to complement the flavors. I hope to try their Cali burrito next time.. maybe in a bowl?  I had Me Gusta Tacos a few years ago at a YELP event but never got around to trying them again until today and I do not know why! I'm adding this place to my go to list of lunch at work. Perhaps I'll call in my order because the lunch rush is REAL.",

You walk in and the decor is minimal, but very well done. The place was clean and there were some big tables on one side and a few small tables along the wall on the right.   The menu is well thought out and easy to read. The first thing that caught my eye was TATER TOTS! Are you kidding me?! Have all my dreams come True! I can feed my love for Mexican food and enjoy tots at the same time?!  So of course I opted for the California burrito, full of tots, sour cream, cheese, and your choice of meat!   Meat options are extensive, the options are: pollo, carnitas, barbacoa, pork belly, kalbi, and shrimp.   I chose barbacoa and I'd do it again in a heart beat! The meat was so nicely cooked- not tough or chewy.   The burrito came with a side of chips, and the cashier pointed us to a mini fridge filled with salsa and told us to help ourselves and pull bottles for the table! A great, less-mess, and fresh way to enjoy housemate salsas with your chips and burrito!   I wish we lived here just so we could frequently visit!   Needless to say we'll be back when we are in town! I'd have trouble straying from what I already ordered and loved, but their salad creations looked good, tacos looked great, and they have churros and loaded tots that I am sure are worth a shot!  Me gusts this experience and shop!",

    "text": "I hate to say it, but no me gusta Me Gusta Tacos.  I was able to sample the second location of this restaurant last year, and I finally got around to sitting down at their original spot in The District at Green Valley Ranch. Located on the same row as Brighton Collectibles and two neighboring bars, and now flanked by drinks and snacks spot Zero Degrees, this taco shop seems to be very popular on Yelp.  I did find some items which I'd order again if I bothered to go. Out of my order of three tacos ($9.50 for that count, $3.50 individually), I enjoyed the Pork Belly Banh Mi the most. The meat was tender and delicious, as was the marinade. I also tried two of the Agua Fresca ($3.50) selections and enjoyed both the pineapple basil and hibiscus, the former because it had the right flavors and was restrained in sweetness and the latter because it was also not too sweet and had a nice tartness. Finally, the Bavarian cream churro ($2.50) was a warm treat with both crispy and soft textures, and a pleasant cream filling to boot.  That's where my appreciation ends though. There was an overarching issue with all of the tacos: the tortillas, warmed or not, weren't oiled and cooked properly. They tasted as if you'd just grabbed them out of the bag. As for the fillings of the other tacos which I tried, the best I'd say is that they were not that exciting. The Korean Kalbi had nice steak, but the flavors was too sesame-centric. The Charbroiled Carne Asada read like cubes of soft beef rather than steak, and it wasn't sufficiently marinated compared to my favorite asada tacos in town. The Fish was the worst, remaining distressingly bland despite an interesting wasabi crema.  I did enjoy their salsa options, all of which come in squeeze bottles which you can grab from a conveniently accessed fridge. The salsa roja is really mild though, and I have no idea why it's labeled as 4 out of 10. The salsa verde is also not really a 6 out of 10. The salsa habanero lit my mouth on fire though, so its rating of 9 out of 10 is not as far off. Unfortunately, salsa needs a vehicle, and the chips on my taco plate were average and could've also come out of a bag.  I'll consider coming back to Me Gusta Tacos for some bowls/sides which I've tasted before. Also, I would like to have the pork belly again. That aside, there are too many issues for a place with Tacos in its name for me to recommend it over any of several authentic taquerias in town.",

Both came with chips (which we weren't expecting!) and they have a little mini fridge with 3 types of salsa to self-serve yourself: red (mild), green (medium), habanero (hot).   Everything tasted super fresh and flavorful! I loved the green salsa for the tacos and the red for the chips. I didn't try the habanero cuz I'm a weenie!

Absolutely awesome combination of flavors from their protein choices to their toppings and garnishments, and their complemented sauces!   My favorite dish here is the Surf and Turf burrito! The dish comes with some tortilla chips and is quite sizable. The shrimp pieces are large and meaty, along with the steak strips that are cut up and seasoned just right. I love the garnishments on there that you can add like the diced onions, fresh cilantro, and aioli if desired. This burrito has beautiful balance in texture and flavor and is not shy of the protein component. Great portions of every component to give it an outstanding zen. I love that they cut the burrito too to make it easier to eat.   Their salsas are honestly the best that I have ever tried. I lalalalove the habanero salsa with its subtle hints of citric acid and delicious pepper notes balanced with an undertone of sweetness. Absolutely delicious! Quality for a great price in my opinion!   I usually order from here through postmates, but I have yet to be disappointed when I add notes or side garnishments. Thank you Me Gusta Tacos team for astounding quality in food and service!",

Since my original dinner plans at King's Fish House didn't work out- I stopped in to try Me Gusta Tacos.  Overall the interior space is on the smaller side. There's about 4 tables inside, but since this establishment is across from the water fountain fixtures, there's areas to sit and enjoy your food.   I opted for the 3 tacos, mix n' match for $9.50. I ordered 2 carne asada and 1 Kalbi Beef. I love me some carne asada, and Kalbi Beef, so I started with the carne then had the Kalbi. If I can be completely honest, the meat here was super disappointing. First of all, the carne asada looked like cat food: dry, plus it had no real flavor. The Kalbi Beef also looked like cat food with no juicy flavor, dryyyyy. The meat also had a weird smell, as if it wasn't fresh. I did walk in 30 minutes prior to closing time, so maybe the meat was from earlier today- not fresh?   The chips that came on the side?! Meh, I've had better; some were crunchy, some were soggy- very inconsistent. The salsas, were okay. The Habanero (Yellow) has an initial sweet taste, then it just burns an uncomfortable feeling- I'd pass. The red salsa is super mild yet, the green verde salsa is not that bad. Of the 3, the green verde salsa is the most flavorful.   I'm glad I tried this place, now I know what it's all about and I most likely will not return for seconds.   I would drive all the way to Sharky's on Blue Diamond for some good Mexican Fusion food.",

The owners and staff are very professional and quality people. The food is always consistently good and restaurant is always spotless.  I've had everything on the menu and the only thing I don't LOVE are the chicken tacos. Just so plane compared to the other tacos that are lush with depth of flavor.

I would highly recommend this place for  anyone who is looking for a fresh Mexican meal that has a healthy spin. It was filling but not greasy! Their vegetarian option (the anthem) was flavorful and filling. I would highly recommend the freshly made churros! The customer service was also great - they checked on us frequently and allow us to sample the agua frescas. My only suggestions would be to have a few more salsa options and fountain drinks.",

They let us try the strawberry lemonade and the pineapple basil since I couldn't decide.   Ambiance: we opted for the outdoor seating which was enjoyable in the sun (screaming 2 year olds aside, but what do you expect being next to the splash pad).  I just didn't like the food.  I'd rather go to Taco y Taco where the flavor explodes.",

The other burrito we got was the kalbi burrito which also was delicious and full of flavor. We did a mix of three tacos, kalbi and pork belly mix, the flavors were perfect.

It gave me confidence that everything we were about to order would be done well, and for the most part, it was.  We were greeted by the friendly staff who happily helped us out with all the questions we had.  They knew the menu well and were able to give us the details that we wanted.  They also offered us samples of their agua frescas which they were very proud of, though I didn't really care for them at all.   Our food came out and it was good, but I felt that it was a little lacking in the flavor department.  I ordered the carne asada burrito, and don't get me wrong, it was a good burrito, but I really wished there was some flavor that made the burrito \"pop\".  It's had to describe, but maybe some additional seasoning or longer marinade might have helped.  I'm not a food doctor so I admit that I am not qualified to diagnose what would have gotten this burrito another star, but overall I was still very glad we came here.  As a bonus, we got a churro before leaving and it was fantastic!",

They made it a point to ask if i have ate here before when I walked up to the counter and welcomed me to ask questions if I needed to. I explained that I found there food page on \"@lasvegasfoodie\" on Instagram and had sent that page to my friend in Oregon to help make a decision for me! I'm glad I decided to come here. I was bummed to hear the Watermelon Mint agua fresca was sold out but after free samples I opted for the Strawberry Lemonade agua fresca. It only seemed right for this Californian to try the California Burrito: crunchy tater tots, mild cheddar, sour cream, with chicken and the added guacamole was a hit. I thought the chicken would be pieces and not shredded but it wasn't enough to disappoint me. Food is great, and people on here dissing fusion Mexican food should keep more of an open mind!",

Tastes exactly like the Anthem Charbroiled Carne Asada Taco- Both tacos were together in same packaging and tasted exactly the same.  Barbacoa Taco- Both tacos were together in same packaging and tasted exactly the same.   I am giving a 2 based on the price. My total was $58.00. I could have spent $12 at taco bell and received the same tasting items.",

A clean, plain and simple dining room just awaiting your arrival.  The service is served up with courtesy and kindness.  They definitely knew how to focus on their customers and give them an enjoyable meal.    Now usually when I eat Mexican food I need to be 'rolled' out of the restaurant from being so stuffed.  Here the portions are a good amount but not heaping.  That's great for me.  I ordered the Kalbi Mission Burrito.  It's served with a few tortilla chips on the side.  Me Encanto! The kalbi had a terrific flavor with every bite.  The meat was tender and abundant throughout the burrito.    The salsas they offer are in the little refrigerator on the condiment counter.  They were good but not great. A little too watery for my preference.  The spicy salsa could have been a little more spicy as well.  Good thing my burrito didn't need it.    I'm glad a fresh and flavorful Mexican place has arrived.  I hope you enjoy the same great experience I did.",

This is not a large space, can sit about maybe 20 people indoors and there are some tables outside too. It was super hot the day we ate there so we grabbed an inside spot. Our order was taken at the front and then the food was brought out by the staff. I had the three tacos. Two were pollo and the other was fish. They have three really tasty salsas to choose from and I tried all three. I was partial to the green one. I would have to say that the fish taco was really the best due to the creamy wasabi sauce. I need to go back again and try something new like one of the burritos. Overall it wasn't an amazing meal but it was good enough for me to stop by again the future.",

I sampled four of the proteins for lunch and they were all fresh and flavorful. You'll pay a little extra here, but that's where your money is going. I'm a fan and I still haven't tried any of the breakfast (served all day) and \"other\" items, such as the the breakfast burritos, me gusta bowl, or stacked tater tots.  For the shortest walk, if you feel like you're going to melt in the heat, park in the lot of the District that is closest to Lucille's and Panera and walk north on the alley in front of Lucille's. We came at three o'clock on a Thursday to a clean, open, simply decorated restaurant with no other customers. The employee at the register was very courteous and helpful offering some nice suggestions. During our meal, two gentlemen, who I believe were the owners came in to do some work, but they took the time to greet us and inquire how our meal was while lowering the blinds over the front window to block the sun from blinding us.  My favorite item was the Korean kalbi taco on a flour tortilla. The meat was seasoned well while still being able to taste the marinade, with Asian cabbage slaw providing a nice crunch. If you would like a salsa, you can pick it out of the cooler. Don't be afraid of the habanero if you like spice, which they rate 9/10. Although it did have a kick, it didn't phase me.  I'm ok with the $21 lunch for two. Breakfast with churros for dessert is on the agenda for the next trip. If you're in the District and in the mood for some Mexican, Me Gusta Tacos is definitely worth a stop.",

Located next to the splash pad, MGT is a good spot to get a bite while your kids are cooling off.  The Me Gusta Bowl with quinoa or a Black Bean Salad are both solid, healthy options with fresh slices of avocado- I prefer to add protein to mine, either Kalbi or Asada. At $3.50/ea I thought the tacos were just okay, heads up that the fish taco includes a wasabi sour cream whose flavor took me a bit by surprise. Most orders are served with a small side of fresh tortilla chips, which is much appreciated over the whole basket served elsewhere, that I always overdo and regret.   Attention to detail is a theme here. Even if you dine outside, staff will come out to check on you throughout your meal. The salsas are kept fresh and cool inside a mini-fridge rather than open and exposed on a traditional salsa bar. Don't forget the aguas frescas! Next time, I'm definitely getting an extra one to go.",

I ordered a carnitas mission burrito and after the first bite I tasted a very sweet spice flavor I did not like at all. For me, Mexican food should not be sweet, especially carnitas. I found out they cook their carnitas in cinnamon sticks which completely overpowered the meat.   I gave them a second try and ordered the California burrito with carne asada. My other half ordered the mission burrito with chicken (only shredded chicken offered). My burrito was good but definitely nothing I can't get somewhere else. The tater tots were a nice addition and the melted cheddar added much needed flavor. It was quite plain and needed a lot more spice.   The chicken burrito was also very mild and lacked any mexican flavors. An employee stopped by to chat with us. On both visits the service has been excellent and employees very friendly. He explained to us that they need to cater to the clientele in that area so all the food is made very mild. I could not disagree more but I don't own the business. Personally I would cook MY food and not change family recipes because of the neighborhood I am in.",

    "text": "I wish I had a five star experience like most reviewers, but I don't think I'll be back. I like the location, but I'd venture out of my 'hood to get some good tacos and burritos.   The small-ish tacos were $3.50 each or 3 for $9.50. Carnitas was salty and had just a sliver of avocado. Kalbi was on the dry side. Fish taco tasted fresh and I liked the wasabi. My husband thought his taco meal was very \"meh.\"  I was most excited for the California burrito, which traditionally comes with carne asada and fries at other taco joints. At Me Gusta Tacos, they use tater tots! I got mine with kalbi. The only other things in the burrito were cheese and a tiny amount of sour cream. Overall, the burrito was very dry. Even the house made sauces did not help it. Luckily, I had some avocado at home that I added along with some plain Greek yogurt (did not have sour cream at home).  Ordered my child a quesadilla kids meal ($4). Total regret. I could've made this better at home. It was sad. He took a couple bites and we tossed it. It wasn't worth saving as leftovers. For future reference, please put more cheese in it.  Another disappointment was that horchata was not on the beverage menu, since it was mentioned in the tips section on Yelp. Por que?!?  *****Yelp 2016 100 Challenge***** 33/100",

    "text": "They call it fusion, and that's exactly what it is. Don't expect super authentic Mexican food, but you can expect a nice twist that works. I usually get the California burrito with Kalbi or the Breakfast Burrito. The California burrito is nice because it has tater tots which give it a nice crunch, and if you get kalbi, the meat is slightly sweet and cooked well.   Sauces/Salsa- They have 3 sauces/salsas that they keep in a mini fridge next to the water and iced tea. Just grab one out of the fridge, and take it to where you're sitting. They go by heat level, and my favorite is the middle salsa that's green. It has nice flavor, but it's not all that spicy which is kind of a bummer.  Drinks- If you check in on Yelp, there's a free agua fresca which is really generous imo. I really like the watermelon mint. It's refreshing on a hot Summer day. Water is from a little tap/faucet next to the iced tea, so it  might be easy to miss. It's really cute though!  My only complaint is that the seating inside isn't super plentiful, but you can always sit outside where there's tables w/ umbrellas. It's not a huge problem.  TLDR- it's decently priced, the food is good, and the service is great.",

    "text": "Me likey Me Gusta tacos.   It blows my mind that I have yet to write a review for Me Gusta Tacos, but I've been here more times than I've actually checked in on Yelp. The venue is clean, bright and satisfying just like the menu, which is packed with burritos, nachos, healthy bowl options, stacked tater tots and of course tacos.   The tacos here are the bomb and very filling. My personal favorites are the veggie tacos filled with portobello mushrooms and the Kalbi beef. If you're not familiar with Kalbi beef, it's a marinated sliced beef that has a tangy and mildly sweet flavor. From what I understand it's the owner's wife's family recipe.   My go-to lately has been the California Burrito with Kalbi beef. Normally a Cali Burrito comes with fries, but Me Gusta's comes packed with tater tots, Kalbi beef, cheese, and sour cream, hubba hubba that's some sexy food! The crunchy tots, the sweet Kali, and the salty cheese, is a match made in burrito heaven.   Stop what you're doing now and get over to Me Gusta Tacos. You're tummy will thank you for it!",

I didn't try a whole lot so I can't really give a completely fair review but, what I did have was so underwhelming.  I had the Barbacoa and chicken tacos. Both meats were flavorless.  The chips were dry and seemed store bought.  The salsas were just ok.  It was kind of annoying to have to use the squirt bottle to apply the salsa to your chips and tacos instead of having a little plastic container to dip them in.  This place isn't terrible but definitely not good enough to make me want to return.",

The kalbi beef  tasted a bit weird to me. I wasn't really a big fan of the Korean fusion taco. The charbroiled beef taco was pretty good.

I ordered the Carnitas meat on my loaded tater tots and when I receive them the dish was sweet so I asked what the sweet component was and was told it was a cinnamon rub on the pork. Well I do not like sweet and savory together so I was truly disappointed and only eat a few bites. My daughter ordered the carne asada on her salad and the meat was flavored more like Mediterranean then Mexican food. We were expecting authentic Mexican food and the spices just did not pair well with the dishes. If it's not going to be traditional then maybe you should tell people I could have been allergic to Cinnamon I would never think to ask if cinnamon was going to be in carnitas.",

Decided to take our order to go as we were not feeling the barre group that were exercising outside and then clamored in line for food smelling of sweat funk.. Ordered the following items:  California Burrito with Kalbi Meat,  3 Shredded Pollo Tacos and a bottled Coke. Both orders come with tortilla chips.  Three different salsas are available to choose from, but be sure to ask for salsa containers with your takeout order - they do not provide it or have any out on the counter by the salsas, so you need to ask before you leave, otherwise you'll end up at home with no salsa to accompany your grub if you're like most people who don't double check your bag before walking out.  The tacos were great, but the lime pieces they included were super skinny and dry, so i hardly got anything out of those things...good thing I had salsa to help.  The salsa verde was my favorite. Hubby had the California Burrito - he said the Kalbi meat was not fresh.  It was super dry like it had been sitting out for some time and then just heated up as ordered.  He only finished half, before sliding it over my way and requesting to get food elsewhere.  I tried it also, but only a few bites - yes the meat is dry but the worst part was after taking a couple bites, I noticed a dark black piece embedded in the mix and my first thought was that it was just an overcooked piece of Kalbi - I scooped it out and it felt and looked like a huge piece of rock, it definitely was not an overcooked piece of meat.  How the hell did that get in there!? and such a big piece...this totally turned me off and I threw it all away burning the thought of ever returning to this place out of my mind.  Another disappointing strikeout.",

We went there for the first time and got the avocado tostada, stacked tater tots with carnitas, and the fish, carne asada and chicken tacos.   The only thing I was indifferent about was the fish taco. Needed some salt, maybe a slaw of sorts and some avocado! It was OK.   Tostada? I had a dream about it that night. Just avocado and radishes. I don't like radish, but I loved this tostada with some habenero salsa.   The chicken taco was so good. Great seasoning and not greasy.   Carne asada taco was great too - not greasy and was just nice and light and savory.   Tater tots were exactly what I needed them to be. Not heavy, not greasy, and their carnitas is so freaking good. Guacamole on the side was yummy too   I'd also suggest trying their flavored water. Fresh fruit and Stevia. Pineapple basil was my favorite!  I also liked that I could play in the splash pad with my son and they bring the food out to us while we play! Love it!  P.S. Everything is gluten free except the Korean taco, pancakes (I think), and the burritos (flour tortilla), and their salsas are delicious!",

They were so small, good for only about 3 bites each and at $3.50 each, that's about $1 per bite!   Maybe it wouldn't have been so bad if the chunks of meat had been smaller, but they were gigantic. No effort exerted to chop the meat up into proper proportions, given how small the tacos are. You have to wonder what these people are thinking.  It was $2.50 per side order of rice and beans, black beans at that, but the rice was somewhat under cooked, and stuck together in clumps.  Kudos on their homemade sauces though, that they keep in a small chiller. Good stuff, and if you like hot, their habanero sauce was exceptionally hot, yet refreshing.  May be a good value for breakfast, but I certainly would not repeat a taco meal. For $14, you can get much more food many other places.",

    "text": "I bookmarked this joint hoping I can explore the menu and try it for myself. Today is the day. Located in the heart of the District. I took my friends to try the tacos.  Since it's my first time at this joint, the girl at the counter just saw me staring at the menu board trying  to figure out what I wanted. Not a whole lot on the board but something for everyone including a breakfast and vegetarian menu. She  was kind enough to suggest that I can have 3 different tacos on 1 order so I opted for a fish taco, carnitas taco and the Kalbi taco, along with a pineapple basil  agua fresca drink. I am rating this place a 5 star!  Why? Clean, light, defined flavors. This is not your typical Mexican, fast  food joint where every food on the menu tastes some kind of taco seasoning, jalapeno,  with heavy, greasy,cheesy, sloppy stuff.  Have you ever heard of the saying \"less is more\"? This is the kind of menu. It is a contemporary approach to light and healthy eating and satisfying. The only thing that needs a little tweaking is on the Kalbi flavor and I'm hoping they can make it a little more authentic. Kalbi has a deeper, richer marinade flavor between soy and  brown sugar. The Kalbi taco I had today needed it. If your palate is up for an adventurous mix of exotic fruit, regular fruit mixed with herbs,  the Agua Fresca drinks is refreshing and exciting!  Maybe not for everyone! Taste test is a must! lol.  Super good! Can't wait to try the burritos next time. By the way, excellent customer service!  if you're seated outside by the splash pad, they continue to check on you. Thumbs up!",

The carnitas and the carne asana were okay but lacked some flavor. The meat was scooped out of some caldron or something and the juices just made the store bought corn tortillas fall apart.  I don't mind paying for good food but this was unacceptable. I consider myself a lifetime taco consumer and can cook a dang good taco as well. It all comes down to how much love you put into it.

    "text": "It's good...if you're craving mexican but the tacos are just ok. This place reminds me of when I was in high school and I thought I was making some of the best tacos around, not really knowing what good street style tacos were. The workers were nice. And I like that this place is in the District and allows you to grab a quick fix if you really want \"Mexican.\" I also think it's good if you really just need something quick for you and/or the kids but honestly you're better off going to Albertsons/Smiths buying some tortillas, salsa, ground taco meat and a lawrys packet. Pretty much the same thing. While it does offer some different choices in meats it's really just nothing to write home about.",

Flavor wise I just didn't love it and we probably wouldn't come back.  I liked the idea of adding in the tots but flavors just didn't wow me, kind of had no flavor.",

    "text": "Me gusta Me Gusta Tacos! They have a great location with indoor and outdoor seating, the owners and staff are on point, and the food is fresh and delicious. Their decor is cute and simple and their menu is the perfect size. The menu has a good variety and great ingredients without being overwhelming. Try their agua frescas: lemon chia, cucumber lime, watermelon mint, and fresh OJ. Their fresh salsas are flavorful: green, red, and habanero. We went for breakfast and tried the Venezuelan chocolate pancakes and the breakfast burrito with tots. The pancakes are decadent, yet fluffy with amazing flavor. The breakfast burrito has green chiles in it and the tots were crispy. I liked how the burrito wasn't just wrapped in an unheated tortilla. It was crisped up nice on the outside. Everything was great! Can't wait to try all the other menu options. They are located right by the splash pad at the District. Perfect to grab some food and hang out with the family.",

    "text": "Pretty decent americanized mexican food. Sisters and I tried the carne asada mission burrito, one of the breakfast burritos, chicken taco, and korean taco. Ingredients taste fresh, but doesnt taste much different from say Chipotle. The tacos were good but nothing special. Mission burrito was the best item and had seasoning that reminded me of Indian food. The steak in the breakfast burrito was very bland though. Food does have good size portions and come with free chips. The agua frescas were really delicious and refreshing. The girl at the register was very friendly and food came out super fast. I would give 5 stars for price, but food just isnt stand out. You also have to pay for $2 for refills, but hey youre in Henderson. Dont think I would come again unless I was in the area.",
