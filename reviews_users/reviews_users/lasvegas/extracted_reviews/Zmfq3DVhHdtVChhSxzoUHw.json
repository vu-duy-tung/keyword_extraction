The fried shell was soggy and the filling didn't have that wonderful cream cheese flavor they usually have. I don't think I can even give this place another chance. Such an unsatisfactory meal.",

My wife had the Garlic Garlic stir fry with chicken, 0 spiciness.  We had an order of fried egg rolls for a starter.  The meal was excellent.  I could have ordered a level 4 spiciness, but now I have an idea of their index of heat.  Andrea was thrilled with the amount of garlic with her chicken and the rich brown sauce with the chicken.  We ended the meal splitting the molten chocolate cake which was warmed.  I am really glad Groupon helped me find another good Thai restaurant and I know I'll be doing take out from here for the Garlic garlic chicken in the future.",

Medium spicy is not super spicy but still spicy. Good :D  I will also order the Wanton with cream crab meat. It's so good !!!! Last time I went there with my bf's family and we had 2 orders of this. 1 order come with 6 pieces.  Their thai tea has refill which is really good !!!!  Service is good too !!!   can't think of anything to write now since most of the time i just have the panang curry and wanton with cream crab meat lol !!  aww, ok, the interior design and environment are very nice too. And since their food's price are not expensive at all. Why not treat yourself with good food and nice environment?",

They won't greet you until after 10 minutes of staring at you like you have a head growing out of your shoulder. We sat down, waited for anybody to even come by and ask if we needed any drinks. So I tried to look by the servers and get their attention and they did look at me, but kept doing whatever they were doing which was nothing at all. It wasn't even that busy, maybe 5 tables and 3 servers. It's sad because I actually really like their food also my guy and I live right down the street so it was convenient for us, but man the service just straight sucks here. I'm a server as well so I know how these things work. I couldn't imagine doing this to anybody.   The food is great we always love coming here, or did anyway. However this happens almost every single time.. We just kept giving them the benefit of the doubt and chance after chance.. Even the people next to us, just 2 people, warned us how they've been waiting almost an hour for their food.. That's absurd.   We left and went to Archis Thai Bistro on Rainbow & 215. Always great service and we were in and out of there in less than 30 minutes.",

    "text": "Another Thai restaurant experience - lunch specials are the way to go I tell you!  First off, Panna Thai Restaurant looks a bit more upscale than your average Thai joint, which I think reflects in the price as well.  We walked in to a relatively empty restaurant on a weekday.  As the waiter brought us to our table, he immediately asked if we had any coupons (before we even sat down).  We did not, but apparently they do have a lot floating around and are a bit restrictive about how they are used.  I think they are also on <a href=\"/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2Frestaurant.com&s=c5fe485af4df376130bee54f875814d79c4d7913e1258123b1206d2bdbf4873b\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">restaurant.com</a> too.  Lunch specials are available everyday from 11 am to 4 pm.  They all include a fried wonton, fresh salad, steamed rice, and soup of the day.  (You can substitute fried rice or brown rice for $1 more.)    Started off with miso soup.  Interesting choice.   I went for the Yellow Curry Lunch Special with Tofu \"Thai yellow curry and Thai herbs served with Jasmine rice.\" ($6.95).   Fried tofu and potatoes were the main components of my dish.  Raw bell peppers decorated the top.  I wished they cooked the veggies with the curry though.  The fried wonton had peas and carrots in it - a bit different than what you normally find inside one of those things.  The biggest problem I had was with the rice.  It was mushy - too much water in the cooker!  It's never a good sign when the rice gets messed up!   The Husband tried out their Garlic Short Ribs Lunch Special \"Deep fried short ribs sauteed with garlic and black pepper sauce served with Jasmine rice.\" ($6.95)  It was a tasty dish and lots of flavor, but then again it's deep fried and it sounds like it would be tasty.  Overall, we found Panna Thai to be just an okay experience.  There are definitely a few other Thai restaurants in the neighborhood that has a foot up on selection, taste, and price.",

Now we know how good this place is! We were amazed from start to end with the service, quality, and easy to read menu with lots of pictures illustrations for those that never had Thai food could easily understand. I ordered the basil mint noodle combination and my wife ordered the Coconut  Thai shrimp soup which both were delicious and amazing. Our friends ordered the pumpkin curry which she said was really good and our other friend ordered the crying tiger beef which he said was no crying matter...lol  This place is a True gem and one of our new favorite places to eat at. We will definitely be coming back.",

    "text": "All you can drink Thai iced tea and Thai iced coffee?!? You can't get that kind of hookup nowadays. This is my spot!   My Thai iced coffee was strong and sweet, just the way I like my men -and- coffee. Ha. I swear they topped off my large glass about 4 times while I was there. I even left with a large cup to-go! You bet I was wired off my ass by the end of the night. No regrets!   Polite and helpful service with generous portions of flavorful Thai food - and the price is fair?! I'm seriously loving this place. Here's what we tried:  * Chicken pad Thai ($8.95) - extremely moist chicken with juicy noodles! It was super flavorful and a heaping size! 5/5  * Beef pad see ew ($8.95) - fat, phat, noodles done right! Everything was moist, seasoned well and the beef was also super tender. 5/5  * Chicken and beef satay with peanut sauce, egg fried rice and cucumber salad ($12.95) - we were able to get a mix of 3 beef & 3 chicken tender skewers. Great flavor. I also loved the peanut dipping sauce!  Get extra. So good. 5/5  * Bang bang shrimp appetizer ($8.95) - this was my least favorite dish. The curry sauce was a little lackluster, watered down and the shrimp flavor was off. My party enjoyed this appetizer, but then again they aren't as critical as I am. 3/5  * Coconut sticky rice with mango (mango sticky rice)($6.95) - a perfect end to an amazing dinner! I always feel like you need a special occasion to eat this, but man, I'll make an exception to have this every time I dine here! They make it exceptionally yummy! 5/5  I love the fact that they offer free refills on the drinks! That alone made me a strong believer. It's just a huge bonus that their food is also tasty and juicy! Panna Thai, put that on your radar. ;)",

Delivery took a bit of time but I assume that as average for southwest area. Around 30-40 minutes. But when they arrived super nice and food was nicely packed and hot.  Beef and basil was very flavorful and that was my favorite out of all three.   Pad Thai was decent, it was good but wish it had better noodles or maybe a richer sauce. But it's by no means bad at all.  Yellow curry I have had better and wish that it was less watery a bit more flavor lacked a lot of spice and the curry wasn't very thick.  Overall, I enjoyed their food and would order again. Great that they deliver!!",

They took the dish off my bill so there was no issue there.   I went back to the restaurant thinking if I don't order shrimp I would be good. Boy was I wrong, instead of rotten shrimp, they served me a young coconut that was not so young.  The coconut turned pink on the outside as well as the inside and the juice tastes bitter.  I didn't say anything as the waitress was giving dirty looks like I shouldn't have come back.  They served me rotten shrimp and had the audacity to give me dirty looks like it was my fault.

I have my favorite Thai restaurant in town (Lucki Thai) but I decided to give Panna Thai a try. Let me tell you that we were glad we did since the food and service were excellent!! We had Beef Sa-Te (Satay), Chicken Tom Kha, Thai beef salad, and sweet basil chili chicken. I like spicy so they made it extra spicy for me and the sweet basil dish was outstanding!! Rich sauce and bold flavors and best of all, they used fresh red Thai chilies! Enough to say that It was spicy enough!! The soup was great as well, one of the best we have had in town and/or out of state. Our server (Apple) was cordial, attentive, and checked on us throughout the meal. We got to try also their fried banana dessert (on the house!) and it was delicious! I would definitely make the drive again to enjoy other dishes from their menu. I highly recommend this place to anybody looking for affordable, yet high quality Thai food. Can't wait to go again!!",

    "text": "My wife and I went there for supper last night. This place is close to where we live. It was my birthday and I just finished doing a 12 hours shift. Tired and hungry, wouldn't really care less driving to other Thai restaurants in the Chinatown area. It took a while for the two of us to get seated. No one was waiting in line, but the one hostess/server was busy serving the tables and taking take out orders. Hence the wait for a table.   We ordered wings of angel which was boneless chicken wings stuffed with a combination of minced pork and clear noodle, green curry chicken, pad thai, and duck noodle soup. The stuff chicken wings were excellent with just a perfect blend of seasonings in the minced pork and rice noodle. The duck noodle was also delightful. The soup had very nice flavor to complement the duck. The spicy green curry (even though we ordered it mild) was a little bit too hot for me. The pad thai was bland. Couldn't figure out why the pad thai (a staple in all Thai restaurants) was so tasteless. It wasn't until I got the bill that I found out the waitress put the order down with special instructions that said \"no spice\". No wonder it was bland.   I would definitely come back and try some more of their other dishes like the yellow and green curry. Well worth the money, especially since we had the <a href=\"/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2Frestuarants.com&s=f3ae55869d4211e327b7034fd837ec47f6fe7ee758cda5f6bc08649e9c527d9f\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">restuarants.com</a> coupon. When we arrived there wasn't too many tables seated, but when we were about leave the restaurant was quite full. Pretty good business for a Wednesday night.  I deducted one star for the pad thai.",

I had the ahi tuna salad (good amount of tuna, good amount of dressing, good to split between 4 people if you plan on sharing all your food selections) and sa te meal with beef (perfect flavor and perfectly tender, peanut sauce was perfect, egg fried rice was tasty). Other people in my party ordered the fish cake and red chicken curry. Didn't try the fish cake but they said it was good and I wasn't too fond of the curry personally but it may be be caused I'm biased towards the homemade one my grandma makes. Anyway, this place is must try for Thai food in Vegas!",

The server was very accommodating to my bf & I who were the only vegans in the table and helped make our entrees vegan friendly - we got the Spicy Basil Fried Rice (no eggs) with steamed tofu, Pad Thai with fried tofu, a small order of Tom Kha soup with steamed tofu (big enough for the both of us to share) and all were mild spice. I also ordered a Thai iced coffee and my sister ordered a Thai tea which both have non-dairy creamer in it. We loved how it's refillable - just like their Thai BBQ locations!   The food was pretty good and tasted exactly like their counterpart restaurant but none of our dishes had the spice level we asked for. We were really looking for that spicy kick to our food but had to ask for the hot sauce spice rack to add it in ourselves. Heads up that their \"mild\" is probably considered a 1 or 2, not like your usual mild at a Thai place which is usually at a level of 3 or 4.  My family enjoyed their dishes which included the shrimp Panang penne, pork jerky, BBQ chicken with fried rice, chicken pad Thai, crab fried rice and pork BBQ ribs. The only comment they had was the crab fried rice barely had any crab in it but overall they had a good experience.   Service was good and the restaurant definitely had a fancy ambiance.",

The only reason why I give this place 4 stars instead of 5 is the inconsistency of the quality. Some days the chicken is dry and soup is over powered with fish sauce. Other than that I would definitely recommend this place.",

I like that their menu is very presentable and has many of the common Thai dishes i enjoy, that i would like to try next time. Probably pass on the curry. As for the thai tea, i saw on a \"tip\" for Panna Thai that it is unlimited thai tea and thai coffee..which sold me because no place ever does refill on thai tea. It has been a few yrs since that was posted but they may want to change that. Instead it is limited to 2 refills, still better than none!",

The server was polite and provided the lunch specials as well as the full menu.    Their menu has the classics along with some unique dishes  (ie. Salmon nuggets, Chicken curry fettuccine).  After some delay I ordered the cucumber salad as a starter and the Sweet Basil Chicken with steamed broccoli (they offer sliced or ground chicken options which is nice.  Overall assessment was that the staff was attentive, flavors of the main dish needed some work (ie. Soggy and cold egg roll, watered down sauce for the Sweet Basil Chicken - some \"sliced\" pieces were stringy and varied in size, and the veggie soup that comes with the special is mainly cabbage while still bland). Thai restaurants run rampant here in the city, so I was hoping it would compete well amongst Gata Thai, Naga Thai, Weera and even Pin Kaow. A 3-star rating is a fair grade. I'll continue to save my Thai cravings for the Henderson area.",

The staff is so friendly and accommodating - they can always recommend great veggies/proteins to substitute to make their delicious dishes vegan:) I love eating there and enjoying the lovely ambiance that is somehow both classy and casual at the same time. I also get takeout pretty frequently, and my order is always ready within 30 minutes, usually even less! The prices are beyond reasonable, and the portions usually last me a couple meals. I feel so lucky to live so close to this gem of a restaurant!",

I've had dining occasions where everything came out perfectly timed and had a flawless experience. I've also had experienced where the boyfriends entree came out before the appetizer. Then his pre dinner soup 5 min later then the appetizer 5 min later. THEN 10 min later MY entree showed up and my boyfriend was already done eating. They gave a 10% discount off the whole bill which was a nice recovery. She was also extremely apologetic which helped. Hopefully she learns from this mistake because this is a huge no no in food and bev.",

There Egg Noodle Soup is also very very good.  The duck noodle soup is good also.  The food is not super high quality but they make it work.  1 Star Because the service is very good and nice.  They know every person that comes in by first name and provide a friendly atmosphere  1 Star Because the Thai Tea is very good.  Any that restaurant for me should have excellent Thai Tea.  The portion is a bit small but standard.  1 Star Because the parking is easy and the spot is big enough to fit everyone and you are seated immediately.  -1 Star due to the food taking a very long time.  A lunch is 1 hour standard for most people.  I work across the street and cannot get my food in time.  It takes at least 40 min for the food to come out and i made it back late to work.  every time.  I even left early to go eat at panna thai and i was still late.  One time, every single person in the restaurant did not have food.  Total: 3 Stars = Eat on weekends and nighttime if you are local.  Not a place to drive far to eat or if you are rushed on time.",

We ordered most of our food medium or a #8 and it was really hot.  I drank more water and ate less food.   Atmosphere: It's a typical table and booth dinning, nothing special.

The chicken was good though.  Pad Thai was delicious, but for an extra $1 for shrimp there should be more Han just four of them in the dish... That's kind of a rip off. The pad Thai was tasty though!  Crab Rangoons were great, full of filling and there were a lot of them...  I'll order again from here but I'll skip the yellow curry, and skip ordering shrimp",

Our waitress was apple she showed great hospitality and really made us feel welcome. Great part about it was that she used to work at arawan one of our favorite places before so we remembered each other. Ok so onto the food. Me and the wife started off our appetizers with the divine scallops man was it good!! Very well harmonized taste. It was a little spicy with an herbal Thai kind of taste to it. But wow we really enjoyed ourselves!! We also had the steamed dumplings mmm it was delicious. I thought it would have just been a basic dumpling taste but boy was I wrong it had so many delicious taste to it. So onto our entrees my wife got the seafood eggplant. The seafood eggplant was such a well portioned delicious meal. Came with eggplant, shrimp, fish, squid, muscles, bell peppers, & onions. I got the bbq spare ribs. Bbq spare ribs was fall off the bone good! Literally the meat was so tender!! Overall my experience has made me very happy with our dinner tonight. So please come here it's great and such a chill place to eat at!!",

My recent order included Panang Curry, Steamed Dumplings, and Tasty Ginger (with shrimp).  The curry was delicious. I ordered a mild but it came with a kick. Not sure if they got it wrong, or my tolerance is very low. It was creamy and very coconutty. The chicken was also nice and tender. I didn't really care for the dumplings. They were good, but they had an off taste that I couldn't quite figure out. The dipping sauce that came with the dumplings was a bit too strong in flavor. The tasty ginger with shrimp was my favorite. It had just the right amount of ginger and spices and the shrimp (peeled) was perfectly cooked. Their Thai tea is also very good (pretty generous with the cream, which I like).  If you're ordering through Yelp Eat24, the entrees come with rice. The menu doesn't state that. I wish I knew beforehand because I ordered 2 servings of rice and it came with 4.",

For my entree, I had the yellow curry with Scallops. I was actually pretty amazing by the quality of Scallops. They were not the small ones, they were the bigger - good quality ones. It was a bit spicy but it was perfect and complimented the side of rice that came with our order. I also tried their skewers and they were also really good. The place is really clean and modern unlike a lot of Thai places that I've been to. I honestly thought that this was just going to be \"another Thai restaurant\" but it definitely went beyond my expectations. Try this if you're craving for good and authentic Thai food.",

The place has a nice interior and were greeted immediately and seated.  No one explained the menu, but we asked many questions.  We ordered the lunch special of Pad Thai, salad, soup and egg rolls.  Items came out rather quickly.  The soup first and it was probably the most tasty thing we had.  The main orders came next and they had forgotten my egg roll, but they showed up with them in just a minute or so after advising them.  They stuck an extra in there for the mistake.  The egg rolls were fairly tasty.  Our main entrees however were basically bland, no spice, no taste at all.  I could tell I was chewing something, but you really could not tell what. My wife also agreed that it was tasteless.",

They charge a lot for delivery and for extra additions to their rather bare dishes. They were extremely rude to my wife on the phone with our last order and hung up on her after getting our order wrong.   A few times I've gone in to pick up orders with a massive queue of other disgruntled take out customers waiting for their food for over 45 minutes. And they expect you to say sorry for being upset with them! I rarely ever leave negative reviews but this is a classic example of the mixed bag of service you get in the city which should take customer service more seriously since it's the only industry keeping the city afloat.",

From my pictures it looks like the portions are small but those two were enough to really fill me up (and I eat a lot). For the papaya salad, I got to choose a spicy level from 1-10 and I got a 6 and it was actually pretty spicy which I appreciate, but my favorite was my pad see ew. The beef was so tender and it was actually thick slices of beef which makes it so much more better. The noodles were not dry, they were perfectly soft. They also have a lunch deal as well so if you just want something small for a good price, ask about it!",

So delivery was completely disappointing. we ordered pad see ew, massaman and fried rice - all level 8. They must have completely ignored that request as everything was zero spice. The three entrees we ordered came with a tiny serving of rice too... normally you get rice per entree. The massaman curry was the most pathetic thing I have ever seen - maybe three pieces of chicken and one potato chunk. All of the to go items were in different packaging and unorganized. So disappointed for the price definitely not worth it !!!",

It's simple to call & order pick-up, which would be ready in 15 min. However, I suggest to never order Thai Tea if it's pick-up. It's great when you dine-in & you can get unlimited refills, but as for pick-up, it's never as good. I'm going to assume that they make the Thai Tea when you call, which in time, will sit & be watered down by the time you pick-up. I also suggest to pass on adding boba. I never find it fresh.  Other than that, their food is good & their portion sizes are good. I have always liked all the food I tried. My go-to is the Spicy Crab Noodle, which is made with legit crab & large enough to share with another person. Panna Thai is a good option to eat at with a family & share different items on the menu. You can end your meal with a Mango Sticky Rice for dessert!",

She tried to convince me that the egg needed to be in the plate even after I explained for the second time, I have an allergy to egg. Even after correcting my order, I waited  20 minutes after I was done eating for  the check  to arrive to my table.  Not once did they come by to pick up my plates so I just put it in the table next to me. Jump is the name of another employee there and honestly he was very professional and apologized then tried to encourage  me to come back. Unfortunately, first time impressions last forever and I will never come back.   Becomes of the nice guy named Jump I  gave a two star instead of one.",

On to the food!  Basil Noodle ($8.50): \"Pad Kee Mao\", Pork, Stir Fried Thick Rice Noodles, Chili Basil, Scrambled Egg, Bell Pepper and Onion. This was not bad...not very hot though for a 10/10. I also found the pork to be a little thick and tougher than I am used to at other Thai restaurants.  THIS is one the dishes I compare all other Thai restaurants in town...and this one wasn't very noteworthy :(  Chili Basil ($6.95): \"Pad Ka Pao\" in Lunch Portion, Ground up Chicken, Sauteed with Sweet Basil, Onion, Bell Pepper, Fresh Chili, and Jasmine Rice. This was a great version of the staple! The most spicy out of all the dishes...it was still far from a 10/10 though!  It was good though, and better than most out there!  Panang Curry in Lunch Portion : Coconut Milk, Curry Paste, Thai Herbs, and Jasmine Rice. This was a great version as well, with just the right amount of spices, flavor and heat! I love Panang curry...and they have a great one here!  Again, better than most I've had out here!  Pad Thai in Lunch Portion : Chicken, Stir Fried Rice Noodles, Scrambled Egg, Shallot, Bean Sprouts, and Tamarind Sauce. This was Grandpa's order...it was good! A bit sweet, but good overall!  I'd say it would be on par with the others I've tried.  Thai Iced Tea ($3)...unlimited refills! It was a good rendition as well, but you can't beat free refills...yeeeee!  Great choice for Thai food if you are in the area!  Pics :",

The food came out on time with no delayed, presentation is really nice and taste good on all dishes. The service is also excellent, very friendly and attentive. I would recommend to reserved your table 2-3 weeks in advance for the party as they can get really busy. The item that I would recommend is Sa-tay, pad thai, pepper steak, spicy green curry, and the BBQ. I will go to Panna Thai every time I think of Thai food.",

I normally do pick up and they are pretty quick (ready in about 10-15 minutes)  The chicken pad Thai ($8.50) is pretty bland flavor wise but the spice level is pretty spot on (I typically order a 4 or 5 spice level). I have also tried the yellow chicken curry ($8.95) which is just OK. All of the items range from about $5-$18 apps to chef specialities and the portion size is pretty good especially for the price point.  I'm not in any big rush to come back but overall food was decent at a good price.",

This place does it well. Very much comparable to our favourite Thai place which is just a little further from home - Archi's on Rainbow.  The first time we came, I ordered the lunch special - both of us agreed that the soup that came with it was so tasty! I had the Pad Thai and he had the tofu Panang Curry. Both delicious!!

I had the bbq chicken and it was juicy. My wife had the sate skewers. Both of us enjoyed the meals. We had the spring rolls and the beef Thai salad. That salad I can eat all day long. It was very flavorful and I wanted another one but didn't want to be a pig. Everyone should try that salad. It is a salad I can have every day and wouldn't tire of it. Overall a very good place to have dinner at. Also try the fried banana with coconut. That was a real treat. Thank you for the wait staff that gave the fried banana coconut dessert it was wonderful. They were friendly from the start and your drinks were always refilled quick. Thank you again for a pleasant atmosphere",

Joe was our server and he take his times to explain the food on the menu. He even give us a complimentary larb for father's day special which is excellent. Larb chicken was served on a lettuce wedge and it taste like chicken salad with lime vinaigrette dressing wrap with lettuce. We start our course with Steamed dumpling,  Scallop tamarind and Golden cup. We love all the appetizers that we ordered,  and their Steamed dumpling is totally caught me by surprise.  A lot of Thai and Chinese restaurant that I'd been to usually use the dumpling that are available in most of the Asian supermarket but Panna dumpling is different, they made their own dumpling fresh from start. The Scallop tamarind is excellent, the scallop is huge and fresh with sweet tamarind sauce,  a perfect combination. We had Beef satay dinner,  Crispy duck,  and Seafood eggplants for our main dish and everything are excellent. They serve their Seafood eggplants on the hot sizzling plate and it can be very very hot, please watch out for the sizzling plate for parents with young children. Joe said customer can request the servers to serve it on regular plate. Up to this point we are so stuff with all the foods that we order but we really want to try their Mango sticky rice.  We order that for takeout since we're so full but I will definitely go back for more. The server said they will have new menu coming out in the next few months. Last but not least,  the price is very decent and all the customer looks like they had a food coma after they finished their food.  Save some space and try their dessert,  fried bananas with icecream and young coconut with icecream and sticky is already on my wish list!!!!!",

    "text": "I absolutely love this restaurant and I'm always treated wonderfully here. I've been going for several years now and it's definitely my favorite Thai restaurant. One of my favorite things is that you can get the lunch specials with fried rice because most Thai restaurants in Las Vegas will only give you white rice, when you order for just one person.   I love the dishes and some of my favorites are the pad see ew, bbq spare ribs, salmon, beef and chicken skewers. I also highly recommend you try substituting Chinese broccoli instead of regular broccoli on many of the dishes and soups.  Last but not least, the waitresses are so beautiful and friendly.",

Sure, it's just a couple of minutes down the road, but you know how it is when you get lazy.  Our few experiences at the restaurant have been pleasant. We've never had to wait for seating. The service is always prompt. We've had the same waitress during each visit and she always has a smile on her face.  We've come to like their Chicken Pad See-Ew with Chinese broccoli and their Beef Satay dinner. It's more than enough for the two of us. The satay is always tender and well seasoned and the fried rice that accompanies it is quite flavorful. The Pad See-Ew, though it is one of our favorites, can be off sometimes. Most of the time it's spot on (the chicken is tender and the noodles are al dente), but there have been a couple of occasions where it has been bland or too peppery. But again, it's not all the time and that's why we continue to get it.   We have, also, tried their Garlic Short Ribs, Wings of Angel, Shrimp Panang Curry, Pad Thai, and Tom Yum Soup. Everything has been good, so far, so we'll continue to enjoy our friendly neighborhood Thai restaurant.",

The next time I'm sick, I'm going to call in an order just for the soup.  The chili basil chicken with brown rice is my go-to menu item for lunch.  I like that brown rice is an option.

Restaurant was clean and spacious. I'm used to the \"hole in the wall\" settings. This one has a nice laid back interior.   We ordered shrimp pad thai, sweet chili basil with chicken, and crab fried rice. Portion of pad thai was a bit small but the size of shrimp was rather big. Spicy chili basil with chicken was good, but didn't taste anything out of the ordinary.  Same with crab fried rice.  This order was huge.  The latter 2 orders we took home to go since both portions were more than enough for 2 people.  I would come back to this place if I were in the area, but I think I still prefer my usual go-to Thai place Noodle House.",

Good flavor, spice & lots of shrimp.  Cucumber salad... I HATE cucumbers for some reason but I tried this. It was amazing. So cool and refreshing with a lil onion in it and the dressing was nice. The cucumbers were actually great! I got basic chow mien with chicken... The noodles and veggies were good but the chicken was not. I should have gotten veggies only!  My bf got sweety duck. The sauce was good and it came with lots of broccoli. The sauce was yummy on the broccoli but the duck was very dry and pretty gross. :o(  Other than the meat everything was amazing!

The service is good and we never have to wait long. The ambiance is also very modern and pleasant. So why only 2 stars? Unfortunately, last time that we ate here, my girlfriend paid for the bill with her credit card and left a generous cash tip. The staff then decided to take an additional tip from her credit card. This is straight-up theft. Unauthorized charges on an individual's credit card is a crime. Furthermore, it shows that the staff is not communicating. We still may go back for the food, but we will definitely be paying our entire bill in cash.",

    "text": "I've been going to Panna Thai since it first opened and it's still my favorite Thai restaurant in the valley. I used to always eat at their first restaurant (Thai BBQ on Jones) when I was in high school and when they opened Panna my family would come here almost every other week for dinner since it was closer to home. I love their Thai Tea and I've yet to find any place that beats theirs. It's pretty sweet, but very refreshing and creamy. Their service is always great and their takeout business seems very lively.   Now for the food, I'll throw out a lot of recommendations but keep in mind I always eat in so I'm not sure how well things keep for delivery or takeout. For noodles, their Pad See-ew and Pad Thai are consistently delicious. I typically go for Beef Pad See-ew or Chicken Pad Thai. For curries, I almost always get a Beef Panang Curry because it's probably my favorite thing on the menu. You can adjust the spiciness to whatever you want too. If Panang isn't your style, I'd recommend the Green Curry with chicken. Other amazing things include: Herbal Fish Salad, which is a bunch of strips of crispy white fish with a unique vinaigrette on greens. Tom Kha soup with chicken, which is like a sour soup with coconut milk and mushrooms.   They have affordable lunch specials here too. I usually go for the Beef Sate (~$8) or the Garlic Short Ribs (~$7). The short ribs are packed with a lot of flavor in a garlic sauce and the beef sate is like three skewers of meat with good egg fried rice.  All in all, I've been to Panna a bunch of times and have never had a bad experience. They're very consistent and they make good Thai food as well as some specialty fusion dishes. It's a great place to go for large groups too. They serve beer and wine and have a TV if there's a certain game you need to watch. But seriously, get the Thai Tea.",

They offered me a free pad see ew and said they would notate a record in their system. I called today to place an order for takeout, And asked if they Honor the free Pad See Ew. I spoke to one lady she seemed puzzled and asked to speak to someone else. Then, I spoke to a gentleman that also seemed puzzled, but he did check whatever he checked and said there was no record on file.    I am the type of person that lives by his word and since they could not live up to their's, I will no longer support any of their locations as I am about honor and they have proved they are not.",

    "text": "We were celebrating our anniversary on New Years night and thought this restaurant was the perfect spot. I was wrong.   We entered the restaurant with no issue as we were seated right away. And that's when everything went wrong. The waitress took a long while to get our order,  and when we were ready, my girlfriend asked if we can have all our orders delivered at the same time. This is because her main dish was tom kha kai which tends to come in first because they're served as an appetizer. She also ordered pineapple fried rice with that because that's how she enjoys the soup. Back to the order, when she asked the waitress if all our food be delivered at the same time, the rep retorted a not-so-reassuring, \"Uhm... I hope so.\" She chuckled and walked away. Experiencing was displeasing as if they weren't even going to try and make it happen.  We waited a while for our food to come in, and guess what? They all came in separately. First, it was the chicken satay which we ate pretty quickly. Then we got the soup and my noodle entree. My girlfriend tried waiting for the fried rice when she realized that her soup was getting cold. Very displeasing to see her not eat with me. At that point, she started eating the soup and thinking twice about the other order that was still late. So she went up to another server to tell them that she didn't want that order anymore.   The food was very basic. Nothing about it stood in mind. My noodles lacked a little bit of sauce as it appeared dry. The satay was rubbery and the peanut sauce that went along with it was bland. My girlfriend liked her soup but was not impressed about the mushroom used with it. Still, it hit the spot.   Overall, would we come back for a second round? No. The restaurant was courteous enough to give us a 10% off discount for the trouble, which was surprising because it didn't really seem like they cared from the beginning. Anyway, we're too paranoid for repeated offender so I think we'll pass this restaurant and go somewhere else.",

The  choices are typical but the presentation for the food was fancy.  The food came out one at a time (15 minutes wait) but it was still salty!! I  did like the appetizer.  We ordered all seafood dishes except for the bbq chicken.  We also ordered coconut  ice cream for dessert.  The waitress said  it was for one person but it's huge! Also,  if you are planning to come here after the gym make sure it's not ARM DAY!  They must have the heaviest teapots.  It weighed as much as a baby elephant!

It's a cold pad Thai with just the right amount of flavor and the slices of jalapenos in it give it an extra kick. I also highly recommend their panang curry; it's delicious! Always get mine with fried tofu because I'm a vegetarian but you do you, booboo! My friend had the duck this time around and loved it. Extra tip: Thai tea has free refills. Score!",

The fella orders the crispy duck which is heavenly! Very well seasoned, perfect crisp, delicious hoisin sauce and overall truly unforgettable.   I order the crying tiger and OH MY I cry tears of joy every time!! The meat is so tender and flavorful with a sauce that though is quite delightful is not truly needed. However, I do at times use the sauce for my veggies!  It's a great dinner for when you want something delivered that won't ever disappoint!",

Enough for us 2 to be full on dinner and probably 3 lunches worth left over. We enjoyed free refills on the Thai Ice tea too; I mean where else do you get that? All for about $42. So dinner and 3 lunches for 42 bucks. Super Yummy, lots of flavor, big portions, cheery staff and very reasonable prices, what more can you ask? Get down there!",

It used to be so good I would frequently drive 30+ minutes just to get it. The beef Pad Thai used to be the absolute best in the city--tender beef, perfectly cooked noodles and full of flavor. For about the last year I have been getting anything but that. I kept coming back thinking that the flavor and dish that I loved so much would be revived. Well, after receiving these extremely dry, bland noodles and beef today I will never come back here. Please don't waste your time and money eating here. Find some place other than Panna if you are craving really delicious Pad Thai because I'm sure you will be as disappointed as I have been over this last year.",

Of the choices around, I give this place top marks.  Even before I look at the menu, Panna merits high marks for a great dining room and customer service.  The food is always good and they put a little extra into presentation.  Not that I care much about that at Thai restaurants if the food is good, but it's a nice change.    This is a good spot for a business lunch, or if you fancy Thai on a social outing but are looking for a little bit more upscale setting.",

This restaurant is very clean and the decor looks brand new. Our waitress was new, a trainee, but she was very pleasant, conscientious, and a lead server or manager was basically over her shoulder the entire time making sure she was on point. Excellent service.  We ordered: -Riesling -Cucumber salad -Summer rolls (non fried) -Chicken pad thai -Masaman curry  The cucumber salad was my favorite of everything, and all of it was delicious. The vegetables were so fresh and the dressing was very light (rice wine vinegar and something else I can't quite put my finger on). I was in crunchy, cucumber heaven.  I will definitely be back to Panna Thai!",

I am a huge fan of all of their appetizers, but their entrees make this place shine. I have tried many Thai restaurants in town, but this one still beats them all by food quality and price.  I love their pad see ew, it's hard for me to stray from that, but all of the other dishes I have tried are amazing as well. Ranging from their beef/chicken satey, crab noodle, fried rices, and soups, I can't find a single negative thing to say.  Definitely recommend if you're in the neighborhood, and if you're not, make the drive and see for yourself. Also need to mention, their prices are unbeatable.  Most plates are all under $10, you can't find that quality of food at that price anywhere in town!",

No one at the host stand.   I looked at the menu (which i grabbed myself) and when ready to place order,  was waiting forever for one of the staff to take my order.  No one came over.   I finally just walked out and drove over to nearby Thai restaurant.    I've dined in a few times as well and the service is just as bad then too.  I hope they see this review and make some changes.

We began with yum-wood-sen, glass noodles with ground meat and shrimp with Thai spice and lime juice on lettuce.  For entrees we shared orders of scallop tamarind and spicy eggplant.  All three dishes made our taste buds jump for joy.  Our bill came in a few cents short of the minimum purchase requirement so I had to order a soda for takeout.",

We asked if this was complimentary but they informed us that they usually only do it for regular customers like us. Talk about getting on their good side!  Overall this was a great place to go for both food and service, the restaurant itself was very clean and tidy and even had a flat screen tv so we could watch the NBA finals. How did we end the night? Fried coconut covered bananas. YUM :D",

Here is why: I don't think it's anything great, but it's not too bad either. Although yesterday my husband refused to finish any of the dishes and my 3 year old is literally throwing up as I write this. Last night he had fried rice and soup (she hadn't eaten anything else for dinner - very slim chance of a coincidence).  All four times I've been there, it takes 40 minutes to an hour + to get done. And we are usually \"fast\" eaters. We sit down, we know what we want, we eat, and we're out. We go out every day and don't have time to sit around and talk like some people do.  Ok, I can understand that also, but when it takes 10 minutes between asking for a check and actually getting one there is something wrong here. My husband had already left by then as my 3 year old had enough of sitting there that long. Good thing I paid with cash or I wouldn't be able to wait for another 10 minutes for them to run a card.  As much as I want to like it, I can't, and I won't be going back.",

We order it with lots of heat and they do sometimes under-deliver but I'd rather have it not spicy enough the way too spicy.

The staff is VERY friendly and you get served rather quickly. They even deliver if you do not feel like going out.. This is our favorite place after soccer practice. I highly encourage you to give em a try",

Price is reasonable compared to the portion and the quality of food. Most importantly the taste is very good and considered authentic. I love the Beef sa-te, Spicy Crab noodle, fried banana. We definitely will go back and try more dishes. Sooooo yummy!!!",

When I walked in, the atmosphere was pleasant and quiet and the server was friendly.  I ordered the egg rolls, the tom yum goong, the pad see ew, and the red curry.  Everything was really tasty.  While it wasn't THE best Thai food I've ever had, it was easily one of the best places I've been to outside of China Town (though this place is sort of on the cusp).  My only (minor) complaint is that they didn't have the type of egg rolls I liked.  Definitely worth visiting if you're in the area.",

The lighting was dining room  perfect, the colors and decor were chic and welcoming, no typical greasy smell associated with asian restaurants.  The food was very impressive too.  good quality and fresh seafood and veggies and flavorful ingredience...and very appetizing but not too over the top presentation. We ordered the saute shrimp and egglant dish that came on a sizzling plate.  all veggies and seafoods cooked to perfection.  the basil & garlic dish with pork was excellent.  Kids got Chicken Satay, Angel wings, steamed dumpling, Pad Thai and  Pad na...all were good.  Maybe only the steamed dumplings lost a little steam.  Service was impeccable.  We are bringing our employees back to the restaurant again...tonight!",

Also, exceeded my expectations for a Thai place.  We had San Miguel.  Dark and tasty.  No cold glasses though. Boo.  Started with two apps: Wings of angel and royal duck.  The names are a bit whimsical.  The wings are stuffed with glass noodles, and ground pork then fried ultra light and crispy. Very good!  The royal duck was a really pretty presentation.  It was rolled in a tortilla/crepe thing and served with a way to sweet BBQish sauce.  We just thought it needed salt and spice.  Also, the duck was tough.   Ordered two entrees: Choo-chee shrimp and Pad see-ew noodles with beef.  The shrimp were in a flavorful spicy red curry sauce with keffir leaves, served with rice.  They were good.  The noodles were chow- fun esque.  We ordered a 6 for the spice and they were HOT! We were sweatin' but it hurts so good!  The portions were generous and the prices fair.  We had 3 beers, 2 apps, and 2 entrees....bill was $55.  A lovely dinner. We will go again for sure.",

Feels like you almost get a full chicken breast with every piece and the peanut sauce is good!  Crab Wonton $5.95 - Not something I always order when out eating thai but I did here and they were cooked perfectly. I know they are fairly easy to make but I think everyone's had some pretty horribly cooked (burned, no filling, ect.. I know you're thinking of those bad one's right now) CW's and these are not the case here.  Pad Thai $8.50 - 5 spice & tastes like 5 spice. Comes with sprouts, carrot shreds, lime & peanuts on the side for flavoring as desired.  All three of these are plenty of food for two people (this evening it was me -starving & my preggo buddy & there were leftovers!).  The restaurant itself is beautiful. Large in size compared to most others & with a modern decor. I'd say pretty good choice if you're looking to impress someone & not break the bank here. Not to mention service is awesome.  Overall my favorite Thai place right now with service, price & food added up makes it well worthy of 5 stars.",

Mushrooms and bean sprouts and fried egg and red peppers. I really enjoyed this. The portion size is tremendous. 4 people could have eaten this plate. My friend got the spicy tofu with pork. I was a bad girl and tried a carrot to see the flavor (she ordered a 10 on spice and I was worried), but it was real tasty too. Hers should have been hotter temperature wise. My came out steaming hot. We shared a cucumber salad and that was delicious. Chopped red onions and red peppers on top of cucumbers in a sugary dressing. YUM! Definitely coming back here. Service was eh. Nothing great, nothing horrible, but I do like a friendly waitress. Always rounds out the meal. But great food, huge portions make me a very very happy girl!",

The waitress was very attentive and outgoing. She tried to spark a conversation as well as made sure our drinks were always full. I was very pleased with the service of this staff.   I ordered the Pad Thai with chicken and was craving rice but did not want to order another entree since I wouldn't be able to finish it. A convenient feature they have on their menu is that you can order a single serving of rice which was what I was craving for! I ordered the egg fried rice single serving. My boyfriend ordered the pepper steak. We both ordered the crab rangoon for a appetizer.  The appetizer came out very shortly after we ordered and tasted very fresh. There wasn't a lot of stuffing in the crab rangoons, which didn't bother us since we ordered so much food. The only thing I thought was weird was they didn't ask for the spice level I wanted for my Pad Thai which came out not spicy at all. I would compare it to a 0 spice level from 1-10 scale. I prefer mine to have some spice but it didn't bother me because I could make it as spicy as I wanted.  The pepper steak came out with a generous amount of steak. We couldn't finish everything! We had plenty of left overs to take home!  They took our dirty plates as well as replace each dirty plate with a clean plate after each entree. I loved that they took that into detail in their customer service/server training because I feel, it makes me feel more catered to. The service made my first time experience here fantastic and I will be back again. I would highly recommend this place!",

Then Egg Roll has a hair in it & called them just to be put on hold and hung up on! SAVE YOUR MONEY AND TIME STAY AWAY",

The spiciness is good and it's just bomb. Food comes out hot and fresh. We also get Thai coffee and tea. TIP: they have unlimited refills for Thai tea and coffee if you dine in  Service- Great and very personable. They get a lot of to go orders so just be patient with them. They are attentive. There's always just about 2-3 people on the floor so between them, phone orders and dine in it gets a bit backed up but it's a good sign since you know how much people likes their food.  Definitely always going to come back! Best Thai food in town. Highly recommended!",

The staff here are always friendly and welcoming. It is very clean in here which is a +++. Their Thai tea here is freaking bomb. Not too sweet, not too bitter and watered down. I also love that this place is literally down the street from my house.  I definitely recommend their satay (chicken/beef), fried rice, duck rolls, summer rolls, pad thai, tom kha gai soup, sticky rice &mango and their egg rolls! The staff here know me by name because they deliver to my house so much LOL. Sorry guys! ;)  The food here is freaking phenomenal. Who doesn't like amazing quality, reasonably priced thai food?! It is always made in a timely manner and great presentation. I've never gotten a bad dish here which is a surprise.   Thanks Panna thai for taking all of my money, but keeping my tummy happy! 5/5 and customer for liiiife!",

I saw a review that said they had free refills on thai iced tea which I had never heard of at any other resteraunt... hahaha  Service was good although we had a girl that was still new I guess... she was a little hesitant but she held through very well. I'm sure she just needed a little more training on little nit pick information. We were greeted right away & seated in a half booth table. The decor was clean & not so cluttered with high ceilings which gave the place a very spacious feel.   The food was overall delicious & they have the pickled Serrano chili peppers which is always a plus for me when it comes to thai places =]  THAI ICED TEA $3 - FREE REFILLS!!!! when you dine in that is... i would have to say it is a little bit sweeter than what i am used too... but that may be because its free refills. ahahha you can seriously only take down 2 glasses worth otherwise expect a tummy ache!  PEPPER STEAK LUNCH $6.95 - I was definitely expecting cubed steak pieces but they were more thin slices... but the flavor was still good. Served w/ rice,  small salad, & an egg roll.  ROYAL DUCK $7.95 - this was actually very DERICIOUS. Its duck w/ cream cheese & veggies wrapped in a soft tortilla.   SATE BEEF or CHICKEN $7.95 - on the lunch menu... we got both for extra charge. Served w/ cucumber salad, egg fried rice, & DERICIOUS peanut sauce which i also used to eat my pad thai as well!!  DUMPLING APPETIZER $6.95 - steamed dumplings in the shape of a bag so it's definitely cute I would say. Served w/ soy sauce & 5 pieces.  DUCK NOODLE SOUP $9.95 - hubby got this & he got it w/ egg noodles... I never seen him eat hot soup so FAST   SHRIMP PAD THAI $9.95 - when I ask for spicy... I get it! Noodles are perfect & the peanuts come on the side of the dish. Even though it is spicy you can still taste the flavors.   MANGO W/ STICKY RICE $6.95 - ummm this dessert is like a piece of ARTWORK!! Seriously it is so pretty that you don't want to eat it! The rice was also a PERFECT consistency of STICKY & chewy.",

I think it is safe to say that Panna Thai has been put on my list as one of my favorite Thai restaurants that I have discovered. Options are great and I like to eat really spicy foods and to be able to adjust the levels is great, in which you can ask for no spicy to really spicy.   The restaurant has dim lighting, yet very classic and elegant. It looks clean, organized, and the noise level is more on the quiet to the moderate side for the most part. The employees there are very nice as well! A big bonus, in my personal opinion, is the refillable thai tea!    A few of my favorite things to order:  - Appetizer: Sa-te chicken/beef with their sauce on the side  - Spicy fish cha cha - Pad see ew  - Pad thai (I prefer the pad see ew more, depending)  - Papaya salad - Their curry is quite good (red, green, panang, or yellow)      Unfortunately, I don't recall which one I ordered but might be one of      those!  - Dessert: Mango sticky rice",

An hour before closing, we were the only ones there. (Two women showed up a bit later.) They were already doing some cleaning up, which may account for the very bright lights that weren't in evidence on previous visits.  Surprisingly, there were two Rieslings available by the glass. Our adorable server, Fon, couldn't tell me how the domestic or German offerings differed in terms of dryness, so she offered to bring a sample. She returned with a tray of four tiny sake cups, for both of us to taste the two wines. My husband was a little embarrassed, because he wasn't planning on drinking anything, but the wines were already poured. Very elegant presentation!  We ordered the grilled veggies as an appetizer. The zucchini and eggplant were wrapped with a wide slice of red pepper and topped with a drizzle of lime-infused oil. Delicious.  For our main courses, we chose Massaman Lamb Curry and Mango Tango Salmon. I made sure to say that I wanted the salmon cooked medium. Though her English was very limited, Fon repeated our order verbatim. While the curry was very good (though not the best ever), with lean lamb, as we requested, the salmon dish was a huge disappointment. It looked beautiful, with lots of basil, cashews, some mango, and a few flecks of red pepper. But not only was the salmon a tiny portion, it was thin, with one end not more than a millimeter in thickness. You can't possibly cook it medium when it's that thin. It was so dry and overcooked that we had no choice but to send it back. In its place, we ordered the Thai Pepper Steak.   While we waited for our replacement, Fon brought us a couple of complimentary cream cheese wontons. It's something that I would never order, since I try to avoid fried foods, but they were fabulous, and it was a really classy thing to do.  The beef dish was very good, with nicely tenderized beef, though not as exotic or spicy as I would have liked. While it was well-executed, it's probably my fault for not choosing something more adventurous.  Overall, we enjoyed our dinner at Panna Thai - with kudos to our server for making things right!",

However, this evening we ordered Panna Thai through Uber Eats and I was highly satisfied with the appetizing Thai fare that was delivered to our home. We had a fried rice night ordering crab, pineapple, and chicken fried rice along with pork dumplings. I am a huge fan of crab fried rice and it was delicious and fresh. The dumplings were delectable as well. All in all we were pleased with our choice to order through Uber Eats from here. Maybe in the near future we will dine in the restaurant to see if service has improved.",

Also, take another solid 10-15 mins to ask for check and pay. I am already annoyed by the slow service in a empty restaurant. Worst of worst was, next day, both my partner and I had a diarrhea, I tossed the left over food and won't go back to this place again as there are so many other choices around the city",

There was a lovely freshness about it and a surprising portion of salmon fillet! I could not nearly finish the meal. The next day I enjoyed a Grilled Shrimp Salad with a house vinegarette, which did not disappoint. Though it, of course, was not fresh, it too was made with real, wholesome ingredients. My only critique is, there was an overabundance of Iceberg Lettuce... Which, in my opinion, took away from the meal, the element of fine, Thai dining... as I consider ( over)use of Iceberg Lettuce to be fodder! For the price, the salad was a disappointment, the Salmon entire exceeded my expectations.",

My recent order pad see ew, asparagus with beef, and bbq ribs.  The Pad see ew uses large egg noodles. Very soft. More sou sauce based unlike the pad thai. But very delicious. They offer choices between regular broccoli or the chinese broccoli for the dish.   Asparagus and beef stir fry. It was seasoned perfectly. Not too salty, asparagus had a crisp to each bite and not overly cooked.   Bbq ribs. Gives you 3 large ribs marinated with a soy sauce asian bbq sauce. It was great as well. It came with a sweet and sour dipping sauce and fried rice with it as well. The meat was very tender, and came right off the bones. It's a musy try!   Overall, a great thai restaurant. You can never go wrong here!",

I don't think I've ever been more disappointed in other reviews as I was that night.   Entering, this place was empty...like uncomfortable empty. There was another couple with a child, and even though the atmosphere was great (the ambiance earned them the two stars!) it was just too empty for 9pm at night.   We order several dishes including papaya salad, pad see eu, pineapple curry, masaman curry, and pineapple rice (which was actually never brought out to us, but after tasting some of the other stuff, we were pretty ecstatic that we wouldn't have to waste more of our money). We also ordered thai tea (one with boba) - which was decent and we weren't charged for refills (which is a plus compared to other places). However, the boba was rock hard -- this might be because it was late at night and they just wanted to get rid of leftovers, but that's not OK at all.   Out of all the dishes, I ONLY enjoyed the papaya salad and the pad see eu. I felt as if the pineapple curry and the masaman curry were the EXACT same - the only difference was that the pineapple curry had pineapple. The curry was also too watered down.   All in all, the atmosphere is what's given them my two stars. Service was also on par, no one was rude.   However, I noticed that a tip was added on to my initial check. So beware of that.   I'll be trying out plenty of other thai places before I give this place a second chance.",

    "text": "Satay is something rather ubiquitous in my home country of Australia. Being situated close to South East Asia we have quality Asian restaurants in the same way the South Western United States enjoys incredible Mexican food. Satay dishes are so commonplace that in Australia they appear on the menu at regular Chinese restaurants.  Living in Vegas now I've missed satay and even though Malaysian satay (my preference) can be hard to find, Thai satay is an acceptable alternative. Panna Thai takes that alternative and makes it in the best possible way.  Every time we go here I order the Satay Chicken as a dinner portion and both sauce and chicken are incredible. It comes served with egg fried rice and the standard little cucumber salad and is delicious from first bite to last. The chicken is exquisitely basted and marinaded and the peanut sauce perfection itself.  When my wife and I go here we usually enjoy the vegetable summer rolls as a pleasant, fresh appetizer to share and she raves about her vegetarian pad thai with fried tofu.   I've also ordered the BBQ pork noodle soup which is similarly tasty, but overkill when you're ordering a big plate of Satay.  Service is always attentive and friendly.  My only real gripe with Panna Thai is their lack of a fountain drinks machine and the requirement to buy cans of Coke (or whatever) if you want something non-alcoholic other than filtered tap water. This, of course, means no soda refills.  Overall though, Panna Thai is a great option. Their menu might not be as extensive as some, but they have more than enough to satisfy everyone.",

    "text": "I got a certificate off of <a href=\"/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2Frestaurant.com&s=c5fe485af4df376130bee54f875814d79c4d7913e1258123b1206d2bdbf4873b\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">restaurant.com</a> for this place, so I decided to use it last night with my boyfriend and my brother.  We were greeted and seated when we came in. I handed the man the certificate and he looked at it and said okay. We got our water and looked over the menus.  We ordered chicken panang curry, bbq spare ribs, beef pad see ew, and beef pad Thai. Each dish was a medium in spicyness.   When we ordered, my boyfriend asked the waitress if it all comes with rice and she said that the ribs and curry did, so he asked her if it was enough for all of us or if we should order more rice. She said that we don't need more rice because we have the pad thai and the pad see ew and that's what you eat with the dishes. EXCUSE ME!? Who are you to tell us what we eat with our dishes? We're Filipino, we eat EVERYTHING with rice, even noodles! So of course we were a little embarrassed to even order anymore rice.   The food came after about 10 minutes. My favorite dish was the panang, sooo good! The ribs were really good also, so soft and soo flavorful. The pad see ew and pad thai were average.  The reason why I'm giving them 3 stars instead of 4 is because of their service. No one EVER smiled, asked us how we were doing, or initiated any type of conversation. I saw some other customers come in after us and the servers started talking to them, smiling, and even laughing, so they're obviously capable of doing so, they just didn't with us. I guess it's just one of those places that already have their favorite customers and don't do anything to try and get people to come back.   Good food, poor attitudes = 3 stars",

    "text": "This review is going to sound harsh, so let me preface by saying that I tend to review Thai restaurants based on my own opinion of the flavors in the food.  This means that quality of service, atmosphere, etc. are not necessarily going to sway my review much.  With that said, this place had GREAT service.  Even though I came in with a coupon for $25, I felt like a regular customer within minutes!  The atmosphere is very upscale, and easy jazz music fills the dining area.  Oh, and they do have good Thai tea.  Now on to the food!  I ordered the tom kha soup with chicken (khi), the papaya salad, and the green curry with beef.  None of these were very memorable or impressive, unfortunately.  I also think that they Americanize a few dishes to some degree, but not as much as some other Thai restaurants.  The Tom kha was sweet with no lemongrass or galanga root.  The over all flavor was quite Americanized, in my opinion, and there wasn't anything that really stood out here.  The papaya salad was vinegary in flavor, and otherwise not notable.  The papaya was very crunchy though.  The green curry was suggested by my waitress as her favorite curry, although she didn't seem very enthusiastic about her own choice.  The green curry was a bit thicker than a lot other places, however it was rather light in the flavor department.  It seemed more like a stew with coconut juice mixed in.  On the plus side, it wasn't overly sweet.  The beef was a little tough though. I asked the waitress if the sweet sticky rice with custard was extremely sweet, or just a little sweet... she said that it was too sweet for her, so I passed on the dessert.    Overall, I would say that it would be very easy to fall in love with this place if I lived in the area, and I didn't have a particular taste when it comes to Thai food.  However, I can't say that I can squeeze in that extra star for Panna Thai due to my picky, snobby opinions.  Sorry, Panna!",

    "text": "First time writing a review. Here goes nothing.. I ended up ordering the Pad See-Ew (Medium Spiciness) and my friends ordered the Sweet N Sour Beef, Choo-Chee Shrimp (Hot spiciness) and Calamari for starters with a couple Thai Iced Teas. It was pretty slow in there so we got our food pretty quick. The Choo-Chee shrimp was really spicy. I would not recommend the Sweet N Sour BEEF, Stick with PORK! Pad See-Ew was a little on the sweeter side even when I ordered medium spiciness. Calamari was one of the highlights though, it just melted in your mouth and the breading was perfect on it. Overall, The inside of the restaurant was very clean and the service was great! With all that food it came out to $50, which is a little on the high side but well worth it.   Until next time.. Stay Hungry!",

I walked through the front door and the chef and servers were just staring at me for 2 minutes before i even got greeted with a hello or how may i help you? Then we get seated and it was another 5 minutes before someone came and asked for our drink order. NOT TO MENTION..... this was during SLOW HOURS... it was 4:30pm in the afternoon.... the only customers at the restaurant besides us was another table of 2 sitting 3 tables down from me. We finally got a chance to order after 8-10 minutes. I ordered the chicken satay & green curry with beef and vegetables. The chicken satay lacked flavor and marinate but the peanut dipping sauce that came with it was actually decent... but they only gave you a tablespoon amount for 4 skewers of chicken. The beef green curry arrived and i was disappointed by the flavor. It was watery and it lacked curry flavor... and the veggies weren't even cooked completely.  ....anyways... i wont be coming back. the food was too pricey for the crappy service and poor quality food. I'll rather go to Archi's or Thai noodle house down the street!!",

Great food and the price is definitely do-able.  Would go back there again simply for their Curry.",

The food showed up an hour later and the driver forgot the Thai ice tea. The driver told me they would adjust the bill and credit my card back. That never happened. Because the food is so good I decided to give them another chance, bad idea. This time I decided to pick up the food so 1 I wouldn't have to wait as long and 2 they couldn't forget anything this time. Wrong again! Ordered online and paid for it. The time given was 10-35 minutes. 20 minutes after I ordered I got a call telling me it would be an hour at best. Really an hour?!?! So I said sure it was already paid for and I figured if I cancelled it now I wouldn't get my money back. 10 minutes after the first call I get another call confirming my order. Then a third call asking how I wanted my tofu cooked when I had already told them how I wanted it cooked when I ordered and then again in the first call. I feel like I've given this place a chance and they have failed. If they could get the service together this would be a 5 star review.",

I consulted with Yelp and settled on Thai food.   The restaurant was very spacious and clean and the host was welcoming. There was only one other table occupied as I came in at a weird \"limbo\" time of about 4pm. I ordered Thai coffee and Basil Noodles with seafood ($13.25) spicy level medium. I gotta say, pregnancy seems to have made me into a wuss when it comes to spicy food. Either that, or subconsciously I was not looking forward to the punishment that is severe heartburn. The portion was extremely generous, I would say enough for two people to share. I had them box up about half of it and had it for dinner little bit later. It may appear pricey to some, but it was an entree big enough to share. My total with tip was a little over $20..so not exactly cheap for one person, but as I said before, the portion and the quality justify the price. They did not skimp on the variety of seafood either.   Their menu has a tapas section with many appetizing options. I am only giving them a four star because I want to try more of their menu before I decide it is emergerd the best thai food eva!  There are enough items on their menu that I still want to try, so I will be back for sure.",

Understanding English is a little bit of an issue with one or two of the servers but they try hard and are very nice.

TIPS: If you usually order pad thai, opt for the Spicy Crab Noodle instead (stir-fried rice noodle with crab, egg, and green onion). If you usually order yellow curry, opt for the Panang Curry instead. I've tried the yellow curry before and it's too thin for my liking. The Panang Curry is just like yellow, but thicker and more flavorful.",

I was hesitant at first because I heard their food was pretty Americanized but I'm glad we gave them a try. Called in and placed an order for pick up:  Chicken satay entree: comes with 6 nicely sized skewers of seasoned chicken, fried rice, salad and peanut sauce. Really good and nicely priced at around $12 a great shareable dish!  Beef and asparagus: YUMMM the beef was so tender and the asparagus still had a nice crunch to it! Good brown sauce that was not too salty and MUSHROOMS!!! Mmmm  Chicken Pad Thai: Meh. This was not good.. The noodles were way too soft and overcooked... the dish overall was too sweet.   The 2 yummy dishes made us forget about the 1 meh dish.. Portion sizes and prices are good...We will definitely be back!  Hot Tip: Togo containers are the plastic reusable kinds... WoopWoop!",

This time around I came to dine in during my lunch break. It wasn't busy which I appreciated because I was having a short lunch today. They had recently changed their menu so when I had ordered the \"monster salad\" the waiter looked at me clueless. It's now called the \"grilled shrimp salad\".  My salad came out as quick as I devoured it!  It was so delicious. It had just the right amount of spiciness where you can still eat it and not kill your taste buds. They were not cheap with the shrimp either. They put so much shrimp I finished the veggies and I still had shrimp left over. Writing this review makes my mouth water.. I want more! I want more! Lol",

They're very creamy and rich in flavor, I highly recommend them if you're looking for something new to try on the menu or if you're eating here for the first time.  Even if you're vegetarian, there are great options. Many of the dishes allow you to substitute meat with steamed/fried tofu. Unlike other restaurants where you're left with 1 or 2 items total to choose from, there's a decent selection.    About the service:   The waitresses here are nice. Nicky is especially kind, she always greets you with a smile, makes sure you're satisfied with your meal, and thoughtfully checks that your glass is filled.   Overall, I would definitely recommend this restaurant if you're looking for casual Thai dining.",

The Chinese broccoli on the pad see-ew has a very strong flavor that I liked and had a nice refreshing flavor. The dessert was amazing. It had actual coconut inside the milli cake as well in the cream.   But the service....  It was 8pm at night and when we where sat there was 2 other parties dining in.  It started out great with our server explaining the menu to us and she was friendly.  But it went down hill. We didn't get our waters till our entrees came out and I had to remind our waitress for it.  It was weird because she dropped off our appetizer and couldn't tell we didn't have waters??   Once we where done I couldn't spot the  Server so it was a while till I could put in my dessert order. Now there is only us in the restaurant with 3 servers on the floor. We waited for who knows how long for our check and when we did get our check we waited again for our server to pick it back up.. .  I hate saying this but as a server myself if I have only one table, that one table is going to get my full attention and best service. They where so attentive busing and setting tables it was like they saw right past us.  It just fell short. Service needs some help for sure. The food was great but I sadly won't be coming back. :(",

I ordered: Pad See Ew with beef and chinese broccoli- I order this to go pretty often and when I can pull individual noodles, I'm a happy lady. Often times togo noddles are in one big clump. I like that chinese broc. was an option!!! Flavor wise it was delicious and spiiiicy!  Combo Satay- there was beef and chicken, garlic fried rice, cucumber salad, and peanut sauce. I ordered this non spicy for the kiddos and we loved this!! Their peanut sauce is different from any others I've tried, thicker, but tasty. The only item that remained uneaten was the cuke salad. Maybe because I'm used to acid or sweet when I see onion in my salad, I took one bite and decided to stop. I wasn't able to taste either of those flavors and I'm unable to describe what I did taste.   We did LOVE everything else and totally look forward to ordering and dropping by in the future!",

This last time we dined in and decided to try out some of the other offerings because so many items look delicious. We ordered egg rolls (no pictures, ate them too fast!), massaman curry, crying tiger and jasmine tea.    The egg rolls were crunchy, yummy and as expected.  The Massaman curry was my highlight, it's cubes of tender lamb in a thick rich curry sauce with peanuts and potatoes. I've definitely found a new favorite dish here. The sauce was flavorful and the lamb was tender beyond belief.  I had a small sample of the crying tiger because my eating partner gobbled it up. It was the best crying tiger I've had ever.  Jasmine tea is my love, and the one from Panna hit the spot.  If you haven't ventured over here yet, please do!",

I've ordered take out here almost more than 10 times already. And everytime I've ordered, I've gotten quality food. It's always on time and delicious. One thing I like about this place is that they make sure your order is properly wrapped so your food doesn't leak. My all time favorite is the yellow curry. They always wrap the curry in a separate plastic and tape it. Never do I ever have to worry about my curry spilling! I feel like this is one of the only few places that makes sure your food is carefully packaged, and that is plus for me!   I will need to dine in one of these days!",

The \"golden cup\" appetizer was probably more favorite thing that we ordered.   Service was great at the beginning when we were one of the few patrons in the restaurant, but later on when it got busy (and with their delivery orders), service was really slow and indifferent. We were just about done with our food, and the chicken satay arrived really late. With all of the other Thai restaurants in Vegas, I won't be back.",

I ordered the yellow curry chicken (medium spicy), my husband ordered the peppered steak dish, and our kids shared the sweet and sour chicken (not the fried Chinese dish, this was fresh and pan seared) and the chicken chow mein noodles.  Everything was tasted absolutely wonderful!  My kids really loved the soup that they brought out before our entrees arrived.  The broth had so much flavor. I would highly recommend Panna Thai.

The pineapple curry was very good, as it had strips of shredded chicken, and a nice spicy bite to it.  The pad se ew was good, although to be honest, I think Pin Kaows is better.

Reminds me of eating on the streets of Thailand. They also have a great beef sate, its hard to find good sate, a lot of times you'll end up with a rough, dried piece of meat on a stick but not here, its tender and delicious! But if you're in the mood for something simple, try the pad see-ew, really good, the noodles are cooked so perfectly. I love it when I eat pad see-ew and there's that frangrant smell of the stir-fried noodles, can't really explain it, but it smells soooo good!",

I took my parents, my sister and nephew here when they came to visit me.  We ordered several dishes to share and they were all pretty good.  Mom really liked the Chicken Satay with Peanut Sauce and Chicken Pad Thai.  The prices are good for you and you get a lot of food for the price.  The atmosphere is really nice and the waitresses were all super nice.  If you drink half of your water or Thai tea the waitress comes around to quickly refill it.  This is the first Thai place that I've been to that doesn't charge you for a Thai tea refill.  I was very impressed with that.  My dish came out cold but that was the only negative.",

The food wasn't terrible but being next door to such amazing Thai places that set the bar so high (Surangs & Corner Thai), you've got a lot to live up to. We got   Pork Pad Thai- spice level 4 no complaints here, was good !  Papaya salad - spice level 4 but papaya was really soggy with the sauce and wasn't sliced the authentic way, which really changes the texture.  Vietnamese egg rolls - the neon orange sauce was way too sweet, no spice at all. Not home made  Sticky rice - even though it's only a $2 item it's what I look forward to almost the most. This seemed to be really old. The second we took it out of the bag it hardened up and was inedible. ;(",

My friend was craving for thai food and I recommended to go this place.We had Tom yum soup , beef salad and Choo Chee soft shell crab. Tom yom soup, we added shrimp, tasted little salter than usual. beef salad , it was good but there was too much dressing which made the salad very salty. Finally Choo Chee soft shell crab came, it was fired soft shell crab with coconut curry and very very salty!! The curry on top was so salty that I felt like I was eating curry concentrate and my tongue was feeling numb from trying to eat  that stuff. I am not sure if they changed their chef, but food has been inconsistent from last few visits",

We had a <a href=\"/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2Frestaurant.com&s=c5fe485af4df376130bee54f875814d79c4d7913e1258123b1206d2bdbf4873b\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">restaurant.com</a> certificate so ordered a few dishes. Had the Thai egg-rolls, which were delicious. Lighter and flakier than a Chinese egg-roll. Had the calamari appetizer and it was really good. Little salty but I like salty, plus the sweet chili sauce with it was yum.   For dinner we had the Pad See Ew, Green Curry, and the Asparagus vegetable stir fry with Tofu. All 3 were amazing, especially the asparagus and tofu, it had shitake mushrooms in a brown sauce, that was just a great combo.   Now Pad See Ew and Green Curry are a staple for me when I eat Thai, so I can use them to compare other places and I have to say this is one of the best places in town. Beats Archies hands down for sure. Proportions were big leaving plenty of left overs.   To top it off it was really nice inside the place. Subtle lighting with dark woods and stone work, make for an excellent atmosphere. Could definitely bring a date here to impress at a cheap price.",

Since I had to round it, 4 star it is.  The three of us ordered one appetizer, one salad, and two entrees.  Satay Combo - two beef and two chicken skewers grilled to perfection!  I'd say that Panna Thai delivered the juiciest beef Satay in town!  Yum-wun-sen (the silver noodle salad) - there were only 4 shrimps in this salad and no any other seafood.  I'd say this is seasoned to appeal to the locals since it did taste kind of  \"americanized.\"  BBQ Spare Rib - Fork tender and falls right off the bone!  The sweet BBQ sauce wasn't just poured on, it was completely absorbed by the meat itself.  Sweety Duck -  I have to give this two thumbs up.  I'd say we eat duck pretty often since we visit the Cantonese restaurants in town all the time.  The Sweety Duck is up there with the tops, if not, even better!  The decor and atmosphere are WAY better than the Noodle House 2 that's only one block away.  We'd definitely come back again!  **special thanks to Julie C. who recommended this hidden gem that's very close to where I live**",

My boyfriend likes this dish, but I am not fan of red/green peppers, so I just sneak a bite or two of just the meat. Pad Thai = Sweeter than other places, but always tasty. Pineapple Fried Rice = Comes with both Shrimp and Chicken which I like. I often ask for it to have a bit extra spice, but I think I like it better original.  There was a two large parties in there tonight, so the staff was busy with them - but we didn't feel abandoned.

The scallop appetizer is great, as well as the fried spring rolls with mango salsa. And don't forget to order their fried banana with coconut ice cream! It's not the typical fried banana dish.

I loved the giant golden elephant paintings on the wall and their Christmas tree made me feel all warm and fuzzy inside.    The service was fine as well.  The food is what deems Panna a 2 star joint.  We ordered the fried calamari and the pad thai with tofu.  Fried Calamari - Large rings of calamari were a bit tough and quite dry.  The breading had an interesting flavor that wasn't offensive, just not something I was eager to eat.  It was served on a plate of shredded lettuce, but much of the breading fell off, creating a swamp like pile of dusty breading, very unpleasing to the eye.  Pad Thai w/ tofu - The Pad Thai here uses a tamarind sauce, which tasted like Gochujang (Korean red pepper paste) and not much else.  This was like boiling spaghetti noodles, adding ketchup and calling it Italian.  The sauce was heavy, and slumped on my palate long after dinner.  Panna falls short of being good Americanized Thai food.  I prefer the authentic flavors found at other restaurants (where's the kaffir lime leaves, fish sauce, galanga, etc...??)   Bottom Line: Panna Thai is clean and inviting with good service, but the food leaves a lot to be desired.",

During my lunch break, I met my boyfriend here and immediately saw an unprofessional sign which said they are no longer accepting the <a href=\"/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2FRestaurant.com&s=0aab4cbd731f3d3b0d1453050d3abc56a8c80bd214e25469c7555b750dca8a51\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">Restaurant.com</a> coupon. I was instantly disappointed and I spoke to the waittress and said I had no idea it was no longer accepted and no where on the certificate does it say management may refuse to accept. Her manager cut in and told me she was no longer accepting the coupon. I said I didn't realize that but is there anything you can honor? She replied in a snooty attitude that she can't accept the coupon and it is not her fault and I can receive my money back from <a href=\"/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2FRestaurant.com&s=0aab4cbd731f3d3b0d1453050d3abc56a8c80bd214e25469c7555b750dca8a51\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">Restaurant.com</a>. I told her I didn't purchase the coupon and so there's no money to be redeemed except for at this restaurant. I asked for her manager and she said the owner was not working today and I asked for his card so I can email him and she said she wasn't allowed to give out his contact information. I asked when he would be in so I can ask him about the coupon and she said he doesn't come in everyday and she has no idea when he'll be here. Throughout the whole time she was be very rude and pointing in my face and I told her that because of her lack of resourcefulness and inability to be polite, I could not eat here so she right away told me she can give me a coupon for $15 and I decided to take it and order some food. However, the coupon was $15 off a purchase of $50 and my boyfriend and I could not order enough food to equal $50. The food was good but I have had better thai food with definitely better service. I will not be returning here.",

We had to order a lot though just to uphold the certificate. My bf got the Pineapple Curry with beef and I got their Masaman curry with chicken. For our appetizer, we opted for their chicken/beef sa-te (satay?) and for the first time ever, we also got dessert: fried banana (coated with coconut flakes and deep fried). All of them tasted good, really good. The service was attentive and friendly. The decor was nice and intimate. The only thing that bothered me was their very see-through glass wall. Whenever a car would pass by or park right in front, their lights would blind the ones inside. They need to tint it a little. At the end of our meal, we could barely breathe since we ate more than usual. I was impressed by their fried banana since I'm very picky with both banana and coconut, so I was surprised at how I did not hate it at all. I just bought another <a href=\"/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2FRestaurant.com&s=0aab4cbd731f3d3b0d1453050d3abc56a8c80bd214e25469c7555b750dca8a51\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">Restaurant.com</a> gift certificate.

The wife's pad kee mao didn't have the little corns, tomatoes and was just boring and not well thought out. My green curry with beef had a whopping 3 pieces of eggplant in it and they tried to make up for the lack of the beef's flavor with tons of heat when I asked for medium.  Enough is enough and we won't be going back. There are far too many other options in the area to continue going there for lackluster food.",

I mean, even though it was unnecessary and very generous, you just dont get customer service like that anymore.

My friend and I came here over the weekend at around 3pm; so no one was in the restaurant.  We ordered: Pad See Ew Beef, Garlic Short Ribs, and Papaya Salad.  The salad was refreshing, the short ribs had a great crispy texture on it and wasn't too salty; just the right amount of garlic flavor, and the Pad See Ew was one of the best I've ever tasted!  It was full of flavor, had an abundance of egg which I love, and you get to choose whether you want american or Chinese broccoli.  Awesome!  The only downside was they didn't have any mango at the time we were there; and it's in season!  Not good.  I would have given it 5 stars if they had it!  But I'll be back for sure!",

I ordered the cashew stir fry which has dried chile in it but I asked for it spicier and I asked for broccoli with it.  Super plus they were very accommodating and didn't charge me extra.  The pick up was quick and easy and the portion was very large.  It was definitely spicy and there was lots of broccoli, my one side complaint would be that it had a bit too much fish sauce for a non fish dish.  But I will just make sure to ask them to tone it down on the fish sauce next time.  Other than that it was delicious and I quit enjoyed my meal.",

I always order the monster which is a grilled shrimp salad, one that puts me in withdrawal after a week of not having it..     Stay away from the scallop tamarind dish and the steamed dumplings, two that I can recall that aren't stars on the menu..  Soo my issues come from the service, and yes I know that service may be lacking in a Thai restaurant.. 5 years ago!  I think it's an area that definitely needs attention and if their food wasn't as amazing as it is I wouldn't set foot in there again.      Tonight the server didn't greet us just walked up with a miserable expression saying \"something to drink?\", when did we give up on saying welcome, or how are you this evening or nice to see you again..  He took our order by pulling a piece of register paper out of his pocket, unwrinkled it and asked what we would like, leading to a deep sigh once I ordered two courses.  Mind you it's 8:45pm and the door says open until 10pm.     We finish eating our amazing dinner minus the steamed dumplings, not that they knew of us not liking them since no one asked us if our meal was good at any point.  Then that wonderful server came over dropped the check and reluctantly offered to box up some left over pineapple curry and rice.  I never asked for the check so when he came back I said \"can we not get dessert?\"  He said \"the kitchen closed at 9:45\" and I followed with \"the door says you close at 10\" it was 9:48.. his response \"that's what time the restaurant closes\"..     I was annoyed at this point and suggested they adjust their sign, or at least give their guests the option to order at 9:45..  Why let sales walk out the door?  I spent $50 on Thai food and undoubtably would have purchased two desserts!  Unfortunately we will probably skip this restaurant next time I crave Thai food and start a search for my next favorite.  It's a shame because the food really is delicious.",

My family and I a total of 6 of us with two little ones went in and the service was super poor.  There was only 2 other people in the restaurant.   When we went to order we just asked to have a chicken breast for my daughter and they said no whole meal...they were so focused on serviing whole plates they couldn't accomadate.  I even told them to charge us the full price but just a chicken breast is what I needed but they said no that they couldn't do it.  We asked for a side of broccoli and carrots and they said no.  It was ridiculous.  At that point I didn't care if they charged me $20 bucks for broccoli that is what we needed but they couldn't do it.  Finally my husband went to talk to the gentleman behind the counter and asked for the manager and he was very rude and said no manager here and there was nothing he could do.  My husband said we would leave so we all got up and went next door to the sushi place where they always treat us great.    The gentleman tried to make excuses saying it wasn't his fault and he didn't serve us and he was busy with the two other people in the restaurant.  They still charged us for food they never brought us and we were so frustrated that we gave them the money and left.  We will never go back ever and I would suggest if you want a stressfree meal not to go as well.",

My favorite is the sweety duck, although it's a little fatty, but very delicious. the other dishes were tasty as well. We really liked their home-made coconut ice-cream. It has coconut shave and mango chunks in it, very creamy and coconutty.

    "text": "Nice place. Very elegant decor.  Had a craving for Thai after studying for finals so i went during dinner time on a Monday night. Not exactly \"A\" material.  Pad Thai (Chicken) 7.50 For a togo order it was a bit...small. Other places fill the whole box up but one section was left empty for a wedge of lime and ground peanuts, that section could have had a few extra strands of rice noodle! Taste wise it was...sub standard. It was missing a lot of spicy and strong flavors associated with Thai food. Sugar must have been on sale, bit into a large piece of scrambled egg and tasted more sweet then egg, or sauce, or spicy for that matter.  Yellow Curry (Chicken) 8.75 Piggybacking on the Pad Thai, yeah sugar was on sale cause there was more sweetness then anything else in this curry. Had slices of chili but no heat. Very weak curry essence. Strong coconut milk presence.  If this place was an authentic Thai restaurant it would get Zero stars. But they advertise as an Americanized Thai restaurant so for that they get the job done.",

When we walked in the door we were greeted with smiles and shown to our table in a very nicely decorated restaurant with good atmosphere.  To start with, we both had Thai iced teas that were fantastic and refilled before they were halfway empty. We shared a bowl of Tom Kha Gha, which was the best I've ever had.  For entrees, we had the Red Curry with Chicken and Sweety Duck, both of which were fantastic.  The duck was moist with a nice crispy skin and honey glaze, served with steamed broccoli.  The curry had a generous amount of meat and the veggies were fresh and not overcooked.    Dessert was the house specialty: Mango with Sticky Rice.  Excellent, though it's seasonal, subject to ripe mangos, so take advantage in the springtime! Homemade Coconut Ice Cream is also on the menu, though we didn't get to try it because we were stuffed.  As mentioned in other reviews, the portion size is generous.  Neither my wife nor I were able to finish our entrees and it was packed up with extra rice to take home.  Excellent, friendly service, good quality food at a reasonable price in a nice environment.  Adds up to 5 stars to me!  Oh, and they deliver.",

Why do I keep on going to Thai BBQ all these years, ugh! I love Panna Thai! This is now my only & favorite Thai go to place. Restaurant is so clean & fresh, wait staff are so welcoming, attentive & friendly, big portions of food, very nice (food) presentation that they always served hot  & refillable thai iced tea! Woot-woot!!! I have seen Thai BBQ food & service quality go down the drain. One time, I got served with re-cooked chicken that looked & tasted nasty. They even get stingy with the thai iced tea refill so I stopped going there & with YELP's help - I discovered this place. My whole family eat here twice a week. Hopefully, they will try to excel more & keep everything consistent.",

Now, I know some people enjoy the coconut type Thai food with the sweet tea, etc. etc, but I prefer the Tough Love from my Thai. Panna makes truly hot, spicy food that can easily bring a grown man to tears. I'm sweating a bit right now just thinking about it. So, if you like authentic hot spicy Thai food, Panna is definitely the way to go.",

Now, the food.  For Thai, this left me questioning where's the flavor!?!?  Ordered the garlic garlic shrimp and not only was the flavor lacking, so was the portion.  I wouldn't consider 8 pieces an entree by any means.  The chicken satay appetizer was decent but a bit tough/over cooked. On to the house fried rice...there was an odd sweetness and I couldn't pin it but based on the menu description I certainly didn't expect it.  At least there was a bigger portion with this dish.  Needless to say, this left me unsatisfied and wishing I had made the drive to my normal spot.  So much for finding a neighborhood Thai spot.",

Thats what made me want to try it and it didnt disappoint. Though I had to order a side of steamed rice to help with the spice, cus no i didnt have an option of choosing a spice level. But, I would order it again.  Divine Scallops....4 scallops on the plate. God, they melted like butter in my mouth...but again. It was too spicy for my like. So I ate some rice with them. Lol it helps!   BBQ Chicken....it was about 3-4 pieces of chicken, comes with its own rice. What can I say? Its a classic. It was great.   For Dessert: We werent going to order any however the Chef happened to be taking a breather while we were having dinner and after a good 15-20 minute conversation about work and life, to our surprise he sent us some dessert, on the house! It was.....  Banana dipped in tempura and deep fried, on the plate came strawberry sauce and on the side a large scoop of fresh coconut ice cream. Wow it was delicious and next time ill order it.",

Last night we ordered a couple simple dishes and the were all terrible.  Soft shell crab wasn't crispy, the batter tasted like a mouth full of pepper and was soggy.  The flautas used to be my girlfriends favorite; now she won't even finish half an order.  The pork jerky was undercooked (I'm at a loss for how this is even possible).  We ordered the combo basil noodle last night and it was horrific. The thing with this type of dish is because there are so many components with different cooking temperature you really have to know what you're doing...this chef obviously doesn't. The pork component was well overcooked while the shrimp were half translucent still.  I don't mean to be harsh here but this was one of the best Thai restaurants in the US for a long time and now it's just....pesh.",

My experience at this place was horrible I have ordered several plates for my family and I and it was missing salt, food was eatable but not great. Service was really BAD, place was with 2 people the time I came, no greeting, and this girls has attitude. I went and sat at the table and this young girl was going back and forth and I waited and waited to be acknowledged by her and then a raised my hand and I said hi and she responded \" Don't you see I'm busy with them\" this couple were eating already and she only left water so I thought she was done. She come after 5 minutes and said \" what you want\" really is that how they take order. Well I said Thai tea and I'm ready to order and she said to me \" No\" \"wait for drink first and later you can order\". I didn't want to be rude so I did as she said, well my family and I ate and left and this young girl runs behind me to my car and said \"more tip\" I gave you food and service. I was in shocked this girl had the nerve to follow me for more tip. I gave her $9 and she wanted more from 2 Thai tea, fried rice, salad, chicken with no flavor and egg rolls that were cold. That's just off. No words to this unhappy, unprofessional and rude people that has no customer service skills. Because all they said everyone we want to order or ask for water was \"What you want\" really. This place needs to teach their people how to talk to customers. If could give 0 I would. Don't go to this place they have no manners and the food is not as this Yelp reviews said.",

We ordered bang bang shrimp and spring rolls as appetizers. My fellow dinner mates said the shrimp was on point and the summer rolls were fresh. We also had the wonton soup and tom kha with chicken. I do not eat meat but I tasted both broths and they were so so so YUMMYYY..tangy and lemony. As an entree I had the green curry with tofu, which I asked for \"spicy.\" Seriously, they are not playing here, the curry definitely was spicy. My one complaint about the curry is that it was really lacking in the liquid department, which made it more like a tofu entree than a curry for me...still delicious though.   Service was just ok, the waitress seemed to be in a rush any time she came to our table.   We will definitely be back!",

Still can't find a best Pad Thai in Vegas but Panna's pad thai  4/5 stars is what I give for my pad Thai ( less sauce will be better) . I ordered : bang bang shrimp ( not bad , very interesting ,curry style ) , beef salad (the beef is soft,yum ) pad thai ( first time see green onion on pad Thai but good), and Tom yum ( excellent ) .

Ordered too much for 2 people but finished everything, because it was so good. The scallops were very tender and the sauce had a nice kick. The duck rolls were absolutely fantastic. Best I've ever had. Lots of duck, tender wrap, and the Julianne veges in it.. The chicken satay was cooked perfectly and sauce was nice. Had a squid basil noodles that was very very good. The squid was tender and the dish has a lot of basil. Finally had a chicken mushrooms and asparagus dish that again was fabulous. And a special shout out to Apple who served us. Friendly attentive and overall great service. Wish she didn't give us dessert on the house, which of course I finished.. Argh..  Can't say enough about this place, will be back again and again. 5 stars!!!!",

    "text": "This restaurant is just a pretty face with zero substance. Similar to an Australian male stripper I once met. Really nice to look at, but once he opened his mouth I couldn't run away fast enough. On to crappy Thai food.  I walk in and am instantly taken back by how current and sharp this space is. They spent money in making it look appealing and it does! They were also playing some current American music which was unusual to me, but I liked it. Only one table was occupied by a couple when I placed my takeout order.   The order taking was slightly awkward as I mentioned to the guy (because I am always entirely too friendly and can't help it. Unless I used expensive, yet bad moisturizer that is making my f*n face stink and the smell is killing me!), I mentioned that I have been dying to try this place.. He asked if I have ever had Thai food before. I wanted to ask him if he had ever brushed his teeth before. Again, I was nice about it. I placed my order for Panang chicken no rice and he then said,\" Medium or Mild\". I responded with,\"HOT\". He gave me the look, but than wrote down my order. I paid and he said it would be a few minutes.....  I don't mind waiting because I am in an especially good mood these days. The only couple in the restaurant pays and leaves. The music is turned off. The music never comes back on. I waited close to 30 minutes in silence for my order. I would have waited longer if I didn't get up and walk towards the kitchen. It had been sitting there for who knows how long. RUDE. I smile, grab my food and leave.   Immediately I open the container upon walking in the door since I'm ravenous for some spicy curry. First impression- Panang sauce is really watery..... Second impression- Panang Chicken has tons of Thai chiles, but zero flavor other than heat. No basil or kaffir lime leaves. No complexity or richness to the sauce. Only pure coconut milk taste or lack of. Dinner fail.   I really wanted to like this place and had hopes that this would be my new go to Thai spot for date night, but they just don't deliver on any level here. My suggestion is go anywhere else in the area for Thai unless you belong to a Coconut Milk Meetup Group or something. In that case knock yourself out. Literally.",

I decided to order the garlic short ribs since this dish had been one of the recommended as I read through the reviews.  When I arrived they greeted me with big smiles and since my order was not quite ready, they pointed me to have a seat in the mean time.  The atmosphere is like your typical Thai restaurant, big furniture and large art.    When I got my order I quickly took it back to my office to enjoy.  I decided to order more salad then having rice.  I think I jipped myself because there was not that much salad.  However, there was plenty of garlic short ribs.  I give it an A-OK rating because there were some pieces that were rather dry.  I thought it was going to be full pieces of short rib, but it was cubes.  So I didn't quite have what I thought I would of gotten.  The taste is good, but warning that you will be burping that garlic all day long.  LOL.    I probably will return to try out some other dishes.  Seems to be a hit or miss and I'll be determined to find that special dish.  Every place has a special dish.",

I had a vanilla chai tea and it was amazing! I am a huge tea fan and I really could have knocked back 2 before my meal arrived. For my appetizer, I ordered the summer rolls and they were delicious. I absolutely love the taste of mint with the tangy peanut sauce. My main course consisted of the yellow curry with potatoes, coconut milk, and tofu. The curry had great flavor and even though I ordered it spicy, the peppers were not overbearing. If you are not really into spice, you can order no spice.   The only slight negative was our server appeared to be working a large amount of tables by herself, so she was rushing and some of the plates had a rough \"landing\" on our table. It was no big deal and other than that, it was a positive experience.",

The meat LITERALLY falls right off the bone..  Also really enjoy the summer spring rolls with peanut sauce without mint...  The only thing that is a turn off is the estimated wait time for delivery...  I was told over an hr but called back to cancel and they ended up delivering within 45 minutes... I popped my car tire and hadn't grocery shopped so I was seriously starving..  Overall love this place...  If I wasn't so hungry I'd wait the hr  with no problem!",

THe best I've had. Maybe they had a good day, I dunno, but it had a great amount of lime and cilantro with a serious kick. DELICIOSO!  Drunken Noodle- 5 star. AKA Pad Kee Mao.  SOOOO GOOOOOOD. LOVE.   Panang curry- 2.5 star.  Meh, I'd skip this. It was heavy on the cream and tasted a bit too americanized for my taste.   In general the food here is a bit more americanized than authentic thai. I like the decor, and the prices are awesome.   My fave here so far is the THAI ICED TEA.   I can really taste the black tea in there instead of the one's that are just diluted with a bunch of cream in it. And free refills? Too good to be True. That's unheard of in L.A.    Def Try.",

I did not receive one offer for a refill on my Thai Ice Tea from any of the 2 or three servers that were handling our table. The food was good though. I would have given them 4 stars if the service was better.  I went back to this restaurant again and it was perfect. Plenty of Thai tea refills and great food. Service was excellent as well. The restaurant is decorated beautifully too. I will be back to Panna Thai.",

It's a bit sweet but at the same time spicy and you can choose what types of noodles: thick flat, thin noodles, or egg noodles, and I got mine with the squid and shrimp, and they didn't skimp on that amount either which was spectacular. I was sooooo happy with my food!!  I also ordered the asparagus and mushrooms, smaller plate but definitely a good size, cooked well and the mushrooms tasted amazing!!

The mango with sweet sticky rice here is amazing. The chef makes it into a cute heart shape, and its taste way better than its look. You must try it !!! While other thai restaurant cannot offer sweet mango during winter, I must applaud its management that they are so good at sourcing ingredients and keep its good quality of foods at high standard all year round.   On top of that, I like the service here. Servers are always attentive. I always get greeting every time I enter or leave the restaurant. My Thai Iced Tea drink always get refilled (for free.) They are very nice and friendly.   Lately, I've seen they have more varieties of wine to offer.

    "text": "I'm not sure why I never tried Panna Thai until now but I'm glad I did. It was a rainy week this week in Vegas and after cooking something at home and it not turning out just right I called Panna.   I ordered the crab wontons and pork pad see ew. I have been on a pork kick lately so that was the reason instead of going traditional with the beef. I was really eager to try the crab wontons as I saw that it was made with real crab. Sure enough it was as delish as other Yelpers had said it was and I even told my husband he HAD to try it. The consensus in our household was that it was pretty great. The pork pad see ew was good but I'm a carbs person. The pork to noodle ratio was about 2:1 so I felt like I was eating a lot of meat. Overall the flavor was good I just didn't like the overbearing meat but if you are a meat eater than this is definitely for you. I have to say I felt like I did get my money's worth in regards to both items.   The next day I wanted to try the BBQ pork noodles. It's BBQ pork noodle soup and I really really really enjoyed the pork. It was tender and there was plenty (which in this case I appreciated). Yes, I know I'm picky but I felt that the pork to egg noodle ratio was just perfect. I also ordered the spicy basil pork. Now that dish was just ok...definitely not my favorite place to order it from as I missed the cucumbers that do come with it at other Thai places. Overall, I def enjoyed this place. They do get busy though because the second night even though we ordered it at 7:30 pm it still was a 20-30 minute pick up time. They deliver too if you really need some Thai food.",

We have ordered a few things off the menu, but my favorite is the chicken satay with peanut sauce (it also comes with egg fried rice and cucumber salad) and of course the chicken pad Thai. It has some kick, but not a ton. I def will keep ordering from this place and wanna try out their Thai tea or coffee next.",

I ordered  Pepper steak Spicy pad Thai  Golden cups  Royal duck Bang bang shrimp Pad se ew beef Thai tea  When I called to order I had my husband there reading off that I wanted and he texted me what I told him I wanted because I wanted to make sure NOT to forget.  When I ordered the pad Thai the male and I discussed how hot I wanted it.  The food took an hour to come and it was cold, but I was STARVING so I didn't really care. My husband pointed out that there was food missing so we checked and it was the Spicy Pad Thai. I wasn't upset, shit happens so I just called and the guy I spoke to apologized and said they will make it and bring it right over.  Soon after I get another call and it was the guy that I originally spoke and who took my order and he said I didn't place the order. I reminded him that he and I spoke about the hotness of the pad Thai and he said yeah, but it wasn't ordered so I need your credit card number again. He said I will leave a note when you order again to give you something free and I said no thanks, I won't be ordering again.  The food is really good, but it took an hour to be delivered and then they accuse me of lying and won't fix what they messed up. I will have this resolved tomorrow during business hours... Guaranteed!!!!!!",

Called and the person taking the order had a pretty thick accent. For, a second I thought, \" this may not work...\" however, the female on the other line was patient and kind she had no problem trying to help me. That was star number one! Be aware for delivery there is a $25 or $30 minimum, sorry can't remember & it was only last week Friday lol. Estimated delivery was 55 minutes and it came on time... star 2. I gave them a small request on how to deliver, I'm at a Airbnb and though it was a tad bit odd they had no problem with the request... star 3. The delivery person deserves a sky full of stars she was so polite and very thoughtful it bumped the resteraunt to 4 stars for me - seeing there's no button for  a \"sky full.\" And last the food, oh em... it tasted so fresh. I don't know how in the world they packed it to look so presentable for delivery that was a pleasant surprise. 5 stars for the experience.   It is pricey but I was aware before ordering. There was more than enough food. I haven't tried a lot of Thai food so the taste is different for me but it was delicious. Definitely worth trying out.",

My family ordered: Tom Kha soup, combination Pad Thai, Beef Panang, & BBQ Spare Ribs, Mango & Sweet Sticky Rice, & Fried Banana (ala mode)  PROS: * Free refills on the Thai Tea... And they even refill it for you without asking them. That's a major plus! * Tom Kha soup, Pad Thai, and BBQ spare ribs tastes very similar (and even exactly) to the ones at Thai BBQ * Mango & Sweet Sticky Rice was delicious! * Serving size is reasonable & sufficient * Their lunch menu prices are awesome! $6.95 - $7.95, you can't beat that. Although the meat would be less than from the dinner menu, the lunch menu includes rice, soup, and an egg roll * The owners were super nice & friendly * Cute decor inside  [CONS]  * Unfortunately, their Panang was just okay. That was a major bummer since that's my favorite dish. It wasn't as creamy & sweet. However, the owner said that next time we order Panang, we can request for it to be more creamy & sweet (and even mention for it to taste like the one at Thai BBQ). So, I'll give it another shot the next time I eat here * Fried Banana had too much coconut on the outside. My sisters love coconut, but even they said the coconut pieces were overwhelming.. On the plus side, the vanilla bean ice cream it came with was yummy  Overall, it was good & convenient location.",

Delicious food, good service. I was impressed by the menu while I was looking for a new Thai place to try, a place that is far from center. If you're already tired of typical Thai foods, please come to this place please please please. They won't let you down. At first, I wanted to order Crab Rangoon, Chicken Satay, Crispy Tofu, Duck Roll but my bf wanted Golden Cup, Steamed Dumpling and Bang Bang Shrimp. I know it's a lot but sorry, they're too really unique to make me want to try all of them. But finally we just got Bang Bang Shrimp - omg a hidden gem, a star, it's like Coconut milk-Curry Shrimp. Must try must try, if you're not a fan of curry, you can skip it. The Shrimp wasn't over cooked so you can fell the freshness, and that's what I love. Another one we got was Panna Sampler - Chicken Satay yay, Tofu a Eggplant skewer - uhm no  and Crab Rangoon yasss. However, Tofu&Eggplant killed me softly, its sauce is..... sorry words are useless to express. Please try. Chicken satay was okay, a little bit salty, but not bad at all. We also order Tom Yum soup like usual but it's too sour. The last ones were Basil Noodle - flat noodle with meats, eggs, onions, basil and bell peppers for my bf and Crab Fried Rice for me. He loved the noodle, it's tasty i think. My Crab Fried Rice had a alot of crab meat and eggs, it's good too, I've been trying it at different places but That St Cafe has the best one. Thai Iced Tea was a little bit sweet for me. And we finished 2 appetizers, 1 soup, 2 main dishes, 1 drinks, total was just $52 no tax&tip, we had take out the leftovers. We will come back and tell everyone for sure.",

Both of these we highly recommend. My son gets it medium spicy and it's good. The one time we ordered green beans, we were disappointed because it wasn't what we're used to. It tasted more like a soy gravy over green beans than a Thai green bean.  It's definitely good.",

The Thai food is authentic and delicious! My favorites are the Pad Thai Shrimp and Gai Ga Prow Thai style (dry-cooked with minced chicken with basil). I also loved the Seafood Tofu Eggplant dish. I have been eating Thai food for more than 20 years in places all over the US and in Thailand. The decor here is also very modern and servers are friendly and helpful. My favorite server is definitely Apple - she knows my favorite dishes and provides excellent customer service whenever I come in. You should definitely give this place a try if you love Thai food.",

Our waters were always full and I never had to ask for another glass of wine :) (They only offer beer and wine).   They offer a large menu with lots of different veggie dishes! I was really excited about that! I ordered a red curry with lots of veggies! The spice level ranges from mild to extra spicy. I ordered spicy and could of definitely used more heat... So if you like hot... Make sure you are very specific. My friend ordered a yellow medium beef curry and loved it!! My other friends orders BBQ chicken with veggies and fried rice. Both said the chicken was really really good.   Dessert consisted of a chocolate lava cake with ice cream and fried coconut bananas with ice cream, neither of which I could eat... But the lava cake got some raving reviews!!   They have some really amazing lunches specials that I plan on checking out. I am really excited to go back!",

    "text": "Two stars for decent Thai food. But tonight will be the last time I order from Panna Thai.  Let me recap. On 12/28/15 I placed an order and it took 2 hours and 13 minutes to arrive. Because of this inconvenience, I was told I would receive a free order of pad Thai.  Tonight I said to my wife, \"Oh hey I have a free order of pad Thai babe!\" so I placed another order with them. The woman who took my order was able to see the note on my account immediately which was great. She took my order, and gave me my total and reiterated I was receiving the pad Thai for free. -Not once did she read my order back to me-. (You will see why this detail is important later)  The delivery was prompt this time, about 40 minutes as opposed to the atrocious amount of time it took on Monday. I ordered the following:  -Thai iced coffee -Chicken pad Thai (the freebie) -Beef Sa-te (my wife's fave) -Chicken basil rice   I received all of the above as well as 3 free egg rolls, which was nice. However, they gave me chicken sa-te instead of beef. Mind you this is my wife's favorite, and if I order sa-te it's going to be beef.  So I call just to let the restaurant know, thinking maybe this is something that was miscommunicated due to an error in their order placement system. I wasn't asking for a handout or anything. But instead the woman on the phone tells me that she was the one who took my order, and I definitely ordered chicken sa-te because she read my order back to me. \"This is part of the rules.\" she says, so I must be crazy. My wife doesn't love the beef sa-te, and I must have ordered chicken. I responded to her telling her that it's not a big deal, I just wanted to let them know, yet she tells me I'm wrong and hangs up.  Needless to say, my family and I will be ordering from a different place when we get the craving for Thai in the future.  Thank you for the free egg rolls though, that would have been a very nice touch if things turned out differently.",

    "text": "I order from this location occasionally. The food is OK, and the portion is usually generous. However, I give the restaurant only two stars based on my last two experiences with them. One time I ordered some lunch specials to go including a beef Pad Thai. When I started to eat I immediately noticed the beef was spoiled and tasted disgusting. It's not just not fresh it's literally spoiled. So I threw the entire box away. The second time I placed the order online for pickup at about 7:45 pm. When I arrived the restaurant at 8:10 they appeared to forget about my order. I waited in the lobby and expected my order to be ready in 10 mins as the restaurant was only 1/3 full. However, I waited until almost 9 PM! They gave me a free Thai tea for my wait and I guess that's why I hesitate to give them a 1 star.",

Although I did not dine in, i did check out the dining room and it seemed very clean. The staff was very friendly and quick. I ordered the Chicken Pad Thai lunch special it was about $8, this pad thai was made with a little bit of thicker noodle than I have normally had on Pad Thai. It could have had a little more flavor for my taste, but it was still really good. It comes with an egg roll, and a small salad. I had a thai iced tea as well which was PERFECT! I really liked this place! I will definitely come back again and try some of their curry.",

    "text": "This is one of my absolute favorite neighborhood places for Thai food in Las Vegas. They have an amazing variety of spices in all of their dishes that really put them ahead of other options, and I am obsessed with their noodle based offerings including their massive ramen bowls, pad Thai and chow mien. (I know not on the adventurous side of Thai cuisine, but equally delicious!)   In addition to take away, the restaurant interior is modern and relaxed and makes for a great lunch or dinner spot. It's never super busy, which is great for a quick or long meal. The staff is friendly and have provided awesome service every time I drop in.  They also provide complimentary refills for their Thai iced tea AND Thai iced coffee. Have you ever had Thai iced tea or Thai iced coffee? They are the BOMB and rarely ever offered unlimited at restaurants. They also serve beer and wine, including Singha the greatest Thai beer to ever exist.   If you're in the area you absolutely must try this place.",

    "text": "My boyfriend and his brother and I all ordered take out we waited a long time to get our food! The waitress was sooo rude she was getting impatient when we were ordering. Then we asked if she can bag in two bags and she gave us so much attitude. By the time we got our food we decided to eat there. We asked for water the guy ignored us then I asked and didn't even acknowledge us. Then he gave us our water finally they never checked up on us none of that. Then we wanted a refill and he told us to hold on with hella attitude. Then he goes to his coworkers and proceeds to talk shit and points at us. It was completely noticeable. And keep in mind there was no one else there we were the only ones. So it wasn't like it was super busy. When we were done eating the guy came up to us and said \"are you going to get your fucking food?\" And my boyfriend said \"we're done eating thank you.\" Then the guy said \"pick up your trash don't leave it here.\" Then I butted in and said \"it's your fucking job to clean up the mess if you don't like your occupation then quit.\" Then we walk out and he started pacing the window like he was going to come out and get us. Overall the food was great. But the customer service was shit! I recommend not to go there.",

Tom Ka soup tasted like sugar water w boiled chicken w raw button mushrooms (didn't know those were Thai) papaya salad is pretty hard to mess up but it's horrible. Waste of money so sick and was looking forward to this. Such a let down. Don't believe the hype!!",

    "text": "Delivery took over 45 minutes but the online ordering was pretty easy and painless.  Beef Salad was the best item in my order.  As another reviewer mentioned, the beef was nicely smokey, and it was okay quality meat, not gristly.  The salad is mostly meat, with light lettuce and some tomatoes and cucumbers.  The dressing is mostly lime juice, which I like.  A good low calorie fairly-healthy choice.  I would have liked cucumber slices that were a bit larger.  Chicken Fried Rice was kind of weird, there were clumps that were really sweet (maybe it was sweetened eggs?), but mostly it was really bizarrely bland.  Tons of onions.  Not much chicken or tomatoes.  I would not get this again, myself.  Green Milk Boba was overpriced, the cup was small styrofoam (12-16oz if there wasn't any ice), 50% ice at least, and barely any boba ($1 upcharge).  The boba were super overcooked to the point they had melted down small.  For $4.50 I could have a monster-size boba somewhere else.  This place is not cheap, but still one of the better delivery options in this neighborhood.  Maybe I'll enjoy some of their other dishes more.",

The lunch specials were served with a good amount of food, not too much or too little. Sunday around noon was not busy and we got great service.   For dessert, I had the Thai sweet sticky rice topped with homemade coconut ice cream inside of a shaved coconut. Yes, you read that right. It sounds as good as it tastes too! Yummy!!!! It's not on the menu in the exact way I got it, but the waitress told us about it and we couldn't resist.   I need to go back here to try more items on the menu. I liked it a lot!",

I wanted to find something that was better than \"just ok\" and dare I hope for even friendly service? Well I found that at Panna Thai and I not only highly recommend it but will return. Most amazing Garlic Beef, which has been hard to find out here in Vegas. I used to live in Thai Town L/A for quite a few years so it's really hard to impress me when it comes to Thai Cuisine. This place not only has great food, but what really stood out was the friendly waitress/cashier. She was running around doing everything herself and never broke stride, all with a fantastic attitude. The place was clean, comfortable and you know it's a good sign when you walk in and the place is filled with patrons native to the food's country of origin :)",

Next was two scrumptious appetizers - potstickers and I believe was called yum yum shrimp - shrimp/crab in a curry sauce - wow! Next, we ordered three entrees - BBQ chicken, eggplant with seafood, and chicken with broccoli.  All dishes were well prepared - eggplant was ordered with no spice, and all flavoring a were savored with each delectable bite - yummy!! BBQ was moist and tender, some so rare to find in Portland.
