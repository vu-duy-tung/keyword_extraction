Are you kidding me? Petrus? Lafite? What?  You wouldn't expect it from this typically family-oriented chinese restaurant but they have an impressive wine list where you can spend thousands on a bottle of wine if you wanted to.  Considering their late night hours, I'm not surprised they offer these bottles. I'd imagine some high rollers come in here for a late dinner after some serious gambling.",

I asked about the lunch specials she looked borderline upset. I ordered the salt and pepper pork chop which was fantastic, I then decided to order the Crab Rangoon. About 5 minutes later I see an order of the lovely little cream cheese  babies headed my way...NOT...the waitress passed my table and put them on the table next to mine, ok fair enough they must have ordered them also. Not the case, 3 minutes later the other waiter comes and picks them up from them and says to me they are making me new ones. Not possible in the less than 1 minute they were in the back. I told them I did not want them. They should have left them on the other peoples table and REALLY made me new ones. But I will say the food tasted wonderful, they just need some skills in service!!",

There is a wide variety of dishes to choose from with good portion sizes.  I could make a meal out of the appetizers alone.  The last few times I was there I have eaten the salt & pepper chicken, pork, shrimp; sweet & sour chicken, pork, shrimp; whole fried Flounder, honey/ walnut shrimp, seared scallops and most recently the Lobster w/ garlic and scallions.  Their Fried Rice dishes are also superb.  I have not been disappointed with this restaurant yet.",

Service was pretty good, but they took a while to give us our tab after it got busy (I guess that's good that they don't rush you!).

I ordered Kung Pao Chicken and my friend ordered Cashew Chicken.  The Cashew Chicken was tasteless with a bland sauce, Kung Pao had flavor in the sauce with a bit of a kick but not a memorable experience.    The pork fried rice was decent for lunch special but not amazing in any sense of the word.  One plus of the take out of this place is that they will give you the soup to go.  The soup was very tasty it was a corn based egg drop soup.  I don't know why a native speaker would send me here but I probably wouldn't go back too quickly.",

We had ordered the Black Sea Bass, fried noodles, Honey Walnut Shrimp on a previous Yelp recommendation and Chicken in Black Bean Sauce. Honey Walnut Shrimp was quite honestly the best I've ever had. Fried Noodles were very good and the Black Sea Bass was good too. I've had better Sea Bass, but it was good. I just prefer my Sea Bass too be a slight bit on the sweet side in the preparation. The Chicken in Black Bean Sauce was tasty too. But back to the Honey Walnut Shrimp, that dish was the highlight of the night! Very happy and will return to Joyful House in the future!",

The menu is filled with high end culinary seafood, exotic dishes, and wine choices that would make your AMEX card burn (2-3k for high end years). My girlfriend and I decided to order the dinner combos, which turned out to feed an army. I am not kidding. From the start, we had three appetizers-wontons, eggrolls, and potstickers. Next, we barely scratched the surface of a gallon sized bowl of sweet and sour soup. Our entrees arrived, accompanied by a heaping bowl of white rice. In total, we had four entrees and barely made a dent in any of them. We ended up leaving with four large styrofoam containers loaded with food, and we didn't even spend $50 bucks. The service was prompt, waitstaff was friendly, and the food was excellent with the caveat that my girlfriend felt the food was a bit greasy. However, we both thought it was spot on and felt warm inside after our Joyful dinner.",

Don't come here unless you want to waste your money.  If you're going to spend this much money, I recommend Blosom restaurant located inside the Aria Casino and Resort.

The gf and I had:  - Cilantro, Preserved Eggs, & Sliced Fish Filet Soup (pretty good)  - Clams in Black Bean Sauce (nice and tasty clams)  - Sizzling Tenderloin Mignon in Black Pepper Sauce (sounds incredibly tasty, tastes like nothing)  - Chilean Sea Bass with Tofu & Black Mushrooms in Clay Pot (not a bad dish, but had I known the sea bass was going to be deep fried, I would have opted for the steamed version)  I think I also ordered one other dish, but for the life of me I can't remember.  Anyhoo, nothing really wowed us here.  Plus, we polished all of our food, which surprised us, because we thought we'd get bigger portions than we did.",

On this rare occasion when the moon was full... the guy wanted to charge us PER scallop. Weird!  Another time I was there I think they forgot to flavor the soup.

So I decide to search the Yelp and find Joyful House Chinese restaurant. Am I lucky? The food and service are excellent and no doubt to recommend this place.  My friends and I ordered a steam red big eye fish. The fish is made just right. If you know how to make a traditional Chinese steam fish, you know it is important to have good quality of fish, have to be fresh, and also the timing to steam the fish has to be just right, not too long or too short. We also have the coral shrimp, those shrimps are fresh and  tastes sweet. We also tried the lobster as well - I mean those over 4 lbs lobster. The lobster meat is fresh and tastes very good, can't get it from somewhere else.   Another dish that we ordered is black bean sauce clams, it is amazingly good. They are juicy, tender and \"big\" as a clam. I never taste such a clam before. As Chinese, we got to order a dish of vegetable - garlic baby bean sprout (the leafy ones.)  As far as the space, as other described, they are spacious and sit comfortably for a big group. Very clean place. Decoration is ok.  The service is excellent. The waiter and waitress all are friendly and answer all our questions. The food is served promptly. They even serve complimentary dessert as well.  If you are looking for Chinese foods and wants to get away from the Stripe. I would highly recommend this restaurant.",

Some of my favorites are Peking Duck, Eggplant and Pork Claypot, Salt & Pepper Prawns and too many more dishes that I can't think of off the top of my head. They have something for everything. Orange Blossom Beef for the less adventurous in your group or Steamed Fish and Sea Cucumber for the authentic Chinese Food Palates.  They have great hours, open late for you night owls and great food. I have tried quite a number of dishes on their menu and I haven't ever really been disappointed.

The cold combination plate had some hot items which was a bit odd but everything was delicious. Jelly fish strips were flavorful, the duck was not as juicy as I would like, but I was happy. Ham was yummy and the braised beef slices were ok.    Then we had some stir fried greens (well cooked but pretty expected), the seafood claypot had a lot of seafood (shrimp, scallops, squid, etc), fish sauce eggplant clay pot had a lot of sauce that went well with rice. Beef chow fun was quite good and I don't normally like that stuff. the pepper and salt pork chops was good but had a lot breading. but i loved it regardless. we got another tofu dish with mushroom.. it was nice and light (be careful though - it burned the roof of my mouth).  Last dish we had was some kind of beef in sweet sauce which i didn't try.    At the end of the meal, they brought us slices of watermelon and one in the group spoke cantonese so she got us an overflowing plate of watermelon --- on the house!  They even told her that if we ran out, we can ask for more. :)  yayyy for free watermelon.   We were quite loud/excited after being starved for a week from camping and road tripping in the wilderness, but they were completely fine and service was good.",

We ordered a shit ton of food for only 4 of us so Ill just laundry list each item with a few thoughts.   Wonton Soup (Cantonese style).. kind of blah and bland. I'd opt for the hot and sour instead which was exactly as its named. Perfect.   Rosy Duck, crisp, duck fatty.. Came with plum sauce which tasted like industrial cleaner.  Salt and Pepper Pork Chop, bone-in thin pork chops deep friend and covered with fried garlic and chilies. This was a hit!  Boiled Chicken with Chives, pretty bland and the garlic ginger sauce was too oily masking most of the flavor.  Combination Pan Fried Noodles, generously covered with shrimp, beef and chicken the dish over all was super goopey and not very appetizing. Opt for Lo Mein next time.  Beef Chow Fun with black bean sauce was good. The beef was silky and tender while the noodles chewy and oily. This was another hit!  Service was pretty amazing (fast, efficient), well priced and portion sizes were huge. They also have a humongous menu plus fresh seafood on premises. For late night eats their selection is hard to beat!",

I know Chinese food in general can be greasy, but this is way beyond what I expected.  They do have a fairly extensive menu and the quality of the food is slightly above average (minus the grease).  However, this has got to be one of the more expensive Chinese restaurants in Chinatown.  Frankly, I think Wendy's Noodle Cafe serves better HK-style Cantonese food at a cheaper price, and much less greasy!",

    "text": "What a nice way to end a busy day of running errands in the Vegas heat. My best friend, her family and I came here around 10:30pm. It had been ages since my last visit (I think I was 10 years old or so) ,so I couldn't exactly remember what the food tasted like, but at the moment I was up for anything in the Chinatown area.   We ordered:   Cream of Chicken and Corn Soup- pretty standard soup. It reminded me of egg flower soup with cream of corn. I don't know if I'd order this again because it wasn't anything special. I think I'd prefer won ton soup over this.   Beef & Broccoli- I was a little skeptical about ordering this dish because I always try to order things that you can't get at other places. This dish you can order anywhere and I was sort of sick of it from places like Panda. However, that is only due to the fact that I forgot how much better it tastes at authentic Chinese restaurants. Beef was chewy and tender, while the stems of the broccoli was soft. The sauce was typical and there was a perfect amount to moisten the dish up and I'm tough critic when it comes to dryness. I couldn't believe at how much the dish amazed me as if it was my first time trying it.   Honey Walnut Shrimp- one of my all time favorites at any Chinese restaurants. Joyful House will not disappoint because theirs definitely meets the standards. The batter of the shrimp was the perfect thickness, good ratio of shrimp to walnut and the mayonnaise glazed the entire dish perfectly. Loved this!   Steamed Flounder- just as good as it is anywhere else. My dad also cooks this at home and now I honestly don't find this dish as amusing as I did before. But I'm sure for everyone else they still love it. The fish is very light that is balanced with the soy sauce and oil. The chopped scallions also adds a nice touch, almost like sprinkles on a sundae. On another note, the fish came with all the bones intact and the server meticulously de boned the entire fish at the table. I was truly impressed because the fish still held up it's shape and it wasn't distorted into pieces (if that was my job, it would have been another story). My best friend and I both chatted about how it was our first time experiencing such an art. Apparently all Chinese restaurants are suppose to do this.   Thank you Joyful House! I was so caught up with the hype of other Asian cuisines from sushi to banh mis that I had forgotten the Chinese were the first to make a good impression on Americans. No wonder, your food is absolutely delicious and will always be considered the Asian classic. You may now be my Chinese restaurant fix when I'm in the Chinatown area.",

Everytime she is in town , we have to eat here.  She says no other Vegas restaurant compares and I agree.",

    "text": "This is place is legit!  The food here was awesome and the service was great.  I was with a group so we collectively ordered a whole bunch of stuff but I opted for the Hong Kong style Shrimp plate and the Steamed Tofu with Chinese Greens.  The Hong Kong noodles were perfect and not overly saucy like some of the other places I've tried in Chinatown.  I love the crunchiness of the noodles and the amount of sauce was perfect and kept the outer edges of the noodles crunchy enough to enjoy.  The tofu came out soft, hot, and ready to consume.  Nothing too special going on with the tofu but that's actually how I expected it to be so I was okay with it.  The servers were friendly and checked up on us without being so overbearing about having enough of anything or whether I needed more water after taking 2 sips.  Overall, a great experience!  Will return to grub again soon.",

    "text": "My husband and I were at a loss as to what to have for dinner this evening. So we both hopped on yelp and found THIS restaurant. Upon walking in I noticed how clean everything was, and I liked the way the tables were set up. We first ordered egg drop soup with mushrooms, I can honestly say that it was the best egg drop soup I've had in a very long time. It was perfectly seasoned, perfect consistency. Only SMALL issue I had, was I wished there was more egg, other than that it was absolutely delicious. I ordered sweet and sour pork and my husband ordered sauteed chicken with Portobello mushrooms in a black pepper sauce. The sweet and sour pork was fairly generic, but it was awesome. The pork was still crunchy even with the sauce on top, the onions and bell peppers were sauteed to perfection. An absolute great dish. My husbands chicken dish was off the chain, the mushrooms were in big chunks so you REALLY got a good taste of them, the chicken was tender and flavorful and the pepper sauce was perfect. I expected the pepper sauce to be too spicy (I don't handle spice very well) but it was great! It had a good pepper flavor, but it wasn't over powering or too spicy. A freaking epic dish. The service, for a Chinese restaurant, was actually really good. Our waiters were very attentive. I would totally recommend this place, great food and great service. KEEP UP THE GOOD WORK!!!!!",

The family ordered various items but it was my order of beef tenderloin in black pepper sauce that everyone agreed was the most popular.  The beef was oh so tender.  It was moist and soft as cotton and the flavoring was incredible.  I'd have to say this dish really made my day.  Other dishes we tried were salt and pepper tofu (very very good), eggplant in garlic sauce (good but bit too sweet), stringed beans with minced pork (fresh and very tasty) and their wonton soup (standard).  Overall, a memorable dining experience that we will repeat.",

I had a fried flounder with sweet and sour sauce (the special of the day $22) and honey walnut shrimp.  The honey walnut shrimp was good but lacking for the price.  The flounder was a mess.  It came soaked in cheap, and unpleasant sauce that came straight from a bottle.  I wasn't even surprised when the check came and I was charged $8 more for my $22 flounder because they had used an entire bottle of sweet and sour sauce.  Needless to say I was not happy with being charged $30 dollars for an item I ordered under the clear impression it was $22.  Overall my check came to $56 including a $4 sprite.  If the floors were made of marble and the ambience was that of a 5 star restaurant I could see getting away with this but this is china town off the strip folks!  There are hundreds of amazing ridiculously reasonable Chinese, Thai, and Japanese restaurants in close proximity.  This restaurant is a tourist trap. Chinese locals do not eat here.",

    "text": "It was almost midnight and all I could think about was how much I wanted some chow mein. Not the kind of chow mein from a cheap, take-out place but the real stuff. I searched Chinese food in my Yelp app and Joyful House came up first on the results. The reviews had me sold, so we jumped in the car and drove across town for a midnight snack.   The parking lot was a little dark, but it was expected since it was so late and everything else in that little shopping center was closed. The restaurant had about two tables filled, now three once we all sat down. Must be a good place if there are people here eating Chinese food instead of on the strip at midnight. We ordered soft noodles, salt and pepper pork, minced beef with tofu and sizzling beef (came on a hot plate). All of the food arrived at the table family style and freshly made-- just what I was craving for! It was delicious and I would definitely come back again. I especially like how late the Joyful House stays open and how accommodating the service was. Our drinks were never empty and our server brought more rice the moment I scarfed it all down. We definitely felt welcomed, even when it was probably past our server's bed time (and mine, too!)   I definitely recommend this place to anyone who might be visiting Las Vegas and craves some authentic Chinese food-- not that greasy chow mein from a fast food chain or the 'meh' broccoli and beef from a tray at a casino buffet. Joyful House does Chinese food right and I will definitely be back for more.",

Average-sized pan-fried Potstickers were good and I received my several requested condiments of sliced ginger, Sweet & Sour Sauce, Potsticker Sauce with onions, Hoisin Sauce, and Hot Chili Oil without any difficulty, and Shrimp-Fried Rice with carrots and peas was very good.

I've been here plenty of times but I wanted to write a review to let everyone know that they now charge for rice. I found out today after making a To go order. I asked to make sure rice was packed for me before taking my food and she replied rudely that she already asked me over the phone if I wanted rice. I remember not understanding one of her questions over the phone because of her thick accent but I didnt want her to repeat her question a third time so I just assumed she was asking if I wanted to order anything else to which I responded no... she told me my order doesnt include rice and asked if I wanted to put in an order for rice for $2. I said no and left. Before leaving the parking lot I thought that it was weird that the food I ordered didnt come with rice since i ordered food that should be eaten with rice(mapo tofu, salt and pepper pork chop, bok choy,etc.). So I went back inside to make sure that they knew what I ordered and to confirm I'm not suppose to get rice because my orders always came with rice. The second lady I spoke to this time was very helpful. She actually explained that they changed their menu and rice is now a menu item that is not included when you order food. She packed me a box of rice free of charge stating they are still transitioning which was very nice of her. I just dont understand why they're charging for rice when their food is already so expensive..",

So many must orders such as the Salt & Pepper Pork Chop, Imperial Peking Duck & Crispy Fried House Chicken.   Best food to cure your hangover though heavy handed on the MSG so beware!  Cheers!",

They have enough for mid-size parties.  They did not seem to have any Late Night specials, just the regular menu.  We got some bean sauce oysters, the flavors were good and oysters were fresh.  BBQ Platter was ok probably due to being late at night, they got the essential components, the meats were reheated, but the cold dishes in the center tasted good.  The House Pan Fried Noodles was good.  Joyful House provided a somewhat joyful experience for us late at night, although not everything was perfect, but the place seems promising.  The AYCE Chinese hotpot sounds exciting, so until next time.",

The walnut shrimp that everyone here on yelp raves about was not bad.  Nothing that stood out about it, tasted great, but not to die for.  Also at $16 it's a bit overpriced in my opinion.  It did come with a side of white rice.  However, the fried rice and beef chow fun were great values!  Both came out, and my wife and I realized we would have tons of left overs for the next day or two.  The beef chow fun was super yum.  Fried rice was fried rice, not bad.  For late-night chinese craving, definitely the place to go.  They have a extensive menu and even cool whole lobsters.   I will have to try that the next time I go here.",

The Kung Pao Chicken is a complete joke if you've ever had the real thing, closer to the typical sweet-and-not-very-sour dishes you can find at every bad Mandarin joint in America.  3) They serve the dark, soy-colored fried rice that has generally fallen out of popularity in recent times.  4) The ingredients are fresh; Beef with Broccoli was acceptable. It may be possible to assemble a 3-4 star meal if you can stay away from dishes with sweet glazes.  5) It's a clean, modern place with table cloths and decent furniture. You don't feel threatened by disease when there.  5) There are so many better Chinese restaurants in Vegas that there is just no need for this place...except when it's REALLY late.",

We ordered the salt and pepper calamari, beef chow fun, Mongolian beef, and spicy string beans with minced pork. The calamari was perfection. Nuf said. Ooh and a surprise of crispy jalapenos were mixed in. The string beans were flavorful, fresh, and crisp. The Mongolian beef melted in your mouth. Not a single hint of the tough, chewy, overcooked beef you may have encountered elsewhere.   No culinary surprises here. Classic Chinese cuisine done right. Really right.",

It's hard to find those in a Chinese restaurant.   My favorite is the Mongolian beef. The meat is very, very tender. The plate is colorful. It looks like it came out of a Samsung TV. I usually like my Mongolian beef spicier, but theirs has lots of flavor so it's fine. The portions are just right too, for the price. Their rice is always free so you have to take that into account if you think they're too expensive. Then there's the lemon chicken. It's very crunchy, and the sauce is not as tiring. It's not made up of mushed up meat so it's real chicken.   I can't say everything in their menu is great, but they always get my favorites on point. You really have to come here for those specific dish they get right. Overall the experience I get is always awesome here. They're open late. Love that.",

I agree that the portion size is on the smaller side, not like what you normally receive at your usual chinese restaurant, no leftovers to take home :P I always ask if they have snow pea leaves when I'm in a chinese restaurant (it's never on the menu, you have to ask), and Joyful had it - yum!! The honey walnut shrimp was good, but not the best I've ever had (a bit disappointed because of all the raves on yelp, maybe they've never had it before lol).  For parents: they have both high chairs and booster seats. Our waitress misunderstood us and would not get us one when we requested it. We found out at the end of the evening when the host noticed and apologized sincerely.",

Note to Owner: Please rename your business to AWFUL HOUSE FAKE CHINESE CUISINE.  I am giving it a one star, because yelp made me do it, in order to comment.  P.S Absolutely not the best of LAS VEGAS!!!",

Decor - doesn't feel  like Vegas, more like a family owned (which I think it is) restaurant in a middle class neighborhood. Live lobster tank @ MP.   This is definitely my new go-to for Chinese in Vegas, when I don't want chicken.  Ive lived here for 5 years and only ate Panda Express for lack of anything better.",

    "text": "Yum! I'm not a huge lover of True Asian food - for example, my favorite Chinese food is served at Panda Express. Despite my best intentions, I typically balk at the stuff people actually eat in places like Vietnam and Taiwan. You can understand why I was a little leery of venturing to a Chinese place on Spring Mountain for dinner with my coworkers the other night, especially when it was recommended by the Taiwanese guy! I consulted with him and he assured me that 'americans' like myself would still be able to find something to eat at Joyful House, so we decided to check it out.   The restaurant is quite large and well-lit, with a bunch of (like 15) tanks for fresh seafood that you can see. It seemed like a pretty legit operation and my coworker was already conversing in mandarin (or something) with the friendly wait staff, so we knew we'd be treated to a wide variety of dishes.  Speaking of wide variety, everybody ordered a bunch of stuff and then my coworker spoke to the waiter and apparently ordered like 6 more dishes. Everything is family style, so we had waaaayyyy too much food, even for our large group of like 12. Here's a quick run down:  Garlic Baby Bok-Choy - loved it. Not bland like your usual veggie dishes. Highly recommend. Mandarin pork chop - the favorite of several people at the table. Sweet and breaded, which is my fave. Sizzling steak - just ok. We were pretty pumped after the sizzling presentation, but it wasn't anything special. Not spicy (despite the warning on the menu). Clay pot scallops - served with rice noodles and really good. Seafood dish - don't know what it was called, but I really liked it. It came with shrimp, crispy noodles, and some other stuff I can't remember. My 2nd fave. Clay pot eggplant - good not great. Pork fried rice - standard. String beans with pork - good not great. Appetizer soup - just the soup they serve to everybody, I guess - beef broth with nothing in it. It was as good as you can make beef broth, but the 1 year old LOVED it, so bonus for that. Tapioca Dessert Soup - no thank you. If you're into tapioca, you might like it. Lemon iced tea - really good! Sweetened, but not too sweet. I actually had two glasses, which I usually don't do.   Prices were kinda high - $15-20/meat dish, but everything was good, including the service.   Any time I have somebody in town craving a 'fancier' Chinese meal, we will definitely take them to Joyful House.   Bonus points for being open late (til like 3am)!",

    "text": "Well, first off, we found that Chinatown in Las Vegas is nothing like Chinatown in San Francisco. It is a bunch of shops and mini-malls spread out along about a two-mile stretch of Spring Mountain Road, west of the I-15.  Joyful House has been listed as one of the best Chinese restaurants in Las Vegas, but in my opinion it's not THE best.   My wife and I and two high-school girls from Shanghai tried it out the other afternoon for an early dinner, and they, at least, seemed to think the food was somewhat authentic. We started out with bowls of West Lake Egg Flower Chowder, which I thought was somewhat bland. Adding a small amount of chili paste and a splash of shoyu (soy sauce) helped.  They ordered steamed chicken with ginger and mustard greens with mushrooms, but didn't seem to eat much of the greens. My wife and I tried the Pan Fried Spinach with Garlic, Barbecued Pork Fried Rice and Chicken Chow Fun. The latter actually wasn't much fun, as the noodles turned out to be really thick and hard to handle. We should have ordered the skinny noodles instead. I thought the fried rice was very good.   Serving sizes here are huge, so we had the leftovers boxed up and we found a couple of homeless guys down the street who really appreciated them.  We could have ordered a bit less and still fed one homeless person, but we got out the door for $95 (including tip) and thought it was quite a bit better than the typical Chinese place.",

Seriously you must try these!  Beef Chow Fun w/ Soy Sauce - Nice thick noodles in a savory brown sauce. The most perfect Chinese noodle dish.  We also enjoy the sesame chicken (although not the best I have had), Mongolian beef, and the sauteed sliced chicken with cashew nuts. Definitely some great food, although they have shark fin soup on the menu which really irks me, tisk tisk Joyful House. Such a deplorable practice (stepping off soap box).

We celebrate everything here, Chinese New Year, Birthday, and just our typical family get togethers. We probably come here about 4 times a year to dine on our favorite treat. We also get the salt and pepper pork which is a guilty fried pleasure. Some steamed chicken with ginger and scallions. Egg drop or wonton soup. Salted fish stew. Green beans or snow peas. There's are so many great choices! They also give you complimentary tea to allow you to enjoy a refreshing taste with your meal. I've never been disappointed and some of my favorite memories with my family, my boyfriend and his family have been here. Thanks so much for being a big part of our Vegas life!",

The hot tea is not standard fare or overpowering and I recommend the iced honey lemonade. The wontons were simple and the bbq pork appetizers tasty. They bring the orders out \"family style\" so it's easier to share. My wife chose the mushroom shrimp in lobster sauce while I chose the very colorful and quite delicious sweet and sour pork topped off with a side of perfectly prepared white rice. Overall, it makes for a great traditional Chinese date night experience.  You do need to ask for chopsticks if you prefer them. Recommended.",

I planned my wedding from out of town, so I wasn't able to meet with the Joyful House staff in person to plan the dinner. However, they were able to help me finalize all the details via email, and were very responsive.  They helped me select the banquet menu, and set aside a semi private dining area for my guests. Everyone had a great time.  Would definitely recommend!!!",

I've had everything from their duck, their chow fun, Mongolian beef, etc. I've never had a bad meal here. If you come during the mid-afternoon, they have really good lunch specials as well. Their seafood is fresh and of the highest quality. I've always enjoyed the ambience in this place. The tables are set up for a family style meal complete with a giant lazy Susan to pass around dishes with ease. If you want the best Chinese food in the heart of China town then come to the Joyful House. The food is legitimately delicious, the service here is always attentive, and the dining room itself is beautiful. The price of the food here is well worth it.",

    "text": "We were looking for a Chinese seafood restaurant and we came across this one, I know it's been around forever so we decided to give it a try. We came in on a weekday for dinner, we were seated right the way, there were only two or three tables  but it took forever to get the waiter's attention when we were ready to order. The waiter did not speak Chinese (not saying it's an requirement, but it is a Chinese restaurant). But he didn't seem want explain when we asked him about the dishes, so we asked for the manager. The manager came over and also had an attitude.   We ordered 2 item BBQ Combo with duck and BBQ pork, honey walnut shrimp, a beef soup, Hong Kong style noodles, stir fried clams with basil, and a seafood rice noodle clay pot. The food is OK but man, the service is beyond horrible. Everyone in the staff looked like we owed them money. Needless to say, we won't be back.",

    "text": "This place is absurdly expensive and a tourist trap. They don't have any lunch specials on the weekends or a lunch menu for that matter, so we had to order 1 plate of honey walnut shrimp from the dinner menu (even though it was 2:30pm on a Saturday afternoon).   Honey Walnut Shrimp with Mayonnaise $16.50 -- The portion was small (10 med/small sized shrimp) the shrimp tasted very fishy, not succulent and like they were freezer burned, plus they barely gave us any walnuts. We did not enjoy this dish at all. KJ kitchen's version costs less, gives you more shrimp and gives a ton more walnuts. Or you can go to China Tango Bistro in Summerlin and get a delicious, generous version for only $12! They rip you off here.  Their rice was super hard and dry - I have no clue how a legitimate Chinese restaurant can mess this up?   Also, I was shocked they didn't have the real deal homemade authentic sate chili sauce in oil. They brought out the commercial bright red sambal oelek from a bottle which tasted weird and sour, not spicy at all. Very disappointing.   Our 1 dish, rice and a soda was not worth $20, everything was unsatisfactory.  ----- to that person who messaged me to move out of Vegas because my honest review insulted him.   I will not! :P you're not the boss of me. but I will sit here and laugh about your idiocy and share it with all of my friends! :)",

    "text": "Vegas + drinking + 1am = greasy chinese food cravings kick in, STRUGGLE IS REAL!! My friends & I just finished our epic spartan race and idk why but my cravings for Panda Express Orange Chicken were going on overboost. However, my friends all said that the Panda Express on the strip (the only one open that late) wasn't as good as back in OC. I ain't about to waste my calories on crappy chinese food so luckily one of my friends that live in Vegas recommended Joyful House.  I was surprised walking in that there were still families eating so late, so place must be good. The workers here speak english, but if you want any modifications you better know your chinese. Thank god they spoke cantonese so I busted my chinese speakin skills on them lol  Wonton soup - Started off w/ this, I liked that it was just the soup w/ veggies, wontons, and bbq pork. NO NOODLES YAY! It was a very big portion, but flavor was on point and no salty MSG. In fact, their soup was actually on the lighter side and not greasy. The BBQ Pork was lean and surprisingly one of the best I've had.  Honey Walnut Shrimp - Busted my chinese to ask for mayo on the side and thank god I did! I recommend you try asking for the sauce on the side also, it makes a big difference. The shrimp was all nice and crispy, not leaking out oil at all from the batter. I think that if the sauce was on it, it'd make the shrimp soggy. Very good dish and they didn't skimp on the shrimp either! We still had half the plate left to take home. The shrimp were a good medium size, not overly coated in batter  Crispy Orange Chicken - I wished it were a bit more crispy, didn't really satisfy my Panda Express cravings, but can't complain. The sauce wasn't the same as Panda either, but more like a traditional Orange Chicken flavor you'd get at asian restaurants like Sam Woo. It tastes great w/ the steamed white rice. I would say skip this and try another entree, it's not a TDF item  Yang Chow Fried Rice - Fried rice w/ BBQ pork & Shrimp! You can get it chinese style which is Plain, Soy Sauce Free - Pan fried with Eggs and Shredded Cabbage, or American Style which has soy sauce. The fried rice was pretty good and again the BBQ pork was delicious! Really big portion, we had to take the rest home. Unlike most chinese restaurants, they didn't skimp on the bbq pork and shrimp! It wasn't too greasy either so brownie points for that  They give you sweet and refreshing orange slices at the end of your meal which helped the hefty meal go down! Our total bill came out to be about $50 w/ tax which isn't bad. It's a great place for value, you get a lot for what you pay! Hits the midnight munchies in Vegas and the food tasted pretty authentic :)",

Only gripe is the server...It's hard to get a hold of your server for refills (water)..You sorta have to go to them.....and ask for more water.

It's about 10-15 minutes (depending on traffic) off the Strip.  The restaurant was pretty empty for a Friday night dinner, but don't let that deter you from coming here.  We had the following:   1) Scallops in Black Bean Sauce - Pretty average dish.  2) Pan Fried Chilean Sea Bass in Garlic Soy Sauce - This was the daily special.  It's on their regular menu, but discounted from the regular price.  It's a thick fillet, not a whole fish, and I'd go with this over the scallops.  3) Crispy Fried Dungeness Crab with Salt and Pepper - I loved this dish!  The tempura batter was crisp and the seasoning was not overly salty.  The crab meat was hot and tender.  4) Crispy Fried Marinated Chicken - The crispy skin was fantastic.  The meat was fine.  5) Pan Fried Spinach in Garlic Sauce - Simple and good.  6) Wonton Noodle Soup - Good, but pricey.  I enjoyed our meal and the service was not bad with the exception of my drink order.  I wanted the Hong Kong Style Hot Tea with Cream, but they just couldn't get it right.  First, my drink never came.  We asked for it again and some more time passed before a cold mug of tea was brought out, ugh.  There wasn't even any cream in it!  We sent it back and the manager apologized for the server being new.  They have a lot of drink options, but since I didn't try mine I can't vouch for any.",

They have a late happy hour menu too, as well as a regular happy hour menu so it's a perfect place to go after late drinking or gambling.  The first thing you notice is the huge banner they have that says it's been named one of the top 50 restaurants in the US by CNN, which is pretty impressive actually.  Food is really good, I've ordered the Maine Lobster cooked Chinese style with ginger and onions, about $20 per pound (advertised half off) which was about 3 1/2 pounds.  Very tasty with the shell pre-cut so it was easy to get to the lobster meat.  I also had the clay pot clams with pork dish, which was about 95% clams and onions but very little pork.  Overall very good and I'd come back again. One thing, if you come after 2:30 am they won't let you sit so you have to get takeout.  Service is good and attentive too, which can be unusual in a Chinese restaurant.",

They do a good job on service. We hosted a party for a graduation. Of course the restaurant was packed from other graduates, food came out hot, fresh, and in a timely manner. Always had hot tea, ice water filled. The tables that had larger eaters were taken care of (they asked if that was enough) and even though they were busy, still pushed there food out first.   For those looking for high end Chinese food this is not, but it should not leave you disappointed.",

    "text": "If ever there was a place away from the strip that offered great Chinese food, this is it. I love eating Chinese food, and the one thing that I use to gauge their greatness is honey walnut shrimp, or walnut prawns. This place has the best honey walnut shrimp in Vegas so far, and I base this on the food from home.  Watch how far you drive down Spring Mountain--this place is right off Decatur and Spring Mountain in a little strip. Although the building is a bright color, at night it is still easy to miss. Parking is a bit tight, but it is worth it!  When you walk in, the Buddha statue is at the entrance with piles of coins from customers on his belly. I always rub his belly when I walk in. The servers are very attentive--and all male--and there is no wait for a table. The menus are easy to read with the set dinners on the very first page, but if you feel adventurous, I would suggest the more foreign dishes to eat. They are truly authentic, serving black fungus and jellyfish, shark fin soup, among other things. Most Americans would never order these dishes, but trust me--you have to try it.  We ate the honey walnut shrimp (obviously), black fungus and season vegetables, braised tofu, wonton noodle soup, and jelly fish. It was all oustanding, all in their right sauces and the vegetables with that nice slight char from the breath of the dragon. The tofu was perfect, and the black fungus was cooked just right. I love cold jellyfish, and this was one of the best that I've had in Vegas.  Overall, the meal was outstanding and reminded me of the Joyful restaurant back home on Guam. We waited four minutes for our food, and everything was cooked perfectly, presented beautifully, and tasted spectacular.  Who says that you have to eat on the strip? Save some money and go to the side streets. You never know what gems you may find.",

So there was a small possibility that I might have had a shellfish allergy, but after my 6lb plate of deep fried lobster perfection, I think I can rest easy now.  Man, I had forgotten how great this place is for seafood.  Despite being \"only kinda hungry\" my group of four proceeded to order a 6lb deep fried lobster, XO beans, ong choy, soup, and steamed fish.    This is one of the best lobsters I've ever had.  Lightly dusted in cornstarch, salt, pepper, and crack(?), then quickly fried to perfection keeping the meat moist and succulent.  The pictures speak for themselves.  Plus they were having a 50% off special on lobster, so our titanic crustacean only cost us $100.   The only disappointment was the fish, not because it wasn't good, but because we had no idea it cost $59/lb!  That 1.5lb cost us as much as the lobster and wasn't worth it.  Next time we'll be sure to ask how much the fish costs before we order.    Other than that, a perfect meal.",

As most Las Vegas joints especially in China Town, this place does close late past midnight...2am I believe. This makes it convinent for those late night munchies, hangovers or out of town peeps looking for something to eat at almost any given time. Definitely wasn't disappointed after a long absence. Food comes out fast...and full of flavor. The Roast Duck is amazing ... one of the most flavorful moist Roast duck with crispy skin I have ever tasted...in Vegas anyways! It wasn't drowned in sauce and just perfect. The restrooms are clean, and the inside looks pretty contemporary yet keeping food traditional. They did get Las Vegas Review Journals BEST of Las Vegas award in 2014 so that should mean something. Definitely a place to try and check out once or more than you would expect.",

It crispy on the outside with prefect light crispy type batter, the inside is spot on moist, and the flavor there sooo much depth. U bite into crispy outside crust then hit moist spot on cook pork chop and combine it with salt/pepper flavors. Divine. The string beans with xo sauce can say EXACT same thing feel eat it. The greens beans nice green, fresh, spot on cook bean that snap into them, and the sauce that the key nice spicy but not too much.

Where else can you order Geoduck and not too many places offer Abalone. I do note that these are very high end luxury seafood items and do cost around $60. $70. a portion. They also have a variety of many reasonably priced fresh fish dishes and daily specials. Free range chicken is also on the menu. (I've never seen that at any other Chinese Restaurant).  We ordered the Sweet Corn Soup for two. Actually the portion is enormous and can feed 4-6 people. It's delicious and anyone would enjoy it. Our waitress offered us a hot chili sauce and soy sauce condiments with the soup.  I had to try the Braised Tofu with Bamboo Fungus. (I think it cost around $12.00) The presentation isn't good but the dish actually tasted good. Bamboo Fungus is actually a veil from a mushroom grown in Asia. It really has almost no flavor on it's own but does have a most interesting delicate texture and is suppose to be extremely beneficial to your health. Under the Tofu and Bamboo Fungus was a large pile of fresh Chinese Broccoli.  The Special of the day was Whole Flounder for $23.00 so we ordered one fried and it was served  de-Boned Table side.  Joyful House was a Joyful Experience and is on my Las Vegas Rotation!",

Sizzling rice soup with seafood was $12 large avg price, crispy calamari $13.50, claypot eggplant tofu $12.50, house combination platter duck $29.95 (great appetizer cold dish but a little pricey compared to other Chinese restaurants), sizzling beef $15.95... All around attentive staff, quick food and major plus open late. I liked the claypot eggplant with tofu. Good vegetarian options.",

The pot stickers were ma ma hu hu. (Just okay)  They have a fantastic menu and tons of live fish. Lots of great plates coming out of the kitchen.     The service was the most impressive.   They made sure to swap out my plate after my appetizer and kept my drinks full!    Good work",

I can honestly say that we have done in there at least 10 to 15 times in the past four years in our travels. The food has never been disappointing and I can honestly say that there's not been one item that did not have immense flavor.  If you're looking for a good Chinese food this is your place. Without the water down Americanized Chinese feel. The food here is really high-quality and tasty. And if you're not familiar with a more traditional Chinese food it is not overwhelming as some places can be that are not your typical American Chinese menus.",

    "text": "OUTSTANDING seafood.  \"That was really good.  What was it?\" asks my Midwest white friend  \"Spicy jellyfish with bean curd\" is my straight face response.  \"Huh?  So what is this?\" he stupidly continues.  \"Um, sea cucumber with abalone\"; again straight faced.  \"What?!?\" With great exasperation in his voice.  \"And this is Santa Barbra Spot Prawns with their egg clutch, deep fried crab with fermented black beans, steamed live fish with ginger onion, and the soup was made from tiger shark fin\".  \"I think I'm going to be sick\" is all he can say.  Sorry I can't help but to explode in laughter.  Joyful House is a Cantonese seafood restaurant for the initiated.  I'm not sure if I should even write this review.  It's one of those places that long time Asian Vegas locals cherish.  Yes its won the \"Best of Vegas\" from the Review Journal but that barely speaks to it's hidden greatness.  So maybe they need to get to know you before they reveal their secrets, persist.  For example, you MUST ask for their spot prawns with the eggs.  Yes, they are now $12 each but they are worth every penny.  Eggs exploding in your mouth with the essence of fresh shrimp.  The spicy jellyfish was excellent.  Clean oceanic flavor accented by sesame and chili oil, and a touch of soy.  The sea cucumber with abalone, a tender sweet explosion of sea flavor.  Don't hate me but this is one of the few places that still uses real shark fin.  While I deplore fining and think it's inhumane, I couldn't resist.  It's been 12 years since I had the real thing.  Add a jigger of Remy XO, perfect.  This is not your typical Cantonese restaurant.  Yes, if you choose, they make great Americanized favorites (beef broccoli. shrimp fried rice, \"Peeking duck\", lemon chicken, shrimp with honey walnuts) but ultimately only those in the know will experience it's greatness.  Shhhhh.  Not for everyone.",

We run after this guy and the guy drop my sister's bag when he notice we are getting close to him. I speak to the manager if they have a camera in the restaurant so we can call a cop and report the incident. There is a camera buy it is not working.

By no means is the best Peking duck we've ever had, but still very crisp and tasty, and without the strip pricing. The duck bone soup is delightful. Very simple and fresh. We don't really have too much to complain about with the taste of the food we have tried. I mean, some are hit or miss, but nothing has been terrible. Well...except our last server. The first few times we came here our servers were fantastic. They put great care into the preparation and cutting of the Peking Duck. This last time, the server we had very strangely refused to allow us to take his photo when he brought the duck out. Then we realized why... he just grabbed the duck and started hacking at it frantically with no care. Instead of thin, crispy slices of skin we received just a few chunks of duck that we had to separate from bone and tendon before stuffing into the buns. It was disappointing. We will likely return to try more dishes but we'll have to search for a new place for peking duck after that experience.",

This is a Chinese Restaurant.  I wouldn't go to a fine Mexican Restaurant and Order Nachos Bell Grande or Meximelts for dinner.  With that said,  finding a good Chinese Restaurant in a desert would be challanging.  I am writing this as a customer with lots of Chinese restaurants tested.   The ambience was conservative and they are open from 11am - 3am The price was a bit higher, but not outrageous, but this is Las Vegas. Good wine list, but not really apropo for some of the food here.  The seafood dishes we ordered were extremely fresh We had a Stir-fried scallop and veggie dish that tasted very fresh and was cooked perfectly. The sweet and pungent shrimp dish was very good. The sauce was made from fresh tomatoes and not ketchup like other restaurants. The Filet Mignon dish was very good The waiter had recommended the sauteed young pea leaves which btw was excellent. We had a Fried Tofu dish that was standard, nothing special. They used good quality rice for the steamed rice.  We skipped the pricier seafood dishes that spiraled near the $100 mark or more, but all in all we got out for $75.00 (not including tips) for 3 people. We were too full for dessert so no reviews here  I would have to say I definitely would make a return trip here when I am back in Las Vegas again.",

Last Friday night, the Husband and I ventured over to Spring Mountain to find out if such a thing really did exist.  We were only expecting Chinese hot pot, not AYCE for the mere price of $15.50/pp.  We were easily persuaded and a quick peek at what they offered helped as well.  As they set up the gas stove and dual hot pot, they also provided two dipping sauces - one being a chili oil and the other a sesame-like paste.  Everything was laid out nicely on a couple of tables along the back:   * octopus balls * beef balls * pork balls * wontons * dumplings * chicken * beef * pork * squid * mussels * shrimp * napa cabbage * spinach * bok choy * tofu * tofu sheets * flat rice noodles * vermicelli noodles  I'm sure they had a few other things that I forgot to mention.  Also in the broth was taro and radish.  For dessert, they offered complimentary red bean soup and fortune cookies.  Service was surprisingly attentive.  It was slow when we arrived shortly after 10 pm, and there were a few diners.  Business picked up with at least two large parties also enjoying the AYCE hot pot.  The staff was good at refilling our water, tea, and asking if we needed more broth in our pot.  They had a lot of staff around, so that was a good thing.  Late night AYCE Chinese hot pot begins at 9 pm!   3.5 stars",

    "text": "January 31 2011. Dinner.  We had the Sizzling Rice Seafood Soup first.  The Flavor of the broth and fish was wonderful, however the calamari pieces were as chewy as slices of rubber tire, completely inedible. But alas, don't fret...  The Crispy Fried Chilean Sea Bass with S&P was completely without fault. Absolutely full of flavor, very fresh tasting (and i'm extremely conscience of fish freshness). A large center slice of Seabass. Just lovely.  We also had the Sauteed Prawns in Spicy Sweet and Sour Sauce which was very good.  in addition to the incredible menu choices, they have several live seafood tanks with a variety of seafood; prawns, geoduck, shellfish, other live fish.    Atmosphere was marred by this random table in the middle of the walkway heading to our booth - this oddly placed table was covered in clean restaurant dishes, glasses, napkins, and brickabrack of things that are usually hidden at the back or behind a divider, not sitting in the middle of the restaurant.  At first glance, I thought they weren't ready for business yet, but there were patrons inside and that table never disappeared. O, well.  The food was reasonably priced and delicious. Definitely recommend.  <a href=\"/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.joyfulhouselv.com%2Fmenu.html&s=a6e51170007587902ce1e065585d37c7443ad9b1a192d22a5334345bcc239aba\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">joyfulhouselv.com/menu.h...</a>",

    "text": "So from the reviews I went to this sorry establishment.  I actually created an account just to write about this nasty place. Beware: They are hidden under the guise of a chinese restaurant.  So I took my boyfriend and his friend, both white yet have a pallette for good chinese food.  The first sign this place might be a problem: No chinese patrons! ALL white people and I mean all white except for me and the staff.  I have to admit we went there twice just to confirm our initial opinion.  Food is not fresh, they lie when they say the fish dish is 50% off. Really??!! $19 for a fried fish.  Do you mean to tell me that the fish was originally $38.  No respectable chinese person would ever pay $38 for a fried fish, even 19 bucks for this low grade, rotten tasting fish. Yuck!  It tasted like it had been sitting in sewer water.    I also had chow fun, garlic spinach, minced pork with salty fish, roast duck and won ton soup.  The only good dish was the won ton soup. How pathetic!  I could tell the food is not fresh.  I agree with a previous reviewer when he was wondering where all the duck meat was on the supposed duck.. All I got was greasy skin and bones.  My journey for great, off the strip chinese food continues.",

Not too salty.  Just right.  - Shanghai Dumplings aka Xiao Lung Bao.  OMG.  These are delicious.  The skin was perfect.  Not too thick and not too thin so the soup stayed where it belongs - inside the dumpling.  I was shocked to find out that it was only the 2nd day since they began selling these.  The waiter said that they were doing a test run to see how people would like it.  If I lived in the area, I would definitely come back for these dumplings.  With the first bite you can tell that they use high quality ingredients and they don't skimp on the meat at all.  Okay, so maybe we're more fans of the xiao lung bao.  I'll have to revisit the next time I'm in LV.  In the mean time, you really need to come and try these before they stop making them.  This might turn their lunch business around!",

I've been to Joyful House many times and it's pretty consistently good.  My favorite thing to get here are the steamed oysters that you order individually.  I rarely am able to find this dish anywhere else but it is just so amazing.  Oysters steamed with black bean sauce and globs of garlic on top...How could that ever not be good?  Other stuff I've had that were really good are: Sizzling Scallops with Black Bean Sauce and Steamed Live Rock Cod (at $80 it was a little pricey but it was divine).  Most of other items I've had were decent.  The only thing I've had here that was bad was the dessert.  I ordered the ice cream mochi and the mochi skin was dried up and not chewy, probably due the packaging not being sealed properly.  I might've been able to send it back but I didn't ask.  The fried ice cream wasn't good either.  Oh, and this place is open til 3am!  Ideal for blowing some money on seafood after a night of fruitful gambling (or eating your sorrows away if you lose).",

On top of that, their food was pretty pricey, which included $9 for just chicken fried rice.   I also ordered clams with vermicelli in special sauce as well as walnut pr0nz. The pr0nz were the most expensive, which was $14 bucks. As good as they were, they only put in roughly 7 or so pr0nz in the to-go box. I don't get it. I was expecting more than that. The clams and vermicelli was way too salty, and there were hardly any vermicelli noodles in it. I appreciate there being a good amount of clams, but unfortunately the sauce was more like a soup. The fried rice didn't have much flavor and it was too salty for my tastes as well.   Service was cool though. All the staff were very helpful in making sure I was being helped. Sadly, I wasn't too fond of the food. I'd like to give this place another chance when I'm in town again, but for now 2 stars.",

The calamari was pretty good, a little overrated but came out nice and crispy w/ salt and red pepper seasoning and some sliced Serrano peppers that were hella spicy.  The clams in black bean sauce wasn't that good, the sauce was super salty (we ordered it after reading all the rave reviews on it).  The sesame chicken was good, it's our safe go to dish whenever we eat Chinese food.  Our bill came out to $47.24 including a HongKong iced tea that was never refilled, a little disappointing since it cost $3.75.  Perhaps I'm just cheap but I'm used to paying $2.50~ for iced tea w/ unlimited refills.  Another disappointment was the cleanliness, lots of dust on the wood window sills along the restaurant.  Makes you wonder what the kitchen looks like.  Better get to cleaning before Darcy Spears hits them up and they end up on Action 13 new's Dirty Dining!  Eeeks.",

It ranges from roasted duck, fried shrimp, pork, and veggies that you can pick from. It comes with an egg roll and another fried app, looking like a samosa. It also comes with a free drink all for $10!  That being said I probably won't be returning for 2 reasons. 1) food 2) service  The food I ordered was the salt n pepper fried shrimp lunch special and a salt n pepper fried pork a la carte. The shrimp was good 4/5 nothing spectacular but could order again. The fried pork was terrible. The flavor was there, however 3/4 of the pieces was just fried fat. Barley any meat in any of the pieces 1/5. The egg roll wasn't great 1/5. Samosa was pretty good 4/5. There was also a corn soup and I was super hyped! I love Asian corn soup, unfortunately it was luke warm and too gooey I believe there was too much corn starch added in it.  Service. I sat down and the waiter was friendly (probably the only good part of service). I had to ask for the lunch special menu, maybe because I came late they didn't have it on the table. Then I went to order and looked around the room my waiter was busy and there was a waitress available. We made eye contact then went on her phone... I also had to ask from some condiments, like vinegar. It goes great with fried foods!  My waiter pretty much never checked on me until I asked. I had to ask him to come over 4 times. 1 for lunch special 2 to order 3 to get vinegar 4 for the check.  If you're in China town there's plenty other spots to check out",

I mean, you can (and they kind of are), but you're far better off doing their specialty dishes like the live seafood (always check the specials!) and hot pot.   If you're not that adventurous, it's okay. You will be pleased with anything cooked salt and pepper style- shrimp (get it with the shell on), pork chops, and calamari (shout out to Amelinda for the suggestion!), are all good but the squid is best.   NOTE: Despite the old-school diner-style exterior, it's nice inside with linen table cloths and waiters in vests. Maybe opt for takeout if you're wearing gym clothes.",

Good thing was that this restaurant opened pretty late.  We got here at around 9 PM, and ordered 5 dishes:  - Wonton soup: which we split into 5 small bowls. Decent - Peking duck: was ok. not excellent. A little dry and small compared to other places - green with mushroom: The green was quite bitter. Plus, in the menu it was showing baby bok choy. What we actually got was the mustard green, which was misleading. - Mapo Tofu: was pretty salty - orange chicken: was better than Panda Express, which saved the salty mapo tofu.  Came out $78 for 4 people which wasn't too bad.",

    "text": "This place has really gone downhill in the last four years. My family and I used to dine here frequently in 2013, however, visits were tainted by inconsistent food quality. Eventually, and admittedly influenced by terrible SNHD ratings, I stopped coming here altogether.  Fast forward to December 2016. Prompted by my parents' yearning to dine here, I decided to give Joyful House another chance, hoping that the time gave them the opportunity to improve. This initial return visit was promising! We ordered all our usual favorites, Kung Pao Shrimp, Beef Chow Fun, Salt and Pepper Calamari, Mapo Tofu, Black Bean Chinese Broccoli with Chicken, and a new dish, Combination Hong Kong-Style Crispy Noodles. Everything was great! The food was as I remembered and it was a fine experience.  About a month later, my family wanted to eat Chinese food, so we figured we'd go back to JH based on our recent experience. This time, there were six of us, so on top of everything we ordered last time, we also got an additional dish (I honestly can't remember because it was so unmemorable!). First, the food didn't taste the same; it was distinctively worse! Second, the portions were really awkward. The tofu in the Mapo Tofu only covered half of the plate (Note: The same plate was used for this dish during every one of my visits) and there was substantially less shrimp in the Kung Pao Shrimp (again, it didn't even cover the normal plate!). I'm not a stranger to restaurants trying to discreetly cut portions, but this seemed suspicious. So, I decided to inquire...  Me: It seems to be less food... there's nothing here... *pointing to the empty sections of the dishes* Server: It's the same. Me: But, it's not. We were just here last month. We ordered the same food and there was a lot more of it. Server: You must have ordered two of it. Me: Uhh, no we ordered just one like always.  The man denied the portions being smaller and insisted that our previous dish had more food because we ORDERED TWO. Umm, WTF? Nevermind the overall ridiculous nature of this comment, why would you put two servings of a dish on a plate that is meant for one serving of that same dish??  Needless to say, I AM NEVER GOING BACK. It's obvious people don't think before they speak as conversations like this accomplish nothing. But regardless, the gamble on their food quality is just not worth the trouble. Plus, there are soooo many better options in town, so you'd be better off staying away from JH.",

    "text": "This was my first time here after my family had discovered this place on their own when they last visited Vegas. They were very adamant to bring me here knowing my love for Chinese food and how great the food is here.  We came here for lunch. They have a wide variety of items on the menu to choose from but it was just only the 3 of us, so we limited ourselves to choosing 5 items.   We ordered chicken fried rice, kung pao chicken, beef and broccoli, steamed vegetables, and hot and sour soup.   I love that you can customize your order to your taste. We told the waitress if the chef can add more garlic and chili paste to our order and it was honored without hesitation. It is probably the best Chinese food I've had in Nevada.   Prices are affordable. It's definitely very inexpensive for what you would pay at a fancy Chinese restaurant on the strip. And the food is customizable to your taste.   The staff was very polite and courteous. The reason for my 1 star deduction: The service was a little slow. It definitely took longer for someone to notice us when we needed assistance at our table. The person managing the front house would suddenly disappear at times. I don't know if there are more workers but when I was there, there was only one person waiting on tables.   Above all, Joyful House is great place to enjoy delicious Chinese food in Vegas.",

I've been coming here for years and we liked this place so much we'd come at least 2-3 times a week for lunch and other times for take out. I highly recommend the tenderloin beef in black pepper sauce with portabella mushrooms, their fried rice and spicy crispy shirmp.  The prices have been on increasing regularly and the amount of food has gone down drastically, not good business. This last time I went for dinner with my parents and we all noticed how small the portions have gotten, it was really bad and that irritated me. The only good thing is that the quality of the food is still there but their competition is very close by (less than a mile down the road) and they've been consistent for years.",

Their menu comes with gorgeous pictures of their entrees, but unfortunately it doesn't transfer over to the real deal.   As this is a family style restaurant, we wanted to get around 6 - 7 items to share amongst each other. The entrees we got were;  Peking Duck: probably one of their best things here, good sized duck, lots of meat, very crispy skin, comes with the white bun and colorful shrimp chips, wasn't overly salty.  BBQ Combination Platter 1/2 size: This was my favorite along with the duck, I probably would have just gone with the full order and just taken off something else we ordered, the dish comes with fried chicken, jelly fish, pork loaf slices, meat loaf slices, and cha shu pork.  Honey Walnut Shrimp: Disappointing portion size, there was literally like 7 pieces of shrimp on there.....for $16 bux? Man we got jipped hard, I probably would recommend putting that money into a different dish. Clams in vermicelli special broth: clams were good but the broth wasn't that special, it was sort of bland, but it was different than the usual ways people order clams at Chinese restaurants. Steamed Egg plant with garlic sauce: Wasn't really garlic sauce, more like just sauteed egg plants with crushed garlic sprinkled on top, so technically, it needed some sauce. Yang Chow Fried Rice: decent, no real complaints from this, probably need some more salt. Pan Fried Chinese Broccoli: probably our only real healthy dish, it was good, nothing memorable from it, but we did finish it.  Overall, this restaurant is a decent Chinese joint.",

There was 7 of us and we had to keep trying to find our server to get more tea, not once did our server ask how anything was. I arrived after my mom and sister (we were coming from church and got stuck at a traffic signal that was out),when I did get there the server NEVER ONCE asked me if I needed or wanted anything. I guess that she just assumed that my kids and I were alright with what very little food was left from what my mom, sister and nieces were picking at. It wasn't at all busy, they didn't appear short staffed, just sheer negligence.  The icing on the cake was being on the phone with a friend this morning and her asking me what I did for mother's day and her responding that the last her and get husband were there they had awful service too. It was just the two of them and it wasn't busy then either so it couldn't be attributed to the size of their party, just bad service all around. My friend said her and her husband will never be going back, my mother said the same yesterday and I have to say I agree with both of them. Such a shame too because their menu choices are vast and the food wasn't bad.",

The last time I went to a Casino Chinese restaurant, I paid $15 for pork fried rice and you only get a third of what you would here.  What to get here - rosy duck and rosy chicken are always delicious - crispy skin with just the right amount of fat that melts in you mouth. Hot and sour soup and chicken corn soup are also a must try.  For the veggie and tofu lovers the braised tofu with black mushrooms in brown sauce and the eggplant in garlic sauce is a must try.  Also the pepper shrimp (of course with the shell on) is tasty - in fact it was so good we had to order another plate last time.  I tried the cucumber salad and it was ok but I like mine a bit tangier and more garlic.  This is a place where you would bring overseas Chinese guests to.",

You can get a dinner for around $10 if you a stick with a noodle dish or simpler stir fry or clay pot. You can also splurge on a Peking duck or their market price seafood up to $70/lb. I chose to go a little less expensive tonight.    The eggplant tofu clay pot was delicious! It has a strange shrimp pate in the middle of the eggplant which was unnerving at first but I loved it.  The waiter was extremely helpful and nice.  On a Friday night at 630pm our food took only 10 minutes!  I would definitely recommend and will return!",

We had the basic salt and pepper pork chops, HK style seafood noodles, Chinese mustard greens with garlic and 1/2 order of roasted duck for $60!   The flavor was ordinary, nothing fancy.

No brown rice, you have to say \"no msg\"... Get with the program. Seafood is pricy and mediocre. If you are going to charge the same amount as Jasmin in the Bellagio, then bring on the waterworks show and delicious food. I'm not going back there. Money is not the issue--the quality has gone down.  I am merely recommending Jasmine as an alternate spot.",

At first I thought that was really weird...Japanese ramen at a Chinese restaurant? But wow! It's delicious. I'm originally from LA and we have a lot of amazing ramen places, but this beats them all. Seriously. Shinsengumi? Foo Foo Tei? Not as good as Joyful. This actually tastes like ramen from Japan (except their weird tomato flavored one). They only have about 3 flavors and it runs on the salty side (like ramen from Japan). Portion sizes are good, but most of all the taste is delicious. I just wish it was closer to home.",

One of Funniest things I ever heard in my life the owner or maybe not was talking to a couple next to our table saying I require my staff to speak English. Really?  I asked for a jack and coke what came to the table was regular coke. I asked the server what's up? He said we don't have that. I said take the coke away he gave to the couple sitting next to us.  Joyful house! Our shrimp in lobster sauce came out with canned mushrooms strange.  My wife Asian was laughing. She said check out your fork I think they used that one to fix the drain in the kitchen seems the forks and spoons have been there sense 1980's it wouldn't be so bad if the food was really fantastic. Costco has GREAT deals on quality table wear on MLK (TIP OF THE DAY) I asked the server what is in the dumplings he said chicken. I asked if they had shrimp of pork dumpling he said you can go up the street if you want that. OMG! I said we will try the dumplings how many do you get ?  He said 5 - I said r u sure the menu says 6. He said 5 only. Ok served 6.  Keep in mind we went in early before 5pm to check this place out. I was here 12 yrs ago and it was pretty good. How many signs do you need that say vote #1 in the 2011 RJ readers poll inside your restaurant? I think I counted 6 big ones and a CNN international one blocking the front door.  Don't believe everything u read. It's  Dec21st we are all still alive and the food is below average. RJ readers poll is rigged.  Look I have been to Asian restaurants around the world this place is NOT in the top 100.  Maybe the real employee's are on vacation?  Hmmmmm...",

So we rolled in at about 1am, no problem getting a table!  The service was great and the food was as yummy as I remembered.

The food was really good too.  It came with hot and sour soup, egg rolls, dumplings, and another appetizer, pork fried rice, chicken chowmein, lemon chicken, and sizzling beef.  Seriously enough food to feed ALOT more than just 2.  Also, I forgot my credit card on the table and before I even made it out the door the waiter had handed it to me, making sure I didn't forget it. Also, the two hosts of the restaurant came to our table both while we ate, and after to make sure we had enjoyed our food.    Our 2 year old son also really enjoyed the huge fish tanks that had live fish and lobsters (which I'm sure were also on the menu).",

Seemed to have mostly pork in it, which was really good though.  Can't wait to go back and try their hot pots!  Extreme yum-quotient here, so check it out ASAP!

    "text": "Joyful House is one of my favorite Chinese restaurants in town, and I come here quite often because of it's convenient hours (open til 3 am, I believe), and it's great food.  They have a large selection of live seafood to choose from, all coming from the tanks they have in the middle of the restaurant.  A sign acts as the menu with the prices for the fresh fish and seafood of the day.  They have different sized lobsters, crab, snapper, sea bass, and many others.  Seafood is not all they do well, though.    The Mongolian Beef is very good, as well as the Pork Chops with Salt & Pepper.  I also really like their Roasted Duck, which is a huge portion that serves a lot of people.  I usually try to come to Joyful House with a lot of people because their portions are large, making it a very affordable feast for lots of hungry people.    The prices are a about a dollar more per item than most Chinese restaurants in the area, but it's worth it with the quality of food you get from Joyful House.  The price might also be attributed to the nicer ambiance you get here.  The waiters are professionally dressed, and the decor is fancier than most places.  The tables are well set, and the plates and silverware are even of good quality.    If you're looking for a nice Chinese dinner with a lot of people, go to Joyful House.  Great food, great service, great restaurant!",

It was a couple miles from our hotel so I decided to check it out. This place is elegant but comfortable, you would be fine in casual wear. It is clean and the male host that met us at the door also waited on us and was very friendly and accommodating.  We ordered Mongolian Beef, Lemon Chicken, Yang Chow Fried Rice and Mustard Greens in Broth. We got our made to order food in less than 5 minutes and each dish was great.  The beef melted in my mouth; the Lemon Chicken was crispy on the outside and tender inside; and fried rice and the mustard green dish were both scrumptious. However, at $60.86 it may be a little pricey for some but it is worth it. Nevertheless. I am giving them 4 1/2 Yelp Stars.  I will definitely come back here when I am in Vegas again.",

Well, I discovered if you're not \"Chinese\" you can forget about it! I even asked them for soup and the waiter said,\"You never order!\". Whatever!  I did the ordering for 8 of us. I ordered deep fried flounder with garlic sauce (very good), orange chicken (for the kids), salt and pepper pork chop (soggy), fillet mignon w/ portabella mushrooms (salty and mushrooms was under cooked), beef chow fun (good), salty fish & chicken fried rice (cooked perfect), and snow peas and water chestnuts (not my favorite).  Our order arrived very quickly, but the serves were all stone faces. My mom whispers over, \"The waiters aren't very joyful\". That was classic. The wait staff receives a C- grade for blah service.  The food was tasty and extremly filling, but we did a great job putting it down. The flounder was on special for half price $20. My bill was $139 including tip, for feeding 8 people it was a win win situation.   The reason I gave them 3 out of five stars is, the food was over all good, and service was fast. They lacked in personality, friendliness, and they didn't bring us any complimentary soup and bean dessert. I seen the giving the other tables, but why not us? I give them one and a half thumbs up",

None of the duck I had in US can compare to the ones I had in Beijing, but the duck here is still on the lower end compare to the other US restaurants. It's not technically bad, but it's not very good either. The duck was very skinny, and the person that cut the skin for us did not know how to do it properly. I would pass if you are only here for the duck.   We also ordered the salt and pepper calamari and a seafood stone pot dish, calamari was really good, serving slightly small, and the seafood stone pot was somewhat bland but was made with quality ingredients.   Overall, it's a good place, and it will please different people. But I wouldn't crave anything from this place anytime soon.",

They tried to seat us directly in front of the entrance but were quite accommodating when we asked for a table more out of the way.    Prices are higher here, compared to your typical Chinese/HK style seafood restaurant.  Portions are skimpy...but the food sure tasted delicious!    We ordered 6 dishes plus a 1.5 order of the fish maw and crab meat soup which worked out perfectly for all of us.   Scallop w/ Snow Pea - taste was good but the scallops were scarce Salt/Pepper Pork Chops - good tasty, not-as-greasy version Salt/Pepper Flounder Filets - great batter, very light and airy...a big hit with our table Clay Pot shrimp pasted-stuffed tofu with eggplant - again, it worked out to 6 pieces of tofu and 5 pieces of eggplant.  but I could eat the sauce for days. Chinese broccoli sauteed in garlic - some of you know that Chinese broccoli can be old and tough.  But this dish used greens which turned out to be very tender and perfectly seasoned Clams in black bean sauce - probably the least remarkable of the dishes.  A number of the clams were cracked (did they drop them from high above into the wok???) and the sauce could have used a few more black beans.  Service was attentive, possibly because there were only 2-3 tables occupied by the time things got rolling for us.  The bus boy was on top of the tea and rice and our dishes came out long before our stomachs started roiling from hunger.  This was a great meal and helped to drive away the sting of losing at roulette...as well as the cold weather outside.",

    "text": "Food: 3 Service: 3  We came here because of Yelp reviews and photos other diners took. A caveat, we knew from previous reviews that this would be more \"Americanized\" Chinese than Yunnan Garden, where we ate an awesome meal last night.  But because we were bringing two non-Chinese friends with us, this was more in line with what they considered \"adventurous\" dining.  Our suspicions were confirmed when no chopsticks were present on the table or being used at any of the adjacent tables.     We ordered the salt and pepper scallops, steamed flounder, Mongolian beef, green beans with minced pork, and snow pea leaf with garlic.  The salt and pepper scallops were pretty good, with a reasonably crisply breading and very hot jalapenos topping them.  One of the two specials was the steamed flounder, and it was very well presented.  However, the fish was unevenly cooked with the lowest half inch of the fish under cooked to the point of still being somewhat gelatinous.  The Mongolian beef was salty and drowning in a gravy-like dark sauce.  The green beans were crisp with a decent amount of minced pork and snow pea leaf with garlic was cooked just right.  The veggies were definitely the best of the bunch.   Our first waiter was initially very helpful and filled our drink and food orders accurately.  After that, he checked on us twice to refill beers and sodas, and that was it.  The staff was mostly absent for the second half of our meal.   We had to try several times before finally flagging another waiter to get takeout containers and the check.  Unless we have other friends who have very conservative palates, we won't be going back.   There are too many better places.",

    "text": "As far as food is concerned it is good. As far as what we got for our reunion \"Chinese banquet\" dinner -- not so much. However, having said that, it is tough to organize a banquet for a large group and I felt we were jipped in price for what we got. I know if I went to the restaurant myself and ordered the same dishes, it would've cost much less.  Still, our dishes were good. We had:  Salt and pepper calamari -- your standard Chinese restaurant fare, good with tons of garlic  Fried veggie rolls -- I would've preferred these rolled in beancurd sheets, but what the hell  Shrimp with broccoli was nice, shrimp were plump, large and snappy.  Peking duck -- this was sad as there was a measly piece of duck in a huge bao   Black pepper steak with portabello mushrooms -- strange combination but what the hell, it was good  Steamed flounder -- okay I mean I order this dish often and it rarely runs more than $10-$12 a pop so don't sell it as something expensive PLEASE!  Stir fried green beans -- this was done really well with bits of preserved turnip greens in it. LOVED it.  Braised duck E-fu noodles -- okay, epic fail because these were not E-fu noodles. They looked and tasted more like regular egg noodles. I was so damn disappointed because I love E-fu noodles and these were not it.  At the end of the day, this meal did not constitute $50/head even with a few bottles of wine and beer thrown in. PUH-LEEZ! Only about 30% of the people had drinks. I think I was more upset that it was $50/head. I know if we had just gone in ourselves and ordered this menu, we would've easily walked away paying no more than $25/person tax and tip included.",

    "text": "After a long day of driving from Albuquerque and hitting stops all over Arizona, we finally make it to Vegas. At 23:00, not a lot of places off the strip were open, but fortunately Joyful House was there to help appease our hunger.  We were loopy, tired, and exhausted. So we quickly got to ordering here at this fairly large Cantonese seafood restaurant in Chinatown.  My friend and I decided to split three different dishes, all of which were about $12 for the plate for family style:  1. Crispy Fried Marinated Chicken - often served at Chinese banquets, this dish was pretty good with its thinly fried skin and white meat chicken. I thought it could've used a bit more flavor but it wasn't bad.  2. Crispy Salt Pepper Pork Chops - these are some of my favorite to order at Chinese restaurants and these were simply okay here at Joyful. Lacked a bit of punch.  3. Chinese Broccoli in Oyster Sauce - great veggie selection with drizzled hoisin right on top. You really can't go wrong with this option.  At $12 a plate, it is a bit pricy compared to most other Chinese restaurants I've been to. The only exception would be the chicken, but given that it was only a decent meal, I probably wouldn't necessarily come back unless they really amped up the flavor in their food.  If you are craving Chinese and just need a late night option that works, then Joyful can certainly be your spot.",

I ordered 3 entrees and all 3 were much smaller than what I'm normally used to at other places. Usually a large chow mein feeds about 4 people. The large chow mein from here wasn't even enough for three. There were only 2 shrimps in the chow mein. Also, the order was very expensive compared to other places. The cashier was not friendly at all. He didn't even say \"you're welcome\" after I thanked him after paying when picking up my order.  I decided to give it another try about a week later thinking maybe it was just a bad experience the first time. I placed the same order and received the same small portions and unfriendly service. I'm guessing 2 shrimps in a large chow mein, serving portions half the size of other places, very high prices, and unfriendly service is standard here. I will not be returning.",

He was familiar with this restaurant and as I've never been - insisted this be one of our stops.   The restaurant is pretty spacious and clean! We were seated right after walking in and served tea and waters. We wanted light seafood and went with the following:   - Salt and Pepper Shrimp Whole shrimp with the head and shell still on. Simple in flavor but very tasty! My friend would just pop the whole shrimp in his mouth but I prefer to peel and de-head mine. I was convinced to try one whole after staring at its eyes for a good while. I came to the conclusion that I would still prefer peeling mine   - Steamed Oysters in Black Bean Sauce Oh. My. Goodness. No words for how bomb these oysters were. We got 4 total and they were doused in a black bean sauce, topped with scallions, a ton of minced garlic (I love garlic), and cilantro. The oysters were so full of flavor and incredibly enjoyable. I've never tasted oysters prepared like this before (I usually order oysters raw) and could easily devour a half dozen of these!  - Spicy Manila Clams  We had a sizzling hot pot come out with clams and veggies in a flavorful sauce/broth. It was a little spicy but the heat wasn't overpowering. I personally love clams so I easily helped devour our hot pot   I thought the seafood dishes here were great. I love Sichuan Chinese food but I also enjoy and appreciate Cantonese style Chinese food. Tasty Chinese cuisine and no complaints about the service. If you decide to check out Joyful House I highly recommend the steamed oysters in black bean sauce!",

The Dim Sum brunch at the Wynn was $68.00 per person before tax and gratuity; Dumplings really, give me a break. On the other hand, lots of people actually live in Las Vegas and they can't afford those prices; we choose to eat Chinese food where the locals eat and it was magnificent. One such place is located in the Las Vegas Chinatown, a mile or so off the Strip.  Joyful House was featured on the Food Network for having the Second-best Chinese dish in the country. We had a delightful dinner. We started with the Hot and Sour Soup and steamed dumplings. For our main course we had the Honey Shrimp (the award winner) and Singapore noodles. We had some Sake. The price was very reasonable and the Uber ride to and from the hotel was modest.  When you find yourself in a tourist mecca, often the best food is a few miles from the main attraction. Locals know how to eat well and for cheap. They have to live there.",

Especially in a town that lacks authentic Chinese food, and that's saying a lot coming from someone who lives right around the corner of \"Chinatown\"..  Best part? For me anyways, it's that they are open late! (3am) for all the night owls like me, that is perfect!   When I'm in the mood for Chinese and not in the mood to look for a \"new\" place (because it can be a hit or miss with some places), I can definitely count on the Joyful house to do the job! Lol  I've had the pleasure of dining in and ordering takeout plenty of times. They do not disappoint! I have never had a bad meal here.. they have a wide selection, huge menu! I've tried quite a few dishes from here and everything has been delicious! From their fried rice to the live seafood, you will definitely enjoy.  Please do not order your basic Chinese dishes and then complain that it's \"overpriced\", definitely try out their specialty dishes. They always have specials going on. And for the quantity, quality and let's not forget their service the price is more than reasonable.  Do not let the exterior fool you, once you walk inside you'll definitely feel like you're a bit underdressed, which is fine if you don't mind.. it has an upscale vibe, the waiters are in suits/vests and they are very attentive!  Great place for the whole family.",

    "text": "What can I say at this point about this place. It's been almost over 3 years I haven't been to this location Becuase of it's really expensive entrees they serve here that aren't worth the price. I heard they are under new management and it was a family day to eat out. I came in and the place has been remodeled from before.  Brand new menu items and beverages I never seen. I ordered the Thai tea boba and it's it was just drenched in mostly ice. The tapioca pearl was just overly cooked. Our list of items we order:  1. Salt & pepper calamari: 5/10- small portion and barely seasoned with salt and Pepper. 2. Bokchoy & mushroom: 7/10- huge portion and great entree as a side dish. 3. Whole duck: 10/10- very huge portion for about $24, can feed up to five people and we'll crisp with juicy flavors, definetly worth it. 4. Fish maw soup: 8/10- serving for 3 people. Must add some soy sauce for more flavors. Really liked it.   Not much to complain about this place it's just a little disappointing with their prices but the whole duck made up for my visit here. Had some leftovers for me to to take home and enjoy for dinner.",

The lunch specials come with sweet corn soup -  not bad, egg rolls - greasy and bland, fried rice - greasy and bland and tea. The main chicken courses were also greasy and bland, dumbed down, I think, for the laowai among us.   Much better and more authentic Chinese in Chinatown in Vegas. Try Yunnan Garden, for instance.

    "text": "I remember coming here years back when they used to be in a different location (I think, can't remember that far back...).  I also remember that it was quite good, although I again cannot remember at all what I had.  I'm sure they were fairly typical dishes such as mushu or kung pao or something.  Recalling that they were good and being in the mood for Chinese, we made our way here for lunch.  First of all, no lunch menu on weekends.  We got the menu of dozen pages or so that were just normal dinner dishes - fairly expensive dishes.  Fortunately we were not looking for a lunch menu and wanted the full gamut so it didn't faze us any, but be prepared that it will not be a cheap lunch.  The menu you do get is upscale in both the menu itself and the contents with right balances of seafood and non-seafood.    I was craving some Chinese seafood so we ordered the Seafood Wor Wonton Soup ($10), marinated spicy clams ($14), and sweet & sour crispy rock cod fish ($14).  The soup had plenty of fat wontons and ample amount of seafood, and with the large size it's well worth the price.  Spicy clams were in deep red, spicy sauce, with a hint of mala tingliness.  Loved it.  The sweet & sour was not too sweet, not too sour, with perfectly fried fish that was as tender as can be.  As good as the first two were, this was even better.  With enough unusual items on the menu, this may very well be our go-to Chinese.  Our meal came to $50 after all was said and done, but it was the best Chinese we've had in a long, long time.  Service was more pleasant than the typical Chinese restaurants, although it's all relative.  Food came fast, restaurant is clean, and traffic was brisk.  I'm torn between 4 & 5-stars, but let's leave it at 4 until I revisit.  It's really 4.5 stars.  Table-for-1 Factor:  Despite the large table-centric set up, I think the atmosphere might actually work for 1.  Maybe.",

TWO appetizers, choice of over 10 entrees and pork fried rice OR steamed rice.  WOW.  We had salt & pepper shrimp one day, duck is even a choice which I got the second time and then the spicy beef.  OH my goodness.  All for $9.75..  For dinners, we've had the Chow Fun Beef with wide rice noodles...to die for, Salt & pepper fish, Mongolian Beef,  seasoned Chinese cabbage, too many good ones to remember. It's no wonder this is a top 50 in THE USA Chinese, clean, ambient decor, and attentive servers. MUST GO there!",

    "text": "Our foray into Chinatown - unbelievably the first in our 9-year history in Las Vegas - started out a bit rocky, but was quickly transformed into a wonderful dining experience.  After the initial kinks were knocked out, the food won out, as did some hands-on attention by Gary, the manager/(owner?).  I can understand why the guy sitting next to me on the plane last week heartily recommended Joyful House.  We started with Hot and Sour soup, at first dismayed by the price, but after hubby had four bowls (to my 2 1/2), the quantity and quality made up for it:  it's gotta be the best Hot and Sour in the Valley!  We shared a Chicken & Portobello Mushroom, also delicious, and also a String Bean with Minced Pork that would have been fabulous if I had only remembered to ask for \"no extra salt.\"  Gary offered to remake the dish, but we kept it, since it was really good despite my anti-salt crusade.    For us, the hallmark of a good restaurant is being made to feel welcomed and appreciated.  If not, it doesn't matter how good the food is.  Joyful House wins on both counts, and we look forward to returning soon.",

The service was good as our waiter made some good recommendations and the plates were constantly being taken away and drinks refilled.  But the food was just too pricey.  Every dish was close to $20 if not more.  And the portions seemed smaller than average -- we had to order two of most dishes.  If you have a large party, you may want to consider it.",

As soon as we walked in we were seated very quickly with menus and hot tea. At the start of the menu there is 3 dinner servings with a easy simple courses if you don't want to think to hard or simply are not sure what you want.  I selected the number 1 serving. With soup, massive plate fried rice and another plate with noodles. I can't 100% tell you what was in all the dishes but I can tell you they were pretty good with a decent serving.  Joyful house has a great seafood selection with a lot of  live crabs and lobsters swimming in the tanks on the rear wall. Although a speciality I didn't get to try any. But with other yelpers reviews it shows that it maybe something worth coming back to.  The decor of Joyful isn't a 5 star restaurant that you would find in a fancy strip casino, but what it does bring to the table is good food and prompt service.

They never brought one of the dishes we ordered, and one that we did receive had extra ingredients that weren't pictured in the menu. We left those with the dishes. Stars are for food and facility. The two-minute drink service after being seated didn't apply here.",

Its not the food was bad it just didnt blow me away,I find myself comparing everything to what i am used to and unfortunately it falling woefully short. The potstickers were super weak,I mean worse then supermarket frozen weak. The BBQ pork fried rice needed flavoring and was a bit on the dry side. The shrimp in lobster sauce was average. The kung po chicken was ok,and the best dish was the mongolian beef a bit of sweet and hot flavor,pretty tasty. All in all it was another just ok experience,my search continues :)",

Since it was a private event, we made sure the restaurant was all ours. They catered to all of our needs Twenty something years later, we went back this time for our dad's  80 birthday. Their friendly service did not changed. This eatery host a variety of traditional Chinese and seafood dishes. The flavors of all the dishes that we ordered were spot on. I was impressed by their food and looking forward to try other dishes on their menu next time I'm in Las Vegas. I recommend if you are in a mood for authentic Chinese food, head over to this eatery. Their wait time could be 30 minutes long but worth the wait. You will leave with a full stomach and a joyful smile.",

Our group ordered four different lunch specials, the roast duck, cashew chicken, sweet and sour chicken, and spicy beef.  The roast duck was super dry, and no one liked the cashew chicken because it was bland. The sweet and sour chicken and the spicy beef or the best out of the four.  The spicy beef and sweet sour chicken had great flavor and didn't have a lot of fat. Oh and I forgot to mention the lunch special also comes with a free beverage of iced tea or soda. A win-win for lunch specials. If all the dishes were great I would have given this place 5 stars but since half of the dishes were okay and the others or not I'm giving this place 3 1/2 stars.",

A gentlemen stopped by with some hot tea for us to start with. We sat for about 10 minutes and no one came by to offer beverages or take our order so i walked to counter to let someone know and finally the server spotted me walking over and immediately rushed over. As i re-sat i quickly skimmed through our order with salt and pepper shrimp, beef broccoli, half order of crispy duck, pork chow funn and steamed rice.  The server apologized and said he would rush our food out and boy he did. We got everything with 10 minutes of ordering. Talk about speed.  Everything had great taste to it and were all cooked perfect except for the beef in the beef broccoli some pieces were a little red in the middle when bitten through. Overall i gave this place 3 stars for the lack of service in beginning. We would give this place another try.",

    "text": "Every time I visit my parents living in So Cal, I make it a point to take them to Vegas as they are getting older and seldom get to go. Invariably, they looked forward to having a meal at Joyful House ever since I took them there maybe 7 or 8 years ago after reading glowing reviews on Yelp and after hearing my sister, who goes to Vegas often for work, talk about how good their food was.  For the first 3 or 4 times we visited over the years, we've always talked up the flavors, quality ingredients, and good service, even if the prices are not the cheapest. We would normally order their Green beans in XO sauce, salt and pepper tofu and another dish...and we would normally come away full and satiated after a very good meal. Well, I don't know what changed but the flavors and the experience aren't quite the same.  On a recent visit, my wife and I took my parents to Vegas and our first stop, even before checking into our hotel room, was Joyful House. It was a late lunch so we were a bit hungry after a three-hour drive from So Cal. We ordered wonton soup for my wife and the rest of us shared Egg flower soup. We also ordered the Crispy Fried Salt and Pepper Calamari as an appetizer. For main entrees, we ordered Beef and Broccoli, 1/2 Crispy Fried House Chicken and String beans with XO sauce.  The wonton soup was disappointing with watered down broth that lacked flavor and wontons that were chewy. The egg flower soup was just OK. The crispy calamari was good, crispy exterior with a tender, not chewy interior. While the string beans with XO sauce were as good as we've come to expect, the fried chicken was just OK and the beef and broccoli was another disappointment.  All in all, a disappointing meal that will make us rethink our \"go to\" Chinese restaurant for our Vegas visits.  Late lunch for 4 came out to just over $96 with tip...for an uninspired, disappointing and pricy meal.",

    "text": "Was looking for a Chinese restaurant in Vegas that would provide a delectable Chinese dinner banquet menu in a comfortable setting to equal the special occasion.  The website of Joyful captured my attention but the menu selection seemed limited which prompted me to email the restaurant.  The person at Joyful was very helpful and emailed me their complete menu.  After a few email exchanges, we were able to come up with a dinner menu and pricing for eight people.  The dinner menu was: 1. Small House Combination Barbecue Platter 2. Winter Melon Soup 3. Steam Whole Flounder  4. Imperial Peking Duck (crepes)  5. Steam Chicken with Mustard Green 6. Pan Fried String Beans with XO Sauce 7. Baby Bok Choy with Oyster Mushroom 8. Live Maine Lobster in Savory Broth with Efu Noodles  The dinner was quite good for a Cantonese restaurant in Las Vegas.  The content of the wintermelon soup was not exactly as pictured on the website menu, though agreed the soup would not be presented in the cavity of the wintermelon.  There was a generous serving of wintermelon with a tasty broth.  The serving proportions more than adequately satisfied my dinner guests.  They enjoyed each dish especially the steam whole flounder, Peking duck, steamed chicken and Maine lobster with noodles.  We had our own private table in the corner away from the smaller tables that made our dinner experience more comfortable with little noise intrusion.  Service was excellent and too efficient as I would have preferred a bit more time enjoying the soup followed by the combination barbecue platter separately before having all the other dishes brought out at once.  The fish was timed perfectly and did not immediately come out with the other dishes but afterwards.  It was an enjoyable evening with good friends and good food in a quiet setting.",

We arrived around 5:30 or so and were seated immediately.  Our server came over within 2-3 minutes to ask what we would like to drink and if we wanted water. The drinks and water were returned almost immediately as well as a hot pot of delicious tea. Our waiter was very helpful in choosing our dishes. However, the portions are way too large to be shared by just two people and should be considered food for four, especially is you plan on trying several dishes. We started with pot stickers and they were simply outstanding. We did not realize the dinner was served with a large bowl of steamed rice and ordered combination fried rice, which was excellent, but not necessary. Based on another review we tried the Walnut Prawns which were simply outstanding. We also had Sweet and Sour Pork as out second dish. Way too much food for two people so guess what we are having for lunch today. Next time we will wither go with four people or order a little less food. Initially, prices seemed high, but when we saw the amount of food it was well worth the price. We have started a folder of restaurants we have enjoyed and keep a copy of the menu in there for future reference. Needless to say Joyful House menu has been added. This is definitely a keeper!",

    "text": "My coworker swears by this place for their authentic cantonese cuisine.  We went there after work one night for some late night grub.  It's a very nice restaurant in chinatown complete with live fish, prawns, lobster, and crabs.  We went for takeout so we couldn't really judge the service but the guy that seats you was really nice and helpful.  My coworker recommended the salt and pepper pork chops.  Since I had always been told by my ever-so-seasoned fellow yelper/coworker reggie to always order salt and pepper anything whenever I can, I agreed to try said pork chops.  After about a 15 minute wait, the waiter brought out our food.  It smelled great and I couldn't wait to get home to try it.  I opened up the to-go box and there were small breaded pork chops (some with bone, some without) that had bits of garlic and jalepeno all throughout the dish.  It came with rice as well.  When I dug in I couldn't believe how tender they were.  These pork chops just melted away in my mouth.  The contrast of the jalepeno against the pork was incredible with just the right amount of heat and saltiness.  All in all it was a great dish and I would definitely go back.  They had a lobster sale while we were there...19.95/lb down from 29.95/lb and these things were monsters!  Anyways, check this place out...it's great for late night eats.",

I didn't order or choose what dishes we were going to have that night, but perhaps, if i ordered things that were more my style, it would be better?. Service was pretty good probably because we had 1lobster and 1 fish per table. I dunno the price but, 15/20 bucks per seafood entree multiply by 3 = a lot of money + tips. LOL",

Joyful house is open late. We ordered salt and pepper shrimp with the skin on. A must try the shrimp were fried enough to make the skin crisp and you old eat it in one bite. Fantastic flavor. Salted fish in clay pot was a also a good choice. The tofu was tender and the fish slightly tender. The chicken and black bean sauce was good but was probably the weakest dish that we ordered from a flavor perspective. Not a spicy as they say it is. We also ordered fried Singaporean style noodles with seafood. Noodles were slightly crispy and the fish topping very tasty. Excellent place for quick, reasonable late night dinner. Decor is to be expected uninspiring and rather dated but you don't go there for the people or the atmosphere but for the food.",

I don't want mushrooms, chicken and broccoli, I want chicken and broccoli. So I thought I would be smart and ask whether or not it had mushrooms before I ordered it. He said no, reassuring me that there wasn't and then asked me if I wanted American broccoli or Chinese broccoli. I thought all broccoli was the same, but silly me. So I said American, being safe.

From glowing reviews, I was stoked about a great seafood meal, perhaps like I had while living in China for 10 years.  Pity.  No such luck.  The char su (bbq pork) was lean, alright, but chewy like jerky.  And cold.  Noodles were served immediately, when any self-respecting Chinese restaurant owner knows that the \"pasta is served at the end!\"  At least along side the steamed fish.  Pacing is critical in a good Chinese restaurant with courses arriving at appropriate intervals.  The 'highly recommended' shrimp dish was laden with red sauce.  Very Midwestern and sweet - with all due respect to my Midwestern friends, whose steak and pizza I adore.  In a word, \"Fake\".  And not cheap!  It may be worth a second try, but I may venture to other places along Spring Mountain to find a great kitchen.  Not the best way to begin the Year of the Rabbit.  Now that's a dish served well and spicy in Beijing.",

They must have a buffet or something at night since I see the layout against the fish tanks but I always order from the menu.  The menu does have a mixture of what I like to call Real Chinese and American Chinese dishes so it will appeal to those who order egg rolls and pork fried rice (you know who you are) and those of us who do not.    I minus one star for the fact that the bathrooms are sketchy and dirty bathrooms at restaurants freak me out because I wonder what the kitchen looks like.",

I love everything that my friends and I have ever ordered here.    The reason I gave it 5 stars is because they have good service and it's clean but still have that legitimate Chinese food.

I was the lucky one today to get the last catch of the day! Lol i meant the duck. The staff are very attentive too and its about 10 mins drive away from the strip. So if your using a cab to get there make sure have the address ready from yelp to let the cab drive know too since they all arent familar with the restaurants off the strip.

What was uttered represented a grunt at best.  And like with too many Chinese restaurants, do not expect the server to return to check after serving your dishes.  The only person who communicated and provided some positive attention was the non-Asian bus boy, or maybe he was a waiter-in-training.    It was a quiet night so several waiters stood a few feet from our table surveying the empty tables.  Guess they had nothing else to do; they stared at times and never said a word or cracked a smile.    They should remove the \"Joyful\" name from their business and replace with \"Me-No-Smile Chinese Restaurant.\"  If hungry for Chinese food in Las Vegas, give them a try; just do not expect a \"Joyful\" atmosphere, because that's False advertising!  Will I go back again if in LV?  Maybe.......food was tasty.",

    "text": "****MAKE SURE JOYFUL HOUSE IS YOUR ASIAN 10 COURSE WEDDING BANQUET CATERER****  Have you ever wanted a 10 course Asian banquet for a wedding for 125 guests?  You have 2 options: 1) Choose to have the wedding at an Asian restaurant, where you are limited with the restaurant capacity and limited floor space for dancing or 2) Find a restaurant to cater the Asian food in the venue of your choice.    I selected option 2.  I went to several Asian restaurants to see if they had the capacity to perform the duties.  Most of the Asian restaurants in Las Vegas were very poor on communication and none of them would return my phone calls even after constant reminders of having their restaurant provide me a quote list of the dinner items and an agenda on how they will be able to perform the function.  All of them failed miserably on the capacity test except for Joyful House.  Joyful House was the ONLY restaurant that had the means to cater in the food.     They have 2 very helpful managers willing to provide constant communication to make sure your Asian catering and wedding event is a success.  High 5's to both Dell and Stanley.  They are truly amazing and made my wedding planning so easy.    Here is why:  1) They are extremely good at constant communication.  I am ABC, so they speak good English. 2) Planning - I would give them a 100 out of 10 in terms of their planning skills.  Chef Yau, Dell and Stanley went to Havana Room at the Tropicana Hotel and met with the Director of Catering.  They laid out the entire inventory items of plates, forks, dinner platters, etc.  They make things look so smooth, yet there were so many complexities in performing the catering job.  Joyful House brought in all the raw materials, tea cups, tea pots, soy sauce, etc. and cooked everything fresh in Tropicana's kitchen.   3)Food Quality - I would give them a 100 out of 10.  We had a lot of Asian food connoisseur's in our guest list and I got nothing but raving reviews.  There is a reason why CNN ranked Joyful House as Top 50!  Their specialty is Honey Walnut Shrimp.  My guests were extremely happy about all of the food quality.  Joyful House delivered above and beyond on their quality of food.  The food was so darn good that my guests kept asking for more food than what I originally ordered.    I can't thank Joyful House for doing such an amazing job!  Thank you again!",

I think the average entree was about $10-11, with large sharing portions.  Everything was cooked well and it's one of the better Chinese restaurants in town IMO.  Here is a pic of everything we ordered :  <a href=\"http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/joyful-house-chinese-cuisine-las-vegas?userid=eZZyuJDouIg4p-GYB3PV_A#GAN-B1GGaFvLw0tAS5zyuQ\">yelp.com/biz_photos/joyf...</a>  We tried their salt and pepper shrimp (shells), which were cooked perfectly and had a great flavor.  One of the better ways I've had it.  Tried the salt and pepper pork since everyone was saying great things about it....it was also very good!  Nice crispy pieces of pork with a light breading around it.  It had lots of flavor and a little spice to back it up.  The half duck was good and flavorful.  I haven't had duck for a little while, so it really hit the spot.  We tried the garlic eggplant, which was good, but a little mushy for me.  The flavor was there, just not my favorite way to eat eggplant.  They are open very late, 3am every night, so this will really hit the spot for late night cravings!",

Thank goodness I found this place.  I ordered the roast duck, Chinese broccoli, mandarin style pork chops, and salt & pepper shrimp.  The salt & pepper shrimp was awesome.  Probably one of the best shrimp dishes I've had.  The rest was ok.  It wasn't nearly as good as the Asian cuisine found back in Cali, but the best in Vegas so far.  I will gladly drive the half hour to eat there.  I took off one star because of the price.Thanks yelpers for this find.  :)",

My husband had the chicken chow fun with black bean sauce and that was ok. He said he would not order it again because it lacked the smoky flavor that other Chinese restaurants have in their chow fun. The Chinese broccoli was a little aged so some of it was stringy and towards the end there were a few pieces that were gritty.  I would definitely come back here for the salt and pepper anything.",

For this latest visit, it was a family affair. I don't know how weird this sounds. For I, upon walking into Joyful House, the ambiance feels like how I'm used to a chinese restaurant feeling like. I will admit the food is slightly pricier here. To be fair, the food is, for the most part, decent to very good. They do serve complimentary jasmine rice, which not every place would have. Jasmine is very fragrant and less starchy than say, a long grain calrose. It does cost more and better, at least I think so. Along with complimentary hot tea. Even though most chinese restaurants serve these 2 items complimentary, it is worth mentioning since I am aware some places charge for them. Service overall has been ok. Everyone is very friendly and helpful. There seems to be a lag sometimes when it gets real busy to get something or having water or hot tea refilled. And believe me, this place does get busy! I give Joyful House a solid 3.5 stars.",

It's not the best I've had, but it is solid and specially when it comes to late night where most places go downhill in quality, I appreciate that it's consistent. We just get off of work, we're not drunk so we actually care what food tastes like.  They have stuff that serves more for a friendly palette but they also have legit dishes too and have tried quite a few of those are are indeed, authentic and want to note in particular that the seafood is fresh and fairly priced. Servers are pretty friendly here too, specially since the late night crew are the same, they are familiar with us and are attentive on the drinks refills  It's a good standby for late night eats.

    "text": "Amazing! I had been looking for a great Chinese place in town, and randomly stumbled upon Joyful House.  I had the Half Shell Steamed Oysters with Black Bean sauce, which were absolutely fantastic and fresh. The delivery person arrived there after we had been told they were out of oysters, so these were very very fresh.   I also had the Crispy Fried Tofu stuffed w/ Shrimp Paste. It came with slices of eggplant as well - and the whole thing was delicious.   To top it all off, we added some chicken fried rice. My expectations with fried rice are pretty basic, and this easily met those. Fried rice is basically fried rice....it's fairly easy for a good Chinese restaurant to not screw this up.  I was pleasantly surprised by their extensive wine menu. I didn't happen to order a $1,500+ bottle of Petrus nor Lafite, but it was nice to see that was an option. ;)  For those of us who aren't on CEO incomes, they had plenty to choose from, and I opted for a $9/glass Merlot.  Total cost for two people - those three dishes and a glass of wine - was about $40. Bottom line: incredible food, friendly service, and a definite place for repeat visits.",

Did not taste like mignon beef.  I had to cut the pieces of beef into smaller pieces to make it less chewy.  The satay sauce was not spicy and very salty.  Mapo tofu tasted too sour.  It had way too much pickled peppers and not enough spice.  The consistency was also thick and almost slime-like.  Crispy pan fried noodle with beef was ok.  The beef texture was almost the same as the mignon beef, but just a little thinner.  It also tasted like they cooked it in a pan that they had just cooked something with seafood in it and did not wash the pan.   The servers were nice and friendly.  Just wished the food matched their service.",

    "text": "I chop yo chicken!!! I chop yo chicken into small chunks. I don't mince yo chicken.... I just chop into tiny juicy pieces. This is the reason why the egg drop soup with minced chicken didn't suck. Unlike Most restaurants which tend to abuse their chicken (Capitol Seafood), Joyful did chicken right like your gams gams making homemade chicken soup. But not everybody is your gam gams, and most tend to abuse their chicken because chicken is so lean it leads to dry bland chicken bits that you will choke on (I just wanted to put \"choke\" and \"chicken\" in the same sentence).  The spicy and probably sour shrimp was decent, but not stellar although they did do a stand-up job on prepping those on-yerns (onions) which was sliced thinly - most Chinese restaurants will just quarter the onions.... slackers!  Also ordered the tau miu which was your standard garlic pea shoot vegetable dish. Nothing like your leafy green vegetables to keep you \"regular\"... this might be good for you, if you're one of those people that disappear for an hour or so with a magazine under your arm. FYI - I'm in'n'out in record time... the secret is \"leafy greens\".  The last dish was some beef dish with a generic indistinctive flavor. That's why I'll generically just say it was \"decent\".  The reason why I tried this place out, is because I can't stand getting screwed with all the high priced, hyped up crap on the strip. Instead, I like my \"crap\" off the strip.... speaking of crap, those leafy greens I had earlier is working their magic.",

Unlike other lunch specials they bring you family style plates of your entree so you are able to share which we thought was really nice.   The entree's were delicious, one of the best chicken chow miens I have ever had and I don't usually like chow mien, the beef slices were large and tender and the chicken held its crunch in the sweet and sour sauce the service was also very good.   My only disappointment was the pork fried rice that came with the lunch special it was flavorless and mushy.   I would definitely go there again but will opt for the steamed rice next time.",

We were greeted and seated by a nice lady, maybe a manager. But our waitress was far from friendly, never cracked a smile once. I ordered the fish special, a deep fried flounder. And that is what I got. A good size fish with head and tail, deep fried. No veggies or sides. We also ordered the Manila Clams which were very good. It is a dish that can be eaten as a soup but were not given smaller soup bowls or soup spoons. The waitress seemed irritated when we asked for the bowls and spoons. We also ordered the seafood special Hong Kong noodle dish. The noodles are supposed to be fried crispy and the sauce and seafood poured over the crispy noodles. Our noodles were only crispy along the very edge of the dish. The rest were soft and not what Hong Kong noodles are supposed to be. We asked for chopsticks for the noodles. Again the waitress seemed irritated when asked for chopsticks. The table setting was one napkin and one fork. If you want chopsticks you had to ask. Service was very poor, slow, and unfriendly. It wasn't that they were busy. There was only one other couple there besides us. Prices were a little more expensive compared to similar Chinese Restaurants along Spring Mountain.",

    "text": "On a recent trip my boys and I had a \"ChinAtkinese\" diet here at Joyful House.  We ordered the salt and pepper pork chops, honey walnut shrimp, and sizzlin beef in satay sauce.   My favorite dish was the Honey Walnut Shrimp.  I was delighted to see more shrimp than almonds; however, the dish was small in size overall.  The sweetness originated from the honey (of course), a dash of sugar or brown sugar, and a hint of coconut milk.  The pepper pork chops were tender with a small spicy kick to it.  The sizzlin beef was okay.  Even though the plates were small we were actually satisfied but not totally full.    The service was Americanized compared to a typical Chinese restaurant.  Everyone working was fluent in English.  Our food was delivered fast as well.",

It looked decent at first, but once I dug in it was fatty, tough and grizzly. I've never had to work so hard to get to the meat before. Our waiter came by and asked how we were doing, I mentioned that the duck was very difficult to eat. He brought me wet naps. It was appreciated, but a knife might have been more helpful.

We had the Chilean sea bass steamed with black bean sauce as well as the Kung pao chicken and a corn chowder soup with chopped chicken. The sea bass was melt in your mouth, buttery goodness. There were small bones in it, however, so beware. The Kung pao was amazing too. Both were served with rice and we sipped on their jasmine tea. It was PACKED so call ahead like we did. A+++!",

    "text": "This place is definitely my favorite Chinese Restaurant in Las Vegas. Hands down. Every time I have friends in town and they want to eat good off the strip Chinese food, this is place we go. Its open around lunch time and closes super late, 11am-3am. When I first walked into this place, I saw a good sign. Tons and tons of other Asian families eating here. The menu is pretty extensive and also has pictures for the newbies.  We ordered: Salt and Pepper Pork Chops, Pan Fried Sea Bass, Roast Duck, Salt and Pepper Sea Bass, Spicy String Beans with Chicken, Garlic Ong Choy, and some Oyster Clay Pot.  Wow. I was definitely amazed by the taste and quality of the food. The Salt and Pepper Pork Chops are definitely different from the other restaurants. Instead of battering the pork and deep frying it, they do it in a way that the batter isn't fried in. Its like a separate layer above the meat so you can taste both parts when you bite into it. Its weird to explain but its good. So good, that we order it every time we go there.   The Pan Fried Sea Bass is my absolute favorite. The lightly fried sea bass comes swimming in sweet soy sauce but it doesn't overpower the taste nor the light crisp. Definitely a must order.  The Roast Duck here is waaaaaay better than at Sam Woo BBQ. The dish here actually has large chunks of meat. It has a right combination of crispy skin and meaty meat. That's the way this dish should be served.  The Salt and Pepper Sea Bass was good but not a must have. The Spicy String Beans with Pork was good also.... But not a must have. I would probably order other dishes the next time I'm here.  The Oyster Clay Pot was surprisingly filled with..... Lots of oysters! It comes with roast port, fried tofu, and lots of oysters. Definitely a must have if you like this kind of dish.  Last but not least, the Garlic Ong Choy is one of my favorite veggie dishes. It was cooked perfectly. The leafy part was soft, yet not overcooked, and the stems were slightly crunchy in texture.  This place is great. I highly recommended it. Funny thing is when I ask my coworkers where they go to get good Chinese food, they always say Joyful House. I felt like I was the last one in on this wonderful secret. I've been back here at least 5 times since I first discovered it. Its that good.  As always, pictures are included! Yummy!",

The shrimp wonton soup has great hong kong style flavor, the noodles are al dente, and the wontons are shrimpy and delicious. The server comes to the table to serve and portion the noodles and wonton for each person on the table (they keep it fair whenever possible).   On another occasion, I came in with my mom and she noted how good and flavorful the white rice was. I don't really eat white rice much, but apparently it's a big deal to traditional Chinese folk. I think they think if the restaurant can't get the rice right, then what does that say about the rest of their food.   Since moving out here, I miss my mom's soups/elixers and to get a taste of home, I like to order their house soup. This is on the menu but it's usually some traditional soup that Chinese families cook at home. Nothing like Egg drop, Westlake or Hot and Sour soup. It's usually a combination of chicken and pork broth based with herbs and vegetables. Generally it's good for your body or health, but it depends on which soup.   It is a little pricier than some of the more casual Chines restaurants but it shows in the quality of ingredients.",

With white linens and waiters dressed in suits, it's got an upscale vibe. But, most of the customers seemed to be dressed as casually as me.   Their menu is massive. It's a large book full of items that will satisfy those looking for authentic fare and those looking for Chinese-American food -- the kind you can get from any corner take out spot.  Kung pao chicken was heavy on sauce, but a decent portion size with plenty of chicken, green peppers and nuts. Shrimp fried rice was light on ingredients (other than rice) but the flavors were solid. If you're a fan of bok choy, the mushroom and bok choy dish had just enough sauce to let the ingredients shine while enhancing their flavors. My favorite dish of the night was the tender, well seasoned beef in oyster sauce with green onions. I loved the flavors of the sauteed green beans, too with it's subtle use of heat and minimal amounts of oil. If fish is your thing, try the seabass. Flakey and delicate, it was a well executed dish with a light buttery flavor. Not as successful was the house fried half chicken. The skin was perfectly wafer thin and crispy, but the meat was bland and dry as a bone.  Perfect for large parties, it's also great for families. Kids will love the aquariums full of crabs, lobsters and other future meals.",

Yummy noodles, although they were a tiny bit too greasy, and finally a place that serves Sesame Chicken! That was certainly delicious. The server was friendly, though his English was somewhat limited. They also brought a pot of tea to the table, I guess it was complementary because they didn't charge for it, and the table settings already had tea cups at them. And it was very good, although I couldn't tell exactly what kind of tea it was. Had it been morning or day time, I would have said the tea was a little weak, but being the hour that it was, it was perfect. Boyfriend doesn't drink tea, so I had the whole pot to myself! I just wish the teapot had been easier to pour from, as it dribbled every time.  Overall great experience, we will be back!",

There are also numerous Chinese  dishes that are not available in most Chinese restaurants. My favorite is honey walnut shrimp.  Everything is brought to the table and set on a revolving tray so everyone can dig in and eat. Among the dishes we shared was Mongolian Beef, by far the best I have ever eaten.

We ordered the salt and pepper pork chops, honey walnut shrimp, and sizzlin beef.  The honey shrimp was ok, my friend makes it better, maybe because she drizzles it with the sauce.  The same goes with the sizzlin beef, nothing to oh ah after.  This was recommended by our server.  It was tasty but nothing orgasmic.  My favorite were the chops, as they were juicy and tender!  It was seasoned and cooked perfectly for my taste buds.  Serving size were small as we ended up going to In-N-Out a few hours later.  Service was excellent and our food came out rather quick, like within 10 minutes from placing our order.",

I remember this place as being one of my mom's friends favorite places and I have been here before a long time ago.  We ordered a chicken to split and it was amazing, we also ordered the eggplant which was very good as well..  This place seems to be keeping up its reputation of good food, the service was a little slow which was surprising being it was past the lunch hour and there were not a lot of people in there.  I recommend this place as they have a good variety on the menu to suit anyones appetite.",

    "text": "So, in the car with fellow yelper Trev W. and were in China town looking for a place we haven't been.     I suggest to \"just pick any place...    I'm sure it will either be Awesome or it will at least be a story\"...       Now the sound of screeching tires...   a wild left turn from the right lane and we were there...    at Joyful House.  Once we thanked the gods that we were still alive...  we checked the yelp reviews...      a lot of them... and a really good average.  Alright, looking forward to this.  So the place is kinda what I was hoping for...     something that didn't look like a high over-head \"Asian Fusion\" type place like PF Changs (all do respect to PF...   I do love the Mongolian beef)...   it's simple and to the point...    kinda like a dinner.  Think denny's.   We got seated right away and menus came out to us...   we started looking at stuff but noticed that on the first page were three combo set dinner options...   we made it easy and ordered option 1...( We are not picky...  no food allergies...     we were just hungry)  Oh My God...    Come HUNGRY  Out comes tea...     that's cool...   then a very large bowl of soup...Sooooo tasty.     Next egg rolls, dumplings, and other assorted fried goodies.....     MMmmmmmmm  Ok now rice.   Not a little but a huge plate of the rice along with chicken chow mien...     man...    there was a lot of food....  but wait there's more  Two more huge family style plates of noodles and sweet and sour chicken.   Table now covered in food...  and good food.   We ate and we ate but alas...   we barely ate half of it.      Listen if you're looking for the Vegas Strip style place...   this is not your place.   If you want to be seated and fed in a relaxed, local and unpretentious place, then give this a shot.     I've read some of the other reviews about the bland food and what not and I feel bad for those people that they had a bad experience.    Clearly they came on an off day because what we got was great....       Now I just need to go and digest....       Soooooo   Fuuuuuuullllll  PS    My fortune cookie was empty...   I have no fortune...    Oh my god I'm gonna die!!!!    Ok maybe not",

Off the main strip but worth the drive into lil chinatown. My favorite dish to get is the hot pot sea bass and tofu that leaves your taste buds wanting more. Great place to bring old school traditional Asian parents who crave authentic Chinese food :)",

    "text": "Just what you would expect from one of the top 50 Chinese Restaurants.  THE FOOD:  Authentic Chinese food and, while not as good as Hong Kong, it is easy to see why CNN rated JH in the USA top 50. It also earned Best Chinese Restaurant by the Las Vegas Review Journal in 2014. Live seafood in the tanks look healthy and vibrant. The wine list is extensive from house wine to Chateau Lafite.    Sea Food Wor Won Ton Soup (***  )   It is really hard for A Chinese Restaurant to mess this dish up and JH was no exception. While it was above average, it was not exceptional, There was Broccoli in this dish that was cooked just right.     Imperial Peking Duck (*****)  While the duck was prepared to perfection, this dish got five stars because of what they do with the carcass afterwards: the meat is stripped from the bones and minced then fried in a wok where it takes on a smoky savory flavor, the minced meat looked like it had some scallions in it and was served on lettuce leaves.  Braised Tofu with Salted Fish & Minced Chicken (*****)  Simple yet flavorful soft chunks of tofu with chicken and salted fish. The salted fish is slightly fermented lending an interesting flavor: the flavor was well balanced tho and the fish did not overwhelm the dish as it sometimes can.  Live King Crab (*****)  We had an 8 pound crab (don't know if it was the Alaskan or Australian but it was $69/lb) served two ways: the body (base of the legs) were served with Ginger Scallions and the Carapace and legs were sauteed with butter and garlic. The Ginger Scallions were cooked to perfection and well balanced. The garlic legs had fresh finely diced garlic piled on expertly halved leg sections: I found that the garlic was pretty strong for my taste but simply removing the garlic with a flick of my chopsticks solved that. The presentation was amazing but the portions were cut in such a way that the meat was easy to separate from the shell: well done!   Live Main Lobster (*****)  Ginger Scallions topped off this monster 7lb lobster and it was cooked to perfection (not over cooked and tender) and well balanced. The presentation was not as good as the crab but this is splitting hairs: so I still gave it 5 stars.  Chinese Broccoli in Oyster Sauce (***  )   Like the Wor Won Ton Soup, this dish is hard to do badly. Some places might over cook it but not here; it still maintained some crunch while being tender. Perfect!  Manila Clams - Ginger & Scallions (**** )  Fresh (maybe live it was so delicate) clams cooked just right. Not a stand out for me, but then again, I don't normally eat clams: the reason I gave it 4 stars was because the freshness of the clams was exceptional and delicate.   Taro Tapioca Soup (*****)  This hidden gem is not on the menu but served as a complimentary desert. small squares of White Taro rest on the bottom while Tapioca floats playfully on top of this milky warm desert soup. would have given it a six if I could!  THE SERVICE:  The Staff (****)  Well groomed and friendly; we were greeted and sat immediately. Not your usual Chinese Food wait staff: well spoken and attentive; beverage refills came quickly with out asking. Dishes were cleared and replaced with clean ones the moment they became cluttered with shells. Soup and wine were expertly served.  The Layout (**** )  The exterior was acceptable but not spotless (hey: this is Chinatown right!?), Live seafood tanks were clean and the animals were healthy and not showing any signs of stress. Tables were well set with clean table cloths and no grime/oil/leftovers on the settings. I knocked off a star for the restrooms (I know that it is bad luck to have a spotless restroom: but I hope a Chinese restaurant will break that tradition one day). Parking was scarce even tho the restaurant was half full (we parked in back).",

Place was pretty much empty, we were giving them business and they were standing around, watching but not watching to see if we would run. Thought it was funny. If I actually lived here I'd never come back.  That's pretty rude, we were two brown-skinned, decently dressed guys, not rappers with tattoos and bad attitudes or anything. Maybe they only want Chinatown locals to eat there, I don't know. I won't ever be back.",

    "text": "Got to try this place finally for the first time. Heard good things abut them so coming here was a no brainer.  I gotta give them props for their menu. It looks like they put a lot of thought and detail into it. For example, if you were craving a certain item like soup, bam! All the soups they have are all in one section. This applies to all others like noodles, seafood, etc. We ordered Salt n Pepper Calamari, Salt n Pepper Porkchops, and Honey Walnut Shrimp.   The Honey Walnut Shrimp was decent, but to me it seemed to lack a bit of sauce to it. When we got the plate, it already looked like somebody ate some shrimp off of it. If you refer to my picture, you can see that they don't give you much shrimp to begin with. The best Honey Walnut Shrimp I ever had was at Panda Inn in the city of La Palma, Ca.   Both the Salt n Pepper Porkchops and Salt n Pepper Calamari was very good. The only thing lacking I thought was some kind of sauce to dip it in. There was soy sauce on the table but that will only add to the saltiness of the two entrees. I was thinking sweet n sour sauce would be perfect to dip it in.   Service was very good. They took our order and processed it right away. We got our food in no time. Refills were constant and im glad because of the salt content we ordered which was good with the steamed rice we ate it with.  The main negative thing that stood out for me was the prices. With all the three items we ordered plus tax it came out to 41 dollars and that's without any drinks (we had water which was good because it was filtered and not tap water). I thought the food was good but 15 bucks a pop for the Honey Walnut Shrimp and the Salt n Pepper Porkchops is bit much. Even the appetizer Salt n Pepper Calamari was 8.99.   All in all I thought it was an ok experience based off of the negatives and positives that balanced each other out. All I know is be prepared to spend a lot of money if you are paying for a party of 4 or more.  P.S. They don't give out fortune cookies when you get your check and its a 20 dollar minimum to use debit/credit.",

They are always polite and quick, which is all I need from my take out place. One of my top five in Vegas for sure.",

    "text": "I came here with my hubby and his family for our vacation in Las Vegas during Chinese New Year.  The seafood here is incredibly fresh!! We ordered Chinese soup, steamed fish, steamed live shrimp, steamed free range chicken, beef brisket, abalone, and some vegetables.  The portions were quite big.  But the steamed live shrimp were huge! I mean each shrimp was three times the size of what I'm used to in Vancouver. They were juicy and the soy dipping sauce was a perfect touch.  The steamed fish was good too.  The beef brisket was just okay for me.  It didn't stand out.  The chicken was also just okay.  I'm not usually a fan of abalone but I feel they did a good job with it. The texture was tender and the sauce was really light and tasty. The service was good.  Our waiter came by to check on us and fill our wine glasses when they were empty.  Pretty authentic Chinese food.  Overall, I had a good experience.",

Diego our server was on point, and the busser and the other server who greeted and sat us were all friendly and prompt. Im a server at a fine dining restaurant here in Vegas and the service was great. We had the hot and sour soup and it was perfect, reminds me of the wonderful days I spent working at a Cantonese restaurant in Seattle over 10 years ago. We also had the Manilla clams in black bean sauce which were again, wonderful as expected. We washed it down with Tsingtao  and for $30 something (plus $10 tip...dont forget to tip people!!!) you can't go wrong. It is not overpriced anyone who says so is cheap. I can't wait to go back and try everything else! Oh and they close at 3am which is a bonus!",

Our.... stomachs were in pain and very uncomfortable  we felt bloated and painful stomach aches and vomiting  I was in so much pain I threw up several times and couldn't go to sleep I went to sleep around 5:30 am in the morning I'm very disappointed.",

My friend and I had the marinated fried chicken and beef chow fun and they were so tasty we finished all of our food. They don't charge for rice and tea either unlike some of the cheapo restaurants here in town. Most things on the menu are about the same price $9.95-11.95 is average for this place I'd say. But for the portions I don't think it's too bad. It was also quiet because it didn't get too packed while we were there. The employees are very friendly and food seems to come out fairly quickly. I look forward to coming back here in the future to try other dishes",

The facility is clean and bright with lots of seafood tanks for selecting fresh seafood.  The staff was friendly, efficient, and helpful.  For starters I had the Rosy Duck. The meat was tender and flavorful, and the skin was delightfully crisp. The plum sauce was pretty bad...another reviewer described it as \"industrial cleaner\"...which I'm sympathetic to. I'd definitely order this again...but will steer clear of the plum sauce.   For mains, I had the \"Salt and Pepper Pork Chops\" which many reviewers raved about. The batter and spicing/seasoning of the pork was very well done. Quite crisp and a good balance of salt/heat/batter/fat. The pork itself was quite disappointing though...very stringy, low-quality cut of pork. I would have MUCH rather had 1/2 or even 1/4 of the quantity for a better quality of pork.  For dessert I had the chocolate Mochi Ice Cream. It was served far too cold. The ice cream was actually chewy....more than a little. If served a bit warmer, it would have been good i think...the chocolate flavor was decent, the pastry wrapper was nicely done...just the temp.  I think maybe I didn't order the dishes these guys do best...next time I'm going to have to try the fresh seafood. Also, the prices were quite reasonable. Appetizer, entree, dessert, and hot tea for $26 in Vegas..that's a pretty good deal.",

This place got great reviews from my Elite friend, Jessica P.  Here's what we got:  Beef Chow Fun in Soy Sauce for $9.95.  Really flavorful, love the chow fun noodles, super soft with green onions.  Crispy Salt and Pepper Pork Chops for $10.95.  They said it was hot but it's not as hot as I thought.  There were jalapenos and red peppers.  This was AH-MAZE-ING.  The pork chops were perfectly cooked, batter was crispy and nice marbelized ratio.  HIGHLY RECOMMEND THAT DISH.    General Chow Chicken for $10.95.  Lots of flavor, great batter, included carrots and peas.  The sauce was a little too salty for me but if you like oyster, soy and other sauces combined, get this dish.  Crispy Fried Lemon Chicken for $10.95.  People, I have FINALLY found the perfect lemon chicken dish in Vegas.  The chicken was crispy, the lemon sauce was perfectly made and this dish made my meal!    Crispy Fried Dungeness Crab with Salt and Pepper for MKT PRICE.  PLEASE MAKE SURE THAT YOU CONFIRM THEIR PRICE.  We kept asking the server the price and it sounds like she was saying $6.95 and we kept asking her, however it turned out to be $16.95 and threw us for a loop when the check came.  I did like how they brought out the live crab in a bucket before cooking it.  It was juicy, crispy and perfectly flavored.     The place has a lot of stuff going on.  To me, the typical Chinese restaurant, full of Chiness decor and statues.  Round tables, only thing missing is a lazy Susan LOL.  They even ask if you want an ocean view seat, which is in front of a big fish tank.  The staff is on it.  They always refilled our drinks when the glass was 75% full.  I think that our little misunderstanding of the crab price was the only thing that I did not enjoy.  The staff kinda got a little impatient with us but other than that, I WILL BE BACK!",

After some gambling and a bit of drinking, the wife and I were craving some off the strip, more afordable Chinese food (yes I lost some dough at the tables that night). We enter here at about 12:30 am and obviously it is totally empty besides 1 other client. We are seated and start looking through the menu.   The restaurant itself is pretty big. It has a lively atmosphere with 1 flatscreen TV. They have a decent selection of beer which was cool. We end up ordering the basics wich were Honey Walnut Prawns, Pan Fried Noodles with beef, and fried rice. Huge portions which was prefect since I was starving.  Eveything tasted great. No complaints from us whatsoever. No we were not drunk, so our taste buds were definitely not decieving us. The walnut prawns were addicting, and had to have a fork fight with the wife to grab the last one. She won.  Our waiter was great the entire time. Wich of course he should, being as it was empty.  I would love to comeback and try some of the other dishes.  So if your having a late night craving, or just a craving for for Chinese grub in general, don' hesitate to stop by this place.",

The mister was craving some Chinese food, so we busted out Yelp on his iPhone and Joyful House was highly recommended.  Per some suggestions made by other Yelpers, I ordered the pan fired spinach in garlic sauce, the sauteed shrimp in sweet and sour sauce, e-fu noodles, and 1/2 order of peking duck.   The food was alright.  Nothing that kicked my socks off.  The peking duck was dry and slightly rubbery.  Also, they didn't even serve it with the bao bread or those puffy chips.  I liked the e-fu noodles, but it was a tad bit salty.  The shrimp was average and the spinach is something I could've cooked, so it wasn't special to me.    If this place is the best Chinese restaurant in Vegas, then I am afraid to try the other places.  Perhaps I have higher expectations since I have tasted great Chinese food back in Cali like in Chinatown, Monterrey Park, Alhambra, Rowland Heights, etc. I won't give up, the next time I am in Vegas, I will try another place and see how it is.",

They have tanks which are filled with shrimp, lobster, crabs, and fish in the main seating area. The staff is very friendly, and we're then offered some complimentary tea. It was great, very smooth and not o er brewed by any  means. With a light and subtle flavor it went perfectly with our meal which consisted of crispy fried salt and pepper tofu, Mongolian beef, and honey walnut shrimp. The crispy fried tofu was done to perfection. Great texture of crunch, the seasoning was done with perfect balance and wasn't to salty or peppery. I almost ate the whole dish to myself lol! We then got our Mongolian beef and honey walnut shrimp. I can say that the flavor of these two dishes were,the best that we have had. The only downside would be the texture of the beef. For us it could have been fried a little lo,her to get a nice crisp texture on the outside, but non the less the flavor was there and it didn't hinder us, with the jasmine rice It was awesome! Bow on to the honey walnut shrimp, THE BEST!!  Crazy but it really wast the best honey walnut shrimp we have ever had. The shrimp had a nice fried coating. The shrimp itself was savory. The dish hot it's sweetness from the walnuts. It seems like the walnuts were roasted with honey and honey alone. Mixed with fried shrimp and tossed with a light coating of mayo. What a surprise. I was expecting an overly sweet, saucey dish. But it was a great balance of sweet and savory. Everything went well and ended with teat which was a nice way to end our meal. The entire meal was above our expectations and gives US a reason to come back. The portions to me are a little small for the price but what you get back in flavor is awesome.",

As I've been here, Elite Emily (and LChee before he abandoned me) started dragging me into real Asian food, and of the places we've been so far, this is my favorite Chinese place. For those who are adventurous, eggplant clay pots and various prawns and what not are available for your dining palate, but if you have friends who are new to Asian or Chinese food, basic but delicious items are available, such as fried rice, sweet & sour pork, and lemon chicken. Last night I had the orange blossom beef. Simple but tasty with a delicious sauce.  Afraid to try other cuisines? Go to Joyful House, they can ease you into it. The staff is helpful too; if you have questions, they'll fill you in!",

Ordered 5 dishes and most were subpar and overpriced for the portion they give.   - Pork belly with preserved vegetables was terrible, I am not sure how they could even bring themselves to call it that, all the ingredients were there, but it is like they didn't even try to make it properly. It was dry and probably been precooked in the kitchen for a while, have had canned versions that were immensely better than this. - The salt and pepper pork chop was even worse, the meat itself was flavorless and they didn't even bother to properly spread the seasoning, ending up with a couple pieces over seasoned  and the rest tasteless. - The eggplant and tofu dish was the only good dish. I am a sucker for crispy outside and silky smooth inside tofu. Eggplant was fried very well, reminds me of what you would get in a fresh dim sum restaurant. - Pineapple pork was not edible, it was mostly breading and soggy sweet and sour pork. - Sizzling beef with shacha sauce was ok, beef was done well, soft and tender, flavoring was a bit off.",

There was a special on flounder so we decided to try it steamed with soya sauce and Chinese wine and ginger, garlic and green onion for $19.95.  Such delicate taste.    The other dish to die for is the Rosy Duck - 1/2 order - skin so crispy and the meat so tender.    We also ordered the braised tofu and black mushrooms with choy sum.   Good dish.  Also, Chinese brocolli or kai lan with garlic - very green and fresh with loads of garlic!    Free Chinese dessert of the day was red bean soup.  Very well done.",

I only gave it 3 stars because of the service.  Our waitress never came to check on us.  We would have to ask random employees for more water, salt & pepper (they were not on any table) and sugar for the tea.  When we requested sugar, the lady kind of scoffed at us.  They took our food away to put it in to-go containers, which I really don't feel comfortable with.  Then they refused to give us the steamed rice in our to-go container; however, they came and swooped it off the table.  Leading me to wonder where is that rice going?  I would probably eat here again, but it did not end my quest for the best chinese place in Vegas.",

I wanted really good nonamericanized Chinese food and we just happen to pass this one and decided to give it a try.   Pros:  good sea bass but how could anyone mess that up?, beef was really tender, waiter was friendly Cons: we ordered snow pea leaves and they brought out snow peas, they took it back and brought us the correct dish but ended up charging us for both dishes and we didn't even get to eat the first one they took back, charging 16.95 for a small amount of snow peas is unacceptable, we didn't want to spend time arguing with them so we paid and left but felt it was unethical practice, we will never return! The wonton soup is the worst we ever had also.  In summary, overall the main dishes are decent but over priced and make sure you ask how much anything is or you could end up paying an outrageous price.",

Joyful House the best we have found yet.  It is not delivery, but the takeout service was quick and attentive.  Appetizers - the Crab Rangoon and Potstickers were good.  The Crispy Fried Prawns were a bit thick on the breading, but the prawns themselves were flavorful.  Main dishes - The Beef Tenderloin Mignon With Onion really was filet mignon, so far as I could tell.  Very tender and flavorful, and they didn't skimp on the beef.  The Sweet and Sour Pork was also flavorful, with only a hint of toughness; and the sauce did not drown out the flavor of the pork.  The soft Pan Fried Noodles With Chicken was also well-prepared, with small but tender chunks of chicken breast.  The prices were a little more than what we are used to, which is odd because coming from Los Angeles almost everything is much cheaper in Las Vegas.  While we have not quite given up on trying some other places, we would be entirely satisfied to stick with Joyful House as our \"go to\" Chinese food in Las Vegas.",
