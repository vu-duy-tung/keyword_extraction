    "text": "Maybe I just had high expectations walking in here, but I don't see myself being stoked to pay this much for a pizza if it's not absolutely wonderful, and unfortunately, this just wasn't.    The positives: *This is my favorite type of pizza.  Thin, crispy, not greasy, unprocessed cheese, fresh ingredients. *The patio area is lovely. *The passion fruit iced tea is top notch. *The meatball topping is very nice. *The cheesecake is delicious. *Portions are generous.  The negatives: *The antipasto didn't come with lettuce, so we got a house salad instead.  The house salad was large, but almost 90% lettuce.  Lame. *They don't serve ranch (I take this personally).  Not only do they not serve ranch, but when I asked for it while ordering the salad, our server didn't say anything about not having it.  I was pretty disappointed when the salad came with a big dish of \"vinaigrette\" on the side.  Vinaigrette = a monkey dish full of oil, with half a teaspoon of some murky purple crap at the bottom.  I couldn't mix the oil into the murky purple crap, or get the murky purple crap out past the oil.  It was disgusting.  If I had been told they didn't have ranch, I probably would have gotten a different salad, or none at all.  The only other dressing they had was Caesar, and I'm not a fan.  There are like 8 salads on the menu, what's with the crappy dressing selection?  :( *Pizza toppings are all sold separately from the pizza, and they cost $2-$5 each.  Adds up fast. *The crust stops tasting good as soon as the pizza cools down. *The sauce is a bit too sweet. *The service is a little weird.  The pizza came while I was working on the salad, and I told the server that I would use the same plate.  She then unceremoniously plopped a giant slice of pizza onto my plate (still half full of salad) while I was actively eating from it.  Wtf?  I think I'll stick to Metro.",

    "text": "I'm a frequenter of Sambalatte, so I've seen Grimaldi's quite a few times and so I knew I wanted to try i. A friend also said she had tried their Henderson location and liked it - so we ended up trying this location.   I did enjoy the pizza. Crust was great, thin and crispy just the way I like it. Was it worth the price though? I wouldn't say so. We added the sausage($2), mushrooms($2), & roasted red peppers($4) to the pizza. Pretty expensive for toppings in my opinion... especially the red peppers. I was surprised they cost more than the sausage.   Now, I'm not sure if it was because we were siting outside, where it was a bit chilly - or if it was the pizza - but after about 4 or 5 minutes, the pizza was cold. And, I'm not a big fan of cold pizza.  Service wise, it was decent service. Our server was friendly, but maybe a little too friendly. She took it upon herself to look at my friends iPhone, where she saw she had received a text message, and then proceeded to 'pretend' to unlock it. Now, I don't know about some of you... but I don't prefer to have strangers touch my phone... let alone try and read my text messages.",

This place is tops for customer service, everyone and I mean everyone is VERY friendly and helpful. We first sat at the bar while we were waiting for our table and the bartender explained the menu to us, we got seated and our waiter was great, the manager even came by and spoke to us for a while, other customers as well. Its not the cheapest place in town for a pizza but it is very good and the customer service is OUTSTANDING.  We had drinks, appetizers, pizzas and a desert that including a trio of their deserts and the total bill was around $70.00. We will be back.",

They keep the menu simple, with pizza and salad. And that is all you need. The salads are spot-on and the pizza is magisterial. The service can be hit or miss, and there is nothing special about the decor, but the pizza alone is enough for the five-star rating. As an added bonus, they have a solid wine list that is very reasonable! (The Coppola Rosso is one of the best wine deals in any restaurant.)",

    "text": "I had an odd experience at Grimaldi's. I have never had a meal start at one star level and then gradually slip into another star dimension. If I had taken one, hot bite and jumped on here to write a review, I would probably have given the pie a solid 4 stars, but that is not what happened. The pizza slowly became a hot, or rather cold, mess.   The place is cute with old wine bottle chandeliers. The bottoms are cut out, and the bulbs are contained within the bottle. They are clustered around the ceiling and are quite fascinating. It took a minute for our server to show up and greet us, and for some reason, on Saturday evening I was being a stickler for service, so that bothered me a bit. It is quite possible that the brightness of the wine bottle chandeliers made me hypersensitive. The bar area might be more comfortable.  We ordered a small salad and a large pizza with onion, garlic and jalapeno. Based on that scent profile, it is pretty obvious that I already have a man. The small salad was a huge and a good value at $5. The dressing wasn't a standout; it lacked that vinegary punch! Then the pie arrived. As I have been at other local pie joints, I was underwhelmed by the volume of toppings. I might start showing up with my own. Just start pulling baggies of onions and mushrooms at of my purse. Anyways, the first slice of the pizza was great. The sauce is a little sweet, and the crust was a tad crispy, but still with a good chew. No burnt edges, which meant I ate all of the crust. However, as the pizza started to get cold, the crust became stale.   Perhaps it is yeast or oil deprivation. The pizza was the least greasy pizza I have had in quite some time, but I would trade in a stale pizza for a big ol' greasy pizza any day of the week. Maybe we went on a weak dough day, so I am up for a revisit, but for now it is a 3.44 star deal, which sadly requires rounding down.",

Now if they could only open another location closer to my house so I can have delivery. I would give them six stars for that.   I do find it funny how you see a lot of Californians come out just to eat the pizza here. I do sympathize since its impossible to open a new coal pizza oven joint in the golden state. (From what I have heard). On second thought maybe I don't since we need the tourists.",

The pizza here was not only not good, but it was an expensive not good! The crust. Supposedly made with water from NY....Ok... ??? It was charred and burnt. So who cares? Sauce? I'm not sure if there was any on there but if there was, it had No flavor at all. Cheese? What was there was cooked to complete dry papery bubbles. All I can tell you is that it was white. The pepperoni? Thick and Dime sized??? That is NOT Italian! One basil leaf dried out to a crisp in the middle of the pizza... Why?  I could throw a Pillsbury biscuit topped with ketchup and Kraft cheese in a fire pit and have it taste better than this stuff!  Oh... and this restaurant doesn't serve ranch dressing. Wow. People, this is just another chain restaurant with a gimmick. Get over being suckered. Go get a real pizza, have you been to Montesanos?... Or Villa on Sahara and Valley View? How bout Metro?... The noise level and the super bright lighting alone should be all the deterrent you need to turn heel and scram from this place. Not to mention the parking! OMG!!!",

For pizza in a new venue I normally go with the tried and True sausage & pepperoni before experimenting with fancier toppings. A large italian sausage, pepperoni, and roasted red pepper pizza ($24) was served piping hot with just the right amount of crispiness. Delicious and filling.

The salad was very tasty with healthy sized crouton and plenty of cheese. The dressing was not too \"fishy\", in fact, it was very good.   The pizza was cooked great and the crust was the thinnest I have ever had. The pizza was very authentic rustic Italian with lots of sauce and cheese blotted across the pizza.   My only complaint, if I was forced to complain, would be that they served Pepsi products instead of Diet Coke.   The staff was friendly and attentive. The food was good; a little pricey for pizza, but good. The best part was sitting outside and watching all the goofballs thinking they're special walking in and out of Kona Grill next door. Hahaha!",

    "text": "I will admit that I am a tough critic on pizza restaurants. I have been making pizza at home for 30 years so I know what type of crust and toppings that I prefer.   Things looked good when we entered the restaurant and I noticed slightly blackened crusts on the pizzas as I enjoy a crisp crust with light toppings. Normally I order a pizza Margarita (tomato and basil) as it gives me a good idea of the quality of the ingredients and the crust structure and flavor. In this case, I also ordered some of the red peppers as an additional topping. The pizza that was delivered to the table was quite a disappointment. Smothered in sliced tomatoes, the moisture of the tomatoes and the peppers made a very soggy crust I expect a thin crust to be slightly crisp not wet and and soft. I don't mind paying $24 for a pizza (basic pizza $16+$4 for peppers+$2 for tomatoes+$2 for basil) but it really needs to be exceptional. This one was not. By the way, I have never before been charged extra for basil on my pizza!  The Mediterranean salad was OK (large, $10) and service was prompt although my half empty water glass was never re-filled.  Maybe this is a good place to sit on the outside patio for a drink or two but I think that  their main and only dish, pizza, is really not up to par especially for the price. I would prefer Sammy's or Metro any day.",

If your into real pizza, not from pizza hut or domino's then this is the place to go. You basically order the base of your pizza and add toppings.

The pizza was there.  Or, at least, that's how I remember it.  The pizza hit the spot.  The crust was crisp and also soft.

I ordered a personal pizza which is a 12\" pie with 6 slices, good proportion. I had it topped with bacon and onion and their famous sauce is up to par. I'm used to Frank Pepe's in New Haven, CT which is voted Best Pizza in the nation and world renowned.    Grimaldis is definitely best in Las Vegas but doesn't compare to Pepe's.  But it's up there so it does deserve 4 stars, service was good and the atmosphere fits the style of the restaurant. The crust of the pizza is perfectly thin, and crunchy, love that. The pies came out in a reasonable fashion. The pizzas are priced pretty well, although I think they should have some signature pies. Definitely will be coming back. Always love a good pie. The white pizza with garlic is awesome as well. I recommend this place to anyone.   My favorite combo is bacon and onion , try it out.",

Our family ordered the Chefs choice half of the Brooklyn and the other half Don. The sausage here is what Im really a big fan off along with the sauce and very hearty roasted red peppers which make a great addition for your hungry taste buds. If you are ever in the Boca Park I suggest you stop by for a large pizza. Its a great time for the family and the Red Sangria is mouthwatering. Until next time!",

I could taste each of the four components of my pizza. The sausage was moist and not greasy with good seasoning. The cheese wasn't just plain mozzarella, it had some extra herbs or seasonings, it had a interesting mellow flavor with a little \"extra\". The sauce was wasn't acidic but still had a good taste of tomatoe. The crust was thin with a good chew, it had the perfect thickness.  On the other hand, it wasn't that filling. For being a large pizza, it was less filling than the Naples style pizza that I have tried, which tend to be meant for one person.   I also got a canoli. The pastry part was fried too hard. The cream was on point, it was creamy without being overly sweet.  I'll come here again, even though the price point to \"getting full\" ratio is a little off here. Also since I took the pizza to-go and didn't get to taste it right out the oven.",

Let me start off by saying that I love pizza. If I could eat pizza everyday, I would! I'm normally not a huge fan of thin crust but we ordered a large pepperoni, ricotta and sausage pizza and it was great. My only issue was that there was too much ricotta, so every bite we took had a nice hunk of ricotta but I shouldn't be complaining... Fresh ingredients, super hot, had a nice crunch to it and it was huge!   We also ordered the large House salad (I think) and a small plate of antipasta. We had about half of the pizza left to take home. Great quality for a really decent price.   Our server was very nice and came back frequently to check on us. some people were dressed casually (like my friends and I in gym clothes) or dressed up. There was a couple next to use that seemed to be on their first date and another table with two ladies enjoying wine.   Can't wait to come back!",

They give the kids some dough to play with to pass the time, and there's an observation window in the back for them to watch the pizzas being made. Score!  The decor is pretty cool with wine bottles for pendant lights at the bar area and hanging from the ceilings. It's a very \"New York\" vibe with old signage from the original grimaldis.   I love eating outside, so it's a big draw to me when restaurants have that as an option.   I was not a fan, however, of their calzones. It was a huge crust filled mostly with air, and then some sauce and meet sat sadly at the bottom, like the last bit of water in the tub that didn't make it down yet. Oh well, just not for me.",

Their pepperoni is my favorite because the pepperonis are small and taste very flavorful like real meat unlike most cheap pepperoni pizzas. I also like to add jalapeno for a bit of a kick. Although that is my favorite I know many other people who love their other toppings (meatballs, sausage, etc) and even their white pizza! I would say getting a Caesar salad with your pizza is a must as it is absolutely the best Caesar dressing I have ever had!  I always dip my crust in it afterwards- so delicious! I always ask for extra dressing I really think it is part of the whole grimaldis experience! The inside is very cute as well (except they need more, larger restrooms)  and always good service.",

The pizzas are New York style so the crust is thin and crispy. We ordered a small(16\") with sausage, bacon, mushrooms, and black olives. They inadvertantly added onions as well and were so apologetic that they offered to bake the pizza we'd ordered while we ate the one they'd brought to the table. We were okay with the onions so we told them not to bother baking another one. Our waitress apologized to us about the onions several times as we ate and was very attentive to our needs. The pizza was very tasty, but I have to admit that I would prefer a slightly thicker crust. You couldn't really pick up the slices--they drooped down so far that the toppings fell off. So we had to use a knife anf fork. But all in all, we enjoyed the pizza and were impressed with the service.",

    "text": "I was surprised and delighted that Grimaldi's was so close to our hotel, The Trump. After our first night in Vegas, I woke up starving and frustrated, as our digs weren't super close to the strip and I wasn't trying to eat at the hotel in such a food-centered city. So after some quick Yelping, I found Grimaldi's, which I had previously heard about on some show on the Food Network, but didn't realize they had locations out West. We ordered a custom pizza and it came out solid, with crisp crust and just enough good quality, chewy mozzarella. Our salad was fresh, service professional, and the cheesecake was worth the calories. If you're looking for pizza and you're anywhere near Fashion Valley, this is the spot.",

You pick your size and sauce, then choose your toppings. I was a little anxious seeing some of the prices for toppings ($2 for pepperoni, $4 for Italian sausage etc), but after we received our order it made sense. The pizza was incredible, and the portions on it were generous. My wife could only eat 1 piece and out of sheer determination I ate 2 ( remember the sticker shock? I was determined to make it worth it!). After ordering the 18\" with 4 toppings (pepperoni, black olives, sundried tomatoes and Italian sausage) and 3 drinks our bill came out to ~$50. It was worth it, and we'll be back in the future",

The pepperoni pizza is my favorite, and the white pizza with garlic is good too. When I'm craving a tasty salad, this is one of the first places I think of.  My favorite is the Mediterranean with extra feta. Their cheesecake is also suuuuuuuper good.  They have seasonal flavors and plain and it's so delicious.  This location is right next door to a Cheesecake Factory and I'd pick Grimaldi's first any day. It's made on site and it's never frozen.  Prices are really reasonable for the quality of service and food that you're getting. I've always had a good experience with Grimaldi's, whether I've dined in or called in an order and picked it up.",

I would prefer pieology/blaze over this place any day.  The toppings were okay, but really didn't stand out compared to any other pizza place.  We added spinach to our white pizza and you could barely tell if there was any spinach and the spinach you could find was almost black =(.  Also, we got two 18\" pizzas and they came out about 20 minutes apart....  The service was mediocre.  Upon arriving with a reservation, we were greeted with panic because clearly they were not prepared to seat us and had to find tables to squeeze our party in.  We also had 3 kids at our table and they did not offer us crayons/dough to entertain the kids.  Better pizza to be had for a lower price and quicker service at pieology/blaze.  The only reason I would come back here is the restaurant has better ambiance compared to the fast food pizza places.",

The best part is how many combinations you can chose to go with. You never have to have the same pizza twice.  My boyfriend and I came here recently got a small which was plenty enough to share. We started with the caprese for an appetizer which was so so but for the pizza we went with meatballs, artichoke, mushrooms, basil, garlic and sundries tomatoes. Ah-mazing! The best part is the crust being crispy throughout the whole pizza. I cannot stand soggy pizza so it's definitely a plus for me.   If you're looking for good, quality pizza look no further!",

This cheesecake is made on-site, has strawberries IN the cake itself and is DREAMY. This is a must-have. Upon asking about the wine selection, he brought us a bottle of wine that he proceeded to show us it had a \"live label.\" He then gave us a glimpse of what that is... When he showed the label through his phone, it came to life with a story of the man who was on the panel! Amazing. Thank you, David, for making our dinner that much better!",

Chilled Panna water and Manhattans with several maraschino cherries set the table. Dean Martin croons in the background.   I appreciate the access to indoor and outdoor seating. Indoors, the children enjoy watching pizza preparation as they peer through a window overlooking the chefs' kitchen. Outdoors, I don't fret about an accidentally spilled drink and mounds of fallen crumbs. Rather, our focus is on the breeze, a fountain, and at times live music (for example from a nearby restaurant on Cinco de Mayo).  Grimaldi's is prompt to provide crayon packs and kid fun activity menus. Another kid-friendly aspect is the mound of fresh, pliable pizza dough presented on a silver pizza tray to each child. This hands-on activity keeps everyone entertained.  The gluten-free pizza menu is a build your own product. I prefer the GF basil pesto pizza for $16, I too it with red onions and artichoke hearts. The fresh, crunchy Kale Chopped Salad I opt to omit the shaved parmesan ( although the salty taste adds flavor and gritty texture to those who can eat dairy). The Greek olives, sweet red onions, lemons are a blend of refreshing and tangy flavors. Check out the seasonal menu. We ordered an 18\" pizza with chicken BBQ.  Be patient with finding a parking spot. Valet is also an option.  Sorry i missed the photo opportunities to share. Life gets busy with kids.",

The exception being the busboy who reeked of what smelled like Hai Karate! But the front girls and the waitresses were very nice smelling. And better yet, competent and friendly. Yay team!

Canollis are amazing, just not big enough.",

    "text": "After a terrific Yelp event at a Grimaldi's nowhere near where I live, I thought it was time to visit the one in Boca Park, close to home.  It's been open for a long time, but it was new for me.  I had sampled their private label red wine, Mille Gradi, at the event.  It's a red, which I don't drink.  But I loved it so much that I was looking forward to ordering it.  That is, until I saw the price.  I don't usually get wine that's $10 a glass (how un-Yelpy of me, I know), but threw all resolve to the wind and treated myself.  Some of the wines are reasonably priced, but more aren't.  Case in point: Sangria straight out of a bottle is $11.  I think not.  At most other places it's cheaper than all other wines, even when homemade.  I've just looked at their menu online and find that the wine prices listed are completely outdated, some as much as $3 a glass less than what you're charged at the restaurant.  This is all too common, and really pisses me off.  If I had checked it out before we went, I'd have been a bit riled.  I don't like sticker shock.  I don't think it's deliberate, just laziness, or they don't want to pay someone to update it.  I appreciate a pizza place whose decor is more like a nice restaurant than a pizza take-out.  It's pretty, warm, big but cozy, with great lighting and atmosphere.  We shared a small Mediterranean salad, and that size was actually pretty big, more than enough for the two of us to have a substantial portion. I forgot to ask for the dressing on the side, and was happy that the salad wasn't drowning in it - it had just the right amount, though some people might have to ask for more.  We got a large pizza, with green pepper, baby spinach, and sliced Roma tomatoes.  Spinach, what spinach??  You can buy a bag of baby spinach for $2 bucks and wallpaper at least 10 pizzas with it.  On our pizza, no slice had more than one leaf, a few of those were burned beyond recognition, and too many had none at all.  I'm not one to shut up and eat, so I brought it to the attention of the waitress.  The manager came over, too, and they offered to remake the whole pizza.  To their credit, and our surprise, they didn't take the first pizza and throw it out, but asked us if we wanted to take it home, along with the leftover new pizza.   I did enjoy the final pizza, though the (red) sauce is a bit light.  I prefer chunky tomatoes and a heavier sauce.  But I did like the crust, because it was crisp and not salty.  The service was excellent, and the manager, David, was extremely friendly and chatty, which we like.  Maybe it was his NY accent, though he's from upstate, but not too far upstate :)  I wish that Grimaldi's wasn't so pricey, because it will impact future visits.  We'll definitely return, but not as often as we might like.",

I would go more often, but the service... oh the service....  The service during lunch, brings this place down from a 5 star pizza place to a 3 star place.  Drink refills are always lacking, late and never there.  It almost seems like they're understaffed.  The pizza takes a looooong time to get out of the kitchen.  By then we're irritated and extremely hungry.    At that point, we just eat as quickly as possible and leave.     Your waitresses need to check in and give more refills.  The only time we see them is: 1 Taking our order, 2 checking in AFTER the pizza comes, and 3 to give us our check.",

It was literally pieces of salami, mozzarella,  tomatoes, red peppers and olives put separately on a plate and given to you. LOL NO Lettuce, nothing else. I guess I assumed the antipasto be like a chopped salad that included lettuce but it was my wrong doing for not asking first. It wasn't the best I've ever had either. The margherita pizza was a little soggy and grossed me out but I still ate it because I was starving. The white pizza was delicious. I highly recommend that. Definitely not the best pizza I've ever had, but the experience was worthwhile.",

A friend of mine in Phoenix said that she ate at a Grimaldi's and it was the first real East Coast pizza she's had in the 2 years she has been there, so we decided to check this places out. We realized that this is an offshoot of the Grimaldi's in Brooklyn and in Hoboken that we had eaten at many times so I was pumped.    Grimaldi's did not disappoint at all and totally lived up to my high expectations. The three of us split a delicious antipasto platter with mozzarella, salami, olives, bread, and peppers. I would totally get it again. Then we split a large pepperoni and mushroom pizza and it was amazing. The toppings were fresh and delicious, the crust was perfect, and the seasoning was just right. They do put parmesan on the pizza, and thankfully we asked them not to since my dad hates it, and they were very accommodating.   The service was friendly, at just the right pace, and the atmosphere was great. I loved the patio seating as well. Without a doubt I will be back again.",

The waitress gave this bland spiel about how the water and ingredients come from Brooklyn, blah blah, I didn't really care, I don't come from NY, I just like good food.   We got plain sliced french bread as an appetizer (was served with do it yourself balsamic vin and evoo). It seemed like kind of a cheap free appetizer, but whatever it goes with pizza, its Italian.  We ordered Small white pizza with sausage and tomato (pretty damn good), inversion IPA ( which was bottled) and a house pinot grigio, which was ok.  My hubby was blown away by the pizza, I thought it was good, but not the best i ever had. Between the two of us, we finished it off with no leftovers. I definitely want to go again and try a more plain pizza, like red pizza with pepperoni. If my decision is the same after that, I will not return as this place is, in my opinion, too pricey for just two people to eat at.",

As for the pizza, I think it was pretty decent quality, the pizza I ate this particular night was thin crust, sausage, and ricotta cheese. It was \"A-Ok\"- I wasn't jumping up and down about it but it wasn't bad at all. I didn't like how cold it got in a matter of minutes though. I also tried the red sangria- which was also just \"A-OK\" I've had better.   I will definitely give this place another try sometime and my hope is to get something around 5 star value! :D",

    "text": "Grimaldi's is a little expensive for pizza, but in this case you get what you pay for.  Their small is like most mediums (16\") and the large is, well, large!  They advertise coal brick oven pizza and that's exactly what you get: delicious, thin crust pizza with very fresh toppings.  There are a several pizzas (combinations of toppings) on the menu you can chose from, but you can also create your own from a reasonable list of toppings and sauce types.  The staff is fantastic every time I've gone.  You're greeted warmly at the door, seated and quickly have the attention of one of the waitstaff.  I've also ordered pizza to go and don't mind the wait while it cooks.  You're invited to sit at the bar, located close to the front of the restaurant, where the bartenders have also always been awesome.  There are TVs over the bar, and I've always been offered a courtesy soft drink while I wait.  They bring the pizza to you, check to see that it's what you want, pay the bill and  you're on your way.  My only word of advise for those who take out:  because the pizza is thin crust, it cools very fast.  I only live a few miles from the restaurant but my pizzas usually need a little love in the oven by the time I get home.  That said, it's never hurt the flavor and I definitely wouldn't avoid Grimaldi's for take-out because of this.  Fantastic restaurant with fantastic food.  Enjoy!",

    "text": "Even though I've lived in Las Vegas a few years, this is the first time I've eaten at any one of the Grimaldi's spots. I'm sad that I haven't eaten here sooner because the pizza we got was delicious. I don't really care what type of pizza it is or how \"authentic\" it may or may not be. The only thing I really care is how it tastes. And, the pie that we had was mighty good.  We started with a mediocre  small Mediterranean salad ($7). It was large enough for three or four.  The pizza we tried was a small white with garlic ($16) with two toppings (pepperoni and mushrooms, $2 each). The crust was excellent, with a decent amount of it charred, as can be expected from a brick oven place. Even with all the cheese and pepperoni that was on the pizza, the bottom of the crust held up well and wasn't soggy, providing a crisp and crackling texture with every bite.  The small pizza is more like a medium and is large enough for two to share. Their \"personal pizza\" is what others would consider a small.  The most annoying thing about this place is that toppings are the same price no matter what size of pizza you get. Obviously, you're going to get more pepperoni, for example, if you get a large pizza. But, if you get a personal pizza you get less but have to pay the same price. These pies aren't cheap, so when you start adding toppings the price can get ridiculous.  I'm not sure I'll be back to this location, just because finding parking at Boca Park is always a hassle. But I will stop by another Grimaldi's spot to get my pizza fix.",

But in seriousness, the pizzas are excellent, with a full range of toppings and sides, and it's easy to get enough for two people.  The service during my visit was excellent.  The server was very conscientious, making sure that my beer was poured properly without a foamy head.  It was just little touches that made the dining experience pleasurable.   Pricing was decent.  You pay for each topping separately, so a more ambitious pizza would become more costly.  But three toppings was a sweet spot.  Service was very fast for a weekend lunch, but nothing felt or tasted rushed.  I liked this place a lot in Dallas, so I am happy to see one here in town.  It's good pizza.

We got a pepperoni and sausage pizza, and added ricotta cheese, and hot diggity dang was that a good pizza. If you are looking for a romantic quite spot then I would not recommend Grimaldi's you are sitting pretty open and it tends to get a bit noisy, especially on the weekends. They do offer take-out and have a small bar to enjoy a few barley pops-- and grape juice.",

I wouldn't change a thing about the pizza.  My only complaint might be that the people that work at the bar, never seem to notice me waiting to pick up my order, as they continue to talk and mess around with each other.  I have never eaten there, so the servers might be better.  But, at the bar they make it seem like I'm bothering them to do their job.  Other than that small gripe, I love the pizza! I wish they delivered!    And a note to the people that mention weird cheese in their reviews, that's what fresh mozzarella is like. Maybe you have become used to the plastic fake cheese out of a bag from dominos.",

    "text": "Great pizza, great service.   I came here with a few friends and this was the first time any of us has every been to any of the Grimaldi's locations. The menu looked pretty small at first, but it just has everything you could possibly need/want here. We went with a large house salad: Romaine lettuce, red onions, cherry tomatoes, oven roasted sweet red peppers, mushrooms, olives, and Vinaigrette dressing ($8), a large white w/ garlic pizza with meatballs and mushrooms ($22), and two Cannolis ($4.50 ea.).   The salad came out in a bowl that was just big enough to fit the portion of salad in it, so it looked like there wasn't much salad at first, but there was actually more than enough for all four of us. I guess I'm just so used to places putting salad in oversized bowls that I don't realize what the \"right\" amount looks like. We each had at least 2 servings each and there was still some leftover. The salad was very fresh and I really enjoyed the mushrooms and Vinaigrette dressing. It's not too often that I have salad with mushrooms in it. The pizza blew all of us away. The crust was very thin, but not dry or overcooked. There were also a lot of garlic bits on top, but it surprisingly didn't bother any of us. It also had a pretty good amount of mushrooms on top, which I loved.  Our waitress was always checking up on us and refilling our drinks throughout our time here and she would even give her recommendations, tell us a little bit about the different menu items, and even joke around a little. It really added to our experience here.  Tip *Sign up for their birthday promo. You get a free large pizza!",

    "text": "My favorite pizza in Vegas, if not, the whole entire world. I know that's a dangerous statement to make for a chain restaurant, but I don't care! My order is typically a large white pizza with garlic (already comes with pizza), pepperoni, mushrooms and sausage. Then we get oregano, garlic powder, and Parmesan cheese on the side... and then a side of Caesar salad dressing - great for crust dipping, but I end up throwing some on my pizza as well. I'll go back and forth between the Caprese and the Caesar salad, but I think the Caprese has really good mozzarella and the tomatoes they use are really hearty. I started to get embarrassed here when the hostess kept on remembering us and always said \"welcome back\", but it's really more of a nod to their great customer service here. As of late, we've just been heading straight to the bar to be served by Erin, who is one of the friendliest and thoughtful servers/bartenders you can ask for. She even remembers our order now too, right down to the drinks, but always checks with us first just in case we want to spice things up. Reliable and delicious pizza definitely keep me coming back and hasn't left me disappointed, so I'm really afraid to venture off to the other Grimaldi's locations. We always end up bringing 4-6 slices home with us, but they are great for leftovers the next day. To reheat, we put the pizza on a non-stick pan over medium heat, cover with foil, heat for a couple of minutes or until cheese is soft, and then we once again have hot and crispy pizza ready to go. There's a special going on right now, buy a $50 gift card, get $10 gift card for yourself, buy $100, get $20. Of course, I opted for the $100 and bought it basically for myself. I just went hear a few days ago and already can't wait to go back :D",

The pizza was good, but exhausting to get to. The local Grimaldi's has the great food with none of annoyances.  If you insist on thick crust/Chicago style pizza or don't really care what people throw on your pizza then, seriously, what are you doing?  Do some frickin research.  But if you like thin crust pizza, with high quality ingredients, this is the place for you.    I suggest asking for extra cheese.  The mozzarella has always been the bomb and worth every penny.  All the ingredients are high quality and you will end up paying more for your pizza, but, imho, it is worth it.",

Walking in we were greeted and the inside was packed. We had to wait just a short couple of minutes before being seated. To get things started I ordered the Antipasto which I have have each visit and liked it just as much this time too, It's simple yet tasty. I picked a pizza with pepperoni and sausage and let me tell you this pizza was bomb! I don't like it when a pizza has too much sauce and this pizza was just right.

My husband and I ordered our usual pizza, half Brooklyn Bridge and half veggie. We waited and waited and waited for our pizza like over 45 minutes with no explanation why everyone around us was enjoying and eating their pizzas and we had nothing. Finally, our server said that there was a hole in our pizza.  ?  Anyway, shortly after, we were brought a pizza with a big slice missing, and the pizza looked like it fell on the floor. We were then told that they are preparing another \"slice\" for us. Skeptically, and because I was starving, I tried to pick up a slice. The entire piece of pizza wilted and all of the toppings slid off. I waived down the manager, who knew the pizza was not acceptable, and he said there was another one in the oven for us. Well, long story short, the second pizza was burnt terribly. I didn't want to complain again. Took the pizza home and threw it out. I won't give up on Grimaldi's, only this location for how poorly they handled the situation. No apologies, no real explanation... comped us a cheesecake, but that was not what we went in for. One star guys... treat your customers better than what we went through.",

Love the patio which is close to a fountain and adds a nice ambiance. The pizza was fresh and hot and very tasty! I made it just before they shut down the ovens for an hour (which I didn't see posted at the restaurant). Lucky me, I was really looking forward to a birthday pizza! A great spot to eat outdoors and bask in our lovely weather while enjoying one of the Valley's best pies! They are very generous with toppings and I doubt many other joints are as generous as Grimaldi's!",

Our salad was supposed to come out first, but the \"salad lady\" was behind and the oven was going fast, so they came at the same time. Our waitress brought the kids pizza out right away and they even offered to remake our pizza if we didn't want the salad at the same time. They offered us a free dessert for the water and salad issues, and the manager came to personally check on us. The food was great and I love the space so much better than the one on Eastern we usually go to.",

I must admit, there was not slice left in the pan! The pizza was thin tossed with a crispy crunch. Nicely burnt edges.  Cheesy and loaded with tiny pepperoni's!  We were very pleased and our bellies were full when we left for our hotel. A great deal for the price, great service and atmosphere! We will be back when we visit Grimaldi's in Vegas again!

We ordered a marinara pizza, anchovy, garlic and no cheese-our standby choice for years, but it came out w/minimal sauce and dry. We asked for extra sauce but by time it came pizza was cold and hard. Spoke to manager about our past experiences of ordering this pizza and them laying the sauce down first over entire area vs a few dollops if sauce in too - and his response \"this is how we do it and have always done it\". So obviously our past experience over being long time customers was discounted and disregarded. Well we don't like \"how you do it\" and won't be back based on this manager's \"could care less\" attitude. Settobello it is!",

    "text": "After 5 hours of walking and shopping at the LV Premium Outlets, we worked up a big appetite. On the drive home it was decided that tacos and guacamole from Chipotle could be a quick & easy dinner, but as we passed by the newly opened (1 month ago?) Grimaldi's in Boca Park, we made a last-minute decision to give their pizza a spin.  We order a small house salad ($5) and it is large enough to feed 3-4 people, so the two of us have plenty of green to eat. The house vinaigrette is not very vinegary, but the tomatoes and mushrooms are fresh and the whole green olives are good quality. We order a large, traditional Grimaldi's pizza with onions, garlic and jalapenos ($15 + $2 per topping = $21). As we wait for our pizza, a quick survey of the pizzas on other customers' tables make me a little nervous that the coal-brick-oven at Grimaldi's is over-baking their crust. Every pizza I see in the restaurant has dark-brown/black burnt crust edges. (Thinking that it will take a really resilient dough recipe to withstand that level of scorching, I will be very impressed if their crust is actually chewy/crispy!)  Our pizza shows up. The cheese looks great - it has that stark white color of good Buffalo mozzarella. Bonus fresh basil in the middle of the pizza! No visible grease puddles on or under pizza! Overall the topping quantity isn't terribly generous, but compared to Settebello's 'authentic' (i.e. totally skimpy) pizza topping distribution, I find no reason to complain. With the first bite of any thin crust pizza, I pray to the pizza gods that the crust will be perfectly 50% crispy and 50% chewy. Unfortunately, Grimaldi's crust is 80% crispy and 20% chewy, and by the time the pizza is half eaten (4 slices left) it stales and becomes 100% crispy, much like the crust texture of a Tombstone frozen pizza. How did this happen?!  The edge of the crust is unacceptably crunchy and flavorless (and burnt!) and the second half of the pizza left me wondering what went wrong with this pizza - how does a pizza crust take a total turn for the worse after only 10 minutes into a meal? We could have easily left 2 pieces for a togo box for next-day's lunch, but found ourselves in a better-eat-it-now-because-it-will-get-stale situation as the crust was already surprisingly stiff. I actually heard the crust *snap* all way down the middle when folding the last slice!   My favorite pizza experiences in North America have included a few special pies at Lou Malnati's (Chicago), Pizzeria Bianco (Phoenix), John's Pizzeria (NYC), Frank Pepe's (New Haven) and Pizzeria Rustica (Miami). In Vegas I have had good luck at Metro Pizza and at Rocco's NY Pizzeria, and the pear/gorgonzola/arugula/proscuitto pizza at the Sammy's location on Sahara is a consistently tasty choice. With respect to Grimaldi's, I could say \"maybe we got a bad pie\" but judging from the dozen other over-baked pizzas I saw on customers' tables, I think a baking-time or yeast adjustment could really help - the flavor is all there - the crust just needs a little chewy tweaking! Service is friendly and very attentive. Apparently, the cheesecake at Grimaldi's is homemade and as good as NYC Stage Deli's...",

    "text": "So Ive had to ponder this review for a few days as Im conflicted. In all fairness this is by far the best pizza Ive had since moving to Las Vegas over a year ago. When I first moved here I ate at a new pizza joint every week in hopes of finding a good slice.  I finally found a great slice made in Vegas and Ive eaten at three of their locations now and the pizza has never disappointed.  That being said I did find a big hunk of metal in my salad. I want to give them negative stars for that alone but I love their pizza so much I cant.   What I can say is that the manager came over and told me the salads were on the house and helped me fill out their incident report. I was physically fine and just lucky I hadn't swallowed it as I was thinking it was an olive pit.   We were happy with that but 10 minutes later the owner came over to make sure I was OK and said the entire meal was on him and that we should have desert as well.  Just to show you how much I love this pizza we couldn't take him up on the offer as we were all stuffed.  Ok so outside of the Salad the Pizza was coal fired perfection and the owner/staff made the entire experience top notch and you shouldn't be afraid to try them out.  I know the price can freak you out but its worth every penny.  A break down of our experience here would be:  Salad 1 out of 5 (explanation already given)  Pizza 4 out of 5 (half order of onions turned into light onions on entire pizza)  Management 8 out of 5 (after my last experience like this I have to say all crisis like this should be handled so professionally.  Wait staff 4 out of 5 (we had empty drinks on our table a lot and Im sure that was because she was to nervous to come back to the table. She did a great job besides the empty drinks and we did tip her a good amount even though we were eating for free.  I have to say give them a chance just be careful chewing the salad.",

    "text": "Our waiter asked if had ever been, we said no, and he said welcome to your new favorite pizza place.  holy crap, THE BEST THE BEST THE BEST This coming from someone who likes(... liked?) deep dish, grim serves east coast which is thin but the great thing about that is you can eat more! 3 of us polished a large, down to the last piece of chicken on the pan. The pies are cooked pretty hot so the crust is crunchy and delicious.  Its kinda expensive for the toppings though, i think the large was 15, but then you add each topping for about 2-6 dollars i think, the chicken was 5 i remember. We also got meatball. Fantastic.   Reminded me a lot of Chicago Brewing BUT SO MUCH BETTER. Its rather small on the inside but still looks classy, of course its boca park. Classic red and white checker tablecloths and a bar up front, BUT NO TVs which i actually liked here. Walls decorated with normal new york / italian gear. Didnt see anything yankee which was funny, its like they dont want to be a sports bar (for which i would go to gordon anyway) but they are big on wines, and in a very italian restaurant fashion wine glasses are waiting on the tables for you  Will have to try dessert next time we didnt even look. We did get a caprese salad to start which was very elegant, but to me it was a waste of 7 bucks for cheese and tomato.   All i could say while eating was \"this is freaking good!\"  Uploading a picture of their lighting, its emptied out wine bottles hanging from the ceiling, almost didnt notice these gems!  5 STARS for food and not being snooty, but it is clean and new so dress up a lil, makes you feel better anyway  EDIT!! idk how i could have forgotten to mention this. I came in alone and asked for a table for 3, the 2 hostesses kinda looked at me and i explained that an old man and little girl would be joining me. One asked if she needed to bring a booster seat. The funny part is the 'little girl' is my 20 yr old sister so I awkwardly let them know she wasn't a 'little girl' but rather my little sister, who happens to be very short... haha, and will always be little to me ;)",

    "text": "I finally got a chance to try the coveted Grimaldi's pizza  (on my birthday, of all days) for lunch. It's conveniently located near my favorite coffee shop so why not I said?  The first thing you'll notice is how neat it looks inside. Wine bottle chandeliers, and various accouterments adorning the walls. They have a rather odd business model. The base pizza includes dough and sauce. Yes that's right...cheese is a topping. Rather silly way to justify charging more money to your customers. I would have preferred to pay the same amount with the cheese built into the base price of the pizza-- at least I wouldn't have felt my intelligence was being insulted. Although I suppose it's possible that there might be some lactose intolerant customers who take advantage of this opportunity not to have cheese on their pizza...  Anyway you'll also find that the price starts to rack up rather quickly as you begin adding toppings to your creation, which you'll simply have to do at a place like this. We chose mushrooms, meatballs, and pepperoni. The quality of the ingredients is apparent. The meatballs were juicy and flavorful and definitely not frozen crap that came out of a factory. The tomatoes of the sauce are allegedly organic and I did find the sauce to be full flavored. The mushrooms are also a tasty, chewy delight. The cheese takes some getting used to. Ricotta as a pizza cheese is definitely an unusual choice but I did enjoy the meal over all. The lack of grease is a plus. I also really liked the way you can watch them put it all together. The pepperoni had a kick to it and seemed to be something you might find at a nice Italian deli rather than a Pizza hut.  The originality of this place, combined with the quality of ingredients, will certainly merit a return from me, but it falls short of a five star experience.",

I have eaten at the Grimaldi's in Brooklyn New York and that was amazing as well, and there is no noticeable difference between that location and ours! Anyone giving this place negative reviews on the food knows nothing about real pizza... or should get their head examined ;-)  It is a little pricey I admit, and the toppings really rack up the bill if you add a lot on. But its so good it really is worth every penny. If you want to be cheap and save some money, you will probably find yourself eating that garbage Pizza hut or dominoes serves. Grimaldi's is the real deal.  P.S. No time to dine in? Call ahead and pick up.",

    "text": "Went to Grimaldi's Pizzeria for a friend's birthday.  We arrived relatively early for dinner and seating was not an issue, compared to the tougher task of finding a parking space not too far from the restaurant.  We ordered an antipasto course, which I though was good, but not exceptional.  We also ordered 2 medium pizza, with each half having different combination of toppings for more variety.  I like the thin and crispy pizza crust that is served here, which is not greasy like those served at some other pizzerias.  Overall the dining experience was A-OK!  The price of the bill was reasonable, especially for being in the more upscale Boca Park area of town.  However, it is also one of the more memorable dining experience for us, since one of the ladies in our party was apparently hit on while we were waiting for our drinks and appetizers to arrived by a totally random but well dress man.  And of all the topics to use to start the conversation, it was about carpal tunnel surgery (because her arm is still in a sling).  This carried on for about 5 minutes, before we realized that he is one of the FOH managers of the restaurant.  Anyway, he came back several times to check up on us, and also to correct a mistake in our bill (we ordered 2 medium pizzas, but one of them was accidentally written as a large).   I would recommend this place for a casual get together, especially before or after shopping at Boca Park.",

The atmosphere is calm and quite, no one is overly loud or obnoxious either. But if you can always sit inside too if the weather is unbearable. There's a bar area for watching the game (and my boyfriend was glued to it, as always)  I've been here twice so far, and each time the service was great! They were attentive and watching to make sure our drinks were filled and to give my boyfriend and I updates on our foods. The second I came here the pizza I ordered took a little longer than my boyfriend's. They brought his out and mine took another 5-10 minutes longer. Normally I would've have been kinda peeved, but our server came by and apologized and even offered to reheat my boyfriend's pizza because he waited for mine to come! That's what I call quality service!  The pizza has super thin crust and I was skeptical at first but it really complimented the pizza. I got a personal pizza with sun dried tomatoes and roasted red bell peppers. I love that they use fresh mozzarella cheese!   I love it when service is great and knows how to \"entertain\" so to speak. He was likeable and funny and needless to say he got a nice tip from us.  This place is worth a shot if you like pizza that doesn't come in a box.",

Chad recommended adding the basil after the pizza has been cooked. I didn't even know you can ask it that way but I'm glad we went with his recommendation. The fresh basil made it great and the were very generous with the basil. Totally worth the visit. If you have room for dessert, try the cheesecakes; light and easy to eat.",

We all recieved a $5 gift card to use towards any additional purchase towards additional food and alcohol. The pizzas and cannolis we pigged out on were compliments of Grimaldi's.  We shared a small house salad while we were waiting for the pizzas and it was pretty huge for a small! The pizzas came out and we had 5 large pizzas-2 Cheese, 1 Sausage, 1 Pepperoni, and 1 White. This is not my favorite kinda pizza, but it was pretty decent. I personally prefer a more thicker, chewy crust like NY or Neapolitan style. Toppings were also pretty good, and my favorite one was the White Pizza.(Rocco's House White still gets my vote though). One of the managers later came out with a tray of Cannolis and said \"don't be shy\", so everyone had about 2 or 3 and there were still leftovers!  Service was awesome, and it was a great way to cap off a day of shopping local...ALOHA!!!",

The server comes over acts like it's totally our fault then says we will make a new one. Awesome!! BUT salad never comes out either... we wait a little longer and still no sight of salad so we finally ask and she's like oh I forget because I put it in fridge. Ok cool so bring it out no biggie. Finally get the correct pizza but took so long we had to box it up and go because kids were getting tired. Server hands us bill and does not take care of anything not the pizza that they got wrong... they didn't take off the salad that never came until we asked.. no apology for what happened. We never got one refill on our drinks either. Now looking back our server had a big area to cover and it felt like they were understaffed. So I do give sympathy for that situation BUT we just feel like the amazing quality and happy vibes we got from this place is gone. Sadly we may have to find a new weekly pizza joint.",

How lazy are you?  Not to mention YOURE NOT HANDICAPPED!  Save front spots for patrons.  Not to mention a HANDICAP spot!  Really!?  It's a rainy Wednesday morning at 9:45am. Save that handicap spot for a person who needs it!  Sorry I'm just so annoyed at that!  My mom can hardly walk with a double hip replacement ESP in this weather she is in awful pain...and a capable employee is gonna park there!  Ok that's my rant!",

My group and I sat outside by the patio railing. The night was beautiful with a small breeze, the water fountain outside by the patio should be turned off on light wind days, got a little splash as it turns on and off. Not sure if that a mechanism that's in place on windy days. Ordered the cesar salad, the Don and Marharita pizza all food items were great. The disappointment I had was the limited draft beer selection, the only beer on draft was Sam Adams seasonal and others I don't remember. I wanted a Bud light or Stela but they did not have either selection. I went on a Wednesday, I would understand if it were the weekend but I believe the management failed to order supplies. I was hoping the waitress would have informed the manager but she did not come to my table. I was disappointed that this was ignored and I did not feel the waitress should stand there and explain the lack of product. I will probably go one more time and give it a chance but will not go again after that if I run into a similar issue.",

Positives: - Good pizza.  Nothing spectacular - NOT Deep dish.   - Split between me and my hungry boyfriend... perfect size for 2  Mediterranean salad:  - Pretty fresh, some of the pieces of lettuce were wilted and red...  - split for 2 people is a good appetizer if you're not starving.

Pro tip: We always order the crust well done because it has a tendency to get soggy in the middle.  And if you're in the mood for a refreshing drink, you can't go wrong with either the white or red sangria.   For an appetizer, we stick to the caprese, simple but delicious. I am disappointed that the mozzarella slices have gotten smaller over time and isn't proportionate to the tomato and basil.   My cousin who lives in New York always raved about Grimaldi's and how the line would wrap around the block. Glad the line doesn't do that in Vegas, but I'd totally wait!",

    "text": "Delicious pizza and great service too! My girl and I went here to sit down and have a pizza. It was our first time here. This place looks nice inside, brick walls and has a very tall ceiling. We ordered the Caesar Salad and a large pizza with sausage, pepperoni and red peppers.   Tip: The \"small\" salad size is big enough for two people to have one serving of salad. We got the \"large\" size salad and it was enough for 4 people. The way the pizza works is they have a set price for the sizes (small, medium, large) and then each of your toppings cost extra. But the toppings can get pretty expensive. So essentially for a large I think it was $16. And that is just the crust and sauce. We then added sausage, pepperoni and red peppers and I think our pizza alone came out to $24. So you can see that if you start adding lots of toppings the pizza will get quite expensive.   The pizza was delicious. Pepperoni was so good and so was the sausage. Had a nice little spice to it. My only complaint (and this isn't the restaurant's fault) is that I like the crust to be a tad bit thicker so I can hold the pizza slice by the crust and have the slice stick straight out. This crust is very thin so if you hold it by the crust the entire slice bends down to the ground.   Our server, Daniel was very good. He was working the bar as well as our tables.",

As another reviewer pointed out, the first slice was the best; Grimaldi's really needs to invest in some kind of serving plate that does a better job (or any job) of keeping the pie warm.  Pizza was just what you want from a thin-crust style, however incredibly, and I mean INCREDIBLY under-seasoned.  Even with the visible garlic on it, we still needed to douse ours with extra garlic powder, cheese, oregano, red pepper flakes and whatever other seasoning we could find.  Only then was the seasoning adequate.    My wife and I did finish the whole pie, but the last slices were sadly cold, and my wife pointed out as well that there were bare patches on the pie where there was nothing: no cheese, sauce or toppings.  That is a cardinal sin in our opinion.    Had cannoli for dessert, they were quite good.",

    "text": "While visiting Vegas this week, we were desperate for a good wood-fired style pizza and yelp reviewers helped us out and came through with accurate descriptions and were right-on with quality.  Needless to say, coal-fired pizza is now our new favorite.  Initially we drove from the strip out to S. Rampart to get away from the congestion.  To our dismay, they said they had to clean the ovens (before the dinner rush hour) and we walked out totally disappointed.  Not 30 seconds later, waiter Moe, comes running out and says they can hold off with cleaning after our pizza.  Nowhere else would I have ever experienced someone who really understood and cared enough to do that.  Anyone else would have shrugged their shoulders and said \"oh well\".   We ordered the roma tomato, fresh mozarella, and basil pizza.  Any other Margherita type pizzas are scarce with all their ingredients, but not this one.  I couldn't believe how it was made with the eater in mind.  A bite of everything in every bite.  No skimping on their end.  We also ordered the caprese salad for an appetizer and it was outstanding, in flavor, presentation and portion size.  The moz they import from NY is so fresh and tender.    We will definitely be back on our next visit to LV.   Now we go back to VA where I have to drive 45 minutes for our second favorite pizza, wood-fired grilled.   Thanks Grimaldi's on S Rampart and thanks Yelp reviewers of all the Grimaldi locations for leading us to a great find!  NQ",

    "text": "This is our favorite pizza spot. The salads are large enough to share, the pizza crust is thin crust and perfect to be able to enjoy the rest of the pizza no matter what toppings you decide on.  We don't particularly enjoy getting so full on pizza dough itself when it's so thick!  We usually get the pepperoni and italian sausage with half ricotta (Love the taste and texture here) and fresh basil after it comes out of the oven.  For 2 of us, a small is actually perfect size because there is room for dessert.  Haven't tried all of them, but the desserts we have had were also yummy.  Our regular go to place for pizza.  Wish they had a location near Aliante! We've done takeout, but best if you can eat it right when it comes out of the oven fresh. The staff is constantly re-filling our drinks and courteous.",

The decor is really nice with the old wine bottles pretending to be chandeliers.  It's a lot bigger than would appear.  Me and the little sis had the usually sausage and mushroom and it was really good.  Seriously if your looking for a good pizza place with a good patio this is the place.

    "text": "We stopped by for lunch after many recommendations from friends. Ramiro is always comparing NY pizza to local pizza and is never satisfied with local. But for once he said this pizza was comparable to a NY pizza, he loved that you could taste the freshness in the sauce and the cheese was also great.   I completely agree with his assessment but feel that the sauce although very fresh was lacking in spice/flavor. In addition, there was very little of it on the pizza to the point I had to request additional.   But that was my only disappointment and wouldn't make it a deal breaker as it was very tasty, ya just gotta make sure to order extra sauce.   So we will definitely be back, especially since I saw they had a meatball pizza that looks so good and I can't wait to try it.",

Not as scenic as the Brooklyn bridge location (you do get a cute fountain in front and there's outdoor patio seating), but it's soooo close to home! I don't have to fly to NYC to have Grimaldi's. And there's NO 1-hour wait outside (although I think the long wait and the crowded & tight dining area in NYC made the experience more authentic). My advice: eat there, don't take it to-go. The pizza tastes so much better fresh from the oven. I didn't try it at this location but the house red wine in NYC was deelish! don't forget XTRA GARLIC!",

    "text": "6/4/2012 Got table blocked right off the bat. Told hostess we needed a table for 3 outside headed out and noticed another group closely following then some confusion as they said they were waiting before us so host gave to them. Waited for party to leave so we could get next one. Waiter never came back to get their check lol they ended up annoyed and came in to pay. Fronts horribly managed.  Sat us at a 2 person table...? Not enough room. Had to ask to be moved. Everything seemed to be fine... at first. They were literally falling all over themselves to help us with drinks etc. Had 3 different servers tell us about the pizzas there and ask us for drink order. Was kind of comical. Pizza came and was good... Our neighboring table that backed up to the wall seemed to be having some sort of issue and the man there jumped up abruptly and then the woman he was eating with did the same. Thought they were fighting... that was until I noticed some visitors on their table. Yes ON their table. That's when we also saw them. It seems Boca park has a rather severe roach problem. We immediately stopped eating when we saw they were scattering less than a foot away from our table and not one or two mind you... Dozens of them were crawling in the bushes and along the wall. I could have and at one point was leaning on that wall. Thankfully they didn't crawl onto our table, our neighbors were't as lucky as one dashed right in there while they were eating.  Told the waitress as we abruptly moved away from the wall. She said they knew... and it was a problem they were having.  The manager came out who was extremely nice and admitted it was a problem and they had to spray several times a week and was going to start spraying everyday. gag! He gave us a discount. It actually read \"roaches\" under the reason for the discount. I wish I were kidding... If it's that bad outside what does the kitchen look like? Here's a tip... when you have a roach infestation don't sit diners right next to it. We took our pizza home but now we are wondering why we even paid for the meal. None of us want to eat it. lol Nasty as hell. Won't ever be back. Part 2... Looks like I'm getting some hate mail from .. employees? or overly ardent Grimaldi lovers? lol They must really love that pizza! Pathetic. Now you are just riling me. I was willing to let this go and never go back... but not now. This is a review site! We had a bad experience. I'm going to write about it! There are roaches there ... outside yes, but the problem is extreme. I grew up here. I know there are roaches outside. This is pretty damn bad or else it wouldn't have been mentioned. No \"Gecko's on a patio\" but then again, that might help them solve their roach problem. I'm not trying to \"ruin the reputation of a restaruarnt,\" (and yes they spelled it wrong, that's a direct quote.) I do have the receipt... would you like me to post it showing the reason, \"roaches\" on the there? It was so bad they have a discount called \"roaches\" in their system. lol It's time they do something about it. When a problem is that severe you don't sit people there! Period. And if its that bad outside I wonder what the kitchen looks like... I'd be MORE than happy to learn that they've taken steps to correct this little black crawly issue and I would LOVE to post that its been fixed on here for all to see... yet no one has contacted me other than really angry pizza lovers. Crazy. Maybe we can just solve this and have the health department come out and take a look. If they don't think its a problem then hey no worries! Cheers!",

We went to the pumpkin patch there with the kids and noticed the place. I was SOOO HAPPY when I looked the place up and it was indeed the same like the one in NY. We returned here for lunch and gosh was it amazing... my 1.5 year old had two slices by herself :)  It is the same taste like the NY Grimaldi - I used to go to the original one in soho all the time.  The cheesecake was delicious too. I'm happy and satisfied with the meal and I will definitely only get pizza from here going forward. Thank you, Grimaldi's!!",

It's one of my favorite deals.  Menu has a couple of salads (I prefer the Mediterranean) and apps, and you build your own pizza- pick a size and a sauce, then add on your toppings. So far, I've only had the red sauce but I like that they have a pesto available. The large pizza is enormous and their suggestion that it feeds 3-4 people is accurate. Something about the crust and sauce just didn't do it for me- it's good but not great, something was missing and we added a lot of the garlic. While I'm a fan and will come back, the pricing keeps me from returning regularly- it's pretty steep and considering the $3-5 per topping fee, they were pretty light.   Heads up, their pizza oven is unavailable at certain times- they have a \"stoking hour\" (4-6PM?) to reset the oven and pies are delayed, but there are drink and app discounts.",

After browsing the menu we selected a 1/2 Quatro Fromaggio and 1/2  Garden large 18\" pizza. At first I thought would this be enough to feed the entire fam. Boy was I wrong.    Pizza came out quickly to the table.  First the crust was thin and crispy from the coal heated brick oven.  It was crisy, delicious and flavorful from the way they cook their pizzas. I prefer a bit more cheese on my pizzas but the toppings were distributed evenly for a consistent flavor throughout.  The entire family was completely satisfied with this pie. This is one of the better pizzas I've had in Vegas so far and I'm looking to try another one of their specialty pizzas. The prices on the BYO pizzas could get pretty expensive with $2 to $4 each add on ingredient. Ouch!  Grimaldi's has a decent craft beer selection like Lagunitas, Dale's, and Green Flash.  Prices are reasonable, however they do not offer any happy hour specials.  On Tuesday they do offer 1/2 off glass and bottles of wine.",

Had them add salami and mozzarella.  Delicious!  Pizzas were amazing!  Love, love the crust.  No complaints whatsoever with food however the service was not great.  Not horrible but the place was definitely not packed with maybe just a few tables.  Had to get up and find waiter to refill drinks after watching for him to come around for a while.  Will definitely go back for the food they just need to sharpen up on service even in the slower times of the day!",

We got a small pepperoni and it was big enough for two people. It was really good the pepperoni was a little spicy not hot just had a kick to it and it was very delicious. The place is always supper busy so we just took the pizza to go.",

    "text": "I have now eaten at Grimaldi's several times now at different locations, but my home is closest to this one so I have done a mix of take out and delivery via DoorDash from here.  When I imagine my perfect NY style pizza, it is pretty much this. Crispy crust, sweet sauce, stretchy mozzarella, and thin crust. It goes down very smooth, and I can pretty much eat this every day and be happy. Short of going to New York, you will be hard pressed to find a better rendition. The toppings here are on point too. I have had the mushrooms and Italian sausage and both are great. Plus I have tried the Oreo Cheesecake and that was also excellent.  It will be difficult for me to go and try another pizza place here in Vegas because I'm so pleased with this one. This from a guy that has probably baked around 100 Neapolitan style pizzas at home over the past 2 years using baking steel and following a hybrid of Jeff Varasano's recipe combined with Serious Eats Pizza Hack. I will still bake some pies myself, but for convenience Grimaldi's will be my go-to spot for quality pizza.",

Not sure if they notice all the places closing down around them in this shopping center, but they better figure out how to do things alot better. Luckily there is a really good new pizza place that just recently opened in the same plaza. Adios Grimaldi's.",

We always had great management, bartenders (Keith), and waitresses.  Went last Wednesday evening.  Too bad the Health Inspectors were not there.  There was no soap in the family bathroom. I told an employee and our waitress.  I was told by one (not our waitress, she was awesome), just go to another bathroom. He was not going to even fix it.  It just needed a battery.  So, people are just walking in and out of the bathroom without washing hands.  Gross!!!!     Told our amazing waitress.  She went to her manager.  Manager did not even come and talk to us.  Eventually rectified the situation and the manager did not even have the decency to let us know it was taken care of (she asked the waitress to tell us).  What ever happened to customer service.        Not done...The whole area where the pizzas are made (it is an open area) was taken apart.  All of the compartments were taken out and it was a disaster.  Not sure why.  This is at 7:30 or so in the evening.  Why???  We had our pizza.  Awful!!  It was not cooked completely and was such poor quality. No toppings.   I don't think I can ever go back.  Just can't  do it!!!          We had not gone back for some time...management always took care of us. We all make mistakes...just fix it.   This establishment was always so busy.  Every time we go now it is pretty much empty. We now know why.  Since we were regulars, I feel confident in saying what I am saying.   I will not be back. It really is too bad.  It was such an amazing place.  I do not see it making it in Summerlin; unless they get their act together.",

This is a great place for a 21 year old guy to to take his 19 year old date, who he's trying to impress, by ordeing wine with Pizza, and letting her sneak sips of it.   Pizza is really hyped and not that good. Certainly, over priced. Long wait, and very arrogant staff.   Went with my then, Hipster Son, and his girl friend. They were impressed, I was not.  I ordered a Sausage Pizza, with double meat. Looks like they were running out of Sausage, and barely sprinkled the pizza. When I complained, the waiter just said, \"That's how it is\".   I would have been better off ordering a Pizza to go from Costco.   Never again!!",

Never been much of a pizza bloke as I felt being full by of average crusts and semi cold delivered pizza from the big boys of Pizza, Pizza Hut etc wasn't really healthy or satisfying.  Situated in Boca park next to Cheesecake Factory, Embers and Kona Grill. grimaldi's has a great layout with stool style seating, sit down dining area and a small patio area out the front to boot. The pizza is a Coal Brick oven style that unlike a lot of other places sets up for topping priority tasting dish.  Having been here a few times I've always found the Antipasti a great starter with a nice serving of bread with olive oil and vinegar.  Ordering a Sausage, Pepperoni, Ricotta cheese pizza, the medium size pizza was enough for 3 people easy. Presentation is always top notch and competes with most pizza joints locally.  The service here is prompt but also it can be sometimes a little wait to get a table as it's always fairly busy most day/nights of the week.   One of the only cons is even though they had high chairs for children, the menu didn't really have much flexibility for what the little ones can be served. I asked if they had a pasta dish that could be served in a smaller portion but the server pretty much nix anything that was asked..",

I don't usually eat the crust yet I look forward to Grimaldi's! The sauce is fresh and flavorful. The cheese is sliced fresh mozzarella. Combine all this and it makes my mouth water. The toppings makes a perfect pizza out of this world! I hope one day Grimaldi's comes to California until then I look forward to visiting them whenever I'm in Las Vegas.   Ambiance is very New York style. The service is excellent. Prices are decent though if you're not careful, it can become expensive.  Pizza!",

Adriana and I were staying at the Wynn to celebrate our anniversary, and we opted for Grimaldi's on our first night there, just because we had such a good experience when we were in town last year, and we were exhausted from the 45 minute flight from Burbank.   A Lego Store just opened next door, so K'ayum was already in heaven. We scored the last outside table. (OK, not outside, 'cause you're in a mall, but outside the restaurant. Got it?)  Perfect for people-watching.  I ordered a carafe of chianti, and the friendly waitress even scared up an ice bucket to chill it a bit. We started with a small spinach salad  (I, Christopher C., ALWAYS start with a salad) and it was excellent and enough for the three of us to share.   For a pizza, we opted for pepperoni, spicy chicken sausage, onions, and peppers. The pizza was incredible -  the sausage was nice and spicy and the crust was perfect. It was a great meal, and my son scored a great Lego set! (Note to self: go to Lego store BEFORE consuming a carafe of wine...)   I hear there's a location in Southern California - I'm going to have to look that up! But then again, Grimaldi's is a PERFECT excuse for a Vegas road trip...",

To my disappointment I did not get the $4 chicken on my salad I paid for. Don't get me wrong, I am in the service industry and get mistakes happen. And its also not a huge deal, just drove me crazy from a service standpoint. REGARDLESS, I will still be back. Just a suggestion, maybe check your to-go orders before sending them on their merry way!",

    "text": "The BF and I came after a beer festival and needed something comforting to sop up the boozing.   We ordered a small caesar salad to start. I normally don't go for a caesar salad except when there is a possibility to have it with anchovies. Squeeze a little lemon on the anchovies, some crunchy romaine with creamy dressing is my idea of a comfort salad. I'm \"weird\", but you do know that is what a legit caesar dressing is made of.   We got a thin crust mushroom pizza and the crust was pretty crispy and light throughout.   Service at this location was friendly, funny, and attentive on drinks and checking if we need anything.   For a chain pizza, I think Grimaldi's is pretty good and has been solid every location I've been to.",

Typically the first time I try a pizza joint I go with just straight pepperoni, this time was no exception. I always feel that if a place can get the basics right then I am willing to venture out and try something a little more.... exotic.  The crust was good, the cheese very good, not much in the way of sauce. Worth trying however I still prefer chicago style pizza. If it is't cut in squares, it isn't pizza:)",

First the Romaine in the Caesar Salad was bitter, according to my wife and kids.  The pizza we ordered came out wrong after waiting 45 minutes.  The manager came over and offered to remake the pizza and a free desert for our inconvenience.  The first pizza was on them, so to help with my starvation I dug into the first piece with a huge disappointment.  My wife was already upset with me as I complained about the pizza being wrong in the first place, so for a moment I held back giving her my thoughts of that first bite.  I couldn't take it after the second bite and told her my thoughts.  She agreed.  I thought maybe the second pizza would be better. It wasn't.   Not only this but it took forever to get the bill and pay.  I will not be returning anytime soon, if at all.",

While we were greeted by a very friendly, helpful hostess, our waiter left much to be desired. It took 15 minutes of being seated before getting any service and the place wasn't crowded.   As far as the food goes, that fell short of my expectations as well. We ordered a large artichoke, sun-dried tomato and grilled chicken white pizza. I might be biased because I'm not a total fan of thin crust but it's not offensive to me but, when we received our order, the whole pizza was burnt. Definitely not worth what we paid for it.   Overall, I'd probably give this place another try because I believe that sometimes you get an \"off\" experience and I think Grimaldi's definitely has potential. The patio is very nice for people watching and I think it's a good place to come for lunch, especially now that warmer temperatures are upon us.",

One of the most lauded pizza joints in New York City, they appeared to have branched out - franchising 2 joints in Las Vegas  So, after much anticipation, my hubby and I bit the bullet and went for a piece of pie.  Meh. Really. The pizza was not as flavourful as what we expected. We had the marinara (tinned, pureed tomatoes) sauce with sausage, basil and onions. The lack of spice of the sauce and the sausage was  a total downer. The small amount of basil they did put on the pizza did nothing to detract from the overall blandness of the poor pie. Which was rather sad because the crust is one of the best we've tried.  We did go back to try Grimaldi's a second time - this time opting for a \"white\" sauce with meatball and onions. Still, the food was rather bland. Our server this time did bring us some dried oregano and garlic powder which we doused the poor slices with to give it some flavour.  Really, for the food alone, it does probably deserve maybe a three star rating. However the cost of the pizza detracted me from doing so.",

And only about 1/3rd of the tables were full. Ordered a small simple 2 ingredient pizza which tasted pretty good, but had to wait 45 mins for it to come. Keep in mind that these brick oven pizzas, with the extreme heat and as thin as they are, cook in about 6-7 mins.  No complaints about the quality of the food, but the unexplained wait for no reason and worst service in yrs means I can only give 2 stars for this particular location.",

I usually prefer thick crust (I'm a big fan of bread), but this thin crust was great and I would definitely come back for more. We also ordered the dessert trio with the cannoli, tiramisu and New York cheesecake. The cannoli was delicious. I've never had tiramisu before, so nothing to compare it to, but it was good. The cheesecake wasn't what I expected; it was a lot lighter and fluffier than what I've normally had. It also came with a raspberry sauce, I believe, which I didn't care for. But I didn't come here for the cheesecake. Overall, the experience was great, the pizza was delicious, and i would absolutely return.",

A server brought out my salad first and when I asked where the other salad was she said its coming, I said I would wait and she asked if she should take it back till the other  salad was ready. I said No and waited for the other salad not very long but could not figure out why she did not bring both out. I had the Caesar and did not enjoy it. First it came in a bowl that reminded me of a cereal bowl and not very flavorful.. I even asked for more dressing and still seem blah.  The pizza which I had heard is awesome was not. First you order the size and crust style then the toppings which cost 2 to 3 dollars apiece. The crust which was thin which I like was chewy.  Overall with 1 glass of wine, a half carfare of wine, pizza and 2 salads the bill was $60.00. I will say the service was above average and the manager a nice lady came by to check on us, made the service experience good.",

    "text": "My wife and I were very excited when Grimaldi's Pizzeria opened their location in Boca Park. We have gone there several times since they opened and to say our experience has been a mixed bag is an understatement. Over time we have become dyed in the wool pizza snobs. We look for the best pizza where ever we travel and have learned a lot about what goes into a great pie. We especially like wood and coal fired oven pizzas so we knew Grimaldi's would be right up our alley.  I've had a few very good pies at Grimaldi's and I've had a couple of questionable experiences.    On our first couple of trips to Grimaldi's we ordered pepperoni pizza and wine. The pies were well made with a nice char on the crust as one would expect from a coal fired pizza. The service was quick and very friendly. We were definitely satisfied with our visits early on. On a subsequent visit things got a little funny. We hadn't tried a margherita style pizza at Grimaldi's so we decided that that would be the order of the day. Now mind you the Vegas location doesn't have margherita as choice on their menu, but it's a pretty simple traditional pie. It's just sauce, mozzarella and basil. Pretty straight forward, right? So I thought. Upon asking for a margherita pizza I was given an explanation about east coast margherita vs. west coast margherita and how each is made. His whole east coast/ west coast thing made me forget we were discussing pizza and had me believing the conversation had turned to hip-hop music. East coast/ west coast? Really??!! It was obvious that instead of telling me he didn't know what a margherita pizza our server wanted to b.s. me. At this point he suggested that we try both pies. Against my better judgment I went along with him. Needless to say, both pies were wrong. The most interesting of the two pies was the east coast pie which did have basil on it: about $40 worth! Since that experience I have made a trip to Brooklyn and went to the original Grimaldi's where they knew exactly what a Margherita pizza is. Must be some sort of disconnect between the mothership and franchises.    With all of that being said Grimaldi's does serve a good pie and is worth the trip. The serve is always good and the wine list has some nice choices as well. Just remember, if you want a margherita pizza write down the instructions on how it's made! East coast or west coast!!",

The only down side: the pizza cools down VERY fast... so if you live more than 10 minutes away, forget it!  Just sit down inside!  2. If you go to their website and sign up for their mailing list, they will give you $5 off your next dine-in visit.  Definitely worth putting your email address in... and you don't get slammed with stuff.  I haven't received anything from them, besides the $5 off coupon.",

    "text": "I know I'm hard on pizzerias. I'm gonna preface my review by saying this; Grimaldi's is... different. I don't mean it's a bad place; it's actually a really good pizzeria. It's just coal fire pizza. That's not something I'm particularly accustomed to. It is however not a bad approach. I'll always be a diehard brick oven proponent. To a pizza maker/connoisseur, it's more drastic than a Pepsi vs. Coke argument. It's more like Charcoal vs. Gas grills, American vs Foreign cars, Macs vs. PCs, or Revolvers vs. Semi-Auto pistols. It's just a fundamentally different approach. But I can actually appreciate it for what it is.   The decor is nice and classy for a pizzeria. Like a more upscale old school NY pizza joint. The quality of ingredients are high. I order different things now and then. I really like the meatball and ricotta toppings. Being coal oven pizza, you still get a pretty crispy pie. Sometimes, the crust is too crispy though, even for me. And since this is all the nature of the beast with coal ovens, the toppings aren't always piping hot. But it all has a really good flavor to it. And the service is outstanding. If you sit at the bar you might have Audrey serving you. She's a good friend, and she's pretty awesome. Tell her I sent you, if she's there when you go. The manager is pretty cool too! I would definitely recommend giving this place a try, if you have any interest in pizza whatsoever. If you are diehard like me, and from back east... you may be more critical. Just look at it as something a little different and appreciate it for what it is. You might actually love it. I've put it in my pizza rotation, and I think that says a lot. Oh and by the way, they unfortunately don't deliver.",

We never made it to the bridge let alone across so this was a treat to see when I saw the sign for it in vegas.   I was waiting for the right time, one of those days where you're bored at home, want to do something but don't want to go out. A stop into here to place a to-go order, a small white garlic sauce pizza with Italian sausage and roasted red peppers came to a price tag of 23.xx   When I got back four people had at it, and everyone enjoyed the pizza.  Little pricey, the staff I interacted with were nice and helpful explaining that everything on the menu is chose your own toppings, they dont have pre-set, pre-defined 'specials'. For half the world who can't order except by combos and numbers I know this will be hard, but use your imagination -- have fun with it :)",

I really don't see what all the hype is about though. It's a good pizza, but far from the best in Vegas. The sauce was a bit too sweet, but the pie was solid otherwise.  The atmosphere in the restaurant is very nice. I especially like the black and white photos of New York on the walls, which match the decor perfectly and really add to the authenticity of the place.  Like I said, it's a good pizza. I'll come back to Grimaldi's, I'm sure, but I won't hype it up to my friends for fear of them leaving disappointed.",

After getting lost (Since we only moved here  months ago) we found this gem, its located in a great area and my son loved the fountain. We were greeted by 2 nice girls who seated us quickly. They gave my son a ball of dough and away he went throwing it in the air like the pizza makers. Our server was very nice and took our order, which only took about 10 minutes to get.  The pizza wasnt pipping hot, but luke warm, which was ok for my son but I wouldve rather it be warmer. I love the cheese on the pizza and the sausage was yummy. We added Parmesan cheese to the top, which made it suuuper yummy! Overall the whole experience was good, the pizza was good and the service was nice. We only ended up paying 2 dollars plus tip for a large 2 topping pizza (because of the bday coupon) so thats always a plus!!",

We ordered a half and half.  One of my favorite toppings was not available (pineapple ).  Toppings ordered on one side wound up on the other half.  Every single slice.  If there was a food allergy, one of us would have been in trouble.   The crust was partially burnt on the edges.  We've had better pizza at a different restaurant,  and considering this was the specialty the pizza was overall  disappointing.   The manager was apologetic about the sloppiness and offered to make an individual pizza so ingredients wouldn't \"hop around\", but by then we were ready to leave.  Quite simply,  if you can't handle half and half on one without it being a sloppy mess then don't offer that option.  The indifferent attitude of the pizza server added to the annoyance.  Again, if the ingredients \"hop around\" it's because the pizza is being thrown together and not given adequate  care during the preparation!   The manager did discount the bill for the unwanted portion.",

The crust is tasty and not too thick.  Their service is also top notch. On my last visit, by mistake I ordered a larger pizza than I usually get. It was my fault but after I asked why the amount was larger than expected they lowered the bill to the price of the smaller pizza even though I still got the one I ordered.  Parking can be an issue there on busy nights so if you do a pick-up order look for the specially marked spots right up front for Grimaldi's pick-up orders.",

He took the time to explain the menu, gave us a \"first-timer\" complimentary cheesecake, - which is to die for! The manager gave us a card for a complimentary salad on our next visit, which we will definitely take advantage of. Ordered the chopped kale salad and traditional pizza...sooooo good.

We typically don't go out for pizza often (we make our own) but I had received a free 16in one topping pizza coupon for my birthday so why not.  We arrived a little before 5pm on a Friday.  They informed us that the ovens had just been something (not sure what they called it but I took it as cleaned and heating back up) but wait time for pizzas to come out was minimal.  They brought out the first pizza but apologized and said another was in the oven because the one they brought out was a little darker than they liked but we could enjoy it and a better one would be on the way (it really wasn't burnt people).  We take a bite and after bite #2, I told E I would NEVER pay $20 for this.  They're insane.  He continued to eat.  I said ehhh no flavor.  This isn't good.  So I patiently waited for the second one to come out.  They again apologized and I dove in.  One bite.......HOLY COW!  I looked at E and said you've gotta try it.  He said how different can it be?  I'm full.  I said just take a bite of mine.  He ended up eating 2 more slices lol.  We will definitely splurge on ourselves for this delicious pizza.",

The past three times I've been there I've found bits of garlic in my food that aren't cooked and have a very harsh, bitter flavor. That really ruined the experience there for me and I won't be going back.",

Our server forgot to order our salad so it came out mid pizza eating and that's okay because as a server I totally get it, mistakes happen.. BUT it wasn't busy at all in the place and she wrote it down right aside our pizza order. Management comped it which was nice to do but the part I was really annoyed at was she went ahead and dropped the check WHILE WE WERE STILL EATING. Yes we asked for a box but no we did not ask for the check yet.   Aside from our server, I noticed the lady busser clean the tables in the most unprofessional way possible. She took the tablecloth, shook all the crumbs/trash on the ground then turned the tablecloth over and set the table just leaving everything on the floor under the table & on the booth. Are you serious? That can't be acceptable.. I do thank the food runner though (thank you!!), she seemed the most spunky and friendly out of everyone there!   Being in the F&B industry for 10 years maybe I critique a bit more but still, it'll be a while before returning to this location..",

The hostess was kind enough to inform us that they were stoking their oven, and it would be 40-45 minutes before our pizza would come out. No problem.  We ordered a antipasto plate, which was delicious. It had 8 think slices of buffalo mozzarella, a pile of sliced, marinated red pepper, 8 slices of salami, maybe a 10 pitless kalamata olives, like 6 pitless green olives, and maybe 10 slices of soft italian bread. It was accompanied with shakers of olive oil and baldaic vinegar. Delicious! The buffalo mozzarella was awesome, as was the entire plate. At $15, it wasn't exactly inexpensive for the amount of food included. But, the quality of the ingredients was excellent and well worth the cost.  Grimaldi's offers a coupon for a free 16\" birthday pizza (with one topping) to anyone who signs up for their online rewards program. We took advantage of their offer and ordered ours with ricotta cheese as our topping. WOW!!! I would say this has to be one of my all-time favorite pizzas (even though I wouldn't quite classify it as \"True\" New York pizza). The crust was thin and crispy. The sauce was sweet and flavorful. And, the pie had just the perfect balance of mozzarella and ricotta cheese. It was amazing.  The server and staff were both friendly and attentive.  We're look forward to our next visit!",

The cheese was also thin and placed oddly and it had no flavor . Sauce was super liquidity and made my pizza soggy.

The \"hand picked\" sausage provided the only mouthfeel substance but yet again failed to have even the slightest savory moment. I even wondered if I had a cold or allergies stifling my sense of taste but that's not the case.",

I noticed several of the wines at Grimaldi's that I had purchased before, all of them highly rated.    But the pizza. Idk.  It's good.  The toppings are good.  The sauce is good.  The crust is that thin crust, and theirs just isn't all that great to me.  I suppose that's it.  The crust.  I'm not a huge fan of that cracker crust. Or maybe I just wish theirs had more flavor because I have certainly enjoyed thin crust pizzas before.  I recalled being a bigger fan of Grimaldi's in the past.  It's kinda hard actually to articulate why Grimaldi's doesn't get 5-stars.  I think of other places that I've given 5-stars and Grimaldi's just doesn't wow me in anyway.  Everything is good, but nothing stands out.  I guess that's it.   My suggestion:  if you like thin crust pizza, then you can't go wrong with Grimaldi's.",

    "text": "Love this place. Some of the best pizza in Vegas.  Was surprised good pizza is hard to find in Vegas. They use water similar to NY water to make the crust, makes a big difference.  They also offer gluten free pizza in a 12 in pie.  I had the sausage and green peppers with extra mozzarella and it was yummy. Gluten free crust sucks, let's not kid, but if you have a good topping, it makes it tolerable. They have one of my favorite GF pizzas. Wife had a salami and black olive regular pizza with extra mozzarella and it was yummy. Salami is not on the list of toppings but they will put on the pizza if you ask.  Started with a small house salad, and it's enough for 2 to share. Comes with a mild house dressing, roasted red peppers and the usual salad things. Overall a nice meal, good service and highly recommended",

Her first taste of this restaurant was in Brooklyn, the original location, and she's been hooked since.   For two we ordered a large white pizza and added pepperoni, Italian sausage, and mushrooms. I love NY style thin crust pizza. With the large pizza we had plenty to eat and had a few slices to take home. They have a bunch of beers on draft and a few bottled beers as well. Overall we had a great experience, I would love to grab some pizza from Grimaldi's again soon.",

Things are definitely not the same.  We walked in and sat down at an empty bar.  The bartender was standing right in front of us wiping glasses.  She didn't greet us or look up.  When she did great us it was hardly a warm welcome.  The hostesses also seemed disorganized and confused.  When we arrived at our table our server was welcoming but also disorganized and confused.  Finally, the food was not as I remembered.  Let's say it was a disappointing experience.",

I was hooked and now that is a must order for me every time. This is very thin crust pizza cooked in a coal oven so it isn't what most people are used to and some may be disappointed if they are looking for more Chicago style pizza. I agree with the other posters that their non-pizza menu items are just ok, the salads are fairly plain and the desserts are just so-so but the pizza is fantastic. It could be a little cheaper but their price point is fair considering the portion size.",

The sauce was ok but just \"OK\". The cheese lacked flavor but was OK. And I ordered extra fresh garlic which they billed me twice for and was not fresh and there was not much there. I liked that they had a nice selection of beers on tap and some decent wine also. My mission was simple: to find the best NY thin crust pizza in Las Vegas and other places while I travel. I live in Vegas. So everytime I hear about a pizza joint that has good pie I write it down and try it out. I always order the pizza the same way and I never buy the pizza by the slice. This time this place set me back $45. I have still yet to find a better NY pizza than one made by Brian at NY PIZZA AND PASTA at Jones and Sahara. \" Thin crust all the way to the edge with Fresh garlic and pepperoni\".",

My husband and I love their pizza and don't eat pizza elsewhere, unless we really have to. The flavors are phenomenal. I do think, however, that the Eastern Avenue branch makes better pizza on a consistent basis than this one. On a couple of occasions, the crust here was overdone: it was hard, like a cracker. Plus, the service isn't as great as the other branch. We've had waiters forget things here. The pizza here is still better than elsewhere, but I think the Eastern Ave. branch is better.",

My husband I don't like the same toppings so we tried to order 1/2 on one side and 1/2 on other side.  They charge full price still for each topping even if only on 1/2 the pizza..  Pizza looked large but not filling due to the thin crust.  A small with two toppings will set you back $16.00 bucks.  Was shopping at Fashion Show mall with friends and they wanted to try this place.  4 calzone's and 4 sodas later set us back $91.00 without tip.  Ouch.

The wait for our table was a short 5 minutes. The dining area inside is smaller then I expected so I can't even imagine trying to come here on a Friday or Saturday night and not experience a long wait.   We started off with a small \"Antipasto\". It was $9. I really liked the fresh mozzarella and the whole thing in general. It can easily be shared between 2 people. For pizza we decided to go custom. It had ricotta, mozzarella cheese, sausage and meatballs. They only have thin pizza here since it is NY style. The crust was thin but crisp and held the toppings well. I did enjoy the meatball and sausage but I'm not much of a meat eater so, I did end up picking a lot of the toppings off (people in my party wanted the meat and I wanted cheese ahhhh compromise) and next time I would probably go for a personal pizza with just the cheeses. The pizza is cooked using a coal brick oven. Our total was $37 for the antipasto, pizza and 3 sodas. I didn't think that was bad at all!   They have a dining area outside. They offer a banquet room and catering.",

    "text": "It was a while since I went to Grimaldi's Pizzeria so forgive me if this review is a bit late.  The O.G. Grimaldi's Pizzeria is located in NYC, and is legendary in those parts as being one of the best places to get a slice.  In fact, the one time I was in NYC and had plans to eat there, the line was out the door.  Needless to say we missed the boat on that one.    But luckily, even though it's not location #1 there's a Grimaldi's here in good old Las Vegas.  NY pizza?  Made in coal burning brick oven?  There's nothing like it.  Definitely a step above your chains like the Hut, Dom's, or Papa's.  No offense against Chicago, but I love a slice of NY pie.  No deep dish here at Grimaldi's, just yummy thin crust!  Crisp, a nice burnt edge, clean and tasty.  I could eat an entire pie by myself if given the opportunity.  Grimaldi's has a great menu, somewhat typical of what you would find in a pizza joint.  But simplified.  No chicken fingers or intricate pasta dishes here.  Just pizza, calzones, and salads on the main menu.  And I like it!  Simple is good, as long as you do it right.  The wifey and I shared a date night out and had a great meal.  We started with the Grimaldi's House salad - romaine lettuce, red onion, cherry tomatoes, roasted red peppers, mushrooms, green olives, and mixed with the house vinaigrette.  Good starter - fresh, light, and flavorful with a good kick from the vinaigrette.    For our pizza, we went for a large Grimaldi's seasonal special - The Buffalo Chicken.  It was a pie topped with grilled chicken breast, Buffalo sauce, mozzarella cheese, and bleu chesse crumbles.  Cooked till the crust and top was a golden bubby brown this pizza was pretty scrumptious.  Cheesy and melty, with a spicy punch, and a healthy crunch.  Not bad for a non-traditional pizza.  Next time though I think I might stick with something more Italian, maybe a straight up cheese, or a Margheria with cheese, fresh tomato, and basil.    Pizzas range from $12 - $16 for an entire pie, with toppings coming in at an additional cost each.  Specialty pies will cost in the $20 - $22 range since they come with a range of toppings included.  Calzones come in around the $10 - $18 range depending on what size you get.  Salads are a good deal coming in small or large sizes at prices from $9 - $11.  You can get away with a decent meal for around $40 after tax and tip.  OK for a date night.  Grimaldi's even does pizzas to go, and they come in a fancy box!  So in case you don't want to stay, feel free to call in an order, pick up, and go.  Pizza Pizza!  Wait...wrong chain.",

The kids had pepperoni they also enjoyed thier pizza. Then we ended with Cheesecake for dessert. The kids had a peppermint Cheesecake  (didn't come with candy cane because they were out), we ordered the toffee Cheesecake mmmm so good. Enjoyed our dinner very much.",

    "text": "In the shadow of Boca Park, I enjoyed the Grimaldi's personal pizza as much as I enjoyed eating it in the shadow of the Brooklyn Bridge (not the one in front of New York-New York). Grimaldi's is not brick oven pizza. It is COAL BRICK OVEN PIZZA that is DELICIOUS.      This Grimaldi's looks similar to the majority of their restaurants that I have had the pleasure to dine in. Before we walked in the door, the hostess welcomed us. She seated us in the middle. To the back was the open kitchen where they made the coal brick oven pizza. To the right was a hall with the restrooms.  To the left was a bar. Throughout the restaurant were pictures of New York. Above was soft lighting which made for a relaxing supper.    I ordered a personal pizza ($9). When you dine with other people, the personal pizza is the way to go. It is thin crusted with a portion that will fill you up, and your company will not be thinking badly of you for taking one slice too many. If I had been more hungry I would of paid more for a mushroom topping. The bottomless cola had zero flatness issues. The dinner was supposed to come with house bread. They forgot about it, which is not the end of the world.    With Grimaldi's major growth, it is easy to return to a Grimaldi's. To me this is a good thing.",

    "text": "It's really 4.5 stars, but I'll bump up a half for a couple of outstanding things.  Get to that later.  In the end, Grimaldi's is a legit pizzeria that does everything right.  Great atmosphere for a pizza joint, great service all-around (although it can sometimes be a bit slow), and the best made pizza I've yet found.    So let me explain the \"best made\" part a bit.  I can't quite say Grimaldi's pizzas are the best TASTING pizza I've had, although it is among them.  By \"best made\", I am talking about the parts that made the whole.  - Fresh toppings, including things like real basil leaves, real chopped garlic, etc. - Sauce that's not too much, not too little - (Outstanding #1) Real, white, sliced (not cut into little pieces) mozzarella cheese that eliminates much of the grease that you find at the typical NY pizza place (even in NYC) - (Outstanding #2) Perfectly made crust that is slightly crispy outside, perfectly chewy without being overly firm inside, and not too bready  From ingredients and execution standpoint this really is a 5-star pizza.  The sum of all it's parts, however, may fall a bit shy of that since I can't bring myself to truly give it a full 5-star taste.  No matter, it's still close to it.  Plus, their Caprese salad is the bomb!  Fresh tomatoes and thick mozzarella chunks, bedded by giant, whole leaves of basil.  Nyam, nyam, nyam!  Where do they get those giant basil leaves??  And then top it all off with a glass of Peroni.  In my 4 visits to Grimaldi's I've never been disappointed.  The only thing left to try is their calzone which, by the taste of their pizza crust, should be outstanding.  Table-for-1 Factor:  I typically see most pizza joints as ideal solo dining spots.  Grimaldi's may not exactly fit that bill, but they do have bar area where you can sit and nosh on your own.  I don't see why not.",

I've lived here for nearly five years, and I've tried all of what are purportedly the best pizza joints in town. I realize that pizza is a very personal taste, but for mine - it's Grimaldi's. I've never had a bad pizza there.   I tend to change up what  pizza I order. Recently, I had their special white pizza. I don't remember the exact name of it, though I do recall that it had arugula and prosciutto. OMG - it was DELICIOUS. I think any pizza you order at Grimaldi's would be wonderful, but this is my favorite so far.  If you like Caesar salad, theirs is way above the normal pizza restaurant quality. The small size is more than enough for two!  Service has always been good, the wine list is decent for a pizza place, and the food has never missed. If you haven't tried Grimaldi's, do yourself a favor and check them out. I don't think you'll regret it!! Not the cheapest place in town, but if it's quality you seek, Grimaldi's has it!",

    "text": "I came here with coworkers in a group of 6 people. It was not my choice to go to Grimaldi's because after going to their Fashion Show location, I found their pizza to not be memorable. I never went back until this day when my coworkers wanted to go. I feel the same way, the pizza is ok and I have had better in Vegas.   The pizza is good. It is not bad, but not great. For a chain, I think the taste is just okay but better than Domino's, Pizza Hut, etc. The waitress forget my iced tea I ordered then charged me for it. When I brought it to her attention she said she would take it off the receipt, but no apology for forgetting.   What I don't like is their prices and their add toppings per topping and pay per topping. I got a personal white pizza (enough for 1 meal if you are really hungry or 2 meals if you are not that hungry). It has 6 small/medium sized slices. The base price is $10 for a personal sized white pizza. Add artichoke hearts $4, add mushrooms $2, add spinach $2, add mushrooms $2. My pizza is now $20 for a personal size pizza! Hmm did my pizza have truffles on it for that price? I did not even get my sun dried tomatoes or extra garlic because it would cost more $$! I think this is a rip off. You are better off getting large pizzas and splitting them if your party can agree to the pizza type. They really should come up with some pizzas that have the toppings already on there. If you think you are being customized by allowing toppings to be placed on for additional charges, it does not work when it becomes highly overpriced. Well this is a big company and I highly doubt they will ever change their method of pricing per topping, so in that case I highly doubt I would be back (not by my choice).   We did get a free cheesecake for teacher appreciation week and I got strawberry. I was not impressed with the consistency of the cheesecake, it was soft (way too soft and yes there is such a thing). I like a firmer more dense cheesecake personally. The strawberries were kind of odd baked into the cheesecake, so they got weird mushy.   I spent $32 for my personal size pizza, half a small salad I shared, water, and tip and tax. That seems like a lot for what I got.",

When I bit into the thin crispy crust, it was obvious unlike any pizza I had tasted before. The Coal Oven crust was crispy and charred, the toppings were plenty and fresh. And I loved the sauce on top so no chance of sogginess!! Our pie was topped with double sausage, artichoke hearts, ricotta cheese and mushroom. Writing this makes my mouth water.

Decor is pretty similar in each location with the red and white checkered table linen.    I would say that the pizza is great and consistent.  Salads are always fresh.  I left feeling satisfied but not stuffed.  One large pizza will get you about 8 slices.   You cannot go wrong with a Caesar Salad and an 18\" traditional pepperoni pizza for a family of 4 (2 slices each).  Depending on how hungry everyone is, you can add a personal pizza in case that is not enough and the fam wants another small helping.  Pepperoni tasted fresh, dough was perfectly baked (not doughy, nice and flaky but not too crispy or burnt).  Cheese nice and bubbly initially, settles down and tastes fresh.  The pizza is baked in a coal brick oven which gives it a great flavor and smell.    Always on point.  I will be coming back!!",

I would come from the strip to the Summerlin location because it was just the best experience always.   The atmosphere is lovely. They've managed to have a nice casual ambiance that's suitable for dinner with a friend or a casual date night with a little elegance thrown in. I personally prefer to sit outside on the patio next to the water fountain. Particularly in the evenings this is really nice.    The food is amazing. I absolutely love their anti-pasta salad. The pizza is phenom, of course. They are great at customizing your pizza for you-I highly suggest adding pesto into the sauce, if you like that flavor. I also love fresh basil thrown on top, uncooked. Absolutely fabulous.  But wait there's more! Save room for dessert because it is out of this world. They have amazing cheesecakes and it's worth getting the sampler.  I brought my four-year-old here for the first time this week, and I love that they brought him a slice of pizza dough to play with as Play Dough. Wow he loved that and I didn't have to break out his tablet! Very cool touch.  The service here is great. I've always had the most friendly and capable servers and bartenders here. This last time, I had brought a friend who is visiting Vegas. Our pizza came out but the server said this is a temporary pizza and laughed. He said we didn't get it right so we are already making another one but we didn't want you to be hungry. I said \"no no that's not necessary this will be totally fine but I appreciate it.\" The guy was a total character waved his hands in the air, and said \"it's already done- The pizza's in the oven and there's no stopping it now!\"  We had a good laugh. A while later they brought us a second pizza and offered a box of the first one.  Needless to say we left with a lot of pizza that night, and smiles on our faces.  To make things even better, the manager himself came over and apologized for the mistake and asked if there was anything else he could do for us. He explained how important it was for his patrons to be happy and get what they asked for, exactly.  Class act, and so sincere.  Greatly appreciated this far more than a second pizza.  I highly recommend coming here and giving it a try. You won't be sorry!",

    "text": "When you want some good pizza, gotta pay the price. Definitely on the pricey end, but it's on a nice thinner crust. We put together our own pizza, so of course we loved it. If you add basil to your pizzas, you can either have it cooked or freshly topped! The ingredients tasted fresh and it wasn't too saucy.   It was my first time here, so I'm not sure if it's always this busy, but the place was packed and the host/ess are pretty accurate with wait times.  The food was amazing and it's saving grace, but not enough to give it 5 stars.   The service: not that great. Yes, I understand it was busy, but we found an ant in my water and that took some time to get replaced. I'm surprised nothing was offered to apologize for the incident, but I'm just glad I caught it before drinking it.  Of course when our beers came out, you better believe I checked that, too.   The food is pricey. With a shared pizza and beers, we were already past $40.",

The strangest thing about their pizza is that as soon as it cools down, the crust becomes virtually inedible.  It's hard and tough.  I don't know if it's bc it's overbaked or overworked but you've gotta eat it while it's piping hot for half a chance at a decent pizza.  They do have a decent antipasto platter though and the Caesar salad is alright.",

I ordered the house salad- which was loaded with mushrooms, onions, tomatoes,red peppers, green olives, and topped off with black pepper. The small portion was a great size enough for two; and they weren't skimpy whatsoever with the veggies unlike some places who give you 3 pieces of vegetable and a huge portion of lettuce. Pizza crust was amazing I loved how it was a little black on the bottom from the oven, gave it flavor! Sauce and toppings were top notch- very delicious! For dessert we had tiramisu and classic cheesecake. Tiramisu was great but that cheesecake was PHENOMENAL!  *** best cheesecake I've ever tasted***   The manager David came by several times to check on us as well and let me tell you how nice of a guy and GREAT manager David is. No wonder this location is awesome! He even gave us a free salad for our next order which I thought was super nice! Wish I remembered the name of our waitress but she was extremely friendly and sweet as well!   Service was just as good as the food which lands Grimaldi's a 10/10 in my book.",

Im not from new york or chicago who claim they have the best pizza but compared to amore of chicago and the newyork pizzas they have around here grimaldis is far better. I believe they have new york roots either way great pizza spot good for family and friends. Desert is very sweet and normally just stay away from it.",

The Grimaldi's here on Rampart was very nice inside but when it comes to the food, I'll be honest and say it's above par but not nearly the as good as their location in New York. I'll more than likely be back because of the nostalgic feeling I get while eating their pizza... :)",

I, lol, drink a lot of Ice Tea when we go out to eat, so that being said, all I ask is that my Ice be filled up when it gets low...  I think I consider myself to be a good tipper, and my expectations are pretty simple, keep my tea filled and check on us once in awhile...sounds easy enough?

I found it to be a little weird that they do not offer any specialty pizzas - you have to create your own with toppings sauces etc, but its kind of cool-  my fiance and I have made a different pizza every time we have been there.  They also have pesto sauce as an option for a sauce which is amazing.  I am not a super red sauce fan so it is nice to have another option when it comes to pizza sauce!  The pizza's are a little pricey but keep in mind a large pizza is only 2 dollars more then a medium pizza- so go for it and take the left overs home!",

The pizza is excellent . . . some of my favorite pizza EVER. The pesto pizza is a personal favorite and the cannolis are to die for when it comes time for desert. The reasons why I didn't give Grimaldi's 5 stars? They don't offer delivery, they charge you for a brand new soft drink/lemonade with every \"refill\" (BEWARE) and all of the toppings are a la cart, so \"building\" your ultimate pizza can easily double the base price, particularly when the topping costs are the same for every pizza size and also the same price even if you only want a topping on half the pizza.",

Love all the options you have from the sauce to the toppings.  The atmosphere was very alive but not crazy loud.  The staff was extremely friendly and helpful in explaining the menu, options and making suggestions.  Just wish they did delivery!  Definitely a place that I will go to on a regular basis.  Great beer and beverage selection also.  This is how pizza should be!",

I would have hoped for fresh oregano and basil on top along with the fresh mozzarella.  For $12, I was hoping for a better selection of olives.  The pizza was a price right but the crust was a little lacking.  Almost too thin and crunchy.  It was like pizza on a cracker.  I like the crust to resemble really crusty bread with a little chew.  The sauce was the winner with great fresh tomato flavor and the toppings were top notch.  The beer prices were also not bad.",

It was, only if you aren't really hungry which we were but we appreciated her assisting us trying to be more economical.  For our pizza we ordered artichokes, sundried tomato, and onions.  We loved how thin the pizza was but there wasn't much crunch.  Maybe that was due to the amount of water in the vegetables which transferred to the crust.  Not really sure, but I do remember having crunchy vegetarian pizza.  Overall, the location and atmosphere was very pleasant and we will definitely go back.",

How right they were, the pizza was pale and somewhat under done even though we asked for well done and crispy; with NONE of the charred irregular bubbles around the edge that is the hallmark of coal oven pie. Just a very average over-priced pizza. If you cannot get to the Eastern store, SKIP GRIMALDI'S!!!",

They spread the cheese different than other pizza places in that it's put on in drops, so there's drops of cheese and drops of sauce. It's no wonder they have 13 locations in Vegas, Arizona and Texas. They do pizza right. The sauce is delicious. Real pizza sauce, not spicy and no tomato chunks. They have an outside eating area that's very comfortable, but the pizza gets cold out there. Stay away from the high priced drinks and a large pizza with drink will be under $20, not counting tip.",

The main thing i loved about this place is how super kid friendly this place is.  My friend brought her 1 year old daughter to this place.  By the time we got to our table, they already had a high chair set up.  When they took our orders, they also where considerate about the little ones well being with giving her her own sealable cup AND to keep her busy they gave her her own dough in a pan to play with.  Seriously!  You can't get this anywhere. When our pizza arrived, the server served us pure slices into our plates, with all the condiments we wanted.  The desert selection was very good and tasty.  You can tell the cooks put alot of heart into their food. Overall great food, great environment, definitely stop by.",

    "text": "Now like most college students, pizza is something I eat on the regular. Maybe a slice from Metro Pizza, or a cheap $5.00 from Little Ceasars, but it's not often I go to a place wanting more than just your average slice. Grimaldi's Pizzeria is that place to get that more than average slice!  We decided to visit Grimaldi's after a brief business meeting that didn't run quite as brief as we had planned. We considered going to Monta (refer to my past review that great experience) but based on the size of the group we decided somewhere a little more open would be more suitable. A member of the group had mentioned that Grimaldi's was a great place for some pizza, and so we took a vote and Grimaldi's came out on top.  Once we arrived I was pleasantly surprised by the decor. This place really gave off a classy vibe while still being comfortable and fun. The chandeliers weren't diamond and gold, they were empty wine bottles, talk about inventive! There were older pictures framed on the wall that really made you feel like this place had something authentic going on, which I suppose it did. They only design flaw that came to mind for the group was that there was only one restroom for both genders. Not really too much of an issue when it's not that busy, but I'd imagine an unhappy line of people during the high business hours.  Now whats the first thing you look at after you sit down in a restaurant? Many people might say the table, and in that case you're probably right. But one of the first things you take a good look at is the menu. The menu I had in my night was at first a little confusing. At Grimaldi's they don't have a list of pre-built pizza, every pizza is built to order. There were three types of base pizza. The traditional pizza, a white with garlic pizza, and the pesto. Following that was a list of toppings including items like fresh cut tomatoes, meatballs, and even anchovies. Knowing their menu can be a bit daunting, the waitress was very quick to inform everyone at the table of how the ordering process went. Not only was this very helpful, it was quite entertaining as well. The staff was excellent and very knowledgeable about their menu. The waitress also helped us decide on how we would split the check before we ordered, which is great because at most places we're left at the end with 5 people who need to pay on card and no pre-arranged plan what-so-ever.  Being new to the place our side of the table decided to try something we don't usually see on a menu. We opted for a Large (18 in.) white and garlic pizza with Meatballs, Italian sausage, sun dried tomatoes, and artichoke hearts. The wait for the food was a little long, but understandable considering the table had so far ordered 3 large completely custom pizzas. The pizza that arrived was amazing. The toppings tasted quite fresh and the flavor was fantastic. The crust was enjoyable and the cheese was stringy and delicious, just how I like it. The standard condiments were at the table, parmesan and the crushed red pepper, but they were also joined by a few others like garlic powder. Each pizza was cut into 8 pieces and since we had 6 people on our check we decided it was a good idea to order a second.  The second pizza we ordered was a large Pesto with grilled chicken, roasted sweet red peppers, and freshly sliced tomatoes. If you haven't eaten a pesto pizza before, maybe Grimaldi's should be where you are having dinner tonight, this pizza was amazing. It was full of flavor, the fresh pieces chicken complimented the flavorful pesto while the sweet red pepper really brought balance to the whole ensemble. The waitress had told us that people order combinations similar to this and we can see why, it did not disappoint in the least.  Grimaldi's Pizzeria is a bit on the pricey side, the average large pizza you will build comes out to around $30.00 each, but when you break it down to each person it's not that bad. Grimaldi's over all was a great experience and definitely a good place to go if you're looking for more than the average slice of pizza and want to be daring with your choices.",

The kind that has that discinctive look and taste to it.  The downside is the pizza is expensive and not that filling.  My wife and I split an antipasto, which was excellent and a large pizza with 3 toppings and it was $35.  For the two of us, we ate every last piece and were not exactly full.  The pizza is very thin, so honestly, a 16\" large is not that much for two.  If you have an appetite, you will need more than 1 pie.",

Three month's ago we moved to Las Vegas and I am so happy that we finally found a pizzeria that we can look forward to. Our pizza was fabulous and the service was amazing. Only negative was that there wasn't enough leftover pizza tonight. I only had two slices and was bummed out because I wanted more! Never have liked warmed up pizza so much.

    "text": "I had pretty high expectations coming to this location, and they were mostly upheld, but I wanted better. The pizza was pretty solid, but the service was lacking a little bit. I showed up earlier than the rest of my party on Thursday for lunch so I sat at the bar and drank an ice cold glass of water after a morning round of golf. I heard a manager talking, saying he was \"giving this table of first-timers a comped order of canolis\"  When we were seated we went outside, and it was beautiful out so that was great. The hostess offered \"iced tea, water, or maybe a Peroni\" She didn't ask us if it was our first time, offer to describe the menu and their prices or try to upsell anything like an appetizer or garlic bread or salads. We decided to split a large and the ladies in the group were gonna split a small pizza, and the small is still plenty to share. The girls also decided to split a small caesar salad. We ordered and everything went normal. The pizza took a little longer than I anticipated being a very thin crust and the very beginning of lunch hour, but came out nicely proportioned with plenty of meatballs and onions on one, and plenty of ricotta cheese and pepperonis on the other. The pepperoni was nice and spicy, and the meatballs are full of flavor and nice and large too. When it came time to ask if everything was going well, clear the plates, get us our checks and get the hell out of there is where the service lacked. Our server disappeared for a good 10-12 minutes when we were done eating and it took a long time to get the check and clear the credit card back to us to sign.  One of the other things that bugs me about Grimaldis is that each topping is at least $2-4 and the personal cheese pizza starts at $10 and the large at $18. If you get a large with 2 toppings you're already looking at $24+ just for a pizza. Add two drinks and a salad and you're looking at $45 with a tip for a lunch.  Also, what kinda place doesn't serve ranch? We asked for a side of ranch to dip the crust in when the pizza came and she said they don't even serve it at this restaurant. With salad on the menu how do you not serve ranch? This is America right? We love our ranch dressing. Disappointing 3 stars, I'll probably try it again, but probably not too soon since it's about 25 mins away from my house",

They boast having the best coal-fired brick oven, New York-style thin crust pizza in the world and it's hard for me to argue against them.  It certainly beats any other chain or franchise pizza place I've been too.  They have tons of toppings to choose from, but I recommend their white pizza with pepperoni and extra garlic.  You'll smell terrible after, but it is oh so delicious!  A personal size could probably feed 2 people.  Now if only they opened a location in Southern California...",

We always order a pizza with pepperoni, bacon,  garlic and basil and it is always amazing. We are pizza lovers and this is pizza we love.  The music is uplifting and the staff is always friendly.   Last time I decided to try a Cesar salad not expecting to be wowed by it because most salads are romaine cores with wilted lettuce. This was none of that.  The romaine was a lovely green, fresh and crunchy. The dressing was lovely and not over done. The croutons are oven roasted and delicious. The entire small salad is enough to feed two with pizza or one really hungry person. I love this place. Service is generally prompt but worth the wait we have endured.",

Parking is awful there when they are busy, but they do offer valet parking if you would rather not walk a half mile or drive around looking for a spot all day.  They have outside seating as well as seating inside. There is also a bar inside the restaurant. The staff is very friendly and we did not have to wait too long for our food.  As far as the pizza goes, it's not bad. It is definitely over priced. It is good thin crust pizza. I can't tell the difference between coal oven pizza and wood fire pizza, but they use a coal oven. It is definitely not NY pizza. I would compare it to pizza like you would get at Sammy's.  The salads were were plain and bland, just like most pizza places serve their salads.  Again. It is expensive for a pizza in this place. Each item is $2 or $3 extra, depending on the item. One pizza with a few items really adds up.  I would recommend trying it though if you have never been there. It was pretty good.",

We we got to our table and they gave our three boys some pizza to play with while we waited for our food.  They all had a blast trying to make the dough into the perfect round pizza shape.  There was a grumpy old codger at the table next to us, he complained to the server right from the start... \"We've never been here before, and with these prices I'm sure we won't be back...\" I could see that all the tables around them were watching his every complaint and everyone was impressed with how the sever attempted to handle him.  After he left all four surrounding tables talked to her about her wonderful customer. She handled her self very well and was very sweat and professional in the face of someone who was never going to be satisfied.   We couldn't decide on traditional, or the pesto, pizza base so we went for one of each.  We added different topping to each side and made some pretty amazing, yet pricey, combinations.  It ended up being pricy, but totally worth it.   The bottom line... great atmosphere, great food and very friendly service!  Based on our experience at this location, we will definitely make time to check out the original location on our next trip to New York!!!",

    "text": "Well.  I tried this location and Grimaldi's for the first time tonight based on referrals from a friend and other positive comments online.  It sounded like it would be amazing!  I received a birthday coupon for a free 18 inch with one topping so thought this would be a great time to try it out.   First I will say that the service was phenomenal (hence the second star)!  Our server was prompt and courteous, although I did feel a little rushed by her.  The staff appeared genuine and were very helpful being it was our first time there. The food.  Hmm.  We ordered a house salad to share, as we were told it was a good portion for two.  It was actually a portion for at least three.  There were only two olives in the salad, the lettuce was cut in very small pieces.  We added on chicken and mozzarella.  The portions added into the salad were so small that we wondered why we had to pay extra for them!   The pizza.  Wow!  The crust was much thinner than I had expected.  I actually liked the texture of the dough but it had a funny taste to it.  I could not pin point it.  On the way home I realized it almost tasted like a poison.  Something I had never experienced.  I also realized there was no oregano on the pizza.  Something I am used to with two of their competitors in town: Anthony and Mario's Broadway Pizza on Charleston and Metro Pizza.   Cheeeeeese!  Why was there no cheese on our pizza?  Okay there was SOME....but ....not in every bite!  Where there was no cheese there was the topping.   I really am disappointed.  I was expecting a much better experience.  I was excited about trying it and feel really let down.  This is one place that had a once in a lifetime chance with me.  How do you screw up pizza?  Well, they succeeded.  I will remain loyal to Anthony and Mario's Broadway Pizzeria and to Metro Pizza in this town.  If I'm going to eat all these calories, I want it to be worth it!  Thanks for the free pizza Grimaldi that cost us $31 with the salad, extras and two iced teas that were actually glasses of ice with a little tea for topping.  Just not worth it.",

We popped in for lunch and were seated right away.  Our server came by and gave us the scoop on the different types of pizza and the ordering process.  We decided on what we wanted, which was our go to of pepperoni and mushrooms on the regular pizza.  We then sat and waited for our pizza to come out while smelling all of the pizzas around us.  We were salivating like rabid dogs just from the wonderful aromas drifting this way and that!  Nothing really smells better than fresh baked pizza in my book! Yummmm.  So when our beautiful pepperoni and mushroom pizza arrived, we attacked the pie like no one's business.  The first bite I took resulting in me seeing fireworks going off.  I totally had a party in my mouth.  All I can say about the flavor is AMAZING!  I was in love from the first bite.  By the time I had finished my lovely first slice, my hubby was on his 3rd piece.  I don't think he was taking time between bites to breathe or even chew.  He was in pizza ecstasy!  We are now Grimaldi's lovers!  It has been added to our list of regular pieces to visit.  They have an email club and if you plan on going, I would sign up for it.  They send decent coupons pretty regularly and even a free pizza for your birthday!  I had actually signed up for the email club before we went.  I love a good coupon!   If you haven't checked this place out, I highly recommend it.  I think you will be please!",

I really enjoy it here.  one thing we didn't know about was that from 4-445 each day (so they say) is that they clean the ovens to prepare for the dinner crowd.  however, they stay open... so what happened for us was that we got in at 345 and sat down and they told us that the ovens will be cleaned during the next hour so no pizza, just apps, salads, and the bar pretty much.  It WAS an inconvenience, since it's not really located in a mall that you can walk around in, but since you're already there, we figured we might as well wait.  we ended up ordering dessert first to get a head start.  it took awhile, but eventually the pizzas came out and they are always so good.  thin and crispy - they way we like it.  we will be back, just not around those times.",

We also had a small cesars salad which we shared as well ....very tasty. We indulged in the daily made cheese cake which is to die for!! The best cheese cake I ever had ....better than the cheese cake factory . Highly recommend !",

Salads are fresh and well presented and the portions are more than generous.  What really made my visit and experience stand out was the bartender who helped me.  Natalie was amazing.  I haven't worked in a restaurant in over a decade but I still have an eye for talent.  Beautiful, efficient, knowledgeable and a sparkling personality she made my dining experience memorable.  She was swamped the entire time I was there yet everyone's drink stayed filled the waiters never had to wait and her smile and personality never missed a beat.  This ability to do her role and still give a wonderful, personal experience to everyone present is rare and under appreciated.  I'll be back without a doubt but I may have to steal this talented lady away from Grimaldi's!",

I have been to the Grimaldi's in Houston and it was the best pizza I have ever had.   The pizza was the same here and did not disappoint. I would keep it basic.  Try and stick to two toppings per pizza.  The salads are good. We  ended up with a caprese and house salad. A plain cheese, a pepperoni and mushroom, and a meatball and ricotta pizza.  All were outstanding.",

The service was great, the atmosphere was fine, however the pizza was less than average.  Very expensive for a crust that was \"cracker like\".  We all ordered different pizzas, the Don, plain cheese/mushroom, a meat lovers and a veggie.  The sauce was less than average and two of us commented that we could get a Trader Joe's frozen pizza that would taste better.  We all said the same thing...we can scratch this place off the list for the future.  We are originally from New York, New Jersey, Las Vegas and Chicago.  We all agreed it isn't worth a second trip.  My dead grandmother could still make better pizza than these guys.",

They cook the pizza in a stone oven I think, and its super hot, which mens the pizza is cooked through, but because of the short cooking times, they don't burn it.  All the pizza is thin crust, but they have both traditional and white with garlic.  They have a generous wine selection, which is good if you like wine with your pizza.  After eating here, I can't go anywhere else.  Even Settebello falls short of this experience.",

My friends suggested Grimaldi's, saying it might even beat my former pizza love, so I was game.   I wouldn't go as far as saying it beat Ciao Ciao's, but it was definitely good and we will be back.   We took our 15 mo. old with us for an early Sunday dinner. It was great to see so many other kids there and they even offer \"kid dough\"-- pizza dough for the them to play with at the table. We got a large pizza, half cheese and half pepperoni... the pizza was great. Awesome crust, delicious sauce and cheese... the only thing I will not be getting again was the pepperoni. It was the small slices like you'd find on a Red Barron frozen pizza and the flavor wasn't great. We picked it off and still managed to finish the whole pizza.   We will definitely be returning. Great family place. Quick service. Yummy food. You can't beat it! (Although, I will say... I still miss Ciao Ciao's.)",

    "text": "Grimaldi's pizza is good (3.5 stars).  Problem is, it should be amazing (especially for the whopping price tag).  The menu boasts a wonderful list of fresh ingredients for pizza toppings, all topped with fresh mozzarella.    The simple rundown: - crispy, delicious crust (5 star crust) - salty, tasty fresh mozzarella - soft tasting, smooth tomato sauce (not remarkable, but tasty enough) - wonderful list of ingredients (including roasted garlic) - everything blends together well and the pizza's not overly greasy  Just writing out that list, I want to head back there and order another pizza, but then I remember that I just wasn't wowed.  Somehow all of that goodness fails to rise up to greatness and you're left eating a pizza that you enjoy, but . . . well, just enjoy.  All of which earns Grimaldi's 4 stars (I mean, I am a fan).  But put the price tag on the pizza and it loses half a star.  Bottom line: they're just not living up to what they're charging.",

    "text": "I love this new location and i am so glad Grimaldi's decided to open one on my side of town.  The first time I a taste of heavenly pizza was down at the Eastern location and when this one opened in Summerlin I was ecstatic!  As you can see I am a regular at Grimaldi's and these are just a few must haves when you are there!  1. The pesto pizza is to die for, alongside the white.  I usually get a half and half just so i can get the best of both worlds. 2. My Favorite toppings are: Sausage, ricotta cheese, pepperonis, onions, extra garlic, roasted peppers, and maybe some basil.  (these are just a few of my favs that i think are their specialties that is a must, however, all other toppings are very good as well) 3. Their Greek or Mediterranean salads are amazing!  light and refreshing, not over the top heavy creamy dressing which is very nice right before a hearty meal. 4. they have half off bottle wines some nights or some times so it's always smart to ask the waitresses what their specials are in case you are looking for a good time!  Friendly tip:  if you can't decide on the size of pizza, always go with large because you can never go wrong with leftover grimaldi's for a midnight snack or next day breakfast. if more than 2 people, get two large with different toppings and get creative!  i don't think you can go wrong either way!  don't get scared away by the wait, there's a total wines and shops in this plaza so even if the wait is 30 mins, you can easily kill time in the plaza without going too far.",

The kids are whining , it's 7-30 and they need to eat . We try Grimaldi's , they say \" 15 minutes \" . Done deal.  After 30 minutes we are seated , our server is truly excellent , offered water , ice teas immediately . They arrive about 2 minutes later . Great.  The menu , Pizza or Salad . That's it , no sides , appetizers , nothing. It's a Pizza restaurant so I suck it up. They do give you a small plate of thinly sliced bread with oil & vinegar so the kids are slightly placated.  We order one large cheese pie , and one large pie with grilled chicken and mushrooms.  These pizzas are FABULOUS! Our server dispensed the first slices , offered some condiments before leaving . Delicious , thin crispy pizza served very hot. Could not have asked for more.   Wine and beer menus are extensive , place is typical ' we're from NY Italian heritage ' decorated but very well done.  Server boxed the uneaten pizza for us and we left.   Will we go back. For sure.",

They started off with the Caesar Salad (small) which looked pretty large to me.  I'm not a big fan of ordering salads since they don't do anything for me....just some greens tossed with sauce. They decided on ordering the Pesto Pizza with Onions, Sun Dried Tomatoes and Mushrooms. I'm not a big fan of onions, so I was picking them out. The pizza itself was a bit dry, but I think it was the Pesto. I didn't think there was anything spectacular or magical about the pizza, but I willing to go back and try the WHITE pizza which I think is more my style. Service was a bit slow, but overall its an ok pizza joint.",

Went for lunch with my wife Today and ordered a small house salad that could easily have been an appetizer for 3 people.  We also ordered a white pizza with prosciutto and arugal with shaved parmigiano.  We ordered it a little on the well done side and we're rewarded with a nice flavorful crispy pie.  Now here's the kicker.  When the manager (yes the manager not the waiter) delivered the pizza  he informed us that one of the slice had developed a hole in it during baking.  This was not a big deal for me sometimes the dough bubbles when you bake it and things happen.  What we didn't expect was for him to be apologizing profusely for the hole and informing us that he had ordered another of the same pizza personal size (which is 12 inches) to make up for the hole  This was so unexpected and they were so nice to do this that obviously a nice tip was left and the customer service over what for me was really a non issue definitely earned them  5 stars today.",

I absolutely was thrilled to see this place at Boca Park since my wife and I just moved from the Big Apple in July of 2011. This review is based on a visit in Sept of that year.   The only thing this place had in common with the original Grimaldi's is the name. Sad. I don't remember much, but there was nothing special about it. I have I guess two categories for pizza. There's NY pizza and everything else. So I can eat a pizza and say this is one of the best I've had, or one of the best I've had outside of NY. My standard in pizza comes from places like Grimaldi's, Patsy's in Harlem, L&B Spumoni Gardens, DiFaras, etc... This place was nothing more than a chain pizzeria licensing the name.  The pie was bland, toppings terrible, no taste really. I will never go back. The waiter was really nice though.",

I've been a fan of their pizza ever since it was introduced to me at work when we were filming TV shows near the eastside location.  I had been meaning to come by and show my support for the \"new\" Grimaldi's by my house for awhile.  We dined on the patio, and it was perfect weather to do so.  Yes, it's that one week in Vegas between hot summers and cold winters.  The service left something to be desired, and I was bummed that there weren't any appetizers on the menu like garlic knots (I swear there used to be, no?) -- but those are my only real complaints.  The pizza was great, and the ingredients were fresh as always.  I'm sure there was a price for the pizza, but I got lucky in that I won some Internet contest and received a $100 Grimaldi's gift card in the mail a month or so ago, so the only money that left my pocket was for a tip.",

I didn't think it would be the same so I was a bit reluctant to try. They gave our daughter dough to play with which gained my attention instantly. The servers were super nice and helpful as I am not easy to please and come with a crapload of personality (& questions). The pizza was so good! And even when I started to feel full I couldn't stop eating. They warned us not to get to full because of dessert and we totally did! So we waited a while and ordered the seasonal reesees cheesecake and like I said... My oh my!",

    "text": "Ok, I was heading home after checking out another Pizzeria and decided today was Pizza day and stopped by here to give it a try.  I didn't expect to find a nice restaurant, but that's exactly what the place is like.  It's tucked between the Summerlin renowned Kona Grill & Gordon Biersch in the Boca Park Shopping Center.  This spot has failed numerous times over the past 5 years.....I hope these people make it.  Anyway, I sat at the bar and ordered a Blue Moon.  They don't serve Pizza by the slice here....so I had to go for a 12\" Personal Pizza.  Since I already had 3 slices from the other joint, I knew I had my work cut out for me despite the small size.  I decided on a Pepperoni & Jalapeno Pizza.....the bartender Aubrey or was it Audrie?....anyway, she said the Jalapenos kick your ass, so was I sure I wanted it......of course I do!  The restaurant has a cool & comfortable feel to it.  I'll have to bring the family back sometime soon.  After a few minutes my Pizza came out.  It was much larger than I expected.  The thin crust was cooked nice and cripsy....well done, just how I like it.  However, there is a lot of sauce on this Pizza.....more than I normally like, -2 in my book.    The flavor of the sauce overwhelms the Pizza, so it's hard to taste the other ingredients.  The Pepperoni is the tiny almost Slim Jim type and had good flavor to it....too bad it was drowned in sauce.  Aubrey/Audrie was right, the Jalapenos do pack a serious Punch.....I was sweating pretty good after a couple of slices, and no it wasn't from the 100 degree DRY Vegas heat....it was from the Jalapenos.....good thing Aubrey/Audrie kept my Blue Moon full.  Overall, I enjoyed the atmosphere, service, and the Pizza.  Will I return?  Yes, I will bring the family with me next time and try a different pie.",

    "text": "Grimaldi's is GREAT pizza! This is by far my favorite pizza hands down!! I love to fold it in half and go for it! However my family does prefer thin crust pizza. If you are a Chicago style pizza lover, this may not be the pizza for you.  We always get our pizza with pepperoni, garlic and onions and then ask for it  well done. We usually order one to eat there and one to take home, because it's just as good, if not better leftover the next day!  The outside patio seating is great for the kids and so is the pizza dough that they bring out for them to play with.  We have done many family birthdays here with quite a few people, and every time, even though they don't always have a lot of floor space for all of the people that we bring in, they are always accommodating. (The Eastern and Serene location has a separate room for larger parties, which is easier. )   Despite another review below,  your pizza does include cheese in the base price. They only charge for cheese if you are ordering extra cheese. Also, ricotta cheese is not the standard cheese that your pizza comes with, that is an extra topping that you can order. They use fresh mozzarella on their pizzas. So I think it's kind of funny that this reviewer felt their intelligence was being insulted about having to pay for cheese, when in fact they had it all wrong to begin with!",

PS. my friend who got the leftovers said it was much better hot and toasted at home. :)",

    "text": "To eat here you must love coal brick-oven pizza, sliced mozarella, fresh sauce and thin crust. If you do, you'll like the pizza at Grimaldi's.  Although I lack experience with True NY style pizza, I must say that if this represents a small percentage of it, I'm down for some NY love.    Grimaldi's is all about the oven, the crust, and the fresh ingredients.  When I saw the 3.5 star rating two weeks ago I realized that I had to eat the pizza to find out for myself.  Mind you, all of us have different tastes when it comes to pizza, each person wanting a certain stretch to the dough or sweetness to the sauce.  I personally love sweeter sauce, but at Grimaldi's it's more tangy.  I personally love shredded cheese but here it's sliced fresh mozzarella.  I needed to try something different, so I went for the personal with basil.  It took ten minutes to complete my pizza, not long at all.  When I received the box I sort of freaked out at the size.  I'm used to the pizza hut sizes, where personal means that small round personal pan pizza.  Their version of personal reminds me of a medium, or something very close to that.  The crust is super thin, slightly crispy especially on the edges, and the ingredients are layered nicely on top.  It was interesting to see the sauce exposed between the slices of cheese, and crispy basil on top.  I hopped into my car, turned on the a/c, and peeled a slice from the box.  Wow.  This pizza is yummy.  I'm not going to go so far as to say something fabulous, amazing, or even orgasmic, but I love this pizza.  At the point it's slightly soggy from the sauce, but still holds up while you eat it.  It's one of those pizzas I recommend folding the sides in a bit while holding it to eat it properly.  My husband hates crust and he ate the whole pizza--crust and all.  I love the tangy fresh tomato sauce, the mozzarella that stretches beautifully when bitten in to, and I go for basil in the oven rather than after because it gets sweeter and has that crispy texture to it.  Yum.  After the first time there I went back two days later for the same order.  Then two days after that.  Oh and then three days from that day, and then four days ago and the day before yesterday.  Yeah.  I like it that much. I always order the same thing--personal with basil--because I don't want to ruin the flavors of the other ingredients and the crust.  I love the taste of the dough on this pizza--slightly sweet, almost a hint of sourdough-ness, and you can taste the char a bit.    Remember, we all have different tastes, and many aren't in to this type of pizza.  For me, it's the only pizza I'll eat till I find another great NY pizza joint in town.  The other downfall of this place are the prices.  Many wouldn't pay $9 for a personal size and then pay $2-$5 dollars per additional topping.  The small is $13, for example, so many get turned off by the price.  Still, it's a great pizza joint that I've yet to eat in at because I love the idea of getting a pizza in a box.  It's just this weird thing I have with pizza.  You should try Grimaldi's if you haven't yet.  It's not your typical pizza delivery crap, but something ten times better.  I like it, and I hope that your taste in pizza matches this place, too.",

It was just OK. The crust was thin and crispy, just how I like it, and my plate wasn't covered in orange grease when I was done., which is another positive.   But the pizza, which started out as great, became increasingly boring piece after piece. I don't know how this is possible, but both the sauce and the crust lost some, or rather most of their punch after it cooled down a bit.   We ordered a  1/2 carafe of their house red and it was lovely, and the service we experienced was exceptional. No complaints there.   When shopping in Boca Park, it would be a great stop for lunch, and hubby and I agreed we'd return to Grimaldi's rather than go to our usual lunch spot, Cheesecake Factory, but we probably won't be planning any dinners here again.   Oh and the outside dining is fabulous! Very nice little area with great people watching. So since Vegas has such a small window of 75 degree weather, you gotta jump on it and find a place with a decent patio.",

It was pretty hot inside the restaurant, I'm not sure if the AC was not working well.  It was loud too, a bit hard to have a conversation.  Our server came back a few times to see how we liked the food and if we needed anything else.  We have ordered take out here before, that one was good as well but I think it is better when you enjoy it at the restaurant while it's still hot.",

I took my Mom here for a late lunch. We were greeted by Elliot when we walked in and asked us if we prefer the booth or high stool chairs. Booth pleeease! And I'm glad we did. I never knew how nice it is in the back of the restaurant. I always came in for dinner and sat in the front area or patio seating. Summer time is great with those booths in the back. Melissa introduced herself and asked if we would like to order any drinks. For two of us, she recommended the large Pellegrino, which was way too much for us. At the end of our meal, I burped and it stung my nose so bad, I had a tear fall down my cheek. Order the small bottle instead. Your nose will thank me later!   We ordered a small Grimaldi's House Salad, which looked more like a large portion! It felt like I drank a tall glass of fresh kool-aid. So refreshing! We ordered their large pizza with green peppers, artichoke hearts, and Italian sausage. My mom creation.. don't ask. Elliot came by with our pizza and asked us.. who would like the first slice. Then asked if we would like any Oregano, Parmesan Cheese, Garlic Powder, or Chili Peppers. We added all those to our slice of pizza and the first bite had so much flavor. I did notice that once the piping hot pizza cooled off.. the pizza, itself became stale. The chewy crust was hard as old french bread. Eat it while it's hot and you're good. Once it cools off, good luck!   Now to the dessert. I love their Tiramisu here. I absolutely have to order this every time I dine here. It's made in-house and so is their Cheesecake. The mascarpone custard is creamy, light, and soft. The coffee and rum were so balanced that nothing overpowered one another. If you're in the mood for sweets, this is definitely a place for great Tiramisu!!!   At the end, Melissa, Elliott, and even the happy go manager lady thanked us for dining here and wished us to have a great day. A nice start to the first day of the week. Happy Monday ;)",

    "text": "Grimaldi's is very generous with their birthday gift if you are in their email club; they give you a large one topping pizza for free! No other purchase necessary! They allow to you add toppings on it for additional cost of $2-4 depending on the topping. We got sausage, mushroom, and black olive. They also have kalamata olive. I would have preferred the kalamata bc the sausage wasn't overly salty like a lot of places, so the black olive actually wasn't salty enough.   Still overall a very tasty pizza. Very thin and crisp crust, generous with the toppings, and the sauce while thin was very flavorful and a little sweet.  Even though the large is a thin crust, we still had two pieces leftover to take home. It also reheats really well.  The only minus is it seems there is only one guy that makes the pizzas. It was not a busy time while we were there, and it still took 25 mins for us to get our order.",

Service was fast and friendly, they brought some play dough, literally pizza dough (eggless) for y daughter to play with.   One thing that annoyed me but its what lots of restaurants do is, stuck is in the kid section. It's not a real section, labeled but I know they do it on purpose. It's no coincidence that four different groups, including use we're sat on the left back side of the restaurant. Parents won't get bugged by other kids, I guess is the mentality. It ended up working out though seeing as the kids make eye contact and talk keeping one another entertained.  Pizza was good, a little too thin for my liking but I know that's the authentic by style. The pesto was rich, an they really laid it on. Delicious, especially once you paired it with sausage on top. My daughters picky and she loved it. Folding the pizza in half worked for her and kept the mess to a minimum. The personal 12 inch fed her and I and left two slices leftover and came to 12 bucks. Pretty good!",

    "text": "My boyfriend was working late one Friday night so I had to fend for myself for dinner. Browsing through my bookmarks I came across Grimaldi's. It's basically a stones throw from my place, and I had heard good things, so off I went.  A couple ladies greeted me when I entered and directed me to the to-go area which is at the end of the bar. I decided to try a small pizza which is 16in, and added pepperoni, tomatoes, mushrooms and garlic. The small pizza is $14 which is just crust and cheese, and any additional toppings are $2-4 depending on what you get . My total for the pizza was $25! A bit on the pricey side. The cashier told me it would be about 20 minutes so I sat at the bar and grabbed a beer. I was disappointed they didn't have any beer specials, but I ordered a small blue moon for $5.   So 20 minutes goes by and the pizza comes out and it looks pretty good. I get home and dig in and it is just okay. I think I would have preferred it to be a little bit more well done, as my pizza was very flimsy and the toppings were a tad under cooked. Also there was hardly any cheese. I did like the crust which was thin, but not cracker thin and it had some chewiness which I enjoyed. I don't really get the hype here. It was good but nothing spectacular.",

Maybe it was actually a B, but the experience of eating there for the very first time was unpleasant, & left a bad taste in my mouth, in turn ruining the actual taste of the pizza.  We walk in & get the feeling that people probably end up here when the wait time at The Cheesecake Factory is 30 mins. or so.  Server was not very friendly, never refilled our drinks & seemed to lack training. Checked on our food, looked unhappy & said \"alright\" (no \"enjoy your meal\" or anything along those lines) when we didn't need anything. Not sure they require servers to have a \"pleasing personality\" here.. When we were done, somebody literally just saw us out -- no 4 word, 4 syllable \"Thank you, good night\", or anything like that. As if we went in there & spat on their pizza?  The one nice person in there was this guy that took us to our table & gave my 19+ mo. old son a piece of dough to play with. The 2nd star in this review is for him.  The pizza is only something to write home about if you're writing your family to tell them not to bother with Grimaldi's.  Grimaldi's, please invest some $ in training your staff.",

We were seated promptly as there was only one other table seated at the time.  Our waiter came to grab our drink order.  We ordered two diet pepsis and the waiter literally walked to the bar, and walked back with drinks which ended up being iced tea for both.  He walked away before we could say anything.  We flagged him down and told him about the mix up.  He apologized and switched the drinks out.  When I looked at my glass there was dried what appeared to be lettuce on the side of my glass.  Within 10 minutes of being here we were already on strike two.  We finally ordered our food. Make sure things are clean before opening for the day.  If one of the first glasses that go out for the day is dirty it makes me wonder how dirty the place actually is.",

Recently I visited this spot to use my free birthday gift from Grimaldi's since I'm signed up on their email club. (I highly recommend it). We ordered a plain large pepperoni and large Don Pizza with green peppers and onions (our own style supreme). We also got a large Caesar salad for the table of 3 kids and 2 adults. It was a perfect size for us and there was enough for seconds. The pizzas were more than enough for us. One pizza would have sufficed but I figure with two hearty eaters (my 14 yr old son and boyfriend), it's best to play it safe. We went home with one whole pizza but I'm not complaining because who doesn't like leftover pizza? The slices were huge and very filling. We all stopped at one and a half and if we went to one of those chain spots, we'd kill a whole large ourselves. The Caesar salad was very tasty and my 4 year old even partook in it (woot woot).  Our server was a little slow at first and didn't greet us for a while and when offering a refill on the juice did not advise that its an additional charge or that the drink did not have free refills. Manager asked how everything was as we were walking out and advise food was delicious as always.  Atmosphere was very nice with all the Christmas decor, and my kids liked the chandeliers as they were bottles. This is definitely a place to go again and again.",

We ordered a Mediterranean salad with a 18 inch pizza with extra pepperoni, extra mozzarella, and basil. This made me think of pizza on a whole other level and I've had Giordano's earlier this year and this is AMAZING. I'd highly recommend the place. Michael was our waiter and is very nice warm welcoming. Michael made sure we had everything. What's even more awesome is kids get to play with pizza dough",

    "text": "GET THE LARGE PEPPERONI & MUSHROOM WITH DOUBLE MOZZARELLA, you will want left-overs !   Tucked in between Kona Grill and Gordon Bierch is the pizzeria that made the Brooklyn Bridge famous and now you can experience EXCELLENT NY pizza here on the West Coast without waiting in a long ass line with tons of tourists on Old Fulton Street.  Just park in the strip mall and head towards the fountain and you will find one of the greatest pizzerias in Summerlin (the other one is Rocco's by Costco).  I'm born & raised NY and my taste buds have been in training all my life, I know Great Pizza.  This thin crust is cracker crisp and will stay perfectly horizontal even without folding.  Here is what separates the Grimaldi style from others:  1. They place fresh HANDMADE mozzarella slices (not shredded) on the crust FIRST 2. Sauce is drizzled on top after the toppings (white pizza does not even have sauce) 3. Oven temperature is HOTTER than hell which can soar up to 1200 degrees.  This coal oven brick pizza gives the crust that distinct charred flavor and crispiness.  Look under the crust and you will see the color that's different.   4. Pepperoni are little tiny salty slices which crisp up a bit.  SOOO GOOOD 5. When you have been in the pizza business this long, you know that there are key factors that people connotate with excellent pizza: New York style, NY water, sauce, cheese, oven temperature, etc.  Grimaldi re-creates the NY style of water by re-creating the exact mineral content of Brooklyn water to make sure the dough is just like NY.  The coal brick oven is a goldmine and permit nightmare in NYC.  It wasn't possible to install a coal brick oven in Manhattan where Grimaldi originally wanted to open his pizzeria, so he opened up in Brooklyn (coal ovens had to be grandfathered in from the building).  Under the bridge on Old Fulton Street is famous, but now with the latest lease controversy, there is the new location around the corner from the original.  Back in 1904 Lombardi opened a brick oven pizza in SOHO and you can also wait in line to compare.  In March 2012, Juliana's will be opening up in NY as another Grimaldi spin off.",

    "text": "I had a  birthday coupon for a free large pizza which is certainly a very wonderful and generous birthday offering from the fine folks at Grimaldi's Pizza!  So, a big thank you to them for a very nice treat!  The free pizza came with one topping, and I chose the basic pepperoni topping.    The restaurant is located in Boca Park which is an upscale shopping area with  various stores and restaurants.  The lot filled up fast on a weekend with nice weather, so it may not always be easy to find a parking spot. This area is quite popular!    There's a very pretty fountain in the front with outdoor patio seating which is great during nice weather.  The interior is somewhat dimly lit, but that's actually relaxing on hot Vegas days.  The decor is well designed  and there's tables along with  a few booths tucked here and there.    The pizza is thin crust,  I tend to be more of a thick crust person, however, their thin crust was nicely executed, with just enough crunch but not tough or chewy.  I expected it to have a bit more oven/smokey/coal baked flavor, so that was a little disappointing, although not a huge drawback. The sauce was okay - every now and then, the sauce tasted somewhat like meat sauce that you'd put  on spaghetti rather than typical  pizza sauce, but nevertheless was good.  As some people have pointed out, the cheese has a habit of coming off with the bite rather than sticking to the crust.  Again, not a huge drawback, just a tad annoying.  Let's put it this way:  I've had better pizza and I've also had a lot worse, so Grimaldi's certainly provides a pizza that's worth checking out.  I also ordered one of their in-house cannolli.  As seems to be the case with cannolli, most of it isn't very memorable, with a filling that didn't stand out with any particular flavor.  It contains mini chocolate chips which are tasty, and that's mainly what you taste with this cannolli.  I won't hold that against them, though, because as I say, most cannolli for some reason seems to be run of the mill.  My recommendation  would be to  try a different dessert,  such as  one of their seasonal cheesecakes or their tiramisu.   They also serve wine and beer, although I didn't try any of those offerings.  Service was outstanding, professional, friendly and helpful.  FIVE STAR on that!    I was very  happy to have had the opportunity to try this Grimaldi's and if/when I make the trek  here for a second try, I would be more adventurous with the pizza toppings, as per some of the suggestions of other posters.  Bottom line:  if you're looking for a visually pleasing, nicely upscale area to have a pizza located in Boca Park  with friends and family, this spot would certainly be one to consider and check out!",

    "text": "Mama mia...   I like pizza, I eat a lot of it. Am I the only one? Didn't think so.   Stopped by this Grimaldi's right around lunch time after my friends and I had tuckered ourselves out shopping for Christmas goodies around Boca Park. We were very hungry with visions of pizzas dancing in our heads as wen entered the rustic-looking establishment. It is not huge, nor is it small. The wooden tables and wooden decor all around make a nice, cozy feeling. I caught a glimpse of the lighting above, which are wine bottle hung from the ceiling - loved it!  As for the menu, it's straight up simple here so don't come looking for anything other than pizza, salad, or a calzone. There were no appetizers on the menu, to which I was slightly disappointed. This may be different at dinner, but I can't be sure.  Everything here is pretty much build your own pizza, which I think is pretty cool. We started with the white garlic pizza (large), added grilled chicken, fresh Roma tomatoes, fresh basil, and for a nice spicy kick - jalapenos. Often times I think fresh tomatoes on pizzas make them soggy and gross, but luckily this one did not.  The pizza came out relatively fast; it is a nice, crispy, thin pizza, with a bubbly, brown, crunchy crust. I am not a pizza-connoisseur so I am not sure what \"style\" this may be, but I enjoyed it. I think we got just the right amount of toppings, anymore and the poor pizza would not have withheld them.  My suggestions: come if you want PIZZA, straight up, nothing else. Build your own and experiment with toppings. BUT - do not go crazy, I'd say, 3 *maybe* 4 toppings at the most and make sure you're putting stuff on there that makes sense.  Overall I was pleased, between the three of us we got an amazing pizza, plenty of toppings, and splitting the bill we each owed UNDER $10. Yes. That's a damn good deal. Of course, remember, there were three of us splitting a large, so prices may vary! I will definitely come back here to try some more styles and toppings.",

    "text": "Yelp 100 Challenge * 24/100  One thing to love about Grimaldi's Pizzeria is their birthday special - a free large pizza with one free topping,  After hiking up at Red Rock last Sunday, a group of us came here famished and ready to indulge! First thing that caught my eyes were the wine bottle chandeliers, propped without their base, cap traded in for a light-bulb. They absolutely complimented the 'old town' feel of the restaurant.   We went on to order a large caesar's salad (dressing on the side), and a pizza (that came with mozarella), basil and italian sausage. Crust was thin and crispy and meat was juicy. Salad wasn't out of this world, but scrumptious nonetheless (especially after our hike!) What sparkled things (and eventually raised the rating to a 4 from what I believe should've been a 3.5) was the limited $5 Thin Mint Cookie Cheesecake made with girl scout cookies! Oh boy were they fine! Four of us shared it if I'm not mistaken, that cake slice was gone in less than minutes!  If you're up for a free pizza too, ask for an application card, fill it out and wait for their email offer a week before your birthday!",

We easily sat there for about 10 minutes and no one ever came by and asked if we wanted anything to drink. At that moment we knew whenever we saw someone just to order. Our waiter just had a very bad attitude. Like I said we love the food but our service was horrendous. Somewhat ruined our night out",

We go to Grimaldi's when we want a traditional pie. Every time we've come here, we've had a great meal. We usually get a salad, wine, and then split a large pizza. I am not ashamed to say that the two of us polish off the entire thing. The wine list isn't anything to write home about, but wine isn't the reason we come, anyway.   We prefer to sit in one of the booths in the front of the restaurant, facing the bar, because it feels more intimate there than in the larger dining area, which is usually crowded.   We've always had attentive and helpful servers, and we love the decor inside. It just feels like a neighborhood pizza joint.  We usually come for lunch on the weekends, and we've never had to wait for a table--however, it gets super-crowded for dinner on Friday nights, so plan accordingly.",

Ordered a house salad with add on Genoa Salami, they forgot the salami, asked for Chicago cut (squares) I received pie slices. We ordered 2 cocktails - it took over 15 minutes for each drink. And there was hardly any cheese on the pizza - I guess I was expecting to much, cheese on pizza who would have thought!!! That was my third time there I was hoping each time would have been better but three strikes and you're out.",

The personal is $9 plus toppings which is a deal in comparison.  Service was some of the best I've encountered, even in cities where service is king like Vegas and Orlando. Its not truly a unique NY pizza joint but I can see that conisistency and quality will keep me coming back.",

    "text": "Such mixed reviews for this place. The other locations have 4 stars and this one has a three. I\"m going to give this place 4 stars and try the other locations... THEY'RE PROBABLY 5s for me!! Yeee--!  Came here on a Friday late night and it wasn't crowded at all. Bartender was nice... gave us some nice suggestions and seemed to love his place of employment. Loved the decor. It paid homage to New York in a romantic, classy and  \"lower the lights, it's getting dim\" way.   A small Caesar salad goes a long way!!! Just a simple salad, nothing extrodinary.  THE PIZZA WAS DELISH. It's not a pizza joint where they have different types of pizza to choose from. Rather there's three types of sauces 1) Cheese and garlic 2) Tomato sauce 3) Pesto You can go halfies on these sauces on your pizza.  Then you choose the toppings. The price for this ranged from 2-4 dollars.  My pizza: Half cheese/garlic and pesto with RICOTTA cheese, sausage and mushrooms. Now the ricotta was a a nice touch but I think they could have had a lighter hand loading it on. It was a bit too much.... but the pizza was still delicious. The edges were nice and crispy but the middle wasn't so much, I think it was because of the ricctta. I could still taste the garlic after we left.   OoOooo I heard the cheese cake was good but I didn't have a chance to try it! :o/",

Not only is the pizza TO DIE for.. but the customer service speaks volumes! From the second we walked in this whole staff was ON FIRE! The manager Marla came around and greeted every table there.. and was genuine! She went WAY above and beyond and treated us to a slice of cheesecake because a big group of young soccer boys came in and she appreciated us putting up with them being a little loud! Seriously.. how nice was that! Our waiter Keith was also awesome, and knows how to give you 5 star service!!! Highly recommend GRIMALDI'S PIZZA for anyone looking for a New York style pie! We will be regulars!!! CHEERS!",

Thin crust Delicious dough and sauce is authentic so full of gourmet flavor... and I love they use fresh motzzarella...the toppings are also far from skimpy. A+ for authenticity and originality with a very common product. I am always craving their pizza.   The restaurant is cozy and romantic, they have a full bar and TV to keep up with the sports/news, nice brick and classy dining.   Highly recommended if you want a thin crust, brick oven authentic pizza, little taste of Italy...mmmmm!!!!",

The ambiance, drinks and location also add to the delicious experience. We sat at the bar and absolutely loved the bartender. Sadly a couple of days later his name slips my mind but he was the greatest. We were there on a Tuesday night for the Thew Tasting half off wines. Absolutely a great night to go. Enjoy the food, half off wine and great bartender.",

Hold your pizza pie up by the crust and it must lie perpendicular to you. The slice was slagging. Grade C- 2. Make sure the ingredients/ toppings remain on the pie. It started to droop off the dough within several seconds. Grade C-  3. When you bite into the pie, make sure there's a crunch. No crunch to be found. Grade D 4. With the bite, steam should be coming out of your mouth. Indeed it did A.   I'm sad to say, all the key components are there at Grimaldi Summerlin. I think it's all a matter of execution. Side note, the service is not the greatest from the host/bartender. We arrived to an empty dining area but the bartender and host simply chose to ignore us over their chit chat.",

It had the average 20 minute wait for a Saturday night, tables were packed, yet service was on top of things. We ordered a pepperoni mushroom pizza and the manager brings it out to us. He says \"how does this pizza look?\" We're sitting there kind of confused because it was on the extra crispy side and had a bunch of holes in it. He followed up by saying \"it doesn't look good and it's not up to our standards. We're giving this one to you for free and we're making another one for you right now. I just wanted to bring this out because I didn't want you to be hungry.\" GIVE THIS MAN A RAISE! That was the best thing I've ever heard!  Our second pizza came out and it was a tad soggy and seemingly undercooked. The food in the end was just a-ok but I felt the need to express my love for that awesome manager (the Asian one, incase you're wondering who to give a raise to Mr. Grimaldi) and give my rating a 2 star bump.   5 stars for service. 3 stars for food.",
