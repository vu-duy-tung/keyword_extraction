The place is very elegant and the  atmosphere is very roomy and quiet.  The food is very good.  Especially the popovers.  Best unique bread service I have ever tasted.  The service is super excellent.  You get one main waiter and an assistant to serve you during the entire event.  My wife and I had the following which I highly recommended: 1- Tuna Tartare 2- Jumbo Shrimp Cocktail 3-  Bone in Rib-eye (one dish can actual feed two people) 4 - Crepe Souffle  We also tried the Lobster Salad but it was okay, nothing significantly unique or special.  Will definitely come back here again next time I am in Vegas.",

I live out side of San Francisco and have eaten at many fine restaurants. This place is on the avoid list. The only thing I liked was the pop over, the drinks are gross! For a 14 dollar mixed drink it should have been shaken and then served on the rocks. My steak was cooked to how I wanted it but it wasn't impressive it was still a little a tough and was drenched in butter that's it very boring place very boring food. Go to Gordon Ramsey steak at Paris. Food service ambiance is better. The manager at this place is a slim ball. He needs to work at McDonald's. Not worth the time either 3 people no desserts and it took 2.5 hours to get through dinner never again and I want others to not make this mistake!",

    "text": "BLT Steak was the first steak house I've eaten at in at least 10 years. I was hoping it would be amazing, and it was.  The Gruyere popovers were delicious!  I rarely eat all of the bread but I ate ALL OF THE BREAD. They were crispy, cheesy, and salty in all the right ways. The duck liver pate wasn't my thing though.   We had the lobster bisque, crab cake, and an heirloom tomato, arugula, and prosciutto caprese salad to start. I believe the lobster bisque and caprese are seasonal items because they were on a different menu. I was very impressed with each item.   My filet mignon was probably the best steak I've ever had. I ordered it medium well, and it was juicy and tender inside with a crispy seasoned exterior. I ordered the blue cheese sauce in case my steak was dry or tasteless, but I didn't really need it aside from the fact that it was so yummy.  We also ordered the creamed spinach and mashed potato sides, which were perfect accompaniments to our steak.   I was most impressed with the dessert. We had the Meyer Lemon Cheesecake which came with a huckleberry sorbet, and it was out of this world.   Overall, dining at BLT Steak was a great experience that I would love to have again.",

Delicious, Tender and Flavorful beef.   First we start off with some complimentary Foie mousse.. Foie being legal so it's nice being in LV and not LA.   Then you get this amazing Gruyere popover. I crave this popover!!   I order the Shellfish tower for one which includes:  Half Lobster, crab leg, 3 oysters, 3 clams, 2 prawns. Perfect little App before my meal.   I ordered the Bone-in Ribeye that comes with bone marrow, roasted garlic and herb butter. This steak is flavorful, juicy, and exactly what you expect to taste. I must say the crust!! That crust!!! You just can't get this crust anywhere!! I've eaten everywhere. Craft, Cut, STK, Masteros. No where!!  Never been to Peter Lugers, but that's next.",

Both the BF and I ordered the Bone in Ribeye with marrow which was melt in your mouth phenomenal. I ordered the blue cheese sauce to accompany and it was sharp and rich and complimented perfectly with the beef. I also ordered the creamed spinach and that was delicious. He ordered the fries with cilantro mayo and they were fantastic. The entire table LOVED their meal, the service was pretty good considering we were a large party at it was almost 10 p.m..

The manager came out and was so nice and gracious.  He looked it over and said it would be no problem.   We were expecting a \"Sorry, but no\" response, so we were pleasantly surprised. We were planning to return later for dinner, so the manager offered to sign it so we would not have any problems.  We walked out feeling great and anticipating our return for dinner.   Dinner was fabulous!  We had the Dover Sole - it was light and flaky with a mouth-watering brown butter sauce.  Hopefully I can get that again someday, as I am already craving it.  The green beans were cooked perfectly al dente. We ate at the bar and the service was fun and friendly, yet not in any way intrusive.  Our bartender knew the perfect balance of when to visit with us and when not to.  Loved the food and the customer service was outstanding.  It was our last dinner after 5 nights in Vegas and it was the best.  A definite repeat!",

Lemonade- they use sparkling water and simple syrup, one child liked it one didn't  Caesar Salad- it had a slight sour taste, large portion definitely  enough to share  Macaroni and Cheese - cheesy goodness  Mashed Potatoes - My husband loved this, I prefer lumpiness  Brussel Sprouts- these were great, nice and tender with bits of bacon  Lemon Chicken - Not a very large portion, well seasoned and not dry  Short Ribs - No need for a knife they fell lff the bone and the sauce was great. My 8 year old ordered this and finished his plate  Lobster- steamed and then grilled, a tad dry, didn't enjoy the sauce they provided on the side. Good enough to order again.  Bone in Ribeye- they char their steaks so if you don't like it sure specify when you order or you will be unhappy. Pretty average compared to Ruth Chris, Mortons and DelFriscos  Margo our waitress made the meal. We all enjoyed our food, wish we had room for dessert. Service was impeccable and we will be back.

The staff were all roaming around and chatting with one another not being attentive to their customers. We were seated and asked if we would like drinks. I gave my order and my wife and I also wanted some water. Pretty basic. 10 minutes later and after 3 different staff members gave water to tables around us we finally had a different waiter come over and ask if we had been helped yet. We told him and he got us some water and spoke to our original waiter who then took our order. My wife's Filet mignon was perfect. However my Bone in New York was pretty much raw in the middle. MR does not mean middle raw. By the time I came to the rawness I did not send it back.  I was pretty much done with it, and the poor service. Sloppy table, they never cleaned anything up when they would pick up a plate. When everything was said and done I was charged for a dessert that I didn't order. He took it off when I pointed it out. But never again. $250 with tip for two.  Ruth's Chris is a superior Steak house, by far. Don't waist your time here.",

I also order crab cake but my waitress did not hear my order.  So, we bypassed it. -Comps:  Pate is a good start with couple slices of crunchy bread. The popover is warm on arrival.  One pop per person  It was a good bake.  Sea salt and butter is it's company. -Entrees: NY Strip 16oz (Medium is Pink, Hot Center) is perfect for my normal medium rare but it is referred as the medium here. Bone-In Ribeye 22oz (Medium Rare is Red, Warm Center) Refer to the Steak Temp on the left-hand side of the menu.  It ranges from Blue (very red, cold center) to Well Done (no pink, hot center). Sides: Onion Rings is not the kind I liked.  It is not crispy on the outside and the onion is not very sweet.  But, the onion is fresh and crunchy on the inside.  I will pass this side next time. Truffle Mashed (Potato) is heavenly smooth and infused with truffle. Dessert:  Sundaes.  I am not a sundaes person but I wanted to try something different.  Again, it surprised me.  The sundaes come in a classic tall glass with a long spoon.  The ice cream quality is high and flavors are well paired with each other.  Each bite comes with a little surprise like a piece of chocolate, or a yummy crunchy piece of candy.  If all sundaes are like this one, I will be in love with sundaes all over again.  This is a quality restaurant inside Bally's.  Tips: -Since parking is no longer free, I planned my day at and around Bally's.  We visited the Bodies exhibit at Bally's on the lower level.  Then, We walked across the bridge to Bellagio to see the water fountain, seasonal display.  By this time, it is about time for my dinner reservation here.  After dinner, we walked to Paris for a little more site seeing.  Instead of walking back to where we came from, we exit the Paris hotel & casino and walked on the strip and back into Bally's garage. -I asked if I can take the menu home with me because I like the Angus Beef Chart reference on the back of the menu.  The waitress gladly gave me one to keep.",

    "text": "BLT is a nice steakhouse tucked in the Ballys resort. We went on a Wednesday evening before seeing a show and there weren't a lot of patrons.  I got the burata appetizer and my wife got a salad. The burata was good however the dressing on the salad was overpowering. So much so that we swapped dishes because she couldn't eat it.  For our main course my wife got the filet, rare, and I got the bone in rib eye, medium. We also got green beans and mashed potatoes as sides. She enjoyed her filet as it was cooked to her liking. My rib eye was pink on the inside, however, the exterior was charred and tough.  Pros: We got a voucher from Travelzoo so we paid $115 for $210 worth of food, even though our bill was slightly over. They give you complimentary pop overs (bread with gurrier cheese) which were delicious. Our waitress was SO NICE AND KIND. She was great.  Cons: overpowering dressing on the salad and the tough exterior of my rib eye.  With so many restaurant options in Las Vegas I'm not sure I'd go back.",

    "text": "It's all about the sear. And BLT has done it to perfection. The rib eye is a 22 oz monster and is seared to perfection on all sides, leaving a soft, tender, and juicy core. Be warned - it is enormous, so save some space in your belly. Hold off on the tempting popover they serve you with butter and sea salt. Yes it is delicious but space consuming in your stomach.  Your steak deserves all the attention you can provide. Don't bother with the sauces - they provide you with a bone marrow and roasted garlic. It's all the flavor you need. Scoop some of that gooey heaven from the bone core and smear it on your steak. Or dredge your steak piece in the buttery pan they serve it in that is coated with bone marrow/garlic goodness. Perfection.  Don't make the mistake I did. Start eating from the bone - in. It's the most tender and flavorful. Because once you get to eating around 75% your belly will reach its max. Don't leave the best part on your plate.  Steak and red wine is all you need. Time to get behind the felt now - and throw some dice!",

The poppers they give you at the start....well I can't really describe them. Just so good.   I couldn't have alcohol at the time so the bartender made a mean virgin mojito. I had 2!

    "text": "What an incredible disappointment.   Full disclosure - we did have a Travel Zoo voucher, though that didn't really seem to be a problem.  I made note of it when I made my reservation on OpenTable, the hostess asked for it, and our server took the time to explain how it worked.   The service we received was impeccable.  We never once had an empty glass of wine or water.  Our server took the time to answer any and all questions. We were checked in on several times.  We were never rushed.  If this review was strictly for service, it would be 5 stars. Unfortunately, it's not.    The \"compliments of the chef\" duck pate was delicious, the shining star of the meal for me.  The popovers are served with salt and unsalted butter, and they are gigantic - much too much bread before a big meal.  Crusty on the outside, chewy on the inside.  I enjoyed them, my husband did not. The burrrata & tomato was delicious though the basil seed vinaigrette was tasteless.   The smoked bacon appetizer was very good, and a great sized portion, though the chimichurri sauce quickly became overwhelming.  The mashed potato side was extremely bland, and it's laughable that this is a sharing size.  It came out in a ramekin.    The steaks.  We each ordered the NY Strip.  There is no place on earth that a $60, aged steak, should require me to saw my way through it with force.  I should not have to eat baby sized bites because it's impossible to chew.  I should not require sauce to make it edible.  These steaks were an absolute disgrace.   We had no intention of finishing the meal, and were too full on apps, and irritated, to even bother with sending them back - because yes, both steaks were terrible, which leads me to believe this is not an isolated event.  Shame, because the service really is fantastic, but there isn't a chance in hell I'll be spending another dime in BLT - voucher or not.",

    "text": "The hubs and I came here as a result of the Travelzoo deal - which was quite a steal.   We came on a Sunday night before it got crowded and I'm glad we did. I can see how it gets crazy given it's inside Bally's. We were seated after a few minutes of waiting in the bar. The service here is 5 star and we love that.   As for the food, the popovers live up to the hype - no doubt! We had the grilled/smoked bacon, the tuna tartare, and the french onion soup as starters. We were also gifted with a small plate of pate' and crackers. It was delicious! The bacon is a must for those that love bacon. The husband had the rib eye and I had the bone-in NY strip. Husband's steak came with bone marrow and a bulb of roasted garlic! GIMME THOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOSE!! He was quickly stripped of both.  Dessert was divine. We had the banana pudding with a pecan crust and we were gifted with 2 small brownie bites. Both were heavenly - that little brownie bite was as rich as a huge slice of chocolate cake!  The quality of the beef is definitely prime and they are cooked to perfection. That said, both steaks were in desperate need of salt. We're huge fans of Ruth's Chris and are constantly looking for an equivalent and although we enjoyed BLT, the steaks just don't compare. Would we return? Probably not - there are SO many options in the area. The search continues!",

    "text": "I probably wouldn't turn down an invitation to return if a group wanted to go, the food was still decent after all.  But I would give the effort to talk everyone into a different venue all factors considered.  When determining my overall rating, I asked myself if I would choose this over Ruth's Chris up the street at Harrah's, and the answer was \"no\".     We were seated at a table with a distant view of the big specials board to the rear of the main dining room.  On my left were a bunch of douches in tank tops and shorts, while on the far right was a very casual date where the guy was sporting flip flops...with socks on!  The group of four straight ahead placed a Fat Tuesday's yard drink on the table as if it were a wedding reception centerpiece.  Classy!  I regretted not wearing my best pizza sauce stained wifebeater and fluorescent green breakaway track pants.    If brought to the table blindfolded, I wouldn't have argued had I been told this was Grand Lux Cafe.  It was only by the time our lobster cobb salad was served that I noticed the left section of the restaurant, which seemed much more secluded and dimly lit.  If I am to spend as I would at any other steakhouse on the strip, the joint should play the part.  I wouldn't celebrate an anniversary here.    One may think twice about ordering that starchy side dish after they bring out the complimentary carbs.   BLT's signature popover was a delicious detour from the traditional roll and butter.   The exterior featured a delightful burnt cheese top which I went for first before getting into the soft, doughy, croissant-like center.  I want to dive into a huge ball pit full of these and eat my way out.      As expected, the rare porterhouse was the best part of dinner.   It was very thick, sufficiently juicy, and the herb butter enhanced the overall flavor nicely.  The outer charred crust complemented the cool bloody center of each piece and made for an enjoyable chew.  It bordered on a \"Pittsburgh style\" steak which I quite like when done right.  3.75 stars for the meat.  Both sides of creamed spinach and mashed potatoes lacked in temperature and were sent back upon first taste.  Our super friendly server, Leslie, was very apologetic.  The manager, Tammy, took my wife's glass of wine off the bill as compensation which was cool of them.  It was unfortunate that the re-cooked sides didn't arrive until we were pretty close to wrapping up the meal.   One and most likely done.  I like when eating a steak on the strip feels victorious.  So much so that I want to march out with the t-bone held up high like it were the Olympic torch and Chariots of Fire music is playing.  I didn't feel anywhere close to that here.",

    "text": "The Travelzoo deal for dinner for 4 for $225 at a restaurant so well reviewed on Yelp seemed almost too good to pass up. The restaurant is at the far end of the casino away from the valet parking area, but not hard to find.  Service: almost as soon as we sat down we were greeted by a server, Hugo. He was so warm and friendly and welcoming, you wanted to make him your friend for life. What a nice man. And the service stayed at that level throughout the meal. The food Runners, the Busboys, and Hugo, all did an excellent job. Food: Hugo came to the table and explained that the travel deal coupon was good for anything on the menu up to $416. We could get appetizers entrees desserts and alcohol. If we went over by a little bit they would surcharges by that amount only. Nice!! The meal started with to passouts - a plate with pate and some bread slices and four humongous gruyere popovers. I am not a fan of pate but I can vouch for the popovers. Wow, were they good!  To start the  meal, we decided to share the tuna tartare, the grilled bacon, and the Lobster Cobb salad. The tuna tartare comes with house made very delicate potato chips. Spectacular! The Lobster Cobb was a little bit light on the lobster but also was extremely tasty. The grilled bacon was a little on the salty side but I found it to be excellent. As an entree my wife and I each got the bone in ribeye. One of our friends got the rack of lamb. Each of us found their choice of entree to be outstanding. We ordered the ribeye medium and it came perfectly cooked. One minor disappointment with the meal was the side dish of Hen of the Woods mushrooms. I found that to be rather Bland. We finish the meal with to share desserts. The praline sundae and the s'mores mousse. Delish. The only other minor disappointment with the meal was the decaf coffee which was thin and watery. Ambiance: the only reason this wonderful dining experience didn't get 5 stars. The restaurant needs seriously updated decorating. The overall ambiance here is Casino Cafe rather than upscale Steakhouse. The food and the service are on a par with or better than any Steakhouse that I've eaten in on the strip. And with the Travelzoo coupon but the price point is much much better. Highly recommended.",

It was a duck liver pate that came in little jars, which was good but there was a large shard of glass in it that I bit down on.  The server said it happens alot and got a manger that came over and said he was sorry and gave me a coupon for 20% off our next visit?  My wife ordered a coke and then we waited for both the Coke and bread service and waited and waited.  Eventually we had to ask the server assistant for both.  Meanwhile a table that sat nearly 30 minutes after us,  got their appetizers and then entrees before we got our bread and wife's coke.  I then spoke with the manager again about the slow service (it wasn't busy) and he sent out some oysters for the wait.  We had a medium rare ribeye that came out medium well and that was the end for me.  I told the manager to keep his 20% coupon because we would never come back, but he wouldn't take it,  so we gave it to the six top of guys next to us.   I would definitely not go on a Sunday night because it is clearly the B-team, from the kitchen all the way up to management.  There are so many other choices in Las Vegas and as a local, I would stay away from this tourist trap.",

A few years back they went from a traditional style steak house to a more modern style.  However, food has stayed amazing over the years.  Starter popovers and Pate' are absolutely delicious. Salad wedge, loaded baked potato, and New York strip were so generously sized that we decided to share. Steak was perfectly cooked, tender and flavorful. We got the banana cream pie last time.  We planned to again, but we're too full.  You won't be disappointed in this place.  Our server, Doug, and his assistant, were terrific!  They made a wonderful experience even better, and were genuinely making sure we were well taken care of.  He even gave us a couple brownie bites to try.  So good!  Wish we had room for dessert!!",

After thinking I've eaten at the BLT in NYC I made the move to try the one in Paris LV. Soon after ordering I realized the 60 barrels of rum I've drank in the past 40 years may have caught up with me. This was my first time at a BLT and it was awesome. The tornado (my wife) and I often order apps and one entree as we did this time. Just right for not feeling stuffed to the gills. Puffed pastry style bread is to die for. Wedge salad was, ah, a wedge salad. And the medium rare filet was cooked to perfection and delicious. Kind of crispy outside and beautifully pink inside. Enjoy life folks. Nobody gets out alive",

When we got it, we saw only 4 tables filled in the entire restaurant.  What the ... WHY Make us wait for 10mins?  Trying no to think about the outside situation, we ordered what was reviewed so greatly on Yelp, the New York bone in steak, Rib Eye, Mash Potato, and Asparagus.  New York Steak was so salty, there were a couple of bits that i had to remove because i can taste the salt.  Rib Eye Steak was slightly better, but in no way good compare the price charged. Mash Potato was blend...nothing special. Asparagus was overcooked too soft and no taste.  A VERY Disappointment with the price paid $180.",

Instead of being limited by what the Travelzoo voucher specified, we were told that we could just spend up to the amount and mix and match as we liked.  Awesome!  I was disappointed at first when they brought out bread and not the popovers I'd read about, but no fear, the popovers weren't far behind!  My steak wasn't cooked as I ordered (even after the 2nd try), but the manager gave us free dessert as an apology, so the experience wasn't ruined by that.  In addition to steak we had the beet salad (good), brussel sprouts (excellent), and pumpkin cheesecake (excellent).  They recommend a couple of sides, but we couldn't even finish the one.

Boy oh boy i was very happy with my choice. Great flavor! I ordered a side of asparagus which was cooked perfectly. They were nice and crunchy.  My friend ordered steak. The NY strip with bone in. He said it was fab! The truffle mash-potatoes were not as good as i thought they would be. My other friend's steak was not worth the price but i forget what she ordered.  The staff was attentive. If you leave to powder your nose, the cloth napkin will quickly be snatched up and refolded for your return. They also sweep off the crumbs from place setting for each course served. Kinda tedious if you ask me.  So food overall was good. However i would never go back. The prices were high and you don't get sides with your meal.",

All in all, this is a very generic steak place.  The reason why I gave this a 4 star is because other than the food tasting very good, we had an issue with how one of the steaks was cooked.  Luckily the manager was kind enough to take another person's steak and replace ours with theirs.  The service was fantastic, and got plenty of water.  However, other than the main course and sides, it is not too different from other types of steak places.  I feel this was only rated a little higher, because we got special treatment for having a Diamond Rewards Card Holder.",

I wasn't expecting much from a tucked away steak house in Bally's but believe me... it is worth the trek!!!! When you first enter you are welcomed by a large circle  bar and a welcoming bartender.  Reminder.. this girl has Celiac so I am always on the look out for outstanding GF drinks & eats.  This place did not disappoint. The first thing I had to try (happy hour 4-6 daily, all drinks , wine  & beer  are 1/2 price.  I had to try one of there signature drinks, Watermelon Basil  (usually made with Ketel One, by the bartender was very accommodating and switched it to Tito's with no problem).  This is delicious! REAL watermelon juice and basil... no syrups or flavorings.. so refreshing for Vegas! I got the chance to chat with the GM, Joseph Rich, who was very personable and helpful. I took his recommendation for a lemon vinegarette on the Lobster Cobb salad that I ordered.   I ordered Pinot Noir to go with my lobster salad, but I should have asked the bartender as it didn't pair well. I am sure he would have picked something better. On to dinner. My Lobster cob was delicious  I have to say that I could not taste any lemon  in the dressing  but the salad was still delicious, fresh and Lobster tasty. I had he pleasure of dining next to a group from Tacoma, WA who expressed to me how much they loved this restaurant and they frequented it on every visit. They LOVED their experience of Sunday brunch. I will have to try that on my next visit. I thoroughly enjoyed my dining experience and I will be back. If you are ever in Vegas be sure to find this place and tell them Cheryl from Hawaii sent you",

I was a tad skeptical at first, but if this place is good enough to book 2.5 months ahead of time, they might be on to something. They made sure to get a table with Duff--an incredibly friendly, eye-patch wearing, charismatic gentleman who never let our champagne glasses run dry and kept our tables clean and tidy the entire time we were there.   The food was also great. I have never seen cocktail shrimp all jumbo sized and perfectly peeled, nor have I ever seen such consistency with \"buffet style\" medium rare steak. Every single dish had the quality as if I had ordered the individual entree at a regular restaurant. In fact, the only critique I'd give would be that the sushi was lacking and had way too much rice for the amount of fish, but the fish itself was incredibly fresh.   The desserts are also itty bitty morsels of all kinds of sweets; I saw tiramisu, berry tart, lemon-raspberry tart, etc. Their chocolate strawberries are gigantic and absolutely amazing!  This experience was definitely one I'd go to again, though maybe in a few months/next year, as I ate so much I feel like I don't need to eat again for a long, long while!",

The Wagyu Filet is a choice cut that is always cooked perfectly. Comes with chimichurri which is so delicious. Try the loaded mash potatoes and you will be in heaven! When ordering the Hen of the Woods mushrooms, be sure to get them extra crispy with extra garlic! The surf option is a great way to go, and if you go that route choose the lobster and order the bearnaise sauce. Always top notch service with a great staff and ambiance!",

I really liked that they didn't stick to the 'rules' and let us spend the whole $178 the way we wanted to instead of 2 apps, 2 entrees, 1 side and 1 dessert. I had the 10 oz Filet Mignon and my Husband had the bone in Rib Eye. In addition we had the bacon app, 2 wedge salads, baked potato and Mac n Cheese. I have two complaints about the place...I ordered an Arnold Palmer - horrible, it tasted like straight lemon juice. The server only got me more ice tea but it didn't help, I just ended up drinking the ice tea. Not a huge biggie, just a drink. I had the Mac and Cheese as my side. It was so gross, I took two bites (the second to make sure it wasn't just a bad bite) and didn't touch it again. The worst Mac and Cheese I've ever had, it tasted rancid and there was a distinct nasty texture, like it was made from a box (but worse) or something. Other then those two things, our steaks were fantastic and cooked perfect!",

Ordered their signature cocktail, the BLT, and thought it was pretty good. For food I only ordered the bone-in ribeye.   Before the steak came I was served \"the popper\" (bread) which I didn't try, however being a diamond member, I was also served the duck pate, cheese bread, and charcuterie.  The duck pate with bread was unbelievable and very bold and strong. The cheesebread was light and good as well, very good contrast to the bread and duck pate. The charcuterie was as expected and didn't stand out.  For the main course I ordered the ribeye medium, but was given to me medium rare, so I sent it back to be cooked to order. I have to say the steak was over charred which someone else posted about ina previous review. The steak wasn't melt in your mouth as I would've expected being a USDA prime steak. It was a good steak, but the fat and the flavor (I had no sauce) was nothing to comment about. The bone marrow added flavor to the steak, however I could not comment about the butter which was melted and gone since I sent the steak back.  Overall, for being a restaurant known for its steak, it was nothing to rave about. I'd say I most likely won't be back to spend $65 on a ribeye steak   that I thought was average at best.",

Creamy tuna with just the right amount of soy and avocado. and and crunch.  And the Crab cakes.  Flawless. Wagyu fillet was cooked masterfully.  One of the best steaks I've ever had.  Seriously.

Our waiter was very attentive and we were seated at a table against the wall. We had a Travelzoo voucher that was money will spent.   We started with the beautiful popovers that were piping hot. Cute recipe came with it.   Amuse Bouche of duck liver pate. Not my fave but then again not a live pate fan  Appetizer was Burrata toy box tomatoes and fresh mozzarella (this is on my top ten favorite things I've ever eaten) the tomatoes were unlike any I'd ever had before. Sweet and tart at same time. It was addictive.   My spouse  and I then split the Lobster Cobb which was more than enough for two and relishes.   I ordered petite filet with potato skins which was great but a tiny bit dry even tho it was cooked perfectly. Needed butter. I was to full to eat potatoes by this time which is probably why I thought my steak was just pretty darn good lol. I'd still say everything was perfect.   Hubby had bone in ribeye and bone marrow as well as a potato baked. He devoured it. Medium rare and perfect.   I didn't want dessert. Ok I'm lying of course I wanted dessert I'm on vacation :). If it's on the menu and you don't order it then shame on you. Seriously your loss. Best dessert of my life. Banana cream pie. Hmmm really you ask?  Yes really. Pecan crusted banana cream pie. I dream of this pie.   Go. It's not cheap. Paying full price will set you back 240$ for what we ordered but it was an event if two hours and put me to bed early so saved easily that much gambling!",

    "text": "An unexpected surprise! I was visiting Las Vegas after seeing Hamilton and wanted a fine dining experience after the show and stumbled across BLT. We were a party of 4 and all the dishes were flavorful and cooked to perfection. Even though the food was nearly perfect, what really elevated our experience was the service from Roxanne and our food running Jamie.  No one had to ask for a refill, they had extension menu knowledge, they were thoughtful and courteous and they made us feel extremely welcomed.   There's a robust list of options in Las Vegas and unfortunately, pretty modern restaurants are always the hottest buzz however this hidden gem at Bally's was a 5-star from start to finish!",

Dessert was banana cream pie and the pie filling had the consistency of whipped cream instead of custard.  If you don't think you can finish off a big steak, then order a smaller one. Its not worth the price to take leftovers and trying to heat it up later.  Fortunately we had a voucher that gave us a little relief from the $200 bill. This is a dinner only place so make a reservation if you feel like it because it filled up pretty quickly.",

We started with the tuna tartar which was average at best, however the bread poppers were very good.

They brought duck pate, which was fantastic, followed by their amazing bread (Seriously was my favorite part.) Drinks were on point. My husband and I both ordered the wedge salad and were not disappointed. We then both ordered the 10 ounce filet, and that probably was our least favorite part of the meal, although still good. We just figured when you pay $56 for steak it should be absolute perfection, and it was not. It was good, but definitely left us wanting something better. The ambience was the perfect steak house ambience. And the staff was attentive and friendly (although our server was a little pushy at times when we didn't order extra sides or dessert.)",

Supposedly everyone loves the popovers, I wasn't impressed at all.  They tasted burnt and salty.  The duck liver mousse was good though.  I lied to my friend so he would try it.  If we weren't in public I think he would have spit it out!  My friend was disappointed because they don't serve prime rib but he managed and was happy with his steak.  My filet was salty and not the best meat for what they charged.  I didn't even finish it and I love red meat.  Drew loved his steak and the bone marrow.  The side dishes were good too.  Try the Brussels sprouts with bacon and honey.  So good!  The Mac and cheese was good, which isn't on the main menu.  Highlights...easy to get into, casual atmosphere, good service. Low points....better steak places for the money",

    "text": "The week prior to going to Vegas I saw Travelzoo had a special for BLT steak.  $115...on the travelzoo it did say it had a bunch conditions to choose from like 2 appetizers,2 entrees, dessert with an up to value on each that totaled up to $208  I normally find those to be annoying but since I have been to BLT  restaurants, I found it to be a good value.  I was happy when I arrived to find out those conditions were thrown out and it was straight credit of $208.   The wife had a large and meaty crab cake for an appetizer and I had the tuna tartae, tuna and avocado were fresh. A complimentary appetizer of duck pate with a jam (or jelly) was a welcome treat as well. Entree wise she had the branzino and I had the filet (medium) and an add-on of crab. She really enjoyed her branzino. My steak was cooked perfectly.  Sides were hen of the woods mushrooms (this is a must order for me at any BLT with it on the menu) and  fingerling potatoes which were excellent.   SIDENOTE: There is something about BLT that I just love their filet. I had ny strip one time that I did not really enjoy so I have stuck with Filet since then.  Wait staff was very friendly and provided great service. Any recommendations or explanation of an item she provided with great knowledge.  We had quite a few cocktails unfortunately I don't remember the name but mine had tequila and mezcal.  Personal Pet Peeve: This is why it 4 star and not 5.  I know this occurs at steakhouses often but I still don't like getting charged for steak sauces. It just seems like a nickel & dime type of thing when you are spending $100 a person imo.  At the end of the day our bill came to about $265 after tax & 20% tip.",

Not enough \"mouth feel\" for a wagyu! And wine recommendation was flat with a Gallo Cabernet for $85! Try lowering the prices to be realistic. That bottle of wine was mediocre and cost less than $20 retail. A real rip off! Atmosphere = none. For these prices ( nearly $600 b4 tip) I expected much more! Many other steakhouses downtown especially the \"D\" and the steakhouse at Palace Station ( Charcoal room) are a much better value!",

Since I don't like steak that wasn't an option  I am a value guy.  I don't mind spending money if I get value for it.  Well we got value for half the meal.

    "text": "I will never make the mistake of returning to this restaurant. And by never, I truly mean NEVER.  Got in on a Saturday and snagged a 7:30 reservation. My party arrived at 7:25 to check in, and we still had to wait a good 10 minutes before being sat down. Because we had to be at the Aria by 9, we figured a solid hour or hour-and-fifteen dinner would be enough, but boy, were we wrong.   Though we were presented with pate and crostinis to start (\"compliments of the house\") and some delicious, fresh-baked popovers, it took at least 15 minutes for our order to be written down, which I personally found ridiculous since we knew right off the bat what we wanted to eat. So, let's get to the bad, the awful, and then the worst.  Bad: 1) Drinks took FOREVER to arrive. And by drinks we mean some sodas, a lemonade, one beer and one glass of wine. We had to ask where our drinks were. Seriously?! Also, they don't serve lemonade, but the waiter eventually brought a lemonade to my sister-in-law. Apparently he grabbed it from the restaurant next door...? 2) The waiter avoided us like the plague, which we found insulting. If I'm paying $60 for a cut of steak, you better show me $60 service!  Awful: 1) Literally everyone in the restaurant was eating except us. People who sat down after us were serviced quickly; people in shorts, flip-flops and sweats were getting their food left and right. Yet the well-dressed table of five with smiling faces couldn't catch a glance! 2) We flagged the manager down after 45 minutes of waiting to let him know what was up. He tried calming us down, but when he promised the food would be out in \"5, 10 minutes\" and it didn't happen, we felt bamboozled. That, and HUNGRY AF.  Worst: 1) We were there for an hour and ten minutes and NOTHING HAPPENED. We left starving, angry and ready to complain. 2) We decided to never come back.  Hey, BLT Steak, thanks for ruining our night. Nothing like leaving a an expensive restaurant starving your face off.",

American Wagyu Rib eye 12oz at $92: Amazing taste, juicy and very tender. You can definitely taste the quality of meat. Highly recommended in median-rare if you are a steak lover.  Bone in Rib eye 22oz at $55: This one comes with bone marrow which is very tasty and flavorful.    28-days Dry aged Bone-in NY 20oz at $61: Nicely cooked for the central part, but I don't like the burned bitterness of the surface.  Filet Mignon 10oz at $56:   Very thick piece, perfectly cooked to pink.   Sides: Creamed spinach & Grilled asparagus $11 each, Baked potato (creamy, rich, and tasty) $9. Lobster bisque is great, too, but there is no lobster chunk.   Passion Fruit crepe souffles: Rich filling but with fresh taste of passion fruit sauce, a great dessert with generous size to share.  Alcohol: Highly recommend the watermelon basil, brilliant color with brisk mouth-feel.  Complimentary appetizer platter: dry-aged beef, prosciutto, salami with duck liver and honey dip is remarkable and with beautiful presentation.   Complimentary desserts: lollipop cake and brownie, too bad that we were too full to finish them.",

Margo was the best and so was everyone else that was helping her at our table. Everyone was very attentive, friendly and fast.   There was a good selection on side orders and all tasted very good.  All of the steak and seafood we ordered was delicious!   We even had a VIP chief tasting that was free. Dessert was even given for free at the end for all 9 of us.     We had a party of 9 and had a booth all to ourselves. It was great!  We were celebrating two birthdays at this dinner and we will come back next year to do the same.",

To drink, I had the Old Cuban who included dark rum and other mixture. It was cool. I actually enjoyed a few of them.  I would recommend this place again because it exceeded my expectations.

Wandered through Bally's in a tired, slightly-hungover and starving state seeking an upscale place for appetizers and stumbled upon this gem. Lawrence, the GM, was about to escort me to a seat when he was rudely interrupted by a patron who clearly did not fit the intended audience of the restaurant and chose to start a scene regarding how she felt \"disrespected\". He promptly attended to her concerns and was apologetic for the disruption and my inconvenience. He sat me in a secluded seating area and recommended the tuna tartar. It also included a to-die-for popover with Gruyere geese and butter which paired with an IPA was a quick fix for my lingering hangover. I'm so glad I stumbled into this surprise inside Bally's.",

It's dimly lit, wine bottles lining the walls and creating a beautiful atmosphere.  The service seemed a little slow, otherwise I would have given five stars. I ordered a cocktail, the bees knees to begin. It was gin, lemon, honey, and egg whites for texture. It was delicious but took probably 10 minutes to come out, and the restaurant had maybe seven tables seated. The staff was very accommodating as the first table we were seated at was next to a party of four very loud, and raunchy people. Seriously - the conversations they were screaming for all the restaurant to hear made me very uncomfortable. I couldn't even talk to my friend across the small table without yelling! The waitstaff reseated us in a different room, were extremely polite and understanding, we were very thankful for that.  They brought out a complementary duck liver mousse with crostinis, it was to die for. Very creamy, a nice way to start the meal. They also brought out two popovers that were moist and fluffy. You could taste the egg and I devoured mine. They also attached a tag with recipe and instructions on how to make them at home. (Nice touch)  I ordered the filet mignon, medium rare, with stuffed mushrooms as a side. I ordered a Cabernet to drink. My companion ordered the New York strip steak, medium rare, with a baked potato.  My steak was perfectly cooked, the spices in the crust perfectly complimented the flavors of the filet. It was melt in your mouth delicious. The little stuffed mushrooms were tasty as well but I was so full I only ate two. Overall, aside from the noisy table we were initially sat by and the service running a tad slow, it was a perfect steak dinner.",

That doesn't get you any sides or anything so I paid $12 for a fully loaded baked potato in which I had to put the toppings on, myself. I'm not saying I'm lazy. Trust me, I have no problems with putting on my own toppings but if I'm paying $12 for a fully loaded baked potato, I expect the toppings to already be on my potato before it's brought to my table. I swear that my wallet went into cardiac arrest. The steak I ordered was the bone in ribeye, which our server, Sergio, had said was the house special. What was so special about it besides the price? Hell if I know. If you're looking for a great steak experience, got to Fogo De Chao or Texas De Brazil instead. Those fools know how to cook steak. If you're looking for mediocre steak at a ghastly price, then look no further than BLT Steak. I will say though that the service was excellent and Sergio was most attentive.",

Liver totally grosses me out and my bf forced me to try it and it wasn't bad nor good but he liked it. The bread was super fresh, warm and crispy. The salad was very good as well.  The service was beyond excellent! Everyone very friendly. Atmosphere was classy, simple, and romantic. We will definitely come back again.

Since we were so disappointed with our visit to Ramsay's, we were both going to BLT with such low expectations.  The group decided to go to Bally's to play at the tables a bit before dinner so my best friend decided to check out BLT.  He was told that the vendors are the same as Ramsay's steakhouse, so we were iffy on going but since we were already waiting we just went with it.  We already knew what we wanted.  We got the duck fat fries, mac and cheese, creamed spinach, mashed potatoes, he got the bone in ribeye and i got the rack of lamb.  We were also given duck pate which was delicious and their gruyere popovers were so good.  So far so good.  Our sides came with our entrees.  I didn't like our duck fries, they were wedges instead of actual fries.  I think it would have been a lot better if they were actual fries.  The mashed potatoes were good, the cream spinach was okay, and the mac and cheese wasnt too bad.  The lambs were cooked to perfection and his ribeye was nice and juicy.  We were in and out of there in an hour.  Our visit was so much better than Ramsay's place and it was cheaper too.",

Both were very tasty.  Ordered the massive 22oz ribeye medium rare.  It is a giant chunk of meat.  I'm not surprised that some of it was probably closer to rare than medium rare, but it was really fantastic and I wasn't complaining.  Sampled a number of sides with the steak:  mushrooms, potato skins, and creamed spinach.  The popovers that they bring out are fantastic!  They even give you the recipe if you want to try to make them at home.  We shared the chocolate tart and peanut butter chocolate mousse for dessert.  Both were solid choices.  Ballys may not be one of the newer casinos and the food isn't quite 5 star worthy, but it is very good and an excellent value, particularly if you get the Travelzoo voucher.  Oh, the service was top notch.  I regret that I didn't remember to catch the name of our server.",

    "text": "Being from Texas, we were a little aprehensive about going to a steakhouse in Las Vegas.  Almost immediately, our aprehension disapeared and turned into excitement.  The restaurant was very nice and elegant.  It was a little dark at first but our eyes adjusted quickly and it became apparant that BLT takes pride in their restaurant.  We spent the next few minutes admiring the decor and layout.  We were greeted by Leslie and Conrad (a great team I might add), and the experience just got better.  Conrad went to filling drinks while Leslie took the time to explain the menu and make suggestions (with no pressure).  All we can say is....WOW!  These two made an amazing team and really took care of us; and to be honest, even if the food was just good - because of them we would still come back.  Now to the food, they started us out with a couple popovers, then followed by pate.  Shortly after that we had our mixed drinks (Old Cuban's, which are kind of like a hybrid between a Mojito and a Long Island, very good!).  The popovers were nothing short of amazing (and they give you the recipe!) and the pate made me want to move in.  I know it sounds bad but I wouldn't let go of the dish it came in until it was clean (no REALLY).  Next, we split a delicious salad, while still being pampared by Leslie and Conrad.  Finally came the steak (the Porterhouse for 2).   It was perfectly cooked (medium is our preference) and already sliced for sharing.  We also got two sides, truffle potatoes and stuffed mushrooms, both are a must!  At the first bite, we were hooked!  After all that food, we still finished all 36 mouthwatering ounces.  For dessert, we were too full so they brought us two amazing little brownies that satisfied our dessert cravings.  We cannot recommend BLT Steak enough!  It is already on our return list for next time we are in Las Vegas.",

The lamb was my favorite! Packed with flavor and perfectly cooked. To top things off we had a piece of the banana cream pie. It was amazing!

In comparison to Hell's Kitchen (which is speechless amazing) and even Burgr, this place was not the best. We had the porter house for two and added onion rings, mushrooms and peppercorn sauce. The meat was well cooked but much too salty on the seasoning in certain areas. It was like they only seasoned sections and didn't rub it in evenly. The onion rings were so heavily battered we actually pealed all the breading off cause it was too much. The mushrooms were delicious but portions were tiny. The peppercorn sauce was overly sweet which was strange and didn't taste pepper at all so we weren't sure if got the correct sauce.  Overall, the servers were nice but not nearly as attentive or professional as Hell's Kitchen. Don't think I would come here again.",

    "text": "We are in Las Vegas for a convention this week, and it's a rare moment that we get to dine sans our amazing but boisterous kiddos, so chose BLT Steak after reading the great reviews. The hostess seating us was very nice. But our waiter Omar was another story. Note to restaurant: don't offer a Travelzoo coupon if your staff is going to treat us like garbage when we use them!!  We didn't know that we had to tell the hostess about the travelzoo so when we told our waiter before we even ordered, he immediately changed his tone. Then he lectured us about how we had to tell the hostess. While you can use it for anything you want, there are a few exceptions. Unfortunately wagyu is also not allowed which was one of the reasons why we chose to eat here. Oh well - but that's not the reason for the bad review.  As the waiter proceeded to take our order, he did ask if we had an allergy. We said no, but we have very strong preferences and dislikes, so please let us know if there are any strong flavors in food like wasabi, horseradish, onions, curry, etc. We then ordered two appetizers: the Tuna Tarter and the Steak Tarter - and asked if there was anything like that in them - he said no. Well, of course the Steak Tarter was swimming in a brown sauce suspension I asked him what it was and he said \"traditional garnishes\". I pressed further and he said \"mustard\". So apparently us listing every strong spicy flavor known to man didn't clue him in that he should have told us about mustard that wasn't listed as a flavor on the menu. Had to send that back, but the Tuna Tarter was excellent.  We also has amuse bouche of liver pate with some kind of gel with 2 small pieces of toast. Not great. Textures of runny pate with gel made it taste like snot. Don't really like starting off with that profile. Then popovers (which usually are my fav) were overcooked to a crisp and really dense inside. First time I didn't finish a popover.  Then came the entrees. We ordered a filet mignon and bone in ribeye. Both were good, but the ribeye was too lean and didn't have a cap on it. It was somehow trimmed to just the eye. Never had that issue at a steakhouse before. It did come with a small piece of marrow and garlic - which helped. Filet was good though.  Side dishes were comically small for $12 each. They are not sharing sides. We ordered the truffled mashed and seasonal special cauliflower. Cauliflower was disappointing. Just tastes like the ones I bake in an oven - there was no brown butter or lemon zest as described.  We then ordered the peanut butter chocolate mousse - which is not a mousse. It was so dense and hard that I almost needed a knife to cut through it. The bowl of sorbet was like they emptied an entire container into a bowl. Just really odd. Could have done with 1/2 the amount at 1/2 the price.  Drinks we had two mojitos and one wine spritzer. Asked for fruit in the spritzer but the bar doesn't have any - just garnishes like limes, orange slices, cherries. Odd, but okay.  But the real issue we had was service. The waiter never checked on us. I had an empty glass of water for over an hour. He was just literally throwing food on our table and walking away with no explanation of what anything is. No asking if the food was fine. At one point, he stepped on my foot when putting food down and didn't even apologize. I understand that maybe people don't tip right on a coupon or voucher, but we weren't those people. And to treat us like garbage was a really bad way to earn a tip. We did end up giving almost 15% tip because my husband doesn't really like giving less than that. But if it was up to me, it would have been a 0 - we've had better service at Denny's.  Another table near us also has a Travelzoo and that waiter was great to them. I wished we had him instead of Omar - who instead literally ruined our date night. I would not return to BLT Steak, and I do not recommend this restaurant until they train their staff properly.",

Sunday, May 27, 2018 ( Memorial Day Weekend) We decided to eat here around 530pm, before our show.  All tables were reserved, but there was seating at the bar.  The bar is at the front of the restaurant.  After we ordered our cocktails, they served their Signature Poppers. This bread was so airy, warm and delicious, and had gruyere cheese baked in.  This has to be the best bread I've had in my life. Add a little butter, and it melts in your mouth.   I ordered their Tuna Tartar appetizer,  which was not just delicious, but amazing presentation.  Tuna on top of avocado, and served with crisps.  We split a Lobster Cobb Salad, which had large Lobster Claws.  Nice tasting salad, and large enough to split for 2 people.  After getting full from the bread, appetizer and salad, we awaited our 28 day aged New York Strip Steak, and ordered a side of cream spinach.  Steak was cooked perfected, and flavor was excellent.   Sides are not included with the Steak, but you may not need it because their poppers (bread) can fill you up.  Warm Poppers - Complimentary Tuna Tartar - $20 Lobster Cobb Salad - $24 New York Strip 16oz - $63 Creamed Spinach - $12  Total with cocktails - $145  Dress Code  Casual, ok to wear jeans, but I wouldn't wear swimsuits to this establishment.  Staff & Service Very friendly and fast service  Reservations I would definitely make a reservation, as all tables were booked  Food American Bistro - Excellent  Large menu  I recommend this Restaurant if you are looking for a good steak and want upscale flair. I will be going here again because of excellent customer service and food.  Food was served in good sized portions.",

    "text": "After a long week of traveling and work in Vegas,  I decided to treat myself to a steak.  I was there alone and the thought of taking a steak up to my hotel room and ravaging it in my bed while watching Forensic Files was very appealing.  The high reviews on yelp had me really excited, so I sat at the bar, and ordered a bone in rib eye to go.  The bartender was very friendly and told me about 30 minutes.  The steak was $64, which I was ok, with thinking it would be a 4-5 star meal.  Sadly I was underwhelmed once I got that piece of meat back up to my room.    The char on the steak was wayyyy too thick and crusty, it overpowered the beautiful natural taste of the rib eye.  I was really surprised and disappointed.  I had not eaten all day and ate a few bites, but just tossed the rest (my dog would be so pissed at me) .  I have had some really excellent steaks in Vegas and this was by far the worst and felt like a waste of money and my fantasy of devouring a beautiful steak in my hotel room after a long week of work.     Maybe it was an off night, because the couple next to me as I waited ordered short ribs and had to send them back and were so bothered they did not want another.   Also, lame no sides come with the steak.  Would not recommend. Sad!",

Starting the meal, the complimentary popover was so fluffy delicious and salt and butter added that extra element. For my entree, I ordered the branzino and mac and cheese. The Branzino was perhaps the most delicious fish I've had at a restaurant with it being perfectly seasoned and deliciously crispy skin. Mac and cheese was good but, if there was a fault, I'd say it needed more bread crumbs on top. I wasnt able to finish the mac and cheese because of how filling it was (you could enjoy one order for 2+ people).  Service at the bar was wonderful. The bartender told me I was at the end of happy hour, half price drinks including wine, so I ordered a glass of wine. Bartender asked if I liked the glass and said he'd be more than happy to add another drink at happy hour price for me to enjoy later (since I was still, barely, in the HH window). There were several people working there and checking on me.   I will be back for that Branzino. I know my husband will enjoy this place and I cant wait to take him here.",

So if we ever find ourselves back here in the future we both will order the 10 oz filet instead of the porterhouse for two. We got a side of mashed potatoes and green beans. They were both delicious and I am convinced the mashed potatoes were the best I've ever had in my life. I would go back just for those! The popover you get before your meal was really good too, I've never had one before. It was a nice place for a fancy dinner while on our honeymoon.",

For my appetizer I had the crab cake which was very flavorful however do not order if you're not a fan of onions. For my main course I ordered the filet Mignon medium rare plus which was cooked to perfection with truffle mashed potatoes.

Don't know his name, older short man with glasses during evening service during weekday.  At least 3 times when I very politely asked for something (a side sauce, remove the extra wineglass, get a to go box), I was told with a straight face 'NO.' 'WHY?'  I was just shocked. Never have I had this even at McDonald's. then he followed with 'of course you can' as if it were funny.   I came here for a fine dining experience, not to banter or entertain you at my expense.    You barely attended to us, you ignored stacks of empty dishes on our table. If you were remotely competent I might have overlooked the attitude.   As CET diamond I received complimentary appetizers from another waiter, who also jokingly pushed back when I nicely asked for a to go box.  This must be going around the staff.  I told him I already got the humor from the first guy so he backed down, though I still had to justify for 2 minutes on why I needed a box.  I take it this is some form of passive aggressive stress relief to treat customers like sh*t, jokingly tell them 'NO' when you are asked to do something?! I'm not laughing.    Save your attitude and poor humor, it's unprofessional and we don't have time for it.   Customers get few opportunities to come out for a good experience. My time is valuable and this isn't exactly pocket change.  You just ruined my night.  Don't bother going there unless you want to chance the same.",

Our server, Jonathan, was one of the worst servers I've ever encountered. I'm a server myself, so I am very critical. The place was empty for a Saturday night, we made reservation but walked right in.  We placed our drink order and food order at once, which I can't stand. I would like a glass of wine while checking out the rest of the menu.  It took 20 minutes for the drinks to come - our appetizer and salads came out before our drinks!!  We were livid!  We had to ask where our drinks were.  Never at one point did our server ask how we were doing, how our food was or if we needed anything else like drinks or napkins.  We would've loved another round of drinks, but were never even given the opportunity to order another. At one point during our meal, he actually stood over on the other side of our table and stared at us eating talking to himself of what he needed to do next.  I don't know if this server was new or not; but we didn't care.  We were so unhappy with the service and did not expect this from a 5 star steak house where our bill was $200. Unfortunately, it put a bad taste in our mouths and we won't be back because of it.",

I dined here with my two children and they absolutely love it as well. We started off with the popovers which came with a cute little recipe on the back. These popovers are melt in your mouth buttery cheesy goodness made in heaven. For appetizers we ordered the bacon which was phenomenal and the Ahi tuna which left me speechless. The waitress highly recommended the Ahi tuna and sincerely it's the best I Ahi tuna that I have ever had in my entire life. Fresh, tasty, and simply delicious. As our entree we the fillet and my son had the salmon. Phenomenal and cooked to perfection. The entire dining experience was just phenomenal. Their cocktails were also great!

All I can say about that is WOW!  The cocktail list was inventive and far from the usual and everyone who had one of the special cocktails enjoyed them.  Sergio our waiter was terrific and attentive without being bothersome - we really enjoyed our dinner at BLT.",

Everything I had was really quite good.  I had the bone in NY Strip, and beet salad.  They also served some puffy bread after dinner that was pretty good.  I could've eaten many more, but I was getting full.  A few glasses of wine, a big hefty meal, and a bunch of drunk dudes - it keeps the entertainment quotient up.  Our server was very cheery, helpful, and all the guys liked her.    The one thing they need to work on is the decor and vibe.  Right now it's a bit cafeteria like.  I'm exaggerating a little bit, but the atmosphere really keeps this place from getting a top rating from me.  I would definitely go back and check it out again.l",

It had a really intimate feeling - perfect for a date.   For appetizers, they gave us duck pate and crackers, which were interesting. They also gave us their pop overs, which is just puffed up bread with cheese. It also came with a card with the recipe to make them. I got the Braised Short Ribs and a side of mashed potatoes. Both were really delicious. The meat tasted buttery and melted in my mouth.   It's a bit on the expensive side, but the food is amazing. My parents had an amazing time.",

    "text": "My husband took me out for a birthday celebration (29 once again ). Wonderful ambiance, though a tad noisy. Service is absolutely impeccable. Fantastic, generous and delicious portions, next time we will probably split everything!   To start they bring you their famous Gruyere popovers, hot from the oven with room temperature butter and sea salt for the perfect crusty bite!  A plus was a wallet sized recipe was included :-).   He had the spinach salad, with delicious maytag blue cheese and bacon (spelled YUMMY).  I had the Bibb lettuce salad with mustard dressing. Shoe string bits of manchego cheese along with paper thin slices of raw beets and radish. One bite tasted like possible fennel, I wished for more of that flavor. The mustard dressing did not have as much bite as I like. The salads are quite large and I think next time we'll split the spinach.    There are no steak options less than 10oz which is a bit much for me.  I got the filet, he got the wagyu flat iron. Definitely go for the wagyu next time. They offer sauces, I got peppercorn, he got bernaise. We both preferred the flavor of the steaks alone. The peppercorn was slightly sweet and off putting. The bernaise was rich and overtook the steak rub.   Now about the sides....oh my Lord God, thank you for the creation of Brussel sprouts and butternut squash. They were both divine. Butternut squash is prepared as a smooth puree with brown sugar. Brussel sprouts are sauteed with onion, bacon (aka yummy) and drizzled lightly with honey. Honestly I could have had entree sized portions of these two items and would have been delighted. They are both a must try if you see them on the menu. We sadly had to skip dessert as we had to make it to a comedy show (Tony Baker is hilarious).  A fabulous discovery, we will definitely be returning!! Highly recommended!!",

Their steaks were the most disappointing. While it came out on a cast iron skillet, it did NOT sizzle with the usual amazing butter aroma. Instead, the bone-in strip AND filet mignon were room temperature and tasteless. It was the toughest piece of \"prime\" meat I have ever had. Even worse, while cutting into it, you did not get that juicy pink center.... instead we got a very dry brownish pewter color. Signs that it was a very old cut of meat and maybe should've been thrown out. We wasted a dining experience here and I felt responsible for taking my party here. Coming from California, I felt defeated for not being able to source a better place to dine. With only one night left in Vegas, I will have to knock it out if the park tomorrow night. Walking down the strip ONE whole day AFTER the terrible experience, I can't help but feel remorse and regret for ever taking my family here. They will NOT let me forget what a terrible experience this was and now, they do NOT trust my judgement what so ever for other recommendations. BLT, you guys have failed me miserably and please, hire a new Chef or create different recipes that might not associate a steak on the menu. I am certainly surprise that you are still in business.",

The wait staff was extremely slow, our food came out in fragments, so it was lukewarm. There was 1 server for 2 tables of about 11-12....no one really enjoyed their dining experience. When concerns were bought to 2 members of the management team, they were brushed off. To add insult to injury, I was unhappy with how my steak was prepared & 2 different staff members came over to give me an impromptu lesson on how a steak is supposed be prepared. When I told them I knew how I wanted my steak prepared, the manager proceeded to tell me about people of color in her family, so she knows how we like our steak. That was racist & insulting. I asked to speak to her supervisor, he basically defended her response. I've tried reaching out to Cesar's Entertainment to voice my utter disbelief & anger with not only the service, but with the off color conversation. I've had no response & no luck getting any kind apology for that aggregrieous comment. Very disappointing experience. Will not be returning. Definitely would NOT RECOMMEND!",

The dining room decor is very dark and intimate while the bar is more upscale and modern. The meal always starts with their famous popovers which is a bread made with cheese. They also bring out sliced French bread with various kinds of meat jelly which is surprisingly pretty good. We also really like the bacon appetizer. Being a steakhouse, that's usually my go-to entree order and they definitely make some of the best steaks I've ever tasted. If you're feeling speedy, try the wagyu beef, it's delicious. For dessert, I cannot recommend the crepe souffle enough. It is light, a bit eggy, and very sweet. They top is with a passionfruit sauce that can sometimes be a bit overpowering and so I recommend ordering it on the side. Overall, I would definitely recommend BLT for a special occasion or date night. The price is steep but the atmosphere and food quality are definitely worth it.",

    "text": "After attending a Yelp Elite event here last year, I have been craving BLT's incredible popovers ever since! They are the way to my heart!   We checked in promptly for our reservation and were seated a few minutes later. I will have to say before I venture on to what we ordered and ate that the service here was really poor. We were inside the restaurant close to three hours because we were constantly waiting on our server.   After being seated, we were served with waters and menus. We waited about ten minutes to put in a drink order and receive those delicious popovers. These things are what other bread baskets look up to. Big, warm, crusty, cheesy buns served with softened butter and an overly large sea salt canister that means business.   Once these beauties arrived, we waited another ten minutes for our drinks. When they were delivered we asked our server to please take our order not knowing when we would see him again.   We ordered the tuna tartare, the wedge salad, the filet mignon, bone-in rib eye, Brussels sprouts, loaded baked potato and banana cream pie.   The tuna tartare was incredible. Served up with a soy lime dressing on fresh avocado and a side of potato chips, this dish is the perfect combination of sweet and tangy. I loved the unusual side of chips to eat this dish with. The tuna was fresh and the portion was just right.   The wedge was also delicious, with a nice creamy blue cheese dressing, huge pieces of salty bacon and tasty tomatoes on a large portion of crisp lettuce.   Our steaks were both cooked perfectly with a nice char on each and herb butter that doesn't make you wonder where the additional sauce is. You can order sauces of course, but we didn't as the purists that we are. Both steaks were seasoned well with salt and pepper and an even temperature all the way through.   Our sides were sub par. I thought the Brussels sprouts were overly sweet and needed a little more cooking, the loaded potato was like any other and nothing made it stand out to me.   The banana cream pie was not your typical and one of their most popular dishes. The crust is filled with walnuts and cinnamon, large slices of banana with a cream filling and homemade whip cream and caramel sauce! It was a nice way to end your meal without overly indulging on something really heavy.   Back to our service, our plates and waters were never cleared or filled in a timely manner. Our appetizer dirty dishes sat there until our main course arrived. Our main dirty dishes sat there for thirty minutes once we were done. At one point a manger noticed and came over and cleared them for us. During the time we waited, we watched our server pass us several times and not come over. We finally flagged him down asking for our check because we had been sitting there so long without being noticed or helped.   I know they were busy, but I hope that doesn't mean their service is always lacking. I love the food here but I can't spend three hours at a restaurant when a meal should take about half that.   Needless to say, those popovers might have me coming back and grabbing a seat at their bar.",

    "text": "Consistently my favorite steakhouse in Vegas.  I would recommend making reservations a couple days in advance especially for peak dining times.  If you have a total rewards card they do accept it here.  The ambiance is classy without being pretentious and boasts an intimate/romantic vibe.  We arrived early and enjoyed a few glasses of wine from the bar in the waiting area.  Our server was Mario and I can't say enough good things about him but, he is definitely the best server I have had anywhere in the past 6 months.  For me the portion size of the filet with a few sides was enough for my friend and I to split, especially after the popovers they bring to the table.  They have an extensive wine list with a selection for every dish.  Popovers:  Served with butter and sea salt.  Be careful these are dangerously good and you will fill up fast.  This time they gave us a little recipe card with them so I will definitely try to recreate them at home.  Duck Liver Pate:  This came out compliments of the chef.  I am normally not a fan since it's usually so gamy but, it wasn't here.  It was smooth, creamy and mild in flavor.   Ceaser Salad:  The salad was good but, I felt the dressing lacked the bold and robust flavor that it had on previous visits.  Filet: Juicy, flavorful, tender and cooked to the exact temperature we requested.  The pad of butter on top really gives it that something extra and I always order the blue cheese sauce on the side because it's a must have.  Veal Chop:  I am not a fan of veal however, I took the opportunity to take a bite of my friends.  It was a perfect medium, juicy and very lean.  If I wasn't such a steak fan I would probably order this next time.  Sides:  Mashed Potatoes: So creamy and bordering on the edge of runny but, flavorful. Stuffed Mushroom Caps: Hearty flavored filling and the mushroom caps were done without being mushy.  Hen of the Woods Mushrooms: A perfect accompaniment to the flavor of the steak and a large portion size.   Dessert: We chose the almond joy dessert off of the daily specials list and we were not disappointed with the artistry, creativity or flavors.  Mario also brought out a small brownie bite for all of us and even though I liked the almond joy better they were moist and well executed.  You can go elsewhere and pay a lot more for lackluster service and overpriced steaks on the strip that don't taste as good as this place but, I prefer consistency in every way.",

When I walked to the bathroom there was a pile of dirty plates on a tray in the aisle way. And that tray was still there when I came back from the bathroom with no one in site. Didn't feel like a $280 dinner for 2 people. Seemed too casual and service not up to par for the prices honestly. Glad we tried it but wouldn't go back because there are just so many great steakhouse options in Vegas.",

I personally cannot justify it. I did have an excellent baked potato - thank you Yelpers for that recommendation. It was beautifully presented, beautiful setting, extremely professional service. 4 stars for all that. I'll stick with my $12 buffet thank you (see my other review).",

The manager, Warren, was super friendly and it's obvious that he cares about his guest's experience!  My friend is a big fan of Hell's Kitchen and said the winner works as a chef here as a prize from the show. She was working tonight, taking pictures with fans and talking to them. It seemed like a cool experience for fans of the show.   I ordered the filet mignon and added lobster for $20. I wasn't a big fan of the lobster but the steak was great! For sides we ordered Mac & cheese, stuffed mushrooms and a loaded baked potato. The stuffed mushrooms were delicious! I almost didn't order them but I'm so glad I did! My favorite was the French Onion Soup, which was a special for the night. I'm a big fan of French onion soup and I have to say, this was the best I've ever had!  We were so full that we didn't order dessert but we were given brownie bites at the end of our meal. It was the perfect size!",

The whole experience was really excellent. From the friendly hostess, waitress, circulators and even the management- we were well cared for and just had super service.   Ok, food!  We had the French onion soup, wonderful and cheesy. I ordered the 6oz Waygu Beef Filet Mignon, and it was quite possibly the best steak I've ever had. The extra money for the Waygu was worth every penny. I had the green beans as a side and they were delish. My companion had the monkfish wrapped in bacon with broccolini and bow tie pasta, which was also very good.  We were very happy with our portion sizes.  Now, the popovers! What a fabulous bread service to offer. They were out of this world. As a bread baker I was tickled. Popovers have been my only failure. BLTSteak provides the recipe and I cannot wait to give it another shot.   Hard decision, but we passed on dessert. I'll absolutely visit another BLTSteak or BLTPrime in the future.",

We returned to this restaurant after 2017 dinner which we really enjoyed our chateaubriand for two Delicious, savory & tender steak served to us. During that dinner, the chef even came to the our table & served her delicious recent invention of her dessert which we were so delighted.  So we returned in march 2019.We ordered the same thing.. The steak was rubbery, too fatty, so greasy, and it had butter on top which made it too greasy.We were famished prior to dining, but because of the meat texture & grease, we ate just 4th of it..so disappointed..The asst mgr came to our table & apologized. He gave us his biz card & offerred us comp for 2 next visit.. However, my friend, in the middle of the night started to have gastro issue. She kept going to the bathroom the whole day. She was burping the dinner she ate at BLT..I, on the other hand,   was also having issue with the greasy meat.. i decided to go to lunch at p.f. chang for wonton soup to get the greasy taste out of my tastebud...So that was really a bad returned experience at BLT..well, next time i will use the comp & order sirloin or something else.BLTis a very costly steakhouse...",

They first serve you bread with pate, then their popovers which was nice and fluffy in the inside, but I tried not to eat so much to save room for our oysters and medium rare bone-in rib eye.   My hubby and I have recently got into eating oysters and we decided to order a dozen. Six from the west coast and 6 from the east coast? I don't know much about oysters but our waiter was helpful to educate me on the difference. One was small, salty and a little sweet and the other type was bigger and more briney. O.m.g. We have tried oysters at a buffet once and our local taco shop, BUT these were such a treat! It was SO good and actually see the difference between the ones we have tried before. The day after we tried Paris Restaurant's oysters and the oysters were small and cost $10 more at Paris. BLT was def much better.   Bone-in ribeye: after reading reviews, I agree that it was a little too charred bc at one point I did spit out. Other than that, we requested medium rare and they cooked it perfectly. The meat was big, flavorful, and juicy (thatswhatshesaid). I saved it and ate it for lunch today and it was still good haha. The steak also comes with a side of bone marrow.   We raved about this place to our friends that we all agreed to eat here next time we come back.",

It's ayce lobster, crabs, caviar, and other goodies!! We made reservations in advance, and Jamie (hostess) was sooo nice and sweet Since we were a large party, she put us in a private room. The service at BLT is excellent!! So this place is not your typical buffet, they are all about quality not quantity. They have ayce lobster tails, king crab legs, stone crab legs, fresh-shucked oysters, prime rib, rack of lamb, filet mignon, sushi, omelette bar, and so on. They also have a separate menu you can order from (that's where the unlimited American Sturgeon Caviar is), which is still part of the brunch. Unlimited pours of Perrier-Jouet Champagne, mimosas, and bloody mary's!! Oh and my fave Gruyere cheese-flavored popovers from BLT Steakhouse!! I would sooo recommend this place, it is pricey but so worth every penny. If you have a \"total rewards\" card you get $5.00 each person. Next time your in Vegas check them out!!!",

    "text": "This was my first experience at a moderately-priced steakhouse. Expensive is not necessarily better. Fancier indeed though.    The GOOD: The complimentary appetizers were good, toasted bread crisps with liver spread and their special bread popovers. The service and ambiance was wonderful. Romantically lit and not too loud. My cup was never empty that night and I drank a lot too. Staff were attentive.    The BAD: Each bite of my bone-in ribeye steak took me to salt city. Even the spare ribs were on the salty side. The steak was coarse as well, hard to chew. It wasn't dry but coarse/rubbery. Truffle mash potatoes was good but almost headed to salt city too. I was gagging by the end of my meal. When the manager came by to ask if the temperature of my steak was good, I said it was ok. but I also wanted to blow up and say wth I paid so much for this salty piece of steak. Idk if it was due to the butter on top or what but it was salty af. The bone marrow that came with it was good.   2 stars for the good service and ambiance. I can eat a lot of almost anything, so I was surprised this expensive meal literally had me gagging. I prefer to endure shitty service with awesome food over shitty food with awesome service, cuz I go to restaurants for the food.",

First, we were not offered beverages for about 5 minutes after we were seated. Then when we finally ordered, cut took 10 minutes for just the popovers, and an additional 30 minutes to be served our meal. There was no warning by our waitress that the wait would be so long. Our waitress also went as far to refer to us as \"the regular\" customers when we asked about the party who had a separate menu posted on the wall. She explained that menu was for a \"big shots\" party for chef Ariel. We did not feel like valued customers, we basically took a back seat to the important people. When we finally got our dinner, it was good but not amazing. We had a previous amazing experience at Steak the year before and were expecting the same. We will not be returning the BLT Streak.",

    "text": "Wanted to do something nice with Boyfriend for my birthday dinner, so we decided we would try our very first official fancy pants American Steakhouse.  We were staying at Flamingo and didn't want to travel far, so this worked.  We called in the morning, they mentioned they were pretty open, but made reservations for 8pm anyway.    The decor was more modern than I thought it would be, and brighter than I thought.  And the tables were slightly close together--we could perfectly hear our neighbor's conversations, and noticed every time they stared our direction.  A little more privacy would've been nice.  We eventually were also neighbored next to a boisterous bachelor party, but, whatever, it's Vegas.    After trying to get some insider info from our server, Leon, (see below) we decided on starting with raw oysters and we each ordered the 22oz bone in ribeye with a side each of Mac and cheese and truffle mashed potatoes.  We also ordered a dirty martini and a glass of Riesling. We were pleasantly surprised at the beautiful popovers we had and the amuse bouche  (a lovely, light duck pate with croutons) was so so good.  All the food was tasty, and cooked to perfection.  I ordered my steak 'black and blue' and it was exactly that.  The herbed butter on top was heavenly, and I would've loved more of it.  The steak itself was tender, with good flavor, nice marbling, thick cut, lovely crust... And the truffle mash was the highlight of our night.    For dessert we ordered the strawberry rhubarb cheesecake, and they stuck a candle in it for my birthday.  They also brought out two bonus brownie bits, that were standard. Boyfriend loved the cheesecake.   Our server, Leon, was perfectly nice and tried his best to be accommodating.  A couple of things-- we had mentioned this was our first steakhouse and asked some questions about the meat and he gave me a recommendation based on my tastes.  I also asked about the sides, and such...He gave me text-book information about the items, but honestly I just wanted a \"go with [this item], it's seriously the bomb\" or \"you really don't want to miss out on this\".  I left feeling I should've tried other things instead of what I ordered.  He went above and beyond when he brought me a taste of the wine I was thinking of ordering (and thank goodness he did, I hated the wine) and asked the kitchen if they could allow us to order just half a dozen of raw little neck clams (they were running low so the kitchen said no, we'd have to order the whole seafood tower) and thanked us for coming in.  But service all in all was very very slow.  Lulls in the meal were long and plentiful.  The whole meal was pushing 2 hours, and it was definitely mostly waiting time.    On the whole, the place is good, the food is worth a visit, but I'm not sure I'd come back.  Having to spend that much on a meal ($250 tax and tip included), I expected at tad bit more, but was a little disappointed.",

Meat of that quality doesn't need a lot of flavour/butter/garnish added to it IMO. The reason for 3 stars is because I believe this place is seriously over priced for what you get. I had a much better experience at the other Ramsey steak house in the Paris. 2 appys, 1 drink, 2 steaks  (no sides) was over $200.00.",

I had a craving for some oysters so after the waiter recommendation I ordered the seafood platter for 2 and expected nice big plump oysters, shrimp, king crab, and lobster but instead got the total opposite. For the high price they charge we got small portions where the oysters were the size of a half dollar with barely any meat and the so called jumbo shrimp was medium size that was literally the same size as the lobster and the king crab leg was so skinny it looked like it was from somebodies leftovers (See photos). The popover bread that came out was huge which gave me the  impression that the entree and sides will be the same. I ordered the veal chop, while the wife had the main lobster, the kids shared the braised short ribs and our friend had a steak. The waiter told us that the sides were big enough to share so we ordered mash potatoes, asparagus and wild mushrooms. When the food came out the veal chop and braised rib looked and tasted good but the lobster again was tiny along with the sides. The portion of the mash potato was a joke - 2 spoons and it was gone; how can that be enough for even one person let alone sharing.  Same for the asparagus and mushrooms. Spending over $400 plus tip we left feeling unfulfilled and hungry.",

Our water glass was always full, the food was spot on, and the hostess got us in earlier than our reservation! If you want amazing food try the filet mignon.

We didn't see our waiter, Juan, but on rare occasions. No butter served with what they call lobster. Bottom line is, The prices are obscene for the service and the food.

Also had stuffed mushroom side which was tremendous. Banana cream pie for dessert very good. Only thing I didn't care for is what so many other reviews rave about- the bone marrow. Actually I'm being polite (was gross) but hey personal taste I guess. Decor was nothing special. And venue (the old and tired Ballys casino) is not worthy of a high quality restaurant like this.

    "text": "What a wonderful new addition to Las Vegas. We had dinner  on July 25, 2014.  And nobody in our party was disappointed. From start to finish, everything was amazing! We ordered a few of the specialty drinks that started our dinner experience off on the right path. It continued with the Chef's complimentary appetizers, and we had the artichoke and beet salad too. I can't pick a favorite since they all were great!  Maybe put the duck pate on the menu?   Two different steaks ordered, The bone in rib eye, and strip steak. The strip steak did come out medium instead of medium rare, but was too good to send back.  The rib eye was melt in your mouth tender. The lobster was also ordered and I was told was delicious as all that was left was its sad empty shell. Also enjoyed was the asparagus, Hen of the woods mushrooms and a perfect baked potato.  Did I mention the peanut butter mousse? WOW....  We were lucky to meet and talk with  the  Executive Chef and give him and his staff our compliments. Great Job!!  I will be back",

We shared the Bone In Rib-eye which took almost 45 minutes to be served, and it was undercooked.  Although it was very flavorful, it was not a good cut of meat.  I am not sure if I have ever seen a tendon in the middle of a rib-eye, but this one had a large one running through it.  It was overall a fatty piece of steak.  The Bone In at Joe's is far superior for the same price.  The service was slow even though there were many servers present.  Did I mention the popovers were amazing?  Probably would  not go back.",

I can never pass up ordering Chilean Sea Bass, if it's on the menu, and it was. It didn't disappoint, although I may order that steak next time!  The sides, although they say are enough for 1 person, were plenty for us to share.  They also serve popovers, a bread with melted cheese on top, that were sooo good.  I ate until I could eat no more.  After we told the waiter we were too full for dessert, he brought out MORE complimentary items.  Brownie bites and cake pops.  I was so impressed by this restaurant, I can't wait to go back!",

My only criticism with this place is where our table was located. Despite our reservation,  we were seated what appeared to be outside the main seating area, next to a bar.   So, slight disappointment in the ambiance department,  but not enough for me to knock it down a star.  The food more than made up for it!",

    "text": "I have never been so disappointed by what used to be our go to steakhouse in Las Vegas.  I decided I wanted to go back to BLT for my birthday dinner this past Tuesday; we have been to BLT three times this past year alone.  I don't know if the recent CET bankruptcy has anything to do with it, but the service and food have taken a huge downturn.  The service was poor - we were left sitting for extended periods of time with absolutely zero attention from anyone.  This was unusual as in all of our past visits, the waiters and bussers were all over the tables and made you feel very special.  As CET Diamond, we received the complimentary appetizers, which have definitely been downsized since this past May.  My special birthday dinner was the Maine Lobster entree - WOW - can't believe they called that an entree.  The shells were huge, but the lobster meat was MAYBE the size of 2 crawfish.  My husband's short ribs (his go to at BLT) were also downsized and extremely fatty.  The side dishes were a joke; $11 for green beans (which was a personal portion), his mashed potatoes were served in a ramiken (about 3/4 cup) for $11!    I gave the extra star for the popovers - which remained as they were.  Well BLT, you ruined it for me!  At least I know this steakhouse will no longer be in the mix of restaurants to chose from!",

Got our rib eye and the steak was RARE, bleeding rare. We took a few bites and wanted to leave. We had places to go to and plans we already set out to do. Got the check and we got charged for the Porterhouse steak (115) which we didn't eat because it was BURNT. At this point, we were too tired to complain because honestly... they didn't even care. So we paid and left.  Save your money and go somewhere else.",

I have never experienced such fabulous flavors all coming together to create the perfect short rib.  My husband had the filet mignon and said it was the best he has ever had!! Everything is a la cart so we also added the whipped mashed potatoes. And your meal will come with a homemade pop overs. (Included in your meal). They are just like your remember having from your mother if you've had popovers before.......Soft- buttery and big! They bring you a jar of sea salt to top it off with. interesting taste to an already fabulous pop over!!!  My short rib was $42 his filet mignon was $62 and the potatoes were another $12. More or less.... we also shared banana ice cream for dessert and it was $10! Everything was absolutely fabulous I can hardly wait to go back to Vegas and indulge in what I consider to be the best steakhouse in Vegas.... even though I was full after the meal I suggested we go back and eat there on our last day in Vegas. That's how good it was.!!! This restaurant is located inside of Bally's towards the back where it connects to Paris with the shops!  Reservations highly recommended and dress is Business casual. The wait staff service -was impeccable. Eager to please.  (The only thing that would make this restaurant any better was if it was sitting on the strip!!! ( no views ) )  Enjoying a-quiet relaxing evening having one of the best steaks you'll ever have. !!!!!!!!!! ENJOY!  You'll have to check to see if they validate parking if you're coming from outside at Bally's... when you make your reservation.",

    "text": "Saw an advertisement of a delicious looking steak on an electronic bill board on the Las Vegas strip, and some of the pictures on yelp looked good, so we decided to give it a try.  I'm sad to report that we were so disappointed in this \"steak\" house.  We ordered the the Cowboy steak which was a 22 oz dry aged, bone-in ribeye with bone marrow. We also ordered a number of appetizers and a few sides.   The reason this review is getting two stars is because of the appetizers and sides, they were the highlight of the meal, and they shouldn't have been, especially since this is considered a steak house. We ordered the Tuna Tartare  , which came with avocado and a soy-lime dressing and served with house made waffle chips, it was good, not great, but good. The tuna tasted fresh and was not fishy at all. We ordered the Burrata which was soft flavorful and creamy, absolutely delicious. It came with toybox tomatoes and a basil seed vinaigrette, so tasty. We also had the Roasted beet salad, that contained beets, endive, gorgonzola, and candied walnuts, which was also satisfying. As sides for our steak we ordered truffle mash potatoes and sauteed green beans, which were both super tasty. The truffle mash potatoes were creamy and well seasoned, while the sauteed green beans were crispy, yet soft and properly seasoned. Almost forgot, they also served us some complimentary freshly made popovers which were warm, soft and airy, absolutely delicious!  But now to the steak. The steak was absolutely huge and we ordered it medium rare. The steak was brought to us as ordered, but I don't know how they managed to bring it out medium rare and still char (burn) the outside. The char was not a tasty char, it tasted more like eating a piece of charcoal! Absolutely disgusting, and a total waste of $$. What was suppose to be the star of the meal, was a complete disappointment. Although the picture I took looks absolutely delicious, it was not! The outside char overwhelmed  the flavor of the meat or any seasoning it had. Again, it was like eating blackened, burnt charcoal. Overall, if you're looking for great steak, I suggest you look elsewhere, where your money will be better spent.",

This is not the typical Vegas buffet with a bunch if options but it was just one line with all high quality items.  Lobster, crab legs, prime rib, lamb chops, prawns, just to name some.  The desserts were great too.  The service was steak house quality",

Anyways, evening dinner reservations here were a breeze. It was however, for a Sunday evening in which many guest have already left the hotel for their visit. The restaurant is very dim. The services was great, everyone greeted us and made sure that we were satisfied with our meals. We had the Beef Tartare. It was delicious, fresh, and soft. I wanted to order another one!! Sides were delicious, we had the green beans and mushrooms. The steak was one of the BEST steaks I've ever had! it is pricey, over $100 for the cut, but it was perfectly prepared, awesome char crisp sear, fatty tender center. The fish was very tasty, however I would have been happier if it was grilled whole. The banana cream dessert was the best banana cream I had ever tried, that I ordered an extra to store in our hotel fridge for the plane ride home the next day hehehe. I will certainly continue coming back, especially since we must hold The Diamond status!",

Each bite just melts in your mouth. The meal started off with some delicious meats and cheeses and then out came the popovers. OMG! Save room for these. I could've had just those for my meal. Dessert was a disappointment when compared to dinner. Had the banana cream pie and in this case--bigger was not better. There were huge chunks of banana (like 1/3rd) that were unexpected and really the only banana flavor. I'd come back here for a meal in a heartbeat and just skip dessert.",

I can't recall the last time I wanted every bit of an early course.  For the main course, we shared an insanely good 12 ounce Wagyu ribeye. When. you eat the fat and it dissolves into the best gravy you've ever had, then you know it was $92 well-spent. The stuffed mushroom caps were excellent, but the hen-of-the-woods mushrooms were the perfect pairing with a perfect cut of meat.   The onion rings were disappointingly doughy and under seasoned.

Popovers were badly cooked, Porterhouse steak ($115 for two people) was fatty and barely edible, truffled mashed potatoes ($16) arrived in a small bowl looking unappetizingly gray in color. $240 for two people.

    "text": "ALL YOU CAN EAT LOBSTER - THE BEST BUFFET IN LAS VEGAS Trick me once, shame on you. Trick me twice, and I deserve what I got. The gold standard of any great buffet is lobster. I've been tricked and straight out lied to many times when calling buffets and asking if they had lobster. I've had friends tell me that certain buffets have all you can eat lobster, only to be disappointed to find a huge upcharge.  There are many buffets in Las Vegas, and I've tried them all. Before continuing, I have to tell you that the best buffet in Las Vegas is very expensive. This buffet is one of the highest priced on the strip. In this case, it is beyond worth the extra money. This buffet has a $99 price tag, but before that price scares you off, this buffet has everything you would expect at a five-star restaurant, only in buffet form.  This fantastic buffet includes lobster tails, Alaskan king crab legs, lamb, prime rib, sushi, fresh-shucked oysters, truffle mashed potatoes, banana bread pudding French toast, a custom omelet station, lobster bisque, eggs Benedict, never-ending glasses of Perrier-Jouet Champagne & mimosas. Oh yeah, did I mention ALL YOU CAN EAT LOBSTER TAILS?  When I first tried this buffet, I immediately put three large lobster tails on my plate with three cups of hot butter. It was a magical experience. I was eating these lobster tails like chicken fingers. I then walked back up and put three more lobster tails on my plate. It was glorious.  The Sterling Brunch at Bally's is the once a week buffet that is the Slob Blog best buffet in Las Vegas. It's only available on Sundays starting at 9:30 AM. $99 is a hefty price tag, but this will be one of the best food experiences you will have in your life. Congratulations to the Sterling Brunch at Bally's on being the Slob Blog best buffet in Las Vegas.  PRO SLOB TIPS 1. Stay away from the salad bar and carbs if possible. The lobster, prime rib, and lamb are so good that you should treat this experience like a Brazilian steakhouse. Meat, meat, and more meat.  2. This buffet will probably require a trip to the bathroom. Since the closest bathroom is about thirty yards away in the casino, come ready. Bring wet wipes both for your cleaning and to thoroughly clean the toilet seat. These bathrooms are gross. Be prepared. Clean the seat thoroughly, take care of business, and then return to the buffet for round two.  3. Fast the night before. Come in with an appetite. Plan on this being your only meal of the day. I went to this buffet with a friend who had the same mindset. We were barely able to walk back to the hotel room after this feast.  4. Plan on taking a nap and most likely not leaving your room the day of this feeding. If you do this buffet right, you will be laid up for at least twenty-four hours. Plan accordingly.  5. If you're an A-hole, who will keep talking about the price, don't go. The Sterling Brunch buffet is an experience. If you're a person, who thinks that the $100 price tag means that you should be treated like King Robert Baratheon from Game of Thrones, stay home. Have another spam sandwich and leave this experience to those that will appreciate it. You're in Las Vegas. One hundred dollars goes in less than a minute. You will spend the best hundred dollars during your Las Vegas trip eating this astonishing meal.",

There was a brief wait before we were seated at our table which gave us some time to take some photos for memories.   My parents and I were sat in the dining area in a nice booth that faced the bar. Our waiter was very personable and went over the menu so we can better make our decision as well as let us know the specials.  We ordered : Chopped salad (4/5) Shrimp Cocktail (5/5) Dry aged wagyu filet mignon (3/5) Scottish salmon (5/5) Mashed potatoes (5/5) Green beans (3/5)  We also had some red wine and Heineken to quench our thirst. The good was great I wish the sides were a little bigger portions. They did bring out some appetizers for us prior to the pop overs. There was some pate with a jelly on top, some other toast with bacon, samples of salami, chorizo, and prosciutto that was great to pair with the wine. We also had a small plate of petite fours for dessert. I was hoping we may get a free slice of cake or dessert for my parents celebration but nothing was offered.   I'd like to come back and try their Sterling Brunch some time.",

The host was very friendly, sat us, and told us we had the best waitress on the BLT staff.   Service was amazing, from the waitress to the bus team to the servers.   The bread pop overs the table received prior to our order were wonderful and so tasty I'd recommend this place just so you can experience them.   My wife ordered the wedge salad and I had had the butternut squash soup. The wedge salad was perfect, served on a cold place as a salad should be. My soup looked good but tasted a bit sweeter than I prefer. I didn't say a word about it as it wasn't a bad soup, it was done they way he chef intended for it to be done but it wasn't they type I cared for. The service team saw I didn't eat any and asked if all was ok and I said I didn't care for it so they removed it from the bill. (Very thoughtful to proactively ask and take action when a patron isn't even making an issue)  We were a party of 4 and had salmon, filet, and ribeyes for dinner. Our food was properly cooked and tasted amazing. The table consensus was that the bone in ribeye was the best but once again all our entres were wonderful.   For dessert we ordered ice cream, apple cobbler and the table was also given brownie and candy pops. All of which were the perfect way to end our best dinner of a 5 day stay in Vegas.  Based on this experience (12/30) I have already booked another visit for Valentine's Day!  See you soon BLT!",

For starters, the place is in dire need of a facelift or some sprucing up. The service was so slow that after we had our entrees we didn't see our server for almost an hour! I had to flag down another server to find her. I think they need a dress code, because the clientele was rough for the most part. A lot of flip flop wearing, tank top sporting overly served people without basic dining manners. For these prices, you want a fine dining experience, or you would hit the buffet for dinner instead. I will say, the popovers were delicious, and the filet was cooked perfectly. If the service and ambiance had been even a smidge better, I would have gone back. We will not be back.",

Everyone was super friendly, informative and greeted us with smiles.   Our waiter, Duff, was an absolute pro. He knew that menu inside and out. He was able to give us great recommendations on the wine list and food menu. He made everything sound so delicious that we wanted to order the whole menu! Just a phenomenal job.   Now for the food... They started us off with a little amuse Bouche. It was duck liver mousse with jelly. I don't like liver at all but I gave it a try and wow it was good. My favorite thing was the popovers they brought instead of your typical loaf of bread. The flavor and texture were great and they even give you a card with the recipe! Sharing is caring!   My fiance got the Caesar salad which was great. He got the NY strip steak which was huge and I got my go to Filet Mignon. The steak was good but not the best I've had. Good flavor but it was only warm not piping hot even though it was served on a cast iron plate. I ordered it medium rare and it was perfectly cooked. It paired nicely with their plump asparagus and delicious Mac & cheese. I guess I was a little disappointed in the steak, but everything else was great. Perhaps I'm a steak snob but when you've had some delicious steak you're always chasing the next best thing.",

Wasn't sure about this place at first it is in the same spot as the old Sterling Steakhouse at Ballys. Love the new updated decor. Right away when we sat down we were offered charcuterie platter, foie gras with jam and toast & cheese bread  with garlic and truffle on the house for 7 star members.  Then the popovers with greyer cheese toasted on top was so yummy!!! We ordered lobster & avocado salad, blue cheese wedge , 2 bone in ribeyes medium rare seared to perfection it came with bone marrow & roasted garlic, well done onion rings, steak tartar!  Second visit we ordered the same with added roasted beet, apple & goat cheese salad, chicken & dumpling soup and dessert you must try banana creme pie & also their passion fruit creme brulee is to die for!  On our second visit the  steaks came out cold so the manager in charge apologized made us all new sides & 2 cooked to perfection medium rare bone in ribeye! Definitely recommend this place can't wait to try their Sunday brunch !!",

Translation: we never would have found it on our own. We found out about it through Travelzoo. I would recommend the filet mignon, the popovers, the tuna tartare, brussel sprouts, and souffle. Margot and Willie provided outstanding service! We went over our voucher a bit, but we literally had breakfast for two with the leftovers. My 22oz ribeye was waaaay more than I needed. Come here for great food and service, but be careful not to overdose on the popovers. I filled up quickly, even though I only had a few bites of my popover.  Last tip: come early and enjoy half price appetizers at the bar! It won't count towards your voucher, most likely, but it's a great way to get the party started.",

    "text": "In a word: incredible. I wasn't expecting much from this steakhouse, tucked away in Bally's without a celebrity chef or known brand. But they really, really deliver. Cozy atmosphere, excellently executed menu, top-notch service.  POPOVERS: A fun version of the usual free bread service, these are delightfully airy with a crisp exterior. They're served with fresh Vermont butter and salt, and you even receive a small card with the recipe. I'll just come back instead of trying to make these myself. DUCK LIVER PATE: A complimentary dish served to every table, this was served in a small jam jar with two small slices of bread. I like how the richness of the pate was balanced with the sweet jelly on top. An indulgent start to the meal that raised my expectations for the kitchen.  STEAK TARTARE: It's not the best version I've had on the Strip, but it is delicious! A traditional preparation, plated with nicely crisp country bread, this is a great starter if you don't mind a  steak app before a steak dinner. BURRATA: A heap of deliciously creamy yet mild mozzarella, surrounded with toy box tomatoes and accented with basil seed vinaigrette and basil leaves. Save your popovers to devour this. Add a touch of the salt from the butter, too. ROASTED BEETS: Everyone has this on their menu these days, but BLT's comes as a salad with apple, french green beans, gorgonzola, and walnuts. BF called this the best version he's had. BONE-IN RIB EYE: This was heaven. Cooked and served in cast-iron, it has a thick crust and was cooked perfectly to medium-rare. The fatty bites right next to the bone are the best part, and this is served with the marrow, a tempura-fried onion ring, and a whole roasted garlic bulb. Easily one of the best steaks I've had, and at a shareable 22oz and a wallet-friendly price. After taking the first bite, BF and I knew we would be coming back. GRILLED LOBSTER: This is a $20 supplemental, and well worth it. Generous portion, served atop the steak, sweet and tender. I'm usually not much of a lobster fan, but I'm glad we decided to add this on. TRUFFLE MASHED POTATOES: Despite all the rave reviews, this didn't go over so well with us. We like truffle-accented dishes, and we like potatoes, but something about this dish just didn't work. Good, smooth texture but it's the only thing on the table we didn't finish. MANCHEGO WHITE GRITS: Wow. After leaving the south, it's been difficult to find great grits. Well, here they are, perfectly accented with a tasty green chile relish. I couldn't have asked for better. BROWNIE BITES: We were too full to order an actual dessert, but were presented with this complimentary plate, and it's perfectly sized for just a hint of sweetness after the meal.   I feel like I can't fully express what a great find this is- apparently others are catching on, because the dining room was packed on a casual Wednesday evening. I recommend making a reservation if you plan to drop in during dinner hours.   Snag a Groupon while they're still up ($100 credit for $70), the discount is appealing but totally unnecessary to make me return- the food alone is enough to make this a strong and frequent recommendation when seeking a nice steak dinner on the Strip.",

Could have gotten a better steak at a Husky Oil truck stop for far less. Excellent service was the only thing that saved the otherwise well earned and generous tip.

    "text": "More like 2.5 stars.  Very expensive, even with a groupon that I got for 55.00( used a 20% off promo code) for 100.00 worth of food.    My disclaimer is that I don't eat beef, however everyone else in my party does.  They did let us use 2 groupons( 1 per couple) so that was nice.   My wife and female cousin both ordered filet, medium well.  They enjoyed that a lot.  Both said the steak was perfectly cooked and tender.  Male cousin got a NY strip and he also enjoyed that. In my opinion,  For the price of the steak, they should give you the sauce, not charge an extra 2.00( nickel and dime the customer).  The side dishes were advertised by the server as \" family style\".  Wrong, they are single serving size and pricey at 10.00 each.  My wife and I shared a baked potato, mac n cheese( just ok) and cream spinach.  Cousins had green beans, mashed potatoes( loaded with butter and cream) and baked.     I was NOT a fan of the popovers nor was my wife because we dont like \"eggy\" tastes and those were very eggy tasting.    Speaking of eggs, I got the lobster cobb salad( 23.00).  The hard boiled egg was NOT hard boiled, I can't eat runny yolks and thats what I was served.  I asked for a hard cooked egg and was told they did not have any.  Also asked for croutons and was given stale toasted bread.  The salad had a few chunks of lobster, not that much.I'm not a fan of frisee' or radicchio and the salad was loaded with that.  It was not special and not worth the price.     For desserts we had banana cream pie, that was very good, the best part of the meal.  My cousins had a peanut butter mouse.   It was their 20th anniversary and the restaurant gave them a small amount of champagne, not a free dessert or anything more.   Pretty chintzy.   We skipped the duck pate because we're not fans.     I doubt I'd be back, even with the groupon.  We had to pay an extra 28.00 and then left a 20.00 tip. ( just our portion)",

    "text": "Prior to my last visit to Vegas, I solicited my fellow Seattle Yelpers for dining advice - specifically, where to go for steaks. I was dissuaded from dining at this restaurant, and other places were recommended instead. However, I saw a Groupon deal for BLT and we didn't want to blow our whole budget on one meal during our visit, so I decided to give this place a try.  And we were SO glad we did!  From beginning to end, our experience here was A-1. The service was fabulous, our food was fabulous, the ambiance was lovely, and everything was great. As others have mentioned, the complementary appetizers were incredible: toast rounds with duck pate (I didn't have this but my hubby said it was divine), and we both swooned - SWOONED! - over the large, warm, soft gruyere popovers! OMG, these were the best \"breads\" we had ever had in our lives. We talked about it for days afterwards. (What a nice touch, too, to include the recipe for them! Like, in a million years, I could ever replicate these wonders...but still! Nice thought!).   I had the tuna tartare and a side of asparagus. Both dishes were super. The asparagus' stalks were peeled so they appeared to be albino spears, and they were cooked and seasoned to absolute perfection. Hubby had a ribeye steak and I had a bit of it and omg it melted in my mouth. Medium rare and cooked to perfection and tender and moist and oh so flavorful. One of the best steaks I have ever had. (I forget what sides he had. We were so rapt with the steak).   Too full for dessert but they brought us out some complimentary brownie bites. I had asked for some Earl Grey tea and they brought me out a tea cup and hot water and the \"sides\" of sugars and Splendas, but when the server came with the tea caddy, they didn't have Earl Grey! In fact, the selection of teas was quite limited. I was surprised they brought me all the tea fixin's when they didn't have the specific tea I had ordered. I politely refused any others (I only wanted my Earl Grey). This was the only \"issue\" with the whole meal - and it is a petty one at that.   Even if we hadn't had the Groupon, we gladly would have paid full price for our meal. It was that good. Better than good. It was great!",

    "text": "Dinner at BLT Steakhouse in Bally's was very good. On a scale of 1 - 10 I would give it about an 8.5.  The Service - Top notch service. Everyone was very friendly and very helpful. At no time were we having to wait for something. The hostess was especially nice.  The Environment - Beautiful restaurant, dark and romantic. A little on the noisy side, but nothing that was an issue.  The Appetizers - I had the Spinach Salad which was spectacular and my wife had the Caesar Salad which she said was very good. They also bring you Cheese Popovers that are extraordinary. The popovers even come with a little card that has the recipe. Nice touch. Prior to the popovers, the waiter brought a little taste from the kitchen, which was a duck liver mousse with a jelly topping. The mousse was amazing.  The Entree - I had the Filet, which was cooked perfectly, but the flavoring was nothing to write home about. It was good, but not great. My wife had the Tuna Tartare as her entree and she loved it. She said it was the best she's ever had.  The Drinks - I had a Johnny Walker and Soda and it was STRONG!!!!  We did not have dessert, too full, but the dessert selection was good.  Overall the restaurant was very good. I'm a big steak fan, but I like bolder flavors, so I would probably not order a steak next time we come, but my wife will definitely order the tuna again.",

    "text": "Las Vegas.  Is there anyplace with a higher concentration of first class steakhouses?  Well, yeah, actually there is - Buenos Aires.  But that's so far to go, and why bother when for only about half the price of a ticket to Argentina you can go to BLT Steak?  (Okay, that's a slight exaggeration, but BLT Steak is kind of pricey.)    Looking back over my Yelp reviews, I notice that my five-star ratings tend to go to places that serve a great steak.  I didn't plan it that way.  I guess I just love a great steak.  Well, BLT has them.  My bone in rib eye was fabulous, and my wife loved her filet.  My rib eye came with bone marrow on the side and I ordered a delicious Bearnaise from their selection of sauces to go with it.  Our side of potato skins was more than enough for two, and perfectly prepared.  I started with the Bay Scallops \"Rockefeller\" - a creative idea that was well executed.  My wife started with a wedge salad - a mundane idea that was also well executed.  I think attention to detail matters, and at BLT it was apparent immediately in the complimentary amuse bouche (a pate) and the delicious popovers.  The bread plate is one of those little things that allows a restaurant to distinguish itself, and those popovers were certainly a creative way to do just that.  And they thoughtfully provided us with the recipe on a little card.  The room is warm and inviting, with soft lights and tables well-spaced for quiet conversation.  The bar had a big screen TV, visible from the dining room, which was a bit jarring, but I suppose you just can't get away from the screen these days.  Other than that, the ambiance was very nice.  The service was friendly and attentive.  Our server, Mario, was helpful on our questions and very quick with anything we requested.  One quibble - the drinks were a bit overpriced and not overly generous.  But, c'est la vie.  This is not a place to go if you're pinching pennies anyway.  Oh yeah, and by the way, sorry New York and Chicago but no - you don't have a higher concentration of great steakhouses.  I know you think you do but, as they say, \"Vegas, baby!\"",

We were  sat way in the back near the kitchen. Mmmm ok.  My teenage son had the new york strip with fries. I had the crab cake  and creamed spinach since iam not a steak eater or pork chop. The steak was supposed to be well done... know i know but anyway it was very pink on the first cut. Outside was storched/burnt and crisp.I thought maybe another cut into it.. perhaps better.. nope. I mean its toasted black here. Took 8 mins to get someones attention. She tells us that its chargrilled like that...burnt...ok. she finds our waiter. He comes and inspects it. Tells us he can put it back on the grill. Goes back. Comes back burnt more to a crisp. We are good on eating  because im thinking u put my food back on the grill with others food. Although heat disinfects but mmm no.creamed spinch had no seasoning. Very runny. Crab cake was ok but is expected since its a steak house and not seafood. Waiter was friendly. 100 plus lighter and was still hunger when we left.",

This is a steal, basically 50% cost, for $420 worth of food/drinks.  We had four of us and had a hard time spending $420, without buying a bottle of wine.  It is enough for drinks, apps, salads, dinners, desserts for everyone (two of us did share a porterhouse).  All in all, the food was solid.  Nothing was super amazing or life changing, but everything was as expected for a steakhouse at that price point.  I did not leave disappointed.  I am not sure I would have paid full price for the meal, as I think there could be better meals for less cost, but with the deal it was great.  The popovers are famous and for good reason.  I could get full off of those alone.  I would probably give 3 stars for the porterhouse, as it was actually a little cold when we got it (like it had been sitting), even though it was on a \"hot plate\".  Everything else I would give a solid 4 stars.",

I'll say this...there can be no pop without an over...a breathtakingly sinful concoction of a combination of bread & cheeses!  For most, this would be the grand finally...alas, BLT performed an E-Street band worthy encore of whipped butter and a tin full to the bone of salty excellence (salt).  Once this triad of flavors hit the taste buds a rather unique biological reaction happens in the form of a slight moan & your eyes gravitating towards the back of your head in what can only be described as pure ecstasy... Once you regain consciousness you are elated to find out the experience has just begun for there is still the main course yet to come.  What awaits behind door number two is what the gods call heaven on earth, if you consider your heaven a perfectly cooked bone-in strip with a char so immaculate I'd slap my mamma if I weren't certain she'd retaliate guns blazin....  I was able to tackle the beast with my sharp cunning as an individual...along with my trusty cattle prod, Betsy, should the event turn sour.... I would be remissed to conclude this trip down the rabbit hole without mentioning the cornucopia of titans charged with creating this immaculate experience.  The GM Laurence Silva , backed by the experience of Warren and Tammy.  A team so warm and inviting it could only be described as a sanctuary of a weary traveler in search of culinary existentialism.  Their dedication to delivering truly great service is matched only be their ability to make you feel at home with their warmth and generosity.  Kudos to Mr. Silva and his management team.  They are gods/goddesses among ants in their craft and touted as such across the industry.",

Steak needed absolutely no steak sauce whatsoever and the sides were equally delicious! They also offered complimentary  bread that everyone said was awesome as well. I only neglected to try the bread because I wanted to save room for the steak I was craving. Overall very great dining experience!",

So we decided to try this restaurant.  We ordered crab cake which was subpar and pricy ($17). For entrees, we ordered filet mignon and ribeye which were perfectly cooked and tasted very good.  You don't need seasoning sauce at all.  The meat was very tender and juicy.  We got stuffed mushroom for side dish and it was ok. Overall, if you are craving for a good quality steak,  go to BLT steak.",

When we get to our table the two high chairs I had asked for when we made the res. weren't even at our table. Imagine how that went with our two toddlers? Not good! Then we spent another 10 min standing there trying to keep the kids busy while they searched for the chairs. The waiter came back with only one saying they didn't have another. I gave him the idea of borrowing one from next door and luckily we got our two highchairs. After that inconvenience, the service and food were terrible. Both the bone-in ribeye and New York steaks were too tough. Had to send back the New York to have it cooked a little longer b/c our medium was too rare. Don't get the \"hen of the mushrooms.\" They were too bland and the way they cooked them didn't make it appetizing at all. Everything was so bad I did not even order my favorite part of the meal, dessert. Never going back.",

We got coupons from tix4tonight for a dinner at BLT on Xmas Eve and never expected such a surprise.  The restaurant is not like the ones where you can enjoy breeze and the sound of a waterfall, but it's so quiet and comfy enough that you can easily lose yourself w/ your lover or your mate, with the dark and candle-lighted environment and the amazingly gorgeously made food. I know \"amazing\" and \"gorgeous\" may not sound as positive as they really mean to a reader of a restaurant review, but that was how the food felt to both our eyes and tongues. Besides the steak, the seafood platter is a must-order! It was so freshly made and beautifully presented.  Simply put, the best steak and complimentary bread at this price range. YOU KNOW WHAT! The manager of the restaurant chopped and served our salads! It was not because the waiters were busy or that was his job. He was such a respectful and humorous gentleman professional to all details and has a humble mind.  BTW, as for parking, Bally's has a huge open air parking lot to its building's east by Flamingo Rd. There's also a garage building which one may not easily find though.",

The popovers were fantastic. The wife ordered the wagyu skirt, and i ordered the bone-in New York (medium rare). Mine came out gray throughout (well done). Sent it back, and refused any further offerings. The sides were \"meh\". The wife's wagyu was pretty decent, but not worth the 60 or so dollars (again compared to Ramsay's place or SW). We were up-sold by our server throughout the entire dining experience, but the over cooked steak completely ruined it for me. I mean seriously, this is your bread and butter, come on. Will not be re-visiting.",

The layout of the restaurant was ok but the service was exceptional, from the moment we arrived the staff made us feel special. Pre appetizer offered by the kitchen was delicious variety of meats, Iberico ham, salami, etc. The Caesars salad was fantastic! Popovers came to the table next, so good I would go again just for the popovers! Then the entree arrived, lobster and filet mignon, so much food, food coma was setting in, waiting for the check the kitchen offered sweet treat to send us on our way, what a fantastic meal! It may cost a little more to eat here but we left feeling like we had a True eating experience, so many great flavors, we couldn't stop talking how much we loved the food and cannot wait to go again! Congratulations to Bally's for opening a great restaurant and thanks to the team at BLT! You deserve a round of applause!",

Had not eaten at  BLT before but we were staying at Paris next door and  decided to try it.  We were seated promptly and our server appeared in a few minutes.  He was very knowledgeable and helpful.  Complementary fois gras was served with crostini. It was very good. They also served popovers which were the highlight of our meal.   We both ordered the Waygu filet mignon, mine medium rare and hers rare.  We also ordered stuffed mushrooms and green beans.  The stuffed mushrooms were good but very heavily salted.  When the steaks arrived, each was not cooked as we ordered.  Hers was medium and mine medium well.  They were topped with an herb mix which was also too heavily salted.  We were going to a show and it had taken quite a long time for the meal to arrive so we did not complain about the salt but did ask my daughter's steak to be redone.  I just ate the one I had ordered.  The service had dropped off after the food came and we didn't get water glasses refilled.  No one came near to ask.  My steak was very dry.  It took some time for the other steak to appear.  Overall, we didn't enjoy the meal here nearly as much as other steak houses we have been to in Vegas.   The chef can't cook Waygu filet as ordered and pretty much destroyed it.  I wouldn't go there again and don't recommend it at all.",

People being serviced out of order. Mistake after mistake. Hasn't this place been open for over a month? I visit a BLT Steak whenever I am in a city that has one. Hands down... The best cooked steak around. The decor of this place is so bad. Miami is the most beautiful of all the restaurants. The lighting, the colors on the walls, the banquettes... Everything seems off. This could have been amazing! Nothing worse than seeing management standing around. It makes me crazy! My two phrases are... You lean, you leave and you have time to lean, you have time to clean. This could be the first BLT Steak to open and close in the same year. So surprised by the whole experience. Ugh!!!",

It started with our waiter Omar who one does not listen to what we have ordered, and two continued to bring us the wrong orders all night, and made us keep the wrong order...  It started off simple we wanted two long islands to drinks and Omar brings us tequila and tells us to just drink them.  My husband ordered the short ribs and Omar says no you need to get lamb y husband said no thank you He just wanted to try the short ribs... Well Omar brought my husband lamb instead of what he ordered. I ordered the capped mushrooms and even asked before hand how it is prepared... Omar stated that they are stuffed with other mushrooms and oven baked with cheese.  when Omar brought the mushrooms to the table the were brunt crisp and unedible... When i asked them why the were so brunt he said that's how they come and took off.  At this point we didn't even want to make a stink that everything was wrong about the whole dinner and experience so we asked for our check, we were just ready to pay and leave it took 30 minutes to recieve a bill... I explained to Omar that we had show tickets and were going to be late and he brushed his hand up saying ya i'll get there and ignored us. I finally called  over a manger to bring us our bill i did not want to ruin our only date night out complianing or be upset so we just got our check paid and went on our way... But since I did'nt get to speak to a manger I hope the owner reads how horrible the service and food was... not happy with this place at all. Too bad yelp doesn't have a zero star... I  had better service at a burger king then this place....",

    "text": "I purchased a Travelzoo voucher for this steakhouse that i thought was a killer deal. Dinner for 2 with drinks for 99 bucks. It Included entrees up to $58, plus an appetizer or salad each and a shared side along with shared dessert. In all honestly, if i hadn't paid with the voucher and instead ponied up full price for this meal i would have been pissed. First off, when i go to a steakhouse that charges nearly 60 dollars for their top cuts, then it had BETTER be sublime. This one was not. I had the supposed 28 day dry aged bone in ribeye. It was too fatty, too bland, and NOT worth the 60 dollar price tag. Are you kidding me? Anyone here that tells you that simply has no idea what they are taking about. And they certainly don't know a great steak when they taste one. Geesh. I have eaten at some of the best steakhouses in town, and this place (at least as far as the steak) falls way short. I will say this: The service was good, and so was the ambiance. But i cannot recommend this place because the showcase item (the steak), was simply just average. Here are some of the other places in town that i have eaten at. Jean George's (Aria), Strip Steak (Mandalay bay), Del Frisco's Double Eagle, Golden Steer, Chop (Red Rock), Vic and Anthony's (Golden Nugget). Each of them topped BLT as far as steak goes.",

Made them take most of them off bill and of course they recommend a bottle of wine to another part of my party that just happens to be $125 for bottle??? I asked party members if they knew and they had no idea cost? Waiter than goes on to recommend their $90 a piece steaks to guests keep in mind waiters tip is guaranteed due to size of party!!! Once agIn complained to manager and he was as useless As the waiter!! Will be speaking to ownership over this!! Food was ok at best \"famous\" popovers were burnt and gross!! Took forever for food and service was awful!!! Avoid at all costs!! Go to Gordon Ramsey steak house or the 9nine in palms or joes steakhouse!! If I could give it 0 stars I would!!! The only reason I didn't walk out with all 23 guests was they were customers of mine who were staying at ballys so I could not ruin their dinner over this but if it was family or friends we would have walked out!!! Do not eat here, oh did I mentioned I had called for reservations and when I got there they had my name down but no party size!!!   Stay away!!!",

I understand a sear but when my steak comes out black, I call that burned. Our waiter was distracted with a table that came in after us that apparently was VIP. This table sent their food back which seemed to overwhelm him due to his eye rolling. He finally came back to us and gave us a lesson on searing in a 1700 degree oven and that's how it's supposed to be. Well, we were not happy and it tasted like charcoal that lasted in our mouths for hours. A manager was offered to us and the same lesson on searing in a 1700 degree oven was provided. I was about to go crazy. She did tell us to make up for it we MIGHT be able to get a cocktail or a dessert to share. The thing is we didn't get either. We waited about 45 minutes for our waiter to stop attending to the VIP table, who seemed just as unhappy, and come back to us. Let's just say by this time I wanted to be Gordon and call someone a \"bloody donkey\"! I will still watch and enjoy Hell's Kitchen and understand why he's looking for a new chef! Love Chef Ramsey still with all my heart but do not recommend this place. Had better food and service at Salt Grass Steak House!",

Really, the only disappointments were the rather slow service and the pretty bad peanut butter and chocolate mousse dessert. The peanut butter-ish flavor was unappealing and the chocolate didn't help much. We left half of it uneaten, and that is almost unheard of for me and a dessert. The wedding soup was something non-traditional and it was very good. The bone in prime rib was good but I'd try something else if I went again. The filet was tender and tasty. The side dishes were good, but small for $11--small enough for the waiter to mention they would only serve one and we should not expect enough to share.",

    "text": "Our meal started with a complimentary duck liver pate with mini toasts, very delicious and a nice touch. Next came the BLT popovers, a kind of bread that I'm told is famous. It was pretty good and was served with butter and sea salt. We ordered the wedge salad. It came with enough of a portion for two and was very good, not the best I've had, in fact, I would say Austin's in Texas station is one of the best wedges in Vegas, but very good nonetheless. I ordered my favorite cut, the one which I judge all steakhouses, the bone-in ribeye, medium rare. This steak was awesome!!! I've been to nearly every steakhouse in Vegas and this one is definitely one of the top I've had. The critic, my wife, ordered the king crab legs. We actually share everything so most of the time she picks what I eat as well. The legs were delicious; sweet, moist, succulent. She was impressed by both the steak and the crab legs. Not so much the popover bread, which is weird because the bread is usually her favorite part. For sides we ordered the fries with cilantro mayonnaise and the potato skins. I know, lots of potato. I alway have leftovers for my daughter and she is obsessed with fries, so, I order them. They were really good though. The potato skins were very good. To end the meal we chose the banana cream pie. This was not what I expected, it was amazing!!! From the crust made with graham and nuts to the fresh bananas inside, both my wife and I were very impressed. And it is large! Enough for us both plus a huge chunk for the kid at home. Our server was Leon, assisted by many, and was very great. This was one of my Groupon meals as well and he was very great about it. (I get so perturbed by the ones who start with an attitude when they find out you're using a Groupon, especially since I always tip on the full amount). In summary, the food was great, the service was great as well, and the prices are to be expected.",

    "text": "This is our second time going to a BLT Steak, and may end up being my last. Don't get me wrong, this place makes a decent meal. But for the prices they charge, I don't see the value.  Our trip to Hawaii a few years ago ended with a above-average dinner at BLT Steak. I found the STEAK was the most disappointing part of the meal, and that our server enhanced our experience with offers and explanations of different sauces to try with our meats.  On our recent trip to Vegas, my girlfriend wanted to go back as she had such great memories from Hawaii. Our dinner was nice, but more of the same. We were seated to a quiet, half-empty restaurant and immediately helped out by our server. I wanted to look over the wine list but found a lot of their wine prices were definitely high. Thus I wanted to wait until i had decided on my meal.  The chef sent out complimentary liver pate with a crostini which was tasty and appreciated. Being just the two of us though, I felt bad not eating much of it as we had made room for steak and only steak.  Then the popovers came out. The popovers are delicious and never disappointing. I enjoy that they even share their recipe with you to take home for the brave few who want to try and repeat such success. We got two monsteorus popovers and shamefully ate 1 3/4 of them.  The meal was nice, though it did not have some of the same options they had in hawaii. We settled for a Filet, a parm-herb crusted veal chop, and a truffle mash. The girlfriend enjoyed the filet very much, suggesting it was better than the last steak we had in Hawaii. But she also craved one of the sauces but couldn't remember which one it was. She asked the server, who brought out a peppercorn sauce. It ended up not being the one she had liked but by that point it didn't matter.  My veal chop was nice, but having my first veal chop, it was not at all that I expected. I take responsibility for that, it just seemed very fatty (not tender meat but fat). The real drawback was the parm-herb crust which was so thick and strong I didn't get much flavor for the veal. I cut and chewed and tore at this thing before I finally gave up. Half the parm-herb crust ended up scraped off.  We both enjoyed the truffle mash, sharing it was the perfect choice. It was whipped to an almost cream-like state which was a little strange but it had such a tremendous flavor.  All in all, we got our $170 check for our two entrees, two glasses of wine, side of taters and a $2 charge for the sauce we didn't like (which caught us off guard). Their menu had two prices for everything, adjusting for those with player cards, i believe. Because of all the numbers and the different colors it was hard to figure out what was what, and for the $200 we ended up dropping on this meal I can assure you I wasn't impressed for the money spent. The girlfriend will likely be back but I think this was in turn my last visit to a BLT Steak for some time.",

    "text": "My fiance and I recently visited BLT Las Vegas, because we are huge fans of Hells Kitchen and it was her birthday. Our original waiter was excellent, he was trying to manage multiple tables so our food was delayed. Everything was going well until a party of 20 arrived, some of the staff referred to this party as a group of \"tattooed & piercing people.\" Not sure what the relevance of that comment was about. Anyway, while eating our appetizers a short red haired lady with an \"ankle tattoo\" arrived at our table. She placed her hand on my plate asking if I was done, I said no. My fiance wore a tiara, ankle tattoo made a rude comment saying \"I hope it's your birthday or are you a princess for the day.\" Minutes go by when Ankle tattoo arrives with our entrees, while I'm still eating my appetizer she moves my plate to the side without even asking. I later found out from our server, ankle tattoo was the BLT manager. Feeling disrespected and on an dinning time limit, my fiance and I took our uneaten entrees to go. This was our first and last time at BLT steakhouse. I have been in touch with PR, hopefully they can hire professionally considerate management from this point forward.",

My wife and I had the porterhouse for two. It was cooked well inside but had some chard burnt tasting areas from the outside on certain  areas. It was just good to okay. I did not like the French onion soup at all. My wife's crab cake was okay (she said it was decent, I thought it tasted \"fishy\"(not fresh) ). The loaded baked potato was good(good sized potato comes with sour cream, bacon, chives and cheese on the side). The truffle mash was strong tasting to me( tasted like I was eating pure garlic but my wife enjoyed it but said two to three bites was enough for her because of the strong flavor). I would say for the price you can find a better expensive steak restaurant. The one in the Belagio in front of the water was way better(can't think of the name right now).",

Anyway, last Monday, I took my wife to BLT's new place in Vegas for her birthday.  She had eaten at their place in Scottsdale and enjoyed it.  Monday is a quiet night in the restaurant business so I figured let's do it.   Staff was nice, but for a high end steak joint what a disappointment!  No drinks ordered, no appetizer.  Had their \"signature\" popovers, which were over baked (Hard outside and not fluffy inside like they should be).  Well, we looked forward to our steaks.  Wife ordered a filet, I ordered a bone in rib eye. We made small talk for 20 minutes.  Then 30 minutes.  Then an hour.   FINALLY a full 1 1/2 hours later we got the steaks.  Both were ordered med.  rare.  Wife's was fine, mine was close to raw.  Let's say very rare.  Asked to have it cooked more.  Manager comes back in 10 minutes with a medium cooked steak.  Let's see, 1 1/2 hours for the first steak (Very rare) , 10 minutes for the second (Medium).  Something doesn't compute?   When we got home I researched out the company phone number in NY.   Contact is normally via email on their website.   I was pi$$ed and wanted to vent.  Young woman said a \"director\" will call me.  Nada, no call.   They obviously don't care about customer retention or brand loyalty.   Lots of restaurant choices in Vegas so they obviously don't count on return customers.   Won't go back.   Also, won't go to BLTs in other cities. $155 birthday dinner and it was a lousy experience!",

    "text": "I've eaten here twice, a few years apart, and one thing was consistent: Bad, slow service. We actually had the same waiter both times, and both times he seemed more interested in upselling us things then actually providing good service. When you're in vegas, you don't want to sit around waiting to order, waiting for the food, waiting for the check. It puts a real damper on the whole experience.   On to the food: liver jelly amuse bouche- Pretty tasty and fun for those that rarely go near liver.  Popovers - Delicious. I could eat these all day. hot and fresh, butter and salt to top it off make it divine.  fresh vegetable salad - Great flavor, and nice portion size. I didn't know what was in the salad, and was pleasantly surprised to see plenty of pieces of avocado and big chunks of feta. The dressing tasted fresh and was delightful. It was a nice item to have before a big hunk of steak.  Filet mignon - Just OK. I got it medium rare, and it was cooked to that temperature. The outside of the steak was really good, with a nice tasty crust. However, the inside was too tough and chewy for filet. I want the steak to be extremely tender at these prices. Ruth's Chris beats this every time, hands down.  I also got the red wine sauce for $2 with the steak. it's lame to me they charge you $2 for a sauce when you're paying $60 for a steak, but whatever, it was still tasty. I recommend the sauce to add a little something to the filet experience.  Bone-in ribeye - my friend had this and was not pleased at all. He is a big steak eater, and said it was overcooked and not very good. I didn't try it, but that was his two cents.  Overall - great salad, great bread, overpriced meh steak, and horrible service. We won't be back.",

    "text": "The wife and I recently dined at BLT Steak at Bally's Las Vegas.  We were seated shortly after checking in at the front for our reservations.  They asked us if we were celebrating anything, and we told them it was an anniversary. The kitchen and staff were awesome in that they gave us two flutes of champagne and a duck pate appetizer on the house. Totally unexpected, but a very nice gesture.  We ordered a burrata appetizer and had the popovers. Both were good, but very filling so we had limited space left for the entrees.  Both of us ordering the bone-in ribeye probably didn't help, but the steaks came out perfectly medium rare.  They came with a pat of melting herb butter, roasted garlic clove, and a small bone marrow with accompanying small spoon....delish! We had the truffle mash potatoes and the roasted brussel sprouts.  While both sides were thankfully small, the potatoes were on the meh side, but the brussel sprouts were quite good.  We both had a wine by the glass with our meal.   We were in a bit of a rush to catch a show so we couldn't get dessert, much less have space for it anyway.",

    "text": "Our party of three came here for dinner before attending shows elsewhere on the Strip. We were the first customers to be seated early on a Saturday evening. BLT Steak has a modern steakhouse feel-dark woods, comfortable seats, soft lighting-and is tucked away in the back corner of Bally's, which cuts down on casino noise.   Service was excellent. Our server cheerfully answered all of our questions, and we had a lot of them. Although she barely looked old enough to drink, she made a great wine recommendation. Portion sizes were fairly generous, save for the grilled branzino I had that was pretty tiny. Salads are big enough for 2 people to share. The \"famous\" popovers are also large and quite filling, so keep that in mind. Other than the size of my entree, the only other criticism of the food was my husband's bone-in strip was a little over seasoned...but it must not have been too bad because he still ate the whole thing!  Prices-especially for drinks-are expensive but on par with comparable steakhouses on the Strip. We each had one glass of champagne and one glass of wine, which accounted for nearly a third of our total bill. But if you're on vacation like we were, and cost is no object, BLT Steak is a great choice.",

You're not set to a strict choice, and they make it easy to use.  Our meal started with a complimentary duck confit and the \"famous\" popovers (which met the hype for sure!). We ordered the shrimp cocktail appetizer.. which were 4 huge meaty shrimp with lemon and sauce- so fresh and so good! We also split a Caesar salad which had a nice dressing we enjoyed. Our main meal choices were the 10oz filet mignon and the rack of lamb, which were absolutely mouth watering!! The lamb was the winner here though!! We also enjoyed mac and cheese, along with the stuffed mushrooms as our side dishes-both were devoured!! Last but not least we shared a peanut butter chocolate mousse- it was rich! Needless to say we were completely stuffed and definitely got our money's worth!! Our service was also amazing, our server was very informative, helpful, and so nice! The people seated next to us were extremely rude, and I felt the staff handled their \"situation\" so well without disturbing our experience.  We loved it and would hope to go back!!",

They start the meal with popovers, which were excellent, they serve it with the recipe so you can attempt to make at home.  We started our meal with the crab cakes which had the perfect crab to bread ratio.  With the mains we had onion rings (big, crisp and the perfect coating) mashed potato (creamy) and the brussels sprouts (mixed with bacon).  Dessert was a delicious piece of banana cream pie, with a thick crunchy graham and nut crust and the filling had big chunks of banana.  I'll be back!",

I ordered their bloody mary extra spicy. Yummy!  They gave us complimentary bread and duck liver mousse with crostinis. I'm not much of a bread person but the duck liver was perfect. Wished they gave more crostinis.  As for the food, here's what I ordered/got to try:  - Oysters - OMG super fresh!  - Manchego Grits - Not bad. I probably could have done without it.  - Truffle Mashed Potatoes - A bit more watery than your average mashed potatoes but SO flavorful.  - Brussel Sprouts - Crispy goodness  - Creamed Spinach - Not the best I've had  - Ribeye Steak - A M A Z I N G! Came with bone marrow too.  Everyone got a complimentary chocolate truffle at the end. Topped everything off just right. We were all stuffed to say the least and had some delicious leftovers for later when we got drunk munchies. Highly recommended!",

The jelly was smooth and mild. It wasn't sweet at all. More of a savory rich taste. There was something beneath the jelly which looks like peanut butter but tastes nothing like it. Perhaps it was almond butter? There was a complimentary bread that was nice and steamy when you broke it open. One of the best breads I have had at a restaurant.  I ordered the 10 oz filet mignon cooked medium rare. Very juicy and great with the added butter. The chef also provided complimentary dessert. Brownie bites. So much complimentary appetizers and sweets that I didn't even order any. I am a stuffed animal now.  Server was very attentive and did a good job. Always on the look out for you.

When I got to the front desk and stated all of this, the 2 girls working \"couldn't find anything\" for about 5 min at which point I gave up and just walked into the restauran to find them on my own.  When I found my friends, they mentioned that they had ordered an appetizer already, but there were no drinks in sight. I was there about 10 min before the server, David, came by to take a drink order...which meant my friends had been waiting even longer for theirs. We ordered 3 wines and an ice tea. We mentioned the long wait for the appetizer and were told the kitchen was busy despite the fact that the restaurant was not full and my friend had ordered tartare. In my opinion, this just wasn't a good answer...just apologize & go check on it.  We got our wines, but the ice tea never came. We ordered salads, a crab cake appetizer, and a 2nd tartare. These took an equally long time and the crab cake was cold. Things were taking SO long that we didn't even bother ordering entrees because we had show tickets and we were afraid we would miss it.  Our server disappeared, and we finally waved down a busser in an attempt to ask for the check. This, of course, also took forever. We split the bill so I didn't get a full total, but a Caesar salad, a crab cake, and a glass of wine came to $52. NOT worth it by a mile!!!",

When you sit down they give you pop overs made with milk and Gruyere cheese it's good but will fill you up. Then they give you complementary pate with crustini and some sliced chucuteri. So don't over do it on the appetizers you'll get full before the main course and won't enjoy the steak.   Just a tip any high end restaurant in Las Vegas you don't need to dress up if you go to the bar, they have the full menu.  I was able to get into BLT wearing shorts and shirt. I'm sure they rather have you dress  business casual but basically if you can afford it they take your business.  Porter house and 2 sides which is a lot of food for two was $125 not bad.",

Only the Crab cakes left something to be desired (too much cake, not enough crab for $16). The highlight of BLT though is the steaks. Our group had Fillets and bone in Ribeye and everyone said it was one of the better, if not best steaks they could remember having. The side items are all A la carte, with the Mac n Cheese and Brussels sprouts being the best. Not huge portions, but enough for everyone to get a forkful. Booze pricing was good for Vegas = $8 Beers & $12 Call brand with a healthy shot. Service was attentive and while the overall atmosphere wasn't anything spectacular, the Steaks made up for it.",

First off, the lady who answered the phone to take the reservation (I think her name was Shen) was super friendly and accommodating. Once we arrive at the restaurant, our server David was amazing. Because we are members of the Diamond club, the chef sent us complimentary appetizers and dessert. We were a party of 8 and the food all arrived together and hot. Everyone was gushing over their meals. We ordered food writer, tuna tartare, and meet tartare and bacon for our appetizers. They were all perfect. They also brought us complementary bread popovers that are buttery and delicious. We each ordered different steaks and they were cooked To perfection. One party ordered the Branzino but changed her mind and they replaced it immediately with her second choice which was a lobster salad which she loved. Portions are HUGE. The dessert is amazing- we had almost everything and all of it was good. If you order the sorbet, you get four scoops so be sure to ask for different flavors if you so desire. Overall, one of the best restaurants in Vegas. Wow.",

    "text": "Bought a Groupon worth $160 for $125 and was able to use immediately.  Had a reservation but there was no wait for a weekday dinner.  We started with the complimentary popovers then ordered the grilled bacon appetizer topped with chimichurri sauce. The bacon itself was good, but overall, the dish was very salty. I'm guessing there was salt in the chimichurri which was not necessary. The bacon was not warm when it reached the table. Should have ordered it a little crispy.  I had the 10oz filet mignon, and bf had the pumpkin seed & herb halibut from the daily specials menu. My filet was cooked perfectly and had great seasoning. Bf's halibut was delicious. He ordered carrot risotto; he liked it and texture with spot on (rich and creamy), but I didn't care for it since it was on the sweeter side.   Our server, Sergio, was good as was his helper, but service got slow towards the end when we were waiting on dessert and the check. We asked for dessert to go. To get to $160, we ordered two desserts: banana cream pie and s'mores cheesecake. Sergio said he could bring the marshmallow ice cream from the s'mores cheesecake, so we could enjoy it now; however, when it got to us, it was 25% melted (which he pointed out). The yellow banana layer tasted like fake banana. Luckily, the chocolate cheesecake was good, very rich.",

    "text": "Who would've thought that one of my favorite dishes from a recent trip to Vegas was a popover?  Yep, among the scrumptious burgers from Gordon Ramsey, the juicy yolk from Eggslut, and even the cheesy orgasm from Secret Pizza, it was my first experience with this crispy, flaky appetizer roll that landed near the top.   Let me provide some context. So a few weeks ago, my girlfriend and I made a quick trip to the Las Vegas strip during Labor Day weekend. Because we wanted to \"splurge\" just once, we made plans to try a fancy steakhouse on our first day. Unfortunately, we didn't plan ahead and make reservations so a lot of the top places were booked for the night (<a href=\"/redir?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.google.com%2Famp%2Fs%2Fwww.thrillist.com%2Famphtml%2Feat%2Flas-vegas%2Fbest-steakhouse-in-las-vegas&s=fdb6a369dd4d405f164fea9a624b92f64314bcb7a1ecd744ee54a8f413bb3981\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">google.com/amp/s/www.thr...</a>). Luckily, we managed to find a spot at BLT Steak.   With over 30 locations around the globe, BLT is no stranger to the steak game. The Las Vegas restaurant was found inside Bally's Hotel, right next to Paris. Not sure if we actually needed a reservation though since there were plenty of seats and we got a table within minutes after checking in.  For their steak, they had 7 options that broke into normal cuts (NY strip, Cowboy, Filet Mignon, Porterhouse, and Kansas City) and Wagyu (Prime and Filet). BLT also offered a decent number of non-steak options as well that included lobster, fish, a bunch of sides, and some salads. Not really gonna talk too much about price because you know the deal with these places. Steak options will range from $60-$115 depending on the cut and size.  My girlfriend and I ended up sharing the 10oz Fillet Mignon, their Burrata side, and the seasonal Scalloped Baked Potatoes. Here's what we thought of the experience:  -- PRETTY DARN GOOD FOOD, BUT COSTLY -- I usually don't drop a ton of $$$ on restaurants because I'm a pretty cheap guy but I appreciate extravagance once in a while. For the most part, the food at BLT was stellar but I thought the price point was a bit too high.   1. Fillet Mignon (8/10): This was some darn good steak! It was extremely juicy, the cut was well cooked, and every piece felt tender and melted in our mouths. I loved the extra touch of rosemary and butter on top too. I wasn't too impressed with the Bearnaise sauce though, and I felt like I've had better fillet for much less.  2. Scallop Potatoes (8/10): Small portion size, but very savory and filling! Extra cheesy on the inside, however it could've been fried more evenly.  3. Burrata (9/10): This was more of an appetizer than a salad, and boy we actually enjoyed this one! Though pricier than it should've been for the tiny amount, the tomatoes were juicy, basil was fresh, and the basil vinaigrette was glorious.  4. House Popovers (10/10): SO AMAZING! BEST PART OF MEAL. We got served a GIGANTIC helping of the crispiest, cheesiest creation. I loved that they gave us the recipe and there's no way this didn't have butter in it.   -- AVERAGE SERVICE, NO HIGHLIGHTS -- Not much to say about the service. We were left alone most of our dinner and it took a while for our food to come out too but that was expected.   -- INTIMATE ATMOSPHERE, FAR FROM CASINO -- Loved the dim lighting and quiet ambiance. I'm so glad we weren't anywhere near the loud, smelly cloud of the casino area. We were able to enjoy each other's company quite well.   All in all, I thought BLT Steak was a solid choice for a steakhouse along the Las Vegas strip. Kinda sad we couldn't find a more local restaurant but no worries. Food was pretty great (THE POPOVER), but I probably wouldn't come again due to the price. Glad to experience it and will give BLT a \"Nice-su, you can take your parents here and they'll be happy\" rating. Thank you moo moos for this amazing steak!  Eat well and prosper,",

Our waiter was so busy he was pretty much making jokes while walking away from the table.  The restaurant environment is really nice, the price is what you expect for a nice steak house. I just think they were just too understaffed or not prepared for the amount of tables for each server. I felt like i was dining at black angus or outback steakhouse with this service.   Even though the steaks were way overcooked, it was still good. Their bread was pretty delicious.",

    "text": "This review is about the Sterling Buffet, the amazing, high-end, all-you-can-eat, Sunday brunch at BLT.  After having visited once before, the availability of this buffet literally dictated the days of the visit to Las Vegas this go-around.    BOOK MONTHS IN ADVANCE, reservations are tough to get.  Why the huge demand?  I can make a short list.  All-you-can-eat lobster, filets, crab, caviar, sushi.....I could go on for many more lines.  Oh, and bottomless champagne -- PERRIER JOUET at that!  We arrived at our reservation time but still had to wait about 15 minutes.  But we were given our first glasses of champagne at the door.  So, I could have waited a few more minutes!    Once you are seated, a server will bring you water, top off your champagne, explain the buffet layout and you're off to the races.  Round one was stone crab legs, lobster, bacon (just because) and potato and chorizo hash.  Round two was a petite filet, caviar, asparagus and bacon (just because).  I went back for more caviar and some sushi before moving on to the wonderful dessert spread.    The desserts are all petite and gorgeously made encouraging you to try a vast array of flavors and textures.    Are these the creme de la creme examples of each type of food?  No.  But they are very good examples and you can totally glutton out at a buffet in Vegas that doesn't have just roast beef and mashed potatoes as the 'stars'.",

She definitely deserves a shout out for keeping up with great service all these years!  Josh kept our water glass and drinks filled, constantly checked on us and took empty plates away. Love BLT!",

    "text": "The waiter acted like I was going to dine and dash!  I arrived at BLT Steak at around 5pm with a friend. At the beginning our waiter was pleasant, but when we didn't order an alcoholic beverage or an appetizer his personality changed. I'm not 21, I can't drink. I'm also around 90 pounds, so the thought of an appetizer on top of a hefty steak was a no go for me.  Our food soon arrived and it was wonderful. The steak was cooked perfectly and their baked potatoes are HUGE! Everything tasted perfect.   Shortly after that, the manager started hovering around our table, and the other waiters and bussers were glaring at us. We looked a little out of place (my friend and I were dressed rather casually) but I thought nothing of it at first.  When I was about half-way down with my steak, I realized the waiter hadn't visited our table in quite awhile. He was busy with the platinum members and more \"put together\" customers. To be honest I think anyone who has a reservation here should be treated with decency and respect, and not ignored for customers paying more money.   I ended up having to get up from the table and ask the hovering manager where I could find a restroom. They don't have one inside of the restaurant. It was quite a ways away.  While I was gone the waiter asked my friend if I WAS GOING TO COME BACK. He said \"because she left her stuff\". Uhm yeah left my stuff because I planned on coming back, not because I was dining and dashing.  The only person who didn't treat us differently was one of the bussers, and we made sure to tip him well.   I am extremely disappointed. Doesn't matter if I'm in a fur coat or a shirt and jeans, I had a reservation, and I have every right to be there.  I will not be visiting this location again. Shame on everyone working here.",

I followed that up with a 6oz American Wagyu Filet paired with a nice Pinot Noir.  My side was mashed potatoes.  All in all it was a pretty good steak dinner.  It was a bit pricey to me, but that's only because I had pretty much the same meal 2 nights later for half the price.  The Wagyu was good... much like the A5 Kobe; I was a little underwhelmed.  The crab cake was delicious.  Although I'm not a fan of the radish salad.  The potatoes were great!  The paired wine was excellent as well.  Again, the service was impeccable.  Attentive without being intrusive...",

I did some research and \"traveled\" from the Mandalay Bay, where I was staying to Bally's for BLT...AND it was well worth it!! I had the 16oz NY strip and a nice sized baked potato. The build it yourself side cart that comes with the baked potato is a very nice touch!! The steak was unbelievable and the service was fantastic. They also have these complementary beard rolls, called \"popovers\" and it was ridiculously good with the honey butter and sea salt!! I didn't take a picture of it, because I was starving and had no time for pics!! There's plenty of pictures of them on here from other yelpers. This place is very good people, I HIGHLY RECOMMEND this steakhouse.",

    "text": "The Sterling Brunch served at BLT Steak inside Bally's Hotel and Casino on Sunday mornings is surely a five star affair. A reservation is highly recommended because this brunch is so popular and delightful that you may not get in without one. We made ours weeks in advance and were super excited on the day we visited.   The experience is drenched in luxurious pampering as servers dressed in tuxedos begin your service with a pop of a cork and what turns out to be endless pours of Perrier Jouet champagne, accompanied by orange juice if you like. Next, comes the \"popovers\" which are supersized warm from the oven yeast rolls that melt in your mouth with cream butter. You are then invited to visit the buffet station where you are overwhelmed by omelets made to order, hand carved Nueske's bacon, filet mignon, lobster tails, king crab legs, slow roasted prime rib, lobster ravioli, grilled salmon, fresh made sushi, chilled shrimp, oysters on the half shell, and more. You enjoy all you can eat as your server continues to remove your empty plates and top off you champagne flute.   Finally before you get too full you breeze by the dessert table where you have your choice of bite size sweets and delicacies including flan, cheesecake, chocolate mousse in mini martini glasses and cake pops. As you throw your crisp cloth napkin on your plate and push yourself away from the table, you realize that you are so well pleased that you vow to tell all your friends and family and the entire Yelp community about this splendid experience at the best brunch you've ever had. And you swear that you have to try BLT Steak for dinner sometime.",

The coupon stated we had to get certain things but the waiter said we were allowed to just spend until we hit our limit. Our table went with an assortment of appetizers, steak,seafood, and different desserts. I started with popover bread and lobster and shrimp seasonal cake. Popover was light and very well baked. The cake was different but very fresh. Forgot what the sauce was but it was amazing!   The steaks were cooked perfectly. I went with the bone in ribeye. The waiter mistakenly put the wrong order in so by the time I got my steak my table was finished eating but it was worth the wait. The steak was cooked perfectly medium rare and seasoned beautifully. I had an order of mashed potatoes and they were good nothing to rave about but good.  We ended up trying out about every drink on the menu and I'll be the first to say there were no bad ones. Old Cuban, BLT Cocktail, and Jagged Edge were great!   Besides a couple hiccups food was amazing! If you're thinking about it do it and I'd suggest the coupon which is very useful! Will be visiting again next time I'm in town!",

    "text": "I very rarely leave anything but 5 star reviews.. yet this place deserves 1 star. Had dinner here on Saturday night with my sweetheart on a spontaneous weekend getaway. Table for two, and they put us in the darkest furthest corner of the place. Lupita was our server. Rather than tell us about the place, or about the food, or about the specials, she merely handed us a paper menu and walked away. Meanwhile at another table close to us, another male server was describing how things were cooked, he explained the specials, etc. We felt like the red headed stepchildren set in the corner! We didn't realize that no side dishes accompanied the entrees. We ordered mashed potatoes that arrived looking like a bowl full of grey glue. They were not good, yet no one bothered to ask how they were when they picked up the full dish later.  We also ordered dessert. We asked questions about one of the specials and our server seemed too bothered to answer them. Then she brought out a dish with tiny bites of cake pops and brownie bites, but she didn't explain they were different flavors. One was a peanut butter bite.. thank goodness we didn't have a peanut allergy!  I'm giving one star here because the steaks were actually cooked perfectly and the gentleman who filled our water glasses was very attentive and pleasant. So I guess it wasn't a colossal waste of time. But what should have been a romantic dinner in an upscale restaurant became annoying and certainly not worth the expense.  This place does a Sunday breakfast, and we thought maybe we'd give this place another try, we thought maybe we just caught them on a bad night, since we observed the other dinner table having such good service. Unfortunately, the next morning the hostess seemed too busy when we arrived, telling us we could just find a spot to sit in the bar. We asked if we wanted a table how long the wait would be. She seemed very put out that she had to go look at the dining area, and came back and said \"uhh maybe like I don't know around 40 minutes\". For $100+ per person for breakfast, and her unprofessional and unenthusiastic attitude, it was very easy for us to decide to go elsewhere.  We really wanted to love this place. The steaks were fantastic. The popovers were also delicious. Everything else was mediocre at best. Certainly this was the very worst service we experienced the entire trip.",

The Crabcakes are the best I've ever had, and they are a generous size which was a bonus. Oysters were tasty. Filet Mignon was so tender and tasty! Although it is inside Bally's, the restaurant ambience was upscale. (We called ahead and they said pants required.) Oh wait.. almost forgot about the bread! It is a popover bakes with gruyere cheese.. melt in your mouth bread. I would come just to try this again! We will definitely be coming back!

We shared the macaroni and cheese and the onion rings. The mac and cheese was very flavorful. I didn't love the onion ring batter, it was smooth. I prefer the batter crispy and crunchy but that's a personal preference.  My boyfriend loved everything. I thought it was okay, although I did love the NY strip.

Our server was Javier, was amaizing. They gave us a delicious cheese bread, it was like nothing else I've tasted before, and they give you the recipe so you can make it at home. I recommend the short ribs, plenty of meat that's braised in wine..yumm... and around $40 for the plate; sides are a la carte but, for example, one side of mashed potatoes is more than enough for two people, so if you're trying to keep it economical that's a good thing to remember.",

(I was informed that they are a newer restaurant on the strip and using Groupon to get more business & reviews). There were multiple other choices but my fiance and I hadn't tried this restaurant yet so we thought we'd give it a go. Food was excellent, service was excellent and they even did a special champagne toast as soon as we told the wait staff we were celebrating our recent engagement. We ordered the Porterhouse for two, split a Caesar salad & mashed potatoes and it was plenty of food and we even had leftovers. Definitely a hidden Gem!! We made made reservations , but it was a Monday night and it wasn't that busy and we didn't really need them. P.S. the fresh baked popovers are ridiculously amazing!!!",

    "text": "I see all of these positive reviews and my group of three, well, we won't be back to this location.  And it wasn't because of the food or the complimentary dessert bites because the food was indeed savory.  It was because of the waiter that serviced our table.  He was snooty and flat out rude.  My companions both ordered steak, it is after all a steakhouse and they received wonderfully prepared steaks that were quite large.  In fact large enough that you could take half of a piece home.  My husband and I shared one.  That is what got us \"on the bad side\" of the waiter.  But the truth is, neither of us could have eaten an entire steak ourselves.  And because I wasn't ordering my own meal, I was not entitled to water refills.  That's right you heard me, our waiter (not the busboy) would not refill my water glass when he filled my husband's glass and his colleague's glass.  In fact, the waiter would not acknowledge my presence whatsoever.  As a result he had 3 very unhappy, unsatisfied customers that felt he did not deserve a tip.   The bus boy was my personal waiter and we did tip him privately and the hostesses were polite and kind.  The three of us vowed not to return.  Next time we'll walk over to Paris and try Gordon Ramsey Steak as we know the steak will be just as good but perhaps the manager does a better job ensuring how his customers are treated by his staff.  Oh, and just so you know, the steaks were $50 a piece, if you wanted potatoes you paid an additional $10, if you wanted vegetables, you had to pay an additional $15.  If you do not order dessert the chef will send out a spoon-sized bite of dessert to top off the orders (in our case we received two, but that's fine by husband doesn't do sweets).  That was a classy touch, but I am sure it is meant to encourage you to change your mind and order dessert.  Had we received better service we would have ordered two desserts, one for myself and one for my husband's colleague.  We spent over $160 on dinner and had very little customer service at the table (the waiter seemed to be avoiding us altogether) So it goes to show, how the waiter treats the customer does impact how much the party is willing to spend and whether they will return or recommend to friends.  In our case, the recommendations are to avoid BLT Steak at Ballys!",

Our servers were very friendly and attentive which added to the experience. It was the perfect mix between casual and dressy.

I'm a chef and have worked in several high end steak houses as the broiler chef. This porter house $96 would have never been served at any establishment I have ever been to or worked for. The steak was cut before it was cooked because the waiter forgot to ring it in so they cheated and it came out terrible. We told the waiter nicely and he told his manager. We waited and ate around the raw (not rare, raw) meat while waiting. We had a show to get to and couldn't wait another 30 minutes for another steak.He came over 20 minutes later and gave us a 20 percent discount? We didn't even eat 20 percent of the steak!  We were very disappointed and believe Gordon Ramsey is a fake. There are many other places to dine on the strip but will never waste our time in another one of your restaurants.",

    "text": "If you want a popover - fine! If you want a steak - go somewhere else. I was tempted to leave it only one star but we have to have leeway for more terrible restaurants, thought that is hard to imagine.  The main complaint: the steak was not quite warm and certainly never got hotter. They serve the steak in what appears to be a cast iron skillet. One would imagine that this could keep the meat at a desirable eating temperature, but not if it was not warmed initially, nor the steak was hot when placed in the skillet. When serving, they place a dab of butter on the steak and ours was so cool that the butter never fully melted, just got limp a bit.  Next, they promote the steak as being prime - I sincerely doubt it. Aside from the sinew running through it, a good portion of it, the fat layer on the outside was much too large. Now, Prime connotes a certain degree of fat, that is what makes it prime, but that is fat that is in the meat, marbling, not a half inch or more around the outside that did nothing to enhance the taste or flavor. It was Saturday night,and they were not busy - with good reason!. There is a discount coupon available at Tix4tonight that will save you 30% (on the food only - shortsighted) and it is still not worth it. The oysters were good, and with the discount reasonable.  I could go on and complain about the service, the creamed spinach and there were some good points, but so over weighed by the bad, that I will not go there - nor should you. .",

The popovers were, expectedly, warm, buttery and delicious. What we did not expect were the additional duck liver raspberry pate, mini-pizza slices and assorted meat plates that the chef sent over simply by being a Diamond Rewards card member. Good thing we forgot to order the Tuna Tartare that we had our eye on!  The 28 day-aged Ribeye did it disappoint. Perfectly marbled with gooey fat and lightly charred to make the spices dance in your mouth. It was a good thing we decided to taste the Short Ribs after the ribeye because, seriously, this dish is the star of the night. Melt in your mouth, fork tender, buttery ... Oh la la. Our server, David, was on the money when he said the short ribs were probably the best thing on the menu. I would visit BLT Steak again for this dish alone.  With no more room left for dessert, we were again pleasantly surprised when the chef sent over another two complimentary plates: peanut butter jelly and passion fruit pops + brownie bites. A fantastic end to a delightful culinary inclined night.",

He had it with peppercorn sauce and he loved it. When I ordered the shrimp cocktail waitress made a face. That disappointed my husband and wanted to walk out. Other than that enjoyed the popovers and baked potato and the asparagus were amazing!! Loved the VIP platter that they bring to the table to try. Duck liver wasn't too bad. I only wish my wine was chilled when served. Not sure if we'll return but it was an \"OK\" experience!",

If you are ever at Bally's and choose to check out this new, trending place thanks to Hell's Kitchen and sit at the bar, you will know what I mean. If he is working. Just our menus and a drink please fella, hold the attitude. You are not so above working here. However, a gal that was newer on bar was amazing, saved the night and resumed our confidence to order (She gets 5 stars). She was under a sharp eye, training to make specialty drinks and asked if we could be her testers. UM, SURE! We tried almost all of the specialty cocktails on the menu and none of them were bad. Enjoyed them all. Especially the blackberry mule. Food coming out to others looked amazing - burgers, steaks, onion rings in tower form. I hope this new, friendly, female bartender stays on here. She was super grateful for her job and and saved our visit by doing it well with a smile. I hope she got our $$ tip but likely not, sadly. Try the original, sinful pan bread they bring out before your order (so good they hand you the recipe with the bread!) and the beet salad. Very good.",

While we did use a groupon, we were also drinking and very friendly, as was our server, so the few reviews that mentioned this to be an issue, I think may be outliers.  Sides were great, service was top notch, steak was cooked to my specifications and had a really fantastic taste.  The server, bus team, and hostess were all great, now, I realize that 2 weeks before Christmas is off season, but I'm not in anyway going to hold that as the only reason they were great to us...I think it was because they're really good at their jobs, and, well, I'm fun, LOL.  Still not sure if the happy birthday plate was my brother or he just gave them a heads up and did this.  Either way, I had a great time, and ate some great food with some great family and friends.",

    "text": "BLT is located inside Bally's, one of the older hotel casinos.   The menu is ala cart. I had the bone-in ribeye. $60. Was it worth it? Well, consider the meat is excellent, the steak was large and this restaurant comes with all the pretense of a high-priced steakhouse, yeah, sure, if you want to treat yourself.   I also got a baked potato which was the size of a small football. They must be growing these is some of abandoned nuclear test sites nearby. Total meal price: $90  I found the wall bench seating and the table height out of sync. The table was so high I felt like I was back at the kids table at Thanksgiving. I had to reach up to keep my sleeves out of things and kept knocking things over. I noticed the same thing at another Bally's restaurant. It seems to be an overall design flaw.   I thought it was funny that you are given a complimentary \"popup\" I believe they called it. It's really just Yorkshire Pudding (flour, water baked in hot oil until it puffs out).   So it's a good place for a treat. It's highbrow for Bally's. Be careful ordering too much. The serving sizes are big.",

    "text": "Excellent food, excellent service.  Pleasantly surprised having known about this a la carte steakhouse for many years.    Pretty flawless experience.  My mom and I had a hundred dollar credit.    No one could dine with us and we are light eaters.  Decided to splurge at the steakhouse.   The steaks were a bit pricey even for a la carte, but the filet was a large 10 oz only, so we ordered one and split it w a side of mashed potatoes and the Mac n cheese.  We also ordered the spinach bacon salad.    We were presented with a compliments of the house bite size appetizer and then was presented with a charcuterie plate of four meats and a duck pate for our diamond status.  We were not expecting this and would have saved for desert instead of sides and salads.  But very good and very nice.   I didn't like the duck pate at all.  I am sure it was very nice though.  Lol.    Steak was excellent, albeit we ordered medium and it was very medium rare (which made me happy anyway, not the mother).     The sides were both very tasty, although on the small side for $12.  If we were not light eaters, they were not sharable, which is entirely too pricey.   Mashed and Mac are just mashed and Mac after all.    The only main criticism would be the salad it was a fail.  It needs removed from menu.  The Flavors were not there, the dressing was nonexistent.  The flavors came from the very good, but bulky and almost jerky like chewy inch squares of bacon and the also very good when you had some blue cheese.   However, eating some jerky bacon before a nice steak kind of defeats the purpose of a smooth steak.  We had decided we had entirely too much food anyway and had them box it for my husband.  It was edible, but paired poorly and executed poorly.    Ahh, forgot the popovers.  We were also served two huge hot and fresh popovers before the salad.     Drinks were filled continuously, yet no staff were overbearing.  Plates were cleared and table was kept timely and throughout.     Honestly, for a very good quality meal and a lot of meal we were at $100 for two people.  Although again we ordered one entree by design.   We would never eat two steaks and still brought half of one home for my husband.  I would actually recommend or return to this steakhouse again if needing to entertain or a special occasion.",

Concierge at Diamond Club told us she likes BLT the best so we went for it. Interior decor wasn't anything to write home about. Everyone was very friendly - from the hosts to waiter to wait staff. We shared a bone in strip- it arrived already cut up in pieces which was interesting. It tasted fine. Also ordered stuffed mushroom caps and asparagus- both were fine. My husband did like the popover bread- raves about it.  We usually go to Morton's for steak at home in Denver and I felt the food here was not as good- just fine. No flavors really stood out.",

Drinks: Watermelon Basil which is what I was going to order (Ketel, Cointreau, Muddled Watermelon and Basil).  Hugo recommended the Got My Mojo Workin': I wasn't crazy about the thought of Ginger Green Tea in it but it was delicious! (I ordered two!)  The Cool Woodford was NOT our cup of tea but then again we aren't really bourbon drinkers - it was QUITE strong!   Chef Compliments: Duck Liver Pate with Port Jelly was salty and not bad tasting.   Popover bread with Gruyere cheese wasn't the best for either of us but interesting with the cheese baked right in the bread. I did like the crispiness of the bread with the light cheese taste, butter and sprinkled salt.   Salad: Lobster Salad was SO good! Like SOOO good!! Big pieces of lobster in a Cobb style salad with crispy bacon, half a soft boiled egg, crispy onion straws, different types of lettuce and a delicious house made  Buttermilk Ranch dressing - this could actually be a light meal or almost too much as a starter salad because of all the goodies in it! Just pick out all the lobster and other good stuff and leave the lettuce behind... I MOST DEFINITELY RECOMMEND THIS SALAD!  Bibb Salad w/Manchego cheese, beets and a Mustard Vinaigrette was tasty as well - better for a starter for dinner and less filling than the Lobster salad.  Mains: 2lb Lobster from Maine: poached AND grilled to retain its juciness. I love seafood and this was juicy and delish! I MOST DEFINITELY RECOMMEND THIS ENTREE! I pretty much ate it ALL all by myself!  Waygu Rib eye: Ordered medium rare was cooked perfectly. The flavor was very good, crispiness on the outside but chewey and flavorful. A little salty for me, but some people enjoy theirs more on the salty side.  Desserts/After dinner drinks:  Crepe Souffle: passion fruit, fluffiness, sweetness, tartness and with the burnt sugar to boot!   Warm Chocolate Tart w/ pistachio ice cream: Ummm I LOOOVED the pistachio ice cream!! The tart itself was a little bitter for me, I'm more of a milk chocolate type of gal but it was moist and rich on the inside.   Grand Cafe: Friend loved it.  Moscato D'Asti!!! Sweet and delicious!  Chamomile tea w/honey as if I wasn't already in a food coma, this will really help put me to sleep!  Everything was delicious and service was excellent from every staff member on the floor.",

It's a reasonable price given the quality of the food.   They have lobster tails, prime rib, pork belly, king crab, caviar, bass, braised short ribs--I cant even remember all the variety.  The meat was tender, the seafood was fresh, and the desserts were perfectly decadent.  The Cesar salad came separately dished, meats and cheese dishes were ready-to-go, and other sides such as personal whipped cream cups were also pre-prepared. I thought this was a thoughtful touch. It's more personalized rather than picking out your own salad from a large tray.  My husband and I sat at the bar because he didn't make a reservation... So make a reservation! We signed up for the waitlist at 10 and got seated at about 11:10 a.m.. I knocked a star for that, just because we had the impression we would be seated closest to 10:30 am",

With that said, I do expect exceptional service which our server did not deliver.   First choice of dining was Gordon Ramsey and Nobu but unfortunately they were all committed so since I originally had a great experience here, I decided to return here.   We were a party of 3. When we arrived no one was at the front podium. We waited for about 5 minutes and finally a female started running to the front to greet us. She said it would take another 5 minutes to seat us. Eventually a couple more hosts walked up to the front.   Our server greeted us a few minutes later and distributed our menus to us. He asked what kind of water we wanted; Pellegrino, Tap or Fiji. We said \"option B\" aka Tap and he says Fiji? He kind of gave us a little smirk.   Food:  *Smoked Bacon with Chimichurri Sauce *Tuna Tartare  *22 OZ Cowboy Rib Eye with Bone Marrow and Roasted Garlic *8 OZ Filet Mignon  *Sauteed Dover Sole *French Fries *Bottle of Meiomi Pinot Noir Complimentary popovers, charcuterie board, Duck Liver Pate and another dish that tasted like pizza. All were good and thank you for these tasters.  Our waters were never filled. I had to ask a few times.   Next, we ordered a bottle of wine and our food. He then says, they were out of Wagyu and something else. Which is fine. We ordered the 2 lb lobster and a couple of steaks. He then returned and told us they ran out of lobster so we needed to pick another dish which we did.  In addition to our order my friend asked for blue cheese for his steak.  The food was then delivered and NO Blue Cheese given.  He asked the server again which he responded with give me a minute and when he brought it, it was damn dressing. Errr, we had to ask someone else to get blue cheese. Finally,  the blue cheese crumble was given.    As far as the food, the Ahi was delicious. I would not recommend the bacon. That was extremely salty and I love salt. At least the chimichurri offset the salty taste.  The filet was cooked perfectly to my liking. Now, I ordered the Rib Eye Medium temperature.  The steak was medium rare. The server never came by to ask how we were doing and if the food was to our liking. So since I couldn't locate him,  i asked a female who was next to our table and luckily she was one of the managers on the floor. She apologized and said yes it was medium rare and would give us a complimentary dessert and champagne.  Nothing was delivered to us so whatever.  The server did not apologize at all for the incorrect cooking of the steak. We finally got our steak back and now the outside of the steak was burnt instead of nicely charred.  What a waste in my opinion.    Overall, my experience was a very negative one. I will no longer recommend BLT.  Now I know why BLT had available reservations and Nobu and Gordon Ramsey were fully committed.  This place really went downhill.",

All the different salads were great but I'm so glad I shared mine. The Dover was good but for $70 their wasn't much. Since it is a steak house I will definitely order the steak next time.   The biggest reason I like the BLT is the buttered popovers (they even give you the recipe). I could make a meal of it.  Desserts are divine. Let's go back soon!",

The sides are sides. You should not  mess the sides up but their mac & cheese was the worst I've ever tasted. Nothing but salty bites. Pasta was cooked perfectly but the sauce was just wrong. Maybe it was my mistake for ordering it. Should have stuck to veggies. The chopped salad was cold and refreshing but wasn't a big fan of the dressing either which was also on a saltier side. Baked potato was huge and comes with the condiments (sour cream, butter, shredded cheddar, & smoked bacon). The filet mignon was cooked to the temperature requested and the quality was very good. The Porter House Cut though, was so disappointing. Porter house or T-bone steak if you will, has to be the king of their cuts. I was expecting a very good tasting cut of meat. The appearance was good with the roasted garlic on the big cast iron plate. The done-ness wasn't our desired temp though. The temperature was all over the place. Some parts done right, some parts were so over and some parts were rare. Chewy and rubbery mess. The herbed butter couldn't help to make the meat taste better either. Let's just say, our pup even refused to eat the left overs we brought back from here. The meat was overall not so satisfactory but we decided not to mention it (more like why bother). With the rave reviews, maybe my expectation was set too high.  Service was good, friendly & attentive.  Well, there are endless steak dinner options in Vegas. Off to search for another place! **the check in offer is actually buy one get one free offer!",

Our waiter was professional and friendly. Though, his demeanor did change when alcoholic beverages were not initially ordered. Interesting that he lit up like a Christmas tree when we later opted for wine.  The steak offerings here a huge. The New York strip is 20 Oz. The Ribeye, 22oz. And, the filet - 10oz. We opted to share the 22oz \"Cowboy\" bone in ribeye. The presentation was very nice. However, sadly, it was tough and rubbery. We sent it back. Our server gave us complimentary rounds of wine and beer as a way to make amends. That was nice. Second time around, the steak we ordered to be medium well came back as medium-it was primapink, but we didn't want to complain. The steak was good, but there are much better steakhouses in Vegas. For now, Golden Stein and Circus Circus still reign supreme...at least, for me.  I won't return.",

The green beans were a good compliment and the starter lobster salad excelled. It was enough for the both of us unlike the salad at Gordon's (still mad about that) Anyways the salad was tasteful, but I must add that it was a bit too salty.

    "text": "I don't think I would have dined at this place if it wasn't for my hotel room key, I must say, it was a great find.   I was staying at Bally's and was about to head out. I was searching everywhere for my room key and all I found was this ad with a picture of a popover. It took me a while to realize it's actually my room key and not some ad I received from the lobby at registration. It had been a while since my last time munching a popover. And I had a 20% off coupon from staying at Bally's. Why not?   So I went in for an early dinner. Over ordered for a party of 1 like always. I know I should have chosen a smaller cut, but I'm a sucker for ribeye. So here comes a 22oz bone-in ribeye seasoned with salt and pepper with a slab of herb butter. What I didn't expect was the bone marrow that came with my steak. I felt bad about eating so much meat, so I ordered brussel sprouts on the side to have a well balanced meal.   After I ordered, I was served with some crostini with duck liver pate spread. I love pate, but I was lowkey sad. I thought the ad on my room key was a lie. I came for popovers with a side of steak. Did they changed it out for the pate? So here I'm trying to look extremely normal while being all upset inside. But the spread was pretty good. I must say, it's not enough crostini for that spread they give. On one hand, I wanted to save some room for my steak (knowing that I will take home at least half). On the other hand, I just wanted to eat the pate straight from the jar. As I was working on scooping more pate onto my crostini, MY POPOVER CAME!!!! The warm pastry that's extra soft inside with a hint of cheese is finally here, right in front of me, not just 2D on my room key. That's it, I'm gonna get full off of my pate and popover at a steakhouse. Done.  My steak and brussel sprouts came, my whole table was just packed with food. My eyes were definitely wider than my stomach. My steak was so crispy on the outside but so juicy and just right (had it medium rare). Just stick to the basics, I ordered a side of chimichurri sauce too, which was unnecessary. Sauce was good, but the steak alone was just flavorful. The brussel sprouts was the only disappointment that night. 99% of me thought it'd be fried. It came out just sauteed, soft textured, bit sour from the vinaigrette. Let's just say that I've had far better ones, even the ones I made at home tasted better than theirs. Maybe I should have gotten creamed spinach. Go fat or go home.   I had to take everything to go after like 3 bites. It wasn't because it didn't taste great, I just couldn't finish a piece of meat that's bigger than my face. But you bet that my 2 leftover meals (yes, it fed me 2 meals after) was pretty bomb. I'd come back for sure if I don't have any other meals planned (I'd be eating leftovers for a while).",

    "text": "This steak house is located inside Balleys. One of my favorite parts is the complementary duck liver, its just delicious! For our appetizer we got the East and West oysters which I will highly recommend. They are fresh and tasty. We also had the seafood platter for two which was good, but I would probably not order it again.   The service at this restaurant is great. The employees are very knowledgeable about their menu and make educated recommendations. We had the American Wagyu, the filet Mignon and new York steak. All of those steaks were perfectly cooked, tasty and tender. My favorite was the American Wagyu. For side dishes, I would recommend the mac and cheese or the truffle mash.   For dessert we have ordered the crepe souffle. At first it might look like an omelette but every bite was delicious. I love passion fruit so I was a big fan of the sauce. However, avoid this dessert if eggs are not your thing.",

The shrimp cocktail that I ordered came out timely and was delicious. Between courses my water glass was constantly filled with great service from the staff.   My main course was the Maine grilled lobster which was excellent. I ate it all with a loaded baked potato - very good. Chef sent out a comp dessert which put me over the top. I would eat here again for the lobster but I would likely try more steakhouses if craving beef. Overall it was an excellent high end dining experience.",

He was very busy (considering its Memorial Day weekend) but he worked his butt off at constantly checking up on us and answering any question we had. This was our first time to eat there and it was great! I had the filet mignon with the red wine sauce and my husband had the 24oz bone in ribeye with the blue cheese sauce. We also ordered the mashed potatoes and Mac 'n cheese as our sides. The Mac 'n cheese is awesome!!! I'm not a blue cheese fan but my husband said it was good but he liked my red wine sauce a little bit better. The popover rolls were incredible and I love that they give you the recipe! Last but not least, I had the Spirit Church Cocktail which was very yummy!!!! I didn't get a picture of our food but I got one of my drink which I will post. I wasn't sure if I would like it at first but it for sure exceeded my expectation! A+++",

The meal started off by our waiter bringing out a complimentary duck liver mousse which was very nice and of course the popovers which I found delightful. The popovers were light and airy and a great change of pace to the run of the mill bread baskets you tend to see. I shared a salad with my dining companion after that and then it was the steaks. I had the 32 ounce porterhouse and they had the filet. The porterhouse was right up there with the best steaks I've ever had, tender, juicy and full of flavor. The filet was equally tender, but lacked a little of the flavor of the porterhouse and while that might be enough for some to bump it to 4 stars, the quality service coupled with one of the handful of best steaks I've ever had is enough for me to give 5 stars.",

Fortunately the steak had no need for steak sauce.   Lobster was a bit on the mushy side but had good flavor. The popovers were good but I dont understand this \"OMG best bread ever!\" claims. The fries were very disappointing.  When you charge $10+ for sides they should be special and worthy of that price tag.  Envy's Parmesan truffle fries and Whiskey creamed corn come to mind immediately.  These fries were not special at all and I tasted stale cooking oil on them.   The service was good but the waiter was overbearing with his push to get us to order drinks, appetizers, desserts. Here is one such exchange we had: Waitor: what would you like to drink? Me: water is fine, thank you Waitor: are you sure, we have some nice cocktails Me: no thank you, Ive had enough alcohol already today Waitor: well we also have some nice non-alchoholic drinks Me: no thank you, I have not drunk enough water while I have been in Vegas",

I've been to all of them and I always order the filet. The filet at BLT is by far the best I have ever had. It was so tender and flavorful, I can't wait to go back to BLT at Bally's in Las Vegas. To start I had the bacon. I thought it was strange to order bacon for an appetizer but I did no wrong. It was like eating a steak but it was bacon!! It was so good and lean and tasty I wish I could get this bacon on a daily basis.  I might have a heartattack at some point if I did but I would die happy. Almost forgot.. As we sat down the waiter brought an amuse bouche which was a duck mousse pate with crackers. It was really nice but my highlight was the bread at the beginning. What a surprise! They call it \"poppers\". It was like eating a croissant but with a hint of cheese. I know when a restaurant is good and will be a great experience when the bread at the beginning is delicious. Let's just say everything else after the bread was just getting better. I don't know how but it did. I was so excited after ordering dessert (apple pie) I couldn't help calling a couple of people to tell them how amazing dinner at BLT was. When the bill arrived our server brought a small free dessert like a chocolate chip brownie bite. I tried one and even that was decadent.  The price at BLT might be a bit expensive (worth every penny) but you do get an little freebie at the beginning and at the end. And that makes up for the price difference between this steakhouse and all the rest not to forget to mention again the quality and flavor in my opinion surpass all other steakhouses. Don't think about it twice... choose BLT, it is amazing food and great service with friendly staff.",

I had low expectations since Bally's is not my most favorite hotel in Vegas, it's become run down and squeezed out by surrounding construction. I remember when it first opened as The MGM Grand and, at the time, was the finest hotel on the strip. My meal, service and surroundings were sensational. It was very expensive but I never mind paying for a great experience. Loved it.",

We came into the restaurant at 8pm and the food came out around 9:20pm. By the time we left, it was about 9:40pm. I am not sure if this is the norm at this restaurant but we literally spent almost two hours for a dinner. Honestly, I don't think it was the food preparation time that took so long. It seemed like the waiter was just not paying attention to our table for some reason. I consistently hinted my frustration of waiting at the waiter. He seemed to have noticed it, yet it did not do anything to help the situation.",

The steak takes at least 40 to 45 minutes which I understand was part of the wait. We waited for our  menu and our server, had to ask for refill of our water. We hardly saw our server except for when he took our order and brought our food.  He was quick getting me ketchup when asked though but overall service was horrible.   We got the NY steak - medium well, which was salty.  Got two filet mignon - medium well but it came medium rare and well done.  The steak wasn't bad and was really great and tasted amazing even though it wasn't cooked the way we preferred it. The salmon was cooked just right and it was good. Recommend that. Our side items consists of French fries and came with a mayo type sauce which we didn't prefer, just asked the server for ketchup; the French fries weren't that great either, it tasted like the oil they cooked it in and the it'll needed to be changed. We also got the stuff mushroom, didn't prefer that either. We also got the Mac and cheese which I recommend, very cheesy and got a little crunch to it and also the truffle mashed was very good and recommend!     I'm giving them 1 star for the horrible service but a 4 star for the food.",

    "text": "This was just an ok experience. For the money, it was a disappointment and should have been much better. We gave out group of 6, 2 hours and 15 minutes to dine before we had to see a show. The restaurant was less than half full when we arrived and we were seated promptly. Everything started nice and our server made some suggestions on food and drinks. Our wine was excellent and everyone enjoyed their drinks. We started with the crab cake appetizer. It was very mussy and not crisp on the outside like it should have been. As soon as you touched it, it fell apart. Not the end of the world, but was hoping for better. The pop overs they serve are perfect. Wedge salad: Average at best with very little dressing or blue cheese. I don't like a lot of dressing on my salad, but this was about a tablespoon for a fairly large salad. Average. Still at this point while we were not wow'd, it wasn't terrible. This is where things stopped. Our server stopped coming over and we noticed several other tables had their dinners. It got to the point that we had to flag down a waiter and ask to have someone talk to us. A manager finally came over and we asked what happened to our food. He apologized and said he would check on it. By the time it came, we were now in a hurry to finish eating and go right to the show (luckily in the same hotel). When they brought our food they indicated it was our fault since one of our diners had requested a well done filet. I would never eat a steak this way, but I have reluctantly cooked them this way for friends. I do the same as BLT, butterfly them. They said it takes them 40-45 minutes to cook a 10 oz. butterflied filet. Really, in a 1500 degree oven you brag about? I guess I need to show them how to cook a steak. The steaks were all perfect once we finally got them. Tried a filet and rib-eye (both medium rare) and no complaints what so ever. The meat was 5 star. The manager offered to buy us desert on him, but at this point we just had time to run to the show. When we are spending over $100 per person for a meal, I expect something special. This was not any where near what I have experienced at similar restaurants.",

Our dinner reservation was at 5:30 pretty early. By 6:30 it was SO LOUD around us my son could not hear me speak. We gave up on all conversation. Service was not great. The food quality was very poor. My filet mignon and my son's bone in rib eye were cold when served. My steak was tough to cut. My baked potato was cold and had the texture of having been cooked in a microwave not an oven. My fully loaded toppings did not melt into my baked potato.  The tuna and steak tartare were good as well as the creamed spinach. The stuffed mushrooms and popovers were ok. Both seemed to be over cooked.  To top it off I had asked for a birthday acknowledgement; the waiter didn't bring anything until I asked for desert and then he said he took the desert off my bill. Really I didn't want singing or anything like that but may a candle in the desert.  I'm not usually very critical but the BLT steak restaurant in Bally's LV missed the mark on so many levels.",

The overall experience was EXCELLENT! We had a terrific waiter (can't remember his name). We started with cocktails (two Vodka Gimlets)  which were FANTASTIC! Next they bought some starters (pate, etc.) on the house which were a nice touch. We had two salads - the Spinach Salad and the Beet Salad. Both were Excellent (my wife said she had never seen so many Beets in a Beet Salad - she loves Beets, I hate them). Next we shared the Bone-In Rib-Eye. It was huge and the Chef sliced it for us before presenting it. PERFECT! Medium to Medium-Rare! For sides we had sauteed spinach (not on the menu but they can do it) and the Stuffed Mushrooms (they were fine but we were stuffed already so those we didn't finished). During the meal we had a 2014 Pride Vineyards Cabernet (less pricey then Groth and twice as good!). We did not order a dessert. Overall - EXCELLENT!",

The good news, the steak was cooked great, we had a bone-in rib eye with the bone marrow (which didn't really taste like anything). The main course didn't seem to be the \"bell of the ball\" it was more of the side dish compared to the Chef's specials that came out as appetizers. The duck liver was good and the pop-overs were great! The truffle mash was extremly salty and the mushrooms were salty and looked like a pile of mush. Anyways, we probably won't be back as we frequent las vegas. I told the waitress about the salty food and that she said they enjoy getting feedback, but I was really saying it was un-edible, I was just being nice.",

Servers were very attentive throughout making sure we had everything we needed and offered suggestions that always hit the mark. Started with a duck liver pate thing and it was phenomenal. As you will probably read over an over again in other reviews the popovers are easily one of my favorite uses of bread ever, they are light and rich and have great eggy goodness perfectly complemented with the sweet cream and sea salt. My buddies had the special steak with truffle butter and I had the bone-in Ribeye. All three steaks were perfectly cooked and had incredible flavor. On a whim I ordered the blue cheese sauce on the side because it sounded good, but the steak was so tasty I didn't really use it. It seemed like a waste to cover up that great steak flavor with a sauce that wasn't necessary. Overall an excellent meal and I will definitely be returning.",

Definitely be sure to join the Total Rewards program (which several of the Las Vegas casinos are a part of, and is free to join) because you get a discount on many food items if you are a member. Service here was excellent. Very friendly server who was able to answer any questions we had about the food and explained how the steaks are dry aged and cut. Had oysters as a starter which were very good. They serve the oysters as a 50/50 split of East Coast and West Coast oysters, and are served as expected on ice with the typical accompaniments like lemon and horseradish. They do popovers here for bread, which were good. The chef also sent out a duck liver pate with crostini which was very good. For steak, I went with a medium-rare filet mignon. The steaks are thick here. They get a nice sear on the outside and the meat remains juicy and flavorful on the inside. They do put a small piece of seasoned butter on top when serving, too. This was one of the best filet mignons I have had. Side items here are done a la carte and are adequate to serve two people. There was a crab macaroni and cheese dish that was a special, and it was very good. The one slight disappointment here was on the glass of Malbec that I ordered, which fell short of expectations but was still a good wine.",

To be honest, the food here is quite good. The steak was perfectly prepared, seared just as it should have been and wonderfully seasoned. My wife's roast chicken was also delicious. The problem is that when I go to a restaurant, I want a meal. But every item here is served a la carte  and a la expensive! For my $56, I got a slab of meat. My iced tea was $4.50. and side dishes like green beans or rice or mashed potatoes were $11 each. Salads were even higher priced, but I did not order one, so I do not know how large they are or if they are a good value for the money. Again, the food WAS delicious, but when I want a slab of meat, I go to the butcher, When I go to a restaurant, I want a meal. And $4.50 for iced tea is a little hard to understand.",

The bread service was a wonderful cheese filled pop over and was really good. A helpful tip, they have 30 percent discount deals right outside the main entrance of ballys at the tix 4 less booth. Go to this place. Just as good as every other steakhouse on the strip and better prices",

    "text": "I'll start by saying I booked a stay at Ballys for a work conference and was not very impressed with the hotel itself. My room was a little rough around the edges so I was skeptical of their restaurants..  But I was wrong!  BLT Steakhouse was delicious!  I sat at the bar and had a delicious, fast lunch between meetings and it was the perfect break.   I don't even eat steak, and I can't wait to go back. I ordered the Lobster Cobb Salad (without the bacon) and it may have been one of the best salads I've ever eaten. I hope this is a staple menu item because next time I'm in Vegas I will definitely be ordering it. The salad came with a delicious bread pop-over compliments of the kitchen with some home-churned butter and sea salt. It was also fantastic and they even send you home with a copy of the recipe!  I'm looking forward to making them for the holidays.   I had a glass of wine, and it happened to be Happy Hour so it was very reasonably priced.   All in all, the staff was friendly, the food was delicious (seriously- can they deliver that salad to LA?!) and the service was quick and efficient. It was perfect for my lunch break and I will for sure be back soon.",

The short ribs looked like they came off of a dinosaur. The flavor was unbelievable.  Best ive ever had. I also suggest the prime rib. After trying it there, nowhere else can compare. Great experience! Our waiter was Jaun. He was great. Couldnt ask for better. His suggestions definitely put us in the right direction. Great experience.

Not sure if this was a fluke but everything from the server to the manager to the steak and sides were horrible!  For a $55+ dollar steak, you expect it to be cooked well.  Word to the wise, if you want a medium well steak tell them medium, for a medium steak tell them medium rare.  Someone in my party made the mistake of telling them medium and was brought out a well done steak...no pink and WAY overlooked. Also don't bother getting the $60 bone-in rib eye...the cut of the meat was awful!  It was way too chewy.  They seriously need to fire their butcher...or the chef that doesn't know how to cook steak at a steakhouse.  Also if you want chargrilled, inedible mushrooms then BLT is your place!  We expressed to the manager our concerns and promptly (15 minutes later) they brought out another bowl of inedible mushrooms.  We didn't see the manager again until the very end...never came back to check on us which is odd since he knew we weren't pleased with our meals. I'd almost give him a pass, but the restaurant was not even half full.  There are so many good restaurants in this town that I'm sure BLT won't survive with their subpar food and service.",

Cooked to perfection, and is worth the $95. I'll be back but would skip the seafood platter. Oh - not sure if it's part of how the severs were trained, but my server was extremely pushy which took me by surprise, since I'm at the restaurant and not at a car dealership.

You get a good amount of gratis stuff too. Included was a little dish of beef pate w/ some jelly, and two really big popovers that were super-delicious. But as others have said, don't fill up on the appetizers, because the steaks are big, and the sides are shareable.  Only reason it wasn't a 5 was because the server dropped the ball a bit at the end. We had coffee for dessert, he took our order, but forgot it. And when the coffee finally came the sugar packets were all soaked through - someone must have spilled water on them and no one caught it. But overall, good service as well.",

We ordered the porterhouse and was overdone.  And the popovers?  Good, but  weren't as fresh as we've experienced at the other locations.  No complaints about the sides.  Was debating whether to give 2 or 3 stars, but given the price and how the other BLT compares (at least DC and NY), I definitely thought it was more \"Meh, I've experienced better\" than \"A-OK.\"",

    "text": "My colleague and I were staying at the Paris Hotel over the week of March Madness. After watching some of the tournament games at the Ballys sports book we met up with his brother, walked by BLT, and decided to stop in for dinner before going out.  Dinner started with the complimentary duck liver spread and popovers, which I thought were both terrific. I then ordered their asparagus cream soup which I was told was somewhere between a cup and a bowl, our table ordered a few appetizers: onion rings, mashed potatoes, creamed spinach, and for my main meal I ordered a chicken dish. My colleague ordered a different chicken dish and his brother ordered fish.  The soup came out and it was nowhere near a cup and much bigger than a bowl...too much in my opinion but OK, I appreciate the large portions and I can always stop. The soup was good. It had good flavor but was not as creamy as I would have expected.  Next came the main course and appetizers. First the appetizers: the onion rings were  a soggy, oil saturated disaster. I could only eat one before my body begged me to think twice before continuing lest I end up collapsed in a gutter on the strip in dire need of a triple bypass. The Mashed potatoes and spinach were good but when I tell you the portions were small I am not kidding. The size of a Gerber baby food jar and that is not an exaggeration. I'm an average sized guy, 5'10\" 160lb, and there was no way I was leaving that place satisfied even if I ate everything on the table.  Next came the chicken. The first thing I thought when I saw the portion size was, \"how nice of them, they sent out some complimentary chicken wings.\" Wrong...that was my dinner. There were two pathetic pieces of chicken sitting in a cast iron baking dish. One wing and one leg. Size-wise these would not have made the cut at Hooters. Both had a nice char on the outside and looked OK so I dug in.   Well, it is a very good thing the waitress gave me a heavy, serrated steak knife to cut into them because otherwise I would not have stood a chance. It only took one reluctant bite before I had to call it quits. I had ordered chicken and they obviously made a mistake and served me the Petrified Chicken Jerky that I did not remember seeing on the menu. Waitress please!  This is where a \"two-star\" meal becomes a \"get-me-the-hell-out-of-here\" star meal and easily the worst dining experience I have ever had in Las Vegas. After explaining to our waitress that there was no way I could eat this meal and showing her how badly over-cooked and inedible it was she apologized and told me she would speak with the manager. A few minutes later she came back and informed me that they would be taking 10% off our check and also taking off the one drink my colleagues brother ordered. I told her that I ate 0% of my entree so it would stand to reason that I should pay for 0% of the entree. My colleague's brother also could not eat his fish because it was rife with bones. Regardless, 10% and that was that. Supposedly there was nothing she could do about that. The order must have come down from great Caeser himself.  Whatever. Since cost was not something we were going to haggle over we just paid our bill and left. On our way out we ran into the manager and he causally asked, \"so gentlemen, how was your meal?\" Well we let him know. It was obvious that he had no idea what had happened and was beside himself and very apologetic. I'm not sure how I felt about that since the waitress claimed that she spoke to the manager (maybe a different manager). Either way there was an obvious disconnect between the waitress, management, and the kitchen. That's a \"high-level\" red flag for me and tells me the place is poorly run.  Now I used to manage a fairly large restaurant myself and I fully understand and expect a kitchen to have an occasional off night. And every once in a while I also expect that I will catch a restaurant on an off night. It's OK, it happens. No need to go running off and writing nasty reviews on Yelp. This place is a steak house and I'm sure (at least I hope) that their steaks are better than their chicken and fish so I will not hang them completely on the food however unacceptable it was.  But, and this is a big one for me, when you are having a bad night and your guests are sending inedible food back to the kitchen you need to step up, accept responsibility and do your best to make it right. This did not happen in this situation and I'm not sure that it does in general at this establishment.  One thing about Vegas is that it is known for the quality of the dining experience. I've had mostly top-level experiences at every restaurant I've been to in Vegas. This was bad...really bad....from beginning to end. Easily below Vegas standards and I can almost guarantee you that any other restaurant you choose would be better.",

Shrimp Cocktail and the smoked bacon appetizer are a must have.  Caesar salad with garlic croutons are excellent.  As for the entree, the 28 day aged NY Strip was melt in your mouth...   As for staff, from the minute we arrived we were greeted by a friendly hostess and our server Juan and Manager KC made this event such a success.  Juan was a humorous and \"game on\" server and KC was able to demonstrate excellent management as she was able to oversee and make sure we were accommodated...   When in Vegas I will return ...",

We shared the tuna tartare as an appetizer and followed that with the bone-in ribeye. It was charred on the outside and cooked perfectly as well as very flavorful. It was served with bone marrow too! The tuna was ice cold and delicious. We tried the truffle mashed potatoes - fantastic! The Mac and cheese was good but a little salty. Everyone raves about the popovers for good reason. We were on our way to a show so didn't get to try dessert. We were glad we ended up seated at the bar as the restaurant itself seemed a little too dark. We agreed we will go back next time in Las Vegas. Compared to other steak houses on the strip, this was priced right and better than others. Hope you try it and enjoy!",

The prime new york on-the-bone tasted incredible and was cooked perfectly.  My girlfriend had a side of  mashed potatoes that tasted great.  Prices here were about half the celebrity sponsored steakhouses on the strip, but BLT serves wagyu and dry-aged prime beef like they mean it.  I was blown away.  The waiters were friendly and helpful with the wine selection.  They knew my girlfriend would prefer the Riesling despite her normal affinity for Rose.  She tried a sample of both and agreed.  And the pop overs!  Amazing!",

The start of the deliciously fulfilling popover-bread to the tomato minestrone soup with chops of savory sausage and some raw oysters began the dinner right. I ordered the \"surf n turf\" of a petite filet with my favorite scallops and my boyfriend ordered the 22oz ribeye oozing with juices and flavor. Our server, Omar M., was attentive and generous to offering us complimentary glasses of champagne and my chocolate tart with pistachio ice cream and cute brownie bites lit with two birthday candles. As for cocktails, order the Bees Knees, our server's choice of drink too, and the Old Cuban. We definitely recommend this place.",

He took it back,. Manager never showed up. Had to seek her after I paid for my wine.   Them the manager had the odacity to tell me that she took care of me by not charging me for the steak and baked potato ( which I didn't to get to try). I told her if she wanted to take care of me she would not charge me for the wine. She declined.

    "text": "Wow. Everything I had was delicious and worth every penny... dollar.   In town for friend's bachelor party weekend, while most of the time was buffets, and tourist spots. The best man, Arnold, decided on one night to have a formal celebration dinner for our friend.   The staff was friendly, very informative, and made us feel welcomed. The gruyere popover breads were oven fresh, and tasty. A bread with a nice crisp crust, and steaming soft center, perfect by itself or dollop of butter.  We asked for more.  All our sides were great, and we shared the likes of mushroom caps, and creamed spinach.  I ended up choosing the truffle mashed potatoes, which are runnier than the average person is use to. This is not your KFC potatoes. This was flavorful. The grilled asparagus was lightly seasoned, but done well.  Most of the guys opted for the usual big cuts of steaks like the 22 oz rib eye, and the porterhouse which were all very good.  I've had fine dining, and great meals all over the world, yet some how never had waygu/kobe beef before, which happen to be on the menu. A little on the pricey side, in comparison to the other cuts, but hey, you only live once. For about $50, I got 12 oz of pure heaven. To be fair the guys made fun of me as I had the smallest cut of meat of everyone. I told them I would give them a small piece, but then they'd each owe me $5 if it wasn't the best steak they've had. Easiest money ever! The steak was properly cooked, seasoned with salt, pepper, and served with a dab of butter. It practically melted with each bite.   I don't remember most of the rest of the weekend. This dinner is an exemption of what happens in Vegas stays in Vegas.",

Kudos to the Chief!  They did an amazing job!   I can't praise enough about the servers, they were are all amazing.  From the beginning to the end.  Uncomfortable: The restaurant manager came by our table to see if everything was ok.  I couldn't help but to stare at what was oblivious, her tatas!  Which was leaning over half of our table.  I felt so uncomfortable, and knowing that she asked a question waiting for a response.  My husband kind of stop what he was doing and just stared down.  I don't know if this was done intentionally or just her manners, it's really bothering.  I had no choice to answer avoiding eye contacts.",

We were seated and our server, Leon greets our table, confirms the Travel Zoo, then says don't concern yourselves with the restrictions just order whatever you'd like and the TZ certificate will apply! That was a great way to start our dining experience for sure!   We all started with cocktails, 2 martinis, a Jameson rocks & for me a Manhattan....... Mine was EXCELLENT SERVED ICEY COLD W/ a splash of cherry juice = PERFECTION!!! The Toni's came with Blue Cheese olives always a nice touch.     The filet (10 oz) the smallest available unless you want Kobe.... Just DEEELISSH, cooked medium was tasty not over seasoned you know seared on the outside and beautiful pinkish red on the inside.       A nice change of pace are the Humongous muffins they serve before dinner instead of bread ~ these things are served hot out of the oven & are FAB!! We ordered traditional sides loaded baked potatoes, green beans & asparagus ~ all were prepared al Dente except the potatoes & with a touch of butter.      Couldn't have asked for a better steak meal ~ NOT one misstep, HIGHLY RECOMMEND you check out BLT inside Bally's you will be happy you did!",

It was the right choice! Lightly seasoned with salt and pepper and that is all it needed! All of us got the same thing and all agreed that is how a filet should taste.  --Side Dishes - we got truffle mash, mushrooms, and Brussel Sprouts.

The porterhouse was cooked perfectly and tasted great! The green beans had lemon zest, parsley, and garlic and was extremely flavorful.  Our server was also very attentive and kept our water glasses filled to the brim.  BLT stands out from other steakhouses because of the 3 complimentary items they gave. They started off with a duck liver crostini, then their bread that wasn't any normal bread, but a gruyere baked bread that looked like a muffin. Then at the end they gave 2 mini brownie bites that were delicious!   I also used a groupon,  so I received $31 off my meal over $100.  I will definitely return! This was one of the best steakhouses I've ever tried and it was unbelievable that it was located inside Ballys!",

I've been to all the top steak houses around: Ruth's Chris, Cap Grill, Morton's, Del Friscos, etc. and BLT Steak tops them all! We started with salads: the caesar and the spinach with warm bacon dressing; both were amazing and we couldn't decide which was better. The martinis we sipped on had the most rockstar buttery blue cheese stuffed olives in them. The New York strip was cooked perfectly and melted in  my mouth! The side we chose was Mac and cheese, which was gooey, rich, and absolutely heavenly! The stuffed mushrooms side dish was ok, a little dry and too earthy tasting in my opinion. I also want to give big props to the waitstaff, especially our waiter Sergio. He's been with the restaurant for decades and was spot-on with menu recommendations, as well as entertaining with his stories about favorite past celebrity guests and interesting Bally's history. Thanks again for a fabulous meal; in the future we'll always make BLT Steak a part of our Vegas visits!!",

I got the Wagyu Burger and some onion rings.  The onion rings were good but under seasoned (basically no seasoning). The burger was cooked to the right temp (med rate) but again lacked seasoning, and the protein while having a great texture was over whelmed by the bread, onion lettuce, etc. The bacon wasn't crisp and went entirely unnoticed until a piece fell out. The burger basically disintegrated due the juiciness of the burger and moisture of the veg. I ended up eating it with a fork, but didn't finish either.  Really underwhelmed for a 40 dollar meal.",

    "text": "Having been to the BLT in Waikiki we decided to try this one out. There are many choices for steak in Vegas but I'm very loyal so I was excited to experience the same quality. Ordered scallops and a New York strip. They always surprise you with a little appetizer compliments of the chef. The puffy bread and the amazing butter is a BLT staple. I love a great crafted butter. The bread also came with a little card at the bottom with the recipe! Scallops were terrible. Tough, stringy, and full of grit. Not only weren't they cook long enough but they were not properly cleaned. Super disappointing. New York strip was super thick and cooked a perfect medium. The only issue was that the cook on the outside was severely charcoaled. I mean bitter crumbling charcoal in my teeth. I love a good char but burnt is not correct. I thought I was eating one of Uncle Tonys \"not paying attention steaks\" in the city park back in the 70's. I can tolerate the burnt pieces, but most customers won't. Carrot cake ginger ice cream dessert was  reasonably sized and really executed well. Ice cream is sooo unique. But I'm really saddened by the lack of attention to detail. Our server and the kitchen staff were very attentive and courteous as usual. I will have to think twice about returning to this one in Ballys. The price for this dinner didn't reflect the finished product, and with all of the other choices on the Strip you may want to choose wisely.",

    "text": "I'll tell you about my meal first, and add some additional context towards the end.  I dined at \"BLT\", located within Bally's, on the Las Vegas Strip, Labor Day weekend 2017. I ordered the Caesar Salad ($16.00), New York Steak ($58.00) and a Baked Potato ($12.00). For their complimentary bread service, I was provided a popover. (The restaurant's complete menu, with pricing, is available on their website.)  I am not a fan of \"Yorkshire Pudding\", but I now understand that a \"popover\" technically is a different product. (Yorkshire pudding incorporates beef drippings in the recipe, whereas popovers do not.) I found the popover to be very tasty, without the feature of pudding I dislike.   I can't say that the Caesar salad tasted any better than one you might order at lower priced restaurant. But the texture was different:  the leaves were more tender. Upon inspection of the lettuce leaves, I suspect they are using baby Romaine lettuce (versus fully grown Romaine).  I also enjoyed the presentation. (Hopefully, my photo attaches.) It was a nice salad.  I usually don't buy New York steaks at the grocery. I find the cut tougher than I prefer. However, the menu stated that BLT's New York steak was aged 28 days--and the aging really makes a difference. Because of the aging, the beef was tender, but firm enough for you to enjoy the sensation of chewing. The aging process also infused the meat with just a hint of gaminess. I asked that the steak be cooked medium rare, and what I received was \"perfect\" in my eyes:  it was seared on the outside; the interior of the steak was hotter than warm, yet the color was still red; and the juices ran clear. A pat of herb butter was placed atop the steak as well. Overall, the steak was rich, savory and flavorful.  The baked potato is not the largest potato that I have been served in a la carte setting; however, it could sufficiently serve two people.  My original plan was to dine at a steak restaurant within the Paris resort, before attending a show. However, there was a wait--which surprised me, given the time of day I visited. Not wanting to be late for my show, I went to BLT (where I found there was no wait).   So here's my bottom line:  BLT is not inexpensive. However, you will get a very good steak dinner, at a price less expensive than a restaurant affiliated with a marquee chef. And seating may be faster. Please don't misinterpret what I'm saying:  Sometimes you want the experience of eating at a restaurant tied to a celebrity chef; sometimes you just want the meal. My meal at BLT was very good.",

Based on reviews we thought this restaurant would be great. We were wrong. We expected to pay high prices and that everything would be a la cart. What we did not expect is that the quality of the food would be so low. I got a moscow mule to drink and it was horrible. Not made the correct way at all, you couldn't taste any ginger beer it tasted like sprite. When we ordered I got filet Mignon, medium rare. My friend got the braised short ribs, and my other friend got the rib eye There aren't many choices on the menu and all of the cuts of meat are huge.  My steak was cooked OK, but the center was cold, and it lacked seasoning. The short ribs were mostly fat. My friend was digging to find actual meat. Her plate was filled with grease when she was done. And she probably got about a cup and a half worth of meat in total. The rib eye was cooked OK, but lacked flavor. All of the meat lacked flavor honestly. Ruth Chris costs less and tastes better. Needless to say we were dissapointed. Our waiter didn't even ask us once how our meal was, or if we were doing OK so we could complain to him (ours had an eye patch). I would NEVER return here or recommend it to ANYONE. It's not at all worth the $80 each you will spend. Try somewhere else.",

When I asked if the potatoes were supposed to be cold the bar tender told me yes, but it was strange. Who serves fried cold potatoes? I don't think that's what Ramsey would have wanted served.

Host stand staff was very nice. One of the hostess walked us to a side waiting room where we probably waited only a couple of minutes until our table was ready. When we seated we were greeted by our waitress, Roxanne and another guy brought us some water. We ordered two glasses of wine and then we placed our appetizers order, a crab cake and a steak tartare. Right after we ordered, we were served a small plate with some bread. After I tasted I have to say that the bread was amazing, one of the best bread I've ever had in my life. It was baked with fresh gruyere cheese. Our appetizers were also delicious and very well presented. As entrees we ordered Sauteed Scottish Salmon and Grilled Ahi Tuna. Both dishes were cooked to perfection and very flavorful. For the salmon we choose a side of grilled asparagus and for the tuna we choose a side of stuffed mushrooms who were amazing. At the end we didn't have room for dessert but I'm sure their dessert choice was great too. Our waitress was very attentive and professional. She was also very informative and very knowledgeable about the menu and wine list. Great experience.",

    "text": "I actually ate here twice this week. Found it by accident on Monday night when I was just looking for someplace to grab a steak.  Had plans to take nine customers to dinner at another steakhouse on the strip the next night, but was told by coworkers that they had been there the night before and were not impressed.  So...... I switched our Tuesday reservation to BLT after enjoying a great steak on Monday night. We started out with \"Popovers\"  Most of the group had one, while I passed on the bread.  After looking at everyone else eating this stuff, I broke down and grabbed one.  I will say that it was an experience that I will never forget! :)  I next had a Caesar Salad which was huge.  Delicious and just the right amount of dressing, not over bearing.  I had the New York Strip (for the second night in a row), which was perfectly cooked medium rare along with some really crispy green beans.  I am a steak sauce kind of guy, but the melting butter on the top of the steak made my desire for A-1 (or the BLT sauce) completely unnecessary. Most of us ate steak, although one had the Sea Bass.  Everyone was impressed. If you are a wine drinker, you will love their wine list.  We drank plenty of red and white, enough to Impress Brenda and Eddie and Billy Joel.  The dinner staff at BLT was amazing.  I made sure to get all of their names because I was so impressed and didn't want to not acknowledge their awesomeness.  Our waiter, Mario and Busser, Jamie were constantly there to check on us and keep our glasses full.  It seemed like they always knew when we needed something and they timed it perfectly.  The Manager on duty, Char was gracious and went out of her way to make sure that we had everything we wanted (and we did), It seemed like a well oiled machine.  They make up a great team! Bottom line is, I love this place!  May even try to get over there again before I leave town.  I would highly recommend it!",

    "text": "We were at BLT for a belated 21st birthday celebration for my daughter and could not have asked for a better dinner!  Three of us had the 10 oz filet and one had the bone in strip, all with different levels of \"doneness.\"  Every single steak was cooked to perfection and so tender!  I am super picky about how my beef is prepared.  Recently graduated from well done to medium well, knowing that most chefs usually do a medium when preparing my order.  It was medium well, and we all were amazed at how simply flavorful it was.  There are several different choices for sauces.  We either ordered the red wine sauce or the peppercorn sauce.  I loved the peppercorn sauce.  Thought it wes the perfect compliment.  To start I had the butternut squash soup which was delicious.  The sommelier picked out a beautiful Malbec - a 2013 Luca.  She was awesome, and took her time answering questions and doing some teaching.  She was really sweet!  As everything is a la cart, we each ordered a different side: loaded baked potato, mac and cheese, potato skins, and green beans. Everyone was very happy wtth their choices.  We were too full for dessert, unfortuately. Let's talk about our waiter, ok?  Leon was freaking AMAZING!  He helped make the meal even better.  Attentive without being overbearing.  My best friend and 2 daughters were with me, and he put up with us in great form, joining in on our fun while we were still keeping it classy.  He bought my 2 daughters shots, the birthday girl a cute little dessert (tiny brownie bites) with a candle, and brought the 4 of us each a glass of champagne.  You would be so lucky to be seated in his section.  He truly looked like he was enjoying every minute of his job with all his tables.   All that being said, it was a very expensive dinner, so for us, it was an extravagance we couldn't do very often, but well worth it.  I would definitely come here again and would not change one single thing.  Welllllllll......we could've done without the second bottle of wine.  We ended up corking it and bringing it back to the hotel since we knew if we finished it, we would indeed be finished!",

My rib eye was perfectly cooked, very tasty. The truffle mashed potatoes the best I've had.  To top it off the bananna creme pie with a crushed pecan crust AMAZING!  The best part was our service was second to none!  Omar our server explained the menu in detail and he made us all feel like good friends.  Ask for his table when you go. He won't disappoint. Made our night a memorable one! All and all a great choice to dine. We will return!",

I wish I had more time....I had two appetizers, and one of the signature whiskey cocktails that I don't remember the name of but it was great.  The Fois is superb, topped with a cherry glace and served with crostini. It's simple perfection. The seafood sample platter was picked clean by myself and one other person. Everything on that platter was so fresh, they might as well have gone out and caught the array of shellfish and Crustaceans themselves. My only regret is not having enough time to stay for dinner. We'll meet again BLT Steak.",

    "text": "Was excited to try the heavily advertised BLT Steak while I was in Las Vegas and splurge on a great dinner.  I sat at the bar and ordered dinner.  After reviewing the menu I found the WAGYU ribeye to be quite tempting - even though it was $91.  I had a great WAGYU ribeye in Houston about a year ago and it was the best steak of my life.  I figured why not go for it - Wagyu is not in that many restaurants.  Of course I ordered the steak medium-rare because you don't want to overcook a Wagyu!  It came out in a nice presentation in a small cast-iron pan.  Immediately I noticed that this steak was very thin - probably about 3/4\" in thickness which alerted me that it would be easy to overcook.  Sure enough, when I cut into it the temperature was MEDIUM - one level beyond medium-rare.  I was ok with that but this piece of meat was not rich, succulent and full of great wagyu flavor which I expected.  It was completely underwhelming.  It was not tough but it was not 'butter-knife' tender like a great wagyu.  The steak was comparable in my judgement to a visit to a local Texas Roadhouse or Longhorn.    Overall, I don't mind paying the total check $125 (steak, one drink, one side of potatoes) but I expect this to really deliver FULL SATISFACTION.  I really would tell the management of BLT that they should consider removing this item from their menu as it is a complete liability.    Last note of interest:  I heard the bartender recommending to other customers his choice of steaks - he said he was a ribeye lover but did NOT recommend the Wagyu or Prime ribeyes but rather a bone-in New York strip.  That made me worried but I had already ordered.......",

My sister liked her crab cake. The seafood plateau was so so. Shrimp was great but crab was small, clams and oysters were not good, too soft. I could see our tray brought out and set down in a hallway with servers looking at a piece of paperSteak sucked. Highly doubt it was USDA Prime, was like a grocery store steak. Emeril's is USDA Prime. Steak was fatty, ordered medium rare but closer to medium. Didn't have a good char crust except for right by the bone. If it weren't for the voucher I'd be pretty pissed.",

Our server, Hugo was clearly a fine dining veteran. His attentiveness, knowledge of the menu and affable demeanor was first rate. The manager, Casey, checked on us several times and we wanted for nothing throughout our meal.  As for the meal itself, we enjoyed warm cheese popovers, oysters on the half shell, a well-executed tuna poke and charcuterie. My medium-rare porterhouse steak was seared, broiled and properly rested. Dessert was decent, but I didn't consider it to be on par with the rest of the excellent meal. Nevertheless, I was thoroughly sated at that point.  Overall, I would consider BLT Steak an under-recognized star in the Vegas dining constellation. Highly recommend.",

The food, even though it looks appetizing, it's not.   We raise quality Angus beef and know the difference.  They served a porterhouse, rather sizable (32 ounce), was disgusting.  Even then tenderloin was not tender.  The New York strip side was tough and not easy to cut even with a steak knife.  There were a total of six of us and there were at least six issues with the order.    Two out of six at the table had positive things to say about the steak they were served, filet mignon,  and rib eye.",

So, we did speak to the manager, Lawrence and ended up being pleased with the way he handled the situation. The server Leon, was great. He wasn't overly attentive with his good timing and had a good sense of humor. The food was delicious, we ordered seared scallops, Caesar salad, green beans, lobster mash, Mac and cheese, a steak, and lobster. Even the popovers were great!

    "text": "DO NOT DINE WITH BLT STEAK BALLYS LAS VEGAS!!!!    My husband and I celebrated our 5 year wedding anniversary at BLT Steak Ballys Las Vegas on Saturday, June 24, 2017. We purchased a $115 voucher from Travel Zoo; which was worth $210 dining credit. Our total after using the voucher plus taxes and gratuitywas $60. The next day we checked our bank and was charged two different amounts totaling $381.05. If you add this amount to how much we paid for the voucher, it cost us a grand total of $496.05 for dinner for two. We've contacted the restaurant twice and they claim to have only charged us $60. They're only willing to refund the $60 to us. They blame it on our bank and told us to dispute with our bank. This overcharge should have never happened. No customer should have to deal with this issue. Now I'm left with calling my bank, the restaurant and travel zoo to resolve this issue. There are plenty other restaurants in Las Vegas. Do not dine in with BLT Steak Ballys Las Vegas or you may get overcharged like us.",

We ordered the intimidating 36 oz porterhouse and lamb chops both medium rare. Unfortunately the porterhouse arrived blue rare while the lamb chops arrived rare. The sides were a joke. At $12 at other steakhouses, a side is usually pretty generous, but the stuffed mushrooms were tiny and only came with 5 and were honestly kind of gross. The truffle mashed potatoes had oil leaking from them, was overseasoned in a tiny cast iron pot, maybe half a cup of mash. If the sides were more generous and the meats cooked properly we would definitely have returned as the quality was there. Maybe it was an off night?",

The decor is dark and lightly lit creating a perfect date atmosphere.   I received ok service, not bad enough to knock a point off, but the waiter seemed uninterested especially since I didn't order wine. But I know service isn't the only thing.   I received a pop over that I didn't order, my guess for use in promotion. But it was a pleasant surprise. The bread melted in my mouth. I wanted more, but knowing my stomach, had to save some room. I even received the recipe on a card to take home.   I ordered the port wine braised riblets with a side of mac and cheese. The mac and cheese came in a skillet and used a white cheddar sauce. It was excellent. The riblets came out in a huge skillet pot filled with sauce and the hunk of meat in the middle. The meat just melted, I mean melted like chocolate on a 90 degree day,  in my mouth. It was seasoned perfectly and so tender.    After my amazing meal, I got to meet Hell's Kitchen winner and new Head Chef Ariel, only three days into her job. She seems truly confident in her work and team and after eating that meal, I told her to keep going forward because it was awesome.   The price is what you would expect from vegas. Entrees are in the 40-55 range. But the quality of food is worth every penny.  If you happen to be near Bally's and want a great dinner, I highly recommend BLT Steak.",

    "text": "This place was exceptional. I am knocking it down a star because it seemed that every wine we ordered was out f stock. Kind of a random occurrence because they had a really extensive list that could cater to anyone's taste. I do have to say that the General Manager apologized profusely each time he said they were out of a particular wine, but he did suggest another wine which was actually a great pairing to what we ordered and suited both of our tastes. Kudos for him for knowing his stuff! Also knocking down a star because once we were seated it took 10-15 minutes for our server to come over. Once he introduced himself, he was very helpful and friendly.   The amuse bouche was a pate... I don't remember what kind, but have you ever seen someone who doesn't eat meat break out a little redneck and try to lick the bowl clean? It was incredible. Wow. I want to get in the bowl of that deliciousness.   We had the tuna tartare for our appetizer. I always order this fan favorite if I see it on the menu and I was not disappointed in their take on this dish. Try this if you like tuna!  My other half had the NY Strip and ordered it medium rare. This restaurant nails it on the head for cooking their steaks perfectly! Although he claims that he wishes he ordered it rare instead, it was thoroughly enjoyed. I had a bite and found it a tad too salty, but what can you expect from an aged steak? And in my opinion he should have ordered the steak rare (or blue, yes they do that here yay!), it is his own dang fault.  I had the Grilled Branzino. Having never tried this before, I was intimidated. I don't know why. This meal completely surpassed my expectations. It was incredible. I was finished with my fish before he could finish his steak!  On the side we ordered the mac-n-cheese. Overall it was good, but I have to say it wasn't mixed well so a few bites were extremely salty. The truffle mashed potatoes were everything I hoped and dreamed. I would order both again and just make sure to stir thoroughly next time.  I don't know that I would return as there are so many other steak house options, but I would recommend.",

    "text": "Asked front desk at Bally's where to go for dinner he suggests BLT steak and tells us the chef was the last winner of Hell's Kitchen which we are fans of especially Gordon I love him he reminds me of my father that died recently .  We thought we were going to have a great experience.  It started off ok.  Our bartender wasn't the friendliest guy.  I asked what they had for reds and he turned around without a word grabbed a menu then slapped it in front of me.  So far weird but the signature BLT drink with the dried orange was so good and I thought things would get better when we got a table.  When they brought us to our table we passed by several very open areas scattered with people comfortably enjoying their meals.  We were sat against the wall next to the kitchen sandwiched between 4 other tables maybe 18 inches away from each other if we were lucky.  My husband told me next day that that actually put him in bad mood which is funny because I was also really bothered by that but I kept it to myself thinking it would get better.  It keeps getting worse.  Waitress Margo I Think was nice enough but she didn't care.  She didn't seem to care about anything nor have much knowledge about anything.  She kinda blew off each question I asked her like I asked if the tabouleh was really minty and she said oh no it's not minty at all and I felt like I had to inform her that traditionally it had mint in it it seemed to me like she played it off as if she already knew but I believe she was clueless because it was like ya ya I don't care uh huh how can I get out  of here.  It made me so uncomfortable that I started apologizing that I asked a couple questions.  Then my husband makes 3 attempts to be friendly and ask her how this or that is and she clearly didn't care and couldn't wait to get out of there.  I said to him each time she doesn't care.  He got mad at me because I kept saying that but he can't help himself to keep trying which is killing me to watch.  So he tries to tell her the pop overs aren't that great to me they are very eggie not very cheesy tasting at all they are like chocolate eclair without the chocolate.  She says ok and walks away.  Maybe she didn't hear him?  She acted like she did.  She spoke English as first language.  My husband did say there were so many people unnecessarily packed next to each other that he had trouble hearing me.  My husband suggested I get the scallops with tabouleh because it's a chalkboard special of night.  I got 2 and 1/2 scallops not really big but on small side of large with maybe 1/2 cup tabouleh.  Scallops were over cooked at least half of the deformed 1/2 scallop was and the tabouleh was just ok the lobster bisque was very tasty but by the time I got to the 2 pieces of lobster claw they were saltier than I would have expected, chewy and definitely over cooked.  The wedge salad was pretty average not something you would expect to come out of Hell's Kitchen.  1 bite of that salad and the waitresses attitude and I just wanted to leave.  She makes mistake of dropping off the 2.6 scallops for the special price of $45 and asks me how things are as I am staring at my plate in Complete disbelief.  Had she been nice and engaged or acted like she cared I might not have been so upset but I pretty much lost it on her and told her that she ruined our night with her attitude and on top of that I said are you serious?  If  had known it was $50 for 2 scallops I never would have ordered it,  if you want to start your night off on the wrong foot and pay lots for nothing then you need to go to this place.",

Dined here the first week in June with 7 friends,  I shared the 36 once Porter house with my wife. It was cooked A perfect medium rare with a tasty outer crust.  We all ordered different sides and entree's and no one was disappointed.     The lobster salad was to die for, so was the tuna tartar, and the peanut butter  mousse desert.     All my friends raved about their dishes. The new chef Ariel is winner of this years Hell's  Kitchen and it shows in her work. She is an artist. She came out, talked to us and showed us how passionate she is about her  Work. She is genuine and humble, and should be one of the next super star chefs in Vegas.    If you are in Vegas and want to experience The best dining in a city known for its cuisine  This is the place.",

Sit down, have a nice meal and be surrounded by good people. this was the definition of everything you could ever want. I went to BLT for brunch on Sunday prior to the Superbowl. Everything was on point. Starting with the hostess Char finding us a great table. All the way to the the waiter Sergio making sure our drinks stayed topped off. Then to top it off a very sincere Farwell from the Manager Warren and the hostess Char giving my Lady a rose as we departed. The experience was awesome. Lobster tails, Crab legs, waffles, salmon, bacon, and even the dessert buffet were all fantastic. I will be back.",

    "text": "Excellent food and service.  We aren't usually fine diners (see other reviews) but once in a while you have to splurge.  I received an offer from Travelzoo and checked with the restaurant to verify which offer to get so that we could apply it to the following:  22 oz USDA prime rib eye steak  2 lb maine lobster  sides of truffle mashed potatoes, creamed spinach, and mushrooms 2 glasses of wine, one riesling and one cabernet  Included the tastings of foie gras and popovers.  Everything was sublime.  Steak and lobster were both cooked properly and were served in the cast iron pans in which they presumably were cooked.  We were celebrating the Mrs. birthday and they surprised us with prosecco aperitifs on the house.  I'm sure the desserts are fabulous but we couldn't eat another bite after that orgy of decadence so we declined a dessert.  However our waitress did bring us 2 bites of brownie which were indeed something special.  Importantly, the staff seemed knowledgeable about the Travelzoo offer.  They have several offers and they told me which one to buy to ensure we could get the lobster.  Which I did.  Total for the above was about $230 including tax but not tip, and was way more rich food than we could deal with. I ate way more than is sensible, and we could easily have shared with another person or maybe two (although I don't think that would be within the constraints of the offer).  The eligible offer gave me $208 in credit for a pre-paid purchase price of $118 for 2 diners.  Not bad at all.    The room is also really nice, comfortable, and elegant, without being stuffy or unnecessarily high-concept.    In summary, this was an excellent restaurant that I would gladly eat at again without a coupon if I were in the market for a big splurge, which doesn't happen very often.  Or, if you are paying.",

The strip was even more flavorful and was bone in. Marbelized amazingly as well as perfect amount of fat. Served like never served before.  Enough about the steak,bread was something we have never had and was great as well. BLT steak...you have out done yourselves! See you next time",

    "text": "I have to say that this place was absolutely phenomenal! I would go back there in a heartbeat. I'm posting this a little late; my husband and I went there for dinner about 1 month ago at the end of July. This was our honeymoon and I am so happy that we got to experience this restaurant.  Firstly, the hostess was very very sweet and asked us if we were celebrating anything special. I said that it was our honeymoon and they treated us like gold. They seem to be very nice accommodating and customer friendly anyway so I have no doubt that they would have True that's just the same had it not been a special occasion.  The restaurant was very clean and decorated in a very modern and contemporary atmosphere. Our waiter was fabulous, explaining everything on the menu, going over all of the specials in cocktails explaining everything in detail. He was wonderful!   Everything we ordered was awesome. To start, we got complimentary duck pate, which I've never had before but it was really good! After this course, they provided complimentary cheese popovers, which were again amazing. They also provided small recipe cards so you can make the pop overs at home if you wish. I thought this was a very nice touch and very classy. My husband and I shared the Porterhouse  for two, got a few sides, and also three dipping sauces to try. Again everything was delicious!  We picked everything clean!  Additionally, the cocktails were very good. My only criticism is that each cocktail was $14 each which, I know is Vegas, but still, a little expensive.  Naturally, we had to splurge on dessert and we weren't disappointed. So rich and delicious, each I believe were only $10, which seemed like a steal compared to everything else, haha.   Howeve, my favorite part throughout the whole experience was watching the staff members throughout the evening. There seem to be multiple managers walking around, checking on customers, in addition to the incredibly efficient wait staff. I was very impressed that multiple folks came by to ask us how our meal was, how experience was, and knew that it was our honeymoon and congratulated us.  It made us feel really special and made the experience very personalized.  They also gave us a complimentary dessert which were too small chocolate bites because they knew it was our honeymoon and my husband's birthday was the day before. It was cute, small, and had a lit candle in it which was very nice.  We absolutely loved it and I wish that there was one near off in Boston! It would probably make us go broke!",

We had Hugo who has worked there since the beginning and provided great service and recommendations.  To start, we got amazing bread and butter and duck liver pate.  Not sure what it was actually called but was very smooth and tasty.  Cocktails were also great, had two old Cubans and mojitos.  They were strong and the different flavored stood out.  For our entree each couple shared their signature steak - a rib eye on a cast iron with garlic, butter, and thyme.  We also shared the lobster and a few sides.  Presentation was great, the only reason this place doesn't get the 5th star is because the steak was flavorful but was slightly tough and not as marbled as I would have hoped.  Still a darn good steak but I expected (and hoped) it would be perfect.  The only other reason is that it did not seem like a 2lb lobster.  There was not enough meat in it at all - each of us had one good bite and it was gone.  Overall a great 4-star experience.  Would probably try other steak houses next time I'm in Vegas!",

The popovers were one of the the best breads I've ever been served. Loved the little mini dessert bite included at the end of the meal also. The steak wasn't hot though and the waiter never asked if the steak was ok. He didn't even ask if it was cooked as ordered. I have never been to a fine dining restaurant where they didn't have you check it when they bring it out.  Just disappointed that our bus boy was actually more friendly and personable  and helpful than our waiter. We had better service at buffets. It felt strange as he was very attentive to another group who had alcohol flowing by us and we chose not to drink with our meal. At a place like this you shouldn't need to flag someone down for drink refills, etc. Sadly for him we always tip huge, tonight he got 15% an abnormal for us as we never tip less than 20...often more. I have to emphasize again however, that the food here was fabulous just expect a little more attentiveness and personable service at a $200 meal. I have had better service at much more inexpensive places.",

The macaroni and cheese was nothing special... They did not even bring any salt or pepper to my table and I had to eat my steak before it got cold so I ate it without any salt or pepper... I would not recommend this place at all nor would I spend my money here ever again... Stay away from the crepe souffle which was cold and soggy with passion fruit sauce which did not go together at all... Also avoid the crab cakes at all costs... The worst crab cakes I've ever tasted anywhere.  Nothing worse then wanting to have a good dinner and having terrible food and having to pay a high price to be disappointed.  The only thing I would ever go back for was the banana pie which was phenomenal... Ironically it's not even on their menu.  It had pecan crust caramel and caramelized banana it was the best thing on the menu hands down.  However I did not make reservations and wait all day to eat a banana slice of pie I really wanted a good steak... And it was burnt blacker than black to a crisp!!!  I should have went with my gut feeling and went to Lawry's instead!",

It's got the mood lighting inside, and small tables mixed with large ones. We were seated next to a boisterous group celebrating a birthday which was a little bit loud; I wish they requested a private room to take them off the main dining room. There's a check in for a free drink but you have to buy one first to take advantage of it. I had this good house special bourbon cocktail, and after a big meal, couldn't fit in the check-in deal. We ordered the Caesar salad (salty, but not overly salty), complimentary turnovers (these were good, but I would have preferred actual bread and butter instead), and two steaks that they kindly sliced for us upon request: the porterhouse (very good, very little fat) and the cowboy ribeye (too much fat, but that's what you get on a ribeye I guess). Our sides were creamed spinach, mashed potatoes, and brussel sprouts--I liked the spinach the best. Not too creamy or runny. The waiter was attentive and you never had to wait long for the water glass re-up. No room for dessert. Not sure if I'd rush back with the abundance of other steakhouses on the Strip, but this was still a good one for a Saturday night dinner.",

    "text": "My boyfriend and I have been here many times and this is our favorite steakhouse in Vegas. We try to eat here everytime we go to Vegas if possible.   Most recently, we went to Vegas to celebrate our anniversary and of course, this was the place to go. The prices are on par with other steakhouses, however, for the sides, they ARE small portions, so the sides are much more expensive than other places... but we rarely finish everything because they give you quite a few things in between.   For those who like to saw a few bucks. They usually offer a Travel Zoo deal. That is how we initially discovered this place and we've been coming back since. The Travel Zoo is an amazing deal! You get over $200 worth of food for only $100... but my boyfriend and I always go crazy and we typically end up about $100 over... but it's all worth it! Don't be afraid to buy the Travel Zoo deal. It says 2 drinks, 2 apps, 2 entrees, etc for the deal. However, in reality, you can order whatever you want. They will just take off the value of the voucher at the end of the meal.   We usually go for the bone in ribeye because it's sooo delicious! It's a huge cut and I personally never finish it! It's actually big enough to share, but my boyfriend loves the food here so much that he said that although we should share... he doesn't want to because he wants leftovers to eat again!   It's $60 for a giant cut of bone in ribeye and it's cooked perfectly to your liking. It also comes with bone marrow. Other cuts vary in price, but the most expensive is waygu for $90+. This time, we each ordered a ribeye, plus we ordered a 2lb lobster to share. We ordered the lobster tail before to add to the steak, but a 2 lbs whole main lobster is a better deal! It was delicious, tasty, and big! They crack the meat from the claw so everything is super easy to eat. It came with a cognac sauce. For our sides, we ordered the creamed spinach and mac n cheese. Usually we order creamed spinach and truffle mashed potatoes, but we wanted to try a little something different. All the sides are good though. However, out of those, I would say the truffle mashed potatoes were my favorite. We did also try a side of their special menu, the pork belly with grits. I would have to say that I was disappointed with this... the grits were good, and I'm not a fan of grits. They were shaped and fried into triangular blocks and deep fried. That took it to another level and with the tomato sauce and pieces on top, it was delicious! I ordered this dish for the pork belly. That's what sold me... however, there was only 3 tiny and I mean tiny pieces of pork belly on it!! This dish just was not worth it unfortunately. For dessert, we went with the banana cream pie to share. It was a big slice! It was not overly sweet and I really loved the pecan nut crust. I loved the crunch it added to the dish! The pie was very refreshing and seemed to clean out our palate well after our meal. Every time we have been here, they give you duck liver pate to start. I always look forward to that because it's so light and delicious!! You get a handful of crispy bread to spread it on. It's a great way to start the meal. Next comes the popovers, which is one of their specialties. You MUST try it, break it open, spread on some butter, and sprinkle a little bit of the salt they give you! It's heavenly!! I have to stop myself from eating them all before the meal comes out because they are that good!! To end your meal, they also give you some small dessert bites. We were given little brownie bits. They were soft and chewy. A perfect addition to out banana cream pie!! Since we were celebrating our anniversary this time, they also gave us 2 glasses of champagne on the house to celebrate!  We love this steakhouse not only for the food, but also for the excellent service!! It has also been consistently good and the waiter really talks and jokes around with you. We have always had 5 star service here from start to finish each time. To find this place, walk towards the back of Bally's. It's past the Buca De Bupo and SEA. You do not hear any of the distractions of the slot machines and the ambiance is relaxing.   We'll be back here again and again!! It's must on every Vegas trip now!!",

The food was spectacular and quite honestly some of the best we've had in a long time. We never would have ordered the duck pate but again on the suggestion of Omar we did and it was the best I've ever had. The service is wonderful and Jay was a delight too.

I had bought the travelzoo $210 voucher for $115. It is worth it! Our order consisted of beef tartar, crab cake, cowboy steak, NY strip, truffle mash potatoes, and Mac-n-cheese. The steak was cooked to perfection. I believe medium rare is where it's at for a good steak. The NY strip was just amazing. The cowboy steak was my favorite. It had more marbling than the other steaks on the menu. I personally like more marbling on my steaks. It was so good. My boyfriend was just in food heaven. He had the \"Guy Fieri\" face (if you know what I mean) with every bite. His favorite was the truffle mashed potatoes. You could tell they used actually truffle and not truffle oil because of the color and taste. The Mac-n-cheese was delicious. The steak tartare was just so amazing. It had a great texture and was seasoned beautifully. The crab cake had lemon tartar sauce that just elevated the crab cake.   The restaurant was beautiful. It made our anniversary dinner so special.   *side note* They gave us duck pate with baguette toast and it was so good. It set up great expectations for the appetizers and entrees. The bread popovers were so good and fresh. They also give your a little card with the recipe that I will definitely use!",

    "text": "Even before this place opened, my boyfriend and I looked forward to dining here one day. We figured our third year anniversary would be a great reason to finally do so.  We arrived slightly early for our dinner reservation and were offered to wait in their little lounge area. After being seated we were quickly greeted by our waiter who was very friendly.  Before dinner they provided some bread with duck pate, which wasn't really my cup of tea. They also gave us two huge and very delicious  pop overs. I have always wanted to try pop overs so this was an awesome chance to do so. They even give you the recipe which is neat.  I hate to say it but I found the decor extremely plain with nothing really to admire. The music was also very bland. I know you are supposed to be there for the food but good music and beautiful design really add to a dining experience.  The steak was everything you would want in a steak. A nice little char on the outside, melts in your mouth and packed full of flavor. The side dishes are a bit on the smaller side but the steaks are so big that it's not like you won't get full. I also loved how all the toppings for the baked potato were separate and were a great amount. I always find myself having to ask for extra toppings while this time I did not.  This was definitely a wonderful way to celebrate our anniversary. I was slightly disappointed they didn't offer a little something for our celebration but we still enjoyed ourselves.",

    "text": "I asked what she was hungry for, and she wanted stuffed mushrooms.  A quick search on Yelp turned up this establishment, reviews were good, restaurant was within view from the hotel, so...  BLT Steak is located in the Bally Casino. Apparently the acronym BLT is for Bistro Laurent Tourondel.  Laurent Tourondel being the Executive Chef/ owner of BLT with multiple locations in the US and around the world.  We sat at the bar, in some very comfortable chairs.  Very comfortable!  After our drinks were served, complimentary fresh baked popovers w/Gruyere cheese were brought out. Just two words, unique and excellent! A bit of butter, a little wine ... could have called it a meal at that point.  Stuffed mushroom cap appetizer was next, and packed with flavor.  Maybe a tad overcooked, but to be fair, the reduction in moisture actually intensified the flavor. Not a huge deal as all four of the caps were eaten; I'll take credit for three of them!  Bone in New York Strip was brought out medium rare as requested. The steak had excellent flavor, with a wonderful char on it. But, I don't think I'm being too picky to say, a $61 steak should be way more tender, shouldn't be chewy!  Service at the bar was excellent, with three different people making our experience a very good one.  We split the steak and mushroom side, and along with four drinks, a $150 bill was dropped. Not something you do every day, so overall, it was worth it.  Kinda goes without saying, but there are endless restaurants to eat at in Vegas, but we both agreed the atmosphere, food and service would definitely cause us to return.",

The cut of meat I ordered was the Filet and my co-worker ordered the Rib-eye. They were both cooked perfectly however, my steak was crazy salty. My husband and I don't eat a ton of salt any more and this way beyond the normal savoriness of a steak. My co-worker however, did really enjoy his steak. They do have a huge wine selection which was nice. Also, they don't play with their prices. I thought it was overly expensive for the quality of food. There were other items on the menu. Maybe I'll give it another shot when in Vegas.",

When I went up to ask if someone could take our drink orders, the bartender said \"there's no server for you but I can give you a menu\" then he preceeded to say \"where you're sitting is actually only for people who's waiting to eat at the restaurant...this place is EMPTY. The restaurant doesn't even open until 5 and happy hour starts at 4...so who the hell are they serving?? Horrible customer service and to think, I was going to eat here after eating at Gordon Ramsay's STEak last night. The light skinned bartender hasn't come around after giving us horrible attitude. I'm actually going to complain to their manager. Horrible service. Your drinks weren't even that great. Go to GORDON RAMSAYS STEAK INSTEAD. I'll post more",

The entire BLT experience was excellent. The ambience let's you know that you are in for a great meal and dining experience. The waiter was spot on very friendly and knowledgeable. He made sure that we were there not just a meal but an experience.  The food was delightful. From the bread poppers which are just heavenly, they even include the recipe in case you want to make them at home.  I ordered the filet, while my wife ordered the ribeye. Both were cooked exactly as we requested and were excellent. My wife had ordered potato skins, which I admit seemed odd to be on the menu. However, once they arrived, I saw that they weren't any ordinary potato skins. They were top notch right along with everything else on the menu.  The glazed carrots were excellent as well. To finish off the evening, we had the carrot cake and the strawberry sundae. Both desserts were excellent and a fitting way to end the evening.  BLT is a must visit when in Vegas.",

The service was impeccable and every dish we ordered was as flavorful as the next. Even the bread  was amazing. Ok ok in all fairness they were these delicious pillows of gruyere  \"popovers\". The crust was crispy and the inside was so soft. Oh so good.  I had one cocktail with dinner and that was delicious! It was a spicy margarita. Only a small kick to it but tasted fresh as hell!  My steak came out sizzling and at the perfect temperature, medium. We got a couple sides, veggies and truffle mashed potatoes. Those potatoes were something else. All this awesome truffle flavor. Seriously you have to try them! My absolute favorite part of the meal is always dessert, because I always have room for dessert. LOL. I have to recommend trying the souffle crepe. It was interesting but crazy good! It had a passion fruit topping. The tart and sweetness of it complimented the delicateness of the souffle.  Loved it! Simply put, amazing dinner! The service was on point too!  Check it!!",

The second drink wasn't good either, but it would have been rude to say so, I think. The amuse bouche was a good Pate/terrine.  Popovers not as good as the DC location. The \"American Wagyu\" ribeye was a huge letdown.  It was a solid steak, but not distinguishable from middling steakhouse steaks, and certainly not as good as other steaks I have had at BLT DC or steakhouses of its ilk.  A pretty bad deal.  Pleasant fixing experience, but felt like I paid $100 for an stripmall steak.",

    "text": "I don't normally use profanity in my reviews, but \"Jiminy Jillikers Batman!\", that was an amazing meal! Hopefully the Yelp higher-ups don't see that and everything will be gravy baby!   BLT Steak really blew me away during my visit. The ambiance is amazing considering this restaurant is located in the back area of Bally's Casino. I was surprised to see that BLT has an open concept location. I thought the slot machines and general white noise of the casino would bleed into the restaurant, but once you walk-in casual conversations and soft music is all you pretty much hear.   The service was impeccable from the first glass of wine that was poured to the end of the dessert menu. Every time a food order was served it came with a brief explanation on how it was prepared and what exactly was on your plate from left to right. After each course, plates were promptly taken away and glasses were refilled, the table was cleaned, new silverware was placed down, and I was ready for the next foodie exploration.   The food at BLT is amazing!  I didn't necessarily love everything I ate, but still respected the time and craftsmanship that went into it. For example, we were given a Duck Liver Mousse in a small mason jar with a sealed lid along with some sliced and toasted whole grain bread. This was compliments of the Chef and although the presentation was beautiful, this wasn't my favorite. Guess I'm not the \"Duck Liver Mousse\" type of guy. I also tried cheese and bacon crostinis with a sliced meat plate which consisted of sliced Chorizo, Sopressata and few other cured meats, I can't recall their names, but these were absolutely amazing. Great way to get my palate and tummy ready for business.  After the appetizers the main course arrived...Braised Short Ribs, Truffle Mashed Potatoes and grilled White Asparagus. This was a sexy looking meal, literally food porn right in front of my eyes; I felt naughty. The Braised Short Ribs came to the table in a cast iron cauldron and it was still simmering in it's own juices. These savory juices added an aroma to the table that made my dinner mates increasing jealous with every waft. I dug into this large portion of short ribs and was amazed at how easy they slid off the bone. I took my first bite and I swear the meat was dissolving before I even began to chew. To describe these as tender would be an understatement; buttery, smooth and delicious would be a good start. Then I got crazy and added the Truffle Mashed Potatoes to each bite of short ribs. I think I went into a full food orgasmic episode. I couldn't stop.  Every bite made me more and more excited. If you're not getting it, this meal was f**king amazing!  As I slowly started to come out of my food induced wet dream. I sat there and couldn't stop thinking about the meal that was presented to me. Holy smokes there's no possible way to fit any more food in me...\"Would you like to see the dessert menu?\" our serve inquired. \"Yes, that would great!\", I exclaimed. I won't get into these sweet creamy details because my I might make a mess all over again. I'll just say, \"Banana Cream Pie\". Oh Yeah.   This place is a must try whether you're a tourist or a local. Bring your father-in-law here and maybe he'll finally call you a man, and shake your hand.",

I was disappointed in the level of service in celebrating our wedding anniversary. Barely recognized our arrival and even less when we were leaving.  The manager didn't come by our table once to see how things were going.  We told them during the reservation that we were celebrating our anniversary and not a single person recognized this during our dinner.    Bottom line:  Bally's hotel does not seem to be on par with other establishments and the BLT steak is no different.  We wanted to go to Gordon Ramsay Steak, but time available did not work out with us.  We'll have to call them early next time.  Do not waste your time/money with BLT Steak!",

Our waiter (Jonathan) was very friendly, provided excellent recommendations, and answered all our questions with fine detail. Was very knowledgeable about the menu.  The filet mignon and bone - in strip were both superb - very juicy, tender, and almost melt in your mouth, with a buttery-pepper crust that is inexplicable. Mashed potatoes were very creamy with just the right portion for two people to share; asparagus was also done impeccably well. Pop-overs were provided to the table with butter and sea salt to top off. Food was delightful and tasty in all accounts.  Overall, wonderful dinner, excellent staff and great environment. Highly recommend to all looking for a great steak house. Will definitely come again.",

Total amount spent for 2 people and disingenuous experience for nearly $300.   Oh, and I am writing this review as I am wrapping a great meal Mastro's Streak house in Crystals Mall at city center.",

The came the bread, their cheese popovers. These were warm and ridiculously good.   The steaks: I got the dry aged bone in ribeye mid rare, was perfect and also ridiculously good. My friend got the ny strip mid rare, we didn't send it back but it was definitely much closer to rare.   The sides were disappointing. The carrots looked steamed with some weird mint herb thing in it. The string beans were fine but not impressive.   Then finally the chef sent out a free brownie bite thing which seemed like it was sitting out for a long while.  Overall come for the steak and popovers, skip the sides and dessert.",

Two of the three steaks didn't come out at requested temp. Even after sending one back it still didn't come back at temp. The carrots were undercooked, truffle potatoes were runny and I had requested Horseradish Sauce which came out half way there the meal. Waiter didn't seem overly concerned about the steak temp or the delay in the sauce was like whatever.   The steaks were charred on the outside undercooked and lacked flavor.  There are many other places that have steak in the name and serve a better meal.  Wouldn't recommend.",

    "text": "The Good: The steak.  The Bad: Crazy prices.  Why charge separately for sides?  The Review: I'm not much for fine dining. I hate paying $60 for a puny dish with some nice presentation and \"umami\" flavor. However, I will dish out some $$$ on a quality steak. I was a bit apprehensive about coming to this place because I was worried we were underdressed (wrestling t-shirt and shorts) but you didn't sense a hint of condescension from any of the staff. I ordered the $60+ bone-in steak w/ marrow. My buddy ordered the same thing, I was a bit disappointed at how much marrow he got compared to mine.  The steak was juicy and the cream spinach was great.  They brought out a few items \"courtesy of the chef\" for us to try. The duck pate w/ crackers was really good, as was the brownie at the end.  My friend opted for the $92 Wagyu steak. It was smaller than our 22oz monsters at 16oz, but you could taste the difference in quality.  However was it really worth $92?  I don't know about that.  I was a bit disappointed that they charged for additional sides, especially after going to a place like House of Prime Rib in SF that just charges you for the cut of meat and everything else is included.  Other than that I'd definitely recommend folks looking for a quality steak to check out BLT Steak.",

When I ordered it the waitress asked me if I know that it's raw meat chopped up to which I replied \"yes, hence its called tartare\".  Dish looked pretty good with the typical presentation...some greens on top and toasted bread on the side.  I have to say that the tartare itself was grrrreat, I did however send the bread back as it was cold and chewy.  At the end of the meal I ordered the chocolate peanut butter mousse- there was nothing moussey about it, it was dry, not smooth - very disappointing. I think the waiter knew something was up when I left the big piece almost untouched , but he didn't dare asking . At the end waiter did take the mousse off my bill",

The cream sauce was a nice and delicate but was negated by the overcooked lobster. I should her to think if Gordon Ramsay where they're he would have sent it back to the kitchen, before it made its way to me.  On a side note, the hen of the woods mushrooms were lovely and i would come back for the popovers. As Gordon Ramsey would say: \"What a shame.\"",

    "text": "I was fortunate to receive an invite to BLT Steak, the newest restaurant at Bally's Las Vegas. Our table for four wasn't quite ready for us, so we grabbed a drink at the bar. Our bartender happily suggested one of their signature cocktails with basil and watermelon. It was mighty refreshing, slightly sweet and herbaceaous. I enjoyed it, but the overall crowd pleaser was their take on the Long Island Iced Tea. It was refreshing, with some bite. Just what I like in a cocktail. In addition to cocktails, they offer top shelf liquors, bottled beers and varied selection of wine. Prices range $8-$15 for most libations.  Once seated we were given an amuse bouche of pate and jelly, with toasts. It was a lovely presentation, but a bit rich. Later came the popovers that just might have made BLT famous. These monsters are light and airy, simply perfect with a pat of butter and pinch of salt. The egginess couldn't help but remind our group of Yorkshire pudding.  The menu offers seafood and poultry, but you must try the steaks ($20-$60). They are aged (mostly dry), broiled and finished with herb butter. We had the filet and bone in NY strip. Both had beautiful crust and were cooked to a perfect medium rare. More juicy and tender than you might expect. They offer sauces to accompany the steaks for a few bucks, but we agreed we liked the steaks on their own best. Though, the horseradish that came with the three mustards was the favorite. We also had the 2 pound lobster which had a lovely presentation, great flavor, it was delicate and tender; the trouble was there wasn't enough meat to it.  The sides ($10-$13) were heavy on taters, you could have them six different ways. We opted to try a variety, we shared onion rings, potato skins, hen of the woods mushroom, and caramelized brussels sprouts. We found the sides, with the exception of the brussels sprouts - now, those were delicious - to be the weakest link of the meal. We thought they were too basic, we expected a twist that would elevate your traditional onion ring or potato skin, but nope they fell flat.  Dessert ($10) was really decadent! Portions are large and good for sharing. We had the crepe souffle, warm chocolate tart, peanut butter chocolate mousse and mini doughnuts. The passion fruit sauce on the crepe would've been better served as a drizzle. It was cloying and overpowering. The tart was more of a lava cake, but the pistachio ice cream was wonderful. The PB and chocolate mousse was rich and heavenly, though, I didn't care for the banana ice cream pairing. The doughnuts were light and similar to churros and I really enjoyed the coffee ice cream.  Overall, it was a great meal. The staff, while warm and welcoming, still have kinks to work out, but in time they should be operating a well run ship. Rumor has it, the Sterling Brunch will return.",

Also got a side of chimichurri sauce  Kobe Filet with green beans - Melts in your mouth! Oh my goodness my husband was in love. He also got the peppercorn sauce with added some heat flavor.

This time around there was more people but we still got sat right away with reservations. Our server accommodated our time constraint. We were in and out within an hour. This steak resturant goes above and beyond for their customers.   We will definitely return again.",

    "text": "I liked this place a lot better when it was just \"Bally's Steak House\", then they revamped everything and changed the menu.   Now, I don't necessarily hate this place but the food was meh. My family and I ordered the oysters, tuna tartar, crab legs, rib eye, filet mignon, onion rings, lobster, and green beans.   Oysters - I'm not a big oyster fan but the one oyster I did have tasted fresh and was good. My parents love oysters and they dug this dish so that's safe enough to say that the oysters here are good quality.   Tuna Tartar - Fresh fish and great sauce. Awesome.   Crab Legs - Not as meaty as I thought they'd be, they were seriously lacking.   Onion Rings - These were terrible. Not crispy at all, they were borderline soft and mushy. I don't know what was going on when they made these, but the taste of soft batter and hot oil made me feel sick.   Rib Eye - I don't know why, but my steak was literally charred. I understand when you cook steak it's supposed to have marks on it, but this was unbelievable, all I was tasting was burned leather.   Filet Mignon - Good cause it wasn't as charred as the rib eye.   Lobster - Easily the best. Great tasting, fresh, and meaty.   Green Beans - Typical green beans you'd find at any steak restaurant. They're okay.   The service was good, the price is about what you'd expect at any steakhouse, and the restaurant is kept clean and tidy. The ambiance is good and there is a romantic atmosphere to the dimly lit restaurant floor. This place has its hits and misses and averages out to a decent place to get dinner. I would come back again.",

    "text": "We went to BLT steakhouse which is located in the Bally's casino for dinner and it started off really well. They serve you this amazing complimentary pate and then they follow up with some freshly baked popovers which was way better than any bread I have ever been served in a restaurant. Then it just started to be ok after that. I ordered the shrimp cocktail which came with 4 large shrimp nicely presented but the cocktail sauce tasted like something out of a jar nothing special. My husband ordered the filet which was the only steak that wasn't dry aged which he doesn't like and it was ok. He ordered the macaroni and cheese as a side dish because everything is a la carte and they never brought that so he had just \"steak\". So since that's all we had we ordered 2 desserts. The banana cream pie was pretty good it had a nice nut crust which I liked and the lemon cheesecake which was so small considering it was $12. Yikes! I would probably go back because the popover was that good.",

    "text": "One word EXCEPTIONAL! My husband and I are first timers to Las Vegas. On our last evening we planned a romantic evening, dinner, shows and light attractions. We never anticipated what we received! BLT not only has the best bone in T-bone steak; they have an outstanding wait staff. Willie was the most respectful attentive gentleman we have encountered in many years. The young ladies that greeted us at the entrance, awesome. Last but not least, Charlayne Buckley is a delightful young lady! We had the best conversation about our journey in our life and hopefully we left a lasting impression as did they. For their gratitude, they ALL deserve 5 's in our book. We will definitely return to Vegas just to dine at this establishment again! Thank you BLT for making our vacation OUTSTANDING!",

    "text": "We had a great glimpse into BLT Steak from bar seating and the appetizer menu.  Entree prices were very high for our late evening stop in.  The waitress was friendly and prompt with our beverage of choice, imported beers in the $7 range.  We ordered potato skins and a souffle crepe in passion fruit sauce.  At least 10 flavorful potato skins arrived.  The crepe was to die for decadent--possibly the best food I ate all week while there!  That alone would make me want to return!  She brought over complimentary popovers, their huge signature gruyere-laced Yorkshire pudding type things.  We found them to be too crusty (almost burned) on the outsde but we enjoyed picking out the cheesy-flaky innards.  and free was a nice touch.  It was a trendy place to hang out--and not too loud, we could converse.  It was tucked in an intimate corner of the large lobby floor and is one of only two restaurants in this hotel (Bally's).",

My steak was overcooked slightly, normally I wouldn't care but since it was $60, I had to send it back.  My wife asked for the Truffled Mac and Cheese for her side. When the food came out, the waiter brought out Truffled Mashed Potatoes. We asked the waiter about this, and he said \"Oh, but you said the Truffled Pototes.\" He then asked, \"Well do you still want the mac and cheese?\"  After we got all the sides figured out, we had a chance to talk about this with the manager. He apologized for the service. I was still disappointed in everything, especially since the bill was $160 for two steaks, two sides, and two glasses of water (the water was free).",
