The staff is extremely friendly and fun, the sushi is out of this world, the rolls are out of control I can barely finish one roll. Just reading the menu is fun in its self. They have some of the craziest names for their sushi rolls!. I also love how large the restaurant is most sushi places I have been to are kind of tiny. Oh I suggest taking anyone whose birthday it is here they put on a nice little birthday scene.",

I like the various ingredients and taste difference in all their rolls. The decorating is fabulous and the atmosphere is even better. We have went there many times, and there has been a few times our order has gotten messed up and they were more than happy to fix the problem, let us keep what they gave to us by mistake, and not charge us for any of it. I would definitely recommend them to everyone. The only dislike I have is that they don't have a happy hour what so ever. There is another sushi place we go to regularly due to their half price menu on Friday and Saturday nights. I would hope that Sushi Loca will consider adding a happy hour.",

I enjoy the enthusiasm and  interaction of the sushi chefs, but not the fact that sometimes they do a couple too many sake bombs with the customers and cause me to wait 30 minutes for one roll when everyone else at my table is already done eating. Yeah. True story. When my friend asked the waiter what was taking so long for my roll, he responded, \"sorry, they're a little drunk.\" Now, don't get me wrong, I still go there every chance I get! I have feeling that after a few more visits, I'll be upping them to a 5 star rating! Go check it out and enjoy!",

I understand that the restaurant is aimed towards an adult crowd, but I've seen a lot of kids there, and it would seem a bit odd to hear an 8 year old order an \"XXX\" or a \"One Night Stand\". If the name of what you're ordering really doesn't bother you, then you should be fine. The waiters/waitresses are very helpful and the food arrives quickly. The music playing in the background is always good, and overall, Sushi Loca is a modern and fun restaurant to go to for a great meal with not much waiting.",

    "text": "We were trying to avoid the strip and its commercialism, so we decided to try Sushi Loca, despite the name.  We are both definitely sushi snobs, so readers of this review should take that in to account.    We were there on a weekday afternoon, before dinner time.  There were only a couple of tables occupied.  We chose to eat at the sushi bar.  A brief look at the kitchen menu showed a wide variety of dishes, but we decided to stick with sushi.  We were immediately served a small dish of pickled cucumbers, which were pretty standard, but tasty.  The server brought us a small pot of hot tea.  He was efficient, clearing plates away as we finished with them.  The sushi menu is vast, consisting mostly of rolls with crazy combinations of ingredients and silly names. We generally avoid Americanized rolls at all cost, extending this even to establishments that serve them, but since they seemed to be the specialty here, we decided to try a few.  Sex on the Beach was scallops on the inside with salmon outside the rice.  The Rainbow Roll was typical, but a bit sloppily constructed (all the big combo rolls were, really).  Dragon Roll had eel and some other ingredients.  The benchmark of a good sushi bar for us is their tuna roll.  Loca's was lacking.  There was almost too much fish in it, and there wasn't any wasabi.  Sashimi octopus and squid were okay, but the temperature of the fish on these, like a number of the other pieces we had was too cold.  It wasn't frozen, but cold enough to take away from the True, subtle  flavor of the fish.   The other issue we had with the sushi was the sushi rice.  It was missing something: our theory is that it's a little short on sushi vinegar.  The highlight was a bowl of rolley rice: salmon roe and crab mixed into rice with avocado on top and a spicy kick.  The sushi chef who was dealing with our order was very nice and friendly. He was South Korean, as were the other sushi chefs and waitresses (or at least they were also speaking Korean). He had recently returned from a trip to Japan, maybe for some training?  In any case, Japanese owned and operated sushi places are not always better, but they certainly have a leg up on knowledge and details.  Sushi Loca's food was good, but not fantastic.  The atmosphere seems like it could be fun with a bit more of a crowd, and it is nicely decorated.  It wouldn't be a top choice for us, but is a decent option for those who are into funky rolls, good portions and pretty reasonable prices.",

All ingredients are fresh and generous - I know it's a desert out there how fresh can it be that's what I thought and trust me I am picky about fresh sushi! You will be as surprised as I was.  Avoid the usual rush hours (dinner Fri & Sat and you should be fine). But even with a big crowd the turnover is pretty fast you are never waiting for too long.",

Who'da thunk it just a stone's throw from Walmart and Payless? But indeed, walk through the suburban doors to find a pulsing urban atmosphere with lush red and purple velvet seat backs, black, industrial piping in the ceiling and up-tempo music to make you feel part of the IT crowd. I've lived in the NW valley for almost 5 years, and this is the first place that marries really good sushi with a really cool atmosphere. I cannot recommend the spicy garlic edamame enough. I would travel to Hender-tucky for it! Honestly. Amazing. The sushi is fresh and creative with many the R-rated maki names :) I'll let you see those for yourself.

It wasn't crowded at all at 9:45pm when we go there. So we thought: \"great! In and out. Order our food and we're done.\" Didn't happen that way at all. Don't want to go into great detail except to say we both are \"foodies\" that know alot about food, drinks, deals and service. This place is DEFINITELY NOT on my list of places to go to for good, quick service.

About 15 minutes later the sushi chef asked us what we wanted. We ordered our rolls through him. Waitress never came by again so our drinks went unfilled. I noticed several other patrons be ignored as well. Had to go up to the front desk to get a waitress to get us our check. Paid in cash and waited another 7 or so minutes just to have someone come by to take It from us. Went back up to desk and finally a few minutes later an employee took it from us.

We have some favorites we get frequently and the product is always top notch.  Last night my girl asked the guy manning the bar if he could make us a special off-menu roll. He knows what we like, made a beautiful one that we loved. He comes back, asks how we liked it, and we asked him to remember for next time so we can order again. I asked his name, he said \"Ryan\". So we tell him we're gonna call it the \"Ryan Special\". He points at menu item and says \"we already have\". LOLOLOL, this guy's done this before. \"You call #2\" he says, still pointing.  So that's our new thing, the *Ryan Special #2* Ryan is a bomb-ass sushi chef and this place is full of good stuff. Do yourself a favor: go there, eat, then #%$&ing die happy.",

The rolls are smaller and the prices have gone up, the quality of the food isn't as good anymore either. I came here last night with my family and no one was offered refills on their drinks, we arrived after the Saturday rush so there was no excuse that they were too busy. We also ordered a roll that had a cheese spread on top that was lit on fire to melt it. It tasted like pure chemicals I nearly threw up, when I asked our waiter if we could get something different he said he didn't understand and asked if we had this specific role before, not that it mattered if we did or not it taste like chemicals. We waited for our food forever as well. The service has gotten so poor here! Who ever manages or owns this location should be ashamed of how run down this place has gotten. I will no longer recommend sushi loca to anyone I know. Not to mention the demerits they received from the health district as well!",

Well it's been awhile and I came back to have a fast dinner break here since it's down the road from work.   I have to say I'm spoiled now, the Cresta before that said, \"it was good :-)\" never tried Yummy Grill before. My eyes are open now and the bar has been set. I sat at the bar and chatted with the sushi chefs for a brief moment. They are nice but no personality plus coming my way. The sushi was okay, decent...no wiggles in my seat though. I ordered a I love my ass (I don't really love my ass) and some tuna sashimi. The sashimi was pretty thick but the quality wasn't all there.   I'll be back I'm sure, can't beat a quickie sushi fix for a dinner break ;-)",

I have tried a numerous variety of the different sushi dishes on their menu and have enjoyed almost all of them, not that it was bad or sloppy, simply just not for my flavor preferences.  Our only discrepancy is if you sit at the sushi bar the wait staff assumes you will be getting sushi and dont come around as offen for instance if your my non-sushi eating wife and want to get fried rice. However that is easily mitigated if you just ask to sit at a table.",

Of course anyone can say that they have had better suishi, especially when you go to Japan or something like that.  However, I would happily eat suishi loca any day.    I only wished that they had their menu online showing the actual prices.  I am the type of person who likes to know how much I may be spending before I go to the place, but it seems so common nowadays that restaurants won't post their menus with prices online anymore in order to make sure not to lose someone.  I find this current practice  a bit shady, especially when you go to the restaurant and find out that each specialty roll is at least $13- $20 per roll.   Yes Sushi Loca I am calling you out for posting a menu with no prices on your website, shame on you!",

I only agreed to go here because 1. I wasn't the one payin haha. And 2. because I planned on ordering like hibachi steak or something.  BUT! We ordered like five or six rolls and they were all equally amazing. There's nothing negative to say because all four of us thought that their sushi tasted super great! Raw fish, seaweed, and all!  I'm also a sucker for the house salad at sushi places, and their ginger dressing was def very yummy. Hope to visit Sushi Loca again soon. :]  x",

I went there around 7pm Friday and the place was packed.  The energy was really high and exciting, but I was not feeling it.  I was expecting a quite and relaxing eventing dinner with my mom.  The music was so loud that I could not heard the server and the server was having a hard time hearing us.    This is what I ordered:  Spicy Tuna Roll was too mushy.  I had better at Yamaguchi Sushi.  Spider Roll was good, but I like Hikari Sushi version better.  Soft Shell Crab Roll was a bit spicy and dry.  It was like eating crab cake over cooked in the oven.  Caterpiller Roll was good.  Rainbow Roll - the fish was not as fresh as Hikari.  It was dry and left out too long.  Volcano no rice - This was the only think that stands out at Sushi Loca.  There were plenty of imitation crab meat with cream cheese wrap with a thin outer layer of Tuna.  The rolls were bake in Yum Yum sauce.  Overall the price is resonable, but it is not the best sushi place in town unless you live in the extreme Northwest.   I will try again when it is less busy to see if my perception can be changed about Sushi Loca.",

We are a family that loves sushi  and when there are left overs you know something is wrong. Northwest Vegas sushi restraunts have all went downhill from a few years ago.",

I have had lots of fresh sushi living on the coast and the Torro here is awesome. It melts in your mouth. I just moved to Vegas so it took me a while to find a local sushi joint I can go to once a week. This place has the quality in the fish. The Chicken Terriyaki is so good too, it's not greasy. They make it just the way I like it. This is an awesome place for quality food, the prices are good too.",

My huband tried one of their bento boxes it wasn't great but just good, we discovered more bang for the buck ordering sushi rolls and tempura off the menu.   My favorite is their eel role, my husband likes the califorina roll, I love anything with spicy tuna but he thinks its too mushy. Their roasted garlic edamame is great!   Hood food great service gook beer!",

    "text": "My family and I have come to this location for a few years now. We also eat here about twice a month. Over the last few months however, service as well as the food, has been absolutely HORRIBLE. I don't usually write reviews yet here I am. Let's start with the last time I was here before today. We all ordered, drinks came out fast. One by one however, the food trickled out. And not at all quickly. One person would be done with their food before the next persons came out. And we didn't order anything time consuming either. Not to mention it was a slow day. So my dad always orders brown rice, they forgot per usual. It took 20 more minutes for his brown rice to come out. He was done with his food by that time. On top of that, they hadn't put in 2 of our orders. So while everyone had finished eating, 2 of us had been sitting there with no food at all. Eventually they realized their mistake and comped the 2 orders, which was absolutely necessary. During the time, our waitress never checked in on us, only when we asked about our food. She was also very curt.   Now today, which is what made me write this review. Upon entering, we see it's packed. Nonetheless, you're in customer service. You do not get to give paying customers attitude. The waitress (same one as the last time who forgot to input our orders) is once again curt and not at all attentive. She forgets my brothers drink order. Fine. She forgets my dads brown rice as always (he gets gout otherwise it wouldn't be a big deal). This time it didn't take as long to come out. 2 of our meals come out, we finish eating them, and 2 of our party still has yet to get their food. Shocking. Not to mention my shrimp hibachi was ONCE AGAIN over cooked and TOO SALTY. Everyone eventually gets their food besides my brother, who only ordered udon.............noodles and broth for crying out loud. Mind you, the waitress knew he was waiting for it as she kept coming by saying \"udon almost done\". I mean, were they making the noodles from scratch back there? Highly doubt it as my brother stated how it wasn't even worth the wait.   To sum up, we receive horrible service every time as well as mediocre food, every. Single. Time.  Why we come back here is beyond me. If I could give 0 stars, I most definitely would.",

Came her with a few people for a birthday dinner and not only did they give us things we didn't order, they didn't give us the things we DID order either. No refills on water. Didn't give us any plates even when we asked multiple times.  Towards the end, someone would come by every five minutes and ask what we needed. The rest of our orders that we've repeated almost 5 times now?   So we asked to cancel the rest and just give us the check. Then they came back AGAIN and asked what we were waiting for. Seriously. Just the check and to cancel the rest of our orders. Please for the love of God.  So the waitress just stares at me like shes confused.   Aw cripes.  Finally the check comes. And guess what. The stuff we never got is still on the check.   When all is said and done, the sushi is fine. Not ala carte good, but it was good. Maybe I'll try their other location. Because this place needs to get it together.",

    "text": "Recently came here for dinner with my girlfriend. I had high expectations for this place in terms of food and sushi rolls. We were heavily let down.  The sashimi here - great. Nice big cuts and pretty good quality.  The Steak Hamachi dinner here is awesome! My favorite dish by far!  Let's get down to the sushi rolls here - the reason we came. They are just ok.  They have the potential to be great - but they miss. Most of the rolls are heavily-laden with sauce which drowns out much of the taste and flavor. The rolls are deceivingly big. The rolls are stuffed with tons of  spicy \"crab\" and their \"soft-shell crab\". Making for just a filler and topper of the rolls.   All of these rolls seem to be badly poor knock-offs of rolls found at 'I Love Sushi'. The names on the rolls are different  - and so is the quality and the amount of real fish you are actually getting.   Rolls we ate: TTL- Favorite of all the rolls Final Fantasy 2 - Second favorite  Put your hands up  Jackpot  Taste like my ex gf I did your gf No Pain No Gain - least favorite - way too much sauce all drenched over it.  If you don't believe me - I implore you to go eat at 'I Love Sushi' to taste the difference.  If I lived on this end of town - this wouldn't be a terrible go-to. But knowing that other sushi places out there trump this place; for that I can only give this place three stars.",

Despite the fact that this location is so far away from my house, we still take the time to drive here. Service is excellent here! Everyone makes sure the customers feel welcomed!All servers smile all the time, and they are very attentive!  At lunch time, besides the regular menu items, you can choose between two different lunch specials, for around $10-$12 each. Both including miso soup, salad, a variety of entrees, sushi and rice. It's very fulfilling!  My favorite items from the menu: Oh My God ! - inside - crab, avocado, cucumber/ outside- cooked shrimp, scallops, mushrooms, mochi (rice cake), smelt eggs. Very flavorful, tasty! Crazy Horse - smoked salmon, cream cheese, avocado, green onions with eel sauce. Melting in my mouth ... yummy! Final Fantasy 2 - inside- spicy soft shell crab, shrimp tempura, cucumber/ outside- spicy soft shell crab, assorted fish, avocado and spicy mayo ponzu sauce. Very fresh tasting ingredients in every rolls! Double Down- inside -spicy soft shell crab, spicy tuna, spicy crab, cucumber/ outside-spicy soft shell crab, spicy tuna, spicy crab, salmon, yellowtail with sesame mustard sauce. The spices and the fish all together just a great harmony of flavors!  68 and I owe you one! Taste like my Ex-girlfriend! And many other amazing rolls ... I like them all!  Also, I love their Green Tea mochi, and my absolutely favorite one is the Mango mochi!  Happy to return anytime!",

    "text": "The raunchy titled rolls are part of restaurant's gimmick --  I'm still trying to figure out if the Final Fantasy rolls were named after the popular video game franchise or if they're alluding to another form of entertainment.   Sushi Loca is a typical neighborhood sushi joint  with a large sushi bar, plenty of seating, Japanese wall decor, and a music playlist that has a collection of J-Pop and Pitbull tracks.   All right, let's get down to the food. This restaurant has a downside: there isn't an AYCE option which means you can end up spending a lot of money. The sushi rolls on the Extraordinary Rolls menu can cost about $12.00 per roll. Sushi and sashimi can cost approximately $5.00 per order. If you like masago with quail eggs like I do, quail eggs are an additional charge.  Dynamite: Rice with sliced mushrooms, scallops, cream cheese, green onions, and smelt eggs -- all baked together. I'm used to eating Dynamites that consist mainly of seafood, and this one could've used more than just a few pieces of scallops; the mushrooms were a good fit, though.   Nobu Special: This is the roll my boyfriend ordered from the Extraordinary Rolls menu. It's filled with cream cheese and fried salmon, and avocado on the outside and smelt eggs and dots of hot sauce to top it off. Not a bad roll overall. It had a little bite to it because of the jalapeno slices and the hot sauce. Usually, that kind of combo for a sushi roll makes my stomach upset, but it was executed well.   Salmon Collar: A roll and a dynamite weren't enough for our appetites, so we finished dinner off with salmon collars. The tops were nicely grilled, but the bottoms were over charred. Fortunately, that issue didn't ruin our meal. Overall, it was good.  The service was fine; though, I don't think this is the sort of place where servers are talkative and ask how you're doing. It's basically get the job done and leave the customer alone until they call on you -- sometimes, that's not a bad thing. My one criticism is that it was difficult to track down our server.  I haven't had positive experiences dining at sushi restaurants on the northern part of town, but the food here is better than expected. Now, if only this place had an AYCE option...

Let's take this review step by step.   APPETIZERS: I always like to start off with the garlic edemame. It's a great way to start off your meal with a little miso soup.   ENTREES: Their chicken habachi & seafood yakisoba has never disappointed!   SASHIMI: Their sashimi has always been fresh for me. My favorites are definitely the halibut and yellow tail. You can never go wrong..  ROLLS: Let's get to the fun part! If you like a little spice & kick, I definitely recommend the Kiss of Fire. The jalapenos give this roll a great kick. Tastes like my ex-girlfriend has a great blend of tastes and textures that make it an overall great roll. The two are definitely my favorite!   Definitely my regular sushi joint and worth the trip for a girl from the westside!",

Sh*t are they closed?!? There's no cars! But the open sign was on. Oh yeah it's 3:30p on a Wednesday, ok. So since it's slow maybe they should do happy hour to bring business! No happy hour :(  Their prices were kinda high. It might be because I usually only go sushi during happy hour. 3 rolls and a dessert for about $50. (could've done 2 AYCE sushi lunches!.. or dinners at Island Sushi...)  Quality was okay. The salmon on the Sex on the Beach was pretty fresh. The seaweed seemed different from other places, dunno good or bad, but chewy.  Also got the cucumber island roll. No rice! The sauce it came with was weird though. and wasn't anything special. And also had the I Did Your Girlfriend roll. It was pretty loaded and good sauce. Tastes like there's horseradish in the sauce though, which was not mentioned in the description and the bf hates that taste. So had to eat the whole roll myself. I don't like that idea. I like variety. Too much of one thing no good.  Then dessert! I overheard another table order Tempura + Cheesecake. Yup. Delish!! Comes with blueberry preserve and chocolate sauce. Odd, but totally worked.  I'd actually rate 3 1/2 stars. Service was average. Pricing seems high for such average food though. There's other places I'd rather go. Photos are posted though. I think I did good with the pictures :)",

Chose some rolls that had \"crab meat\" in them, according to the menu...let's be clear, it was not \"crab meat\" at all but that fake crab \"stuff.\"  Personally, I don't care if sushi places want to use that but I have no desire to eat it and the menu should be accurate.  Don't call it what it's not.  We ordered some other very forgettable rolls and none of them were any good.  We threw away half of it and that never happens when we order from our favorite sushi place (Naka Sushi...man, I wish that place was closer to my house!).  Now I know for sure...NEVER AGAIN!",

This place is clean and spacious--with the bar being the focal point of the restaurant. The women waitresses were dressed in kimonos and the men were dressed in black attire. Happy hour is from 11am-2pm.  I came in here for dinner and was very excited to check out their sushi menu. Once seated, the waitress asked for our drinks. Moments later, she came out with the drinks along with a tiny individual plate of  thinly sliced (slightly) pickled-cucumbers with shredded imitation crabs that was sprinkled with sesame seeds. A great and light appetizer to munch on while the sushi rolls were being made. All the sushi rolls that was ordered came out very presentable and got us all excited to taste. The fish all tasted fresh and the rolls were average-big in size, definitely not skimpy at all!!   I have posted pictures of the rolls that my table ordered. My favorite had to be the \"KISS OF FIRE\" roll. It had spicy crab, spicy tuna, spicy soft shell crab, and cucumber in the inside; and spicy crab, spicy tuna, spicy soft shell crab, albacore with a slice of jalapeno with a special sauce on the outside of the roll. Definitely, it is a must-try roll! My second recommended roll had to be \"Opps, She is Just 17\" roll--the mountain of fried onion strings added an humph of textures to the simple delicious roll.",

Edamame and the miso soup were the best things I ordered and def was not worth the price. The music they played was the worst playlist of songs I ever heard and I noticed it even more Bc the food was so horrible and it was kind of an appropriate soundtrack to the meal",

    "text": "Not a fan.   They were quick to seat us. There is no hostess, but the servers direct you to your seating. She pointed at the booth down the way; did not guide us to our seating. We sat in a deep, comfy booth that could easily accommodate six fatties.   On a Wednesday afternoon, my party of two was one of about four or five other parties present. Two servers, two sushi chefs, and some back of the house kitchen employees.   Large sushi bar, seats about 18.   The restaurant/ sushi bar takes up two units. It's a large beautiful space with soaring ceilings, nice decor, kept clean. The hanging pictures are tilted, but whatev.   I ordered the \"No Pain No Gain\" roll (~14). Being that it is a Korean-manned sushi joint, more than half of the sushi rolls with have some spice element. If there's tuna, it will prolly be spicy tuna. If there's soft shel crab, it will prolly be spicy soft shell crab. The No Pain No Gain roll is one of them heart attack meals: spicy soft shell crab and cucumber, wrapped with tuna and slathered with scallops, krab, and spicy mayo, all then run through the baker device and served with a generous serving of some mystery spicy raayu (spicy oil) with mayo, green onions, and ponzu maybe?). But it was hardly spicy. I felt as though there was neither pain, nor gain.   I also got a yellowtail collar (~$12?), which was beautifully cooked -- not over cooked, not at all dry -- served with a large portion of ponzu.   The other person in my party got a California roll and one of those combo meals where you pick two items, also comes with miso soup, rice, and a salad. She picked teriyaki beef (nothing wrong there) and chicken karage (sic), which was near tasteless.   The above listed items plus a mochi ice cream (2 pcs) came out to $44 before tip.   The servers wear kimono-esque outfits. If you're a kimono/ yukata person, don't look directly at their outfits. Your eyes might sting a little (arm pit seams ripped out, poor excuse for obi, etc). But who cares, right? We don't eat yukata.   The house plays club dance music. I didn't think it was too loud (previous reviews from other Yelpers indicate the contrary).   The food was fine, but one of the two servers was just awful. The service killed the experience. She dropped food off with out a word, asked how everything was and walked away while we were responding. Then at the end of our meal, there was not a server in sight for a good seven minutes.   They are open late (til 2a most nights?).   #offthestrip #noncasino",

It's in a massive WalMart lot but it's pretty easy to see. The interior is nice, they have large velvet booths, they have tables and you can also sit at the sushi counter. We had many different servers and I was a little confused as to who was really in charge of our order. Nothing bad happened, I was just confused. I think that all of the waiters/bussers hit every table and maybe at the end of the night they split the tips? I don't know, but we had 4 people give us our drinks and food.  All of the sushi names are raunchy and sexy. It was fun. The food came so fast I felt like I was in a drive-thru but it was fresh and delicious so I wasn't complaining!  Will definitely come back.  Oh yeah, don't you hate it when you go into a sushi restaurant and it is adequate to good, and you're thinking to yourself that it is a nice little place and then you go to the restroom and it's down this long, dingy hallway and you have to walk by the kitchen and see the employees and the bathroom itself is cheap and dirty?  Well this is not like that at all!!!! I love sushi restaurants, all restaurants for that matter, that actually care about their bathrooms. Thank you for having a clean hallway and a hallway that doesn't pass by an open kitchen. Thank you for having a stylish and clean bathroom with more than one toilet.

The names of the sushi are a little risque (I assume some people are put off by that) but whatever... its still fish wrapped in rice.  The spicy ponzu sauce is amazing!  I like the atmosphere in the restaurant, but I order for pick-up more often.  I love being able to order online, and I've never EVER waited for my food beyond the time they specified.  Staff is friendly, but I admit I don't always catch every word they say.  But that's ok, its an ethic food and they're doing their best with English.

    "text": "My wife and I were starving for some good tasting sushi, so I Yelp'd and found Sushi Loca.  We went on a Sunday night and the restaurant was wicked busy, but plenty of seating was available.  I'm sure on a Friday or Saturday night, there's probably a wait time, but we lucked out this trip.  First, the menu is crazy!  This is perfect considering the restaurant is in Las Vegas.  Also, they have a grip of specials and menu choices galore. But enough of that, we wanna talk about the food, right!  We ordered the mixed tempura appetizer and four rolls.  My wife had water and I had green tea. Our rolls consisted of: a Rainbow, Holy Cow, Lasagna Roll and the Heart Attack.  The tempura batter is a little thicker that the batter that I correlate with Japanese dining, but it was tasty. The shrimp were monsters and cooked nicely and the vegetables were fresh!   I always order a Rainbow roll.  I feel that a good sushi restaurant should be able to make a basic Rainbow roll with good flavor.  Sushi Loca succedded in this realm.  The fish was fresh and consisted of thick,  healthy cuts of meat.  It was delish!   The Holy Cow was amazing as well.  The salmon was cool against the heat of the spicy sauce, but not over whelming.  The Holy Cow was demolished but enjoyed tremendously.   The Lasagna Roll is a baked roll and takes a little longer.  The only issue we had was the cream cheese wasn't melted as much as it should have been and the rolls were only warm, not hot.  For me, fish has to be hot or cold, not in between and I'm sure, when prepared correctly, this roll is at the top of it's game.  This roll is delicious, but be ready, it's also super rich!!!!  This roll is beautiful on the plate and we may have to try it again. If we do, I'll let y'all know what I think.   Lastly, we had the Heart Attack.  This roll is a deep-fried roll.  It's pretty good. The only issue we had with this roll is it came out about 10 minutes after most of our table had been cleared-- we thought the waitress had forgotten to get it ordered.  This roll has some heat to it!  It's deep fried, cut into pieces and garnished with a jalapeno and a dab of sarracha.  It's also served with a dish of sarracha mayo and teriyaki for dipping.  If you like smoked salmon, heat and deep fried cream cheese then this is your roll.   Overall, Sushi Loca is a nice spot to get some good sushi.  The restaurants staff is friendly, quick and the location is good.  The food is reasonably priced and the fish is fresh.  My only suggestion is to mix it up a little, but enjoy the good eats!",

But service has been going down hill for last couple of months. On our last visit, maybe only three tables were occupied and even then, service was bad. Drinks came almost when we were done eating.  Waitress didn't even give us plates. Even felt a little discriminated by staff. Very disappointing to see a place that I really enjoyed coming to eat with my husband, not want us to come back in the future.",

We asked for wasabi a few times and had to ask 2 different servers till they final brought it.  The rolls we tried were the final fantasy, holy cow,spider roll, don't touch mustache, and sex on the beach, and the jackpot. I was not impressed with any of the rolls at all and fish did not taste fresh at all. I am very disappointed in this places and unfortunate will not be back.",

    "text": "Having previously been a big fan of Sushi Loca, tonight's experience has left me mildly despondent. They may well be ok at making Americanized rolls with funky little names, but their skill with traditional sushi is woefully lacking.    Let's start from the beginning.  The ginger and wasabi came out looking a bit tired with slightly dry crusts forming on the edges (as if they had been prepped too long before being served), and the cucumber salad with vinegar and bits of imitation crab meat had obviously been left out judging by their room-temp warmth.  Ok...I was willing to let that slide.  I wanted traditional sushi tonight and ordered the following nigiri: tuna, tamago, cucumber, and ika.  The cucumber roll looked like a three-year-old rolled it up, and it fell apart with the many slivers of cucumber scattering on the first bite (why not just put a few, or even one chunk of cuke in there?).  The too-long piece of tamago was laid over about 25 grains of rice, and the seaweed 'ribbon' did nothing to hold it together because the egg bit was five times bigger than the rice...that was fine, it still tasted ok, even if it made me chuckle.  The tuna never showed up.  Oh, I also ordered the garlic chili edamame, which was overcooked to limp greyish death, a bit like the Christmas Brussels sprouts that an English granny might serve, and the husks kind of broke up and came away along with the beans as my teeth tried to pull just the soybeans away.    And so to the ika, usually my very favorite nigiri!  Hmm...it wasn't really bright white...it was a bit yellowy beige, like lightly coffee-stained teeth.  Eww, what was that about?  *sniff* P-U.  Being 1/2 Okinawan and having lived in Okinawa and mainland Japan, and loving sushi, and knowing about the properties of fresh fish products (one of which is that it does not smell like anyone's ex-girlfriend), I knew that fresh ika was not supposed to smell like (I will refrain from being even more graphic than their funky sushi roll names and just say) THAT. This was not the worst part.  When I explained to the lady who asked if everything was ok that no, the ika was old, she told me it was fresh from their supplier today.  I told her I didn't care when she got it or from where and that it was way off and asked her to smell it.  She smelled it and told me that was how it was supposed to be and that's what raw squid is like.  I don't blame her for trying...she had no idea if I'd ever eaten sushi before and may have assumed me to be a raw fish virgin (it transpired in the back-and-forth that she only eats the cooked stuff there, so maybe she just didn't know herself what ika is supposed to be like).  I dread to think what illness I would have contracted had I taken her word for it and eaten the stinky raw squid.  She again said she just got it fresh and repeated that it was good. \"YOU can eat it then,\" I suggested and even managed to smile. \"I'm not touching it, and I'm not paying for it.\"  After I *finally* convinced her that it was indeed off, she became apologetic and assured me that she was going to complain to her supplier and even offered me another Asahi and dessert, but I frankly think a restaurant should take full responsibility for what it serves, and this was too little too late.  She took the rotting ika and the never-even-arrived tuna off the bill (well, break out the champers!).  I feel like a bit of a sucker for paying for any of it at all, but by then I was already feeling awkward for having complained (I know it was a valid complaint, but it's still not nice when confrontation becomes necessary, especially when the staff make it more awkward than it ought to be), and I was ready to just high-tail it out of there.  If they were willing to serve me manky old squid and then try to defend it, who knows what other ickiness they would put on my table?  Confidence totally blown for me.      From 4 stars to 1 star in one fell swoop.  Sayonara, Sushi Loca!   :(",

It can start to get quite roudy at times with the chefs at the sushi bar whooping it up with the patrons sitting there. I'm all for people enjoying themselves, but seems to send the message that party goers are welcomed more than other types of paying customers. Plus all the noise can interfere with conversations you are trying to have with your family/friends.   Perhaps not the best environment for young children either (sushi wise), as the names on several of the rolls refer to actions taken with the genitalia. (Probably don't want to have sex ed IN the restaurant with your wee ones.)  Now don't get me wrong thinking I'm bashing the place. I'm not. Like I said, seems to be more for the partiers than family friendly.  All the rolls I've had are all awesome.  You are brought ought a salad dish which is very tasty. Can't remember the other dishes I've had here, but they definitely were good going down in my tummy.  Next time we go, may have to have a babysitter.",

    "text": "Generally when I go somewhere new,  especially for sushi, I leave with at least some type of memorable moment of the meal that allows me to write a review. This is not one of those times.  My only memories of Sushi Loca are the fact that it doesn't have an identity. It has the design and decor of a trendy upscale restaurant, with a menu that looks like it was written by a horny 15 year old boy. Some of the rolls have ridiculously perverted names for no reason. Oh, and they were playing 90's rock which just confused the shit out of me.  The food? As I mentioned before, it was less than memorable. My favorite part of the meal happened to be the free pre-meal sample of a cucmber salad that was really enjoyable. The sushi itself was fresh but the flavor combinations just seemed a bit confusing and overly ambitious. I'll stick to Naked Fish and Sen of Japan for my daring sushi choices.",

Went her for a girls night out, the waitress took a long time to come take our order and the restaurant was nearly empty on a Monday evening so there's no reason for her to take 20 minutes to take our order. We ordered our first round and it wasn't bad. We ordered our second round and one person in our party wasn't pleased with her roll and asked if she could get something else. At first the waitress said no then changed her mind, but counted how many pieces of sushi were on the plate. She had an attitude about it which we brushed off. Then when we asked for our bill we paid in cash she counted our money at the table as if we were not going to pay for our bill. Our waitress was rude the service we received today was not worth our patronage. We will not return, in this city there are plenty of sushi options so there is no need to return.",

Then a customer came in, and the sushi chef shook the customers hands with the gloves on that he made sushi with, then without washing or changing gloves, he went back to making sushi....it was discussing, and I'll NEVER GO BACK.",

I use to get complimentary edamame with my to-go order, not anymore. They must be getting really cheap, but the prices sure haven't dropped.

Half of the time, she can tell whether the sushi is fresh or not simply by looking at it.  So.....  She was gonna give it a 0 star if it was possible. She wanted some bento box and I wanted some sashimi really bad. We decided not to go to Sushi Koma or Sushi Goyemon, our to go sushi spot, but instead opting to try sushi Loca.   First of all, this place is Korean perhaps with Japanese owners. This is perfectly fine as Sushi Koma is Korean too. But omg my gf's bento box was horrendously bad. HORRENDOUSLY BAD! It doesn't look/taste/anything like a Japanese bento box. My girlfriend failed to eat even 1/4 of what was in it. It was just  fried chicken with absolutely no taste.   I had sashimi and nigiri. I would give it about 3 stars. Rice was definitely not to the standard of a good sushi spot. What's more crazy is my girlfriend thinks their tuna isn't really tuna. It tasted funny to me but I thought it was, we leave that to you to make the call. One thing though, I am a master scallop dude, their scallop was not fresh, period! Dried and tasteless.  I probably not gonna go back again. I rather drive 30 minutes to go to sushi Koma for fresher better sushi.",

I mean, why would you leave the noodles to sit in the broth and get all mushy and soft??     Will I come here again?  Maybe... but I wouldn't order the same bland tasting broth that should have more flavor and consistency of what a real Japanese Ramen broth should taste like.

The wrong sushi plates were delivered to our table (no big deal). Overall the food is good and you get it fast once you order it but the servers are not very attentive. We had to wave someone over again once we finished eating.   I will say the booths are nice, big and private and can seat 8 comfortably. Oh and I highly recommend the cherry blossom.

Ramen tasted very similar to instant ramen, chicken karage was obviously fried in over used oil, and needed more seasoning (there was no salt and pepper shakers on the table). We probably needed to try the sushi to see what the rants were really about. This is probably why we were only provided with one full menu and (5) sushi menus.   First time here and probably my last.   Good Luck Sushi Loca.",

Everything started out good we got in got seated and received our drinks and had our orders taken fairly quickly.        However, both food items that my mother and I received had HAIR in them. My sushi and her salad. They were clearly hair from two different people which made it that much more gross and as a worker in the food industry I understand the importance.        Then on top of that, after we received our food our server did not come back to check it on this the entire time and never did refill our drinks. She only offered after she saw that we were clearly ready to go with our plates stacked and our credit card out.  Normally I give them the benefit of the doubt but considering there were only two other tables in the restaurant I don't understand why she never came back. After both of these incidences I don't think I will be coming back anytime soon.",

I managed to squash it, and then placed it in my empty cucumber ramekin. I was slightly grossed out, while my wife was exceedingly grossed out (to the max-insert valley girl accent here.)   I handed the ramekin to the server, pointing out our visitor. He acknowledged the pest, but did not apologize, and left the table.   Our issue? Nobody ever came back to the table about this incident. No manager visit at all. Nothing.   I'd also like to point out that if you can see roaches in the front of the house, then there most certainly are roaches in the back of the house.   Sushi restaurants are a dime a dozen here. And while this is really close to our house, I find it highly unlikely we'll go back anytime soon.",

Their food is really good and I just discover their kake udon soup. It's in the cheaper side around $6-7 but it does not travel well. The sushi is amazing! Love the sushi loca special and the final fantasy 7. Beside price I really enjoy it!",

I had the strawberry mochi (sp?) and I've never had it before. I'm pretty sure I'm obsessed now. I like the atmosphere- music is a tad loud but that's okay since the tracks are good. Service is pretty good- a different person every time so I never knew who to ask for something in particular but you could always find a waitress. So it was pretty good. The menu has a vast array of options and the names are ridiculous. I love my ass? That was seriously the name of one of the dishes. Wtf?!  Kind of out of the way and I wouldn't have known about it without my friend who is from LV and lives near there. But it's a nice place in town.  I would definitely go here again!!!!!!",

So she brings the menu Im looking at the menu caked with old food and finger prints.... I pushed the menu away and just looked it up online... Order UNI and Hamachi  - UNI was good but the seaweed wrap wasnt wrapped correctly.... Hamachi fish was hard not good at all also the rice fell apart when I picked it up.  Not sure how in the world this place made it to a 4 star?  I stopped ordering after these 2 items. Just wanted to get out of there. Will never go back I have been to sushi bars around the world this place is substandard.... I approve this message J K KUHL...",

It is a True tribute to some of the more interesting parts of Japanese culture.   Food: I think the sushi is a little over done here. Maybe I should stop ordering the combos. But if you're looking for very traditional, basic sushi, you're not going to get that here. Everything is augmented 10 fold. I agree with John about the fives, this place is not a five. It is Vegas so how fresh can the sushi really be? (Remember...desert?) But it is not a 1. I would say this place is very good to introduce people to sushi, people that are anti-raw fish and are just getting in the mode. This is good for that because a lot of the insides are cooked. Bring a large group here, they can take it.",

I had my usual tuna hand rolls on soy paper, some other dishes. no real issues other than price. when I realized I had only order a few things for myself and I think 2 rolls for wifey and I to share and I was at $90 or so, I said no more.  comparing it to sushi koma, which I love, I just have to go towards that place moving forward. lt boils down to price and I did not notice any quality difference between a all you can eat style sushi place and this a la carte sushi spot.  this spot is good if your up in this area for sure, but the pricing is \"loco\" for what your getting, only reason I'm dropping it a star. just not worth the price paid for the product your getting.",

There is a roll called \"I love my ass.\" I incredulously asked my sister if  author Chuck Tingle wrote the names of these rolls. Google image search / search Buzzfeed for his book covers now & prepare to cry laughing.  We ended up with a spicy tuna roll topped with smelt (?) as well as karage, seaweed salad and 2 pieces of some foolery called something something ex wife and is sold by in pieces. DO NOT get it. Each piece consists of a raw jalapeno, sliced lengthwise, topped with cream cheese, chopped fish and then deep fried with eel sauce. Not good.  Karage was highlight of the meal. Service was good. Menu titles are sophomoric and out of place. We were still hungry after the $28 meal so we stopped for crackers, cheese and wine at Smith's on the way home.  Honestly, I think in general it might be better to come for their late night specials that begin at 11.",

    "text": "With not many Japanese options over here in the Centennial area - Sushi Loca is my savior. They have great deals on their lunch specials- for a little over $8.00 you get rice, salad, miso soup, gyoza, and 2 choices of either chicken karage, chicken,beef or salmon teriyaki, shrimp or veggie tempura or pork\\chicken katsu. I like the salad dressing here- it's like an orange ginger citrus dressing- Yummy!!! A real positive is that the chicken katsu is made with chicken breast- I just wish the chicken karage was made using chicken breast as well.... Last night the BF and I decided to try some sushi rolls- Taste like my ex-girlfriend, Jackpot and Japanese Lasagna #2 - All were yummy and filling.... The Japanese Lasagna #2 was only different from a regular Japanese Lasagna roll because they added scallops under all the gooey ooey eel sauce and cream cheese- Yeah Boy!!!!! Good Stuff!!!  ***So, here's a little tid bit for parents of kids who are of reading age  - pretty much all the rolls listed on the menu and the t-shirts of the sushi chefs all say phrases that leave kid's asking \"Why does it say that?\" So, be ready to honestly explain or pretty much lie - you're the parent , it's up tp you. But, they will ask!!!***  I like the decor in here - it's trendy but still comfortable. Thank Heavens Sushi Loca is near my work or I don't know what I would do....",

First things first, the sushi here didn't make me sick, so that's a plus!  I had the Spicy Crab roll and I found it to be very good, though it was a little lacking on the spicy part.   Some of the names they have for the sushi is hilarious, but be aware, this isn't a good place for kids, because the names are somewhat provocative. i.e. the Tates-Like-My-Ex-Girlfriend Roll.  I can see the humor in it, but your grandma might not.   They also have a vast selection of sake here too, but the bottle. I got the blueberry sparkling sake and it was delicious!  the waitresses and chefs were great and I would definitely come back here again!",

The restaurant wasn't that busy, and my daughter and I were seated right away at the sushi bar. We were given a nice size portion of edemame and cucumber salad. We ordered 3 rolls that I have to admit were Delish! We had the Caterpillar roll, the Final Fantasy 1 roll and a Rainbow roll. I was astounded to see the size of the fish pieces on top of the Rainbow roll, they were huge! All of the fish tasted very fresh. The Final Fantasy 1 is just that....a fantasy, or maybe a dream in which my taste buds were in heaven! It came with a spicy ponzu/mayo sauce that was new to me, but so delicious. It had the spicy flavor of regular garlic ponzu with an added creaminess of the mayo.   The only reason I am holding back 1 star is because we had to ask for our check. The waitress, once she brought us our drinks, disappeared, without even a return trip for a refill or anything.   I will definitely return to Sushi Loca. I'm glad I gave them a second chance!",

I know a lot of sushi purists will not like this place.  The sushi is basically geared towards well... you know -- round eyes.  It's kinda your sub-urban sushi place, but like I said they do a good a job.    They do have lewd names for some of the rolls there... kinda obnoxious... but hey.

I got the Salmon roll, a fresh and tasty treat while my mom got the Spicy Crab roll- whoa, way good!  They give you a huge mound of tangy ginger and wasabi, but they do not have a low sodium soy sauce option, at least not at the table.  They have five desserts to choose from, awesome since most places I have been to only have about two or three.  Can't wait to go back ad try a tempura roll!",

The point is, the here at Sushi Loca are so awesome and do our orders as asked and I couldn't be happier. I love the chole wrap or something. It's a spicy crab roll but rolled with cucumber instead of rice. FANTASTIC!!!!",

    "text": "It's in my hood, but never tried it until now. They recently have extended their hours on some nights to 2am so we went for some late noshing.   They have a roll menu, a full menu, a late night menu so we ordered something from each.   Tako Yaki from the late night ($4.95, 5 pcs)- the batter was great, crisp outside and the inside has a soft gooey consistency but not mushy. There is a big problem though- where was the tako? My first ball had none at all. The second did but it was small and same with the following balls. I took a picture to show you the biggest piece of tako I got next to the size of the ball. Just sayin' it's not crispy balls of dough, it's key word is tako so if you make it, please put it in. Shame,  their batter texture is spot on.   Final Fantasy 2 roll (inside- spicy soft shell crab, tempura, cucumber. outside is more spicy soft shell crab and mixed fish- $12.95) as you can see from the pic, the roll is pretty filled. It was good, but it wasn't a \"fantasy\". I appreciate the sauce was a happy medium between a light ponzu and spicy mayo sauce and served on the side so the roll doesnt sog.   Hibachi Beef ($13.95)- diced ribeye with zucchini, mushrooms and onions on a sizzling plate w/ a citrus sauce. The meat was good, soft and juicy and veggies were fresh. Came with rice, miso soup-a tad salty for me, and salad- good dressing thats a cross between ginger dressing and thousand island but the greens were swimming in it.  The service was pretty good.   The look of the place is very cool, nicely decorated, but the ambiance isn't quite there because of how dirty the booth is. I put a picture up of the wall next to me with black smudges. It's probably stupid kids getting a hold of the sushi menu pencils they leave on the table with stupid parents who don't know how to keep their kids proper, but you should clean that up. Also, the booth is a cool color of microsuede, but the problem with that is you get it smudged and it looks so dirty....there was caked on sauce smudge at the end of the booth where the BF was sitting. I was gonna get a picture, but I didn't need my flash to go off under the table and making me ousted since were the only people left before closing. Sure, I've eaten at dives, hole in the walls that are grimy but if you have this nice of a place I would think maintaining it's nice character should be a given.  The food was good, but nothing I would say set this above and beyond other sushi spots....A-OK food. New Years Eve just past, I did my deep cleaning but Loca didn't. BF and I agreed that 3 stars is being very fair.",

For recs you should start with the hoshiusagi sake (Star Rabbit), which is a smooth tasting sparkling sake (and be careful cuz if you get too comfortable, it will get you!). For rolls I tried the \"crazy horse\" (a tempura roll with baked salmon, cream cheese and cucumber) and the \"oooops she was 17\" (a baked roll with salmon green onions and jalapenos; aka one of the best rolls I have tried!!). My wife and her brother tried other rolls and they have the same great experience that I did. So if you are looking for good sushi, good ambience and a great experience, go to Sushi Loca!

But, my experience tonight, in combination with other recent reviews, leads me to wonder about the future of Sushi Loca. We entered the establishment at 10 pm on a Saturday and encountered a low energy vibe (low music, an absence of the traditional loud, jovial greetings).  We placed our order. Thirty minutes later, still no food.  After seeing food served to several tables around us who had arrived after we did, we asked our waitress about our missing food.  She didn't really give us a response but simply said, \"Oh yes, it is coming out.\"  When it did arrive, only half of the items that we ordered were served.  She later corrected the mistake but never apologized. My husband and I concluded that she simply lost the order. In short, food is decent.  But service and vibe is below average.  I don't know if we will be returning again.",

They're priced a little higher, but they're worth it.        - Non-sushi - From the limited I tried, I wouldn't bother.        - Chinese - Other than Ohjah, I think this is only the second Chinese run sushi place. Most are run by Koreans. **Ordered**        - $12.95 Final Fantasy 2 - Assorted fish wrapped in shrimp tempura and spicy soft shell crab crumbles with a dipping sauce. This was the roll they suggested, and it's the only reason I'm giving this place a passing mark. It was one of the best rolls I've had. I really like how you can dip the sushi yourself to control how much ponzu sauce you like. (<a href=\"http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/sushi-loca-las-vegas?select=x1CV1RcERUTAxN0Vru3TlA#x1CV1RcERUTAxN0Vru3TlA\">yelp.com/biz_photos/sush...</a>)        - $9.95 Dynamite - Shrimp/scallop/mushroom/rice cake slices based over rice. It was nice that the shrimp and scallops were pieces from a larger shrimp/scallop unlike other places that give you mini scallops. However, there seemed to be about 3 or 4 slices of scallop compared to the 15-20 slices of rice cake. Also, this is probably the first time I had Dynamite ontop of rice. I assumed the rice was there to fill space? (<a href=\"http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/sushi-loca-las-vegas?select=qOBq-CHIQRMxSiF0BJZ0Pw#qOBq-CHIQRMxSiF0BJZ0Pw\">yelp.com/biz_photos/sush...</a>)        - $9.95 Lunch Special - You pick two items with soup/salad/rice/goyoza. I got the Beef Teriyaki and Chicken Karage. The beef was in a sliced steak form, but a little think. The chicken was breaded too much for my taste and lacked flavor. The ginger/garlic flavor was too mild and I ended up dipping the chicken in my teriyaki sauce. Overall, a good deal, but definitely not getting the Karage next time. (<a href=\"http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/sushi-loca-las-vegas?select=Z_nsPce_4do4YAK5Vqo6tw#Z_nsPce_4do4YAK5Vqo6tw\">yelp.com/biz_photos/sush...</a>)        - $9.95 Beef Yakisoba - Noodles were thinner than I expected and it was lacking flavor. I'm ashamed to say it, but this was the first time I had to pour soy sauce on my noodles. Furthermore, you can see from the picture there's almost no beef slices in the dish. (<a href=\"http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/sushi-loca-las-vegas?select=i0lPvmbwWCMZwhQ5P2wY2w#i0lPvmbwWCMZwhQ5P2wY2w\">yelp.com/biz_photos/sush...</a>) **Recommendations**        - I'm hesitant to recommend this place. The non-sushi I tried was not impressive but the sushi rolls are delicious.",

With that being said, I thought it was about time to roam around the area to find restaurants I have not eaten at yet. Sadly, Summerlin is plagued by chain restaurants galore. Good thing Centennial and Providence are starting to develop up.   Sushi Loca is not an AYCE place, but they do give generous cuts on their fish. The restaurant looked to be packed after a few moments of walking in. Luckily, we avoided the mad rush in and were seated promptly.   Even though it was my first time here. I ordered sushi like I was at my regular haunts. I threw out orders like hirame with jalapeno, tako with a lemon slice, and it was all prepared decently well. My only complaint is the overuse of sauce. Sometimes less is more. The texture of the rice is good. I can't speak about the flavor since most of it was overdressed. The fish were all delicious. With how busy they are, the turn over must be quick.",

Spicy roll was pretty good but not the best I've had.  Hibachi combo dish was ok--meaning it was more like a fajita dish than a Japanese hibachi BBQ dish.  It was not bad, just not what we expected in a Japanese resto.  The comparable restaurant Sushi Tachi in NLV is better in our opinion.   Also,  the service at Sushi Loca wasn't that attentive,  our drinks were empty and in most Japanese restos the drinks don't go down halfway before someone asks if you want more to drink.",

    "text": "Little skeptical about sushi restaurants in North Las Vegas area, but I must say I was pleasantly surprised by this place.  The music is lively (borderline clubbing music) and there's an upbeat atmosphere especially on the weekends.    They start off by giving you free cucumber salad (sumonono) and edamame! And the rolls are GINORMOUS, so you definitely are not overpaying for rolls if you think the prices are a little steep when you first look at the menu!!  The rolls are actually more creative than most places...  Some stand out rolls were the oh my god roll...which has assorted seafood mixed with mochi (rice cake) on top! The other roll that stood out was the elvis roll with a yogurt sauce on top of seared salmon.  I think the only roll I wasn't too pleased with was the Neptune Dazzler...sounded good...but was drowned in a sauce to the point the rice was falling apart.     I haven't had a chance to try the sushi, but i saw the chefs prepping it and there are definitely large generous portions of fish.  Definitely a go to spot for people who live in the north and northwest area!",

Also, both the waitress and hostess were rude and slow to serve.  However, I am one who believes in second chances.  Months later, I went in a second time where we sat at the sushi bar for our meal.  We got our first couple of rolls, and as I started eating a cockroach crawled by me on the counter.  It then crawled over the glass barrier to where the raw fish is kept (the same fish they served me).  Not wanting to make a scene, I called the sushi chef over and pointed out the bug.  He immediately squished it like it was nothing and apologized.  Our appetites were pretty destroyed after this, but trying to be forgiving and polite, we finished our food and asked for the check.  They brought us the check for full price and did not compensate us for what had happened, although the waitress did apologize when she brought the check.  Being frequent sushi eaters, I will say I have never been so disgusted.  Sushi Loca customers, beware.  We should have left the moment we saw that cockroach crawl by my plate, but we tried to ride it out.  This I regret.",

I ordered the beef sukiyaki and the combination hibachi. First the sukiyaki did not really taste like authentic sukiyaki. The meat they put was so little that it looked like scraps from another dish. The noodles were also cut really short like 3-4 inches long. The vegetables were too cooked also. It really doesn't taste like sukiyaki. Then there was no egg with it. When I asked the server, instead of asking the chef if we can add or make it an option, she grabbed a menu and read it, then she says there's no egg that comes with it. I said but doesn't sukiyaki comes with egg? She says not here we don't do egg. I said but sukiyaki always comes with that option and she says I'm sorry I don't know, I'm Thai and I don't know what it is like. I asked another server if we can make it an added on and she says , sorry we don't put egg . It's very disappointing. Their hibachi is also too greasy. The shrimp was not fresh and it looked like it was fried from frozen.  This definitely is not a place I'll come back to. The servers were also so engrossed in hurrying up and cleaning. Poor customer service. I beg the owners to please try the food. I'm asian so I know what it tastes like. I wanted to ask them if the chef was at least asian but they were kinda rude.     I'm sorry for this bad review but if the management doesn't check the menu and revise the the cooking, this will never be a good Japanese restaurant. It will be like an American asian place like Panda Express .",

In fact, this is probably the only place that has NEVER disappointed me when it comes to the food and environment. It's comfortable and cozy and the food has always been very fresh and very tasty. I especially like the small cucumber salad they bring you as an appetizer. The reason for the five stars though is because in the past eight years I can only think of one time that the staff left a lasting impression on me...my ex BF and I walked in and felt so welcomed by the staff at the bar that it was probably THE reason why I've continued going back all these years. This past time I went in there really was none of that...no welcome or friendly small talk before our order was taken or goodbye as we left. Don't get me wrong...I will be back...but the customer service should be a bit more welcoming :)",

    "text": "Good place on the north side of town. The standard rolls are all present... Cali, Philly, Spicy tuna, Salmon skin, and others. There are lots of specialty rolls which is nice, but there aren't many that don't contain some kind of extra calories, whether it's tempura, avocado, or cream cheese. Normally that's fine, but there aren't a lot of lighter options to balance it out. Also, almost every specialty roll comes with something spicy in it. Again, not always a bad thing but when I take guests their options can become limited. On the flip side, if you are looking for something like I described, this place is great. The \"Who's your ex-wife\" is basically a fantastic tempura jalepeno popper.  The other stuff on the menu is also pretty standard Japanese fare.  Yakitori and teriyaki, ramen and miso. My wife loves the Cha-shu ramen in particular. I don't really like miso but there are a few places that do it really well and this is one of them.   There is always lots of staff which is good when this place gets hopping during the dinner rush. Clean with plenty of seating as well, though it may be limited for large groups.",

It was.. alright. Nothing special & I've definitely had better. I ordered the Sizzling Beef Hibachi.. which was definitely not sizzling when it got to our table. Actually, it wasn't even warm, except for the rice. Also, my supposed-to-be sizzling plate barely had meat. I'm sure I didn't order Veggie Hibachi. Sigh.

I haven't tried their rolls but their nigiri sushi are good. Soft shell crab appetizer is recommended as well.   If you are looking for a good, casual sushi, I recommend this place.",

Our bill was then messed up and we had to wait another 30 minutes, at least, in order for our waitress to correct it and then another 15 minutes for our change. We will not be dining here anymore and I don't recommend this to anyone. I work in a restaurant and this is the worst service I have ever experienced. Very disappointed.",

The Katsu was delicious. Karage was real chewy..like rubbery...and the chicken didn't taste too good, almost like it wasn't fully cooked. We told our waitress towards the end of our meal (which we still had the full position of karage still on her plate).  The waitress said sorry there's nothing we can do. Didn't apologize, didn't offer to replace...well actually she said if I told her earlier she would taken it back and re-cooked it.  That doesn't sound appetizing to me!!! Disappointed. Btw I always get screaming o and ttl.  Today I got ttl and xxx. Neither disappointed..both were yummy!!!!  I'm disappointed in how they handled our lunch box though.  Oh!! Also, I got hot tea and asked for refill..I inadvertently removed the tea bag prior (it's a habit, I don't like my tea too strong so I always remove after a while)...she took my cup and brought me back hot water! No tea bag!  When I asked for one she seem annoyed!  Hope they do better next time...would be sad to have to go to my 2nd fave sushi spot instead",

Pro - relatively quick service - sushi....prepared better than most places  Cons - miso soup....cool to the taste! - hot green tea....room temperature! - tempura udon noodle soup....tap water warm and seemed like tempura was previously cooked(frozen?!?) and then warmed up - steamed rice....room temperature  - music....EXCEPTIONALLY loud!!!!  Could not have had a conversation with the person sitting across from you in the booth.  Asked them nicely to turn it down even a little and it didn't matter to them one iota - air conditioning....set for the workers and not the patrons---jacket/sweater worthy conditions  This is the last ever visit to sushi Loca as its worth driving to a place that truly cares about its customers and not just the bottom line.  It's too bad because there are very, very few sushi places on the north/northwest side of town.",

Got a table really quickly and didn't have to wait around for the server to take the table's orders. I definitely give them 5 stars for their service. The yakisoba tasted a bit off to me, so I asked if I could exchange it for something else and the manager came over and said that was alright. Needless to say, service is amazing and the people are very friendly. I will likely stick to other places though.",

Yes, ladies, you know we went All Night Long; Yup, 3 hours non-stop! It was so good I had to tell babe, \"Look, lets 68 and I owe you one, HA!\" Holy Cow, what a night! It was such a Hot Night that he was making all my fantasies come True. We started with Final Fantasy 1 and went all the way to Final Fantasy #2; baybee, all natural Viagra. Oh My God!, Ladies, it was like having sex on the Beach! I can bet you Megabucks that he will be back!   Alright, Alright--Keep Calm! This was the crazy dream that I had after having all those exotic sushi rolls. What a fun restaurant to come and experience, such a wonderful vibe to chill and have lunch/dinner! The inside decor of the restaurant is very spacious and cute; located in a huge shopping plaza with several different stores to choose from. We were quickly greeted upon walking in and was handed a menu. The menu was quite overwhelming, but fun to explore. My group and I decided to try many of the exotic sushi rolls (where most of those exotic names were listed at the beginning of the review), and they were ALL pretty damn good!   This is a little way out of Downtown Las Vegas, but if you are looking for a wonderful sushi experience, then this is the place to come and check out!   I was hoping to try the sake bombs but didn't get to this time around. My all-time favorite sushi roll was the All Night Long; so delicious! I will definitely be back when in Vegas! One of the BEST sushi restaurants that I have ever tried.   Trust me, you don't want to miss out on this wild experience!",

The menu is a riot- everything has crazy names and it's a kick to place your order with a red face.    From the outside, this looks like just another strip mall sushi joint but you will be pleasantly surprised when you walk inside.  It drips ambiance and has that \"fancy sushi place\" atmosphere nailed.  The honey roll is a favorite of mine. Absolutely divine.  There are plenty of options though- even for those who are not huge sushi fans (I hear there are some but I don't know them.)   I looooove the huge booths- feel free to bring a party with you.    Service here is always pleasant and consistent.  It's not a speedy place, so do come when you have time for a leisurely dining experience.  Also, try to avoid the dinner rush; come early or come late, and if you happen to be around over Valentine's day, the decorations will definitely put a smile on your girl's face :)",

If we end up in here, cool.. if not, it's nothing my palate will be crying and whining to me about. The ahi was more like a spicy pate..We ordered the simple but satisfying Tiger roll, cause that's just how we typically roll; shrimp tempura, spicy ahi, unagi sauce, maybe throw in some avo or cucumber&we call it a soosh day (yo!

We were there to celebrate my daughters birthday and it turned out to be a flop. The food was awful. My husband got tuna hand rolls and they literally like cat food and had absolutely no flavor. The sushi rolls had more crab meat than anything else. And the green tea was basically all watered down with no flavor either. My co workers did recommend this place to me but I've had way better sushi. Will definitely not be going back again. Then to top it off the waitress took like over 20 minutes to bring my daughter her birthday ice cream. She figured we had already paid our bill and her tip was guaranteed so why bother looking our way or even making eye contact. My husband had to practically flag her down just to get her attention. Lastly the manager did nothing for us either. Total disappointment!!",

As we opened the door there was no one at the front, only a man in the sushi bar area. We saw one other couple sitting there with drinks. So we assumed we should just sit at the bar. The man didn't say anything until we pulled out our chairs to order. He mumbled something. I asked him what he said. \"Last call was already called,\" he repeated. I looked at my phone 11:15pm and my husband asked if they were still open, that Yelp said midnight. Guess that was a lie. He didn't apologize and we just walked back into the stench. We will never return. I wish Vegas had more late night sushi places in the North. They could take notes from places like Sushi Sumo II.",

While this isn't my normal sushi order (I love ahi-tuna however that is not preggers friendly) I was very happy with the taste. My husband had the chicken teriyaki plate and some chicken katsu. He raved about how great it tasted. I believe the prices are reasonable. They have a debit card minimum of 10 dollars (so heads up!)

    "text": "Sadly, the only impressive dish we had today at lunch was the edamame, and frankly, that's a stretch. Either serve it cold or warm, not somewhere in between.   Our appetizers came out in an odd, piecemeal fashion - sauce with no tempura veggies, appetizers after the meal had been served.   We were told the lunch special is not available on the weekend, which is fine. As long as you state that one the website. Check it out - there's no restriction listed, just a time frame.   When we finally received the entrees, they all came out minutes apart, and did not impress. The katsus, both chicken and pork, were dry and nearly inedible without the sauce. Surprisingly, the katsu sauce was deliciously tangy and sweet. The yakisoba was horribly over done. For a dish that warns the meat could be potentially undercooked, it was a bit ironic to be served something more like hockey puck than bovine.   I can understand every restaurant has an off day, but to have the horrible service (getting sneered at for spilling a few drops of soy sauce, and the fact that I've been waiting 20 min now to get the check) that accompanied this lackluster meal, has made a long-time fan into a customer who probably won't return.",

Food was mediocre service was very bad ,  So I get there and there must of been maybe 10 people , I basicly had to sit myself no one helped me, I order the first roll burning desire  4/5 pricey but it tasted ok over all , I then ordered mucho grande the batter  was not very cryspy  I would give this roll 2/5 1 star for the presentation was decent  also expensive roll for what it was , then I overhear a conversation from two people  sitting next to me and they where not happy with their order they told her they dint like it and only try a small piece of the roll and where asking to return it , the server reply  \"we still going to charge you for it might as well you eat it \"  I was shocked   I understand charging steep a la carte  prices but when they give you huge rice rolls with barley any fish that's disappointing, I rather go eat at a cheap all you can eat for that.   It might seem harsh that I gave this place 2 star but if you look at what they charge ,  I spent 55$  got 2 beers and 2 rolls , I expected the rolls to be something I couldn't get at an ayce sushi restaurant.",

    "text": "9:30pm on a Saturday we came in with a group of friends.  Apparently because it was later in the evening (they close at 11) the mad rush before us wore them out and their energy level was at an all time low based on our past experiences.    First off the mood of the place wasn't as it usually was.  The music was down low (which usually is so bumpin by this time of night) and there wasnt any loud exciting greetings when we walked in the door as we have always had in the past. There were still quite a few people there being that it was later in the night which dwendled down the longer we were there.    We asked at the beginning that we have the bill separated accordingly which they said wasnt a problem.  We ordered some drinks and then ordered our first round of rolls etc.  The food came out timely.  Our first round of food was done and the plates occupied the whole middle of the table the rest of the time we were there chatting and finishing our drinks.  We would have loved to put some more orders in however the servers were MIA.  This was a big bummer because I was still hungry!!!  Grrr.  When the bill came out it wasnt separated as discussed in the beginning.  Not to mention we didnt realize till we saw the bill that there were things we ordered that we never received but were charged for.  Carazay.  lol   So another 15 minutes trying to separate what everyone ordered and deleting the orders that we didnt receive etc...still all while the pile of dishes took up most the table.  My added pic says it all.  Between all of us we all ordered a little bit of everything so too much to remember.  But there were no complaints about the food other than we didnt get all of what we ordered and we were still hungry.  The service is huge for this place though.  I've always thought the service made this place stand out from the others and maybe it was an off night for the crew.  Hopefully the next time I can put this back on the 4-5 stars which is expected.  The only reason for the 3 starts is their food is good!  And the past experiences have been good ones.  I'm hoping that the next visit will overshadow that last.",

The staff was very kind and attentive to us. They offered suggestions when we asked, and were overall fabulous!  The sushi was just fantastic. Me and my friend split three rolls (we came later in the evening) We shared an eel roll, the Volcano roll, and the I Did Your Girlfriend. Every single one was fresh, and made right in front of us. We couldn't get enough of the Volcano roll!  We'll be back again, and again and again!",

    "text": "I'm going to go with a solid 'meh' on this one.  Judging from the lunch menu by the way.  Dipped in here to satisfy a curiosity of this place as i have been living in the area for over a year and still haven't tried it out. Between Sam's Club for pizza and hot-dogs for a cheap meal or be adventurous and try out the sushi joint for lunch this was chosen and here are the results:  Two options for the lunch special both ehhh under 12 bucks. One is set up bento box style the other being the sushi special which i assume you get rolls or something. Grabbed the box option.   Salmon Teriyaki Remember when Teriyaki ment a cooking technique where something is broiled and grilled with a glaze of soy sauce, marin, and sugar? Pepperidge Farms remembers... Very bland and tasteless. Couldn't taste any of the grill flavor. Forget about the salmon flavor that's long gone after being popped freezer to freezer to freezer.  Why did i get salmon? Figured a restaurant that specializes in fish is able to pull off a tasty grilled fish entree. Same reason i would order a milk shake at an ice cream parlor.   Tonkatsu The best thing about this tonkatsu is the sauce which is most likely bottled. The breading failed to stay on the pork except for the end pieces. When i picked up a strip and dipped it into the sauce the breading broke off at the point where i was applying pressure with my chopsticks and fell into the sauce. The meat under was white the hair of the undead white walkers far beyond the wall...the north remembers...  The Rest The rice was slightly too moist, the salad had too much dressing that was poured on top instead of evenly dispersed throughout and tasted too much of mayo, ginger and a touch of thousand island. Best thing in the box was the Gyoza which was perfectly crispy on the outside and flavorful and juicy on the inside.  The Bill Need to spend 20 quid to use plastic...good thing i got a hand roll then!  Spicy Yellowtail Handroll I LOVE spicy yellowtail hand rolls. To me they are a window into the fundamentals of the place. An instrument to measure amounts of fucks given if you will. Once i received a YT hand roll that was nothing more then thick chunks of yellow tail, cucumber slivers, sprouts, and a moderate amount of rice and was rolled so perfectly nothing dripped out of the bottom. What i received here came less than 5 minutes after i placed the order. The amount of rice and...yellow tail i guess was WAY off, too much of both. First bite revealed what my eyes were trying to tell me. The spicy yellow tail...spread was pre-made. No texture, no flavor, no spicy.  This dining experience honestly wasn't all that great and i knew this going in. Still went in just to afford the oportunity to be 'wow'ed'. It didn't happen.   Now if you're reading this review trying to decide if you should go here for dinner or if you should go here at all i would like to thank you for reading this far and highly consider skipping mine and read another review. Here's why: There's two kinds of sushi places for two kinds of sushi eaters: The Rolls and The Raw. I am a raw eater. I love nothing more than to pay all you can eat prices and gouge on all the sea urchin, tuna, surf clam, and mackerel i can get my greedy paws on. This place is a Roll place...Is it a good roll place? I dont know, i dont eat rolls.",

And the names for their rolls are hilarious and a bit dirty (if you have a poor sense of humor or are easily offended, don't go). For example my favorite so far is \"Tastes like my ex Girlfriend\". Well for us younger folks it's amusing.  Anyways so far I've loved everything I've eaten here. Service is friendly and I have never had to wait long to be seated. Atmosphere is nice as well.   No they do not have AYCE but their portions for their rolls are really great. I'm saying they are pretty huge. Especially the tempura or crunch rolls. So it's fine to me. Only reason it's a 4 instead of a 5 star is because the service is friendly, but often my sister and I would be stuck waiting for service. They seem understaffed. Not the staffs fault but the restaurant needs more people or something.  Still love this place though!!!",

    "text": "We found this restaurant through CitySearch and noticed the rave reviews. Being a foodie, I decided to check it out the other night. Where I live in Vegas, it's a 9 minute drive on the freeway, so it's close. It's also located in a very nice area of town, which brought my hopes up. Going with a previous review stating that this was better than Nobu--which honestly did not impress me when I went last week--I wanted to see what an off strip Sushi bar could offer.  Walking into the place, you feel like you've steped into a posh Japanese sushi bar. The colors and layout is fantastic, and there are at least four sushi chefs on hand at all times. I loved the menu offerings, from cold and hot appetizers to the infamous hibachi and bento boxes. As any great sushi bar will have, they offer the Americanized rolls but have a beautiful variety of sushi to order. We ordered the Man dai sushi (Japanese snapper) and garlic tuna sushi, along with shrimp & vegetable tempura appetizer, beef teriyaki (cut up ribeye) appetizer, fried gyoza, Nobu special roll, and yellowtail jalapeno sashimi (which they offer at Nobu for three times the price).  I have to say that as a person who grew up on a Pacific Island and having access to authentic Asia cuisine, including breathtaking Japanese sushi chefs and their culinary expertise, this place ranks on my top five places in Las Vegas to go for sushi. Not only were the flavors beautiful and clean, but their service was impeccable, their servers dressed (the women only) in kimonos which added to the authenticity of the restaurant, and the traditional Japanese greetings coming in and leaving. Add on the experience with honest-to-god beautiful and very delictable Japanese cuisines, and you have yourself a fantastic restaurant off the strip that is much better than what the hotels have to offer.  I know some people may think that I am exxagerating, but you have to try it to understand the beauty in their food.",

The atmosphere was great, and chefs entertaining. I was greeted with edamame and a small cucumber salad which is a plus. The sushi menu has a lot of specialty rolls to choose from...after 8 minutes of continuous reading,  I realized most of their rolls contained the same things over and over with a little difference???? I ordered the Double Down which wasn't bad....presentation wasnt impressive at all.  After a 5th look at the menu, I decided to customize my 2nd roll due to the lack of variety inside their rolls.  Overall, this place wasn't too bad and I give it props for the atmosphere and service. Price was on par with the rest of the valley.",

You are welcomed by every staff member as soon as you walk into the restaurant. What I really enjoy is how fast our service was. As soon as we sat down we were brought a nice and refreshing cucumber salad. It was small and a great start. If there was one thing that turns me off with this sushi restaurant is the noise. It was and always is LOUD. The music is played way to loud,so everyone has to talk loud to be heard. I had the heart attack roll and it tasted really good,but would fall apart every time I picked it up. Minor inconvenience. Overall I still believe this is the best sushi restaurant in the northwest.",

    "text": "Doesn't sound like a traditional Japanese name for a sushi restaurant does it?  You may be expecting some type of Japanese-Mexican fusion right? Wrong. When you walk in it's farrrrrrr from commerical.  Sushi Loca has got to be one of the most authentic Japanese sushi restaurants I've ever been to.  The servers are dressed up in traditional Japanese gear and the sushi chefs are so incredibly friendly and fun that it makes you want to be a regular there all the time.    Most recommended roll: Fat Ass Roll --what? what was that?  Did you just say \"Fat Ass\"?  Will it make me fat?  Well, quite possibly so but with something like this in your mouth you'll be screaming-- \"fatten me up baby!\"  Hey, how ever many fat ass rolls you indulge is entirely up to you.  But I promise that you will never taste a sushi like this more delicious in your life.  I'd describe what's in it but honestly with something like this in your mouth, do I really need to?  Just trust me.  I've abandoned my Lion King roll all together and I'm cheating on it with the Fat Ass roll.  That is how serious of a relationship I have with this Mr. Fat Ass.  Their fish is so fresh it makes you wonder, \"how the heck did they get such fresh fish to the Las Vegas desert?\"  We found out that they get a fresh shipment flown over daily and delivered from Hawaii, Asia and all the yummy places you expect fresh fish to come from.  All their rolls are excellent...they even make boring California rolls a delicious art.  Everything from their edamame  to the fresh oranges they give you after your meal.  Ask for Jack--he's our favorite sushi chef-sters.  If you are in the North Las Vegas area, it would be a shame if you don't stop by this place and give a warm \"Arigato\" for their excellent roll-o's.  We became instant regulars.  Friday nights are crazy, fun.  Music, sushi-chef performances and fun crowds.",

I am a purist, and focus on the core of sushi, the quality of the fish. I feel like fancy rolls are like ordering hamburgers at a steak house. Sushi Loca's fish is pretty damn good. Their Nigiri, rectangular fish and rice, is top notch. They also had Japanese sides I did not expect to find outside of a Japanese hub. Shiso, fresh wasabi (packaged but the real stuff), daikon, and Orion beer (Okinawan). Also their Toro was delicious. As good as Ive had in Tokyo. Served with the special care that Toro deserves. Service is great. It has become my go to place for my sushi fix.",

He also got a specialty roll, didn't get the name was great as well. My only problem is that the specialty rolls are so big and can't eat them in one bite, so they fall apart, oh and had to let my salmon sashimi warm up, it was extremely chilled. But that's more of a preference for me. Some of the best sushi I've had, wish there was one similar to where I live. Though I do have a tendency to stay away from more americanized sushi, it's what it's known for and for good reason.",

No joke I gave it so many tries and it just seems like this place is just slowly down grading itself.  I knew service was bad here but I figured maybe give it another go.  :( Man was that a bad Idea.   I order a spicy yellowtail roll and a eel  bento entree. My date order the salmon collar app and a beef hibachi entree. So we knew collars take forever to come out so we ordered that first before even deciding what entrees we wanted. So the spicy yellowtail came out, and man that thing was the ugliest sushi I've ever seen. It was so half-ass made. The rice wasn't even sticking together the fish look so odd o.O it felt like a gamble to eat.  So then we got our soups that comes with the entree and I didn't even get to take a sip of it and my entree came out super fast and my date is left waiting for his for about 7 mins or so and I had to starting eating my food before it got cold. Now, were basically almost done eating and our collar never came. So I ask about how much longer, she had the balls to say I never ordered it! Are you serious that was the first thing I ordered after the drinks.  And surprisingly it's nothing new they forgot my beer before and didn't even remember till I was done eating AND I had to ask for myself.  This place needs some serious 9-1-1 server training!  I don't think I'm ever coming back again.   I was so mad I was just like give me the check already.",

I love a lot of the newer rolls with jalapeno, cream cheese, baked mayo etc..... and this place does them really well along with traditional cut rolls.    Their japanese dinners, with steak and chicken katsu are great as well.",

A very welcoming feeling. Ordered the lychee saki cold.. It came out in a wine bottle. It was soo good chilled!! Took notes to purchase additional for the house (:   Order beef yokisoba(?) noodles, teriyaki beef, no pain no gain rolls, garake(?) chicken and I think it may have been the one night stand(?) rolls. Everything was delicious and the portions were very generous for a sushi house. I would not order the garake(?) chicekn again though. It was dried fried chicken over a bed of shreded cabbage -was not very enticing.   Great restaurant, atmostphere, service, food!! 5 stars is a mos def. Their late hours are great! Hard to find something that opens that late w/ great food off the strip. Will be taking family and friends back (:",

    "text": "I am impressed with my first encounter at Sushi Loca, and I only ordered to-go!  I was house sitting in Centennial area and had to get my sushi fix for dinner. This is definitely the place to try.  I ordered online using their phone app, nice and easy.  I left the house right after ordering and figured I'd wait a little bit at the restaurant to pick up the food.  Everything was ready as I arrived, 10 minutes tops and they had steady business inside!  Their fast to-go service blew my mind.  My only nitpick is to show the food during pickup, to ensure accuracy. I checked before I left so all was well.  Most important, the food was delicious and fresh. I ordered some nigiri, and two rolls. Sushi Loca is very attentive with boxing up the items and setting up the to-go bag (which is very important to me).  The salmon and yellowtail nigiri was fresh, with a good fish/rice ratio. The Final Fantasy roll was good, and the Natural Viagra was my favorite. Interesting name, I can't pass up smelt eggs on a roll!  I look forward to dining in, especially at the new location in Downtown Summerlin. :)",

They place more electronic/dance music which is a nice change to your typical sushi place.   The rolls all look fantastic and have some more risque names.  See the menu.  Fantastic kid's menu (strange way to judge a dining place but you wouldn't believe how many chicken strips/ mac and cheese you run into on the menu).  The one thing I didn't see was a bento box which was strange to me.  Maybe just missing the page it's on. Almost every place has that.  Prices are fairly reasonable for the type of food.

This was such a disrespectful, juvenile, offensive act that I will never return. I've been eating here 3 or 4 times a month for 7 years, so this is no small decision.   Eating LUNCH AT 11:45AM and blaring over the speakers of the restaurant is the song (I don't give a F) uncensored version. Kids are walking into this place with Mom and Grandma at this time. Childish BS like this has no place in a public establishment, and certainly not for a lunch crowd. After 10pm if you have no class, fine, but at lunch with kids. This is lewd behavior, and it shows poor judgment and a lack of respect. Innuendo in the menu is one thing, gross lewdness is another. I'm reporting this to Clark County Treasurer (business license division), I'm also sending a letter to each of the Clark County Commissioners. I'm also sending a letter to Steve Wolfson regarding this incident. Poor judgment like this makes you wonder what else  (they don't give a F about)",

We were one of those annoying tables that needed our check split multiple ways and didn't tell them initially. They were very nice about it all.   I dropped a star because the tempura box was just a bit too greasy. The flavor and overall taste of everything was great though! I also had the \"I Like My Ass\" roll and really liked it. I'm picky when it comes to sushi; I'm still a sushi amateur.   They gave the birthday boy a tempura ice cream and played the funniest Happy Birthday song over the speakers! Then a couple minutes later, another table had a birthday! It was a hilarious moment!  Sushi Loca is a great option for sushi in the Centennial Hills area. Fun music, too!",

Ok if i go to a pay per roll place Id better get a decent sized roll with fish in it. What we were just served was a ball of rice covered in sauce that paled in comparison to an all you can eat roll. When we made mention to the chef that there was no crab in a roll thats supposed to have it, he made an excuse that there was just a little bit so the could roll it. I looked at him like really this is one skimpy roll thats just pathetic. We asked for a little crab on the side to compensate and he refused... Check please! We are gone. Go to Sushi Burrito places like Poke or Ja Burrito like we are from now on, sure theres a different environment but at least you get fish and some rice, not the other way around.",

I'm not brave enough to eat raw fish, so I usually go for shrimp tempura. I order the appetizer, which came with 4 pieces of shrimp and mixed veggies. The food came fast and was hot. After biting into my second piece of shrimp, a long vein (poop) fell out of the shrimp remaining in my hand. I have never been so disgusted! I cut into the remaining two pieces, and poop was in abundance. At this point, I'm finding it difficult to not puke on the bar. I ate poop! We notified the waitress, and she revealed that the shrimp came already prepared. $10 for frozen shrimp tempura is pretty expensive. She took away my plate with three of my four pieces of shrimp, and offered free ice cream. We passed.. It was cold and rainy outside. My check came, and I was charged for the meal. I was kind of shocked!   I called the next day to speak to a manager, and a lady named \"G\" reluctantly offered to give me my money back. She never apologized, but seemed upset that I less than thrilled about being served dirty shrimp.   I would never dine here again.. Tragic experience!",

Too bad it's too expensive and there isn't much raw.",

    "text": "I'm a relatively new convert to sushi. I've only been eating it a few years now. At first I was afraid of it, then I never really got any good sushi. I caught the vision about a year ago. Since then I have been everywhere trying everything. This is my favorite sushi place so far. My mouth waters every time I think of having sushi here. Everything I've tried has been really good.   The flavors are vibrant and not muted. The spicy food comes out spicy, the cold food comes out cold, the hot food comes out hot, the sweet food tastes sweet, the crunchy food is crunchy, and the soft food is soft. It all works wonderfully together. It really is like an orchestra in your mouth.  Everytime I go there I randomly try a different dish. Each one is better than the last. I really enjoy choi's favorite, hands-up, and the pearl. If I had a complaint it would be that the menu gives each dish a unique, sexy,  sometimes fun raunchy name, but does a poor job of describing the differences between the sushi rolls. Ultimately it doesn't matter cuz they're all very good.  Service is usually average to poor. They do a good job of turning tables quickly but not really taking the time to be attentive. But the food is so good that nobody cares.  Tanoshimimasu",

I let the waitress know that I have a fish allergy and asked if it would be possible for the chef to clean his knife to make my cucumber, avocado and asparagus roll. The waitress said the chef would be able to do so.   While eating my food, I noticed some small, orange balls on my sushi. My boyfriend and I did not know what they were. We called the waitress over and asked her if she knew what they might be. She replied, \"fish eggs\". I let her know that I could not eat that as I had a fish allergy. She said, \"not shell fish\". I replied, \"I have a fish allergy, not just shell fish! I don't eat fish!\" She asked if I wanted the chef to make me another roll. I let her know that I didn't trust the chef and could not be certain if he could make me a roll without fish eggs on it. Especially since I had already mentioned before ordering that I have an allergy.   I refused to eat anything else and therefore, I am now the first person to review this abominable restaurant!  This is Las Vegas, food capital of the nation! Exceptions and dietary concerns should be considered in this well advanced year of 2015. I have every right as anyone else to request a simple customization to meet my dietary needs so our entire party can enjoy themselves. This establishment almost made me seriously ill! Beware!",

    "text": "Okay..I will try to be fair here with Sushi Loca.  Keep in mind, 3 stars doesn't mean that this place is horrible.  It just means Sushi Loca was just okay.  Let's start with the restaurant and service.  This is one of the bigger sushi restaurants that you'll find out here. I dig the decor, colors, and huge sushi bar.  As for service, they strive at this as well.  I had zero issue with their service and ambiance. Good start so far.   Now for what's important, the food.  I didn't try their $9.95 two-item lunch special, but this seemed to be the trend for every one else that was eating here.  By the looks of what people were eating, looks like a great deal with huge portions.   I chose their fish only dishes which were their;  -Yellow Tail and Salmon Sashimi:  Probably the highlight of my lunch. Fresh, not fishy, and thick slices of fishes.  Some people like their shashimi thinly cut, but it doesn't matter to me as long as it's tasty and fresh.  Sushi Loca got this right.  -Spicy Tuna and Salmon Skin Hand Roll:  Compared to other sushi spots, these hand rolls are a lot bigger.  Regarding taste, I've had better.    -Taste Like My X-Girlfriend:  This is one of their Extraordinary Rolls (aka Yum Yum Rolls).  Regarding the name, which girlfriend are they talking about?  No but seriously, their Extraordinary Rolls had names like \"Love My Ass\", \"I Did Your Girlfriend\", \"Taste Like My X-Girlfriend\" and \"Sex on the Beach\".  The names are amusing, but not the type of menu that you give to your young kids to read.  I will dabble in a few Western Rolls every once in a while.  I only did it here because I was just curious.  The \"Taste Like My X-Girlfriend\" consist of shrimp tempura, crab, scallops, spicy tuna, and all of this was covered with their crunch sauce. I didn't think it was bad.  It just had too much going on.  If I get this next time, I will probably tell them to cut the crunch sauce and mayo.   The food here isn't bad depending what you get. I'm not a fan of the rolls I got, but loved their shashimi.  But because this place lacked AYCE, I had to spend all I can spend.  Overall, nothing really special here at Sushi Loca. I spent close to $50 for the same quality that I could have gotten at Yummy, I-Naba, and Kazien at half the price.",

We got seated pretty quickly when we got there and the server brought us little bowls of cucumbers with sesame seeds and strips of crab meat on them. Then she took our drink orders. We did not do all you can eat but a la carte. I'm not sure if they have all you can eat but if they do, I'm going back for it!   We ordered the Jackpot roll, TTL roll (has no rice), California roll, Choi roll (with cucumber instead of rice), Chicken Katsu, and Garlic Edamame. All of it was delicious!   The Jackpot roll was perfect if you're not a spicy lover and love shrimp. The TTL was also amazing (it's a life changing roll for one of my cousins LOL). It does not have rice so if you're looking to eat healthy and want some spice in your life, it's the one to go with. The California roll was also a good take on a classic roll. The Choi roll was by far my favorite for the night though. If you order it, try the the cucumber instead of the rice! It is so good!!! Also, the Chicken Katsu was delish! I've often tried Katsu that's been dry but this was perfectly moist and the breading was crunchy. Last but not least, the edamame was also very tasty as well.  Overall, I would most definitely come back to this place!!",

By then there were three more parties behind us. So someone then finally seats us.   We take a look at the menu (which was sticky and full of sauce splatter) and many of the rolls have soft shell crab and shrimp tempura in them. So for us, we're automatically turned off. By then we're feeling stuck with our decision to eat here, so we order inari, spicy salmon roll, and Loca special roll. The rolls came out quick, but the rice was undercooked, the fish had zero taste, and one of our rolls was swimming in ponzu. Anyways we eat our rolls, but during this time no one checks on how the food is and no one comes by to refill drinks. The wait staff can't be bothered for anything as they're literally running past the tables. We ask for the bill, which after ten minutes doesn't come out. Another waitress stops by to ask of everything is okay. Well, we just need a bill. oh brother. Understaffed? Overpacked? Combination of the 2? I don't know, but the food was bad and the service was bad. No reason to come back.",

Rolls average about $7 for a basic roll and around $11-12 for a regular roll. Booths are nice and big to fit at least 6.",

First off, you're greeted by the sushi chefs when you walk through and seated promptly. From there on, you get to see the many variations of rolls with creative titles accompanying the dish. Me and my family got three entrees and three rolls which were all fairly priced with the quality matching. That and a very attentive waitress plus great looking ambience makes this a stand out from the rest in Las Vegas. I for sure will be making many trips here when I move out here. Great job n keep it up!",

The quality is not good; wasabi and ginger plate I received was all dried up, the cucumber salad they served tasted like it was prepared a couple of days ago and to top it off, when the guy served us the cucumber salad he had one finger in the salad ( not cool ). I sat at the bar and asked the guy making sushi what he suggested to eat, he grabbed the menu from me to point something out then went back to making the sushi roll without washing his hands. MENUS CAN BE ONE OF THE FILTHIEST  THINGS IN A RESTAURANT. Another thing, the batter on the tempura shrimp looked and tasted old. After all that I ate my sushi rolls with some hesitation. There are other sushi places  that trump this place so  from now on I will drive further and even pay more to get better quality.   Just gave them 2 stars: 1 star cause the people were nice and 1 star cause food did not make me sick.",

It's rightfully named so make sure your wear protection, it's messy.    Very fun environment at the sushi bar as well.  The sushi chefs are a riot and can drink you under the table.

I like it and wouldn't want them to change.  Food is really good too. The best are the crispy rice with spicy tuna.  My wife and I agree that it would be our final meal if on death row. They have a bunch of crazy rolls with names they use for shock value. I eat the nigiri and their sashimi salad is really good too. If you have non sushi eaters, the need to order the chicken karage. It is a fried chicken dish, but they marinade the chicken bites before battering and frying them. They are very good! I usually order the \"Hibachi Sauce\" with them since that is what the waiter called it one night. Half of the time they bring the wrong one so I don't know what it is called I guess.   This is where I found Hamachi Kama (Yellowtail Collar) with ponzu. They had salmon kama on sale one night and a guy next to us got it. I asked what it was and ordered one since they were like $3 that night. It was soooo good. The next time I tried ordering it again and they told me to try the yellowtail one. The yellowtail one kills the salmon one.  Service is really good there. The staff are prompt, and you never have to look for someone to help you. I usually don't experience good service at sushi restaurants and this one is the best by far.",

My husband got up to help her out while I waited for the waitress so I could inform her of what happened and ask for our food to go. Once I told and showed her where she threw up her response was, \"Oh\", and then walked away. No one made an attempt to clean it or provide us with the necessary items so we could clean it. She never came back to our table so we had to talk to the cashier at the front. That is completely unsanitary that no one made an attempt to clean it up. My husband wiped up what he could, but again, no one sanitized the area. I'm pretty sure that is a health violation.",

    "text": "This was mine and my husband's all time favorite sushi spots in Las Vegas! We lived close by so we were very happy when we found this place.  My favorite dish was the tuna poki!! It's served with seaweed salad mixed in and onions, The tuna was always fresh!! We are the raw fish kind of sushi eaters so freshness is very important to us... Another thing about this place is the name of their rolls...they have a roll called \"Taste like my Ex Girlfriend\" we always get a kick out of it when the waitress brings it out to our table.  Great place, great vibe and great service!! Can't wait to go back...",

    "text": "Ok not to be a dick but go here ATLEAST once a week spend 50 or so everytime went with my family on a Sunday night ordered my usual we get now not to talk bad about the food but THE SERVICE IS HORRIBLE NOW!!!! ordered about 6 rolls and found a 2 inch long hair in my roll then complained about it bill came out to be $130 now I was not expected a compt bill but HALF off ATLEAST being a regular who pays the bills at that place!!! Manager on duty said nothing can be done but just 1 roll?!?! I work at I high end place where multi mill people come in all the time and we ALWAYS show customer hospitality bill comes out to be 100 still. Will never go back will never have my business again and I'm not the type of person to ever right a review on a place it is what it is but with my family there and having them witness what happened and how we were treated as in cooks laughing in the back at us not happening again. Save your money save your appetite and dine somewhere else it ain't worth the headache!!!!",

    "text": "Meh. I'm always skeptical of sushi places I don't normally go to so I guess I didn't give them a fair chance today. I ordered garlic tuna and salmon nigiri and a roll that had mozzarella cheese melted on it. I know cheese and fish is a big no no but I've been duped by odd flavors before and loved then so I gave it a try. Not good. Nigiri was sliced so damn thick, I had to take two bites and it was not fresh tasting to me which instantly turned me off. Rice had no flavor but the sauces were good. I tried mochi for desert and they both had a fishy taste to them. Done.",

And although the decor is cool and the employees are friendly,  the place is loud.  I mean LOUD.  So loud you can't hear the person you're eating dinner with.  What's the point of eating out if you can't even converse?",

    "text": "We were making a long drive from Reno through Vegas to Phoenix. A fourteen hour drive (just in case you were curious). We got to Vegas just about in dinner time and wanted something light, fresh, fun, and laid back to gear us up for the next leg. We found Sushi Loca in our hunt and got exactly what we were looking for.   The cuts of fish were nice and think in both the tuna rolls and the Philadelphia roll. We didn't try any of the signature rolls, but they had some really awesome names and I would give them a go next time we are in town.   We also shared the Tempura dinner - really great. Not too greasy, nice crisp and again - fresh.   I appreciated the caliber of food with the really relaxed environment. Specially in Vegas which seems to be full of over priced and over dressed restaurants.",
