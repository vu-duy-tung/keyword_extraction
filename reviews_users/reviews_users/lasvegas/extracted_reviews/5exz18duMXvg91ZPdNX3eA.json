I've been ordering from Postmates for a couple of weeks and this is definitely the best fried chicken I've ever had in Nevada I've been here 19 years I've never had better Fried Chicken. The portions are gigantic the crust is delicious the chicken is moist and high-quality. No question this is one of the best fried chicken places. This is the kind of place that you eat at and then you tell your friend hey you have to try this. I couldn't imagine someone would eat this fried chicken and give it only three stars. I actually read the negative review to see what they were even talking about. I don't review a lot if you look me up you'll be able to see but when I do it's usually great. My mom said if you can't say something nice don't say anything.  this place I have to say something because it really is fresh high-quality amazing food.",

Beverages could have been better as this place doesn't offer Coke or Pepsi products but an alternative that has Cane Sugar if I'm not mistaken.  The sauces available to put on your chicken is pretty good, lots of variety. Try the Chipotle one, it was my favorite of them all. There is plenty of space to eat as you can also sit outside if you want some fresh air. Once order is placed there is a short wait to pick up your food. Just about enough time to find a seat and sample your beverage. Overall, it's Vegas and it's on The Strip so it's overpriced but when it's after Midnite, your options are limited.",

    "text": "Ok. Full disclosure- I have been eating fried chicken of all sorts my entire 1/2 decade plus two on this planet (you do the math!). This was the most disappointed meal I have had. Let's start with it is basically a fast food joint. Don't look for a eating experience when going here. I wasn't. I know I was eating at place connected to a hotel in Vegas so you expect prices to be expensive but 4 wings and fries for $22! No, that is just ridiculously and over priced. The lines were not to long and your order came up no faster than that from a Popeye or KFC. I don't like coleslaw which come with the wings so I asked to substitute for Mac-N-Cheese, nope! Can't do it! Really? Why Not? At those prices I should be able to switch. So I ended up with an extra order of fries!  Ok. This review is not about the prices but about the smallest wings I have gotten from a established business whose only food is chicken. I wish I had a ruler so you can see how small they were. They had to be lowest grade wings. Then to top it off they were bland. I know your asking yourself how? with all that season salt in the flour, but the chicken itself was not seasoned first. They had so much seasoning in the flour it began to burn, you'll notice that on the pictures. Good chicken is fried to golden brown and when buttermilk is added it might get a little red but not burnt. Not a good experience. Tables nasty and sticky, even when lines died down no one came out to clean. No one picked up trays or wiped down tables or swept floor, you get at least that at any fast food place. Save your money and get some good wings at the other million places that serve wings on the strip.",

Chicken was cooked to order and was served piping hot with oooey gooey melted cheddar and American cheese, with what seemed like a marinated beefsteak tomato, house made pickled cucumbers , fresh shredded lettuce and a delicious (egg?) bun, and thick cut smoked bacon, perfection !! The fries were piping hot and good , but maybe a thicker cut as an option as they cooled off fast and became crunchy and cold ! While hot they were delicious once cold I threw half away , same for the sweet potato fries, the coleslaw was bland and vinegary ! The real star is the chicken !! Maybe get sides at wahlburger or one of the other restaurants in the bazaar shops?  But I would definitely go back just for the chicken and chicken sandwiches !!",

OK so my hubby and I came into the strip on Saturday night and had parked at Bally's (note: it's not free parking-we paid $7 for a few hours)  Anywhoo with no intention of going out to eat, we saw this shop on the way down the escalators and thought why not as we'd heard great thing about it from the Yelp Elite crew that went (I missed out)  And I'm so glad we did!   We weren't starving - so I ordered the 1 wing and hubby got the thigh or was it breast... whatever it was he loved it. Thick and juicy - lol!  I love love the seasoning and my wing was perfect and moist too!   With it I ordered the Moscato and Modelo 24oz can and we were set!   Food was FABULOUS! Service was SENSATIONAL!

We got a side of fries with the works. I love that the French fries are shoestring which makes each one crunchy. It was topped with sour cream, cheddar cheese and bacon. So rich and decadent. I got a side of hush puppies which were salty with a crunchy exterior and soft middle. So good! We got the Blue Ribbon and Rancher chicken sandwich. We both loved our sandwiches which came with a soft bun, lettuce a house made pickle and, of course, a juicy piece of boneless fried chicken. The portions were huge so we basically left in a food coma. You must try if you are on the strip. You will not be disappointed. I promise.",

The outer skin of the wings were crispy which is the way I love my wings. Fries were thinly sliced and soft. All went well with the Chipotle honey sauce: sweet with a kick of spice. I am taking 1 star away because there were napkins and garbage on the floor when I walked into the restaurant. I believe all restaurants should maintain a level of cleanliness, even if they are considered fast food restaurants.",

We were all content with the portion sizes. The fried chicken was moist and nice flaky crunch crust. Mac and cheese would be my favorite. SUPER CHEESY! I was not a fan of the hush puppies, ridiculously dry. Didn't think it was accommodating that refills were an extra fee. Other than that it was a great visit. Don't think I'd go again but def recommend stopping in to try their food.",

The toppings were cut fresh and the pickle tasted homemade.  Add a side of sweet potato fries and cole slaw for $2.  They are definitely known for their juicy chicken but their honey based sauce selection tops it off. Wasabi Honey and Chipotle Honey were my favorite. You will walk away perfectly full and satisfied.  Only downside is the drinks are not refillable the milkshake tasted like soft serve but was pricey.  Just go for the chicken!",

Having never been a fan of fried-chicken *gasp* outside of a chicken finger basket Blue Ribbon won me over with their crispy skin and juicy interior.   The Firebird is one of my favorite sandwiches. You can win me over with any variation on a chipotle sauce. I am also a big fan of their Kale Salad. I was a bit wary of it because just about everyone is doing a kale something or other on their menu. The salad was a nice mix of healthy crunch with the fried chicken I was enjoying.  The food comes out fast, they serve Boylan natural sodas, and cocktails on draft. Their draft beer selection is a nice mix of national and local and might I recommend the Hazelberry boozy milkshake. It's a blend of Nutella and Chambord.   I have yet to visit this location into the wee hours, but they are open until 2am. As if that's not reason enough to give this place five stars!",

Anyways, back to the fried chicken. There was a sign for it, we were hungry, we walked in and BAM, this place kicks ass for fried chicken! You can get individual pieces...like leg, breast, whatever your thang is. Their coleslaw was perfectly slawed and crispy and the fried skin on the chicken...blows KFC out of the water.

Went around 9:00PM and although there were several orders ahead of me, there was always chicken that was available that I saw on the rack. I'm not sure if orders are done in actual order, so I had to wait for them to come to mine. But if an order is small, such as mine, I'd think you'd get to that and move on to the next one.  I really wanted to try this place, since I heard the chicken was pretty good. And although I'm not going to say the chicken is junk, I wasn't wowed or ever thought to myself that I'd really want to come back because the flavor was unique or something I'd crave. To me, it was a one and done type of thing. And I hate saying that of any business. Flavor was good, but that's about it. Maybe the pieces that I had were flavored inconsistently? I'm not sure. But I did notice that a seasoning is shaked onto the chicken. Maybe mine wasn't addressed as much. And that's all that I think. Just so-so in flavor. Perhaps I *might* give them another chance, but only if I'm around the area.",

I ordered a kid's meal with a strip and fries and a chicken wing.  It wasn't busy so our trip was ideal.  My husband and I sat down at a communal table.  The table has a collection of bbq sauces and honeys.  We taste tested all of them.  Chipotle honey was my favorite.  The strip was good, I had a bite and my husband finished the rest.  The fries were good too.  My favorite though was the wing.  It was tender and tasty.  It had more flavor than the strip.  The batter is light, crispy, and not greasy.  The problem is I only had one but I sure did enjoy it.  Next time in Vegas, I'm having more than one wing.",

I ordered the Blue Ribbon Chicken Sandwich and it was so goood. The chicken was both crunchy AND tender (after trying so many fried chicken places, I realized how hard it is to make fried chicken that is both juicy and crunchy) and it went perfectly with the tomatoes, cucumbers, and lettuce. There's also a variety of original sauces and honeys that paired with the chicken very well like the chipotle honey, wasabi honey, wildflower honey, and blue ribbon bbq sauce. If I am ever craving a chicken sandwich on the strip, this is definitely the spot.",

I think there were 15 of us and I was amazed to see how fast they served it up and how consistently perfect it was!  The sauces.. oh my!

The seasoning on the chicken was really good but the skin was super soggy and definitely had a \"been sitting for a while\" feel to it. Pickled cucumbers however were bomb.   My friend said her tenders were super dry but we agreed the fries and mac were really good. I probably wouldn't get the chicken here again but would go for the sides.",

This place will satisfy you in all the right places, if you like fried chicken that is.   Located in the grand bazaar near the escalator to Bally's there is an area with outside seating and a walk up bar that has a small selection of beers and cocktails, there's also indoor seating not much though probably 30 people max. The (Hot Mary) bloody mary it's the shiznit by the way, the mary has organic habanero vodka and a ton of horseradish - OoooWeeee it's good. For the chicken you can get one piece or a few. Blue Ribbon serves up thighs, breast pieces, whole wings, drumsticks, tenders, necks, liver, gizzards etc. I would not recommend wasting your money on the whole wings, they are skimpy on the meat you will not be satisfied. The breast pieces are a good size, two would fill you up. There is a good selection of sauces for the chicken like wasabi honey, wild flower honey, bbq, chipotle honey and habanero. I would recommend this place for sure and will return when I want fried chicken in Viva Las Vegas..",

On my sandwich there was hardly any ranch. Overall we gave our sandwiches a C+. At least the soda( fountain drink) was good.   Side note:some sauce bottles were clogged.",

    "text": "Oh yeah, I'm giving Blue Ribbon Fried Chicken a solid 5 stars just for being open till 2am in the morning.  But it's really all about their fried chicken.  I've had Blue Ribbon Fried Chicken before at Brooklyn Bowl and I still believe to this day that it's my favorite Fried Chicken ever!  So it was no-brainer for me to stop by their new eatery at the Grand Bazaar Shops which was conveniently located at Bally's where I was staying.  I came in late night at around 1am.  Although I was tempted to try their sandwiches, I was really in the mood for their fried chicken so I got their 4-piece combo meal that came with fries and coleslaw.  4-Piece Combo Meal -- <a href=\"/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2Fbit.ly%2F2lhtUAn&s=04c3371a88a9f22478a4c796f28238cfa53da8cbdbc339ce3e8e3ae2786acebf\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">bit.ly/2lhtUAn</a> Sooo gooood!  The chicken was fried perfectly with crispy skin and had a ton of flavor.  Plus the sauces were totally enhanced the flavor, especially the wasabi honey.  It's just as good as their chicken from Brooklyn Bowl, but minus the table service and the bowling.  I definitely plan on coming back to Blue Ribbon Fried Chicken again next time I'm in Vegas to try their sandwiches which all look awesome!  And for sure, I'll be back again for another round of their Fried Chicken.",

Instead of the cole slaw I added extra fries which came at no additional cost. The fried wings were cooked well. The breaded was very light and not crunchy. After the wings came out of the fryer you could see the cooks add seasoning. The seasoning was half way decent, but had a little sweet taste which made it unique but nothing spectacular. The fries on the other hand were excellent. Crunchy and cooked well done. The bartender was offering samples of the in house cocktails. They were surprisingly tasty and contained a good portion of alcohol. This place didn't live up to the hype, but it wasn't a bad place. I am very selective with my fried chicken, so I would still recommend this place!",

    "text": "Came here after wandering for food after visiting the Flamingo because of the smell! Mmmmm! Crispy golden fried chicken?! Sign me up! It was crowded but the wait was short and my wife and I were able to find seating easily. The missus ordered the pulled bbq chicken sandwich and smoked mac n cheese and I ordered the 3 tenders meal which comes with fried and coleslaw. We found our seats facing Giordanos, which was next to the sauce bar. After filling up some ketchups, bbqs and chipotle honeys (oh what?!) had a seat and waited to cluck out. Around 10 minutes or so and my wife's bbq pulled chicken sandwich is ready. Mmmm! We split this (we usually split our meals) and I gotta say the BBQ sauce was amazing! Like a honey bbq. Completely sauced all over the chicken! 'Slaw is smothered on top of that. Tasty but beware of bones. My and I caught a few. So after I finish my half, I'm snacking on my wife's smoked Mac n cheese, which actually melted the fork it was so hot. It was plan and unsmokey, but ok. Alright, so it's been about 20 minutes and still no meal for me. Hmmm? 25 minutes later, I got my order but guess what. It was my whooole order. My three tenders, plus another bbq chicken sandwich meal! I said we couldn't eat that, and they said they would just toss it so I turned that negative into a positive, had em bag it up and found the first hungry person I could on The Strip. Alright so back to my chicken. It was good, seasoned lightly but still had taste. Yes this white guy needs his chicken seasoned AF. The honey chipotle was a nice touch but I could have used time honey mustard as well. If the wait between my wife's and my meals wasn't so long, and the ordered not askew, it would have got one more star.",

I'm not big on fries and I don't usually order them but I ended up eating half of my husband's  (whoopsie). They have Boylan soda which is ok, but I'm a Coke girl. I loved this place so much I had it 2 of my 4 nights in Vegas. We had a nice dinner at Buddy V's one night, but to be honest I was just as happy with this chicken sandwich :) They also had a container for serve yourself complimentary water, which seems to be a rarity in Vegas.

Some of the best fried chicken I've ever had. The inside is nice with a couple tvs and ample seating. There is a water dispenser and a fancy trash can.

The staff there was very very friendly. The prices are also a little high. Cost about 16 for 2 tenders. They do have different flavored honey, recommend the chipotle one. Others in my group got the chicken sandwich and said it was good and moist but again little flavor. Is open till about 2 am which is very nice.

When I looked around the place, I thought it looked cute, clean, modern, yet homey.  The food is very reasonably priced for Vegas. 5 bucks for a chicken breast and 10 bucks for a drumstick combo. The amount of fries we got with the combo was enough for two people as well.  But the chicken... oh lord the chicken..  Best fried chicken of my life. End of story.   I cannot wait to go back here and order the entire restaurant!!!!!!!",

My only caveat is, if you're not a huge fan of breading, I wouldn't recommend this. It's definitely not a \"light coat\".  They have a nice assortment of sauces for you to try, but honestly I think the chicken is fine on its own. They also have some cane sugar colas which are awesome but they don't give free refills which I personally think is kinda BS, but it is the strip so it is what it is.   You can't really eat anywhere \"cheap\" on the strip, but two people can get out of here for under $30 and definitely feel satiated, which is more than you can ask for a lot of other places. Plus, there's plenty of seating. If you can't find a spot inside or outside the restaurant, off to the side by Giordano's there's more.",

It's located in this outdoor food court on the corner of Flamingo Rd and Las Vegas Blvd. They have quite a few options with their pieces of fried chicken, their famous chicken burgers, salads, and other things you can get ala carte. It is not a bad price for Vegas, and the food is tasty. I got their Blue Ribbon Sandwich, which is their most popular/original sandwich. The chicken was seasoned very nicely. You can taste the different spices. It was moist and super crunchy. I added a drink and fries for $2 more. It was SO worth!   My friends got pieces of fried chicken. I tried a bit of their's, and the chicken was the bomb! I wish I was able to go back to that place during my trip, but we didn't get the chance. Next time!   The service there was also on point! They were really friendly and seemed to be enjoying their time serving customers. Unlike most places where you order at the counter and they seem so unenthusiastic. That was a nice change. I'd definitely will come back next time.",

I came here last weekend and got the Cheesy Supreme chicken sandwich and the Fries with the works. They made it a combo, so it also came with a small coleslaw and I got a lemonade. The portions are much larger than I expected, so I wasn't able to finish everything and ended up sharing my fries.   The chicken sandwich came with 2 choices of cheese on the crispy chicken piece along with lettuce and tomato and their special sauce. Fries are made of cheddar, bacon and sour cream..can I say YUM!! Both the chicken sandwich and fries were delicious and I would definitely get them again.   Inside the restaurant, there are plenty of seating for you and a guest, but it's not big enough to have large groups of people. There are tables outside for those that have bigger groups of people eating here. Each of the inside tables has a collection of hot sauces and flavored honey as well as the hot sauce bar.   Employees here are very friendly and accommodating.",

The wing man came with 2 pieces of wings with fries and cole slaw. The wings were alright but they were cold....And it didn't seem like it had much seasoning on it. The fries were shoestring fries which were actually pretty good. I'm not a big fan of cole slaw so I'm not sure if it was any good. The chicken sandwich was also cold. The salad filling inside the sandwich made the chicken soggy and cold. The taste overall was very bland. I was a bit disappointed since they seemed to be quite busy.   Overall, the chicken lacked taste and flavor. Our meal was cold and the meal was unsatisfying. They did have a station for sauces which included honey mustard, ketchup, bbq sauce, habanero, chipotle...etc. Most of their sauces were honey infused so they were on the sweeter side. Still does not beat Howlin Rays Chicken!",

I love me some fried chicken, but I didn't think Blue Ribbon was spectacular by any stretch of the imagination.   The fries are good, and the chicken is solid (lots of pepper flavor!), but it's not lifechanging. The inside of the restaurant was pretty messy when we went (they're busy, I get it, but no one was cleaning up trays that looked like they had been sitting on tables for a while). The staff was also pretty unprofessional; any staff at a Shake Shack or In-n-Out would make this place look like McDonald's in terms of service.  If you've never been to a Blue Ribbon before, this is an \"order at the counter place\" that's pretty narrow inside and ultimately looks like a fast food restaurant (because it is). The chicken sits under lights, and they quickly grab it with tongs and give it to you. You can get food pretty fast as a result, but it's still hardly an upscale fast food place, which you'd expect after spending close to $20/person.   That being said, it serves a purpose. You can get food fast, and it has a lot of bready goodness. It's not fancy, but the fries are bomb, and the chicken is better than most fast food places. Is it worth going out of your way for? I'd say no, but if the craving hits and you just want something simple, it's worth a look.",

They have a great location right in the Grand Bazaar, and we were really hopefully for some life changing chicken, but alas, we found it only to be average or below in almost every respect.   Pro's: -Chicken is actually prepared extremely well and very tender and fresh with a great texture and crunch -Fries were impressive, nice and crispy -Offer some unique shakes, we liked our salted caramel shake -Cool trash compactor instead of a usual bin  Cons: -Extraordinarily pricey, even by Las Vegas standards. $2.99 a drumstick, $4 for a thigh, and $5.50 for a single fried breast? $10 for a 2 piece dark meat meal? Excessive, especially for average size pieces of chicken  -Chicken is BLAND, despite being really well prepared. Hardly any flavor. No spice whatsoever, no perceivable paprika, cayenne, or white/black pepper. And it's like the chicken wasn't even seasoned under the breading. YOU NEED TO DOUSE IT IN SAUCE FOR ANY SEMBLANCE OF FLAVOR.  -Sauce bar sauces were only so-so. BBQ flavors were the best but didn't have incredible depth.. habanero sauce was more of a runny liquid but it was decent and had some kick.   -Paid $4 for the mac and cheese, which claimed to be smokey. It was GARBAGE. Worse than Kraft boxed mac! Not creamy, and the cheese was so bland. There's cheese present, you can see it but the lack of flavor left so much to be desired. It honestly tasted like boiled pasta! I suspected the worst when I was waiting for my food and noticed that at the table next to mine that had been vacated they left an almost untouched mac and cheese there among their trash... not a good sign. I was right.   My friend and I both came to the same conclusion. It's decent, not horrible, but the unimpressive bland flavors couple with the price factor IMO does not deserve the 4 stars they have at all. This place seems to just here to serve tourists who don't know any better or those who are easily impressed.",

Let's be real about fried chicken in any area dominated by tourists and shoppers- you're probably over paying for not-so-southern style fried chicken.  While Church's (aka Texas Chicken depending where you live) and Jollibee hold my top spots for taste and value, this place surpassed my expectations being smack in the middle of the LV strip.  For about $30, my girlfriend and i had a relatively generous dinner for what LV restaurants would offer at this price-point (3 thighs, a fried chicken sandwich, and sides).  There was no wait to order and plenty of seating, which was nice considering we went on a Saturday night.  Their sauce selection at the tables was nice- honey, some special sauce, a combo of hot sauce and honey, and a siriacha-like sauce.  And of course ketchup for non hipsters",

I have been drink for the last few hours and my boyfriend decided to stop here so I can absorb some of this alcohol. This place is located in the shopping area outside of Ballys hotel. The menu is a decent size and but the restaurant itself is small. The chicken is coated with a seasoning that has heat to it. This is what I didn't like. However, the strips I had were still good after I removed the skin. Also, the fries are great! They have many different sauces for your dipping pleasure. We didn't wait too long and the staff is nice.",

The gallery of shops and restaurants by Bally's are easy to miss if you are caught up in the crowd heading up and down the strip. Take a sidestep in from the sidewalk and head straight to the back. It's worth it!   We are in but noticed a brisk take out business with lots of locals. Always a good sign. Lots of tables inside and out.  Long family style seating and lots of seats at the bar.  They are licensed so cocktails, draft including some small brews and loaded shakes are all options.  The menu provides alot of options for number of pieces and white or dark meat.  Sandwiches are huge in fresh buns with loads of dressings.  Coleslaw is the non creamy variety, my favorite. Now the sauce, I believe there was 5 including a wasabi and straight up honey.  Service 5*.  These guys are in it. Fast organized and friendly.  Highly recommend and will be back.",

I think they read my review because they fixed the issues I had. The service was so much better. They got rid of some of the beers and added new ones. The chicken, fries and cole slaw were just as tasty. In fact the cole slaw was so good that I ordered another side of it.  I love this chicken place. I wish they had it in LA. I'm definitely going back when I go to Vegas. The prices are a bit steep but I guess it reflects the market price of the location.",

We ordered the 4 whole wings meal which comes with the wings, a huge portion of fries, and a small side of coleslaw. The fried chicken was only ok. It's definitely better than fast food chains but not the best I've had. The skin was crispy but there wasn't much flavor. I also wish they gave a larger portion of coleslaw to balance out the oil from the chicken and the fries. The only downside to this place was there was literally no more sauces out on the table and their sauce station had a lot of empty bottles. Overall, it was a decent late night meal but I probably would choose something else next time.",

First off Instagram is all show some of the stuff that I saw they didn't have as people make their own or it was a monthly special.    Ordered a kids meal it comes with 1 chicken strip and I added one more. It was $3.25 for an additional strip I shouldn't haven't ordered another one because the portion is hugeee!  My kid couldn't even eat 1. :( We also ordered the family meal and 2 of their chicken sandwiches. Everyone seemed to enjoy the chicken. I ended up eating the chicken sandwich we ordered the blue ribbon original and the Firebird.  The original one was okay! I liked the Firebird better it was super spicy though but it was a good kick.  I wasn't too crazy for the pickled cucumbers. I love pickles but cucumbers on a chicken sandwich odd combo to me but some people love it. The fries were really good as well as the shakes.   Elvia the girl at the front as well as the others working there were amazing. But Elvia was a total sweetheart, patient and helped me on what to order. They have some good service here.  All in all it was good and glad I can cross this off my list of places to try.  Prices are a little high but overall a good spot to try.  They are very clean and constantly coming around wiping the tables and cleaning up.",

    "text": "Located in the back corner of the Bally's Grand Bazaar Shops (if you're entering from the Las Vegas Blvd. side), this chicken joint completely threw me for a loop.  I wasn't sure what to expect going in.  Since I've been on a bit of a bacon kick lately, I decided to try THE PIT (crispy fried chicken sandwich with aged cheddar, smoked bacon and BBQ sauce)... Whoa!  I was blown away by the juiciness of the chicken breast.  The hearty bun was toasted slightly but still soft.  The cheese, the BBQ sauce, the Chipotle honey... the service, the wait time... it was all spot-on.  That $9.75 delectable monster barely fit in my hands but I managed!  The stringy fries were fresh, as was the coleslaw.  Beverage-wise, that Boylan's Diet Cane Cola was leagues better than any diet soda I typically drink.    When it was all over, I actually enjoyed watching the futuristic-looking trash compactor do its thing... ha!   This was the last meal before my return flight home, so I was definitely glad to cap off my Vegas trip on such a high note.                   I'm honestly racking my brain to try and think one thing I did not like... but I've come up empty-handed.  Even at $17 for everything I had, it's still significantly cheaper than most restaurants on the strip.  Bravo, BRFC!!  So... when are you coming to Orlando?",

The chicken wing was great, I loved it. It was crispy and seasoned very well. Next time I go here I think I will do a wing combo vs. a sandwich, both were good, I just prefer the wings over the sandwich, They had a few different house made (I think) hot sauces to try. The fries were okay.   This location in particular is small, but they have outdoor seating if you can't find a spot inside. The staff were very friendly, they greeted us as soon as we walked in the door. The food is made to order, so there's a little wait, but it wasn't too long, Maybe 10 min. I guess for Vegas the prices aren't too bad, especially being on the Strip.  I would love to here again someday!",

Super juicy, amazing flavor. They look spicy/hot but they're not; they're just perfectly seasoned. You won't get a crunch like a battered tender, but instead it's almost like a crispy skin. The fries are good, but if you have to choose one side, opt for the smoked macaroni and cheese. I have no idea what kind of cheese they use, but it'll be my life mission to replicate this. O. M. G. 10/10 would order again. My husband got The Rancher and raved about it. Add this to your must-visit list in Vegas.",

My favorite sauces were the honey-based ones, especially the wasabi honey and the chipotle honey. The sweetness provided a nice contrast to the savory flavor of the chicken.  The fries were also a nice surprise I was not expecting. They were cut thinly and tasted super crunchy. Blue Ribbon probably ranks as one of my top spots for fries!",

On the tables, they have a variety of different sauces.  I really like the Honey Wasabi it's more sweet than spicy and I don't even like wasabi.

Friendly hello upon opening the door and the aroma of fried urns, spices and chicken tips the scales.  Several options of He icee of chicken you desire and nice sides to accompany them I went with a breast and two wings that came along with shoestring fries that were plentiful and a side of coleslaw that was delicious. Chicken was juicy inside and super crispy and  super favorable on the outside. If you are in the area this is a must try. Just good fried chicken.",

Pieces were seasoned well and  breaded perfectly with just enough crunch on the outside, but soft and tender on the inside.   It was early February at the time and it was hot as hell inside.

The chili one that I had was actually pretty damn spicy so it kinda gives a twist to your regular fried chicken sandwich. The other reasons why I like it though is that they have a good variety of sauces(honey, chipotle honey, wasabi honey and so on). I also really love the fries. These kind of fries are my absolute favorite. The thinner the fries, the more I like it. I had a bite of the fried chicken itself because my friend ordered it and that was the most surprise of all because the chicken itself was actually very good. However, I'm still unsure if I'll get the chicken itself over the sandwich just because I feel it's more worth it for the sandwich in terms of being full and a good portion vs the chicken itself.  I personally liked Blue Ribbon...It isn't Howling Rays but I would definitely come back AND it's probably one of the cheaper meals you can get in vegas.",

I bet you can walk next door to wahlburgers and get a better sandwich. Or get pizza at the giordano place next door. This is awful. And their service is nothing special. Forgot my beer and i had to ask her for it and then she started checking past receipts like i was lying. Foh. You guys can enjoy the product of good marketing while i go eat good food.",

The chicken is delicious and the fries are great. My boyfriend doesn't even like fried chicken and he went crazy over it. It's a must do if you are in the area.",

While I haven't tried a lot on the menu yet I can easily say this is the best fried chicken I've ever had. I've never loved fried chicken, but I find myself craving this place. It's pricey for sure but it's also on the strip. I like that they let me have extra fries instead of the coleslaw. They also have some good dipping sauces. Their homemade ranch is really good and their chipotle honey is so delicious. I'm so glad this place opened up next to my job.",

My chicken was cooked perfectly, fries were generously portioned, but the sauce definitely gave it that perfect kick. I also tried the Mac n cheese which was VERY cheesy.

I usually hit up Popeyes, but I'm in Vegas, i can have Popeyes anywhere. And lets be honest, that can always be hit or miss depending on which one you go to. Blue Ribbon was amazing! Great quality big pieces of chicken and fried to perfection! Im a thigh man so i devoured two pieces & some bomb mac n cheese. I struck up a conversation with the store manager to get some info about their history and he couldn't have been more friendly and insightful. Gave me their history and even showed me how to properly mix the various honeys & hot sauces to get the maximum signature flavor. Next time im on the strip im definitely going back! They even have a walk up bar so you can walk the strip with a PBR and a drumstick in your hand lol",

    "text": "Blue Ribbon is a bona fide restaurant empire, spanning the continent from South Beach to Los Angeles. It's grown from a late night chef's hangout to a dominant brand in high quality sushi, oysters and grilled meats. Their sushi has always been slightly above my price point, so I jumped at the chance to taste their touted fried chicken in a casual Vegas takeout spot.  Sadly, it was not life changing. For about $10, you get an enormous fried chicken breast sandwiched in a woefully inadequate bun. While the Cheesy Supreme and Firebird look gorgeous on Instagram, they're challenging and somewhat tedious sandwiches to eat. This is primarily due to a lack of seasoning. Yes, Blue Ribbon chicken is surprisingly bland, with most of its flavor provided by sauces and condiments.  The chicken itself is well-prepared, but the skin is dry and crunchy. Due to it's thickness, little flavor penetrates into the dense interior of the chicken beast, leaving you with bite after bite of tasteless matter. You can pump as much ranch or chipotle mayo as you like onto the carcass, but it doesn't quite compensate for what ultimately amounts to a mediocre recipe.",

    "text": "I visited Blue Ribbon Fried Chicken right after they initially opened in Las Vegas.  The chicken was moist and delicious, and they had a variety of sandwiches.  They even offered fried chicken backs, gizzards and livers.  You could not get any more Southern than that!  This place was \"da bomb\" and I could not wait to visit again!  Fast forward, May 2019, HOW CAN A RESTAURANT DEVOLVE SO QUICKLY!!!  The menu was completely different.  They no longer offer the variety of sandwiches, there were no fried livers and gizzards and they even took the sweet potato fries off the menu... this is a travesty of justice!    When I noticed this drastic change, I should have turned around and walked out.  However, I gave them the benefit of the doubt. The young man at the counter was the same one who was there at the opening.  When I asked what happened, the only excuse I was offered is the supplier changed.  Aaaah, hello, the supplier of what.... the supplier of chicken, the supplier of flour...what part changed, the supplier of cooks in the kitchen!?!?  It did not make sense because the supplier should not affect the quality and taste of the chicken.  Now, after we ordered the food, it was nothing short of sad.  The french fries and tater tots were super greasy, the macaroni and cheese was on the dry side and the chicken was overcooked,  the chicken tenders were beyond dry....they murdered them and they did not offer the variety of barbecue sauces they had when they first opened.  I have to say, there is nothing worse than getting full on nasty food.  I was so embarrassed after bragging about how good this place was to my family.  The crazy part is my niece said we could have gotten better food at Popeyes, at least they always deliver!  I could only hang my head in shame.  Unless something changes, I will not be going back to this restaurant unless there is a miraculous improvement.",

    "text": "Blue Ribbon Chicken is in the Grand Bazaar Shops by the Bally's escalator and across from Starbuck's. It is a restaurant that would be at home down the Boulevard in New York-New York considering that it started in SoHo New York City around 25 years ago.    This marked my second Blue Ribbon Chicken experience. My first time in one was in April 2016 when I dined in the Downtown Summerlin location. The Grand Bazaar location had been so close yet so far away. Physically I had been in its shadow several times when I hung out across from it in the Starbuck's patio. Mentally it wasn't in my radar for the restaurants that I wanted to dine at. That was until late November 2018. In the beginning of the Holidays Season when the Las Vegas Strip transformed into a Winter Wonderland, I did one of my Seasonal hikes there. Planning to take a break for a fast food dinner, I made an executive decision to give this restaurant a try.    In hindsight this is one of those restaurants where the delicious aroma tasted better than the food. If I was clueless where in the Grand Bazaar Shops it was, my olfactory scent would of led the way.   Before setting foot in the restaurant, an outside window menu made ordering easy. I like it when restaurants have menus away from the counter. I don't feel as if I am holding up a line or making myself uncomfortable with an employee anxious for me to make up my mind. However, the menu excluded the prices of drinks. Could it be that a medium fountain beverage costs $3.25? Inside the overhead menu showed additional items including beverages. Being on the Las Vegas Strip, restaurants have to have adult beverages. Right? To the left of the outside window mirror there is a window where customers can order adult beverages.    My mind was set on the two piece breast and thigh white chicken meal with shoestring fries, and cole slaw. It costs $11.95. The medium soda as I stated earlier was $3.25. The total came out to $16 and change. According to the Blue Ribbon literature the restaurants founding Brothers created this special recipe where they prepare the chicken in egg whites coated with matzo meal and fried. According to me, the chicken was sitting on top of a kitchen warmer with several others. My picture of the kitchen below shows this. This is not a bad thing. This restaurant does reach a high busy level where the staff have to take precaution to avoid long waits. When it came to waiting for my food, faster than I wrote this sentence it was ready. I paid and before reaching my chair, they called my order. In contrast, when I dined in the Downtown Summerlin location that has since closed, they provided me with a beeper that went off a few minutes later when that food cooked from the time of order was ready.    The plate included a superfluous of shoestring fries. They were solid yet nothing spectacular. The chicken was decent. Just as I remembered the late Downtown Summerlin location, the skin was far better than the meat. I feel that they could of served a larger breast and thigh. The thigh was more skin than meat. At least during my visit. This brings me to saying that at a $16 and change price point, the customer ought to be able to order two chicken breasts that has superior meat than the chicken breast and thigh. The cole slaw that I saved for last was solid. In the beverage department, Blue Ribbon provides uniqueness in serving Boylan fountain beverages. They are known for using cane sugar in place of high fructose corn syrup. I dig Boylan Cream Soda.    Blue Ribbon is an upbeat restaurant to dine in. The same positive energy that fills the Las Vegas Strip covered the eatery. It is a long eatery in an outdoor mall that reminds me of the Downtown Container Park. In spite of this, I felt like I was dining in a very bright railroad dining car. This is a long and narrow eatery. It was at the long counter that I sat. I preferred this to the long table nearby with strangers. Not far from my seat was the sauce bar. If I had chosen to I could of spruced up the chicken with one of the five sauces seen in the sauce bar photo below.     Based on my experience, Blue Ribbon is obviously a fast food restaurant serving a decent chicken meal that in my opinion is not worth $16 and change with a beverage. Even for the Las Vegas Strip. Who knows if I'll return.",

The place is not very clean. The worker were not very friendly. The smoked Mac and cheese was ok. It's so disappointing it looks so good on Instagram. And the ranch was bad. Maybe I came on a off day. But I won't take another chance I won't be back. The 2 is for the one friendly worker and the decent Mac and cheese. They have no chicken sandwiches or buffalo wings here the pics on these reviews are pretty misleading",

    "text": "Had a burger with extra chicken and a single wing al carte.  The extra chicken on the sandwich is just another patty. Though it admittedly is quite a bit of food. Wouldn't really say the sandwich was so good that it was worth the 13-14 dollars.  I wasn't impressed by this small fried chicken chain despite being very hungry. The food was fine but nothing was particularly outstanding.   The breading they use is on the bready side and tastes like many other fast food chains. This is especially noticeable with the patty which isn't a piece of chicken breast but more processed like a culet, or again like something you'd get at a chain. The chicken wing I got was fine but it just wasn't high quality.  Was also turned off by the cashier who was rude. I normally don't write about service but this was pretty egregious especially given it was in Vegas.  You can add other sauces at the table though I did not since I wanted to try their food as is.   Personally I would skip the meal here at blue ribbon fried chicken given all the other amazing food choices here in Vegas. It definitely does not compare to great fried chicken places in LA like Howlin' Ray's or Dave's Hot Chicken.",

Coming from Alabama where I have access to a bunch of fried chicken, I didn't think that the chicken I had was that great. The chicken was moist; however, the seasoning on the outside of the chicken almost gave it a slight bitter taste. Maybe I'm used to a different type of seasoning, but eating chicken here wasn't as life-changing as I was hoping it would be.   I will say, however, that management is very generous. The cashier accidentally rung me up for an extra piece of chicken which caused some confusion. She quickly fixed it, and I waited for my order. When I went to go pick it up, I noticed that they gave me two free pieces. So, even though the chicken is just decent, I can tell that management is very customer satisfaction-oriented, which means that you will have a nice dining experience either way.",

    "text": "Saw this place when we ate nearby the day prior. We were with a group of 7, which included two children.  If you have not been here prior then you have a range of selection from sandwiches to pieces of chicken and different sides. For us, it was difficult to measure which meal would be appropriate for us. We opted for chicken sandwiches and two piece meals for the younger kids to share. We also ordered a Nutella milkshake, mac and cheese, as well as spicy coleslaw. The milkshake was phenomenal.  The fries that come with the meals are thin and actually really good, you do have the option to do the works, which brings cheese/sour cream/bacon, but it seemed like too much. The chicken is great and the wasabi honey was delicious! As for the mac and cheese and coleslaw/spicy coleslaw, you won't be disappointed. The Mac and cheese is really cheesy and a good proportion with the small size.  Overall, it is not too excessively overpriced, but it is $10-$15 per person depending on if you order a drink. The soft drinks are craft, which means it is slightly different than the regular syrup.  We will most definitely be returning here, but be mindful that seating can be limited considering it is not a huge restaurant, but we were lucky to find seating for 7. There is a take out option, which seems pretty convenient, which we will probably use in the near future!",

ORDER & TASTE: * You order first then they will give you a buzzer for when your order is ready.  When you pay with card, there is a prompt to tip - I don't appreciate this system especially because of the service I received. I don't think they served the tip.  The girl taking the order was not friendly.   - 2 pc tenders ($9.95): this is the combo that comes with fries and coleslaw. Chicken itself was okay, wasn't dry so that was at least good. But presentation was terrible. If you like the thin strongly fries, it is pretty good. It was crispy. Still think it was expensive for the 2pc.  - fries the works small ($7.75): I honestly didn't think this was with it at all. It didn't like very appetizing and it was super oily.  Don't waste your money.  * For the price, didn't think the food was worth it.  CUSTOMER SERVICE:  - was disorganized and did not seem like they had a system at all.  - waited forever for our food. Which is stupid since they already have stuff ready.   - once we got it, it wasn't event correct. Had to go back inside to get the missing item from our order.",

Ordered the 4 piece meal, which is a breast, whole wing, drumstick, and thigh. Price comes in at $17.95, cheaper than if you got the dark meal and the white meat meal as separate orders.  Meal comes with fries and coleslaw. Added a side of smoked mac n cheese (extra) bringing my order to around $23. I mean, more than I'd pay for chicken at home, but not the most expensive meal I've eaten on the strip by far.   Heavy on the seasoning, but the breast was really large and juice and so was the wing. I was also pleasantly surprised to find the fries were really really good. I'm not a coleslaw person so I skipped the slaw. Overall, good food with an okay price.",

I normally don't eat that much coleslaw but i ate almost half. And I couldn't stop eating the fries. The hot sauce available isn't that hot but that was a minor detail. And the staff brought us water without asking, even though it was self-serve. The only thing I didn't like was how loud the music was--we had to shout to hear ourselves.",

We made the drive and traveled through the redefined concrete jungle known as the strip. Once we rounded the corner I could see the signs shinning bright and from a bustling business. We could see that it was clearly busy because the building is basically a giant class LEGO piece( DECOR: modern, bright, gameshow meets New York City).   We made our way towards the register and we were greeted by about 4 employees anxiously awaiting to assist us. I ordered ITEM after ITEM after ITEM. The chances of me making this trip again are about slim to none anytime soon... SOOOO why not gorge out on premium chicken and such.   Tenders, wings, sandwiches and old school cola drinks. Instant happiness!   In the end my ultimate suggestion... PURCHASE A BEAK TO BUTT to go on your way out. If you plan on drinking and hangin that is perfect A.M. Hangover food thank me later .",

The parking lot is huge but good luck finding a close spot, just forget driving in circles and head to the back. What gets me is the people inside always appear to be people watching as you walk past the big glass windows.  The menu is simple. Get fried chicken or a chicken sandwich. Both are spectacular. Definitely try the fries with the works. I always order the blue ribbon sandwich with cheddar and an extra patty (huge but delicious). The sauces are OK. Seating has never been a problem, but the seats themselves I hate. They're like sticky picnic tables. You cannot wipe them down enough! Despite always leaving full and guilty about the huge caloric intake....I always come back.",

They have indoor and outdoor seating if you need some fresh air. The Bloody Mary was amazing and I highly recommend! The best part is you can always take it to go if you don't finish before your meal. There are many sandwich options and I don't think you could go wrong. The proportions are big but don't forget to add a side of fries. They also have a few different sauces you can add which are on the tables The range in flavor and spices. Don't pass this place up when you're on the strip!",

That was all okay to deal with but i also had the cheesy supreme and with a name like that I figured it had a lot of cheese but it didn't. It was 2 choices of cheese and it was an ok amount.  However, the loaded fries were amazing! Plenty of cheese and nice bacon but the addition of he sour cream it brings was soo good!   Prices were good with everything being at about $8 or $9 but honestly for a place known for the chicken, I was blown away by the fries and the chicken was just good to me. Worth trying but not sure of worth repeating. Maybe getting chicken pieces and not sandwiches would be better",

But the customer service difference is always in the details. Both of my forks melted which was weird. The first one turned to jelly when I tried to break up the chicken breast. The second started curling up as I ate the macaroni. Maybe the food was actually great but having this weird, bent fork in my mouth or trying to use it to get the last crumbs kind of ruined it for me.",

    "text": "This place was hard to find at first. I live in the nearby Las Vegas area and didn't know where to park as well. This restaurant is located in front of the Bally's hotel in an area called the grand bazaar. If you park in Bally's parking lot and you are a resident here, you can park for free for up to 24 hours using your valid Nevada state ID.  Now, about the food here. I would have to say that the chicken is very tasty and tender. There's not so much batter taking over the chicken experience. They seem to use homemade pickles in their sandwiches. I would recommend this place as I enjoyed the food tremendously. However, I would not recommend the lemonade or the shakes. The price of their shakes is $5.95 which to me is ridiculous. You could go somewhere else afterwards and get better dessert for a lot less. The lemonade tastes like the powder mix not like real lemonade. I was very disappointed with it. Also, when I was trying to locate this restaurant, I tried calling but no one answered, another negative to this place. But overall I would give this place four stars for the flavor and tenderness of their chicken. Check them out and let us know what you think!  Update, I am now a vegan and came here with my family for lunch. I had the kale salad and sweet potato fries. They were pretty good in spite that they're known for their chicken. I was hopeful that I could at least have those two things. I would probably have the salad again, it was tasty after all.",

When you go onto Jack in the Box, you will expect to pay around 6-7 dollars for a sandwich. If I think about that, since this place is in Strip and the chicken was fresh too.

Many who wander claim to not be lost, in my travels I stand tall and admit, I have been and will be lost throughout my adventures. Arriving at this chicken joint I'm greeted with humble and inviting personalities from all across the world... The Vegas world. I decided to scarf down a royal wing food entree which consisted of 6 individually picked wings. Succulent pieces of prime poultry. I drizzled every sauce I could get my paws on, and boy.. what a great decision I have made. One of the few good choices I've made in my life. I'm glad to say choosing blue ribbon fried chicken has made my life a little more tolerable. I take my wig off for this place and will return to feast another time. 5/5 will try again.",

She then turned over to the other girl and told her they don't need someone to speak to them in Spanish !!!!! How the fuck are you going to assume someone doesn't talk English !!!! How small minded do u have to be to assume before even talking to us or to even greet us just seconds after walking in that door!

Their chicken is perfectly seasoned and crispy on the outside while juicy on the inside.  A lot of place have fried chicken that tends to be dry from over cooking, this is not that.  You can also try it with different types of sauces, but I preferred it just like that.  The sides are ok.  Beware the place is generally crowded and you might have to sit outside.",

    "text": "Where do I begin? Let me start with the overall taste of the fried chicken since that's what's obviously drawing people to this place. It was good but not as mind blowing as the experience of getting it turned out to be. We got there around 11 pm on a Sunday. There were about 6 people ahead of us in line. The line took about 30 minutes to get to us. We're immediately told by the girl taking orders that all they have is chicken and we can only order chicken. Mind you a fresh tray of fries just came out. I ask if we can order fried chicken livers and she said no. Only fried chicken! In any case, we end up ordering 2 chicken strips at $3.50 each and a breast at $5.50 along with a chicken sandwich. The total comes to around $25! It now takes another 20 minutes for us to get our food. Mind you, the chickens already all premade and sitting right behind the counter ready to throw into a bag right next to a huge tray of now cold fries that we weren't allowed to order while they were still hot! The cashier continues telling people all they can order is chicken.  My number is called and I go to get my food. It's not to go and I tell the guy it's supposed to be, to which he responds, \"that's not what the ticket says\"! Anyways... We begin walking down the strip and I pull out the strips to munch on while walking back to our hotel and they are kid meal sized tiny! I feel like I've seen bigger strips when I've order nuggets from other places! Definitely not worth $3.50 each! They have a family meal which feeds 4 and comes with 12 strips! Truth be told, I could easily put away all 12 of those strips and last I checked I wasn't an entire family! The chicken sandwich wasnt great at all. You could tell that the chaos happening inside the restaurant greatly affected how this sandwich was rushed to put together. It was soggy and lacked flavor. Long story short... The fried chicken was good but the experience makes me never want to go back especially considering the thousands of other restaurant options all around this one!",

I could see it being a problem in the colder months.  Service was great, and the employees in the front and servers were all pleasant.  I ended up getting the dark chicken combo.  For both locations, the chicken was whelming, while the fries were super tasty.  I wouldn't come back though, when there's a multitude of low cost comfort food places around the strip and around town.  If you're near either location and want fried chicken, it's not a bad bet.  Otherwise, I'd make the drive to Raisin Cane's for both price, quantity and flavor.",

They were very generous with those and they were just okay.  When it came to the sandwich I give it a 3 out of 5 and here's why.

I ordered one of their signature burgers (sandwiches) The Blue Ribbon and their dirty fries.  The burger had delicious buns and the chicken was seasoned well and super crispy!  They also give you the choice of many sauces (about 6) which can suit your taste needs from spicy to sweet to savory. The dirty fries are a must try! Absolutely delicious! It includes bacon and Cajun seasoning. My girlfriend also ordered their cheesy supreme burger and really loved it.   Would definitely come back again!!",

This is a popular stop in New York, and I'm happy to see it on The Strip (.. and Summerlin)!  Basics: - Order at the counter and sit down or take it to go - Price Range / Person: $12 - $18 (without alcohol) - Any meal listed + side should fill you up - Classics include drumsticks and the Firebird sandwich (there are also seasonal specials not-so-obviously posted around) - Their sauces are great to amplify flavor profile that you enjoy  Critiques of this location:  - The buns on my sandwich was cold and flavorless; it seriously put a damper on my meal, so I just took them off - No one wiping down the tables consistently; did not happen in the hour that I was there",

Seasoning not so bad. Also ordered chicken sandwich (forgot the name) it came with 2cheeses. Another fail. Bread was hard chicken breast was good size but not seasoned well and not moist. It's a No for me. I would honestly come back to only get the cucumbers again though",

The restaurant was not busy when we arrived however it was very dirty. All of the tables, the floor, condiment station and even the outdoor seating areas were dirty. We went to the counter to order and it was apparent none of the employees wanted to be there. We were not greeted and when we did order the employee wouldn't make eye contact with us. That is very awkward when that happens. The food came out fairly quickly and looked really really good but unfortunately that was not how it tasted. I tried the Blue Ribbon Original. The was so much sauce on it you couldn't taste the chicken and then they piled a stack of wet lettuce on the bottom and it soaked right through the bun. The bun was not even edible. Tried the fries and they were way overcooked and had no salt or seasoning at all. I don't know if that's how the food normally taste here but it wasn't worth the money especially when you drop $50 for the family.",

There is a little area inside to grab wet naps, honey, habanero sauce, bbq sauce, etc.  Go all the way around the loop of the food alley and it is at the end. No complaints and cannot wait to go again to try it hot and fresh. Will try the fries next time too. Ordered: 1 drumstick and 1 thigh.  Crispy. Seasoned right. Delicious.",

Couple the chicken with the excellent service we received and it was a homerun.   We checked this place out after exploring the strip on Christmas Day 2018. All of the employees working the front of the house should really be commended for an excellent job. All of the young ladies working expo and the young man working the cashier were very friendly and helpful and not rude or spiteful despite having to work on Christmas Day. I cannot stress enough the positive affect it has on an experience to have pleasant employees helping you.  I took it upon myself to thank them for their good work and wished them a Merry Christmas.   I had their signature Blue Ribbon chicken sandwich and we also tried their 2 piece boneless strip basket with fries and coleslaw. The sandwich was one of the best chicken sandwiches I've had. Soft bun, well seasoned chicken, pickled cucumber, shredded lettuce and special sauce make this sandwich a hit. The chicken strips have their signature spice blend which has a unique and delicious flavor that pairs well with the fried chicken.  Their fires are the hand-cut type but not the ones that are soggy and greasy. Their fries are crisp and thin and delicious. Coleslaw was your standard slaw, but not the creamy kind. More of a vinegar base with a touch of mayo.   They have a selection of sauces and such to go with your chicken like bbq sauce, hot sauce, honey, chipotle sauce and of course ranch upon request.  Their  ranch has a vinegary tang to it that goes well with the fried chicken.  I will definitely be returning to Blue Ribbon when I come back to Vegas.",

Am I running back for seconds? Double nope. I've had better fried chicken, better chicken sandwiches, and better French fries at fast food places (ie: Popeyes, chick-Fil-A, church's chicken, etc).   Once again, I was super excited to try this place seeing all the yummy pictures on Yelp. I was immediately disappointed because upon ordering the chick behind the reg said they longer sell the Smoke Burger (burger with Mac n Cheese), tears. I then decided to try 2 pieces of chicken and some chicken sandwich.   The dark meat meal consisted of a drum, a thigh, coleslaw and French fries. The coleslaw was disgusting, super watery- no flavor. The fries weren't that hot, with a texture like they've been sitting out. The chicken? The skin was the best part, 4/5- but the actual meat was watery with no real memorable flavor. Blah...Tears.  I then moved onto my chicken burger, The Firebird. Don't let this burger fool you. It may look good, but it doesn't taste good. ***Biggest pet peeve...my bun was cold- it broke and crumbled after just TWO bites! Please take the time and peep my picture to see what I'm talkin' bout, it's so dissatisfying. I haaaaaate when this happens, like freal?   Ready for the icing on the cake? My hubby felt sick about an hour after eating here. Not cool.   Seriously, they're so many other places worth visiting on the strip. I'm not running back for a second visit anytime soon.",

Blue ribbon has a few restaurants and sushi, but we wanted to try the chicken. Blue Ribbon Fried Chicken, is located in the middle of the strip in the Grand Bazaar Shops at the Bally.   You cannot miss this cute little place as it has a huge sign just to fit the flashy lights in Vegas. So first time here, and just like most places you order and you pick up at the counter. We came right before dinner and during the middle of the week so the place was also not crowded. As we approached the counter, there was an awesome guy who helped us out. I did not get his name as he got us to save a little bit on our bill. We ended up ordering: the bbq pulled chicken sandwich with regular fries and a sugar cream soda for myself. My fiance got The Pit and fries with the works with the ginger ale. The guy at the register gave us two The Works fries discounted compared to getting one for $14.75. Kudos for making the suggestion.  If you are not a sandwich person, they do have tenders, wings, breasts, thigh and drumstick options. Their sides, all look amazing as well. They also have shakes and boozy shakes (alcohol mixed into your choice of shake!)   We decided to eat inside since there were not many people. Time for food was just as expected. So the pulled chicken sandwich, pretty good. Chicken was juicy, that day it was perfectly seasoned. The size was perfect as well, not to big or too small and filling for my stomach. The fries, regular and the works were better than most fries I ever tasted. Regular fries perfectly cooked and crisp, not burnt. The Works, omg bacon for days with lotsa of cheese, and sour cream! Bite after bite melts in your mouth and worth getting. My fiance loved his The Pit (had cheddar, chicken, bacon, and bbq sauce).  The sandwich was so good, he wanted more.   Overall, we definitely will come back! Hoping they open one up off the strip in the Henderson area. We would definitely try and stop by every other week. Customer service was on point and the wait time was perfect. Will see ya soon!",

When i went in to finally cure this longing desire, you can imagine it was very crowded. The menu prices give you a bit of sticker shock, but the aroma makes it nearly impossible to walk out empty handed....what do you do??- The voices chanted \"Get the chicken!\"  The chicken was indeed very very VERY tasty, the right amount of spice and perfectly fried. While it beats any of the larger chain chicken places, it does leave you wanting more because you do not get as much portion wise.  Oh, they talked me into getting the fries with the bacon and sour cream -that was good too.  They have different sauces that you can serve yourself- i liked the jalapeno sauce.   On the way out i caught a glimpse of what looked like this pair of futuristic self compacting garbage cans!",

The tenders were very bland, it felt like I was eating a chicken breast instead of a tender because there was so much meat on it. Their was barley any flavor on the tenders, although there was a lot of seasoning on it. The wings however were a little bit better because they were crispier. I don't think the food was worth the price... our total order was around $50 and it was so expensive and disappointing to eat. I recommend not getting the chicken tenders. They also forgot our order of wings. The staff were friendly though, especially the cashier. Sadly would not be coming back for the food though",

It says \"Fried Chicken\" big as day with lit up drumsticks as a border around the place so I went in with high expectations. Any place bold enough to have CHICKEN LIGHTS has to be good, right?!   We ordered the chicken sandwich, wings and the fries with the works. My bill ran kind if high but l didn't care because once again, CHICKEN LIGHTS!  Got my wings and they were tiny and very bland. The only thing that kind of saved them were the assortment of sauces they have.  The chicken sandwich was good size but also bland with the main bit of flavor coming from the pickle inside of it.  The fries were probably my favorite thing. They came with bacon, cheese and sour cream and had delicious flavor but they got kind of dry at the end because the toppings weren't throughout the fries.  I really wanted this place to be good but unfortunately it didn't meet my expectations. It was overpriced and under flavored. The CHICKEN LIGHTS, they betrayed me.",

    "text": "After viewing their Instagram page and reading all of the reviews, I had SUPER high hopes for Blue Ribbon Fried Chicken. With my mom visiting, we trekked all the way down to the Strip specifically so I could try the \"State Fair\"- a fried chicken sandwich with a funnel cake on it!! When i saw it on IG, I knew that I HAD to have one- I'm a huge fan of sweet and savory combinations.  Blue Ribbon is kind of the chicken version of In and Out. Order at the counter, they call your name when it's ready, and there's a small seating area inside and outside. One really nice touch is the ice water already ready for you in plastic cups.   The woman who took our order was friendly and helpful, so we started off on the right foot. But it took FOREVER for our orders to be ready. I knew it would take some time, but it was really quite awhile. When our orders finally arrived, there was a bit of a mixup and the counter people had to scramble to remedy it (basically they put the wrong sides with the wrong chicken).  Ok, most importantly- the food!  State Fair- the chicken itself was great. Hot, juicy, tender, well seasoned. The bread was also great. But the funnel cake added absolutely nothing to the sandwich. It needed powdered sugar, or maple syrup or something to get the sweet going with the savory. I ended up having to add honey to it to get what I wanted from it.   Smoked Mac and Cheese- pretty good! Very cheesy, noodles were well cooked. Could have used a bit more seasoning.   Loaded Fries- meh. We had to ask for a side of sour cream. It was supposed to come with it, but there was barely any on there.  My boyfriend didn't enjoy his Cheesy Chicken Sandwich that much, he said the chicken wasn't seasoned enough for him. Also, he ordered his sandwich with applewood smoked bacon,  and it came with bacon bits on it- which no one informed us that's how they do it. He was pretty annoyed about that! Bacon bits on a sandwich??   All in all, it was fine, and filling, but not really worth a trip down to the Strip just for it. The hunt continues!",

It's tucked away in the Grand Bazaar, so it took a while to find it.  I usually don't like fried chicken, but put it in a burger and I'm all for it. Like most places, you gotta try the original. I got the signature blue ribbon chicken, fries, and tried their wings just for the heck of it. The chicken came out piping hot, fresh from the fryer. It was juicy and the sauce paired well with the chicken. Fries were crispy. Cole slaw was.. cole slaw.  There always seems to be a line, but it moves pretty quick. Not many seats inside, but plenty outside. On hot days, the AC inside definitely helps. As well as the ice cold water they offer.  The walk from Mandalay Bay to Blue Ribbon was worth it. The food coma after, not so much. They offer unique sandwiches every month, so definitely check them out.",

Towards the end where the escalator's taking you up to Bally's are.   There's a small line even at 1:30am on a Friday night. Nice. I tried the original blue ribbon chicken sandwich. Pretty standard with lettuce, tomatoes, pickled cucumbers (they refuse to call them pickles), blue ribbon sauce (a ranchy/thousand island kind of thing), on a nice buttery toasted bun. The sandwich is well balanced and the vegetable ingredients were really fresh. I thought the fried chicken patty was a bit dry, and a little under seasoned. A friend of mine had tenders and thought the same thing for the chicken. I did enjoy the sandwich overall.",

Upon walking in it is loud and a bit small but there is seating outside. The next thing I noticed were the prices. There were close to Five Guys prices and it was over $30 for a beer, fries, two sandwiches and hush puppies. The sum of my Ranch sandwich was not impressive. It was a bit too much bread and I attribute this to the thin piece of chicken that was in it. It was much thinner than a Chik Fil A patty. The chicken was tasty so I would do a leg or breast the next time I visit if I do again. The fries were good but standard at best.   After leaving here, I felt underwhelmed. I feel it was overpriced and under portioned.",

The Hubs got the $12.25 dark combo with the thigh and drum. The cashier must have heard us order two tender combos separately because I brought it back and they gave us a drum + thigh for free.  Condiments: wildflower honey, chipotle honey, wasabi honey, Texas Pete hot sauce, bbq sauce, and ketchup. The wildflower honey with a double dip into Pete was hot, sweet, savory...and what won the 5 stars to my heart. Definitely keeping them as a bookmark and will be coming back.  P.s. The sidewinder fries are an extra cost but I have to try those! They look like the perfectly crunchy film reel fries from Disney CA Adventure's Award Weiners!",

    "text": "\"I'm not mad, I'm disappointed.\"    I expected great things from this place. We ordered the Tender Supreme Combo (3 boneless chicken tenders with coleslaw and fries), a biscuit, smoked mac & cheese, and a Shakedown Street milkshake.   Chicken pieces were much larger than expected. Very juicy and well cooked.   We tried two of their specialty dipping sauces-- the wasabi honey and another honey-based one (obviously I wasn't a fan) were ok, but I would've like a honey mustard option.  They offered standard ketchup and bbq sauce too.   Biscuit was fine, nothing to write home about. Same with the crinkle-cut fries, mac & cheese and milkshake. Although the fries portion was plentiful.   BUT... they didn't give us the coleslaw AND didn't give us utensils!!  We got the order to go so didn't check our bag until we got back to our hotel. It occurred to me while we were getting dessert across the way that we may not have gotten forks so we stopped back in BRFC -- they said they were all out but we're expecting a delivery soon. Seriously? At 7:30 in the evening?!  The kind folks at Giordano's hooked us up with utensils.   Service-wise, the guy at the counter took our order and gave us our food. In between all that, he talked with the questionably dressed girl that ordered before us. I can't say he exuded friendliness or a willingness towards customer service. Which I'm fine with. I just wanted the food I ordered and a freakin' fork. Fail.",

I lucked out the first time I came here because I got chicken pieces that were fresh out of the fryer. The seasoning is the bomb and the chicken was tender and juicy. But the more I visit her the worse it gets.  The season has always been good no matter what time of day or night you slide through Blue Ribbon Fried Chicken. That's one thing that this fried chicken excels at. On the downside, the Fried chicken here especially the chicken wings tastes like they've been hanging out under the heat lamp for hours. And when you do get those type of chicken, the meat is just dry. Drier than popeyes biscuits with any lack of juice of flavor in the meat and the only flavor you get is in the skin where Blue Ribbon employees drizzle their delicious seasoning.  For the dry dessert chicken, you get from this spot they do charge you a lot. Don't think I'd be stopping by here anymore to test my luck.",

Blue Ribbon is conveniently located on the strip. The smell will entice you after a night of partying or just a day of sightseeing. Pictures don't do it justice, but the chicken was hot, fresh, and wonderfully seasoned. For me, there was no need for any sauces, but they do offer a few sauces including a chipotle honey and then your classic hot sauce. My friend's order came out later than mine did and they compensated her with a free drink and an extra piece of chicken. The food is pretty overpriced, but what isn't in Vegas? I got 2 legs and a wing, no fries or a drink, and it was $10. When you're on the strip and get a whiff of delicious fried chicken, you should remember to stop by Blue Ribbon!",

One can literally smell the fried chicken while walking up to his place, it's a tiny restaurant, but with big flavor. The recipe for the breading on the chicken is delicious. I opted not to go for the spicy 5th time period it's hot enough outside, lol.   Upon entry I was greeted by the amazing staff here, they all have positive dispositions and even engaged in a little small talk with me before placing my order of chicken breast and mac and cheese.  My food was delicious and arrived quickly. The juiciness of the chicken is . When you couple that with the perfect breading to coat....well you've got a Blue Ribbon Winner !   When I arrived it was empty but when I left it was packed.  There is communal style seating, a few long tables so you can make the friend while you eat, lol.  Pricing was ok for the strip, my total came up to 12.13 for 2 items.   The last thing I'd like to point out is the amazing music choices. They play a mix of hip hop, R&B, oldies,and general feel good music! It made me feel at home . It REALLY makes the ambiance.  08/01/2019",

Had I not already had one of Las Vegas' best fried chickens that morning, I may have not been so critical. Taking this into consideration, I'm erring on the side of generosity in my rating. Service was slow considering chicken is visibly sitting under warming lamps in the kitchen. Chicken was crisp and juicy and had an overwhelming flavor of paprika, which isn't bad, just noticeable. We could also detect a slight burnt flavor. Biscuits are horrible and offensive at $1.75 each.   Overall, chicken is good but not good enough for a local to bother navigating the Strip for or to pay its exorbitant prices.",

Well, this happened to me the first time my husband wanted to venture to Blue Ribbon. All I remember is the walk and pain and agony in the summer heat. Ok, enough about my saga. Fast forward to the last couple of times we've been back ... this place has been the #1 place I've wanted to go!  They have a very simple menu here with fried chicken, bone in or tenders served with fries and a variety of honey dipping sauces. I like their Tenders Supreme meal (3 boneless tenders) which is a large size, comes with a lot of food. If you're in the mood to splurge, get the hot biscuit too. So good.  Overall, quick and tasty fried chicken spot. Minus one star only because the prices are a bit high. I'm sure we'll be back the next time we're in town!",

Fries and coleslaw were standard and good, and the biscuit was flaky and buttery. The chicken had a spiced crust that deceived me into thinking the chicken would be flavorful. I bit into it though and the chicken was soooooo bland. So so bland. My boyfriend was actually convinced that they may have just cooked a bad batch and forgotten to season the meat but either way, bad news for a place that only does fried chicken. Meat was juicy and the skin was crunchy but I just needed salt and pepper and the people next to us must have agreed because they put hot sauce on every bite.  Prices are also kinda high so I'd say skip and go to Popeyes",

Ordered the 2 piece dark chicken and added a wing. It was supposed to have cole slaw... but I didn't get it. But I also didn't notice until after the fact.  So... down 1 star for that miss.  Chicken took some time to get out, which I expected for freshly cooked fried chicken.  The crisp was perfect as was the spice.  Dip it in the hot sauce, and it's even better.    I'd definitely come back...  and double-check my order next time.",

The taste of their food is just average, chicken is dry, pricewise is on the expensive side eg. we ordered the 4 full wing combo (w/ fries and coleslaw) for $17, and drinks is not included, you have to buy it separately.  Location is very nice in front of ballys hotel where wahlburger is also located. Place is small but clean.  Overall 2.5 stars in my opinion.",

February's annual specialty sandwich, piled high with sweet potato fries and truffle sauce, is my favorite of their featured sandos. Staff at this location are friendly and attentive to detail, my sandwich was perfectly photogenic and easily the size of my head.   This location is in the Bally's Grand Bazaar Shoppes area, convenient to the escalators and elevators. I especially like that they have outdoor seating available. Sauces aplenty here, thankfully- as much as I like the monthly sandwiches they come up with, I'll be the first to admit that the toppings and sauces they add amp up the flavor. The chicken itself is not especially flavorful to me, though it is moist and has a visibly seasoned crust. I stick exclusively to the monthly sandwiches and the mac & cheese.  I am saddened that the closure of their Downtown Summerlin location has made me a less frequent visitor, but if you hustle from the parking garage and don't get distracted, you can get in and out in under an hour and avoid a $9 parking fee.",

Blue Ribbon has always been what I was looking forward to --- until this trip.  This location is on the Las Vegas strip in the Grand Bazaar shops across from the Bellagio and next to The Cromwell.  It's a smaller venue with some outdoor seating as well.    It is counter service, and the staff was very friendly.  The menu is chicken, chicken, chicken --- and fried at that.    I ordered 3 whole wings and a thigh ala carte.  Maybe it was just a bad batch, but it was just off from the expectations of my several other Blue Ribbon chicken experiences.  The breading was almost too thick on the thigh, and a touch burned even.  The wings were okay, but seemed a bit odd as well.  The sauce station was a bit of a mess.  A broken wasabi honey dispenser made a mess and it was sticky as heck. That's understandable, but they probably need some constant upkeep at the sauce station.  The sauces are awesome though and the combo of the wasabi honey and Crystal hot sauce on the chicken is amazing.    I'm not giving up on BRFC, but this visit was a bit of a letdown -- next time will be better.",

Lately we have been saying \"if you went to Vegas and didn't get blue ribbon, did you even go to Vegas??\"   Over the years, it has changed a bit (for example their selection of honey is a little more limited now).   I have ordered almost everything off the menu from here at least once but my favorites are still the sandwiches. However last time I was here (April 2019) I was a little disappointed because the man at the counter said they weren't making sandwiches anymore because they were having trouble with their distributor (WTF?!) and half their menu was like blacked out...  Anyway the service has always been high quality. They are nice, friendly, make conversation and answer any questions you may have.",

The ranch containers were filled 1/4 of the way and when we asked for more because 2 1/4 filled ramekins are not enough for 12 tenders and fries. The fries were okay. You really can't mess fries up. The sauces were not what I expected at all Extremely watery and the taste was bitter. The cups at the sauce station works for about 1 bite of a chicken tender. Service was a 3/10  Both ketchup dispensers were out and so they gave  us 40+ ketchup packets. Tables were dirty and not tended to at all. The Mac and cheese was pretty good! That's why I'm giving them 3 stars  Based on me having to pay 59$ for 12 chicken tenders and fries and two drinks ... extremely disappointed. Will not be returning or recommending",

The wholesome sandwich is accompanied by a slew of honey based sauces to go with my sandwich (or your other chicken based orders) Wasabi honey, Chipotle honey and brbbq sauce is just to name a few.

Try the house-made hot sauces and mix them up. This place is my new hangover haven. Although the price point is high, consider that most places charge too much on the strip. Get the tenders and add extra tenders, explore sauces and drinks. You'll be full and happy.",

The food is reasonably priced, even in a location where you would expect it to be over the top.    Succulent, juicy and flavorful the chicken is excellent.  I suggest staying with the actual chicken pieces instead of the tenders, they had better texture and realistically, the same amount of meat.  The combos come with fries and slaw, but you can sub double fries for the slaw - which I snuggest you do as they are perfectly crispy, crunch and delicious while the slaw is a bit bland.  They have multiple sauces available, be sure to try out the spicy honey.",

So, as someone that loves the chaos of the LV Blvd, it is frustrating to go some of the strip area restaurants only to be disappointed that quality and taste is not high priority... I'm guessing, gearing towards tourist and not for repeat customers. BLUE RIBBON FRIED CHICKEN is not one of those overpriced and underwhelming tourist trap. This fast casual place is not only, over the top with customer service, the atmosphere is modern and comfortable and the food is absolutely delicious at affordably prices. We have had the whole pieces of fried chicken and the chicken strips. Both, are equally as good. The fries are addictive. Looking forward to trying the mac n cheese on our next visit. I can't stress enough, how this place really is worth the wait. They also have adult spirits which is a nice plus! By far, the BEST Blood Mary I have had since being in Vegas. YES, for real! Listen, the Grand Bazaar area is full of tourist trap restaurants... trust me, I been to them all. This really is the only one worth the walk.",

Staff appeared dirty and poorly taken care of, moved extremely SLOW but seemed to make time to play around in the kitchen presenting themselves in a very unprofessional manner, i even seen one of the girls put a chicken tender in her MOUTH! Chewing like a camel while plating food . All in all we had to wait a total of 30 Minutes for them to put 3 chicken tenders and fries on a plate (it wasn't busy at all, we checked on the order twice, and it was actually supposed to be 4 chicken tenders because we ordered and extra but still received only 3). This location should strongly consider NEW STAFF a \"NOW HIRING\" sign is much needed.",

The price is too expensive 6pcs chicken is 22bucks.. for me thats ok it must be good for the price.. We order to go coz our plan is to go at Bally's food court where we can grab rice .. good thing We did! why? the chicken is TOO SALTY!!! salty on its breading but when you eat the inside part of it? Its TASTELESS!!! OMG.. You cannot even compare the price and Taste of POPOYES Chicken or even KFC.. Totally Ripoff",

It included one of each item: buffalo chicken wing, rib, fried oyster (wasn't too crazy about this one), duck egg roll and chicken on a stick. Spoiler, it came out with this really cool sterno thingy where you can cook the ribs to your liking. Really, really cool! Highly recommend this place, staff was awesome and food was delish.

It is covered in a very thin coating of spices, yet the chicken tenders remained juicy and flavorful.  The fries with seasoning were awesome.  Coleslaw was aight... nothing too special about it.

Okay so we can't pay to have cheese added.?. We ordered waited about 8 min for already cooked sitting under a heat lamp food. And his sandwich was made wrong.

We both got the tender meals. The chicken was good but the inside didn't really have a lot of flavor but it was still okay. The fries are amazing and make sure to get the blue ribbon sauce it's to die for!",

Oh it was hard to just walk by this place & not try.  Obviously we just skewed our reservation.  We each ended up having 3 wings a piece!  Should have stopped at 2.  The chicken batter is light & has a dash of that kind of Louisiana seasoning.   The French fries oh lord were so fresh & crunchy! There's a wide variety of ketchup sauces.  Never the less this place is awesome!  Great food & atmosphere.    Now I know what blue ribbon chicken taste like! No regrets, agh let me see about changing the dinner reservation.",

The chicken was slightly salty and not a whole lot of flavor and not as crispy and the pieces were SO small. The drumstick was the size of a chicken wing drumstick. I ordered extra crispy sweet potato fries and it was as if a bottle of salt spilled on it. It was so so salty that I couldn't even eat it. It also wasn't fresh. It tasted as if it was from the day before. It wasn't crispy at all. Also the cole slaw was rancid and tasted spoiled. Everyone I was with complained about the saltiness of all of their fries and also said the chicken was mediocre. This is a small place with indoor and outdoor seats. I rated them a 3 star only because the service was good because their was also a guy who was cleaning up and picking up our trays and he was very nice. Also they do have very good lemonade. Otherwise I would of gave them a 2 star for the food. I will not be dining here ever again unless they improve the quality of their food.",

As for the chicken, the skin was crispy and tasty but the meat was a bit bland. I was surprised will the sauces available. Never thought honey based sauce would taste so good.

If they moved their location I'm sure it would feel more welcoming .  I'm not going to say skip it because the food is pretty tasty , but I'll wait to try the original in New York !! I did review this one more time and decided to give it a 4 star because the consensus of our group is that the food was super good!!

My boyfriend got the blue ribbon sandwich and he said the seasoning was too over powering. However, he said the chicken was nice and thick. It has your typical veggies and the bread was fluffy and sort of sweet.   Their habanero sauce was the best one out of the 5 or 6 that they have. They also have milkshakes that I wanted to try along with the alcoholic ones! This joint also closes at 2am on some days which might be good for those late night munchies.",

Unfortunately, all I got was a half an hour wait (while the rest of my party and numerous other patrons received their food before I did) for some super dry and inedible chicken strips.   Despite this hiccup, the staff was very friendly and even gave me a complimentary soda for waiting so long. My friend really liked the chicken wing and leg, but for me, the flavor of the chicken was really good, just the meat was too dry. The sides, however, really stole the show. The smoked mac n' cheese? Mmmm, tasted like smoked Gouda heaven. And the pickled cucumbers and coleslaw? Tangy, crunchy deliciousness.   They keep it nice an air conditioned inside and their sauce selection is great too! I would definitely come back once I come to Vegas again but would try a different cut of meat.",

    "text": "Such a great place to get delicious fried chicken and fries! My two favorite food!   Their style of fried chicken is deliciously seasoned and fried to perfection. It's crispy, golden brown, and moist, like how fried chicken should be. Their fries are thin, battered and crispy. The food goes so well with each other and it's the best comfort food you can get on the strip!  Try the chicken and fries with their honey sauces: wasabi or wildflower. Both honey are good, even the wasabi one was delicious (that's coming from someone who hates wasabi!)  This location is in the Grand Bazaar at Bally's, which is a new development of modern restaurants and shops that are open late. We came here around midnight and they were still open and happy to serve customers.   Apparently this brand is famous in NYC and Vegas, but being from California this is the first time we tried it since we were in Vegas during NYE weekend.  When I come back to Vegas, I'll hit this place up again and try other combos on the menu.",

The hard beverages ,ice tea and lemonade were ok. But expensive and not strong I guess you go for the chicken not the bar.   I'd go back for the chicken !!",

My boyfriend is the one that ordered the food - a two piece dark and a full wing with fries and slaw. My bf got a few sauces to try, but wasn't a fan of any of them; he liked the chicken better plain. I wasn't personally a fan of the chicken, but that's more his thing than mine. The fries tasted like McD's fries to me and I wasn't a fan of the coleslaw at all. Like I said - I was just here to drink, so I'm trying to merge my review of the mojito and his review of the chicken to be fair.",

    "text": "Since everyone was going crazy over this chicken, I figured I needed to try it! So, I brought my friend from out of town to eat for dinner.   The location itself is perfect if you're on the Strip. It's tucked away in the Bally's Bazaar. There are a few table seats and a bar seating area. It was relatively small, so we had to eagle-eye for a table. There was a sauce station in the corner and sauces on every table.   I ordered the AM-PM sandwich, which is the January special of the month. It was very good. The chicken was actually fantastic. It was extremely tasty and full of flavor.   The three star review is entirely because of the service. I would give one star for the staff, but the food was too good. So, they entirely messed up my order. I ordered the AM-PM sandwich, the Rancher, a side of corn bacon, a small beer, and a large drink. They gave me mac-n-cheese instead of the corn bacon. They charged me for a large beer ($15!) and forgot the large drink entirely, even though they charged me for it. I figured since the beer was already poured, I would just drink it. I mean, more beer is always fine with me. I think my friend got a different sandwich than he ordered, but he was fine with whatever at that point. The food took a long time, so I didn't even bother complaining about the mistakes in the food. Just not sure how so many things were incorrect from my order.   It was pretty expensive for being chicken sandwiches. The total for the above order was $45. However, I understand that it was on the Strip and the alcohol alone was $15. So, it was okay. I would say the prices are comparable for Strip prices. Just not sure I would pay for it again.   Overall, the food was great. Pricey, but great. The staff was very disappointing. I would give this place another shot but probably at the Summerlin location.",

Everybody's orders took forever when all of the chicken was already made and sitting behind the counters! When we got to the counter the seemingly new and clueless counter girl told us we can only order chicken (because they were out of everything) when a fresh pan of fries literally just came out of the fryer.   This place touts its 12 piece tenders meal as enough to feed a family of four. Thinking they were large my friend and I ordered 2 to find that they were TINY. We also ordered a fried breast piece and the Pit Burger. The tenders and the breast tasted pretty good and were fairly crunchy but by no means lived up to any hype. Especially the teeny portions of the tenders. The burger was not great either... it was kind of overstuffed and the flavors didn't really work. It was too wet overall.   Disappointing experience to say the least given the 35+ minute wait with only 6 ppl ahead of us in line and all the chicken was premade..",

The best part about this place is the honey... lots and lots of honey.  Different kinds and no limits (other than it takes a long time to pour honey).  The fries were good (a great way to scoop up more honey) but oddly way more than you would need.  I will give it another chance, but I don't have high hopes that it will beat Yardbird for Fried Chicken on the Strip anytime soon...  Ordered: Kerry's Classic The Drum Line w/ Sweet Potato Fries (two drumsticks)  Overall: Worth the try because of the hype, but if you really just want Fried Chicken you might want to check out Yardbird instead",

After a few bites I felt it was simply too much oil to eat. I had to throw out half of it. I'm curious to try other things on the menu, i.e. the ones with actual meat not the neck or butt.",

It was friend to perfection where the meat just fell off the bones.  The service was great and the manager Marcus made it a point to add another wing to my oder because he though the 3 I had was in his eyes too small.  They close at 2:00 PM but if you get there before you can still sit inside and enjoy your food.  The habanero sauce is very runny but gives that perfect amount of heat when mixed with the ketchup or barbecue sauce.  Kudos for the blue ribbon I highly recommend and will definitely will return.  They also serve sides such as fries, fully loaded, mac & cheese etc.",

I'd say it was ok, but there must be better choices close by.  The chicken was tender and moist, but not freshly cooked or hit. Really barely warm. Whatever seasoning the sprinkle on it after it is cooked doesn't really help with the flavor. I ate the first wing plain. The second I used a couple of the sauces. I'd say these are mandatory because they add a lot. The honey chipotle was good.  I got lucky with the fries and caught a fresh batch. I noticed the cook just dumped the fresh over a large quantity that were already in the pan so in a few orders the people wouldn't be as lucky as I. The mac in the mac and cheese was perfectly cooked but I didn't care for the cheese at all and didn't eat much if it.  Decor is ok. Staff is listless and not too helpful. The people filling orders seemed clueless, I guess just bored.",

The bread was cold, the fries had probably been sitting there for a while since they weren't crispy at all. Just the overall service we received was poorly executed.

    "text": "I came here for a yelp elite event a few weeks prior. The food was good. I appreciated the service, and the drinks were pleasant. So when I was asked what I wanted for dinner we were in the same vicinity so this place was an obvious choice to come back too. Now let's talk about the parking..... THERE AINT NONE. This spot is technically located in the Grand Bazzare Shoppes so to park anywhere near the place you would have to park in the parking garage at A) Paris Hotel  B)Bally's or C) do what we did and parked AAAALLL the way down the street for some free parking and spent a little bonding (walking) time getting to the place. Ha   Anyways it's located the farthest from the street and it's sort of tucked in the back so finding it is a little difficult. Considering I've been there before I knew exactly where it was with no problem. So when you walk in you go to the counter and order up there, they give you one of those beeper type of things to tell you when your order is ready and then you wait from there. The menu is very straightforward. Chicken, Chicken sandwhiches, Chicken tenders, Salad which you can add chicken too. LOL they had a few other things that could be customized but the general premise is the same. I ordered the two tenders and fries meal (8.95 ish) and normally for a few tenders and some fries I wouldn't spend 10 bucks but these things are HUGE and they pile the fries HIGH. Our wait wasn't too long and when it did come out it was piping hot. Like you could see the grease still popping on the tenders HOT. It came with a small side of cole slaw and on the table you have your options of loads of different sauces. My favorite is the chipotle honey mixed with hot sauce and some bbq sauce. Everything was great. The service was excellent. I swear the lady taking our order was so helpful to me and my friend. Explained everything, and was so patient with us.   Honestly I don't even think I finished my entire meal. (think they threw in an extra tender for our wait).My signs of a good restaurant experience is if I leave full and happy. Don't forget to check out their drinks too. I had a hibiscus margarita and it was tangy, crispy, and packed a decent punch. All in all. 5 star experience.",

The photos don't do it justiceeeeee. Chicken was plump & juicy white meat, flavors were there lettuce was crisp.... Just a well put together sandwich to say the least.",
