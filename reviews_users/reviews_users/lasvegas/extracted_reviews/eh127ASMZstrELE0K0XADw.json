I wish I ordered two lobster rolls for myself as it was not filling but the warm buttery bread and nicely seasoned lobster was so good. My sister loved that they provided warm butter with our rolls and lobster tails.   Wish they has stores in the Bay Area!",

Between Lobster ME and Luke's Lobster, I chose to visit Luke's Lobster on account of better rating on Yelp.  Luke's Lobster is located on the outer grounds of the Fashion Show Mall, by the Las Vegas boulevard, close to the escalator leading up to Neiman Marcus. They operate out of a shack (or a pod, as another reviewer put it) so you may miss it if you're looking for a place that looks like a conventional restaurant.",

It did take us awhile to find since the directory was a little confusing but it is such a small store that I was in fact shocked when I entered.  Staffs were super friendly & welcoming. Definitely did a great job of recommending whats good and explained everything throughly. Bummed that it didn't have any seat inside but lucky we got the table outside that's under the air thingie.  My boyfriend got the trio and I got the lobster roll with clam chowder. Chowder was really good, same taste with the ones in SF. The trio is def something for someone who wants a little taste of everything. You get half of each roll and our favorite was def the crab. I wasn't a big fan of the shrimp cause it tasted a lot like the frozen ones you get in the bag. However I absolutely love the crab & lobster roll. Super fresh and flavorful. LOVED IT! For 3 things & a water bottle we spent about $50, we didn't get full of it (don't know whether we were super hungry or just big eaters) but for the quality of the food, I can say it was worth the money.",

It is a split top roll, packed with lobster and light sauce (or possibly mayo). It is a bit pricey, but for what you get, it is absolutely worth it. If I was in the mood for a lobster or crab roll, I wouldn't hesitate to come here again. The shop is small, if you come during the summer, plan on eating inside the mall at the food court. They have seating outside, but if you are like me, that isn't an option during the heat of summer. They have pickles available to accompany your roll which is a nice touch. I believe they also offer homemade chips, but there aren't many options to go with the rolls. Worth a visit if you enjoy lobster and crab, the rolls are delicious and authentic.",

    "text": "Honestly I was excited to try it, but $26 for bite size rolls is a rip off!! I ordered the taste of Maine which is described to be  1/2 rolls of shrimp, crab and lobster but when it takes three bites to finish these half rolls it's hard to believe those are  1/2 rolls! And if it fits in the palm of my hand then what did I actually pay for? I'm extremely disappointed in the portion and quality of food I don't know why there are such esteemed reviews when you could go to Red Lobster and get bigger portions, cheddar biscuits and a meal for $30 and be stuffed!",

I also got the chowder soup which was rich and full of clam chunks. They have small portions but one can understand with the cost of the seafood. Great location (right in front of the mall) and a nice outside seating area. I will be back!",

The portion size was pretty small though and I was still hungry after my lobster roll and chips. However, lobster was cooked splendidly and the sauce was a great complement. The roll-to-lobster ratio was proportional, it didn't have too much bread as you find with many sandwiches. Overall I'd go here again if I was looking for something light, not if I was hangry though.",

One of my cousin's and I split the trio to see which we liked best...and then split a lobster roll on top of that.  It was just so delicious!!!  The crab is right up there with the lobster , and although the shrimp roll is also delicious, I think it takes a third place spot with the lobster and crab.  The pieces of lobster are large and you don't have all that mayo / dressing you get on other lobster rolls.  It was more plain but more delicious if that makes sense.  We also shared the lobster bisque which was TO DIE FOR!  I have never had bisque so good!!!  Thanks Luke's !  I can't wait to go back!  With or without family/friends visiting :)",

I just tell myself you live in a city that gets over 40 million people every year. Anyways, before I over think about price again. Let's get down to the food, overall everything we had was delicious especially the clam chowder soup. It was thick and had descent size clams that paired well with the potatoes and flavor of the soup. Makes me missed San Francisco Fishermen Wharf. The shrimp roll was good and so was the grilled lobster sandwich. Everything was fresh and lived up to the sustainable quality you would expect from higher grade seafood. It's something I wouldn't go out of my way to eat at but for all it's worth the staff on duty was very friendly and accommodating! Plus it's nice to have a bit of a variety of food options at Nevada's largest shopping mall.  2017 Yelp Review #9",

I knew I was going to save this for lunch the day before leaving Vegas.  It was worth the anticipation and still days later I can't get it off my mind!!!   I ordered the Be My Valentine's Deal   $60  all the roll options 1/2: Shrimp, Lobster, Crab for 2 and 2 cups of Clam Chowder with a side of pure lobster tail solo.  2 Soda pops (went with the blueberry/lemonade)   Every bite was drenched in flavor!!!! I started with the crab it lit my eyes so bug with its bursting flavors! 2nd to go down was the lobster and it did not disappoint.  So clean fresh, and that butter sauce was a great addition! Lastly, the Shrimp oh! Boy!! The Shrimp! Not a bite got wasted! I was so stuffed from the sandwiches now on to the soup!! The Clam Chowder was served in a perfect portion size! The cup of soup was gone before I knew it!!!   The staff were nice! It's kept clean.  Small seating area meant to get in and out.  Rainy days prob won't work best here but if you are here and on this side of the strip its worth it for lunch/dinner or even a quick small snack!! This place is a Gem ready for you to come on over!",

Mind you, portion size is very small, but not out of the ordinary for seafood rolls. I think it's a good value because you don't have to fully commit to one type of roll and have later regrets if it doesn't taste the way you expected it to.  My favorite out of the three was the shrimp roll - not too overdressed and had a sweet, shrimp flavor to it. My least favorite was the crab roll which was a tad too pungent in smell/flavor.  We also added a side of clam chowder - good! But after a few bites, it became too, too salty.  Luke's Lobster is in Vegas is great. It satiated my desire to eat at its New York location, and inevitably, saved me a meal on my next trip to New York.",

    "text": "If I want a good lobster roll, this is where I go. Yeah, it is on the strip, but it is easily accessible from the smelly underground parking at Fashion Show Mall. Park in the red parking and go up the stairs to the outside restaurant area like you were going to Maggianos or RA Sushi. If you stay at street level and walk a little farther South, Luke's is a stand alone shack like place. You order at the counter and there is seating underneath the bistro string lights. Everything is completely outdoors, so be prepared for the weather!   What I love most is how fresh the seafood is, which is amazing considering we are hundreds of miles from an ocean. Also, seafood is the main focus, without being overwhelmed by sauce. The buttery, soft bread compliments the seafood well. I got the sampler, which are half sized portions of lobster roll, crab roll, and shrimp roll. My favorite was the lobster roll and I would get a full roll of this next time.   It's pretty pricey, but to be expected on the strip. Kind of nice to sit and watch the pretty lights of the Wynn and Palazzo and random passersby.  *****Yelp 2016 100 Challenge***** 13/100",

I had to call them to find their exact location   Overall, the lobster roll was pricey with a smaller portion but the roll was packed with lobster meat and so much taste!

I took one bite of the lobster roll and I was sold: the combo of the luscious pieces of lobster, the perfectly toasted roll and the fantastic seasoning was nothing short of amazing. Honestly these puppies show up in my dreams: happy dreams when I am eating them, nightmares when I picture never having them again.  In addition, although seating is rather limited, just a few seats next to the stall: the staff did serve us at our table and was friendly enough to share the contents of their seasoning.  Highly recommended and will certainly come back!",

This place serves lobster, crab, and shrimp roll. I only got the lobster one cause after trying so many rolls I realized that lobster is 100% my favorite. However, if I do get the chance to come back I'm definitely trying the other ones. I give this place 5 fat stars because Luke's Lobster does its bread so right--it's PERFECTLY toasted with just a little bit of crisp. With every bite you taste the butter soaked into the bread and the hot lobster...mmm..SO GEWD. It's an option to get your roll with soup--I highly recommend the New England clam chowder.",

This is a really small place along the Vegas strip in front of the Fashion Show Mall with uncovered outdoor seating for about 16 people max.  Price was about $70 for two lobster rolls, two large clam chowders, and two bottled sodas.  The lobster rolls are somewhat small, but loaded with lobster meat and no fillers, just quality lobster on a really good toasted and buttered piece of bread.  I would highly recommend this place if you don't mind the price and limited seating.",

The lobster definitely tasted fresh after biting into the scrumptious roll. They were out of clam chowder so I opted for the lobster bisque. It should join the pedestal the clam chowder sits on, very good. Prices were decent being its on the Vegas strip. I may just have to make the walk back over before heading home.",

I think greater than $20 for a few lobster tidbits is... ahem ... overpriced?  The meat was cold.  They probably kept it frozen to keep it from spoiling.  There really is no smell or flavor to the meat.  I'm sure it was fresh albeit frozen.  I had to dipped it in their cocktail sauce to bring out the taste.  I also tried their shrimp and crab roll.  Same deal.  Overall, if you have a fetish for these things I guess this place will do.  For me, I'd rather dine in restaurant and get warm, cooked lobster meat.",

    "text": "Okay this place was a waste of my time and money... Not sure why it has such a high rating on yelp because I totally regret spending my money there.    First, the place is small and cramped.  The outdoor patio is small, it has like 4 small cicular tables with a few chairs.  Secondly, one of the staff who was preparing the food was pretty rude.  The place is small and cramped and we were trying to look at the menu and decide what we want.  He was trying to hand the food over and around the counter to one of the customers and rudely asked my friend and her mom to pretty much get out of the way.  I understand maybe they were blocking the way but there is a nice way to ask....The lady at the register was nice though.  Okay now on to the food.  I ordered the lobster roll combo with the soup (clam chowder) and drink which came out to be about 29-30 dollars.  The lobster roll was maybe about 4 inches and not very much lobster.  The lobster meat comes out of a small bag that probably makes two lobster rolls.  I can tell you, I was so so disappointed and felt so bad bringing my friends there.  Spent so much money and wasn't even close to being full.  Also, the meat hardly had any flavor besides the powder seasoning they put on it.  Not tasty at all.  My friends order the truffle lobster roll and it tasted just like mine, what happened to the truffle oil???  The trio combo was just another let down.    To make it short and simple, I do not recommend this place to anyone unless you just want to try it and want to waste money on disappointing food!!!",

If you have trouble deciding, ask for a pictured menu or just go for the trio (you get all three proteins). The rolls are all dressed in one way: a little lemon butter, mayo, and seasoning, very simple, but highlights the taste of whichever protein you decided to choose.   The sandwiches are reasonably sized and priced compared to other restaurants who serve similar products. Seating is very limited if you decide to eat in, otherwise grab it to go.",

Don't let the size of the roll deceive you, because they stuff a whole lot of lobster meat in there, and being a regular at buying lobster at the grocery store.. this is the same amount (if not more) than you would buy for the same price just nowhere as fresh as Luke's. Plus you never find claw meat at the store, just tails. The bread was so soft and delicious, a perfect match for the delicious lobster. Their lemon butter was harmoniously balanced, and brought out the fresh flavor of the lobster. Parking is super simple, and Luke's is easily accessible. Park in BLUE parking under Nieman Marcus, preferably A's,B's, or C's... zoom up the escalator, and about 50 steps outside toward the doors at the side of the escalator facing Las Vegas Blvd. When you enter, you'll be greeted by the best group! Robbie, was so thorough at explaining the prices, and combos.. Javier hooked up my first roll, and YES! When I went back to get a \"to go\" order, Heather sold me on getting 3 more, plus the <a href=\"/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2Fbomb.com&s=bb4f996415a9c2f21137e27cfb68f439a48cec2652b53e9b50dd7e766dbe177e\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">bomb.com</a> coleslaw she had just made fresh that morning. If you're in the mood for some New England style grub, definitely check out Luke's Lobster. It's the real deal for seafood in the desert.",

Once we got to the hut after a long walk down the strip under the summer heat, the food was nothing short but amazing!   We got Luke's trio and a jumbo lobster roll, along with a side of coleslaw and iced tea. Bomb af!! They had a very nice toasted buttery roll and very generous shrimp, crab, and lobster portions. Our entire order for two people turned out to be about $50. In addition, the staff were friendly and seemed to really care about their customers.   Overall, great experience! The only downside is the seating area, which was located outside the hut with four tables, each next to a cement bench, under a tarp. Nonetheless, each had cute centerpieces.",

This place is hands-down, my favorite place to eat in LV. One, the employees are fun and up-beat, two, you can't go wrong with anything you order here. Unless of course, you don't eat seafood. If that's the case, this place is definitely not for you. Three, there is nothing pretentious or high-falutin' about the place. On my first visit, I got the sampler rolls. They consist of shrimp, crab, and lobster on mini rolls. After having that, this last visit I got just the lobster roll with the lobster bisque soup. Cold seafood salad, lightly seasoned on top of a yummy butter seared bread and delicious chunks of lobster in a buttery creamy broth. To. Die. For. It's a tiny place with limited seating and in no way fancy. The food though is better than almost any place I have been to in Las Vegas.  Did I mention it's shipped in fresh from the East coast or Canada?? They have a board that tells you where your seafood was shipped from locally. Get a roll and a beer and a cup of bisque. You'll be glad you did.",

    "text": "Luke's Lobster Las Vegas is a stand alone little eatery, located a the Fashion Show mall with it's own private outdoor seating (not dog friendly) and other additional outdoor seating surrounding it (if you do want to dine with your 4 legged friend like my husband and I).   I came by this place 2 Saturdays ago, a little before 12 pm. Only 1 employee was inside this tiny little place, behind the register. I looked over the paper menu and ended up ordering:    The Lobster Trap, $29 prior to tax- Oh boy, what an incredibly pricey meal. This is definitely a trap, the tourist kind. This entree comes with a lobster roll, 1/2 lobster tail and a cup of the lobster corn chowder. The size of the meal is good for 1 person. For the lobster roll, large buttery pieces of lobster is served on a piece of toasted white fluffy bread (not on a roll at all). I thought it was good but I would have preferred to have the butter omitted since a side of butter is served on the side so that I can choose to add it on my own (with as much of as little as I desire). The half lobster tail was okay. I thought the lobster corn chowder was average.  -------------------------- (Total= $31.39 after tax)  My husband was annoyed with me that I wanted to try this because of all the highly rated reviews. He scoffed at the price (but still ended up eating more than half of my meal).   The girl behind the counter had informed me that the outdoor seating is not dog friendly but the other tables outside around this eatery allows for me to be outside dining with my little girl dog. She said that she will have an employee come out and deliver my order to me.   Not too long of a wait, an employee came out to bring out my meal. He forgot to bring me napkins and a spoon. So he left and came back about 5 minutes later with 1 napkin and 1 plastic spoon.   Honestly, I thought the food was average. The price is pretty high for what I got. Granted, I know that seafood is pricey, but I have had better, especially at the price. And being in Sin City, there are buffets with good lobster tails where the admission price is ~$50.  I am sorry Las Vegas, but I was expecting better.   If you disagree with me, then so be it. At least you will have 1 less person to wait in line for to order your lobster roll.",

This is my first time here so they recommended the signature \"Lobster Roll\", but I want it to try it all, so I went for the Trio combos which is all of there Roll, which is Lobster, Crab, and Shrimp, also the clam chowder soup with a drink. Of cause the Lobster roll was the top notch, topped with hot butter and the toasted crunchy bread. I also like the shrimp roll but not the crab,because I am not a \"crabby\" guys. I love the decoration of the shop, it is small but is very cozy, that little patio outside is very comfortable to sit down and enjoy your meal.",

They give you a shitty portion!  Not worth it.  Will not recommend or go back.  Only thing saving this place are tourist on the strip that are hungry and don't know better.  I can guarantee of this was an off the strip food joint it would have been closed down a long time ago.",

All of the employees were sweet, welcoming and helpful with making a choice. I started off with the trio sampler combo that came with shrimp, crab, and lobster that came with a soup of your choice (I chose the lobster soup) and a drink. I'm not much of a soup person myself but that lobster soup was amazing! My favorite sandwich was the lobster by far but the shrimp and crab were also enjoyable! After having the trio I had to go back and get a full lobster sandwich! One thing that I enjoyed greatly were the portions! Most places would serve more bread than fish. But here at Luke's lobsters there was an equal amount of bread and fish! This will be my first stop the next time I am in Las Vegas! Thank you to the employees who assisted me and I am sorry that I do not remember your names..",

The roll seemed a bit overpriced for what it was and of course as I am always putting value into my ratings I gave 3 stars. It might have been 4 stars had I not spent 20 bucks on the lobster roll + more $$ for my sides. You will enjoy just beware of a bit of sticker shock..",

Three of my friends and I only got the chance to try the shrimp roll ($9), but it was so salty and cold. The bread was really good, but I have to say the texture and taste of the shrimp was something we were all not a fan of. The portion size is also not huge so this wouldn't be the place to go if you're trying to feast.  There were also lots of crickets in the seating area, which definitely reduced my appetite. Was not pleased with my experience :( But the food did come out really fast and the workers were quite friendly!",

It's a very teenee place. They can only seat about 10 people, maybe 12 (but that would be pushing it, really.)   We got 2 orders of Noah's ark and a couple of clam chowders.   The sandwiches were smaller compared to what I've had in other places. But the flavor completely made up for it.   The lobster was my favorite. The other two were as good as I predicted. Seasoning was perfect.   Didn't get to try the clam chowder, but I heard good things.   Staff was so friendly! We got confused when we got our orders, thinking we were missing a bowl of coleslaw, so they gave us another one for free. (When we realized we weren't missing anything, we told them immediately. They gave us the bowl for free anyway!)   4.5 stars. Definitely making a stop here next time I come visit...",

You order inside and then go outside to eat since there isn't any room inside.   The cashier was very friendly and informed us of the deal of the day. I believed it was $10 for shrimp lobster roll that day, so me and my boyfriend got that, one lobster roll $17, and one large clam chowder to share.   The clam chowder was rich and creamy, very tasteful and is something I would order again. 4/5  The shrimp and lobster roll were decent. The size of it was small and does not come with any chips. The last time I had a lobster roll was in San Francisco and it was a thick bread that opened up to clamp the lobster inside of it. This one was more of a bun and lot smaller. The bun was actually good though, toasted with butter. The lobster I believe wasn't warm, more on the colder side and I would prefer it to be warm. The shrimp wasn't memorable either. Overall, I give it a 3/5.",

We got their Luke's Trio which came with a Lobster roll, Crab Roll and Shrimp Roll. The seafood was pretty cold, not sure if it was supposed to be like that. In my opinion, I think our meal would've tasted better if all the rolls were piping hot, maybe toasted?  Don't take it the wrong way, we still enjoyed it very much. Just would've tasted better hot that's all. Workers were very nice and funny, we laughed and joke around back and forth. Definitely would come back and give this place another try.",

Response to your comment below:- What we got was not the size of a half roll, it was the size of a ritz cracker, I actually made a comment to the employees that you should post an actually picture or have a display of how small the rolls actually are. Your comment below was very sweet but when I was there and mentioned my concern, they didn't care., and spending 35$ for a meal that was a teaspoon of each was terrible.. I wouldn't go back.",

I enjoyed the clam chowder more than the bisque but they were both good. I really liked the pepper they have there at the table for you. The pepper was in a shaker and I put the pepper on everything I ate. We also added some sriracha on our sandwiches and it was really good with sriracha too.

I was just along for the ride and didn't know what to expect.   First off, the 2 girls working were darling so upbeat and answered any questions we had.   I ordered a grilled cheese with lobster, chips, coke and bottled water my total was $21 very decent for lunch in Vegas. My girlfriend got the lobster roll.   The lobster roll is served cold on a warm bun with warm butter drizzled over top. I tried a bite and It was delicious however I enjoyed my grilled cheese more.   The grilled cheese was super filling and had tons of lobster within it. I definitely feel like I got my money's worth on that of lobster.   Only downside of this place was the menu was super small and the eating area/patio was also very small only about 4-5 tables that could get crowded real quick I feel. Would definitely visit this place again in a heartbeat!!",

I really enjoyed the lobster roll but I liked the crab roll even more since I am a bit of a crab fanatic. Both rolls were stuffed with plenty of meat, which tasted fresh and was seasoned wonderfully. The clam chowder was everything I had hoped it would be and had tons of flavor. My only complaint was that I thought the size of the roll(about the size of a stuffed piece of sliced bread folded in half) did not match the price. I did a bit more research and noticed that the prices at this location was up to $4 more expensive than its locations in NYC. :(",

The boyfriend and I were just wandering around and couldn't decide where to eat (none of the options in the food court appealed to us).  Then there it was, located in a cute little kiosk next to the Flip Flop Shop.  You walk up to the counter and after you order, you proceed to the outdoor, open-sitting area that's connected to the kiosk WITH a lovely view of the Strip.  The staff members were all very friendly and accommodating! Since it was our first time, they described the different types of rolls they offered and how each combo differentiated from one another.   We opted for the Noah's Ark, since it was the recommended option for two people to share. It comes with two sets of lobster rolls, crab rolls, shrimp rolls, and a couple of crab claws. It's perfect for when you're on a date or if it's your first time trying out the place. We were able to sample all their menu items through this order and they were all great! My favorite was the lobster roll (as expected with the name of the store, haha). The seafood was topped with a spice that added the perfect kick PLUS the rolls were melt-in-your-mouth good with all their toasted buttery goodness.   However, as great as the crab and shrimp rolls were, I would probably order the lobster roll for next time. Noah's Ark had great sample sizes but now that I know what I prefer, I would rather just eat a larger lobster roll.  They also have unique bottled drinks! So give those a try as well. Overall, it was pretty pricey for me but hey, paying for quality!",

It wasn't busy when I was there, but I can imagine it would be hard to find a seat if there is more than 15 people in there.  I recommend that you stop by and try a roll here. It's not something I would spend the money on every day, but now I can scratch it off my list.",

    "text": "Las Vegas, the land of world-class lobster rolls served out of a kiosk in front of a mall.  It really is just a kiosk--a counter and small adjacent seating area with five small tables. But don't let that keep you away.   My husband and I got to the register and had a little panic over what to order--taste of Maine? Noah's ark? The man taking our order walked us through the various options and was super friendly and helpful...didn't rush us at all.  We settled on the Noah's ark ($52), which features a lobster roll, crab roll, shrimp roll, two pickles, and four crab claws with cocktail sauce, all divided evenly into two baskets, plus your choice of two bags of chips (Cape Cod kettle cooked potato chips--regular or sea salt and vinegar) and two drinks (bottled water, Main Root soda, or Luke's Maine blueberry lemonade).   The combo gives you a nice amount of food for each person. If you're starving, I guess you might want more, but I couldn't finish everything. The rolls are simple--toasted white roll, a bit of mayo, piled with shellfish, topped with drawn butter and a sprinkle of seasoning. Great bread-to-shellfish ratio, and plenty of butter, but not too much of anything to overpower the seafood. So delicious! There's Sriracha and shakers of seasoning on the tables, but you totally don't need it.   Maine root sodas are great--made with organic, cane juice. I opted for blueberry, because, you know, Maine. No flavors or anything, just blueberry juice. The lemonade is made with wildflower honey.   Pickle was totally meh--not crisp, but that's my biggest complaint, which is saying something!   I love that they have a chalkboard telling you where that day's lobster, crab, and shrimp came from.   The service was consistently excellent, from the person who took our order to the one who came by to check on us while we were eating.   Prices certainly aren't cheap, but it's Las Vegas, and you're getting great quality, delicious seafood. Don't miss it!",

It was only $7 more for the combo bringing the total to $24 each.  There's a little seating area next to this takeout restaurant.  If I were in town longer, I'd definitely go back again.",

It's a kiosk with minimal seating and not enough room inside to comfortably wait for your meal, unless you're okay with being hit by the door every few minutes.    The sandwich itself was pretty good, but not excellent by any means, so unless you're feeling like dropping $20+ just because, my advice is to pass!",

Went here the morning after a pretty rough night, so maybe the food would have tasted ten times better if I wasn't hungover, but I thought that my lobster sandwich was good but not exceptional. Most of all I think that towards the end of my chowder, I definitely tasted something weird.. as if I were eating sand. The sandwiches are pretty pricey (~$20) and if I were to do it again I'd honestly probably wouldn't eat a sandwich on my broke budget. Don't get me wrong though, it was still tasty, just a bit overpriced and nothing out of this world.   There's only a small area of seating with a few tables, but whoever designed the building didn't do the best job. My friends and I kept laughing about the total inefficiency of watching the server walk out of the kitchen to the strip, all the way back inside the front entrance and through the restaurant just to serve food at the patio and go back for each order. That's a total of six doors to go through and a lot of walking for every order, when they should have connected the kitchen to the patio through a door or made it more accessible for service.",

If you are looking for a bargain go somewhere else, if you are looking for a good sandwich that you can't find in most places give it a try. By golly, don't be surprised when you are paying a fair amount because ummm it is good quality seafood. I didn't know what to expect but I wish I would have tried more of their options, I could have easily managed to push down some soup at least. This is nowhere near anything I do on a regular basis but if I were in the area and felt like spending $50-$60 for lunch I'd go again.",

He waited in line for at least 30-60 minutes and by the time it was his turn, they were out of crab so they substituted it with shrimp.  Doesn't crab cost more than shrimp?  To me, it would of been fair if we received half lobster and half shrimp to make up the difference of the price.  How long does it take to boil seafood, mix it with seasoning and scoop it on bread?  Also, instead of receiving 2 orders, we received one order but I guess the good part was, we were only charged for one.   Also, the size of each roll is small to tiny.  A few bites and you're done!  In terms of taste, it was good but not worth the wait.  When it comes to seating, it's non-existence.  If you want to eat here, be prepare for the long wait and standing while you're eating.",

    "text": "\"Did I just really just pay $18.40 for THIS?\" I asked my friend as I opened up the cutesy tiny take-out box my lobster roll came in. It was the length of those regular sized hot dog buns you buy at the grocery store..but to be fair, it was filled generously with 1/4 lb of wild-caught lobster.   Now I'm no lobster roll connoisseur (this is my second time trying one - first was at Disneyland's Harbour Galley and it looked better than it tasted), but I like to think I can tell what's damn good food when I eat some. And this, this is a damn good lobster roll! You can ask them to exclude the butter, mayo, or spices from your roll and as much as I don't like overly-greasy things, I decided to try it as they would normally prepare it. And unless you're vegan or something, I would suggest you do the same. They're light handed with the lemon butter/mayo anyways - I literally saw them use a huge dropper to put it on.  Gotta hand it to New England for making the perfect buns..the inside is so pillowy and soft, with a lightly buttered toasted outside..it reminds me of Texas toast. Plus the split-top makes it way less likely to drop any pieces of the precious cargo loaded inside. The large chunks of lobster were chilled and while some people have mentioned they would prefer the lobster warm, I think it's more fresh tasting chilled. Put some sriracha on and sprinkled some more of their seasoning and it was pure perfection.  So was it worth it? Absolutely. Although it was small, it was ended up being quite satiating and in hind sight, I would much rather prefer that lobster to roll ratio with that quality than vice versa. Hell, even though I have a new-found allergy to lobster (noticed a rash all over my forehead when I got home), I'd come back for another one the next time I'm feeling spendy!",

When we got the lobster it didn't have much flavor and the butter dipping sauce was just melted butter with nothing special to it. I was expecting more flavor. What cancelled out any hope of flavor was it being cold and sitting in a damp shell. I'm sure it has a different taste during what seasons, but to us it was bland. If you want excellent flavor lobster try Lobster Me. All lobster is hot in any for they have and they add different flavoring to it to make it fantastic.",

It's a tiny little shack, but based on the reviews, even a line down the street wouldn't have deterred us.    Thank goodness, all was quiet, and we immediately ordered 1 Taste of Maine for $26: 1 mini lobster roll, 1 mini crab roll, and 1 mini bay shrimp roll,  2 small Jonah crab claws, 1 pickle, 1 bag o chips or side o slaw, and 1 drink.  The idea was we'd order this to share, and then order more of whatever roll we ended up liking.  So anyway, slight complaint: they only have regular chips and salt and vinegar chips.  I guess that's all you need but....we're in Vegas.  I want more choices, damn it.  The drinks were bottled and unique and cold.  Boyfriend chose a Ginger Brew drink that was natural and had a really nice ginger zing.  I ate a crab claw and took one bite of the shrimp roll and said, forget it, I'm getting my own, and immediately went back to the counter to order my own sampler, this time with slaw and a honey blueberry lemonade (SO GOOD, but more for sipping, less for washing down shellfish).   We both gulped down our food in their cute little patio dining area that was nicely covered by umbrellas.  I thought we'd still be hungry but we were pleasantly full.  Besides, we had a steak dinner to go to in a mere 6 hours.  The stand out for me was actually the bay shrimp roll.  But all the seafood was beautifully fresh, wonderfully seasoned and the bread was perfectly toasted and buttered.  Yummy balance of salty, sweet, briny, buttery....mmmm.... The pickle was great.  The drinks I mentioned.  The slaw was.....strange....a kind of mayo-less, vinegar, honey-mustard concoction.  I'd skip it next time.  Maybe some people like it.  Anyway, can't wait to return.  Good stuff, yo.",

It is a small hut and seating is outdoors. But the food makes up for that. The prices are high for the amount of food you get. But after going to other lobster places, I will probably go for the Noah's Ark next time just to try it out. Oh, and they get your order right unlike other places previously mentioned!",

Their crab roll and their clam chowder are super delicious and I love how they serve some really great soda glass bottles. The issue about this place is that it is super overpriced. For two people, you're looking at spending $60 on food only to have to take a stop by a fast food place or something because their portions won't satisfy your hunger. It is a great snack, so my advice, don't come here hungry. However, I still highly recommend trying this place because their food is really good!",

    "text": "As someone who frequented Luke's Lobster locations in NYC while I lived there, I was mildly disappointed in their Las Vegas location.  I just got back from lunch and am thinking to myself, \"was this really Luke's?\" - Something has been lost in the trip from the east coast to LV, I think.  I went with my usual, the Taste of Maine (because I'm greedy) and, while the service was great, and the seafood seemed fresh, it just... Wasn't as good as back east... I felt the rolls may have benefited from slightly more seasoning, and the rolls did not seem to have the same resistance to soggyness.  Maybe a touch too much mayo?   I couldn't really put my finger on it, but, I was mildly underwhelmed in comparison.  That's not to say I didn't enjoy my meal - On the contrary, I quite enjoyed it. Since moving from the east coast, Luke's Lobster is one of the fast casual chains that I missed. And it was still enjoyable. Even with the price hike (again, not sure if that's because it had to be transported to Vegas, or, prices have just raised since the last time I was in NYC, or, if it's just a \"we're in Vegas now, so, Vegas prices\" inflation.)",

Some people get weirded out by the warm bread and cold lobster.  It never bugged me at all though.  This is my perfect lobster roll.  I really don't like the slaw here.

It was a little hard to find just because it's in an enclosure in front of the mall in the middle of the sidewalk so depending on what direction u were walking to it determined if u could find it.  The food was really good so I am still giving it 4 stars, but reluctantly because of the conditions of the seating area. There was a couple eating in there when we got there but all the other tables were vacant and filthy!!! Maybe there were coming out of a rush but in my opinion they didn't look busy enough for that to be an acceptable excuse.",

They are very generous with their meat portions and the meat taste so fresh. This particular location is extremely small, but the quality of the food is still just as good. It is located right in front of the mall entrance. If you're not walking on the strip, I would suggest parking in Macy's lot and walk through the mall to get here!

My boyfriend was pretty shocked when I told him I've never had Luke's and he was like lets go in and try. We were walking out of Fashion Show after shopping and trying to walk back to Palazzo.  He said his favorite is Crab but his friends from NY likes Lobster the most, so he ordered a Luke's Trio to try all three different flavors; Lobster, Crab and Shrimp. We took a seat outside and it was all full except one table. Ot was around 3:30 PM and I was surprised to see this small place full.  Our Luke's Trio came out not too long after. Its rather a sampler size so quarter pound of each flavors. Their bread though! It was so buttery and crispy, I think the bread is what makes these rolls so yummy and delicious!! I took a bite of Crab and oh my..it was so soft, flavorful and moist! With the crisp bread, it was a perfect combination. Lobster was also so juicy, chewy and oh so fresh! I enjoyed Lobster just as much as Crab. Shrimp was also good but I will definitely choose Crab or Lobster. I know some people may think its pricey but I think its worth it to every penny!  Service provided by the staff was phenomenal. She was so friendly, polite and sweet. I really loved everything about this place. Convenient location, delicious food and amazing staff! TRY IT when you need a snack or when you are near Fashion Show after shopping for hours!",

The bread was soft and buttery. The corn chowder was good and there were bits of lobster in it. However, I can barely taste the lobster in the soup. It was still good, but I think the clam chowder would be a better choice for me.  The only issue that I have was the size of the roll. It was smaller than I expected and it does not fill me up, especially for the price they are offering. Overall, I would go back and try their other rolls such as their crabs or shrimps one.",

    "text": "I found Luke's Lobster through a fellow Yelper and am so glad I did!  It's hard when you live or are visiting in the middle of the desert to find some great seafood, however Luke's offerings of lobster crab and shrimp rolls are full of ingredients and delicious!  Unfortunately though, when I say that they are full, that doesn't mean that they are filling.  My partner and I found LL pretty easily - a cute little outside 'hut' at Fashion Show with it's own private seating at the back of it. We each ordered a roll and a large clam chowder to share. We really wanted to try their lobster mac n cheese, although despite their website saying it was available from November, this was not the case.  We thoroughly enjoyed our rolls - the crab was good, but the lobster was what it was all about, juicy, seasoned well and so tasty! The toasted rolls were also very good. The only bad thing was that these rolls are quite small, but are priced so that we expected something a little more substantial. Because of this, we weren't nearly full afterwards, so we ordered the lobster grilled cheese, which wasn't as filled with lobster as the rolls, but was good nonetheless.  By the end of our meals, we weren't hungry anymore and the food was delicious. However, because of the smaller sized items and having to purchase more, a bill for two people, no drinks was over $50.   Also, as a non-smoker who tries to avoid the smell at all costs, it was a little frustrating that the outside (and pretty much only) seating backed straight on to a public smoking area. Because of this, we couldn't take our time as much as we wanted and rushed through our meal a little faster to avoid more smoke smell wafting into where we were eating.  In all, the food is great and service is good. We would definitely return for the rolls. But at the price you pay for the size you get, this would for sure be a treat for us!",

We got there a little too late, 4:45 pm, and they ran out of all soups. My husband and I ended up ordering the trio and figured we would share it as it is expensive. For an order of trio combo that came with a drink and chips, I went ahead and ordered chips and water for myself. My total came out to $32.   As we waited, we quickly grabbed a table on their small covered patio which consists of 5 tables that seats two each.   Not to long after, our meal was delivered. Each sandwich was really good and filled. Unfortunately, the size of each sandwich is about half the size of a hot dog bun. So this was but only a snack for us.   The restaurant and dining area is clean, customer service was good as well as the sandwiches. Price is pretty high but it was a good experience overall.",

    "text": "Oooooooooohhhhhhhhhh! Who traveled to Sin City in search of a roll? SpongeLuke Lobster pants..And as you can see THAT's why I haven't quit my day job to nab that opening act gig on the strip..Haha  What isn't a joke however is Luke's Lobster nestled outside of the Fashion Show Mall. I really had my heart set on finding a decent lobster roll in Vegas to satisfy my Slapfish craving while away from Cali and boy did I find that here!  They have the staples: crab, lobster, and shrimp rolls and a few other seasonal items so certainly it swabs anyone's seafood poop deck. I continuously keep being hooked on the Luke's trio. It's basically three half rolls of crab, lobster, and shrimp for a modest $20 price tag however from the consistency it feels like it should be $200 (don't ever do that please) haha. What stands out is the quality and freshness. The shrimp has been one of the most tender I have tried to date and the lobster/crab are not reeking of water or salty displeasure so Luke definitely uses the force to hone his craft! I would say their secret seasoning blend is the coup de gras though as it just seems to always elevate the rolls to new heights!  A dark horse in all this ironically enough was the beverages. Ever since I first gave it a sample I have been head over heels for the blueberry lemonade. It comes in a bottleneck so it looks like I was getting hammered without the after effect, but wow between the blueberry and honey mix did that TKO my tastebuds! That certainly is a highly recommended item to snag.  So as the lighthouse dims the searchlights on the strip follow the buoys to Luke's as you will not regret it! The overall experience will leave you scaling the seven seas for your sea legs.",

We enter, employees were talking amongst themselves & left us standing there for a good 8-10 minutes before we could even order b/c one of the other employees was putting some order into their system (that's cool and all but let your customers know!) we order a simple lobster roll and extra half tail, they tell us to wait outside. We wait and wait and wait and watch as other folks get their food before us with the same exact food!! We go ask where our food is b/c from where I'm sitting I see them talking amongst themselves AGAIN! Look Luke's I like your food a lot but if you are going to have inconsistent service like this where you need to wait a good 20 min for a roll I'll just go to a fast food joint. I had planned on ordering another roll, but due to the 'wait' I would rather not!!",

The clam chowder was decent, not as creamy as I'd like but my daughter enjoyed it.   For a lobster roll on the Las Vegas strip, I guess the price was about on point for what I'd expect to pay. Not sure I'd make this place a habit to come back to but I will bring family who come to visit and want a lobster roll",

Directly in front of Neiman Marcus, if your not on foot and park in the garage it's about a 7-9 minute walk through the mall.   My experience at Lukes was meh. It's a Subway style packaged meal with a free drink and a bag of chips. At least our meal was, I ordered the \"Taste of Maine\" for $27 (thier website says $24). It's 3 small rolls of shrimp, crab, lobster, 2 crab claws and a pickle (they forgot my pickle). The seafood isn't mixed with mayo or other crap which is awesome, I like it raw dogs, and they give you cocktail sauce on the side.   The lobster was really good, it was the best of the three rolls. The crab I felt was ground up to much as there was no chunks at all. The shrimp was OK, bay shrimp. IMO for $27 the quantity was not enough, I walked out sill hungry. And aside from them dropping your food, you do all the work, it's fast food.   It's outdoor seating which was fine but when it gets over 100 degrees I don't know if I'd be out here or anyone else would for that matter. It's a tourist trap, I am not a cheapskate but I went with wifey and spent almost $50 on lunch and we were still hungry. The guy that took my order was extremely friendly though, and if your in a rush it's a quick expensive meal.",

Please stop doing that. It's sacrilegious.   Also: Skip the clam chowder. It's crap.",

    "text": "On our last night in Vegas, I was looking for something different instead of a sit down restaurant. I've always loved lobster roll and saw this place had great reviews so I figured why not give it a go. I was not disappointed. This restaurant is small and is completely outside. You order from a kiosk and can sit at the little seating area. The worker was very friendly, and my love and I each ordered the lobster roll ($17) and each added on a drink and chips ($5). The worker turned on the heat lamp above our table so we could stay warm during the chilly night. He also told us not to hesitate if we had any questions about the menu. I liked the sodas they offered, I had a blueberry and my boyfriend had the root beer. The chips were made by Cape Cod and were tasty. Our lobster rolls came out in no time and were so succulent, it was hard for us to eat slow! Luckily for us, the worker told us there's a Luke's Lobster location in our hometown of Philadelphia! The only complaint I have is that I wish the lobster roll had a little more lobster in it considering the price. We will definitely be visiting our hometown location next.",

After we ordered, they asked if we'd like a sample of the soup and gave us a sample of both lobster bisque and another one (can't remember as it was a while back when we visited). They said if we didn't want it they would've had to throw it out so it sounds like they make their soups fresh daily. The half sandwiches were on the small side but very fresh and tasty. The soups were thick and also very good. I would recommend stopping in if you are a seafood lover.",

I see a lot of reviews about the price but it was right in line with what i'm used to in Dallas. 16- 20.00 for a lobster roll is the norm.  I got the taste of maine (27.00). 1/2 shrimp roll, 1/2 lobster roll, 1/2 crab roll with 2 huge claws. I was pleasantly surprised. It was very fresh. The rolls super buttery and slightly sweet. The rolls were truly authentic...definitely something you would get in the northeast. The Cape cod chips and Luke's Maine Blueberry lemonade were a hit with my family also.  The only thing I didn't like was the outdoor seating and birds and bird poop. But i get it....didn't deter me from going back later and getting a lobster roll to go.",

So I've had Luke's in NY before and was excited to try this place out again with my LA friends who's never been to Luke's before.  I remember Luke's lobster rolls and chowders were really really ecstatically good and so I must have it again.  It didn't disappoint but it wasn't as good as I remembered.  Lobster rolls are a big thing in LA now and almost 9 out of 10 seafood restaurants serve lobsters rolls in LA so maybe that's why. Can't say I have had better and I'd return if I was in the mall but my friends felt that the warm lobster rolls from LobsterME in PH that servers Warm butter+ warm lobster+ crunchy soft rolls are better.  So I guess it's personal preference on how you like your rolls!  One thing tho, although it's patio seating, the staffs are unsure about us bringing the dog with us and the owner was really nice and let us do that for this time.. But isn't patio seating supposed be pet friendly? Anyways, friendly new staffs and owner!",

Make it a combo and get some Cape Cod chips, and if you are hungry grab some clam chowder.   Overall 4.5/5  P.S.

I was super stoked and excited to know this was just across the street from my destination. I'm a big fan of lobster but I have never had a lobster roll so really didn't know what to expect. So I arrive at the parking garage and then go try to find a restaurant or so I thought. It was a little confusing even after using the directories in the fashion shops entrances but eventually made my way to the lobster kiosk. Sorry, but that was my first impression when I was standing in front of it about to drop a $20 bill on a 5/6 ounce lobster sandwich. I decided oh what the heck, manned up and ordered my lobster roll. While waiting I found a small little round table in a cubby in the back of the kiosk and waited patiently which didn't take long for my smaller than anticipated lunch. First bite I thought wow this is pretty good. Second bite it was almost like I could taste the freshness and was happy with the overall texture and melody of flavors that were in the sauce. Third bite I was really wishing there was more to this roll than what appeared to be one final bite remaining. Another couple bites and I think it would've been a great value however I am still satisfied but probably won't go back just because to me it was one of those \"been there done that\" type of establishments so to speak. I gave it four stars because it was very delicious only lacked a star because I was expecting a little bit more of a restaurant style setting for $20 roll (aka half sandwich). Heck just another five minutes walk north you can get the best tacos in Vegas for just over two dollars each.",

From what I remember, the NYC kiosk was in a fancy shopping mall's food court. It was fancy, lively, hip, and fun. This LV kiosk is small, right in front of the Fashion show mall, and looks somewhat sad.  I got Noah's Ark and 2 big cups of clam chowder for almost $80, which just barely enough for the three of us. We didn't care for the shrimp roll, and thought it would be more enjoyable to get the soup combo for the crab or lobster. The included crab claw is also tiny, it is fresh but nothing special.",

We decided to order the lobster rolls and took a seat. Our food had finally arrived and I was so excited to eat it!   There were big chunks of lobster tail and claw meat lightly seasoned with mayo and spices, paired with a toasted bun. The bun was warm and the lobster was chilled. It was light, yet decadent.

The outdoor seating only have 4 tables. I wouldn't sit there on a summer day.   I ordered the lobster roll combo with a soup and chose Coleslaw over chips. They had two kinds of soup, clam chowder or lobster bisque. I picked clam chowder which I thought was just okay. It had big chunks of clams and it tasted good, but I felt the soup was a little watery for my taste. I would try the lobster bisque next time I am back in town. The Coleslaw comes in a small cup in your tray. The slaw is mustard based which I liked. The lobster roll was very very good! It was better than one of their other chain in New York City. I also went to their original store in New York and thought this place was just as good! I am glad they are able to maintain their quality. The drinks are all available in a fridge where you can pick what you want yourself after you have ordered and paid.   Service was great, nice and friendly. After I was done, but still drinking my soda, someone came and asked me if I was done and cleaned my tray for me. I thought that was nice because they didn't have to do that.",

I have had many a good lobster roll to include several in Maine.  Luke's lived out to the Maine lore by providing a delicious Lobster Roll.     The Lobster was plentiful and was sweet and fresh.  The roll was slightly sweet and the added spice gave the roll an amazing taste.  We got the combo to include Lobster bisque and one of their specialty drinks.  It came out to $75 for the three of us but to me the Lobster Roll was worth every penny.  The Lobster bisque was good but not in the same league as the Lobster Roll.  Nice and creamy but a little too light on the Lobster and just didn't have the great taste I expected.      Our meals came with bottled drinks from Maine.  They were all very good and added to the overall experience.  The highlight was definitely the Lobster Roll which I am still craving.  Looks like a strip visit is in my near future.  The staff was awesome and the service was perfect.  This is a small stand on the lower level of the Fashion Show Mall facing the strip.  It is a great location to people watch and take in the craziness that is the daily grind of the strip.  Looking forward to my next Lobster Roll - thanks Luke's!!!",

We discovered this place in Boston and were pleasantly surprised to come upon them in Las Vegas at the fashion show mall. They are a little on the expensive side for a sandwich but compared to the lousy $18.65 turkey bagel sand I got at the Seattle Airport last weekend,  I'd pay for Luke's any day if the week!",

I had looked up places before we got to Vegas and a lot of times your let down when you actually get the food but here my only complaint was that I didn't get more of it! Me nd my husband got the lobster roll and the lobster grilled cheese. The roll was INCREDIBLE. So yummy, the grilled cheese was also so good but it contained a lot less Lobster! We had a ton of questions and the cashier answered them with ease and a smile on his face! It was super hot so it was a bummer they didn't have an inside but we were told they are putting up misters so that should really help out since it does get pretty hot out there!  I will for sure be back next time we are in town!",

That they've lowered their prices since my initial visit 6-7 weeks ago is a plus, too. If I could eat here daily...I would.   This time around I opted for the lobster roll only and I was stuffed by that alone.   I've realized the secret to eating here: go during the week after 5pm. The mall is dead & underground parking at Macys/Neimans in the blue section make for an easy peasy in/eat/out experience. (The escalators by Macys/Neimans/Ann Taylor/Bare Minerals is where I'm describing....entering parking garage from Spring Mountain at Macys...park on the right once you enter the garage in Blue section.)",

There are just about 4-5 small tables outside but we were lucky enough to find seating as soon as we walked to the patio area.  I couldn't decide what roll I wanted, so I went for the Luke's Trio - 1/2 sizes each of the lobster, crab and shrimp rolls.  The sandwiches are fairly small but they are loaded with seafood goodness and quite filling!  We also couldn't pass up on the $5 lobster tail so we got one of those as well. Everything was really fresh and super tasty!  I'll definitely be back!",

    "text": "From what I understand, this is a very popular chain on the east coast and they recently added this location in front of the Fashion Show mall on the Vegas strip because why not. I am really hoping they make their way here to Seattle because their food is fantastic and would be a very interesting addition to our already bountiful seafood scene. They normally have really long lines at any of their locations but, since I was in Vegas during a cold stretch in January, I was able to walk right up with no waiting at all.  Their location is outside the mall in a super cool little space that has a small (heated) outdoor seating area that was just perfect for when I was there. The cold weather was not going to stop me from diving into what looked like a very promising meal. I ordered the crab roll, a cup of clam chowder, and a bottled root beer soda. All of their ingredients are sourced from very specific partnerships that they cultivate and maintain so you know you are getting the best and freshest ingredients available and you can really tell from the moment you take that first bite.  As I jumped head first into my sandwich, I was really impressed with the flavors and how everything went together perfectly. The toasty roll was held up really well and had a great balance with the pike of chilled crab meant that was stuffed into it. They serve it in a nice little holder that helps to keep everything from falling apart. The clam chowder was also really good with lots of fresh tasting ingredients and a good amount of clams which is often not the case depending on where you go.  I was able to chat with one of the ladies that worked here and found out she is originally from Washington state, I can't remember where, and she would love to see Luke's Lobster make it's way up there as well. She was really fun to talk to and I learned a lot about the company as she was more than happy to sing their praises...I mean, in an honest way, not because she had to as an employee.",

I ordered the crab roll, which was really good. My husband ordered the lobster roll, which was mainly claw meat. FYI: it's an additional $5 for a lobster roll.   For two tiny rolls, it came out to be $30 or so. For an additional $30, you can grab dinner with a show at Benihana and actually have a full meal.",

    "text": "Whatevs! That's all I'm gonna say about that.  Well, not really!!!  I must admit, I love seafood! While this place sells just that, I was less than impressed.  It's super pricey for what you get.  Granted we are in Vegas and not Maine or Nova Scotia but common people...  Sitting just out in front of Neiman Markus, outside just steps from the fabulous Las Vegas Strip.  I'd suggest parking in the \"Red Section\" underground.  There are escalators to take you inside the Fashion Show Mall then just head towards the Strip outside the actual mall.  I'm a little weary of what will happen once the summer hits.  It's gonna be way to freaking hot to sit outside and enjoy your meal.  Luke's is a pretty cool concept.  It's basically a fast food seafood spot.  Quick service at its best.  They basically offer 3 sandwiches on a buttery toasted roll.  You have the option of lobster (duh!!), crab or shrimp.  They do have a pricey special that allows you to sample a half of all 3 along with a few crab claws....all that AND a bag of chips.  That's what my husband, Cesar Q. decided on.  He stood in sticker shock when the guy told him our bill was $54 for a meager lunch.  Oops...sorry babe, it was my idea to stop by today.  Anywhoooo I had the soup and sandwich combo that came with a drink and you guessed it, a bag of chips!!  Pretty cool they allow for a bottled water at no additional cost.  I chose the shrimp roll and the lobster bisque.  Both were just so/so.  I did like that these sandwiches were not \"salad style\" so there was a simple smear of mayo on the roll as opposed to all the seafood being drenched in dressing.  The sammy was fresh but nothing to write home about, sorry Mom!  The service was stellar and on point.  The guy helping was genuine and made me feel like he loves his job!  In today's entitled society it's nice to see people still care about service.  There is a very small outdoor dining area attached to this little spot.  There are maybe 5-6 tables and a log cement bench area.  I did not think it was cool that they had a place to tip.  Holy hell...I just paid you $54 for a sandwich lunch, fast food to boot!   Needless to say, we won't be running back for lunch anytime soon.",

I am picky when it comes to slaw and boy was theirs good! It was light and crisp - not mayo based. The little patio is very cute and semi-private. Fresh cut flowers were at the tables and it was completely shaded. My favorite roll was the crab, but of course I had to get some lobster, too. Lots of fresh meat on both with no fillers. My meal was less than $40 - for fresh seafood on the strip that's not too bad! Please open a Luke's in Denver!",

It was perfect for me because I don't like any sauces to cover the flavor of the lobster. It is a very small portion, like other reviews mention, but the bread/lobster ratio is very good. The bread is light and perfectly toasted with butter. Usually I skip the bread carbs, but this roll is a nice complement to the lobster. The half lobster tail isn't large, but it's nice and simply prepared.",

If you're tired of places who pollute their so called lobster rolls with mayo or other junk, you need Luke's Lobster rolls in your life.  Located just outside Fashion Show Mall, you don't come here for the ambiance or to people watch. Their little shack has limited outdoor seating so dress warm during chilly weather. They also offer clam chowder and lobster bisque. Their rolls are about $19 so it can get pricey if you're extra hungry, but you'll taste the quality in the first bite.",

    "text": "I ordered the Lobster Roll and a piece of lobster added on for $5. When the staff said lobster tail for $5, I was expecting a whole lobster tail and not a half one. That's still okay since lobster is expensive.  Location is convenient for dining, especially after a walk around the mall.   So, to begin, the lobster tail was cold. Not frozen but definitely cold. I'm used to warm lobster tail so this was different and I prefer warm. I like that it came with some butter for dipping. No complaints about the butter since... it's butter. haha  Now, the roll is indeed small and a bit pricy, but like other Yelpers, I agree that they stuff the roll with lobster meat. There is definitely a ton of flavor from the toasted buttery roll to the mixture of lobster meat and sauce.  The price was $17 for the roll and $5 for the half lobster tail. I also tipped since it was brought to me by the staff.  In my opinion, I wasn't really full from the meal but I enjoyed it. Overall, a 4-star joint that I would try once but not go back to. I should explain what I mean- I'm not from Vegas so I rarely come back anyways. When I do come back, I tend to try new places unless the restaurant blew me away. This was not a blown-away experience but it was still good.",

    "text": "After seeing friend's Instagram, Facebook, & Yelp post on Luke's Lobster & reading Yelp reviews, I had this place bookmarked and it was a must that I go here. On the first day of vacation in Sin City, I mentioned to my other half, lets go to Luke's Lobster, but he wanted Asian food,   Next day, I mentioned, lets go to Luke's Lobster, no luck again and again, up until the last day of my Vegas vacation, I asked again, and then my wish came True. I was super Excited and Happy!!   The last time I had lobster roll and clam chowder this awesome, was in Seattle's Pike Place.    Luke's Lobster is located in front of the Fashion Show Mall. Don't look for a restaurant type of place like I did. Its a cute food stand right in front of the Mall. If you are headed straight to Luke's Lobster like me, it is going to be a walk from the parking lot. I think the closest to Lukes is parking near Macy's. After looking at directory, it still took us awhile to get to Luke's Lobster, can you tell I really want to have my Lobster roll badly?!  When I finally made it to Luke's Lobster, I was SO Happy, I've been waiting since January/2017!! This is such a cute place, there is a cute dining area in the back of the shop with 5 tables. Enjoy your food there and you can listen to the outside music from the Fashion Show Mall. It took me awhile to finally decide, the staff was very friendly and really gave me great suggestions and answered all of my questions. The menu is short and simple. One of the great suggestion by staff was to get the trio.    The only thing I regret during my visit was not having a feast, since we already had a big lunch  and about to have buffet dinner, this visit was just late afternoon snack. We ordered the clam chowder and lobster roll & paid 5.oo more to make it a combo with drinks and chips. Oh my goodness!! What we just had went so great together and WOW, the lobster roll  was so delicious, (lobster so fresh & juicy from Maine, seasoned just right, the rolls are filled with tons of lobster). This was the best Lobster Roll I ever had. I could taste the difference from all the lobster rolls that I've eaten, nothing comes close to Luke's. The clam chowder was very tasty also. The drinks got were organic lemon lime from Maine, which was so perfect.   After our meals, I was one happy wife, thanks so much to my other half for taking me.   Over-all, it was worth waiting for, worth every penny spent at Luke's, and I wish I visited more than once during my vacation. My other half enjoyed his meal too!! Now even after typing this review I am missing Luke's Lobster badly. - for now, I'll just have to live by the wonderful memories thru my photo until I visit Sin City again.   I totally recommend Luke's Lobster!!  #32/100 for 2017",

    "text": "My boyfriend was craving a lobster roll for the past few months (literally), but we couldn't find anywhere back home to get a good one. Flash forward to our trip to Vegas this March. I typed in \"lobster roll\" onto Yelp and this was the first place that popped up. Prior to checking this place out, I wasn't really a seafood/lobster fan...but after reading the wonderful reviews on about this place, I knew I had to at least give it a try.  Although unassuming, Luke's Lobster truly delivers an excellent, high-quality lobster roll. The simplicity of the dish - a quarter pound of fresh Maine lobster with just a hint of lemon butter on top of perfectly toasted sourdough bun - really allowed the freshness of the lobster to shine through. Like I mentioned before, I'm not the hugest seafood fan. However, this lobster roll has legitimately changed my opinion of seafood for good. Every bite of lobster had so much flavor in it...so juicy, tender, and very, very fresh. After this experience, I can't go back now. I think I might be a seafood (or at least lobster) fan for life!   $17 for a small roll might seem a bit expensive, even for Vegas. But trust me: Even though the roll looks small, the quarter pound of lobster meat on this baby really fills you up. My boyfriend and I were both starving and thought a lobster roll each would tie us over just for a little bit, but we were full for quite some time after finishing.  TLDR: Check this place out. You won't regret it. Absolutely delicious.",

Freshness was palpable and the order I got was not skimpy, but portion was overpriced and I was just distinctly underwhelmed. I guess I thought what I received would be comparable in size/quality to what I got in a touristy area in Boston, but the only similarity was the high price.  Went in for the winter special, a truffle lobster sandwich- online menu said $18, add fries for $3. On site price was $19, no fries available (small location has no fryer). Sandwich was ready in mere seconds, fresh lobster bits tossed with truffle oil. Nearly $20 for a three-inch roll without any sort of garnish (you can request a pickle spear), no sides. Fresh, yes, but also underwhelming.",

    "text": "Yes!  The best thing about this place is it a small 1 room joint as you're walking on the strip past Fashion Show and can be in, eat, and out in a few minutes!  But you get DELICIOUS, succulent lobster!    We got the 6 oz Jumbo Roll and loved it.  For 250 cal a half it was a lovely snack.  The bread had a good toast to it, and the lobster was moist, just a touch of butter, and plenty of meat.  I would have preferred a tad bit larger piece of bread to hold all that meat, but that's just our opinion.  It was a bit pricey at $26 for the roll, but we just wanted a snack and split it.  Absolutely delicious, fun staff and loved the small feel in big Vegas!",

We couldn't decide on what we wanted to try so we decided to get the lukes trio that came with a little of everything for $29. It came with a half roll of lobster, crab, and shrimp and a side of soup( we got clam chowder) and a drink.  Hubby and I decided to share this one combo. Everything was fresh and delicious. My favorite was actually the crab roll. But at $29 for the trio we decided to just get one and share. It's pretty pricey and portions are small. But if you are craving seafood and don't mind the price for a small snack, give it a try!",

But the hands down most delicious one was actually the CRAB ROLL!  Would highly recommend, though be aware the place is very small inside with only 2 stools to eat at, so most people eat at one of the shaded tables outside.  Luke's is located right across the street from Wynn.  The staff members at Luke's -- Robbie, Trey, and Heather -- were super friendly and welcoming.",

The sandwiches are about the size of a hot dog and come with no side (fries would be great) so if you're really hungry, this would only be a snack for you.",

I'm really into seafood and Yelp led me to this small restaurant on fashion mall. The customer service was awesome and warm. My food came up quickly. I tried the treehome which was the shrimp roll, the lobster roll, and the crab roll, all with a drink and chips for under $20. I love crab so I thought it would be my favorite but indeed it end up being the shrimp roll! All three were superb. However, it was the shrimp roll that blew my breath away! I HAD to buy one to take back to my room. I never do that but it was needed. I had the shrimp roll at the hotel that night and it was still as yummy as my 1st bite in the store! Try Luke out; you will not be disappointed at all!",

It was called the cockroach of the ocean!  We got the trio sampler and substituted the shrimp roll for a 2nd lobster roll. I wasn't overly impressed with the food. And given the price of 28$ including tip for what's pictured; it's not a very good deal.   I felt like the bread was actually the highlight. For me, I'd rather just eat lobster by itself with butter. Maybe my expectations were just too high. Either way, I can live without Luke's.  The seating is not good for how busy this place gets. We lucked out and grabbed a table, but the employees told me that we had to get our food to-go because of how busy it was.",

The Bisque had a few pieces of lobster in it as well and was very flavorful almost buttery tasting. For our drinks we tried the blueberry lemonade and the root beer both pretty good. Would recommend this place if you need a lobster roll fix. The restaurant itself and seating area are very small. Great customer service!",

I loved that every bite was filled with lots of potato and generous chunks of clam, it was very hearty and bursting in flavor, and it wasn't heavy on the cream. Just a really well-balanced clam chowder. It was a perfect complement to the cute outdoor setting in the Vegas winter.   Which reminds me: Luke's Lobster is its own little kiosk outside. I was super hangry and lost for a good 10 minutes looking for this place. But definitely worth the hunt!",

When getting there (15 min before closing time) I found 2 great employees that took the time to answer ALL of my questions, explaining about every dish, and recommending their favorites.   Overall a very good solid 4 stars experience.  1. Great service! Super friendly staff. Casual and yet professional.  2. Yummy food!  3. Quick.  4. Unfortunately I feel it's a little bit overpriced.",

First off everyone that works there are super friendly and very helpful.   I liked the location and design of the building. It's a very small place, maybe that's why I liked it. Once you park in the garage, it's really no problem getting to Luke's, I thought it was gonna be difficult, and it wasn't.   I thought the lobster roll was excellent. but it's also the first Maine lobster roll I have ever had. But everything worked, the toasted buttered bread. They only put a little mayo on, so you can still taste the lobster.   I think their prices are fair, it is lobster flown in from Maine, also I think they give you a nice portion of lobster.   So I would come back next time I'm in Vegas. I like how it's not a big fancy restaurant but you still get to taste some great lobster.",

    "text": "Vegas is now blessed with a branch of the East Coast chain of Luke's Lobster. This chain specializes in lobster rolls sourced with fresh ingredients, although they serve other seafood rolls and soup too. They operate in a tiny standalone shop outside the strip side of the Fashion Show Mall near the Wynn walkway.  This reminds me of my trip to the East Coast. They produce an authentic lobster roll with a decent amount of fresh crustacean. The flavor and style is nearly identical to the one I had underneath the Brooklyn Bridge a year ago. Due to the heat, I passed on the chowder. The combination of half shrimp, crab, and lobster is great for beginners. It is somewhat small and a bit expensive, but you are eating north Atlantic lobster in the middle of the desert people.  The small shack has no air conditioned seating and only a small unit inside, so it does get rather hot during common Vegas heat waves. The service was fast and helpful satiating my lobster fix until I return to New England.",

I thought all three were very tasty. I wasn't disappointed at all. My only issue was maybe, they were a little small or my appetite was just a little big.

    "text": "I'm gonna' give Luke's 5 stars even though it's a close call. As a million others have said the portions are rather tiny and the prices are not so tiny, so that does matter to most. I'm like a lot of others when I visit Vegas, though, and tend to just open my wallet and pay the big bucks for anything I want.  On my recent visit to Luke's on a chilly day (the day before it snowed there, actually) I decided to pop in to check it out for lunch. It's tiny with limited seating in the back. I ordered a truffle lobster sandwich and small clam chowder.  I guess I've never had a True Maine / New England style combo, because I was simply blown away by it. The bread was spongy and just a bit crunchy on the outside and slathered in butter and truffle oil. The lobster was, of course, totally fresh and on point. I couldn't believe how good it was. The chowder was definitely the best I've had anywhere, and I thought I tasted the good stuff in Boston. The size was pretty tiny though. I ended up going back and ordering another half sandwich. I could have gotten by without it (meaning I was content with the portion) but it was so good I decided I had to have it. So I was out $40+ for a tiny sando and a half, a cup (literally a small cup) of chowder and a Perrier. Was it worth it? It was really damn good so I think so but I can see how others may say it's not. The girls working there were pleasant and glad to see I liked it after I returned raving to order another half sando. I'll be back on my next Vegas trip.",

The Yelp reviews are awesome but I needed a little more justification for this pricey little snack.   I purchased the Lobster roll for $17 and it satisfied my appetite all 320 calories for a few hours but it's definitely a snack unless you order a soup.   Over ten locations including Japan and fresh traceable seafood (back to the lobsterman) was a win for me. The price is justifiable and I'd definitely return in the near future this time for the trio.   I didn't see any dessert but if I'm ever in Miami the key lime pie addition will be a must.",

    "text": "This place is AWESOME. Luke's Lobster is known for their (you guessed it) Lobster Rolls. And let me tell you, at $17 a roll, it is worth every penny.   The location is freestanding and faces the Strip, with a handful of outdoor tables in the back, if you're brave enough to withstand the Vegas heat. Otherwise, I recommend taking your roll inside for some 21st Century A/C!   Although the Lobster Roll is fantastic (and I'll get to that delight in a second,) I was a little bummed that their kettle chips weren't made in house as well. They're just your average, run-of-the-mill, store bought variety, which made me feel like I was ordering a filet mignon served with a side of frozen veggies. However, their sodas are all unique and delicious (Blueberry Lemonade, for example) and their coleslaw (which I don't usually enjoy,) is made with a tangy vinaigrette instead of mayonnaise and is quite tasty!   Now, onto the Lobster Roll! It is their #1 Seller and signature menu item. At about 5 inches long, it seems rather puny upon first glance, but once you've eaten it, you realize any more would be far too rich. Plus, the roll itself is PACKED with incredible chunks of lobster meat and seasoned with salty, garlic-y blend of  spices that I can only image possess magical properties. Then there's the bread. THE BREAD. It is perfectly coated in butter and pressed for a slight crisp and a little warmth...perfection!   Yes, the price is a bit steep, but you also have to remember Luke's motto of \"Traceable, Sustainable Seafood.\" You get what you pay for!   I also want to mention that the woman who helped me and my friend was quite knowledgeable about the history of the restaurant and its (many) global locations!   Don't forget to ask for a Stamp Card if you plan on visiting again (Buy 10 Rolls, Get 1 Free) and  dill pickles are also free upon request!",

The location is a small shack located outside of the fashion show mall. It is air conditioned on the inside with a bar like table that seats 2. They have outside seating that is shaded if your up for that.   Food wise the taste is great. You can tell the lobster is fresh, the bun is toasted to perfection. Lobster speaks for itself really. The only. thing I can critique is that the size is snack sized. If you're looking for a meal, this would be considered as a light meal. You are able to get combos that can somewhat fill you up, but otherwise I wish I could have been full on the lobster roll alone.   I would go during happy hour, as they have some deals that I hear are great. Since their prices are pretty high (I would assume so since all seafood is pretty costly), happy hour is the way to get more out of your dollar.   I am definitely not a local and won't be coming to this place often, but whenever I am in Vegas and in the area, I will definitely stop by again. 4/5",

One difference that I noticed is the Las Vegas location is literally a mini shack building with 2 small counter seating inside with a handfull of tables outside in their patio area. Granted that it has a mist system in place, it was still a bit uncomfortable in the hot Las Vegas summer.  We placed our order inside the shack and were directed to sit in the patio. One of the staff members would bring us the food when it was ready. The wait for the food was not too long. We had ordered the Luke Trio with a side of Clam Chowder (plus drink of our choice) and the Lobster Grilled Cheese. They also have water available, just make sure you ask them and they will bring you a cup.   The Chowder was a bit salty, but filled with chowder goodness. It also comes with oyster crackers. The rolls were delicious with just the right amount of butter and toasted just right; crisp but still chewy. The Grilled Cheese was just as yummy.   Overall, the rolls were just as good as what I had in Boston. I was disappointed that we didn't get to sit in the AC building, but at least we had good food.",

There is a light dusting of pepper or something on the rolls. It doesn't hinder the taste of fresh ingredients at all.  Have I mentioned lobster?

Super tiny little hut right outside of the Fashion Show Mall that you walk into and tell them your order. They're so nice and very knowledgable about sustainable seafood and where their lobsters come from! Food is fresh and flavorful. It's not overpowered by mayo or dill as many other lobster rolls can be. I would HIGHLY recommend this place to any and everyone looking for a good, quick bite to eat! Seriously, you will not be disappointed! Definitely in the top 3 places I've eaten in Vegas, hands down.",

The staff are friendly and made sure to offer suggestions to me. I had the trio which was fantastic. I dont even know which roll was better out do the three. I even ordered an extra lobster roll after I finished my trio cause the food was that good. Lobster roll even came with a free beer. If you love lobster definitely make sure you come through and show them so love. I may try to make it back again before ai leave town because it's that good.",

Luke's has a small shaded patio to eat on, seating is very limited. Menu is not very big but rest assured the menu is perfect for the size of the establishment and the freshness of the food. For the drinks there are craft sodas etc. and beer. They offer catering and the corn chowder is seasonal, regular clam chowder served all year.   By the way Luke's is right across from the Wynn, I would definitely recommend trying the trio which is crab, lobster and shrimp 1/2 rolls also the lobster grilled cheese is really good. Enjoy, I know I did..",

And let me tell you I am glad that we did make the trek to this location. Taylor was amazing, she was our cashier and SUPER personable my friend and I thought we were talking to another friend lol I also appreciate her honesty with me.   I ordered the jumbo lobster roll with clam chowder. My lobster roll had big juicy pieces I was in heaven.. The clam chowder was also tasty, my friend ordered the combo with half lobster and half crab, (both delicious)Taylor made her a blueberry Shandy to drink (I heard it was good) as hot as Vegas was all I drank was water. I don't get to Vegas too often lately but the next time I visit I will for sure come here!!!!",

The food is good but a bit pricey for what you get... however if you want lobster roll, there aren't many choices in town.   Fresh tasting lobster, crab and shrimp rolls on buttery bread with plenty of seasoned salt... delicious.   The main drawback to this place is the location and seating options.  It's set up in a permanent kiosk off LVB in front of Fashionshow.  You order inside the standing room only kiosk and if you want to eat-in, they have a small claustrophobic outdoor covered patio that's stuffed with too many chairs and tables.  It's usually too hot in the summer and too cold in the winter... for 20-30 bucks a meal, it should accommodate diners a bit better.  The food is good though.",

We ordered 2 lobster roll meals and 2 grilled lobster cheese sandwiches and the total was $76! The meals are the lobster roll, bagged chips and a soda. I know I know \"it's lobster what do you expect?\" For the sizes of the rolls and the amount of lobster that was in the grilled lobster cheese sandwiches I would have expected A LOT more. It's a very small establishment on the strip in front of The Fashion Show Mall. There were only 3 tables in their little section they have outside of the restaurant and they were all taken by 1 big family which only 2-3 people were eating from Luke's. We had to sit out of their seating area on the strip which was very dirty and there were homeless people sitting all around. I'd have to give my business elsewhere for anything lobster.",

    "text": "Where to find the best lobster roll ever? None other than the Las Vegas Strip. Yes, you read that correctly. Luke's Lobster, where have you been all my life?! Luke's started as a vision of a Maine native and lobster-man, Luke Holden. For those of you not on the East Coast, you're in for a treat because Las Vegas is the only West Coast location. If you are in the area, do not miss this little kiosk. Luke's Lobster is located near the Fashion Show Mall right by Neiman Marcus. It's very easy to miss as it is a small kiosk in between a bunch of other stores and attractions. We took an Uber ride here to avoid any parking issues and there was not much of a line at the kiosk. The guy working the register was super friendly and interactive. He knew about the product and menu and was able to explain how it all goes down. The lobster is top quality and sourced from trusted fisherman. I was ready to try this little hole in the wall and judge it myself. I ordered the one and only thing I came for, the lobster roll.  The lobster roll was delivered to our little patio table in a basket that made my eyes light up. A quarter pound of chilled wild caught lobster in a toasty split top bun with melted lemon butter, mayo, and the secret seasoning. One word, phenomenal. The warm crisp bun topped with a generous portion of buttery creamy lobster blew my taste buds, and mind, away. Talk about a few moments of bliss. That's how long it took me to wolf down this roll, just a few minutes. There is more good news. This amazing, fulfilling, delicious roll that I speak of is only 320 calories. How do they pack so much flavor in 320 calories is beyond me but I would eat it every day if I could. Priced at 17 dollars a sandwich, it is not a cheap meal but you definitely get what you pay for. Add another 5 bucks for a side (either poppy seed slaw or cape cod chips) and a beverage.   I could've probably eaten two more of these suckers but my wallet wouldn't have been happy. I decided to savor the yummy goodness and come back again another time. It was really a great experience overall. Many people prefer lobster rolls cold. Here, you get the satisfaction of the warm bun while the fresh, chilled sweet lobster sits on top. The service was fantastic from beginning to end. The guy took our order, brought it to our table, and asked how it was when we left. He was enthusiastic about the product which made me feel good about what I was eating. Luke's Lobster needs to make its way on to Los Angeles because it topped my list of lobster rolls. Simple, sweet and delicious. I can't wait to come back.",

Heather who helped us the first day was very accommodating and prepared a seasonal snow crab roll and Jonah crab roll for us. The other staff are very pleasant too. We didn't try any other items on the menu either day.  What a step up from similar options in LA like Cousin's Maine Lobster and Connie and Ted's (which is beyond subpar). The fact crab is an option over lobster is great as I prefer it.  Highly recommend this spot in Vegas for a well priced and high quality quick bite.",

For lobster in Nevada, it was surprisingly crispy and fresh tasting. That said, there was a lack of that salty lobster taste that makes those East Coast joints so spectacular. All in all, this was a great lobster place. I had the Taste of Maine which was lobster, shrimp, and crab. The crab was my favorite and I would highly recommend this place!",

Right when we arrived in LV, we went straight to Luke's Lobster and got the Lobster Roll ($18 each). Each lobster roll is about the length of an average sized hand, filled with a great amount of lobster. The lobster roll wasn't drenched in sauce, which made the flavors of the lobster more bold. I really enjoyed the bread as well since it was soft, and somewhat buttery.   I would definitely eat this everyday if I could!   FYI, these lobster rolls are cold!",

    "text": "In general not very BIG on the whole lobster roll. But talk about five star winnah! It definitely redefined my perception of lobster roll. The few times had it always overcooked, bread not very good, lack of lobster in it, overkill on the mayo or lack of seasonings, and for the price not the first thing that would peak my interest on any menu. Thankfully help of Vegas Yelpers and Suzy H heard about the new Lobster Roll player in town. One that came with lot of great vibes, solid reviews, and established restaurant on the east coast. Luke Lobster based in Maine am like really there nothing more legit then Maine lobsters right??? I kind of had high expectations but in all honesty totally nailed it.   Thankfully with Suzy H we make sure if going check out restaurant for the first time never get the same thing plus try as much of the menu as our tummy can. lol! We both got the combo that comes with choice of soup, chips, and beverage of your choice. I think its the best deal you can get. Really not sure the exact amount saved. If your going spend the money on lobster roll that not exactly cheap lunch or dinner. Why not get full meal plus the SOUP it must with any of the rolls. Perfect compliment. We ordered the clam chowder and lobster bisque. Both awesome. If there was soup nazi in Vegas. Luke Lobster hands down would go out of my way just for SOUP. Really that good for me. The clam chowder has so much depth not just creamy but hearty with clams, potatoes, and great flavor. The lobster bisque talk about nice chunks of lobster in it. Suzy first bite got nice piece and really till the very bottom find pieces in it. Tradition way more so in fancy upscale restaurants all soup or very little if any actually lobster. Again the bisque has nice depth not just creamy tomato soup but taste the lobster in it and see it. Any soup comes with crackers cause soup without crackers. The chips they have regular and salt & vinegar. The drinks that another reason get the combo. Am sure might see it in speciality stores but it was the first time had that brand that based in Maine. We tried the blueberry soda and the ginger ale. The blueberry soda was delicious. Refreshing. The ginger ale would pass on it. The blueberry soda not overpowering the blueberry flavor but still has the carbonation associate with soda. It was different but the tasty way!!!!  The star of the show the lobster roll. The bread talk about amazing!!!!!!!!!! Always preached on any review with sandwich. Sandwich really starts with the bread and not filling that will offset the bread. The bread or roll they use could eat everyday. They butter it then toast it perfect golden brown on the outside. So good. The lobster was all the things that done the right way. It had nice pieces from the claw, knuckle, and tail. Every piece was cooked to perfection. Moist, without the mayo/seasonings (no idea it is except dam tasty) amazing taste like butter, and all together perfect lobster roll. We even tried the crab roll. Another good one. It was little different because the crab is chilled so not warm like the lobster the meat. Still use the same bread. If you decide split it kind of cute cause bread just of split rolls.  The only thing that bummer. It really small place more like food stand outside of fashion show mall on the strip. Only ten seats. Really look at the positive is there better place too people watch then the Vegas strip?? Now you can do it with style and killer lobster roll. On cold nights the soups will keep you warm. No doubt if not been to Luke Lobster. Need too!!",

The lobster tail WAS a bit tough n cold but what can you expect. The lobster claws in the half sandwich was chunky and full! The crab was delicious, you could taste the grain and fibers of the meat and the mayo brings a bold flavor over it. The bay shrimp sandwich was a great starter to work up to the bigger crustaceans. Clan chowder was phenomenal; chunks of clams were everywhere!  Overalll: would go again if it didnt cost me an arm and a leg :)",

Not too heavy. We had the lobster roll and grilled cheese. The lobster was very generous on the roll and by far is the best lobster roll I've had. The grilled cheese was not as meaty but did taste really good. Definitely a stop if you like lobster.",

This is a new place (opened about 3 weeks ago), but not new to New York as it was originated there  Located at a small shop outside of the Fashion Show mall. Good break from all the shopping and gambling inside. They don't have a lot to offer, but with the few choices they have, they ensure you with the greatest quality. The three main stars: lobster, crab and shrimp. It is fresh and they have DIFFERENT ones depending on availability and taste. By that, you know you're getting the good ones. I'd imagine that trying to catch them later in the day would pose a difficulty because it might run out.  I ordered the lobster roll ($18). It was PERFECT. The bread was lightly buttered and toasted. There was hella lobster and it was seasoned just slightly to bring out the full flavor (the lobster itself was already sweet). Never in my life will I want anything less than of Luke's.   We loved it so much that we decided to buy two more for our family.... to spread the lobster joy.... :) And they loved it, too.  I was too naive to think that Lobster Me was my True love. It's time to leave and run away with Luke's.",

    "text": "This is my new number one spot for lobster rolls. For sure. Thank you for coming to Vegas!   The bread roll itself is just perfect: lightly buttery, soft, toasted crisp on the outside, subtle but not forgettable--lets the lobster shine. Or maybe it has no choice under such fresh, divine, delicate, super sweet meat that's pure and not drenched in a mask of outside flavor--just a clean wet butter coating.   Luke's is really that good. Once, when I wasn't paying attention and took an unforgivable sloppy bite, a piece of chunky lobster, as if in slow motion, fell off my roll onto the table and then onto the ground. My husband dramatically yelled, also as if in slow motion. I have never seen him like that over food. He seriously picked the lobster up off the outside mall floor and then ate it. Right in his mouth. No hesitation. I can't say I would do the same, but I can say that I might if I were at home.   Note: When they come out, they look tiny, wee wittle wolls, but fear not! It's really a lot of lobster. Appropriate and True, claws and all. I think I didn't finish a bite once.   They have crab and shrimp, too.   Look for it in Fashion Show Mall, past the food court and OUTSIDE. We will come during winter and sit out there even when the heat lamps aren't on yet, if that tells you something. Park at Neiman Marcus if you intend on being a regular and coming just for Luke's. No shame in that game.",

    "text": "My 100th review goes to Luke's Lobster! Why? Because it is the best lobster roll I've ever had!   Here goes... Luke's Lobster is located outside of Fashion Show mall in a little shack.  It's is located near Neiman Marcus so I recommend parking there for easier access.  It is outside so you will be exposed to the elements... But they do have a couple heat lamps. But let's be real... The heat lamps aren't going to save you from the cold chill.  We ordered the lobster roll and clam chowder meal which comes with chips and a drink... And it was delicious! The lobster is shipped overnight from Maine and was fresh as can be.  It is served chilled; topped with butter and a little mayo on a warm roll. It is a bit small but they certainly didn't skimp on the lobster filling. The clam chowder came out hot and had plenty of clams in it (not like other clam chowders I've had where I questioned if they even put clams in it).    Now for the price....It is expensive.  For the our 2 meals it cost $56 bucks. Seafood is generally more expensive anyways; but it was so good I'm likely to pay that price again. It's just not something you can afford to eat often.   The owner and staff were super helpful and patient; constantly checking to see how we were doing. Big ups for that!   I'll def be back for more!",

They are located right in front of Fashion show mall facing the Las Vegas Strip. Lobster, crab, and soups, I'm in!!! You can get a grilled cheese with lobster or crab, wait WHAT!!!! Tried the grilled cheese of course and it was BOMB! I chose to get mine with crab and I loved it. Had to try the Lobster roll as well along with some lobster bisque soup and I finished every bit of it!! Everything was fresh and definitely some great options to chose from! Everything was flavorful and delish. It's a tiny little spot with a few tables  not enough room for groups but, if your on the strip, at fashion show, or just hungry for some CRABS (Lol the good kind of of course) check it out! It's definitely worth it!",

Highly recommend. Also seems cheaper and better than \"Lobster Me\" (also in Vegas). Their specialty drinks are interesting. Tried the Honey Lemonade (strong honey flavor), which was OK and the blueberry soda (more preferable). Definitely go. Also great customer service.",

I went with a half roll of snow crab and a lobster roll (full size)   The half size roll was small but there was a decent portion of crab for the small roll. Snow crab was good as I expected with that almost sweat flavor.   The lobster roll was very good, again a healthy portion of meat in the roll. I could have eaten 10 of them it was so good.   The price was on par with what I'd expect to pay in Vegas (or most places) for a fresh lobster roll.   I wish the rolls were larger but that because I'm a big eater. I will stop in again in my next trip to Vegas.",

My husband and I both got the lobster roll, chips and lobster bisque. What I like about this place it that you are getting lobster and the roll and none of the extras such as celery, lettuce and all that other stuff that other places use for filler. The light butter and mayo sauce they use is not over powering,  or goopy and compliments the roll well. The seasoning they use is simple yet tasty and that is what I am looking for and also they toast the roll here perfectly. I have been a victim of getting a non toasted, cold flavorless roll at other lobster joints but Luke's Lobster gets it right. The lobster bisque was really good too. Not floury or goopy at all. It was light , flavorful and had nice lobster chunks in there. This is for sure my new lobster spot. They keep it simple with good quality and taste.",

At the time that we came here there was a table for two that we would be able to sit in. The seating arrangement is so small though that it feels a little bit uncomfortable.   The food though is pretty good. The lobster rolls seem like a mini size and we decided to try all three different types.   The thing is that I didn't actually enjoy was that the meat was cold. I don't know if this is the correct way of having a lobster roll but the other places that were in Vegas had the lobster inside warm with the bread.   Overall it was still an interesting place to try and see why so many people enjoy this spot. It does take time to get your order ready, so just wait a bit and you'll have a pretty nice time.",

    "text": "Went here for lunch and was not fond of this place. I had a delish lobster roll during my trip to Boston and I thought I should try this place out.   It's located at the Fashion Show Mall so parking is pretty easy and convenient. If you park at the underground garage, it's better to go to the Neiman Marcus side and take the stairway up to the strip. You'll see Luke's Lobster on your right once you take the stairs.   This place is pretty small, have about 4 small tables and couple chairs. Since it's an outside dining style and the fact it's right on the strip with many pedestrians from the mall and tourists around, you should expect a loud dining experience. I am curious how the dining experience would be during the summer when it's 100 degrees outside. Does not sound too appealing to me. On the positive side, the place is clean and I did appreciate the fresh flower on each table.   For lunch I tried:  - Trio Roll $20: 1/2 portion of Lobster, Shrimp and Crab roll. Supposedly, this is one of the famous dish on their menu. I thought the lobster and crab was average. It was fresh but a bit bland. I did not care about the shrimp; maybe because they were small shrimps and I am not a fan of small shrimps.   Note that their portion were super tiny. Their 1/2 sandwich roll was about 4 inches long. Pricey roll.  - Lobster Bisque $11. I really enjoyed the lobster bisque. Very tasty and you can taste the fresh lobster. The cup size was small than what I expected considering the cost.   Service was quick, attentive and efficient. We were in and out within 40 minutes and we were taking our time. Would I care to come back again? Unlikely.",

These are so delicious. And I was surprised that the meat provided was generous as well. In my experience, a lobster roll won't have as much meat stacked in the toast. I basically drank my food, it was so delicious.   The only reason I'm dinging this place one star is because of the service. It's a super small location, so it feels tight. I wish it could be a bit bigger. Next, the employees seemed super disengaged. One was casually eating at a table when we walked in. Now, I understand that the place is small and that there might not be alternative space. Thus this may be by design. But what really stood out is that when I went back to order a second lobster roll, I felt as if I had severely inconvenienced the staff. In fact, the second lobster roll I received seemed to be stacked a bit higher!! This was a plus. Although I feel like this was an attempt to fill me up and hopefully prevent me from ordering a third lobster roll!!",

All of the seafood were juicy and buttery if you're into buttery seafood. Forget about the calories,  you're in vegas! Pricing is on the high end but the quality helps match it. Even though the trio was small,  it's pretty filling because you have to get a huge bite to eat it. Not focusing too much on other element but seafood meat. :) loved it.",

It's a completely unassuming little shack with a small covered patio area that serves up some amazing seafood, especially for the price!(for the Vegas Strip, anyway)  I've made many visits, then in checking Yelp I realized I've never actually reviewed it!!!  If it's your first time, get yourself the trio (1/2 roll each of lobster, shrimp, and crab rolls) to get an idea. Over several visits I'm a fan of the crab roll. The lobster Mac and cheese isn't just tiny pieces garnished on top like some \"fast seafood\" in Vegas , it's large chunks spread through the dish. The 1/2 chilled lobster tail for $5 is a great add on if you've got a bit of an appetite. Per person, you're looking to spend about  $15-25 here, which I find a steal given the high quality seafood, unassuming atmosphere, location on the Strip, and great service. Luke's is a \"must-go\" for me every time I visit!",

The wind chapping our cheeks  and cooling off our steaming hot plates. What a memory these flavors brought back.   It's a simple menu.

Each 1/2 sandwich is about 3-4 small bites, so savor each opportunity you get! The seafoods were fresh, juicy, and delicate. They give generous amount of seafood too! The crab was my favorite because there was so much flavor, tenderness, and each bite had a pack full of crab. The bread here is so delicate yet crispy that it melted in your mouth.   Location: located outside of Fashion Show Mall, small little shop near the stairs. Outdoor seating but provides shade in the blazing heat. Wished they had indoor AC seating area.   Service: friendly and laid back! Shoutout to the guy who recommended adding sirarcha. He told me Luke loves eating his seafood rolls with sirarcha but to also try it as is.   Overall, yes you are paying quality over quantity, but this East Coast chain is amazing. I was pretty sad when I realized I had one more bite left, it was that good. Easily, this place is ranked my top 3 for crab/lobster roll places!",

I went ala carte and added a pale ale beer. Tasty brew but unfortunately can't recall the name.   The roll itself is kinda small. Enough for lunch but certainly not a dinner. The meat portion was generous for the comparative size. Good size chunks and not a lot of filler with lettuce or celery. My wife was disappointed that it didn't have more seasoning or a mayo dressing. I tried her coleslaw and it also lacked mayo. It's a vinegar based slaw. You're forewarned.",

    "text": "Not great,  The lobster rolls are very small for the price.  Cold, unseasoned. The service is very slow, although not terribly busy they can't keep up with normal traffic.  There's only room for one technician and one cashier.  I ordered a little of everything.   The shrimp is cold, small, and had a hint of chlorine in it. The crab is from a can.  Most of the customers really enjoy it but I'm from NY and Lived in LA and been vacationing in Maine.   Not saying I'm a food snob, I simply know the difference and this place is too expensive, too simple, too small of portions.     I don't recommend it unless you think places like Dennys or IHOP is 4 stars.  If you're well traveled or a True foodie,  this place is blech.",

    "text": "The lobster rolls here were teensy tiny compared to every lobster roll I've ever had (less the ones some East coast McDonald's have) but it was pretty loaded for what is was and the flavors were delicious.   There's definitely some stuff that could be worked out though...  + We ordered one lobster roll without mayo because my grandma hates it. Open it up after we'd already left to find seating a quarter mile away at the mall food court and lo and behold... mayo. It wasn't like they were busy either. We were the only customers in there.   + Inside the tiny counter shop was one very unenthusiastic guy behind the counter who took our order and the other employee who was sitting in the only chair in the tiny waiting area right in front of the fan on her laptop. The guy behind the counter was emotionless and could not have been more clear in the tone of his voice that he did not want to deal with customer that day. He did give us all the information we wanted, but then he messed up the only extra instruction in our 2-sandwich order and overall gave off an incredibly unwelcoming vibe.  + The employee sitting in the chair, who I assumed was doing something work related on her laptop, was taking up the only seat in the tiny place and plopped herself right in front of the fan. I thought that plus that she did not look up once to even pretend like she gave a f*ck there were customers there, one of which was an 80-year old woman coming in from the 120-degree day, was pretty bold. Strangers on a public bus are more customer service oriented and willing to give up their seat for a few minutes than that employee.   + The price wasn't bad but I was pretty shocked after we left and walked so far to go somewhere to eat with air conditioning and finally opened the boxes to see how small the portions were. We even added on extra lobster tails as a side (recommended) and for being advertised as a meal with an additional add on, it could hardly be considered a meal. 1 sandwich + a lobster tail is a snack at best.   Knowing what I know now, I would go back and try again if I was already walking by but I'd make sure to order myself two whole lobster rolls for myself if I wanted to feel full. But I do have to give props for serving up the best little lobster roll in the middle of the desert.",

That problem still exists for Luke's, as far as fresh seafood is concerned, but it is still a boost to what can be had in Las Vegas. Located in a kiosk outside the Forum shops on Las Vegas Blvd., It is worth a visit, especially if you live in the West and miss the fresh seafood of the East.

Nerveless I was sold at 300 cal for the lobster roll - less than a double cheeseburger! The bun was warm,  buttery, toasty and loaded with yummy lobster goodness. I ate it slowly so as to savour it. Boy was it good! Not filling though. I could've easily inhaled 3 lol.   Only reason I give a 4 star and not 5 - price.  $17 for this small ass roll - yikes. Def not something to miss but I can't afford to be a frequent flyer here at that price.",

It was smaller than you'd expect but still had plenty of seafood. The seafood was succulent and done just right. The bun was fluffy, buttery, and toasted to perfection. The crab roll and lobster roll were both good. Didn't care for the shrimp though. The order also came with 2 claws. Again, smaller than you'd expect but still good.   Service was very friendly as well. They have a small seating area which is great if the weather is nice. Saw a few crickets so may not be suitable if you're afraid of them.",

I say \"hunt\" because we managed to walk right past the small unassuming stand, and all around the front of the Fashion Mall before finding it. It needs a lobster on top of the roof! The hunt was well worthwhile, as our lobster rolls were delicious. They had lots of sweet lobster meat, and the side of coleslaw was tasty as well, and a better side than a bag of potato chips. The lobster bisque, while not as good as others I've had, had more lobster meat than any I've ever had. The service was friendly! I do wish they had a better selection of beverages, and the only seating is in the small outside patio, but I will definitely come back here when I'm in Las Vegas!",

I thought the food was good (above average) with their special spice being good as well and not overpowering the flavor of the lobster. The size of the roll itself is on the small side and in order to fill yourself up, you'd have to order 2 rolls which would be pretty costly. Overall for a small snack, I would recommend this place, but advise people of the cost.  If you plan on going there for a meal, be prepared to spend a good amount of cash to get the quantity of food you want.",

They have a combo so you can actually get all three and the sandwich is half the size of the regular roll. This place may not be a dinner per say destination but what the serve up is fresh made to order in front of you and the ingredients are top notch.   It can get a little pricey after all it's Maine lobster. But still it's a great treat when you want to indulge. They serve a cool variety of soft drinks that are brought in from Maine. Very cute place i recommended trying this I don't think you will be disappointed. They close at 9:00 p.m. Dining is outdoor so it can be chilly but the have heaters and they don't mind turning them on for you.",

I came by to get my lobster fix and stopped into this cozy little shack to pick up a lobster roll. There was only one other party in front of me and luckily there was also seating outside. I ordered a roll, chips and a drink. It came out within 5 minutes after ordering. The seating was all covered and it's outside of the little shop. It is hot on a summer day since there is not much airflow through there. The staff was nice and welcoming. The lobster roll was amazing. Buttered and soft, packed with lots of fresh lobster. It satisfied my lobster craving to say the least. I have gone to fancy restaurants to get lobster in the south, paying 3 times the price of one of these rolls and it is always a letdown. I wish we had one of these near me because I'd go all the time. If you're in the area and love lobster I highly recommend!",

I had a bottle of the recommended rootbeer with potato chips and my hubby ordered a beer. This place is legit, and you DEFINITELY need to go there! The customer service was awesome.

I ordered the sampler which came with 3 sandwich pieces (Tiny) and two crab claws a drink and chips. One of the most important things for a good lobster roll is the bread. Unfortunately it wasn't what I expected. It was tasteless not buttered or crisp. A good amount of meat but also tasteless and bland lacking freshness. In fact all three sandwiches were very bland and lacking flavor. Overall a waste of money and time. I have ate lobster rolls everywhere from Maine to Boston to san Francisco. And these were by far the worst taste and value. Not because they didn't look good but the lack of flavor and the amount of salt and pepper they put on is a way too much and seems too be trying to cover the lack of taste. Very disappointed......Plus only outdoor seating for a $30 plate of sandwich bites? Maybe it was a off day but it would take a miracle to change my mind.",

I actually was afraid that they could possibly be closed since many restaurants are closed between 3-5 PM. Thank goodness they were still open.  I ordered the lobster roll, of course, and gave my daughter a few small bites.  She actually enjoyed the bread more since there was more flavor in the bread.  The lobster itself was a little bland, but it worked well with the buttered bread.  Sadly, I can't give it a full 5 stars because I finished the whole darn thing in about two minutes.  Yes, it was my first meal so I was starving--I finished it quickly, but it still felt like a small portion for $17 dollars.  My other complaint is that I asked for ice, and they told me they don't have ice.  How can a place that serves food and drinks not have ice?  The lady recommended that I walked to Starbucks, which I was going to do any way...",

Huge chunks of fresh, sweet juicy lobster on  a buttered roll that resembles texas toast. Great!!!! I also love, and I must say again, LOVE the stone crab claws! So delicious.... Only three pieces to an order so it can get a little pricey to get full.  Location is the only reason I didn't give them 5 stars. The outside small hut located in front of the Fashion Show Mall is extremely inconvenient to park and get to for us locals. Worst is the seating 3 or 4 small tables outside in the sun...... Vegas....... 110 degrees...... and if the tables are full you have to stand and hold your food in the sun, no other seating options are even close by........",

Lobster rolls are not large, so I wouldn't recommend coming here if you're starving unless you're prepared to shell out for two rolls.  Other than that, you get a decent portion of fresh lobster complemented by butter and mayo in a toasted bun. Tasted as good as the ones I've had in the east coast. What a great addition to the plethora of dining options on the strip!  I also recommend trying out their Blueberry Lemonade. It definitely has more honey than what I was used to in the past, but still tasty.",

The crab roll was my favorite of the three. The buttery roll and light mayo made for the perfect bite. The portion was perfect for a light late afternoon lunch. It's pretty pricey for the serving but heck it's Vegas and everything has an inflated price tag. The trio, chips and soda cost $28.",

Not only do they start by getting the soft bread roll buttered and browned, the seasoned lobster is pretty much 100% wholesome without any extra fillers and the meat is balanced with great seasonings and tasted absolutely delicious. Extra warm butter is provided for customers who want to amp-up the buttery richness. It's one of the best tasting lobster rolls I have ever eaten.  I guess I have not tried a whole lot of lobster rolls in my life, particularly from the East Coast but it's great to know that I can get good lobster rolls in Las Vegas for a reasonable price - compare to the SF Bay Area.

Upon entering the small restaurant, my daughter and I were immediately greeted by a lovely and friendly sandwich artist whom discussed the sandwich options: shrimp, crab or lobster on a buttered hoagie roll. She asked if I wanted to make it into a meal by adding either coleslaw and a drink or potato chips and a drink. I chose coleslaw and a drink with a lobster sandwich. I didn't have to wait very long before my meal was ready and brought out to me. Upon sinking my teeth into the first bite--it can be described as heaven......the lobster was delicious and hearty...rich and decadent, melt in my mouth wonderful goodness. The coleslaw was tasty and delectable. It had just the right amount of seasoning--it wasn't too sweet and not to bitter. I even gave my husband some bites! I recommend this restaurant to others for a quick bite that is both satisfying and delightful.",

My husband and I went to share a roll but it was so good we had to order another. And they can give you lobster roll without mayo so cheers to that. Would have liked to try the crab and/or shrimp but our wallet can only take so much. They do let you add a small lobster tail on the side for $5 so if you can't get enough lobster than do it - you'll still want a second roll though  ;)  They had an interesting selection of sodas, including a blueberry lemonade that was actually on the tart side and not too sweet - incase you are in the mood for something different. But if you like sweet sodas they got you covered too.   We came around closing time so their back patio was closed and it was super crammed inside so there wasn't really a place to sit. There's seating around outside at various other places but it's \"supposed\" to be for customers so sit at your own risk.",

This place is quite pricey, but I believe that you get what you pay for. Definitely get the lobster roll! The crab and the shrimp rolls are not bad, but the lobster was my favorite for sure. Also, make sure you ask for a pickle on the side! Usually I'm not a big pickle person but it went really well with the roll.   Lobster: $14 Trio: $20 Large soup: $10",

    "text": "This little lobster/crab shack is located at the north end of the strip, next to the Fashion Show mall. Saw all of the great reviews on Yelp and even though we were staying in the MGM Grand, we walked all the way down to try it out. I clicked on the restaurant link in Yelp, which took me to  Luke's website, where I placed and paid for my online food order. TLDR: Highly overrated & inconvenient location. Both service & food fell short; better off finding another place to eat on the strip for the same cost.   SERVICE: Just an FYI, when you order online, it says that you must arrive within a certain timeframe or ELSE you will have to wait for the food to be remade. Sooo... we hurried over BUT had to wait for the food to be made anyway. When I told the cashier that I was picking up an online order, he gave me a WTF facial expression - in that they had not received any orders. He further questioned what I used to order: I told him the Yelp link took me to Luke's website where I also paid for the order. He further proceeded to act like NOONE EVER has ordered online, paid, and picked up food, which ultimately made me feel like a fool for doing so. I can understand if someone is new on-the-job and is unsure, but why not just ask someone off the bat immediately if you didn't know? Finally, another person came over, did some tapping on the screen and was able to pull it up; the issue according to her -- was that it takes some time for the order to come through on their end. So great, ordering ahead failed because it allegedly took time for the order to go through, unknowledgeable customer service did not help, and well, ehm...... the food.  FOOD:  Luke's Trio: $20. Basically a sampler of the lobster, crab, and shrimp rolls. For each type, you get HALF of a roll, which is 3 full inches (LOL)! The photos are highly deceptive, looking back I wish I would have taken a picture of one of the rolls next to a dollar bill for size comparison. But I'm not usually one to complain about quantity, I prefer quality over large portions. However... the taste of the actual meat with the roll was underwhelmingly bland. It really needed some salt & black pepper, a splash of lime, and a drizzle of garlic herb butter. The food was not as amazing as some of the Yelp reviews claim it to be. Did I mention the cost? At this price, the setting should be a full-blown restaurant because let's be honest, for the same cost - I could order an actual entree at a sit-in restaurant and have an overall better dining experience. Not some cramped up shack with a small outdoor seating area that has mist fans blowing into your food as you eat. This keeps their overhead and business costs low while charging premium prices for 'average' meals, which is just not worth it to the consumer unless the food can deliver (which it does not). It was at this moment I knew... I F'd up, haha. But seriously, not a food destination and won't be going back. Thank you, next.",

Compare to Utah's lobster roll, it is just about the same. The regular size is the same size as Utah's.The bread is buttery and crispy outside. The lobster is very fresh but less herb seasoning. Compare to their ads photo, there are herb seasoning on the lobster. But the ones we got didn't have any. Overall, it was still delicious. But I just wish for some herb seasoning.",

My husband checked out Yelp for some ideas on local spots and didn't tell me that he found this gem. We don't eat meat and Vegas is a steak/potatoes/casino kind of place. Not to say that there's no seafood here but the folks hanging in casinos need tons of energy that comes from cows...I digress.   So our Lyft driver drops us off in the driveway at the end of a shopping center and I got a glimpse of Luke's as we passed it since it's illegal to drop people off in the street. It's the cutest little place! It's very small and when you walk in, it smells like they invested in a lobster vent. It smelled incredible. As small as it is, Luke's has plenty of options. We went with the trio: 3 rolls of shrimp, lobster & crab; a separate lobster roll and 2 small lobster tails.   The trio rolls were smaller than I'd have liked but the flavors were all there. It was really, really good.",

My husband has the trio and a cup of corn and lobster chowder. You walk up to the counter and order and they bring it to you if there is enough seating. It was fresh and served fast. Most importantly, it was delicious. It was around $55 for both of us but the food did not disappoint. Make this stop for a one of a kind experience.",

It was raining, so we had to eat inside. The inside is literally as small as a shack. Do not come here thinking you're going to have a comfortable sit down experience. You have the choice of stool #1 or stool #2 unless the weather is in your favor, then you can sit outside.   I'm giving three stars because the lobster roll was good (just not what I expected). We were still hungry when we left.",

    "text": "As someone who lives in the city and works on the strip, it takes an enticing menu for me to dine on Las Vegas Boulevard. We initially encountered Luke's Lobster during a visit to New York City and was ecstastic to give it a try upon returning home. It's a small stand alone kiosk-like restaurant on the exterior of the Fashion Show Mall. There are two bar stools inside and about four to six mini tables in the small, private connected patio.   Upon walking in, we were immediately greeted by two friendly servers. They were knowledge about the menu item and appeared happy to help! The food was fast to come out (less than five minutes) and the system seemed efficient.   The food wasn't bad but it wasn't as good as I expected it to be either. We ordered the lobster grilled cheese an Luke's favorite (lobster roll with cole slaw and potato chips). The grilled cheese was fresh and contained lobster but it was small and mainly crust. On the other hand, the lobster roll was stacked with lobster but nothing about the flavor made a lasting impression. Unfortunately the lobster mac & cheese is a seasonal item and was not available.   For being on the strip, the price is fair ($13 for the grilled cheese and about $20 for Luke's favorite). It's cheaper than seafood anywhere else but it's more like a snack. I wouldn't recommend coming here for a full meal but a quick stop for a break between shopping or visiting tourist attractions.",

Very tasty, reasonably priced. Basically the central item on the menu. * Lobster grilled cheese. Enough lobster to earn its name, and the flavors work well together.   The items I sort of recommend: * Crab roll. It was ok. * Shrimp roll. Also, basically ok. Definitely not what you'd go there to get though. It is cheaper, though.  Things I do not recommend: * Lobster corn chowder. Didn't have much lobster in it. Flavor was solid, but I wish there was a bit more lobster in there. * Half lobster tail. I wasn't wild about it, I found the texture to be too chewy.  Still four stars because you can get good lobster at a decent price. Also, customer service has been very good each time I've been there.",

    "text": "One word: YUM!  We looked up lobster rolls on the strip that was NOT Lobster ME in the mall next to Planet Hollywood and came across Luke's Lobster outside of Fashion Show mall. We took an Lyft there and from a car, this place is easily overlooked. It is also very small. Like everyone said, it holds 6 people max and it has a small outside patio with may 6-7 tables and chairs. The two girls working were very sweet and patient while we went back and forth over what we wanted.   Since it was our first time, we went for the trio with is 1/2 of all three rolls they offer: lobster, crab and shrimp. We also tried the lobster corn chowder and I added half of a lobster tail to my order for only $5. With a bottled root beer, our total was $66. For the portions, I would have liked it to be a tad cheaper. Since they are 1/2 the size, you can finish the whole thing in 6-8 bites.   Everything was VERY GOOD. Although they could have been seasoned a little better, I enjoyed the lobster most, then shrimp, then the crab. One thing that stands out about their rolls is how much meat the put inside. They don't do like most places where it's a small loaf of bread with a tiny slit in the middle and the lobster pretty much on top. They REALLY packed their rolls with meat! And they used very big pieces of lobster!  I most definitely will be returning the next time I'm in Vegas!",

No place to eat inside but enjoying the bar, eating tender rolls while in the shadow of the Wynn is great.",

The 1st visit I got the Lobster roll combo and the 2nd visit I decided to go big or go home so I got the jumbo roll with a free lobster tail!!!!

Wife and I split the trio which consists of three half rolls; half lobster, half crab and half shrimp. I will say the shrimp was my least favorite of the three but was fantastic nevertheless. Shrimp has a light butter taste with lemon to cut the richness, crab roll was similar, stuffed with fresh snow crab lightly dressed in butter and lemon and the lobster was huge chunks balanced with butter and lemon. We added the chips and coleslaw and added half lobster tail for $5.00. Luke's Lobster is a chain so if you come across them stop by and get a roll. You'll be happy you did",

However before you decide not to eat here because it's Vegas and it's too hot to be outside I recommend you check this place out.   It's just a small hut with about 4 tables. Since we wanted to try everything we had the Taste of Main which was 1/2 lobster roll, 1/2 crab roll, 1/2 shrimp roll, 2 crab claws, pickle, chips and a drink.  Bread was perfectly toasted with a golden brown buttery crust, seafood was chilled, fresh and just so good.   Now the size of the rolls are probably a little more like a 1/3 than 1/2 but they are pretty generous with the amount of seafood in the toast.  If you are really hungry plan on spending some $ or come here for an awesome snack.",

I later overheard the other employee telling the order taker she rang it up wrong, but they didn't bother to mention it to me, or reimburse some change.  Now came the wait... there was only one order ahead of me, but it took about 15 minutes for my lunch to come out. I then had to ask for a fork for the slaw, never came, so I walked in and asked and they seemed that I did.  Maybe it was an off day, a way off day. Fortunately the food is good enough that I will return.",

The storefront is a tiny hut right in front of Neiman Marcus (at the Fashion Show), only 5-6 people can fit inside to order at the cash register, but they have seating outside (with misters) with at least 5-6 tables. We ordered: 1) $17 for lobster roll = you can finish it in 3-4 large bites; wasnt too filling, but the flavors were great and refreshing. I definitely would have liked a large portion size, but then they would have hiked up the price. :) 2) $9 for large clam chowder = delicious; packed with real clams and wasn't super thick as if it was all butter. thank goodness! wish the large size was bigger, haha 3) $20 for Luke's favorite = lobster roll, chips, coleslaw = husband said he would have just gotten the lobster roll next time instead of getting a bag of chips + slaw. paying extra $3 for slaw + chips wasn't worth it. Lobster roll was spot on though!  Friendly staff, he let us taste test the clam chowder before we buy. We were the first ones there on a Saturday morning, and it was super hot outside but good thing their misters were on. Can't go wrong with this place! Free parking in the Fashion Show mall parking lot downstairs.",

My child's lifetime name is worth it. Let that say something.   Before you hunt through the entire fashion show mall to meticulously trying to locate this place, it's outdoors. On the strip facing side of the mall. I was intimidated by the price of a $17 lobster roll but that quickly went away. These are not a stingy bunch. They literally STACK your roll full of lobster. Like how Philly Cheesesteaks are made (in Philly). The flavor of their roll itself I'm confident will haunt your dreams it's so delicious.  Please, please, please go!

The lobster was so fresh and juicy and the buns were toasted but soft and buttery it melted in your mouth.   The lobster roll was about $17 and the crab was $14. For the price, I felt the rolls were a little small...I guess portions are usually bigger in Texas? But, I would definitely come back for more. They did have a large helping of lobster busting out of the roll. Kicking myself for not getting the trio. Shrimp, crab and lobster for a little over  $20. There's always tomorrow!   There is absolutely no place to sit inside, so if you're not getting it to-go, be prepared to sit outside. They do have a covered patio with a mister but it was still hot outside. Try the blueberry honey lemonade. If you're used to overly processed high fructose drinks, you probably won't like it. It was very raw and simple and tasted like it had no fake sweetener in it, just REAL honey.",

But, you'd be missing out if you shun it just because of its location.  Rolls are simple.  Fresh, soft, somewhat dry (a good thing), mayo, butter, well cooked, juicy seafood, and a hit of spices similar to Old Bay.  That's it.  Lobster, lump crab, or shrimp.  Not very large, 7\" rolls.  All overstuffed.  If I had to guess, about 1/4lb of seafood in each.  Balanced, not over the top.  The lobster itself, plump, juicy, sweet, tender that only a cold water Maine lobster delivers.  Each roll has a softer claw and generous portions of tail meat.  If you're lucky, a knuckle.    Wonderfully creamy lobster bisque (a shot of bourbon would make this incredible), excellent New England chowder.  Lots of tender clams and clam flavor.  Finally, don't pass on the seasonal lobster grilled cheese.  OK, so a $13 grilled cheese sounds ridiculous but, buttery toasted white bread, chunks of lobster enrobed in melting, pull apart, gooey Gruyere.  The crab grilled cheese not far behind.  Think of your favorite crab dip turned personal sandwich.  Seriously good on a cool fall day.  Note:  The shack has only a few tables so you may have to take it to go.  Plenty of stairs and walls around.  Prices in line (about $0.50 more than their Maine location).  Well worth venturing outside if shopping the holiday season.",

    "text": "I love a good lobster roll with a side of Benadryl. I was excited when I first heard a buzz about a new place that serves lobster rolls opening up, Luke's Lobster.   The food is tasty and comes out pretty quick. The menu is simple. They have shrimp, crab, lobster, clam chowder, lobster bisque, original potato chips, and salt and vinegar chips.   Lobster Bisque: Chunky pieces of lobster. The bisque is creamy and delicious. 4/5  Lobster Roll: Pretty generous portions of cold lobster on a buttery roll. 4/5  Price is standard for lobster rolls. The only thing is since this is located in an open space outside Fashion Show Mall, you're subject to extreme Vegas temperatures: cold winter nights and hot summer days. We froze the night we went.",

Depending on the size of the crowd before you, they may not be able to accommodate you right away and had to wait at least 15 min in order for them to get orders out.   Decided to come back the next day....i was starvin Marvin! Had the Luke's favorite and it comes with a side of slaw,chips and lobster roll.  The bun had a hint of butter and was just perfect to not overpower the chunky Maine lobster piled on top.  You gotta stop here if youre a lobster lover.....",

Clam chowda bowl was filled to the brim (thanks!) and had lots of pieces of clam in it, big enough to taste (with an unlimited supply of oyster crackers). Was a great meal...probably my favorite, but I shared it with my husband since Lobster Rolls are so expensive, so I left semi sad, wanting more. :)  Five stars for the taste, but I wish it would be a bit cheaper (or larger).",

First time I had it was in the Luke's Lobster in NY and I tried getting it at restaurants and at Disneyland and none of them can compare to the lobster rolls at Luke's Lobster!",

    "text": "I use lobster rolls as a quick once in a while pick me up and today I decided to try something new! Luke's was absolutely amazing. The roll wasn't too buttery and I usually like a warm roll but THIS WAS AMAZING! The food was fresh and they put on the board exactly where they get each lobster, crab, and shrimp from. Great price, great deals, great service. I was super impressed and can't wait til I'm craving a lobster quick fix again!",

    "text": "We tried this place because of the raving reviews.   We ordered two lobster rolls, two crab legs, and two lobster tails for two of us and ended up spending $60, only to be still hungry after. That tells you how small their portions are   The lobster roll's bread was covered with so much butter that we could not taste the lobster at all. We had to pick the lobster out and eat it separately to taste anything.   Furthermore, the crab legs were tiny and the lobster tails were flavorless, not to mention all of the food was cold.   Don't be a fool like us and avoid this place.",

    "text": "Going to college in Boston, I've had my share of lobstah rolls. Spending time in Maine, I've had some of the best lobstah rolls ever. I keep hoping to find something of that level outside of those parts but I don't think it will ever happen. Luke's is a good attempt. It is a stand located outside of The Fashion Show Mall. It's cute and reminds me of all the lobster shack stands I've been to in Maine. They use the split top roll which is key to keeping it authentic. There were nice chunks of lobster meat in this little roll. I really enjoyed the temperature contrast of the cold lobster meat atop the warmed, buttered roll. The seasoning that was sprinkled on top enhanced the flavor of the lobster nicely. The reason I only gave it 3 stars is the size. It was so small! 3-4 bites and you are done! For $17, I wanted to savor my entire experience but it was over so quickly. I was seriously tempted to drop another $17 on another one. Luke's has a pretty darn good LR, I just wish it was a little bit bigger. SInce I won't be getting out to Boston or Maine any time soon, at least I found a spot in Vegas to go to when a lobstah roll craving hits. Get a punch card so you can earn you free lobstah roll! And get that pickle when they offer it to you- that was the best pickle I've had in a long time!",

    "text": "$18 for a sandwich?  Ok, its Vegas, and its fresh Maine lobster and holy cow that's one damn good roll.   I randomly went there the first day of my Vegas trip for lunch because we were staying at the Wynn across the street and couldnt wait to go back the next day.   Simple sandwich with a lot of lobster meat.  Yeah, only a few tables outside in the heat but that didnt bother me all that much.  I wonder if they would deliver to Texas. :)",
