Don't get me wrong, all of the sushi chefs are awesome - but most of the experience is lost if you don't sit at the bar. I usually order whatever Sonny recommends along with the typical generic sushi choices. Sometimes though, I like giving him crap by ordering only things from the kitchen when sitting at the sushi bar. I like the rice.",

Why do I want to watch football while eating sushi and sake.  - One thing I have heard good about this place is that it is open late. Until 2-3 ish, when all the famous people come over.  - I'd come here again, but I'll say this is the 3rd time..give me the \"3rd\" time omakase. It seems they have a set menu for the omakase dependant on how many times you have beeb, which i did not like... i thought it was suppose to be more of an improv attitude based on what was fresh that day.",

    "text": "My husband and I recently moved to Las Vegas/Summerlin area from Los Angeles and are in search of a really good sushi joint, similar to our all time hands down favorite (\"Sushi Nishiya\" Glendale, CA) <a href=\"http://www.yelp.com/biz/sushi-nishi-ya-glendale\">yelp.com/biz/sushi-nishi...</a>   So we tried this place, we sat at the Sushi Bar and like other yelpers service was just ok. We had asked for the freshest fish of the day and were promptly advised which ROLLS to try. Which I promptly gave our standard reply of No, Thank You. We only like Sashimi, what is your freshest fish of the day? Which again perplexes the Sushi Chef, luckily the chef working the other side of the bar jumped in and advised us to try the Halibut.   Once the issue of no rolls only sashimi was worked out I was referred to an area on the menu where they had Sashimi plates (about 8 total) which fit our needs. To say the food was spectacular would be a stretch, it seemed fresh enough but the difficulty in ordering was quite annoying and for the prices the sashimi plates were lacking.   All in all, ok Sushi joint but yes overrated. For about the same money we could go back to Hachi at Red Rock <a href=\"http://www.yelp.com/biz/hachi-las-vegas\">yelp.com/biz/hachi-las-v...</a> , which really had a nice spin Sashimi and that trendy vibe you sometimes are willing to pay extra for.   But so far for our weekly sushi fix, we are really liking Wayne's Sushi Bar <a href=\"http://www.yelp.com/biz/waynes-sushi-bar-las-vegas\">yelp.com/biz/waynes-sush...</a>  He's funny to hang with and he has quite a few dishes that are phenomenal, and we didn't even have to order. I asked him for the freshest fish of the day and he offered to just \"feed us Omakase style\" which was music to our ears!!!",

Nothing too crazy I'm sure.  While the price was fairly high, I find that most good sushi isn't inexpensive.  I've had rolls at about six places in town and this is certainly in my top two.",

If you ask, he will likely do servings of \"traditional vs original\" pieces of nigiri.  They also have a number of great sake options.

Many of you won't probably notice but for us, from Japan, we can tasted the difference, especially the sushi rice.  Still, I couldn't spend too much money knowing how much I eat, I needed to find a place that is reasonable.  Sen of Sushi's website was one of the few websites that had prices on their menu.  Their nigiri prices were about the average so I've decided to try.  It was a bit of drive from the Strip but it was easy to find.  Place was smaller than I expected and I sat down in front of the head chef for the day (not the owner/chef).  They did not have two items that I was hoping to get, ankimo and sea urchin.  But they had Kumamoto Oysters which were good.  Overall, the fish was very fresh and everything was good.  The chef suggested some of their fish of the season but most of them were white fish which I really don't care for.  Many special nigiri he recommended were seasoned with ponzu.  They were not bad but I prefer more oily fatty taste so that was a bit of disappointment but that's just my personal taste preference, nothing was wrong at all.    I've ordered one large sake, miso soup and their chocolate cake dessert and the tab came about $60.  It was a bit cheaper than I expected.  I would like to try other places in Vegas, but this place was very good.  I will definitely go back.",

However, we did have a tough time getting back to the strip because it took forever for a taxi to come and pick us up. I recommend going here only if you have your own car (or rental) or ordering a cab way in advance.  The fish was very fresh and we especially enjoyed the black snapper. The service was right on.

About 10 minutes after I came in a nice, young sat down at the bar next to me.  I don't think they expected the prices to be as high as they are at Sen so they proceeded to order almost nothing and wasted the chef's time with all sorts of requests for extra sauce here and this and that.  I couldn't keep it straight.  The chef responded by being totally rude to them.  Stuff like \"I thought you were gonna order more\" and answering questions with one word and walking away shaking his head.  They eventually made up a reason to return one of the rolls (The crab in the california roll wasn't cold.  It was room temperature?  Where are we?  The Safeway sushi aisle?)  In any case, on to the food.  Really excellent quality meal.  I loved every moment of it.  Let's get to it.  Cod lettuce wrap - one of the best things I've had.  Cod was super tender and flavorful which contrasted nicely with the crisp lettuce.  Super flavorful and delicious. Japanese pork - don't think this was pork belly even though it was as tender as belly.  Believe it's a braised piece of the shoulder.  In any case, all the parts of the pork were super tender and melted in your mouth.  Served with a wonderful sauce.  It was pricey but I could eat like 10 of those. Snapper nigiri - very nice. Japanese lasagna - I probably should have skipped this as it's more of an American type roll.  It was good....but compared to the really clean flavors of the other dishes it tasted too unbalanced and rich.  Forgot what was on it since the cream cheese overwhelmed the roll.  They kind of warned me against it in a very subtle way but I must have missed it. Salmon carpaccio - raw pieces of delicious salmon topped with a heated sauce that slightly cooks the salmon.  The salmon flavor was wonderful and it had enough fattiness to make the dish really come alive.  Highly recommended.  Thing about this place I love is the fatty dishes have enough acid in the sauce or preparation to cut through the rich taste so it evolves into something even better.  The pork was fairly fatty but the sauce was so perfect with it that you didn't feel gross eating the pork.  Love this place and their \"reverse happy hour\" and will definitely return.  Grouchy Chef - cheer up dude.  Seriously, the guy is hilarious but God knows how many customers this guy is costing them with his behavior.",

I got the $55 omakase so I could experience a selection of Japanese food and not order a roll or two and be stuffed.  My omakase is just as others have described.  Course 1 - yellowtail with garlic and peppers.  Course 2 - Mizuna salad with tuna, salmon, a wonderful dressing and some capers for added flavor.  Course 3 - Black cod with a soy miso glaze.  The fish was very flaky and delicious.  Course 4 - filet mignon done medium rare.  I would have liked rarer but it was very good.  Course 5 - Assorted nigiri and a bowl of steaming hot clam soup.  The nigiri was quite good and the clam soup was excellent! Course 6 - I had a choice and I took the chocolate souffle with a scoop of green tea ice cream with a mint sprig.  I enjoyed the meal and I left not having a stuffed feeling of having eaten too much.  I was going to get the more expensive omakase, but my server steered me away from that because some of the ingredients--lobster and foie gras--were not available.  That was an honesty I like.    I would have rated this dinner 3.5 stars, but I rounded it to 4 based on the great servers who were most gracious, attentive, and pleasant.",

Contains 3 raw fish types with vinegars and micro greens married to create something beyond taste bud heaven. I literally CRAVE the dish. Veggie tempura never disappoints, garlic edamame is delicious and the crispy tuna.... Just forget about it. DELICIOUS. #18 Roll with mango and balsamic is a MUST, who would have thought that vinegar on sushi would work?! It works. Kudos to the Chef, his passion shows through his food. Definitely 5 stars.",

Nothing has blown my socks off or stood out as being really memorable.  I hated the garlic chip that ruined my yellowtail sashimi.  I won't be back because there are many places that I enjoy much more for sushi.  If you are expecting anything like Nobu you will be very disappointed.  I only gave it a second chance because my friend said it's her favorite place.  I am not a fan of this over priced mediocre sushi place.",

He made several delicious recommendations, all beautifully prepared and presented. The special \"sauces\" served with the sashimi and nigiri subtly enhance the flavor of the fish without overpowering it. The yuzu-based sauces were especially memorable. Our waiter couldn't have been nicer and recommended several signatures dishes, including the black cod lettuce wraps, which are seriously addictive.

    "text": "I am going to focus on the desserts for this review. Much good has already been said about the food. The desserts at Sen are made to order in house, and are to die for.  Sen is open late. Even if you eat elsewhere, you can come here for dessert. You will not be disappointed.  Almond Yuzu Frangipane Tart 5/5 Luscious, soft, crispy, molten, delicious. Words fail me when trying to describe this. It's incredible. It takes everything I have not to ooh and ahhh like a baby every time I eat this. It's more like an upside down souffle than a tart. The \"crust\" outside is perfectly crisp, the inside is molten almond lava. On the side is a scoop of fresh pineapple sorbet, eat them together and you get a crazy mix of hot, cold, crispy and gooey textures, sweet, nutty, and zesty flavors. It's complex but it really works. If you like almond flavor in the least, get this.  Chocolate Souffle with Green Tea Ice Cream 5/5 Like any good souffle, this is made to order and served hot, fresh out of the oven. A souffle is difficult to perfect, not just the recipe but it has to be baked for just the right amount of time. They get it right on the money every time here. The outer layer is crisp, the chocolate center is molten and gooey. The chocolate is rich and the flavors go very well with the green tea ice cream, bitter, earthy and sweet.  You really have to give this place some credit for making these desserts to order, and even making the sorbet and ice cream in house. These desserts take longer to get to your table than premade desserts, count on waiting 10-15 minutes for them to come out after you order. If you are in a hurry, put the dessert order in before you are finished with your food. It's worth it!",

We arrived around 11 pm and there were only a couple tables still eating. We only ordered off the late night happy hour menu. All the sushi rolls and nigiri were very tasty. The beer was nice and cold and the service was very attentive. The quality of the fish was as good as I've seen so far in Vegas. I recommend the volcano roll and the cod wrapped with butter lettuce. The tempura rolls are also very good. Late night happy hour starts at 10:30 pm",

It is owned buy Sushi Chefs from a fancy place on the strip, they left and created their own.  And oh my they did it right.  The decor is spot on the staff is so incredibly nice, and they almost stand behind you (it seams) to gather your plates.  We like to sit at the sushi bar, so we can talk to the chefs and get the best ideas from them.  They recognize you after a few times and always treat you right weather you are old or new.    The fish.  This is not a AYCE.  The cuts of fish are worth the price they are always amazing, my mouth waters as I speak.  If you sit at the bar they will guide you, tell you what is fresh and what is best.  I recommend listening to them and also ordering off the special menu.  It has the most amazing flavor combinations in the world.  I also never NEVER even use a soy sauce, ever since I have been coming.  Most of the Chefs guidance will guide you to the best fish and cuts and styles.  That is why you never need soy sauce, why ruin perfection.  I Japan it is actually disrespectful to use a soy sauce on anything you make.  It is considered a art and a highly respected art.",

    "text": "After much debate, and lots of help from great Las Vegas Yelpers, we decided to dine at Sen of Japan last night.  This was my second visit, so I thought it was best to dine with the Omakase menu.  John was our waiter, ask for him when you go.  He is knowledgable and just a genuinely nice person.  The national championship game was on the tv behind the bar, so I had everything I needed for a great meal.  We opted for the $85 Omakase, which was 7 courses:  Kanpachi sashimi with Oysters -   Like Butta!  Smooth and succulent, the kanpachi was served with a dash of ponzu, fried garlic chip, and micro greens.  The oyster was served with a garlic slaw of sorts.  The oyster was flavorful and light, and a great way to start the meal.  Sashimi Salad w/ spinach and micro greens -   Tender and delicious cuts of salmon, tuna, and red snapper nestled around a bed of spinach and micro greens with a light vinaigrette.   This dish was fine, but forgettable.  The sashimi was cut very small, which affected the presentation a little bit, but the flavors and quality still shined through.  Fried Fish Eggroll -   This wasn't an egg roll at all, but I am lost for words to name it.  This was various fish, not sure what wrapped in a shiso leaf and fried topped with tobiko.  A little dry and my least favorite bite of the night, but it was very creative.  Baked Black Cod in a soy sauce topped with foie gras and a shiso pepper -   Best dish all night.  The cod was perfectly cooked to retain some moisture and finished in a light soy sauce.  The foie on top made the fish even more decedant.  The chef nailed this one, it was an evolution of flavors with each bite, and I wanted more.  Filet in mustard ginger sauce -  Cooked closer to medium than medium rare, this dish was executed well.  Nice amounts of salt and the right amount of mustard, let the beef shine through instead of other flavors.    Various nigiri -  Tuna, Salmon, Kanpachi, Ebi, Snapper.  All delicious and perfect.  I didn't even use soy sauce with these, it just felt wrong since the fish was of such high integrity.  Dessert - Chocolate souflee with homemade green tea ice cream -  Great soufle, the chocolate oozed out as my fork pierced the fluffy cake.  The green tea ice cream was made with matcha and complimented the bitterweet chocolate in the soufle wonderfully.  I was so full at this point two bites was all I could handle.  Sen of Japan is close to being perfect.  It provides great individualized service, superior quality product, and creative execution.",

    "text": "Who would have thought that a decent sushi place could exist in the 'burbs of Vegas.  I've been resisting this place ever since I met my fiance two and a half years ago, but I finally gave in this weekend.  I was pleasantly surprised by the entire experience.  We went in asking for omakase and there was a $55 option vs. $85 option.  I think the overall gist of it was that the more expensive option had the more expensive meats/fishes.  In our conversation with our server, what impressed me what they do cater to your tastes depending on if this is your first time versus fifth time there.  We decided the $55 Omakase and planned to order a la carte if we were still hungry. 1.  Jalapeno Yellowtail with olive oil ponzu sauce - Ponzu sauce can make a lot of things taste good and this is one of them.  Tangy, spicy with jalapeno.  2.  Sashimi salad with various basic cuts of fish - no wow factor but the salad dressing was good 3.  Beef Filet - just a tad overcooked but nice concept 4.  Nigiri Sushi (yellowtail, tuna, salmon, shrimp, tuna roll) - not super fresh but not bad either. 5.  Miso soup with clam - very bland soup  A la carte 1.  Uni - very fresh.. mmm butter of the sea 2.  Oh toro - not the freshest but still good  Conclusion:  Fish shipments are on Tuesday, Thursday and Saturday, hence our fishes not being the freshest on our visit Monday. My overall experience was good, and I think Sen of Japan has some potential for becoming my dedicated omakase joint.  3.75 stars for now.  I'll hopefully upgrade with subsequent visits. =)",

    "text": "Wonderful nigiri and sashimi, very interesting (in a good way!) sushi rolls.  I hated doing the \"vendor dinner\" thing for work, until I started bringing them to Sen. Now all my vendors ask to go there. These guys are from San Antonio, Denver, New York, Boston and LA. All cities with great food, and they all love Sen of Japan. I've never had a dish at Sen I didn't like, and most I absolutely love.  Not a huge Saki fan, but I did discover one that I love. It's a sparkling Saki. A lower alcohol treat that goes really well with the Hawaiian Edamame and spicy sushis.  During the \"family dinner hour\" it can be tough to get a table right away if there is more than 4 of you, but make a reservation even a couple hours early and you'll get in.  Also helps to have a little patience, and fun company, if you do like I do and ask them to bring \"whatever the sushi chef feels like creating\". It's a blast and a super fun way to try all kinds of fun food concoctions.  It's not a cheap meal, but far less expensive (and better!) than the schmancy places on the strip. Enjoy!",

    "text": "I used to go to Sen of Japan all the time when it first opened, but hadn't been in quite some time because it isn't very close to my house and it's only open for dinner. I've recently been twice, however, and am happy to report the food is as good as ever.  Both times I had the Black Cod Soy, because going to Sen of Japan and not getting the Black Cod Soy is like going to Italy and not getting pasta. It's a buttery piece of fish with a caramelized, but not overpowering, sweet exterior. Each bite melts in your mouth it may be the best piece of fish you've ever tasted. The pickled shoot that adorns it is also fantastic and offers a complementary acidic element ($13.75, add $9 to top it with fois gras).  Besides the cod, I sampled a few other old favorites, the home-made Japanese Pickles and the Mushroom Salad. The pickles are made from yamagobo (similar to a carrot), turnip, Japanese yam, cabbage, and something reminiscent of a caper berry. Each piece has a slightly different flavor and texture, but all offer a colorful, crunchy start to the meal ($8.50). The mushroom salad consists of a warm mound of gently sauteed mushrooms, including enoki and wood ear. It has a heavy dose of yuzu that makes it taste bright, and a bit tart ($7.75).  The sashimi is of the caliber of Raku, but here you can have rice with your fish at the full service sushi bar. The spicy yellowtail hand roll ($4.80) is bursting with flavor and filling, but a new favorite is the Sashimi Combination Salad with Garlic Vinaigrette ($12.95). Impecably fresh slices of normally mundane varieties, including tuna and salmon, are arranged around a pile of delicate Japanese greens topped with finely shredded radish. A light dose of garlic vinaigrette and sprinkling of capers complete the masterpiece.  Another surprise favorite was the fried calamari with onion (around $9). Tender strips of squid are paired with onion slices then beer battered and toped with slices of jalapeno. These taste like onion rings of the upscale variety.  The sukiyki was the only thing I wouldn't order again, but that's probably because I'm partial to preparing my own sukiyaki at Swish (review to come later). Overall, however, Sen of Japan is a place you should try at least once, even if it might be a little inconvenient to get to.",

My first Sen experience was beyond godly and I was treated to the freshest sushi with an interesting mix of flavors that made my mouth, stomach, eyes, and unmentionables extremely happy. At one point I think I even hid my excitement with a napkin to avoid creepy stares. Whoever thought to experiment with kiwi, mango, and other exotic fruits along with sushi should be given a Nobel Peace Prize(yes, it's that important)  Sadly, my second visit wasn't as good even though the food was just as delicious. We ended up going for the late night happy hour and when we arrived we were the only people there. We tried a shrimp tempura and orange appetizer along with the delicious black cod lettuce wraps which were off the charts tasty. The only problem with our dining experience was the fact that one of my rolls basically took 30+ minutes and I was given no explanation and our waitress didn't even offer any compensation for a 30 minute wait. I really wanted to give my first experience 5+ stars and my 2nd experience 3 stars so I guess 4 is where I'm at.",

The restaurant itself is in a shopping center so it doesn't seem all that but it SO IS ALL THAT! Our server was also very kind, attentive and efficient.    Started off with some edamame, I really like their edamame because they season it so well to make it so tasty.  Here's a break down of what we ordered: -Filet mignon tataki: SO GOOOOOD. I saw pictures of this dish and knew it would be gooooood. And I was right. For raw meat lovers- this is a must. Tender and a generous helping. -Salmon Carpaccio: Pretty good, the seasoning was a bit much so I scraped it off. Still good! -Philadelphia roll: According to my friend, she could have had 2 orders of this dish! Must have been great! -Cajun Albacore with Garlic Ponzu: I had to honor of having this fantastic dish! AMAZING AND A MUST TRY. The mushrooms and the garlic ponzu greatly compliment the seared albacore. So sooooooo amazing.  And for dessert we had the chocolate souffle of course, with the green tea ice cream. I was a bit puzzled about the combination but found it to be quite tasty!! Souffle was not bad at all.  I would give it a 7/10.    The bill came out to be around 70$ total. Which isn't bad at all considering the quality of the food!! I would DEFINITELY recommend coming here if you're in the area... definitely going to come back too!",

Go for the apps on the HH for sure like the rock shrimp and the few nigiri like the snapper are the standouts. When I gave the 4 stars then it was very fair, but not a place I was rushing to return. Fast forward coming for dinner and being encouraged by a friend to go with some of the nigiri specials and my opinion definitely changed! Sometimes what you order makes the difference at a place.   What makes this 5 star worthy and has shot up to one of our favorite places is the nigiri and sashimi as well as the hot dishes off the regular menu. I love that they have a selection of fish that is seasoned for you with a-typical sauce or garnish. I am bored with just some soy; excite me. I absolutely love the JC Style, the snapper 2 ways (shiso/yuzu/salt and balsamic), garlic shrimp. If in season the amberjack, ocean trout and the sardine (forget the name) usually on the specials menu is a must for me. On the kitchen dishes their grilled black cod is fantastic either as entree or lettuce wrap. My husband loves it so much, this ruins sushi at other places, high end and cheaper, for him.   Service is always friendly and attentive.   I feel if you want good sushi, this is THE place.",

I had the following items:  1) Shrimp Tempura, Masago, Cucumber and Cream Cheese Inside with Salmon and Eel Sauce on Top (BOMB. Seriously, I have nothing against cream cheese in my sushi so it was grand. The fish was very, very fresh and tasty as well.)  2) My cousin had Shrimp Tempura Roll with Seared Salmon and Sweet Chili Sauce on top and it was so fresh and the sauce was good as well.  3) Quail Meatball Skewers (Delicious, fresh, and well cooked. It came with a poached egg to dip it in! Yum.)  4) Kalbi Short Ribs with butter lettuce. (This was a wrap and was super tasty!)  5) Salmon Nigiri (Fish was super fresh, but it wasn't anything out of the ordinary. Good price for it though!)  6) Peanut Butter and Chocolate Mochi. (SERIOUSLY. Try it. You won't regret it!)  All of this + two bottles of sake = happy me. It wasn't cheap, but you get what you pay for.  Oh and the service is good! What more could you ask for?",

If you're a sushi purist, make sure to let the sushi chef know, as you may find some of your nigiri covered in light sauces.

I told the sushi chef what fish I was in the mood for (akami tuna, hirame, fluke, hamachi) and he created some spectacular duos (see pictures) - the fish was definitely fresh, although some of his creations were better than others, and some were overpowered by his use of greens, resulting in lack of flavor; Which is why I only give them 4 stars.   The Black Cod soy was phenomenal, but I recommend you share it with someone as the tastes can be a little too much after a few bites.  They have an excellent Sake menu as well. Service was sub par as far as politeness. One of the servers actually shouted across the restaurant while we were dining, so I'm not immediately jumping in my car to try this place again- maybe in a few months.",

The seafood salad was good, the filet mignonette and the cod were fine, but the rest was a blur.  For that, I won't order this prix-fix menu again. My friend ordered the omakase from the sushi bar, in which the chef picked out the sashimi or rolls for you.  All the fish that we had were heavenly.  The toro was the best. I want to take more people here again.",

I used to say whenever I crave Nobu, I come to Sen of Japan, but now I've been to Sen of Japan so often and love it so much I just say I crave Sen of Japan!  The service is always super good, friendly and professional.   Some of my favorites that I must order every time are:  - Mushroom salad - Black cod miso - Fried shrimp with orange aioli sauce - spicy salmon roll (I recently discovered the spicy salmon roll with mango, even better!!! because I love mango) - Eel roll - Chocolate souffle with green tea ice cream  I've also tried the garlic yellowtail and the filet mignon with asparagus, both really good as well! I've also meant to try some of the other items on the menu, but the signature dishes are just so good that I can't not order them!",

The sashimi platter is a waste of money. For $35 I got premium cuts of fish in LA. I do expect to pay more in Vegas. But with paying more, I expect to get good quality food.

My cousin and I shared 3 rolls. Spicy Salmon, Spicy Yellowtail and one that had caramelized onions on the top infant remember the name but it was Delish!  You could also tell the ingredients were very fresh. Located on the corner of Desert Inn & Durango it's very assessable.

    "text": "Went to Sen of Japan a few nights ago, got 6-course Omakase. They asked if it was our first time there, and we responded yes. Probably a *huge* mistake.   1. Yellowtail sashimi w ponzu and toasted garlic. Executed well but uninventive.  2. Sashimi salad - 2x tuna, 2x salmon, 2x albacore sashimi. Greens, dressing, capers. The salad and dressing were good. Tuna was tasteless. Salmon and albacore tasted very good.  3. Clam and miso soup, 2x tuna roll, and nigiri: tuna, salmon, albacore, yellowtail, fluke. Haven't we already had all of these except fluke? Salmon and albacore tasted great as before. Everything else meh. And no interesting pieces of fish. Honestly the fish at jjanga has been comparable IME and that's $25 AYCE and I get way more variety.  4. Miso black cod w wasabi aioli and eel sauce reduction. The absolute nuts. Everyone has a miso black cod, but this might be the best I've eaten. Very much the saving grace of this meal, and the only reason I'd consider coming back.  5. Beef tenderloin w asparagus and greens in a mustard sauce. Meat was barely flavored. Mustard sauce saved the day. But Jesus, good meat like this shouldn't need saving with a mustard sauce...  6. Dessert: green tea ice cream and chocolate souffle. Ice cream was not overly smoky (a problem with a lot of green tea flavored desserts) but it also barely tasted like green tea. Souffle was good but pretty standard.  Look, I get it: 6 course omakase for $55. I wasn't expecting Kabuto or Yui. But I felt like the offerings were completely uninteresting and for something designed that simple, every dish needs to be perfect, even @$55. This fell way flat.  Here's my real gripe: I felt like we totally got the gringo treatment as the host or mgr continually told us how his chefs would create off-menu experiences for repeat customers. Like wtf we just dropped $180 on dinner and drinks, off-strip, and you gave us one really good and 5 mediocre dishes. So what, we're supposed to come back and do it again and hope it's better next time? I asked what would be on a sample \"repeat\" omakase menu, and he just said \"whatever's freshest and whatever the chef thinks would be best.\"   Well, what the **** was the \"omakase\" I ordered? It's not really omakase if you give everyone the same intro-to-sushi menu. They should call whatever this was something like the \"Sen 6-course prix fixe.\" Honestly I'd prefer it if they'd call it something that people who know good food would never in a million years order -- maybe the \"Samurai Special.\"  I think it's a mistake to think people haven't had good Japanese food before, especially in this town.  I have foodie friends who eat there a LOT and rave about the food. And I've read a ton of reviews about the quality of their fish. But I'll have a hard time going back anytime soon when I can spend less for more at dozens of places in town. Really pretty upset in hindsight, especially since I took my wife for her birthday and was super excited based on what I'd heard and read.   Waitstaff was friendly and engaging. Restaurant was clean and inviting, including restrooms.",

All the dishes were spot on, super fresh, well sauced.  My only issue was that the portions seemed a bit small, even for a \"tasting menu\".  Still, was worth the price.  Although for a $30 difference for the 6 course Omakase is probably an even better value at $55.  The service was attentive, friendly and competent.  Would definitely go back, especially compared to some of the Strip's sushi options (and prices).",

    "text": "Let me begin by saying that I liked this restaurant's design and rolls I had were actually quite good.  Although I was at the sushi bar, the waitress who served drinks and edamame was actually fantastic.  Why only 2 stars then?  Funny you should ask.  While sitting at the sushi bar watching one of the chef's prepare someone else's nigiri, I happened to catch him proceed to throw the fish down on the preparation surface to flatten it a couple times, and then some error in trajectory resulted in the 3rd throw landing on the floor in front of him.  He picked it up, washed it off in the sink, looked right at me, and then laid it neatly across a rice ball.  It went onto a plate with several others and off to a table it went.  Call me crazy, but there is no 5 second rule in restaurants!  Washing it off doesn't change that rule!  So, a few minutes later, while conversing with my dinner partner, the same chef, who appeared to be more tenured or the ranking official behind the sushi bar, called out to the waitress behind us and scolded her abruptly about a customer waiting for a to-go order.  She happened to be directly behind me and not only was it rude and inappropriate to do so in front of customers, but it totally stopped our dinner conversation dead in it's tracks.  She responded that it was being taken care of and went about her business.  I think I just sat there with a dumbfounded look on my face.  Sufficed to say, there are many excellent sushi choices in Las Vegas.  I prefer one that takes values sanitary practices in preparation of the food and where the staff is a little more pleasant to one another.  This will likely be my first and last visit to this establishment.",

It was, for the most part, underwhelming: a forgettable sashimi salad, a lackluster lobster salad, and something else that I forgot about.  The black cod \"soy\" (sound familiar?..hmmm...) was very well done and had tons of flavor. What's more it was topped with a nice fatty piece of foie gras which accentuated the already rich flavors of the miso...OOPS...I mean \"soy\" glaze. The dish also had a drizzle of wasabi sauce which cut through some of that richness.  The main course was a barely grilled (looked almost poached) filet mignon with a miso dressing. The sauce was good, but the filet lacked seasoning and didn't have much flavor to speak of.  The best part about this place is the nigiri. The fish is, of course, fresh, but the garnishes are so unique and so beautifully executed that I completely forgot about the disappointing previous dishes. Yuzu with garlic, truffle oil and chopped chile, etc. Really good stuff.  A cheap knock off of Nobu is still a compliment in my eyes, but this place is much more than that. Nice work guys. I'll be back soon.",

    "text": "Easily one of the best meals that I've had in Las Vegas.  I have dined at Nobu, Michael Mina, Wing Lei, and several other restaurants featuring \"celebrity chefs\". The food here was on par with anything that I've had at those places, at a fraction of the price, and with *none* of the attitude.  My friend and I each ordered the \"Omakase\" (Chef's choice tasting menu). At first I found the portions to be a bit small, but by the end of the meal, I was thankful for that I didn't get too much too soon. There was *plenty* of food.  The sushi and sashimi were fresh and wonderful, and with delicate sauces for accompaniment.   As others have mentioned, the Black Cod in miso glaze with seared foie gras was one of the best things that I've ever put in my mouth.   The big surprise for me was the filet Mignon. To be honest; I haven't had red meat in over twenty years, so maybe I'm not the best judge of this - but the steak was SO flavorful. the texture was perfect, and the gentle citrus/mustard glaze seemed to hit every taste bud in my mouth all at the same time. It was almost overwhelmingly delicious. I would bring my Meat-and-Potatoes father from Nebraska here just for the steak.  The service was wonderful; with a friendly wait staff that seemed to love answering questions about the food. They were present when you needed them, and gone when you didn't . Just as it should be.  This is not a fancy place. It feels like almost any other strip-mall sushi joint. Jeans and T-shirts would not be out of place.  But the food...! I'll just say that my date expressed his joy quite passionately later in the evening. I'm not saying that going to Sen of Japan is a guarantee that you'll get some...but I wouldn't rule it out.",

The service, food and atmosphere (inside the restaurant) are all fantastic. My wife and I went here on our anniversary and it was awesome.  Shinji knows how to take care of customers and makes sure the food is top notch.  It's not on the strip, but it's worth the trip if you're staying there and want a great Japanese food experience.",

Their 6-7 course menu never ceases to please me and they adjust it to fit your taste preferences. I also enjoy their salmon and black cod. Hope this helps!",

    "text": "I probably should of wrote this review when I lived in Vegas but I think I was being selfish since it's been my secret Sushi place for years, and when I mean years, I only took my most special friends and best clients here. Why? Because I'm selfish and didn't want anyone else taking over my dinner dining times. Yes folks that's how good it is.  While Vegas has a ton of sushi options from Nobu to the strip mall AYCE places, this is by far the best sushi place in Vegas. From the consistently excellent service to the freshly prepared sushi to how it's prepared, this is a nice place to have dinner.  You will not go wrong in ordering anything off their menu, I have never had a bad mea herel ever. In fact, the food/taste experience just gets better and better. As far as quality, this is on par with Shibuya in Calabasas. Sashimi is fresh, melts in your mouth and you can't get enough. It's not as pricey as Nobu but be aware as you are in Summerlin and I've had meals here with 2-3 people that go into the $300 plus checks because of the smaller almost petite portions.  Best advice if you want a meal where you can devour each piece of sushi, get there early, as there's always a line and the restaurant has a very intimate if not tight seating area. No worries on dress code also, it's casual and not a white table place. Enjoy everyone!",

The menu is quite extensive and has something for everyone. Very innovative offerings on the sushi as well. They also have a late night happy hour that starts at 10:30 pm. This is the only place I will go to for sushi from here on.",

    "text": "I have been to Sen of Japan prior to my review.  Their food was wonderful & reminded me of Japan. This time I was very disappointed. I had a very pushy & insincere Server. I don't recall her name but, she was overly \"nice\" to the point of being scary. Too nice, trying too hard. I don't like that kind of people, who act graciatingly nice & you know it's so fake. It's the type of Service performance you see in most cookie cutter Restaurants that want overly gracious people \"performing\" for a tip.  I felt that she was pushing my friend & I to buy more & more food to bring up the bill. The thing is, she didn't know a lot about cold  Sake which would've brought up the bill to over $100 easily when I was asking her questions. After all with only two people in the party we can only eat so much food before getting too full.  Speaking of the food, it wasn't the same. The service was so slow. The miso soup took too long. I think maybe she forgot it. And then when we mentioned it again, she brought us our miso soups. I understand Sushi does take time but, the Restaurant wasn't that busy. We were getting really hungry. Finally the food came to our table & it wasn't as good as I remembered it. The quality wasn't the same. It was a shame because I was raving to my friend about this place. How the quality was as good as some of the Japanese restaurants on the Strip. Oh well. After we got our Sushi we really didn't want to order more food. She did try to sell some entrees that weren't from the sushi bar. But we weren't going to spend more $$ in that place. Hopefully they will fix this problem & the pushy insensere waitress who gave up being nice after she realized she wasn't going to get a big check out of us.",

The health inspector was there which delayed our meal. That is okay on its own but things got progressively worse. With the entree came a salad and it was everything but a salad. It was a spring mix and a big pile but it was not a salad. I don't know how the idea of going to get a meal being a luxury could be aligned with a bag of mix greens as is. After an hour , the people behind us who got seated half an hour after us got their food but we were waiting on our appetizers. Finally they came and then the entree which was a steak. It looked boiled and not cooked correctly. They took another 40 minutes and by that time I cancelled the dinner because it's unacceptable to wait almost two hours without food while people around us got theirs and the servers question why I don't like the food as if they can't tell it looked like shit. Horrible service. Will not be returning ever. After 12 years of eating there we were treated horribly.",

    "text": "Date night with my lady brought us to one of our favorite sushi places on the Westside. Nestled in an unpretentious strip mall between Twain and Desert Inn on the west side of Durango, this restaurant is easy to get to and has lots of easy parking.  This was our 4th visit. I wouldn't have done a review except for the few notable issues we encountered that night. First of all, the fish (and other food items) are superb! Nuff' said. If you go, expect quality, firm sushi and fresh veggies, etc (the tempura is divine). The atmosphere is quite pleasant with lots of space between tables, a lovely decor, more than pleasant staff willing to go an extra kilometer or two, and even nondescript background music (an important feature for us as we concentrate on the dining experience).  We walked in sans reservations and were given a table post-haste by two very pleasant greeters.  Now the challenges: in almost all restaurants, food is either served in stages \"coursed out\" based on appetizers, mains, deserts, etc. ... unless one requests everything be brought out at the same time. One exception is the sushi house. Sushi places customarily take your list of items when you order, and reserve the right to bring you what they want ... when they want. The diner rarely gets to specify the order of items received. This is customary and gives the kitchen the option to juggle all the orders and keep most parties eating something most of the time. I'm not a fan however. I prefer to get ALL my sushi items together so I can decide WHAT I want to eat and WHEN I eat it. Alas Sen of Japan doesn't work that way, and I deal with it. On this night however, our items were widely spaced: we would get something, eat it, and have to wait 5-15 minutes for the next item. On one occasion, I waited almost 30 minutes for a particular nigiri order. I was not happy.  I had received my toro (fatty) salmon early, and because it's one of my fave's, I placed it aside as my \"desert\". I moved it away from my plate area while I waited for the rest of my order. Our server (who knowingly saw us waiting impatiently) came over and lifted my \"desert\" plate and moved it in front of me. I said, \"Please leave that there.\" He apologized.  Nevertheless, despite the quality food, the dining experience that night was soured by the excessive waiting. Since we had dined there previously, I assume they were short-staffed and we will go back. However, it did cost them 1 star for this review.",

Who in the world is open at midnight?  Lots of places in Chinatown.  Except I was lazy to drive out further.    Surprisingly not too far away, Sen of Japan is open til 1:30am!  Whaaaat... Yeah let's go!  Omgosh look - its across MadHouse Coffee.  Could be a great thing... :D  Happy hour menu til 1:30 too???!  I like these kinda surprises!  What's to order: - Baked Escolar is baked super white tuna w/jalapeno pesto sauce topped w/pumpkin tempura red pepper corn.  This is superb!  One of the fancier items on their HH menu.  It's small but powered with flavor! - Cut sushi rolls like Spicy scallop, Alaska roll topped w/seared salmon, and freshwater eel.  Okay maybe you have to have a thing for these choices.  The flavor was a little different than just simple nigiri sushi.  But suggesting to at least try em out.  Eel was my fave. - No.1 spicy albacore top tuna was something we ordered first, but it came out second to last.  Irony? Yes and it was just okay.  Not number one for me.  They didn't save the best for last... It was different.  I would've preferred plain unfancy nigiri for both the albacore and tuna separately. - Salmon carpaccio was the absolute last served to our table.  And this hit homerun for my taste buds.  This definitely I would order again!  The interior is really clean and proper as you would expect a typical Japanese restaurant to appear.  Check out their sake collection!  Huge sake bottles lining a countertop and stored in their ref.  Nice ambience and cool music, though not traditional music.    Service was pretty professional for a late night meal.  So impressed with how the dishes were explained by the young man; even how he hand gestured to point palm up and detail the ingredients.  Wait...was he the chef?!",

    "text": "I don't get it.  Sen has 4 1/2 stars with over 100 reviews.  It's Michelin rated.  What it doesn't have is food to match.    Our party of five was eager to try what was purportedly one of the best sushi restaurants in town.  We drove all the way from Hendo - in rush hour traffic - just to eat here.  On the way, we decided that we should do the omakase and let the chef put his best foot forward.  Here's what was served:  1.  Yellowtail with peppers and garlic chip - the presentation was wonderful, but the flavors were overpowering.  The ponzu was too strong for such a subtle fish.  The addition of garlic and a spicy habanero (or jalapeno?) just kills any chance you can taste the fish, let alone feel the texture of it while your mouth burns.    2.  Mizuna salad with salmon, tuna and albacore - This would have been a nice dish, had it come before the spice of the yellowtail.  In fact, this is how good, fresh fish should be served: with very little detraction.  As an individual dish, however, I'd rather just have thick cuts of sashimi instead of thin cuts of fish with a salad on the side.    3.  Soy Miso Block Cod - really good execution of one of my favorites.  Only downside was that I didn't have a bowl of rice to go with it.  By itself, it was supremely tasty and buttery.  4.  Fliet Mignon tataki - this was good and tender, but lost in sauce.  Fliet has zero flavor profile, so covering it with any sauce really just makes the meat a sauce delivery vehicle.  Chalk it up to personal preference. Also a personal preference: I would really have liked it to be medium RARE rather than medium well.    5.  Miso soup with clams - delicious.  This was the highlight of the meal.  The combination of clams and miso just hit the rights notes or flavor and smell.  Really good stuff.  I could have just had a couple bowls of this with miso cod and called it a night.  6.  Nigiri - The fish looked and tasted fresh, but the texture of the salmon was slightly mushy.  The rice was really good, with just the right about of koshi that makes me happy.  +1 for the rice.  7.  Chocolate souffle with green tea ice cream - I love green tea ice cream and this didn't disappoint.  The souffle, however, was another matter.  It was hard and nowhere near as fluffy or light as it should be.  IMHO, if you offer it on your menu, you need to execute it well or don't bother.  Being hungry after all that, we ordered two additional rolls:  8.  #24 (Shrimp tempura with tuna on top with pineapple wasabi) - This is one of my least favorite rolls...ever.  The sushi itself probably was good, but the sauce killed any chance me wanting to take another bite.  It was too sweet and too much of it all over the roll.    9.  #25 California roll with soft shell crab - this one at once pretty good and also fairly standard.  I'd probably choose this if I didn't know what else to try.  I liked this place, but it's a tough sell at 4 stars.  Out of 9 items, only 2 stood out as things I would make it a point to order again.    I've read the reviews.  I've heard the raves.  I finally tried Sen.  I just don't get what the fuss is all about.",

I probably would have ever stopped had it not been for the exceptional reviews.  Sushi restaurants are a dime-a-dozen in Vegas and I'm so pleased to have somewhere to replace Kona Grill. The food is twice as good, and you don't have to put up with drunk, over-40 Summerlin housewives trying to re-live their 20's.  The service was terrific, the recommendations made by our waitress were spot on, and even the chocolate souffle (not exactly a Japanese desert) with green tea gelato was incredible.  I highly recommend and will be back very soon.",

At the Bar:  Fresh Water Eel with Creamy Scallop (#5): 8 pieces, topped with eel sauce.. Eel with scallop, I can't think of a much better combination, so I went with it.. It was good but lacking something?.. something that would give it that edge for praise..  Black Cod Soy: filet of fish, served with a pepper on top, nice presentation and every slice just flaked off. Had a sweet, mild wine flavor.. Not as common as the usual usual salmon/tuna.. I'm used to but it satisfied.   Halibut with Truffle Sashimi: This was suggested by the chef behind the bar counter. When he mentioned Halibut, I was sold, then he mentioned truffle and truffle oil.. I started salivating.. 2 super thin slices of halbiut, a couple truffle nuggets on top and a drizzle truffle oil.. 6 Stars, easy!!  Atmosphere was live (at least at the bar) and the japanese sophisticated clean decor paired with their menu offerings nicely. Service was Awesome and Prices were reasonable. Keeping in mind all the other Japanese restaurants out there for comparison, that are laying down some serious food, I feel this place is just short of a 5 star review from this dining experience alone..",

It's no wonder that there are many signature dishes that taste and look similar to Nobu. There are small ingredients that are different but overall it tastes delicious for half the price. They also have an awesome happy hour menu making my black cod lettuce wraps only $2 a piece! woop woop! Our waitress was very attentive and helpful. I will definitely come back anytime for my expensive cravings for Nobu. I love that I can get my salmon carpaccio, my rock shrimp tempura with orange ponzu, black cod butter lettuce, a few sushi rolls, and last but not least my chocolate souffle with green tea or sub vanilla bean ice cream bento box! yummy! give me more",

We went during happy hour (currently 10:30pm-1:30am Mon-Sat), so the prices were great. Unfortunately, to put it lightly, the service was lacking. I'm too frustrated to bother with details. I hesitated even writing this review in the first place. The bottom line for me is that there are plenty of sushi places in Vegas with good to great sushi and good to great service. I don't need to return. Luckily for SoJ, they have enough of a following (100+ reviews) that my lowly 1-star won't affect their stellar average at all.",

It's a little bit of a haul (15-20 minutes from the strip) so you really have to be in the mood for sushi.  As far as other dishes, I would recommend you not expend the cab fare. While the black cod soy and hamachi kama were good,  I'm just not that big a fan of cod or hamachi. The asparagus and avocado tempura were relatively flavorless and the beef, chicken and shrimp skewers were either overcooked or poor cuts of meat. Avoid the skewers!  The service was acceptable but we had a little bit of a language barrier. They were nice and got the food out quick without overlap in dishes. The atmosphere was cool.  The verdict - outstanding sushi - meh everything else - you have to really be in the mood for sushi given the drive.  Smiley face",

Also the famous black cod dish is worth every bit of notoriety, does not disappoint.  The best part of Sen, though, is the original items that the chefs randomly produce if you're at the bar.  wow what a fun place to eat.  My only complaint is the bizarre behavior of the host, whoever it happens to be, literally every time we go.  Also heard this from some friends of mine who go there.  They Always say there are no tables, even when there are more than 3 empty.  Don't get me wrong it's a busy restaurant, and they've only been outright rude once.  It's just that so often we sit at the bar and no one ever comes for the tables during our 90 minute dinner.  The one time we did make a reservation 4 hours in advance they didn't honor it!  It's more funny than anything else I guess.  Tolerable as this place is just so awesome.  Just sometimes I wish hosts realized they didn't make the restaurant special, the chef did.",

No matter how the manager tried to appease her she got louder and became increasingly nasty / unreasonable to the point the manager needed to call the police. \"Please call the police\" she said, and when he did she pretended to go to the restroom and then slithered out the back door. We felt bad for the other patrons and parents. This is a classic example of how some people will publicly threaten an otherwise reputable establishment with a negative Yelp review.  This wasn't her first time behaving this way; her other reviews reveal similar behavior. Our meal and service was perfect as it always is but some people are out looking a fight or leverage a free meal.  When she finally slithered out the back door the other patrons, ourselves included were glad to see her go. This restaurant has excellent sushi and other meals to fit any appetite.

I've come at 5PM when they first serve dinner and the restaurant is slow, during the normal dinner rush, and I've been here for the late night happy hour. We've always had different waiters/waitresses every time, but this last time, the waitress was a bit obtrusive and we only received one menu for two people. Then she thought I was finished looking at the menu and took it, and placed it on the seat across from me. It was strange. Just leave the menu alone! Needless to say, the service needs a bit of work.  Now the food is really good. The black cod rivals Nobu's and the sushi is very fresh. I've tried a lot of different things on the menu and I have to say, I have yet to find something I do not like.  The only thing I dislike are the prices. It is a bit expensive, especially if you opt for the foie gras add-on. Ahh...I found something I do not like...whoops! The foie gras. (I love foie gras!) The add-on foie gras is tiny and is an additional ~$14. And when I had it, it was not cooked well, nor paired well. I think they should take it off the menu until they can prepare it better. However, their omakase and other Japanese food items are very good. Now, if the service was better, I'd feel better about the prices.",

Honestly, I've ordered the entire special menu a few times thru and there isn't a bad dish on the menu. Everything is prepared with the utmost care and thoughtfulness.   My favorites off the top of my head are the eel with kiwi, the scallop with lime dressing, the akami, japanese snapper two ways, and the list goes on an on. If you are looking for super traditional preparation they have that as well but the fun of going here is the creativity of the chefs. They have serious skill and everytime I come I leave amazed. Must visit.",

Garlic yellowtail, delicious. A fish with capers and truffle oil, incredible and one of our servers' recommendations so I can't remember the type of fish. The fried diver scallops, my ultimate favorite! #2 roll, delicious, needed no soy sauce or wasabi!! Ordered 2nds of the scallops, and then toro. I can't believe it took me so long to come here. Definitely my favorite now! Thank you to the amazing staff!!",

I think I only got five courses but if they count the miso soup that came with the sushi as another course...then it's a six course omakase. The sushi was okay but their grilled fish was fantastic. Probably wouldn't be back here again due to the plethora of sushi joints in this area.",

We didn't have a reservation and were seated quickly. This was on a weekend, after going to another sushi restaurant with an hour-plus wait and deciding to try Sen after it was suggested to us numerous times. My mother is Japanese, born and raised in Japan, and she enjoyed this place more than any of the other sushi restaurants I've taken her to on the west side. It's a little dark inside but creates a nice intimate environment. Parking is plentiful, as well, which is always a good thing IMO.",

The quality of the fish that you will find here is outstanding. The food is also prepared very well. I've never walked out of this place unsatisfied.  The ambiance of the restaurant is somewhat romantic...the lighting is dim and the music puts you at ease...perfect to where you can hear the other party but not have to constantly be conversing to avoid awkward silences.   My favorite item on the menu is the Black Cod Miso with Foie Gras. The dish is just delicious! The sauce is so addicting!!! Sweet but not too sweet where it overpowers the fish...I found myself dragging the last piece all over the plate to make sure that I had every last drop.   Their desserts are also amazing. They serve Bubbies mochi icecream which is a popular brand that comes from Hawaii !! Their chocolate souffle with green tea ice cream is a must try for those who love chocolate!! The souffle is made to order and served hot fresh out of the oven. Out server always suggests this to us while we are ordering our main dishes so they they could get a head start.  It is perfectly gooey and lava like on the inside and crisp on the outside like a delicious souffle should be.  They also had a wide variety of Sake to choose from if you enjoy that with your meal. Overall the service is fantastic. The food is impeccable. Sen of Japan just does it right.   *****1030-130 happy hour!!!",

We were a party of six who were there about six months ago. Had high expectations based on reviews and recommendations and was rather underwhelmed. It was rather forgettable. That's ok considering nothing bad, I guess. It was just all right. Not fair to give a low star rating because everything tastes as it should and was good. I guess I was expecting great. With izakayas and robata grills and omakase and basically places like Raku around, it's hard not to make such comparisons. Granted, this place isn't like any of those and is just a classic sushi restaurant but even the flavors offered don't give us anything much more interesting than maybe a ponzu sauce.",

    "text": "Came here for late night happy hour after reading so many positive yelp reviews about it.  Thanks guys! I've only ever ordered take out from here.  I found my new favorite late night place and it's close to home for me.  Woo hoo!   The service was fantastic too!  Tomoyo was very personable,  knowledgeable, and attentive. Everything she recommended was very very good!    I eat a lot of Japanese food around town so I think it's safe to say I have a lot to compare with hehe. I like this place also because it's a bit of fusion. There are a few menus to choose from late night.  So we ordered away . EVERYTHING we had was incredibly fresh and extremely delicious!  Some items we ordered....  Peppered albacore on the specials menu. Gotta try this if you're a fan of these two things.  Try it if you're not.  It comes with a butter sauce. The texture was so soft. It almost melts in your mouth.   Asari (clam) miso soup.  It came with a few clams in their shell.  Very fresh and full of flavor. The clams really complemented their miso soup.  Tamago sushi. You can tell a lot about a sushi place just by their tamago. Made in house and it was the right balance of sweet for the egg,  very fluffy.  They do it right.   Kamasu nigiri.  Japanese barracuda.  On special guys., I don't see this too often.  Served with fresh wasabi olive oil. Incredible!  Soft in texture. Very fresh. I would highly recommend this if you like to try different nigiri or fish.   A few from late night happy hour menu:  Black cod lettuce cups.  Come on I couldn't pass this up after all you yelpers talked so highly of it.  And yes. It was as good as everyone says it is.  Must try.  Nice and light and packed with flavor.   Tempura shrimp with orange aioli.  I'm not usually big on the mayo dishes but this was good.  It came cut into pieces and tossed in an orange aioli. Also had mandarin oranges in there, nice touch.   Salmon carpaccio.  Wow! Buttery and super fresh pieces of salmon lightly seared on one side.  My picture down there was of it half eaten.  It's a great value on the happy hour menu.  Try it if you like salmon!  We ordered much more than this! And we LOVED everything. (See receipt pic)  Desserts were pretty epic! Out of the two we tried, both made in house ( see pics below) my favorite was the almond flanjipan with pineapple sorbet and mountain peach. It was hot and very moist.  reminded me of a pineapple upside down cake and flavored with almond extract. The tart sorbet balanced the sweetness of the cake.  Very well thought out dessert and flavor combination.  I love how they offer mochi ice cream from Bubbies, Hawaii.  I'm from there and this is a popular local company back home. They make really great flavors.   Had a great dinner and can't wait to come back again to explore and try more things on the menus! Hopefully I can catch our same server.",

    "text": "Probably not much I can add that hasn't already been written, but after having been only one week into my visit I've already eaten at Sen of Japan twice with friends.  We were in groups both times, and I got to sample many of the dishes on the menu.   I wish I could give it 3.5 stars instead, because they did have some delicious dishes that are also beautifully presented and the service is mostly good, but the place seems inconsistent.   One day the pork belly is fork-tender and the next visit it's brought to the table almost at room temperature, a bit stringy and difficult to take apart.    The sashimi and marinated fish dishes are mostly very good. Anything with yellowtail there is incredible and so is the filet mignon tataki. The giant maki rolls, especially ones with cooked elements, are hit or miss. They're showy and trying to give customers lots of variety, but it's overarching and tends to either miss the mark or just be a jumble of flavors that don't always work well together. The #16 roll (salmon tempura roll with seared scallops in mayo sauce) is a prime example. It was pretty bad.  One friend who wasn't a fan of sushi but came along in the group ordered the filet mignon citrus soy and offered me a bit. The steak itself was good, but it was drowned in a goopy almost sickly sweet sauce that reminded me of bad teriyaki. A terrible thing to do to a fine cut of beef.  As far as sushi restaurants in Vegas go, you could certainly do far worse. The quality is good overall and prices are reasonable for the food and experience. It's worth a try if you're visiting and want to go off Strip for dinner, if you're a local living on the Westside, it's a near-must.   I'll likely return again, but now I know which dishes to probably stick to, and which ones I shouldn't bother with.",

    "text": "Yelper's, I thank thee!      We were visiting Red Rock Resort  for the weekend and were looking for a great sushi place.   We never would have discovered this jewel of a sushi place without you.  This place is a solid 4.5 stars.  Sitting at the sushi bar we had a great sushi chef, and an *incredible* server: on top of it throughout the night, and a fantastic personality and smile to boot.  Our server recommended the [$20 daily special] bamboo carafe of sake  -- Wakatake Junmai Genshu.   It went down smooth....almost too smooth. :)     We ordered a couple of big bottles of beer as well.  Our favorite roll, the #17 -- Spicy Spider Roll -- Yum!    As we ate it we thought \"Where is the spipce\"....but then, a minute or so after eating the first piece, we felt the nice afterburn.   We had both the Albacore Salad and the Sashimi Salad; we really enjoyed them both.   Too bad the Albacore Salad didn't have as much sashimi as the sashimi salad; nonetheless it was damn tasty.  The salmon sashimi was quite buttery and tasty as well.  I tried a black cod appetizer in a lettuce leaf.... it reminded me of a savory fish taco where lettuce was used in lieu of a tortilla.  Thumbs up again.  Place was a rock solid 5 until our last two orders.    We tried the special Kanpachi nigiri (with a garlic chip), of which neither of us cared for the texture of the fish.   We also tried the #1 roll, which was a bit disapppointing when it came to flavors.   Neither were bad, but they didn't hold a candle to the flavors and textures of stuff we had prior.  Taking the last two orders into account along with the $116 pre-tip price tag, the place finished out as a very solid 4.5 stars.  And I am hit with the Yelper's dilemma, to round up or down:  I choose because of the excellent server and sushi chef who really made it an enjoyable time!  As Arnold famously said \"I'll be back!\"",

Sashimi Salad (the one not listed on the menu-ask the server)- good!  Mochi ice cream- Mango is the best Tofu Eggplant Agedashi- good Sashimi-  tuna, albacore and yellowtail here is really good.  The salmon is just eh Seafood Ceviche with Kiwi- Just okay but worth a try Curry Sushi- Interesting Filet Mignon Citrus Soy- Ok Almond Yuzu Franjipan- Good  I would definitely like to come back to try more dishes.

    "text": "My spouse and I celebrated her  bday in Vegas and decided to eat a special dinner off the strip.  After looking around we found Sen of Japan on Yelp.  After reading the reviews, we both decided it would be a great place to try.  Upon finding the location in a common looking strip mall, I was initially unimpressed.  We walked in and I turned to my spouse and said, \"I'm glad that we didn't get dressed up\".  After that everything went perfectly.    John, the server was so great.  We told him we were from San Francisco and he said \" you must be foodies\".  We told him that we came for the  OMAKASE SPECIAL  I knew it was pricey but it wasn't the first time, we'd drop over $60 per person at a sushi place.  Since it was a special occasion and I had planned on spending about $100 per person, the price  of $85 per person was expected.    We were given an impeccable 8 course menu.  John absolutely knew the menu well and was able to recite what we were being given without it seeming rehearsed.  The sashimi  was outstanding and so fresh.  The sauces on the sushi were creative and had a great balance of flavors as well as being beautiful to the eye.  The dishes that came from the kitchen were wonderful and though we didn't necessarily agree on which dish was our favorite, we definitely felt that the sushi chef gets an A for effort as well as an A for taste and presentation.    The wait staff was so friendly and helpful including the Sake choice.  We were not disappointed.  This place doesn't have the curb appeal of the strip.  What it does have is creativity that clearly shows the love of the chefs.  The chef actually came out to ask us if all was okay and wanted to genuinely know how we felt about the dishes.  Some were a bit tart and others a bit on the sweet side, but no soy sauce was ever used nor encouraged to be use as each bite needed to be experienced as the chef intended and not masked by soy.  When returning to Vegas, we'll be sure to stop by again.  Perhaps this time just to have an ordinary dinner which I'm sure will still be well above grade.",

    "text": "Finally got a chance to dine here and I was very impressed.  Every person from chefs to servers were friendly and attentive.  The Nobu influence is very unmistakeable.  We had the $55 omakaze tasting menu (#1 of 4 from what I'm told).  I see the others have already listed the dishes served with the omakaze #1 so I won't bore you with the details of each dish, I'll just make a couple comments.  Yellowtail with jalapenos and sashimi salad were excellent, very fresh fish.  Miso cod, I'm kinda over this dish (probably had it once too many times at Nobu) but they do execute it very well here.  Filet Mignon - unexpected but solid.  Mixed sushi - nice to be able to sample all their fish - I liked the hamachi and salmon a lot but absolutely loved the halibut.  I felt the cake and ice cream were uninspired and the cake not that good.  Also a little heavy to end that meal with.    You must must must order the uni here.  If you've never had uni before this is the place to try it for your first time.  I thought I'd had good uni before but this was head and shoulders above the rest.  $55/man with two people tax and tip plus the order of uni it was $160, not cheap but half the price of Nobu Hard Rock and imo a much better meal.  I will report back when I return for omakazes #2 - #4.  Hopefully soon.",

The waitress Tiffany had the menu locked down and for someone who was not familiar with this type of food she knew what I would like and aced it. The GM was dropping by regularly to make sure we were taken care of by the staff and check on the quality of the food. Now for the food, it is hard to say anything could have been better the sashimi was so fresh you could have dropped it in water and it would have swam away. The rolls were world class rolled to perfection and OMG fresh. If you are looking for the best, freshest and friendliest sushi restaurant you need not look further than Sen of Japan thanks for the great time, and did I mention the prices were very reasonable for the class of food received.",

    "text": "Proof that some of the best food in Vegas resides OFF the Strip.  Use this for reassurance as you make the illogical 15min drive away from the bright lights.  The owner Chef Shinji made us a fabulous meal on the fly since the BF and I got there at 1am, too late for the $55/$85 omakase dinners.  It was a very, very happy accident; our meal turned out to be no less than authentic Japanese perfection (fresh fish & simmered/stewed dishes are the stars, not the rolls).  ++ | Chef's choice at the sushi bar | Chef Shinji's strength is knowing the clear difference btwn traditional & Japanese fusion.  He can prepare a lovely traditional meal, though I'm completely in love with his fusion nigiri creations.  Each piece is steeped in traditional flavor/technique with just a smidgen of hip nuance.  Did I also mention that he's very, very generous with uni?  Hot Appetizers if you're just starving: - Black Cod Butter Lettuce Wraps: the cod sat in the stewing pot too long for my tastes. - Shrimp Tempura with Orange Sauce: the shrimp is shelled and has nice flavor, but it reminds me of chinese honey walnut prawns - Calamari: lightly quick-fried so it's got great soft texture. The ponzu flavor is refreshing but not extraordinary  For the best Japanese in Vegas during Happy Hr (11p-2a?): Dinner for 2 = $40/person",

    "text": "I must admit I was a bit skeptical when the taxi approached this somewhat divey restaurant. And frankly it's not even that divey, but after seeing all the over the top restaurant on the strip, it's hard to compare from a decor perspective.   John our waiter was top notch. He was incredibly knowledgeable and very personable.  We really enjoyed his service.   Now for the most important part - the food! Sen of Japan is 15 minutes from the strip, but well worth the trip.   While I'm a big fan of dipping my sushi in soy sauce, also love to have a piece of ginger with all pieces. My habits changed! I didn't want to compromise the incredible flavors of the fish.   The sushi was fresh and ALL melted in your mouth. Each piece had it's own sauce. Amazing flavors. While all pieces tried were fantastic, I think my fav was the o-toro. It was so buttery I couldn't help but smile after I finished.  The tempura was delicious. It wasn't super greasy, which made a difference.  Black Cod miso with Foie Gras, yes Foie Gras! I was delighted to see this on the menu because I'm a HUGE fan. It was perfection. You must try this dish! The curry spiced shrimp tempura maki was a recommendation of John. Loved it! Thanks John for this suggestion. My bf isn't a huge fan of curry yet he enjoyed this roll.   I can't stop raving over our experience at this fabulous restaurant. We simply had the best time.   Thanks to my BF for researching sushi places in the area and thanks for all you that reviewed that got us here. This place is amazing!!",

    "text": "Hit Sen last night with the gf.  I've been to Sen about four times - yet my first review of the place. This place is clearly my  fav non-strip sushi restaurant in Las Vegas.  In fact, it might just be my fav sushi spot period.    Located in a non-descript strip mall on desert inn ( across from TC's Rib Crib and It's a grind - that place was hoppin' last night )  - it's a simple, clean, comfortable restaurant.  The service is top-notch.  Twice, i dropped my napkin on the floor and twice the server was there with a fresh napkin before i could blink an eye.  We decided to go large  - the $85/ person omakase. - 3 cold courses, 2 hot courses and dessert.  started with a couple oysters topped with a sweet onion salsa and then a yellowtail with a daikon and fried green  onion filling - both were very fresh, refreshing.  the gf and i are usually not fans of oysters - we're having 2nd thoughts.  next up - a sashimi salad with an amazing light, citrus-y dressing - the sashimi included ahi tuna, salmon and scallop -  the flavor buds are dancin' now !  1st hot dish - lobster with a lemon grass sauce - lobster was lightly grilled - the sauce - lemon-y, but it did not have that thai -influenced flavor i expected when lemongrass is used.  Next up - seared filet mignon with crisp  sweet potato / potato shavings and asparagus with a mustard sauce - holy cow , perfect tenderness, the mustard was not too heavy - all good !  the last cold dish - sushi - salmon, shrimp, yellow tail, mako and a couple pieces of ahi roll.  The yellowtail and mako - awesome.  a little disappointed that they include boring shrimp - it was good though. also included a coup of miso and clam soup - great.  finished with a molten chocolate cake and green tea ice cream.  chocolate molten cake never gets old for me - it has some unusual spicing in it - i forgot to ask the server what was in it - had a slight spice to it, but i don't think it was a pepper source.    I was saddened to see how little biz they had when we were there - i hope it was just a slow night because this place is a gem.",

They serve sashimi dishes using fresh citrus which are edible art -there really aren't words . . . you really just have to experience Sen of Japan. I don't think I've ever used soy sauce here, it just isn't needed. The rolls are delicious too, but I believe it is the quality and plating of the sashimi which sets them apart from all other sushi restaurants in the U.S. This never disappoints, I've been coming here every time in Vegas for the past 14 years and every time I eat here it gets better! If you're not willing to pay for the freshest fish this may not be right for you. It truly doesn't get any better than this.",

    "text": "TEMPURA HEAVEN, SUSHI PURGATORY, & AIOLI HELL  The tempura here is among the best I've ever had.  They must use liquid nitrogen in their batter or something because the result is tempura that is amazingly crisp and light.  Truth be told I came here for sushi, but the kambocha pumpkin tempura really stole the show.    One tempura dish that was horrible however, was the shrimp tempura with orange aioli.  The dish arrived with chopped pieces of shrimp tempura that were absolutely saturated, soaked, and drenched in a deluge of mayonnaise.  Combined with the oil from the deep frying, this dish was nearly sickening.  In terms of the sushi, it was very good but not mind-blowing.  With all the glowing reviews I was expecting to see the heavens to open up and hear angels singing the Hallelujah chorus, but alas that did not happen.  The hamachi was good, as were the salmon skin roll, and the California roll made with real crab.  Unfortunately, the chu toro at $10 was a disappointment.  Normally, chu toro will make me pause and cause my eyes to roll back as I savor each buttery bite.  Not so much this time.    All in all my experienced was mixed, but I'm willing to give them another chance to try their omakase.",

Garlic Hamachi Sashimi - Awesome Ocean Trout Sashimi - Nice n Fatty Tuna Sashimi - Korean Red pepper paste added a different taste  Seared O-Toro  Nigiri - TO DO FOR Garlic Shrimp Nigiri - SO GOOD Salmon Nigri - Bonito and stuff make it oh so good  I dont remember all of the dishes but it was by far the best sushi experience i've had.

As part of the course was a tender filet mignon, black cod and other great sashimi, finished off with a collection of cut sushi. Everything we had was wonderful!

    "text": "Sen of Japan    the neighborhood sushi creme de la creme.  Upon entering you notice the simple and charming decor .  It's the little things I like about this place from the ingress egress, parking , to their soup spoons & table setting presentations. The space itself is nice on the inside. I like how the windows are from floor to ceiling.  The sushi was truly very good. This is a perfect place for a date night away from the strip. It is pricey but you get what you pay for. Not recommended if you are dining on a budget (or any sushi for that matter ) both times being here I noticed the fish was cold and fresh ! The cool thing about this spot is they are open late and have a late night happy hour Mom-Sat 10:30pm-1:30am. Some people prefer to have all of their sushi brought out at once rather than wait for each dish. Not I , says the man who likes cold fish rather than room temp luke warm nigiri. So I like to order a couple of things to come out together however I prefer not to order it all at once. So be prepared to wait 10-15 mins between orders or double up on your orders.   Started with:   Mushroom Miso  If you go to any other spots for sushi and order their house miso soup and try to compare it to the soup at Sen of Japan you will notice the difference of where you are at right away. One word comes to mind. Quality. One big square of Tofu was not what I expected but definitely accepted.   The Veggie Skewer were tasty and we wished the portions weren't so small & The Chicken Skewer was  juicy. I'd say skewers but this is just one skewer I didn't try it bec the portion was so small. (The waitress did let us know of the portion size prior to ordering and was very informative : )  The Sashimi  The Dried garlic on top of my yellow tail sashimi was soo good I'm drooling  just thinking about it .  Next time I come I will be prepared to order 10 of those   The black snapper with the capers was awesome  Fatty Tuna was great  Salmon carpaccio fantastic  All very good . Service was very 5 Stars. Thanks!",

I went late with my boyfriend for a late night dinner and the place wad empty ( should have known right then and there) i ordered a few things and as im eating i swear my waitress disappeared for a good 20 minutes. She didnt even give us soy sauce for our rolls and wasabi. (Screaming orgasm sauce? It was the worst ive ever had) anyhow im waiting there for my refill and no waitress for 20 minutes. The place was empty where was she? So i walk towards thw kitchen and i ask someone cleaning for the waitress and he asks me what do i need. Hahaha i need some SERVICE thats what i needed. I told the guy i wanted my check and as soon as i said that the waitress came to my table 3 times in 5 minutes.   I was looking forward to this place but the service turned me off. We were the only table there but she couldnt even give us refills for 20 minutes and made us walk up to the kitchen guy for a refill and our check.   Until i try again with a different waitress? Its just wasnt worth my money tonight.  ---- so i go again after about a month and a half since ive written the first part of this review. Same problem but much more wait. I took my own bottle of water this time so i wont go thirsty. I ordered a few things first and i added a bowl of rice. When she came i asked for a spoon since their rice got choppy cus it was old (i know this cus im asian and know exactly how rice should be) anyhow rice was fine but i just wanted a spoon to eat it with and no joke it took 15 minutes. There was one table other than mine and there were two servers. By the time she came with the spoon it was too late i got tired from the wait.  It sucks that a place with such good tasting food has such low quality service. Sad tsk tsk.",

It's extremely affordable and the overall quality is excellent.  They don't offer too many nigiri selection (not as much as Yummy Grill and Sushi) but the quality is really fresh and the sushi rice is well flavored.   They have about 8 selections with your standard salmon, tuna, yellowtail, shrimp, etc.   The cut rolls are standard fare  - your spicy salmon, philly, cucumber, eel rolls but are well priced as well at 3-4 bucks.  The star of the happy hour is the miso black cod lettuce wraps.   Do yourself a favor and order at least 2-3 per person.   Everything about it is delicious with the slight salty miso flavor coupled with the nice textural bite from the noodles inside the lettuce.    The salmon carpaccio was also very good - think Yonaka.....delicate and full of flavor.   Overall, Sen's a great happy hour.  I prefer the extensive nigiri selection from Yummy and the delicate flavors from Yonaka better.",

My dad said the sushi dident even because it prepared so well. Plus almost all the items are made in house making it a great place for people with food allergies to know exactly what's in their food.

    "text": "Just to make things clear, I still love Sen of Japan and it will always be my favorite restaurant here in Vegas. The reason for this update is that sadly, I do have to agree with some of the yelpers who have said that customer service was bad here.    My husband and I usually sit at the bar, but sometimes we come in when it is pretty crowded and have no choice but to sit at a table. This was the case during our last visit. No big deal, we are regulars here, so we understand that on some days, if we don't come in around the time that they open, there will be no open seats at the bar.  The problem was that customer service was not great like it usually is for us. I think our waitress was new because I have never seen her before, and most of the staff already knows who we are. She was not very attentive. She took a while to refill our drinks and because she did not check up on us, we had to wait a long time to put in our second round of orders for sushi. Thank god the waiter who knew us stopped by our table to help us! We also noticed that if you order sushi, they service the customers who sit at the bar first, which also explains why we experienced a longer wait time. There was also a family sitting in back of us who was complaining about not getting their food. We wanted to order dessert, but decided not to because we didn't want to spend another 30 minutes (or who knows how long) in the restaurant.   So the bottom line is this: if you want good service, sit at the bar! Get there early or right when they open at 5pm. All the sushi chefs are great, but I think my boy Sonny is the best!!",

    "text": "Sometimes places leave you speechless and it is okay. Sometimes you don't need to drone on and on about how good the food is. Sen of Japan leaves that almost perfect impression on me and it is hard to put it into words.   Starting out with the Hawaiian style edamame is a must. So is the mixed seafood cucumber salad. From that point, it only got better. All of the nigiri was fresh, a generous slice, but could have held back on the dressing. At points, the rice was falling apart due to how much sauce was on some of the pieces.   My friends that I had dined with had prefaced that Sen's miso black cod rivals that of Nobu's. I had to get it and for $14, it is a steal. The steak with the sweet soy based sauce was freaking fantastic. Dragging the meat through it to dab on my rice was not enough. I should have been as smart as my dining partner and just tipped the plate over my rice.   You need to save room for the chocolate souffle with green tea ice cream. It is magnificent. The nice crunch from the shell to the gooey center pairs so well with the homemade ice cream. I died so many times throughout the meal.  I cannot complain about one thing that hit our table. I call that a win with around eight different fishes, a few appetizers, a couple of entrees, and two desserts.",

The rice is well seasoned.  The fish is very fresh.  If they have it, the O-Toro is worth it.  it's the real deal.  All the tempura is all perfectly cooked but are the least authentic of their offerings.  That said, the sea urchin is excellent.  Sumibi-yaki dishes are simple and very tasty.    Standouts from the dinner menu include the yellowtail and salmon with spicy garlic ponzu, the kobe carpaccio, grilled fish collar, the black cod with foie gras, and the fresh deep fried soft shell crab.  All are very creative.  They are all well seasoned and perfect with a cold beer or well chilled sake.  Never had the chance to try the omakase yet but based on the creativity of the chef, I'd guess its excellent.  Service is good.  Prices are on the high side but well worth it to avoid the Strip.",

But after a visit to Sen, I was quickly sucked into the hypnotizing world of sushi. I now come here about once or twice a month with my fiance and it is our jam!  We don't eat shell fish so I can't vouch for those items, but any of their fish sashimi or negiri is amazinggg. So fresh, CLEAN, tasty, delicate and refined. The albacore is my favorite- feels like a pillow puff in my mouth.  The staff is incredible as well. They all have the extensive menus memorized, so attentive and professional. To sum it up, you're getting Nobu quality but better tasting for half the price.",

We also had tuna rolls, and the fish didn't seem too fresh.  We left some on the plate, not tasty at all. Other dishes were still great, will I return again, yes, but not that soon!!!

I've been to this place several times, but after the last trip I had to come tell you all how great it is.  My gf and I were headed to Naked Fish the other night, not because it's our favorite, but because it's where we had our first date so we like to go back once in a while.  We arrived to find an hour wait, which meant goodbye Naked Fish, hello Sen of Japan.  We sat at the bar for the first time and I must tell you, unless you're with a large group, this is the best way to go.  The chefs are so attentive and friendly, it made for a much better experience.  I started with the miso-shittake soup while the gf had the agedashi with japanese eggplant.  Both were nice twists on old favorites.  The spider roll done caterpillar style with avocado and sweet chili sause was so good we had to get another.  I've had a lot of sushi in my life, but the tuna I had there that night was simply the best piece of fish I've ever tasted.  Bottom line - if you're looking to pig out, go somewhere else to an all you can eat.  If you want a wide variety of good food and great service, come here.",

It was pretty busy, and busier than their norm, so the service was lacking, but the sushi was amazing!  Definitely on par with the sushi restaurants on the strip.  I heard before that the owner was the head sushi chef at nobu and it definitely shows.  A lot of the menu items are almost identical to nobu's menu.  But I didn't mind that at all since nobu is my fav!  However, soj goes further outside of the box with their menu.  For sushi lovers I would definitely recommend the shin's special plate.  It was amazing! Delicate, beautiful, fresh pieces of assorted sushi each topped with a special sauce.  I would also recommend the yellowtail and salmon in spicy ponzu sauce.It was beautiful and delicious as well.  We also had the Hawaiian style edamame, too salty for me, uni, not the best I've had, but not the worst!  Spicy tuna handrolls, amazing. Oysters with salsa, amazing. Tempura, really good. And chocolate cake with green tea icecream for dessert, identical to the bento box dessert at nobu!  Overall a great meal, will go back again soon.",

    "text": "The quality of the sushi we had is 100% five stars, however, what drops it from five to two is the overall experience.  It was a Friday night, we did not have reservations and called Sen of Japan to see if they could squeeze us in. The first person that picked up the phone did not speak English that well, asked me to hold and came back on line again five mins later. I inquired about going in for dinner and then she said hold on. At that time an English speaking person got on the phone and said that if we wanted to, we could come in at 7:30 and if there was tables available they would sit us, otherwise put us in the sushi bar. Okay, since the sushi was highly rated we decided to give it at try. This place is in the burbs off the strip and is about a $30 taxi ride each way including tip,  When we arrived, there was no hostess at the area where the counter was so we just sat in the chairs waiting. A man came up to us, looked at us and then sent another person to come to us. She asked if we had reservations and I recognized her voice and told her we had spoken on the phone and she told us to swing in to see what they could do, and she said, oh yeah I remember, please wait. From our view we observed two tables that each sat two people that where empty for 20 minutes. Two workers came in and looked at us as more people where arriving and hoovering around, yet when we inquired about the two empty tables we were ignored.  One employee greeted another employee as she arrived for work with the phrase, \"Welcome to Hell\".  After 45 minutes we sat at the sushi bar and the sushi chef said I will be with you in a minute. 15 mins went by, and we ordered Miso , Edamame, Tempura Sweet Potato, to start. It arrived 20 mins later. after that was finished, we just waiting for his que to order as he was too busy yelling at the other sushi chefs for making mistakes. After being at the Sushi bar for a total of 45 mins, (those two empty tables still empty), we ordered 28 pieces of sushi.  The first order arrived 15 minutes after we ordered and then it started to trickle in a bit faster.  The quality of the sushi is by far some of the best I have had and in my opinion would beat anything in the Bay Area for quality.  However, the overall 3 hour dining experience was not worth it.  The price is reasonable, we spent $180 on the food + $60 for the taxi.  But again, it was perhaps in my opinion the worse managed Japanese restaurant and poorly trained employees I have experienced in my life time.  We won't go back",

The fish was really yummy, but for me, the star of the night was the filet mignon!  Overall, a very nice time . . . I will definitely be back.

They do some interesting specials, I have tried jellyfish with jalapeno  which was good. And if not everyone at the table likes sushi they also have some great chicken and steak dishes. They do happy hour after 10pm and are open until after 1am.   I am extremely picky when it comes to sushi and I dislike most places, but Sen never disappoints. They are nothing like your average neighborhood sushi joint. Don't let the people who have given negative reviews effect you trying this place.",

The smell of the restaurant was perfect not like some sushi places you walk into (The Ka in Henderson was disappointing in that area).   I try to eat sushi at least once a week if not more and this place will be on my \"A\" list of sushi places to go. The variety of custom sauces that are prepared with every dish is excellent. Atmosphere is good, the chefs are very friendly, and whether you have your own favorite custom dish or something recommended I don't think you'll be disappointed.    And yes, these chefs who own the place used to work at Nobu and the sushi restaurant inside Bellagio (can't remember the name).",

    "text": "This is the best sushi place I have been to in vegas, granted I have not been to any outrageous strip places.    First off the fish here is fantastic, I was taking the advice of the 3 chefs and trying nigiri that I thought I didn't like from other times I tried it and I was blown away, \"no no no, you will like it, it's not fishy like you had before it's very fresh, just came in today\".  Everything I ate was on the suggestions of the chefs, except one spicy tuna roll (great) I ate as filler, it was all superb.    Second off the rice was perfect, it has that perfect balance of sticking together just enough until you bite it, when it bursts apart in your mouth.  The seasoning was spot on for me, just sweet enough so you can taste it but not overwhelming.    Third off, THE SERVICE WAS HANDS DOWN THE BEST SERVICE I HAVE HAD IN A SUSHI RESTAURANT.  I always hear about this fantasy world where you have a local sushi bar where you have a relationship with the chef, he gives you the best stuff they have, you trust him to serve you, and you like it.  In reality every time in the past when I have asked what is fresh today I get back, \"It's all fresh\", bull crap!  Well folks I found it, literally everyone i saw at the bar knew the chefs and the chefs knew them.  A regular group came in for a birthday and sat at the bar and said, \"wow\" me and take your time.  Even by the time I left all the chefs knew my name and visa versa.  This place is legit,  I was handed mackerel nigiri that was sauced and had some garnish and he told me \"no soy sauce\".  I mean thats fuking awesome, I am not mad because I don't like being told what or how to eat.  You go to a good sushi bar to have a chef prepare you food, not just for food (make sense?).  In other terms, don't fuk around, he knows more than you do so do what he says, you will thank HIM for it.  Go to this place for fish not rolls.  If you order cal roll and shrimp temp roll and some other roll crap with cream cheese covered in eel and ponzu sauce and dunk it in a bowl of wasabi with a splash of soy sauce this place isn't going to stand out in my opinion.  For that type of thing selection is key as long the fish is pretty good.  The prices here are a little steep to be eating fried cream cheese monstrosities.    Nigiri 5-7  Basic rolls 6-8  Special rolls 12-14",

Started with the yellowtail sashimi, very flavorful, and a great start....then we had sashimi salad with garlic ponzu, it was okay, not an item that stood out...next we had black cod soy, which was a split decision between my love and I... it had a slimey texture for him, while I enjoyed it...i think it had a good balance with the sweetness and the miso...the filet mignon was decent, but I think I'm a bit spoiled with steak, hence I might be an unfair judge, its decent, but not something I'd eat again at this restuarant...the final dish that came out was a dish of assorted nigiri sushi with two pieces of tuna roll at the end... i think out of all the dishes we had, this was the most disasppointing, the wasabi under the fish for the nigiri was a bit too heavy, which would of been okay if it was fresh made wasabi like Kagaya in LA, but it wasn't, therefore it was just a overpowering addition to the sushi..  The fish overall, I would rate it around a 3.5, since good tuna melts in your mouth, and salmon should be sweet without any other additional sauces for flavoring, hence why they only received 3.5 stars for the fish....  FOOD = 3.5 stars FOOD & Service = 4 stars, the chefs were definitely fun to chit chat with...",

The dishes are AUTHENTIC japanese cuisine, made by japanese sushi-dons that have been training for decades. The flavor pairings are unique and distinctly different from any other sushi joint I've been to.  Best sushi I've had in my life--and trust me, I've probably tried over a hundred restaurants all over the world and for the money, this tops them all. I'm sure there are a few hoity-toity places with slightly better atmosphere, but those super high end dishes are triple the price. For the quality of food, this place is priced reasonably well.

    "text": "After reading the reviews here, I was quite excited to go. My experience was probably lackluster at best however.. I'm not exactly a novice to sushi either, having enjoyed the most fresh sashimi from Japan.   I went with my boyfriend on a Saturday night and assuming that it would be quite busy, we made a reservation at 7. When we got there (which was at least 10 minutes before 7), we saw a group of three without a reservation get their seats before us. The more infuriating part is that we had to wait for 15-20 minutes to get a seat even though we had a reservation!! It was pretty priceless to see the faces of the waiters when they realized that they had sat a group without a reservation before us, but they did nothing about it.   The service went downhill from there. It was almost laughable how poor the service was. We had to ask several times to just refill our water once. The wait for each dish was about 30 minutes each, which is absolutely unacceptable in my opinion, especially when you are waiting for sashimi dish that was so small! I have seen better sushi chefs cut bigger, more professional, and fresher pieces of fish that filled a plate 5x bigger than that size in 15 minutes.   As for the food, I will say that it was not horrible but it was not great either. We had cod lettuce wraps (taken off the menu now but they said they still made them) because my boyfriend raved about them. I thought that they were just okay. There was a crunchy topping reminiscent of fish bones that made the whole dish pretty unpleasant...   The other dish we had (which I cannot remember the name exactly because their website does not work..) was tempura with orange slices and mushrooms. I found the combination to be absolutely revolting and hard to swallow. I consider myself to be very open about eating strange foods (i.e. will eat anything), but for a dish that was not even that strange, this was just gross.   Overall, I think this place is extremely overpriced, especially for poor service and just okay food. I think the idea of this restaurant is pretty good but put into action, not so much.",

    "text": "My boyfriend and I visit Vegas at least twice a year.  Last time was a few months ago and we were craving sushi.  Didn't feel like paying exorbitant prices on the strip so we yelped and up came Sen of Japan.   The two of us started out ordering sushi (Nigiri mostly) off the menu and then we decided to switch over to Omakase (This is when you leave it up to the sushi chef as to what he serves you) which was the best decision!!  We didn't want any  food from the kitchen so we had the option of Nigiri or Sashimi and were able to switch it up between courses.   We were served approx 5 pieces of Nigiri or Sashimi for each round and the plates were presented so beautifully with simple and complex flavors (fingerling limes, red wine vinaigrette, yuzu ponzu, etc) .  There was even an order in which to eat the sushi.  Our taste buds experienced something truly magical that night.  We have never had flavor profiles like that and the experience was like nothing else we have experienced.  The fish was also very fresh.    Prices were extremely reasonable!! I'd even say cheap!  This will be a staple on every Vegas Trip.  You locals are so lucky to have this place nearby!",

Chicken on a Stick - fabulous.  The Soft Shell Crab with Spicy Tuna Sushi, Main Lobster Sushi (I don't even see that on their online menu), and Avocado Sushi are probably now my favorite things in the world (in that order).  Oysters were fabulous (and so were those little fruits that were served on the ice with them).  Lamb Chops - Amazing.  Shrimp Tempura - woah.  Grilled Fish collar was melt in your mouth delicious.  Everything else we ate was all out of this world even when I wasn't sure exactly what it was...  The ONLY thing we had that was subpar was the tuna on tuna sushi roll - but that was probably just because it was just a little too tuna-ey.  We also had every desert - The Green Tea Creme Brulee brought a tear to my eye for being so tasty (I LOVE creme brulee).  The long-wait Chocolate Souffle and (Almond) Cake? were totally worth waiting for.  The little ice cream pockets (that come from Hawaii) are delicious.  Service was very friendly and helpful.  They wouldn't stop asking us if we wanted more!  We racked up over a $1,000 bill with LOTS of hot and cold saki and bottles of wine to go around (maybe why I'm a little hazy on the names of all of the delicious dishes I tasted).  Totally worth it.",

    "text": "The Skinny: so-so sushi and incorrectly cut sashimi (2.5) service is shamelessly trying to upcharge you and ignore you when you don't feel like playing along(1) value: given the fact that I've been to Korean sushi joints that served similar product, their outrageous prices do not match the quality of the food. (2)  My hubs and I came here about 2 years ago to sample their Valentine's Day omakase. Although there did appear to be a lot of cooked items, the quality of the food was enough to make us contemplate coming here again last week.  We arrived with a friend for some good eats but were disappointed on many levels.  First of all, the service is highly lacking. Our waitress had the annoying habit of always trying to get us to order more expensive items on the menu. No, we do not want a miniscule bowl of edamame you want to charge $4.50 for when I can get a massive bag of it for less than $2. No, we do not want to order alcoholic drinks. No, we don't want any of your appetizers.  After we kept politely declining her suggestions, she pretty much ignored us until she wanted to us to clear the bill. Which was frustrating because she didn't even bring out a bowl of rice that came with our meager meals. Not to mention that they removed our small plates when our food came out.   Let me tell you, it feels totally ghetto eating out of their massive sashimi bowl because you are likely to drip soy sauce on the other pieces of fish.   Not cool. Not zen. All ghetto. Sorry, but it had to be said.  Enough about the shoddy service. More on the food.  Our friend and I ordered the Sashimi Special Combination ($29.95) while the hubby got the Shin's Special Plate ($19.95).  For $19.95, the only special about Shin's Special Plate is how epic a rip it is. Although beautifully presented, the fish texturally, lack the firmness of really fresh product. The size of the fish on the nigri was also on the thinner side. Although the seasoning of the various fish was varied, the pairing of flavors were only okay in my books. Nothing terribly innovative. And for 7 pieces of nigri, it is very expensive.  The sashimi special combination (sashimi plate, bowl of rice, miso soup) for $29.95 is also very expensive for what it was. The thin slices, the small portion size left me very disappointed. Top it off with fish that wasn't the finest quality (I went on a Thursday - no excuses!), I cannot recommend this dish to anyone.  Overall, it's disappointing because there are very few decent sushi joints in town. But between the shoddy service, the lackluster fish quality and the skimpy portions, this place gets a 2 star.",

Sen of Japan, by far is the best sushi restaurant in Vegas that has a high end taste.",

I took some advice from my fellow yelpers and started out with black cod soy, the fish cut like butter, so tender, not a huge fan of ponzu sauce, but I still enjoyed it. The absolute, most amazing thing I started out with was the garlic yellowtail. When I tell you it was the freshest, most delightful piece of fish I'm not making it up. I have been thinking about it since I left the place.   I have to also give a special shout out to our server, Kayla, who was training, but you would have never been able to tell because she was excellent!! We told her we would let her pick our rolls with the only request of NO cream cheese (who eats cream cheese on sushi)? She picked the most amazing rolls,   Shrimp tempura mango inside Real crab mango cucumber Large wild shrimp tempura with apple and inariage, I know it sounds crazy, but please try this roll! And another one that wasn't on the menu, I believe it was called the ultimate yellowtail. So darn good!   Service here was outstanding! I can't wait to come back!",

The restaurant is about a 15 20 minutes drive from the strip which isn't bad at all if you want delicious sushi! The last times that I've gone I'd never had to wait.

First, it was my birthday and I was running late for my reservation, I called and changed my reservation but they said it was booked but if I come she will see what she can do.  Worried, I decided to take a chance and went.  Within 1 minute she comes back and says \"I have a table, right this way\". I was like what? Did this just happen?  Then I was lucky enough to get the manger to be my waiter and every time I ordered I honestly told him to surprise me.  He brought a few things from the menu and a few from off the menu.  And boy,  nothing disappointed me.  This was the freshest sushi I have ever had in Vegas.  I recommend this place 100%.  Great food great service, great customer service.   I left 5 stars....let's just pretend it's 7 stars!  Go try it! Bon appetit!",

We ordered the veggie combination and was sad when we got one piece of veggie each. I mean, veggies are fairly cheap. We also ordered the Sashimi combination. The fish quality was good, but the cuts were not. They were almost paper thin. A little disappointed with the cuts.  Our waitress was very pleasant. I even asked her a question about the tea and she went and found out and came back with a fun fact for the table. That was awesome. (She gets 5 stars) We also ordered the special shrimp balls, that was delicious. As well as the calamari. That was ok. Little disappointed as we thought we were going to get jalapeno dipping sauce, but rather we just got ponzu instead. :/ We ordered desert, which was delicious... but... we waited 20 minutes for it. It took them longer to do desert than our entire meal! So, that was a little frustrating.  The food was a little overpriced for the amount that you get. We think we will try somewhere else next time.",

I got the orange shrimp because the photos and reviews were so good, it's a tempura shrimp in an orange sauce with few mushrooms and a few mandarin oranges.   Everything was so yummy. I really don't mind paying well for delicious food and I'll be back. I'd be back every night if money wasn't an issue!! For dessert we had mochi and some bubble tea from just a little walk away.

He educated us about the sake and food menus and told us of his favorites and made excellent suggestions. Now sorry to say but I am not a sushi enthusiast, but my Bae told me the quality of the fish was exceptional.   We started our meal with Shishito peppers and black cod with lettuce. Two great choices. My Seafood Toban with the assortment of fish in a delicious sauce was served sizzling. Not a morsel was left on our plates. To top the meal off Rick suggested this delicious warm almond cream puff style pastry with vanilla ice cream. Had to stop myself from licking the plate.   I seriously suggest this restaurant if you have a love of sushi or cooked Japanese food. It truly rivals any place on the strip.",

    "text": "We were in search of an authentic sushi bar where they serve high  quality fresh omasake menu owned by a Japanese sushi chef but knew that none would exist on the vegas strip.  After all, Vegas isn't exactly known for sushi.  I found Sen of Japan on Yelp and noticed their high rating from 60 reviewers and voted as the best sushi restaurant in Vegas by Zagat.   Well, worth the try!!    This place is around 10 minutes away from the Vegas strip.  We sat on the sushi bar and ordered the Omakase.  Our sushi chef's name was Sunny.  I would have to give him 5 stars for excellent service.  He was very attentive and worked quickly to serve not just our dinner but also the orders he had to full fill from other customers.     The sashimi were all nicely plated and were topped with different garish on each fish.  The layout of every dish was so pretty but the taste was even better.  I loved the way they prepared the rice where it was perfectly moist and wet.  Some places gives you a glob of dry rice that ruins the whole experience.    Omasake was $55-$85 per person depending on how much you wanted to eat.  I was full when I reached the $55 mark.  After the last toro fish, I felt content.    LA offers higher quality sushi places but for being Vegas, it was good enough for me to rate them at least 4 stars.    If I were in Vegas again, I'd come back here. If you're sick of all those typical hotel buffets, go try Sen of Japan.  I don't recommend ANY sushi restaurant on the strip.  Those are catered to non asian customers who don't know the difference between sushi or sashimi and are content with previously  frozen fish.",

The salsa on here was great, and made me eat a lot of the greens lol. It was tender Calamari, but the salsa made the dish.  Fried Shrimp with Orange Aioli Sauce!   <a href=\"http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/sen-of-japan-las-vegas?select=HzbNZHaDg795sfCBJa1KoQ#MyNAvct4P6QPxwlJY6thUQ\">yelp.com/biz_photos/sen-...</a>  This was great...shrimp were cooked perfectly, and the sauce (albeit a bit sweet) was flavorful and zesty. This was one of my favorites of the night, although it was a bit sweet for my tastes.. still very enjoyable!  Nigiri is good here :  <a href=\"http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/sen-of-japan-las-vegas?select=HzbNZHaDg795sfCBJa1KoQ#q-S7KeYG7pbq3CxQ_1q3Qg\">yelp.com/biz_photos/sen-...</a>  Fresh cuts of fish, with small amounts of dressing and flavors added...not just plain nigiri.  Edamame was good but very simple :  <a href=\"http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/sen-of-japan-las-vegas?select=HzbNZHaDg795sfCBJa1KoQ#V0zrF8BJUXZJvVY0PtcU3g\">yelp.com/biz_photos/sen-...</a>  The bads   Fresh Water Eel Roll :  <a href=\"http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/sen-of-japan-las-vegas?select=HzbNZHaDg795sfCBJa1KoQ#9B_i1RNUQ6b5lm1alDisJA\">yelp.com/biz_photos/sen-...</a>  This was just ok...the eel was cut fairly thin, so it was hard to find it in there. Rice was a tad overdone, and it was a very forgetful dish. Haven't had mediocre sushi for a while...but that's what this was   Lava Cake with Green Tea ice cream :  <a href=\"http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/sen-of-japan-las-vegas?select=HzbNZHaDg795sfCBJa1KoQ#oHLSH2VlzPaI4XEcZiTbVg\">yelp.com/biz_photos/sen-...</a>  I made the mistake of ordering it after we were done eating, so there was a 15min wait or so...but when I cut into it, no \"lava!\" It was overcooked....and the ice cream wasn't very flavorful either. Huge bummer after waiting for that long....plus, it wasn't on the happy hour menu, so I think it was a solid $7-8 down the tube.  And lastly, the price. I spent almost $40 + tip on a Happy Hour menu with no drinks by myself...and since I wasn't blown away on most of the food, I didn't get the bang for the buck ratio I prefer.  I would have rather went to that new \"fusion\" place and spent half the money, or an AYCE sushi spot and fill up on the good stuff for again...less money.",

    "text": "I dont see what the fuss is over.   So in a city with a sushi restaurant as commonly seen as a Starbucks you would have to be extraordinary to stand apart. With so many reviews of high praises had me highly anticipating this meal, and at the end of it i thought WTF. The dining room isnt anything fancy at all, its actually not even warm or inviting in any way. I can say that service is super attentive, and they are knowledgeable of the menu so a star for that. But when it comes down to the actual food, although it was good it simply wasnt anything that made me want to return. Especially after the $120 bill for 2, when i could have went to any number of spots and eaten for half that and felt the same way after my meal. Having a combination of both the rolls, and their signature sashimi and nigiri with special sauces. Its different of course with combinations like Salmon w/ Orange Miso, or Scallop with Spicy Lime Dressing, but different doesnt always mean better and i think thats True in this case. I read that rolls with mango were a must, and we tried a few of them but id say only one of them really \"worked\" well together. Toward the end of the meal i found myself ordering a final roll in the more traditional offering because all the weird sauces etc didnt do it for me.  If your looking to get away from the more traditional sushi offerings with weird sauces, unique ingredient combos, etc then sure come on by, but expect to drop a decent amount of cash on the bill. But if you enjoy sushi because of the taste, texture and quality of the actual fish and preparation that doesnt taka away from that then go elsewhere. I will not return.",

I highly recommend the cold soba noodles and the salmon carpaccio. The yellowtail nigiri is absolutely delicious and fresh! Their happy hour is really good and super cheap for what they offer; it's from 10:30pm-1:30am. Our waitress was extremely friendly and was great with recommendations and was very accommodating to our needs, very impressed! I will return and recommend to all my friends for sure.",

The rolls that have the chef's specialty sauces are unique and flavorful. I enjoyed the chili lime sauce nigiri that I ordered.  The wait staff was attentive, formal, and informative.

    "text": "Lesson learnt : \"Sauces do make all the difference!\"   And before anything, I'd like to give a shoutout to Veronica and Jo. You guys stupendously rocked! Thank you once again for your delightful company. You have to know that I was stuffed to much contentment, I should probably feel guilty about it. This couple, my fellow yelpers, are buddies from school I've gotten to know better over the months and setting aside any possible bias I have for them, I gotta admit (and you will too if you come here) that Jo is quite the chef!   The night began on a more exotic note: Hawaiian Spicy Edamame, followed by one order of the spider rolls and another of the shrimp tempura rolls. Both were of decent sizes, enough to fill your stomach up halfway. I especially admired that little touch of mango on the spider roll.   And everything only crescendo'd from there. We then had the Calamari with Jalapeno Salt which was 'succulent' - a word I would never have seen myself associate calamari with, fyi - and that's a compliment, because the sauce/topping that was sprinkled on top of each calamari gave it a vinegary taste, a unique alternative to the usual tartar sauce. There was also the mixed seafood with apple vinaigrette although I must swiftly move on to pinpoint the highlight of the night - the Chocolate Souffle with green tea ice-cream. All concerns regarding weight loss and a possible diet regime disappeared as soon as it got to our table, I tell ya! I probably don't even have to go on and speak in awe of this dessert for you to know that Veronica and I loved it to tidbits!   Will definitely keep this restaurant on my list of go-back-tos. It had a cozy atmosphere, dimly lit with candles, perfect for long talks or a cute date night. The staff was very friendly (props to you Kayla) and I couldn't quite forget the lightning tearing up the sky in the background that night - all while we were talking about ghost stories too!   Fancy that.",

I had the \"blue\" vodka drink, it had sliced cucumber in it and a giant blue ice ball. It was stiff and strong.   I let our chef know about my gluten problem and he made sure that all the pieces we ordered were without soy or were made with the gluten-free soy.   We had the octopus with the truffle oil, it was so delicious, it was served with little micro green and red onion.  Then we had the red snapper in truffle oil too, and this was delectable. We also needed to sample the Santa Barbara oysters, these we're oh so fresh, I don't know how they do it.  We also opted for an assortment of sashimi sushi. These we're salmon, tuna, yellow tail and halibut. All incredibly delicious.   We tried some cooked items too, like the hamachi Kama and the live soft shell crab. The hamachi was buttery and oh so meaty and the crab was lightly powdered in corn starch and deep fried. So delicious.   Will be making Sen of Japan a staple.",

He can make great recommendations based on choices you've already made!  I typically like the less additionally flavored sushi. However,  their garlic style for kanpachi and yellowtail nigiri are phenomenal with a hint of spice! The ocean trout with spicy ponzu and the scallop with spicy lime sauce were also very tasty, but had a little bit too much sauce and took away from the fresh fish flavor. I also got the cold soba, which was good, but nothing special; I don't think I'll be ordering that the next time I'm here. I'll definitely have a next time though!",

Coming from the Venetian via Uber, my wife says to me fifteen minutes in, \"Where are you taking me so far away from the strip?\".  \"You'll see\" Is all I said.  Yes, it's a ways from ground zero prime strip but I knew that going in.  Dinner at Nobu would have set us back nearly $500.00.  With the Uber fare and all in at Sen of Japan we got by for about $250.00 for two people.  Half!  We did the 6 Course Omakase for $60.00 per person.  I added Seared Albacore with Enoki Mushroom Garlic Ponzu, and Garlic Shrimp.  It was just the right amount of food for us.  We each got our own plate of each dish.  Course 1 Garlic Yellowtail with Yuzu Soy.  Fresh, delicious!  Course 2 Sashimi Salad w/Capers, Garlic Olive Oil (Tuna, Salmon, and Albacore).  Perfect.  Bring it on.  They slipped in my order of Seared Albacore with Enoki Mushroom Garlic Ponzu.   Yum!  F Yeah! Barvo!  Course 3 Black Cod Soy Get in my belly.  Absolutely addictive.  I'd like 5 more of these tasty morsels please.  Course 4 Filet Mignon Steak Course.  Devine!  Cooked to a perfect medium rare.  Endorphin rush coming on....  Course 5 Sushi Course.  They added my order of Garlic Shrimp to this course for us.  Garlic Shrimp Nigiri was good.  Loved it.    Went for first piece of sushi, record scratch sound effect: <a href=\"/redir?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.youtube.com%2Fwatch%3Fv%3DrJYRW_ZFiOE&s=b1e97df55181c3e27a57bb3eecbaa96393dd3ff149bda2df4be1052aa31e9e64\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">youtube.com/watch?v=rJYR...</a>  Hey, this sushi is cold, premade and refrigerated?  No you didn't!  Fish too cold, rice cold, not warm.  Sushi foul has been committed.  Jiro would not have been pleased.  I was so happy with everything we had before I'm letting it go.  Everything was fresh.  I mentioned it to the waiter and he said the fridge was off by a few degrees.  Not sure why anything was put into a fridge to begin with.  Miso Soup with Clam was great.  I guess this in not considered one of the courses.  Course 6 Molten chocolate cake and Green Tea Ice Cream.  Lovely.  This was the best dinner we had on our 3 night trip.  I would highly recommend this place to anyone looking for a great off strip Japanese restaurant.  The place was great for a nice quiet dinner on a weeknight.",

If sushi is not your thing, they have lots of other options meat, vegetarian and seafood. My go-to would be the black cod - so flavorful.   As for drinks, they offer a variety of sake. I got this really interesting cocktail that comes with a sphere ice cube.   Service is always impeccable and they are so warm!",

Rick was our waiter for the night. The restaurant is so clean and not crowded with tables and chairs. Restroom is very clean, male and female separated.  Our waiter, RICK, recommended the Rick's Omakase (server choose everything for us). Rick choose every single thing we ate and drank. He served us the Wakatake green saki, So refreshing!!! Then he brought us the Soto saki, also cold, a little better on the taste buds.  Rick listened to what we commented on all food and adjusted our menu as needed. We ordered a roll with serrano chiles and the chef placed one piece alone on a plate for my friend. This was done many times to accommodate her weakness for spicy foods. This is the first place I have ever been to and been made to feel like family. The Chef prepared every dish with exactly 6 pieces so everyone one of us tasted a piece. My most fav sushi, besides ALL of them, was the garlic shrimp!! Absolutely loved it here!! Will return and you should make this a must stop if you are ever in the area!!!",

It did the trick but, unfortunately, it didn't leave that impression where I'd want to come back. Rather, I'd be open to trying another place since there are so many in Vegas.",

Got the black cod butter lettuce wraps, shrimp tempura orange aioli, some happy hour rolls, salmon and yellowtail nigiri. And from out of the happy hour menu, we got garlic shrimp and nabeyaki udon.  STICK AWAY FROM THE ROLLS ON THE HAPPY HOUR MENU. There is like no taste, so bad... It's a roll in the simplest definition.  The shrimp tempura was not what I was expecting. It's like some fried shrimp diced up and covered in aioli sauce. Not really tempura....The udon was solid, nothing too special, just your traditional wholesome udon. The salmon and yellowtail nigiri was actually very good value. I would get more of those. The garlic shrimp was actually my favorite. Great flavor, cooked in the style of shrimp nigiri. Kind of reminded me of buttered lobster. The black cod lettuce wrap was delicious though. It's cooked the way you would usually do for sea bass. Steamed and then some miso sauce spread over it.  Didn't think this place was that special, but maybe stick to their special sushi menu.",

I was so spoiled on my date with all this great suggestions hitting all the right spots.  We ordered a lot of food, ok, well he ordered a lot of food but the following were the ones I could remember: Fresh Water Eel with Kiwi on Top Yellowtail \"Garlic Style\"  Filet Tataki Spicy Salmon Salmon with Orange Miso Almond Yuzu Matcha Creme Brulee  Please do not ask me which is my favorite because all of the dishes were  sensational. You could taste the freshness in the fish and the texture. Our waitress did a great job of keeping our table continuously full, checking on our food satisfactory and giving us a heads up about ordering dessert ahead a time because it does take awhile for certain dishes to cook. From appetizers to dessert, I could not say one bad thing about any of the dishes. The presentation while very simple was also eye pleasing and subtle. This spot is a great neighborhood sushi place located across of the dessert breeze park. My date also let me in a great secret: the sushi chef/owner goes to the fish market early in the morning, every morning to get the freshest and best fish he can find. All those fish not sold at the end of the day, is donated. Hats off to the owner of this wonderful establishment for not only delivering a great and quality dish but for giving back to his community.",

Thing I love: Service - I called in for reservation and the hostess asked all the finding questions to ensue they will be prepare for upon our arrival. Our server was engaging and made some good recommendations. Busboy promptly remove empty plates and refill water. The whole front side of the house worked well together to provide an enjoyable evening for my family.  Things I like: House made tofu- it was a medium firm texture tofu served with Bonito flakes, green onion, ginger and soy sauce.  It was refreshing but the portion was a little small. Buckwheat soba cold noodle - I enjoyed the firm texture of the noodle. The sushi rice was well seasoned and with enough amount of vinegar. We order few nigiri and couple rolls all of them tasted fine.  Ribeye sukiyaki- beef was tender with nice beef flavor. The broth was very good, and we drank it all.  We also ordered Nabeyaki Udon, chicken karaage almond souffle. All of them tasted fine no big complaints but not very memorable.  Overall it was a good experience, they comped my son a birthday chocolate souffle and brought him candle.  All the dishes were fine or pretty good but not a single dish wowed me. May be I didn't order the right stuff. Based on this experience I like the place but don't love it.",

We also had the black cod which was very good.  The tempura combination was good, but the batter was a bit dry.  I also had a salad which had a nice dressing.  I would like to try this place again and have more nigiri or sashimi.    The service was good and the bathrooms were clean.  I hear that Andre Agassi and Steffi Graf like this place, so keep your eyes open!",

    "text": "DELICIOUS!! The flavorful dishes of the Sen of Japan shouldn't be missed when visiting Vegas.  Located on the west side of Vegas, a little far for the tourists on the strip.  But well worth the travel.  And if you are a Nobu fan, you've gotta try this place.  Oh, and after eating here, you'll know whey they are Michelin rated!  Highly recommend the $55 Omakase tasting menu.  We must of had 7 different dishes.  The amazing part was that everyone at our table didn't have the tasting menu, yet the food was sync'd between the tasters & non tasters.  We all had food at the same time, so people weren't waiting around. The tasting menu was just delicious.  Visually stunning and delicious.  If you have the tasting menu, you have to tell the waitress how many times you had it before.  This way, they can change the menu for you.  Apparently, they have 4 tasting menus. After the 4th trip, then its chef's choice.  Sen of Japan was so good, we went twice in a weekend!",

So I got a seat at the sushi bar was was served by the owner (I found that out later).    I started with the mussels with garlic butter hot appetizer which was the best mussels that I have ever had!  I slurped up the sauce when I was done because it was that good.  I then had tempura shrimp and avocado off the a la carte menu--hot and delicious.  The sushi was the best that I've had in awhile.  I've been to plenty of place in California and his sushi was up with the best of them.  The only thing that he didn't have was live scallop.  The eel was cooked to order--not already cooked like lots of other places.  He made me a really good shrimp with garlic butter and mushrooms--OMG--it tasted like lobster--I highly recommend it.  The Kanpachi was also really good.  The Uni was fresh.  I had the yellowtail sashimi with the jalapenos and fried garlic that you see in the photo section--mighty tasty.  Oh, one more unique sushi was the albacore with pepper from Japan--damn that was good.  This whole meal went down with some awesome sake (I forgot the name) that the owner recommended.    I actually went to Raku the following night which I was a little disappointed by.  I should have come back here instead to try some of the rolls and more cooked items.  Oh, well.  All I know now is that when I'm in Vegas from now on, I'll be hitting up this place again.  It was only about 15 minutes from the strip.",

We went here directly after our 30 min wedding and had one of the best meals we had ever eaten. The wait staff and sushi chefs were extremely knowledgeable and nice. They helped us decide on a wonderful sake. We love sushi, but we wanted to try something new, so we ended up choosing the \"Omakase Special,\" which for $55 a person gives you two chef-chosen plates from the sushi menu, two from the kitchen, and another from the sushi menu, followed by dessert. It was simply amazing what the chef was able to put together for us on a Wednesday evening at 9:00 PM with no notice or reservation. It was simply the best sashimi I have ever had and the most creative, given the selection of fish available that night. The chef even apologized as we walked out, \"Sorry, it was all I could do. I wish I could have done more!\" I wish there was a place like this in Indiana! Also, the place is perfect for those who want to escape the strip. It's about a $30 cab fare from the mid-strip, but it's well-worth it.",

We stopped in on a Sunday night, only a few other groups dining so we were seated right away. We started with some edamame and the yellowtail appetizer, which was recommended by our server and was fantastic. The rest of the meal, though, was pretty underwhelming. We ordered a bunch of sushi rolls to share, so I can't speak in regards to any of their other entrees, and while they were all good, they weren't anything special. Perhaps my expectations were set high from all the great reviews, and its disappointing that I can't give it a great review as well, but I (and the rest of my party agreed) was not too impressed. Service was good though, only mishap was one forgotten roll that we had to remind our server about.",

The decor is nice (nothing CRAZY over the top but nice). The guys at the sushi bar were so fun and helpful in ordering rolls and I have to say each roll we ordered had 6 big pieces...I started to get full after 4 pieces. THe beer was cold and the way they set up the sake and serve it is FUN! The service happened so fast and elegantly that every time we looked down we had fresh plates and new ice cold beer glasses and yet we were never interupted once! We never had to look up and ask for anything! Just because the sushi chef is from Nobu doesn't mean this place has to be exaclty like Nobu. They are obviously getting a good following becasue on a Saturday night it was filling up. The T.V. at the sushi bar is fun for sporting events if you are just going to grab some sushi with a friend or with your boyfriend etc., etc. And it is a great place to take people that don't eat sushi because they have an entire menu of cooked food. My suggestion is GO! The service, sushi, ambiance, and prices are definatley worht it! Especially in these tough times when a lot of places have either closed or they quality of the food has gone WAY down!",

The fish was flavorful and fresh and the jalapenos provided a good amount of heat. The onion and sweet potato tempura was good but nothing special. The spicy tuna roll wasn't that great -- possibly too much mayo and not enough tuna in the mix. The unagi with kiwi and mango had a distinct sweetness to it which was refreshing and unique but the eel may have been overcooked. The staff was friendly and knowledgeable and they were incredibly quick to pick up dishes when we were done. The atmosphere was nice and cozy, esp. because they sat us right next to the only other party in the restaurant leaving the rest of the place completely empty. I dunno... I think I would have preferred a little personal space. I expected to be blown away by the food since the exec chef trained under Matsuhisa. But the whole experience was underwhelming. Other items on the menu sounded great so this place might be worth another try.",

There are better place to go eat for us. For example, I can go to Suncoast Oyster Bar and get much better spider roll for a cheaper price.  For a little more money, we can just go eat at Hachi at Red Rock which has better roll and service.",

The first sign all was not well was the presentation of the yellowtail with garlic. In the past, it was a tiny, firm filet bite artfully presented with a swirl of sauce. Last night, it was a fish blob in a brown puddle.  Then, my husband and I ordered wine. We each ordered a different white by the glass, which the waiter brought to our table in small carafes and poured. As is our habit, we tasted each other' s wine, and we were  shocked to discover we had been given the same thing. When we informed our waiter, he brought over an already open bottle and poured from it, proving absolutely nothing. It, too, was the same! We should have required two bottles to be uncorked in front of us, but Instead of making a further to do ....we continued with our meal. Soft shell crab was good, some sushi was fine, but one roll, a simple California roll, was not edible. The only reason I give them stars at all, after feeling defrauded, is the service, which is impeccable. Always before, this was our go to sushi place. Hope whatever was going on last night gets fixed.",

The chefs have always been kind, proficient, and wonderful to speak to when sitting at the sushi bar.  We were given a 15% discount card after a few of our visits for being locals and regulars.  Unfortunately, the quality of the service has greatly declined in the past year.  During previous visits we always received our food quickly, our table was cleared after we completed each course, our drinks rarely reached the half-full point, and we promptly received our bill when finished with our meal.  The opposite has been True for each of my last three visits and especially bad during the final one, in which a tempura dish was repeatedly forgotten despite reminders.  It also took over thirty minutes for us to receive our bill.  As much as I love Sen, and despite the memories and significance it holds for  my husband and I, we will not be returning.  The cost of a meal is too great for us to be treated poorly by our server.  Should you choose Sen of Japan for your meal, please make sure you leave plenty of time in order to deal with the tail-end wait.",

    "text": "So - this place is about a 10-15 min cab ride from the strip (which = about  $20 + tip). Some background:  We are big sushi fans and regularly try to find great sushi places after her trip to Japan.  I in a previous life, used to manage a great japanese restaurant and worked with authentic Japanese chefs for a while. I've eaten at high-end japanese restaurants in many different cities (Nobu, Hiro, Masa, etc....).  Summary: Go!  This is te best sushi and japanese cuisine I've had anywhere.  This is not the typical sushi joint, nor is the typical high-end japanese restaurant, it is low-key - with a focus on great food.  Our Server John also became my second favourite server in the world (yes - the world!).  The Hot kitchen chef is previously from Nobu.   Pricing is entirely reasonable and cheap compared to the strip.  Spend the taxi fare to get here and rationalize it like this:  Nobu on the strip for a similar meal would be around $400 or so...here it is $150 (incl $60 bottle of Sake).    The restaurant decor is certainly nothing like Nobu, but is clean and relatively modern and is perfectly fine for a nice date - but if you impress people based on fancy decor rather than taste - you're going to the wrong place by coming here (I agree with previous reviewer: the TV is out of place behind the sushi bar).  Details: John is an awesome, friendly server with great background knowledge who also suggested a great bottle of Daiginjo style cold Sake.  We didn't go Omakase, but John was our guide to the menu that night - based on our preferences he suggested several dishes that all ended up being delicious.  Tempura was great - not too greasy, good amount of batter. Sushi - each had it's own\"secret\" sauce...great pairing. Fish - all very fresh.  O-Toro was superb (unlike previous comments), yellowtail was very good (had red flesh elements), maguro had an interesting twist of Jalapeno pepper and a fried garlic chip (ummm!).  Also they had several selections of fish/cuts that aren't available or on the menu of most restaurants (awabi, Kanpachi, Chu-Toro, O-toro...etc) Entree - The Black Cod Miso dish with Foie gras was rated very highly by my foie-gras-mad-girlfriend.  Makis - Great selection, and the curry spiced shrimp tempura was delish.  Most other sushi places have something like 12 ingredients they are working from to create \"new\" makis (ie: cucumber, lettuce, mayo, spicy  sauce, eel sauce, tempura bits, and some other ingredients)....resulting in some unsurprising variations in their rolls.  Sen of Japan must have something like 30+ ingredients they use to mix it up....resulting in some tasty and interesting flavour combos.  (ie: japanese curry + red onions + tuna+ tempura shrimp).  I've never written as effusive of a yelp review before, but that's really because I haven't had this good of a japanese meal in a while...so it is well deserved.  We had already decided we will be going back whenever we're back in Vegas before we left the restaurant!  Screw Nobu, Wazuzu, etc.  They are overpriced and the fish isn't even THAT great there (had some so-so tuna and toro).  Spend your evening at an off-the-strip place and get some serenity....  ALSO - Call a cab about 20 mins before you want to head back into town....or ask the cabbie who drops you off for his phone number.",

But the quality of the food - in this case their sushi - is not on the same level.   I've been to Nobu and Matsuhisa. I can see that Sen of Japan tries to emulate these gems, unfortunately they can only go as far as the list on the menu. Words such as foi gras or truffles don't impress me much if the simplest dish can't even be prepared decently.  During my visit, the fish was fresh but the sushi rice, the base of the word \"Sushi\" itself, can't even go unnoticed as being a decent or even standard. The rice was dry, it fell apart even as you tried to lift the nigiri or the rolls. Barely tasted the sweet vinegar infused in the grain, the rice was rather chewy, a bit like sweet rice (sticky rice).    The fish slices are quite thin. I thought with sushi you suppose to eat and taste the flavor of the fish, with rice as accompaniment not the other way around??  As usual I ordered a spicy tuna handroll - to see how they manage spiciness with fresh fish. I always give credit for trying to be creative, but only praise when the creativity was done right. A handroll is a handroll. Its shape is a basic cone and people usually put their creativity in its presentation. I just don't get it when I saw the handroll that looked like a sushi roll gone wrong. Perhaps by mistake they made a mini sushi roll and then realized that the order was actually for a handroll? It was a flatten cylindrical shape with a small piece of rectangular seaweed to cap the bottom of the roll. 2 pieces of seaweed to make a handroll alone already rolled my eyes. Top that with soggy seaweed, a handroll that looks like a patch-up job, spicy tuna that's so salty I could not taste the fish at all, can't even see the fish as well for it was so finely mashed the mixture was a pretty color of pink. The prominent taste was only that of the mayo and chili sauce. The tuna/mayo paste was very soft, the little patch of seaweed that plug the end of the roll could not contain it.  Agedashi tofu, the deep fried slightly battered tofu, took so long to come out. It supposed to be an appetizer, but it came out at the end of the meal, despite our inquiry to the waitress (twice). When it came, the batter was so thick and hard it was rather tough to puncture with the chopstick. I was expecting a silken texture of the tofu, instead I got a rough hard tofu that not just crack under my chopsticks, it tasted dry and tasteless. Not a good texture to feel on your tongue,   Do I dare order anything else after that? I think not... So, 2 stars. One for the place and one for the people.",

I hold food at a high regard, up until now I could say I have not had a decent meal in this town in the past 2.5 years that I have lived here.  Up until visiting this great place.  The chef is not afraid to try new sauces and go for something bold.  You have to try it to understand, don't tell the chef what you want, let him surprise you.   You wont regret it!  30% of my scoring is service, NO RESTAURANTS in Las Vegas has had acceptable service and I have tried many of them.  They always interrupt your conversations or treat you like the food they throw out after they close.  Treating your clients like they are a pain in the ass is not what I call good service.    This place has SF level service and is very attentive.",

Nice local place away from the strip. So many wonderful types of fish you often can only find in Hawaii or Japan. My Sushi chef Sean said to just trust him so I set the menu aside, he made the sushi a couple pieces at a time. I took my time, really taking in every note of the flavors. Every piece tasted uniquely like no other sushi I have ever had to date. All simple, delicate, artful, refined but with unique clever twists and ornate presentation. It is easily the freshest fish I have ever tasted outside of Maui, Honolulu or Tokyo. I am honestly speechless! If I had a last meal this would be it. Go here and don't ask any more questions. Set aside everything you know about sushi, sit down at the sushi bar and just put your hands and tatsebuds in the hand of a wonderful chef. Stray from what you think you already know, try something new and you will NOT be disappointed!",

I would feel comfortable putting this as the best sushi restaurant I have ever been to.  On top of that, the prices were quite reasonable.  We started off the dinner with a nice warm towel, followed up by some edamame for an appetizer.  We then had two rolls and two deserts that were all amazing.  The moshi ice cream was amazing (strawberry, chocolate/peanut butter, and tiramasu) and the chocolate suffle with green tea ice cream was to do for.  Simply put, this place rocks!",

Go with a big group and give this place as much business as you can.  It deserves it and you will all have a blast getting loaded up on the saki and the meal, whoah.  Wonderous.  And here is a tip, if you went to Vegas and forgot to make reservations for a place to have a good meal, just come here.

The servers are very knowledgeable with the menu and are always so cheerful. :) My drink is always refilled promptly and I am checked up on to make sure all is well at the table  but never to the point of being overbearing.  The food is absolutely AMAZING. This is why I continue to come back aside from the great service.  The food is consistently good. I think the food is so unique with the raw fish having garnishes and sauces created by Chef Shinji and the kitchen food is great and I feel that I cannot get the same kind of food anywhere else. These are my favorites: 1. The mushroom salad is so delicious. There is a variety of mushrooms sauteed in butter and yuzu.  2. Nebayaki Udon. I love the broth and the egg is cooked so perfectly; I can't get over it! I love the bean curd and the portion of the vegetables as well in this scrumptious soup.  3. Black cod lettuce wraps. I love the way the black cod is marinated. I know other places have miso black cod but the one here definitely has the most unique marinade and goes great with the kataiffi in a small snack sized bite in the piece of butter lettuce.  4. Scallop with spicy lime nigiri. I am not the biggest fan of raw scallops but the combination of the red onions, micro cilantro, and the spicy lime dressing make the raw scallops taste so great. This is a must try if you come here! 5. Salmon spicy style nigiri. The salmon literally melts in your mouth. The bonito flakes and the spicy ponzu sauce is a well thought out combination.  6. The home made chocolate souffle!!!!! By default it comes with home made green tea ice cream which my wife really loves,  however I enjoy it with the home made vanilla bean ice cream. The chocolate souffle is perfect for the chocolate lovers like myself. It takes around 15 minutes or so for it to prepare but it is absolutely worth it!  These are my favorites but there has not been a single dish that I have not enjoyed here. Lotus shrimp is also a great piece created by Chef Shinji. :)  I have not tried that many rolls because I always want to save room for more food,  but as far as I have tried I really love the #19 roll, which is the yellowtail and yellowtail roll with yuzu soy. I plan to come back another time and try the spicy salmon tacos created by Chef Jae. HAPPY EATING :D",

We chose to have the chef serve us whatever he likes. He served us many standard rolls, raw pieces with amazing sauces on them and lots of different types of cooked fish.

The waitress that served us was very knowledgable about the menu items, and she said she has built up that knowledge from the fairly long length of time she has been working at Sen of Japan.  And from the thoughtful way she is able to recommend items on the menu for us to try, to knowing what additional ingredients that are served in each item (not mentioned anywhere in the menu description), you can tell she is a top notch gourmet restaurant waitperson.  But with the HH pricing Monday - Saturday from 10:30pm to 1:30am, you can order enough food to satisfy your stomach and still leave with a reasonable tab.  The Fresh Salmon Carpaccio Style is absolutely a must try.  It is sliced thin and seared quickly and served with a sesame ponzu sauce garnished with fried mizuna.  The Black Cod with Butter Lettuce Wrap was also very excellent.  The Red Snapper Nigiri was very fresh and tasty.  The Sweet Balsamic Chicken sounds interesting, but I felt the sweet soy sauce overpowered the balsamic reduction, and rendered it almost like your average teriyaki chicken.  Except the chicken was cooked perfectly, and it would have made an excellent Chicken Teriyaki at any Japanese restaurant.  The Fried Shrimp with Orange Aioli was good. But the most interesting part of the dish is the Orange Aioli, which gets its heat from Sambal Oleke, and would undoubtedly make an excellent dipping sauce with perfectly fried calamaris.  This restaurant is perfect for a special date or an excuse to treat yourself.  Come for the HH to explore the menu, and return to check out more items that are sure to please your palette.",

They will bring an ice sphere made of frozen green tea; as the ice freezes the tea particles gather in the bottom of the sphere and they rotate this green part of the sphere so it's at the top of the sphere in your glass and it looks like an eyeball.  Very cool and adds flavor to what you are drinking as the ice melts.",

Who the fuck would have thought, this tiny little place west of the strip would have some incredible fish?  So surprised, and now I'm converted from naked fish. Dollar for dollar, best sushi I've ever had. From the sashimi/nigiri to the innovative rolls, it was an awesome dining experience that I'm excited to have again and again and again.  Black snapper, that's all I have to say.  Trust me, I'm a doctor.",

    "text": "We came here for a birthday dinner, and overall, it was disappointing. Just say NO-to omakase. It's a rip-off. Nothing was really special or unusual. Most items were from the menu.  The best thing out of several courses was the black cod, and although the fish was stellar, the fois gras was a bit chewy.   The filet was lackluster, lobster came with a strange sauce, and nothing really stood out. One of the courses was a sushi platter with a plain tuna roll. Seriously? The fish was sliced incredibly thin and narrowly.   I could have put that dessert together with stuff from Trader Joe's.   Normally, I care much more about food than ambiance, but I do not like the vibe here at all. It is not welcoming/comfortable/elegant/unique, and the giant tv behind the sushi bar is seriously annoying. The chef was very professional, but seemed insincere. Our servers were great, though.  **UPDATE** I was just contacted and questioned about my review. \"Were you on drugs?\" No, but I wish I were, as it might have been a better experience!  I grew up in SF and had my first sushi in grade school. I've enjoyed amazing and horrible meals in dives and 5-stars, food carts and Michelin-rated restaurants all over the world.   I am not questioning the quality of the fish. I just thought that the idea of omakase is to get something special that is NOT on the menu, and a tuna roll as a course is a sad joke...  I was actually depressed for a few days after this let-down. I was expecting the Per Se of sushi. For almost $300 for two people, I should have been floating on air after the meal. Instead, I was deflated.  Don't believe the hype...  Cheers~",

    "text": "What sets Sen of Japan apart from Momo Sushi, I Love Sushi, Sushi Fever, and hm, all other sushi places I absolutely love in Vegas, is its crunch.  Momo offers a yellowtail sashimi dish with cilantro, jalepeno and soy/citrus ponzu, but Sen adds a crispy little garlic piece on top. I'll pay the extra 75 cents for that type of perfection. As another example, Sen makes the traditional spider roll but theirs is skinnier. You can order it with spicy tuna on top (number 23 on the menu). What's special is that the spicy tuna doesn't overpower the spider and, again, the spider has a little extra crunch-- carrot --that sets it apart from all other spicy spiders.   Plus, Sen offers much more than sushi. The filet mignon tataki was an unusual treat. The citrusy soy sauce on top the thinly sliced, perfectly undercooked beef made me feel less guilty than I should have with that dish. The flavors were all very well-balanced (just like my Riesling!). We also tried the yellowtail tar tar, which you mix at the table with a little caviar and a wasabi soy sorbet.   Top all that off with great service and I think Sen of Japan is my new favorite restaurant in town.  With two glasses of wine, 1 large Sapporo, and about 4 really outstanding dishes, our bill came to $85 without tip. So Sen is a bit pricier than all my other favorite spots, but it's worth it.",

    "text": "I have a rule of thumb when it comes to passing final judgement on an Indian restaurant: the quality of food should be based on their a la carte dinner entrees rather than their buffet since the drop-off between the two can often be quite steep.  I believe there is a Japanese restaurant corollary in that one should judge the quality of food based on their omakase (tasting menu designated by the chef) rather than their a la carte menu items.  Of course, there is usually a hike in price in both cases but sometimes you pay for what you get, and what you get here for omakase is definitely money well spent.  One would never guess that tucked away in SW suburbia lies a restaurant opened by Hiro Nakano, the former head chef of Nobu (Hard Rock Casino) and was listed in the 2009 Michelin guide.  I met up with some work colleagues and since my boss was treating the group, we decided to indulge in the $55 omakase experience (an $85 option was available, but one should not test the limits of generosity when being treated to a complimentary meal by your superior).  Probably the most interesting question I have ever encountered when deciding on the omakase was being prompted by the server as to how many times I have had the omakase specifically at their restaurant.  Apparently the chef likes to vary the dishes so as to create a different experience for the diner much like a video game character advancing to higher levels of play!  Apparently the variations can go up to \"level 5\" and possibly beyond so I found this to be a ingenious incentive to return for repeat tasting adventures.  A couple members of our party were second-timers so it was cool to get a preview as to what I would be expecting after my first omakase here.  I'm sure the chef would be more than willing to mix and match specific items since the theme to this idea is thoughtfulness towards the customer.  Items I could recollect along with occasional sidenotes with regard to the level 2 menu.  1) Hawaiian yellowtail marinated with yuzu soy:  unctuous and refreshing with bright notes of citrus from the yuzu, very nice start to the meal (level 2 was japanese red snapper)  2) Sashimi salad- delicate slices of assorted fish mixed with shredded daikon and greens in a subtle onion vinaigrette--very clean flavors  3) Miso Black cod with grilled shishito pepper- perfectly cooked and well seasoned, the fish pretty much melts in your mouth and goes well with a nice salty crunch from the pepper (I think in the $85 omakase, this dish is accompanied with grilled fois gras....talk about umami overload!)  4)  Sliced filet mignon served with grilled asparagus-  found this one to be slightly underwhelming since while being cooked medium rare, was a bit under-seasoned and would have liked some asian flavors to be incorporated (the second-timers received a similar cut but was topped with a spicy chili sauce so I'm thinking that version was tastier)  5) Miso soup with wakame (firm seaweed) and mini button mushrooms-  the cute little mushrooms are not only tasty but also provide an artistic glow to the otherwise cloudy earth-tone broth.   6) Nigiri assortment- fairly standard with a couple tuna sushi rolls, one regular shrimp and mackerel nigiri, and pairs of salmon and tuna nigiri....nothing mind-blowing, but helps to fill you up with the added load of rice.  7) Chocolate souffle with green tea ice cream-  nice way to round out the meal.  Souffle could have been more fluffy, but definitely a unexpectedly pleasant flavor combination with the green tea ice cream...I got a chance to taste the almond frangipane cake with pineapple sorbet in the second timers dessert course and that was equally exquisite.  I'm thinking I may have omitted one more sashimi course, but as one can see, this is quite a spread for $55 and I definitely did not go home hungry.  Folks residing in this part of town should definitely take advantage of having such a fine dining option nearby and for those trekking from across town, definitely a nice introduction to omakase at a reasonable price with opportunities to \"level-up\" with subsequent visits.  Be sure to also take advantage of their excellent sake selection.",

Order a sashimi free-for-all and he will whip up some of the best tasting naked-fish-on-a-platter-nibblets combined with the flavoriest (my word, not yet in the dictionary) garnishes you'll ever nomnom.

    "text": "Sen is an interesting spot.  It's Japanese restaurant, fusion-type decor, and Las Vegas sports betting all mixed into one.  Let me explain.  So, the Japanese part is easy - hot towel when you walk in, Japanese food on the menu, and a sushi bar in the corner.  The decor had some other themes to it and was somewhat of an eclectic selection from the candle holders to the wall art.  Now, the sports bar?  I've never seen a Japanese restaurant with a big screen TV behind the sushi chefs with the popular football game of the night on.  So I was here to take The Wife on a long-overdue date since our son has been an incredible beast lately.  Honestly, raising the next generation of Yelpers is tough, especially when they share your \"pizzazz.\"  So we came for a quite dinner for The Wife's favorite, Japanese food.  The softshell crab roll she got was unremarkable.  There's only so much spicy tuna, ponzu sauce, and sriracha that people can experiment with to come up with the next \"creative\" sushi.  I'm a traditionalist - give me normal nigiri or sashimi and be done with it.  I had the chirashi and was disappointed - the chirashi at Tachibana in McLean had more fish and better variety for a \"special\" box than they had at Sen.  I felt like I had wasted my money.  Also, our server acted like she was high the entire time - and I'm talking baked on the good stuff since she didn't seem to connect sentences properly and would look at some ghost behind me through droopy eyes when we spoke.  No thanks, I'll go back to Raku.",

They have several rolls with mango, kiwi and I think another fruit and they're all incredible. Really inventive and original rolls that are just fantastic. Plum wine was delicious and strong. Service has always been good and professional. Never had to wait more than 5 minutes, even at peak times. Restaurant always clean, with fancy touches.  Cons: Definitely a high end sushi place, kind of pricey but worth it. No all you can eat option. No happy hour that I know of. Only open for dinner.

But for some reason we decided to try something different and headed all the way out to Summerlin instead.  When we arrived, around 12:30 a.m., it was completely dead inside save for one couple at the bar. At this hour, Goyemon would be packed to the rafters. Nevertheless, we apprehensively sat down and were quickly greeted and supplied with our Diet Coke fix. Then we immediately set about reading the Reverse Happy Hour menu that Misti and so many other reviewers have raved about.  First, we got the salmon carpaccio, and it was perfect, with a delicious glaze and a taste of freshness. We proceeded with a Lisa Lisa roll (shrimp tempura, avocado, crunch) which was good and a nice change of pace from the same Goyemon rolls we have every week.  For our fourth dish, we wanted to try the shrimp with a lemon sauce. Our waitress told us that the lemon had been abandoned and that the dish now came with a ginger chili paste.  That was a good call. That dish was damn delicious.  Lastly, we tried an Alaska roll, and were disappointed in the freshness of the salmon. After being pleasantly surprised at how fresh everything else was, the Alaska roll left a literal bad taste in our mouths.  Sen is good. Not great, but good. Even the mighty Mon empire has an occasional misstep so I can forgive the Alaska roll...this time. We'll be back and hope that everything was as good as before!",

Sen combines sushi (extraordinary fish) with a bistro - which we didn't sample - but it's nice to know it's there.  No foie gras during our visit.  From the 'usual' starter, hamachi sashimi, the chef suggested a special digression nearly transparent yellowtail, dressed with razor-sliced chili pepper, garlic flake and cilantro leaf, I was on a 'journey' directed by our chef.  Maguro tuna followed for grounding, then 'house smoked salmon' with remarkable subtlety and texture.  Aji (horse mackerel), hotate (scallop) and hirame (fluke) with special dressings spared the wasabe and soy dipping action.  Inventive, thoughtful and humble describes the sushi chef demeanor at Sen.  No broad-stroke arrogance to a \"gaigin\" lacking knowledge.  Having scoured the streets of Tokyo, Osaka and other cities in Japan for over 30 years, the attitude detector is sensitive.  I'm pleased to recommend Sen for both taste and value.  Not at all an AYCE spot, but their unwritten policy of \"no gouging\" is appreciated.  You won't be disappointed.

We actually ended up sitting next to a guy who asked, ohh like can I get like a yellowtail hamachi sushi nigiri roll? Then tried to brag to his date about how he lovvves sushi. People who get rolls do not love sushi, they love mayonnaise.   Get the Omakase and you will NOT be disappointed. I am not a purist and I actually like when they mix non sushi items with the omakase, this place even includes steak and dessert! and its suuuuper cheap for all that you get and believe me you will be stuffed.   Sushi was SUPER fresh, and our AWESOME sushi chef, who I swear is a part time comedian cuz he was hiliariousss even threw in some free pieces.. tried flounder sushi with truffles. ZOMGGG delicioso!

Waitress finally comes, takes my drink order, brings my drink, takes my order, and leaves me with no napkin, chopsticks, soy sauce, etc.    While I was waiting, a couple came in and waited fifteen minutes to get a menu and be told, \"Kitchen closes in fifteen minutes so last call is in five minutes.\"  The food is well-prepared, the late-night happy hour is a great deal, but for what?  To sit around for half an hour for your appetizer?  The poor girl was so swamped since she \"HAD\" to cut a server at midnight so it was just her lone self running around, taking care of nine different orders.  It took fifteen minutes for my beverage and she completely forgot my edamame.  This isn't anything new, though.  Usually I sit at the bar and eat sushi and service is okay because I have the chefs in front of me.  But sitting at a table?  Forget it.  Service was just terrible.  Never again.  No more late night Sen of Japan.  EDIT: ALSO!  Be forewarned that this place may just randomly close at will.

    "text": "Yikes! Reading the other reviews here, I'm wondering if everyone else went to the same restaurant I did! Unfortunately, I have to go strongly against the grain:  Sen of Japan was an incredibly poor experience.  There were early warning signs. First off, our waiter couldn't even pronounce the Japanese fish names correctly. Then, on the menu, kanpachi was listed as \"baby king mackerel\" (see picture). These should have been big red flags that Sen of Japan isn't a passable sushi joint; nevertheless, we continued on. Let's just say we gave them a few mulligans.  Those mulligans were proven undeserved when our orders of the otoro sushi were a disaster. When we picked up the sushi with our chopsticks, the rice literally fell apart. Not a single person in my party - and we're all very experienced sushi eaters and chopstick users -  was able to pick up the otoro and eat it before it disintegrated. Want a picture of the most epic fail (that barely made it two inches above the plate before crashing and burning)? See attached. Ya, I'm not exaggerating. Seeing otoro like that brings a tear to my eye.  Worse yet, the chef loves drenching everything in sauce with totally overpowering flavors (the waiter touted the nigiri with sauce as the chef \"specialty\"). I just don't understand it. Nigiri is something that should implicitly taste good. It's not something that anyone should need to cover up with other flavors in order to be edible. When a chef puts toppings/sauce on nigiri, the goal should be to complement the existing flavor or possibly even evoke a new perspective or understanding of the central ingredient - not completely overwhelm it.  Unfortunately, at Sen of Japan, overwhelm the fish is exactly what the chef does. I could barely make out the salmon underneath all that heavy citrus fruit flavor from the orange miso sauce. It was horrifying. And the sauces aren't even tailor made for specific nigiri. The waiter offered either an orange miso or a spicy sauce with the salmon, and told us we could get those sauces on other sushi too. I honestly felt like we should have been at McDonald's dunking our nigiri like Chicken McNuggets in those sauce packs.  The chef takes the same approach to the sumibiyaki. No matter what we ordered - and we got the chicken, shrimp, squid, and scallop - the skewer is absolutely drenched in sauce. Very disappointing.  Service was also quite poor. Refills on tea and water were far and few in between. Waiter disappeared for a long time with our credit card when we were trying to pay. Also, a waitress got a huge attitude when another party member asked her where they source their duck meat, responding sarcastically \"I don't know, is there somewhere it should be from?\" We were all taken aback, and have no idea why that was an offensive question to her. (Speaking of the duck tataki, I'd recommend skipping it; it tasted more like hickory-smoked BBQ pork than duck.) Finally, they also charged us for fresh wasabi. It's not even in the point-of-sale system, as evidenced on our bill - they just tacked it on as an additional charge. C'mon, I think we ordered enough food that you don't need to nickel and dime us.  All in all, Sen of Japan fails because it is neither a passable Japanese restaurant nor a passable fusion restaurant, and the service is bad to boot. The dishes we tried had at best a vaguely Japanese vibe, and even the chef's 'specialty' item - nigiri drenched in overpowering sauce - is utterly lacking in execution.",

Hence, I didn't get to look at the menu and see the choices (or the prices).  However, I did notice how wonderfully attentive our server was, managing everything beautifully, even with our party of 10. She was patient, friendly, and accommodating (even taking pictures of our group for us).  All of the food I sampled was very good. Since I didn't see the menu, I can't name many things, but there was a mushroom dish that was fantastic, the scallop roll was good, yet very mild. The tempora was tasty, and there was a steak dish that was delicious!   I would definitely return to Sen of Japan on another occasion, and next time, I will be able to actually see the menu!",

SOJ has a nice ambience.. definitely a step up from a typical neighborhood sushi joint.. Dim-lighting, soft music and wooden floors.. It was a little warm at first at our table but it eventually cooled down..   We ordered : Sashimi Salad: Fresh cuts of fish & I liked the capers in the salad Soft Shell Crab Roll topped with Spicy Tuna: The spicy tuna really stood out in taste and appearance.. you could just tell it was very good quality.. Foie Gras Udon: I don't think it was worth $18 haha came with 2 tiny little pieces of foie gras.. I will say that the broth had a nice deep flavor and it came with lots of yummy greens..   For those 3 items without tip it was about $50 so it's not cheap by any means but if you are looking for a nice sushi place that's a step up from your neighborhood joint but don't want to go all the way to the strip then Sen of Japan is perfect for you~  HOT TIP: Late night HH (Mon-Sat; 10:30PM-1:30AM)",

We were recommended to get the $85 Omakase so we did we got 2 and ordered other dishes that weren't a part of it. For a local place it's got really gold quality fish! Service was excellent our server was very thorough and explained every dish to us as it came to our table! It was a near close to Nobu experience with out the ambiance and a better price. Our tab came out to $400 plus 20% tip so be prepared to pay about $100-$150 a head for a good meal! It's not bad for good quality food! I would definitely come back and try more dishes I probably won't get the Omakase again. My only complaint is the portions from Omakase were pretty small, the foie gras on top of the sea bass was the size of a quarter so that def wouldn't fill you up so I was glad we ordered extra sashimi & nigiri on top of that. So 1 star off for that.",

On top of that some of the reviews were crappy about this place. So went with Ellen F. and the in laws around 6pm, we were seated right away.  There were four sushi chefs working at the bar and the restaurant was quite full, very busy. I ordered the nigiri sushi combination with a large asahi beer. My nigiri was delicious, no issues whatsoever with the food. Everyone else got there food though and I was still waiting for at least 10 minutes while the fam ate. Luckily they like to share so got a chance to try their food, the soft shell crab roll was to die for along with Ellen F's spicy tuna.  OK so apparently the sushi here is a good size compared to other joints that offer AYCE, when I do the AYCE at other restaurants the rolls are tiny. Here they were huge and plentiful, can honestly say I left full. Me and the fam had a shit ton of food and we kept ordering, the bill was under $180 and we ordered alcohol. IMO that is a good value considering we all had booze and we were a party of four.  I know it was busy but didn't like waiting for my meal while I stared at everyone else, they need to come up with a better system on getting the food out there, especially when it doesn't require cooking. The server was super friendly though!",

I'm happy to report that my trip to Sen was the shining highlight of our weeklong trip to Las Vegas! Come for a sumptuous meal at a palatable price.  L A N D Sen's rendition of a classic smoked duck tataki was divine. You absolutely cannot miss this!  S E A All the basic sashimi selections - yellowtail, albacore, o-toro - were dressed up in ginger, ponzu, lemon juice, and spicy mayo. (Please note that they only serve Hokkaido uni, which is not our preferred source.) Most notable was the grilled black cod soy, which was a deliciously unctuous miso-glazed filet.  S W E E T S Unfortunately, our tamago was soggy and overwhelmingly eggy. However, Sen redeemed itself with its molten chocolate souffle with green tea ice cream, silky custard-filled almond yuzu frangipane cake with vanilla ice cream, and green tea creme brulee.  With a $300 dinner tab that could've easily hit double at Kabuto or Yui, this place is a winner in my book for casual-yet-creative takes on Japanese cuisine.",

I am up here visiting my parents and my dad loves to go out for sushi when we come up. We normally go to a  different place but saw some good reviews so we thought we would give it a try. The place is clean and presents itself well.  Our server was attentive and took decent care of us.  While that is great I go out to sushi for FISH.  While it was fresh, the proportions were terribly small, to the extent that we were joking about it. The fish was sliced really thin, you could almost see through it. The premium sashimi plates (30 bucks apiece) we ordered, once again, had decent quality but such limited quantity, it was very disappointing. Lots of rice in the rolls. Not kidding, we spent a considerable amount for dinner and on the way home stopped at another place as we were still hungry.   The night before we had sushi of equal quality (we had gone to Ohjah, close by) but spent a lot less (still not cheap, but way more reasonable) and were quite satisfied with the experience.   I really wonder what people are comparing this place to when they are rating this place so high.",

They never let my hot tea go empty and for the amount of food consumed - what a bargain! Started off with popcorn shrimp with orange Aioli sauce, Black miso cod with butter lettuce, Fresh water eel roll, Black snapper sushi, #1 roll spicy albacore with tuna and spicy garlic ponzu and finished up with house made red bean ice cream.

    "text": "Went here on a Saturday night where the hostess graciously lead us to our reserved table. Our server was heedless yet informative.   What we ordered: + California roll: made with blue crab and authentic sushi rice +Otoro: tasty however chefs special sauce masked the taste of the fish +Spider roll: Best spider roll in town for the crispy texture, and authentic tasting sushi rice + Black cod butter lettuce: tasty but tiny portion -Rib eye sukiyaki with Foie Gras: Salty soup, additional $14 for an inch size of Foie Gras  - Akadashi miso: salty, served in a mini soup bowl with large spoon -Tiger roll: stale shrimp tempura, tuna topping was not seasoned with spice, not topped with eel sauce, rice was the only good thing -Tuna and yellow tail nigiri: ordered with chef special sauce which we don't recommend because the sauce masked the taste of the fish  The only worthy thing here was the rice--it's how sushi rice should taste, rice to vinegar ratio was perfection. Overall, the cons outweighed the pros so we will not return nor do we recommend this place.",

However the kitchen service was a little lacking when it came to consistency. Everyone in our party of six got their entrees in a timely matter except for one. It took an extra 15 to 20 minutes to just get a chicken katsu. It ended up being delicious just like every thing else but still the wait was dreadful since everyone was already finished with their food but we still had to wait on the katsu. Our waitress Nina was so sweet and attentive to our every need. She came over to apologize for the wait on the katsu and comped our party two free desserts for the hassle. The whole party ended up trying the franjipan. Apparently all of their desserts but the mochi are made from scratch which is great but it also takes time to cook. So it was another 15 minute wait for the desserts. I will definitely be coming back but now knowing how long it takes for dessert I'll probably order my dessert ahead of time.",

    "text": "Scam of japan. We were fed lies! I'm going to go ahead and swim against the tide on this one. This is not the first time that the ever so promising 4.5 star raving-review-average has steered us wrong.   My boyfriend and I got here right at 10:30pm for the late night happy hour. The manager, who also happened to be the host sat us immediately and the server came up to us right away and took our order. Everything started off perfectly.   Then came the wait. There were 3 sushi chefs on duty and the restaurant was far from full, but there was a decent wait time. I was in a fit of hunger, so we flagged down our waiter (who was sweeping) and asked him to add in 2 orders of miso soup, so that we can have while we wait for our food. He said sure and then went back to sweeping. (He was slow as molasses!) I kept thinking to myself, The food is going to come out before he ends up putting in the order for the miso soup - and what do you know, I was right. After some more waiting and looking around nervously, out comes our sushi orders and then the (slow as a slug) miso soup comes. Now, the annoyance of this was short lived and it was all forgivable (I was just crabby since I was hungry).   The deal breaker for us was that the happy hour rolls we ordered were beyond basic. I could get better sushi rolls from a buffet on the strip! We ordered the HH No.2 roll and the Lisa Lisa roll. Sadly, they didn't even give us the right roll. Instead of the recommended Lisa Lisa roll, we were served the unagi roll. We ate it anyways since we didn't know any better (and I was starving). Hey, I get it, mistakes happen. But they were crazy basic, bland, and boring. They were not impressive or memorable. Both rolls were exceptionally dry and one noted. A plastic, chemical flavor permeated the garlic ponzu sauce, possibly from the container it was sitting in.   The worst dishes we ordered had to of been the miso soup and the salmon carpaccio. Although we loved how the miso soup came out scalding hot, it was very sour. I've never in my life had a sour miso soup before, it left a terrible aftertaste. We both didn't finish it. The salmon carpaccio was delicate, yet offensively oily. Yes, they advertised that they use sesame oil in the dish, but that's all that we could taste. It did not compliment the salmon whatsoever. It coated our tongue and throats with oil and left such an unsettling feeling in our stomaches. We decided to politely but quickly cancel the rest of our orders - we couldn't eat anything else. The oil wrecked our palates.  The servers were very timid and apologetic. They really didn't care to know what was wrong. Though, we felt it was necessary to explain to them our disappointment. They said sorry about that, disappeared for a little bit, and then they brought out our check. We could see the manager pacing back and forth and going about it like nothing happened.  We paid our bill in a hurry and left over 75% of the eel roll, 60% of the #2 roll and 50% of our miso soup, when we walked out. There was a hefty amount of food that we left. (See picture). In the end we paid $33 for half of food we didn't eat and a stomach ache. We left unsatisfied and hungry, and we immediately drove to yummy sushi and grill. (We ended up spending $60 at yummy to get our fill, so, a grand whopping total of $100 for our dinner tonight - just because of our deplorable experience at Sen of Japan).  We are not in any way trying to hitch a free ride or freeloaders, but we truly felt that the management was unexceptional. The manager was dodgy, didn't show any effort, or even try extend his hand to help alleviate the situation. He didn't even come to the table to talk to us. Instead, he just said sorry about that as we were already walking out the door. As I was already half way out the door (standing in the doorway with my hand holding the door open), he then quickly asked us what was wrong with our food. We politely gave him detailed feedback and explained our issues. His response? He just said sorry about that and then defended the dish, telling us that the dish was supposed to taste like sesame oil. Ha.   I can't even. Too much disappointment for me to even continue. I would never expect to encounter such a poor experience from a highly rated, tried and True restaurant. To each his own.",

Mostly they're closer to the strip in China Town and Spring Mountain area, but here is Sen on Desert Inn. You wouldn't think much of it from the outside and the surrounding shopping plaza, but it is actually quite a nice restaurant. Great local spot for Summerlin, Sen offers the usual cuisine at a slightly higher price. They have an ok Happy Hour late night, but there are a bunch of better places just 10 more minutes down the road. It's not my favorite sushi spot, but it's quality.",

Nothing and I mean nothing compares to Sen.  I've been here more times than I could count and have never been disappointed. The fish is incredibly fresh and they sauce everything so no soy sauce is ever needed.  I will say their prices are a bit steep but you pay for what you get and it's worth every penny.   Notable faves-  Fluke sashimi with black truffle sauce  Grilled calamari with bell pepper sauce Black cod lettuce wraps Black snapper with garlic oil and capers sushi  The number 2 roll Spicy salmon sushi   The list goes on..... it's a must go!!",

The cod was a bit small in comparison to the butter lettuce it sat in, so you get a lot of lettuce for little cod. Flavors were nice and the cod was cooked well.   Salmon Carpaccio - Thinly sliced salmon sashimi w/ chives, sesame seeds, garlic and yuzu soy seared with hot sesame oil - $4.95 - surprisingly yummy. thin sliced pieces of salmon sashimi seared with hot sesame oil. gave a nice subtle flavor and aroma.   HH No. 3 Roll - Shrimp tempura, spicy tuna, serrano pepper - $6.90 - My friend and I were hoping this would be spicy due to spicy tuna and serrano pepper. We were wrong :( serrano pepper almost was like a bell pepper. added some flavor but mainly a crunch texture. spicy tuna wasnt spicy.   Yellowtail Nigiri - $3.90 - fresh yellowtail nigiri. simply said. nothing too extraordinary.   Salmon Nigiri - $3.40 - fresh salmon nigiri. same as yellowtail  Special Garlic Yellowtail - forgot how much this costed but this peaked my friend and I's interest due to the garlic... XD To be honest, nothing that special. I didn't taste any garlic flavor or notice any garlic aroma... It almost seemed like a normal yellowtail nigiri with a ponzu sauce.   As with all happy hours, prices actually rack up pretty fast. Pretty my friend and I, our meal was like $50 something bux. Not bad but i guess this style isnt my cup of tea... :P",

Had I not looked it up on Yelp, I never would have expected to find such good nigiri in this plaza, let alone for such good late happy hour prices!  Quality of the fish here is outstanding. Highly recommend coming during late happy hour, 10:30PM to 1:30AM, Monday through Saturday. Seems to be a popular HH, as all the seats at the sushi bar were taken so I had to dine solo at a table. Service throughout my visit was attentive and non-judgmental, despite my ordering half the menu.  Highly suggest ordering all of the HH nigiri listed- the black snapper with capers, red onion, and garlic soy sauce blew my mind. Salmon was thick, buttery, and beautiful, baked freshwater eel was just okay. The designated HH rolls are also good- HH1 and HH2 both involve the albacore and spicy garlic ponzu sauce but somehow still manage to taste like fairly different rolls. Ika-Age calamari, black cod butter lettuce, and mushroom miso weren't as memorable as the sushi options, but all were very solid. The lettuce wrap in particular was a very tasty small bite, the ika was enjoyable but not a must-have, and the miso was a good starter for the sushi, made heartier by the three thick slices of mushroom.  Interior decor is upscale, service is friendly, HH menu cannot be beat for pricing and quality- definitely a good secret date-night place!",

From the time you enter the restaurant, you're greeted with extremely friendly and courteous staff, then sat at a table with a comforting atmosphere.  I've spent several years on the strip working in some of the most prestigious of hotels as well as frequenting the restaurants of them, and this I can honestly say rivals and even surpasses most of them.  The food selection is very diverse and abundant, covering fishes, meats, noodles, nigiri, and sashimi selections, but also including what is now my favorite area are their specials listed on both the first and last page.  We tried several new items I'd normally have not tried on my own and found every dish to be spectacular in taste and preparation.   You can order dishes that are both smaller in portion or larger if you choose, and if you have any questions the staff is eager to help as they know, understand, and can explain the menu well.  As a local for 11 years here in Las Vegas now, I can say with supreme confidence this is undoubtedly one of my favorite restaurants in the city.   Bravo to the restaurant and its staff, I was really taken aback and pleasantly surprised at how amazing our experience was there and I can't wait to return.

So you're telling me your main dining area (which was actually also pretty full ) should SUFFER just because the bar was full?????   **someone replied to this comment saying to come on a Monday when it's not busy... umm so I have to come a different day to get even mediocre service? No thanks...",

We actually went to the most fancy expensive Sushi place at one of the best hotel in the strip and got horrified by their law quality and poor selection of raw fish. After we paid $300 for two just to be dissatisfied, we came here to fill our stomach up with something good.  This place is in the middle of nowhere (sorry!) but it's been here for 10yrs plus. people know and hail from everywhere to get real groumet Sushi.  Price is also super reasonable for the quality you get. Their chocolate souffle for desert is a MUST to try. Their Akadashi miso soup is REAL and same as what you get in top restaurant in Japan. Stop wasting your money on fake Sushi on the strip but just come here. You won't be disappointed. Their other menus such as steak and tempura are also very good. Highly recommended.  (!) ",

They have a great selection of food to choose from with a pretty good sized menu. Here are a few great selections from their late nite happy hour menu. The Black Cod Butter Lettuce Wrap is fantastic and so is that Salmon Carpaccio. The Homemade Gyoza is a house favorite and the Shrimp Tempura Orange Aioli was good. Sen of Japan is up to par with their food as expected from a restaurant on the west side that's been in business so long so no complaints. The staff is very polite and seem to have a great relationship with their patrons, there was a  lot of socializing and interaction between them. I was very happy with the food tonight and I will be adding Sen of Japan to my late night sushi list!",

    "text": "I give 3 stars.   Japanese fusion at Sen is pretty good - pretty much the same as Nobu but the half of the price.   But today, Japanese restaurant business is very competitive in Vegas - people have more experiences than 10 years ago -we all know how to use chopsticks - meaning that Nobu is no longer considered as a great restaurant - its just for yuppies who wanna talk about it to show off,,, that they have $$$. (Tho, all my wealthy friends from Japan think Nobu sucks a lot, that they don't wanna even talk about it).  I am sick of eating sashimi with jalapeno and kabosu, sashimi with stupid ponzu sauce, etc.  So, I decided to seat at the sushi counter just to eat traditional sushi.  It was a big mistake.  This young sushi chef didn't know what he was doing. He didnt even know the manner. While he was making sushi, he talked a lot,,,. He was even watching baseball game on the fuckin tv screen.   Ok, no sushi chef talks when he makes sushi because then it means he is spitting on the food. I was like, shut the fuck up and make sushi.   Watching tv? I mean, no sushi bar in Japan (except ghetto sushi place) has tv,,, they are not supposed to,,, because it is annoying. Sushi is very sensitive in taste. You have to really focus when you eat.   Well, he wasn't a Japanese chef, so maybe he was trained by all-u-can-eat place before he came to Sen. Vegas quality!  So, my suggestion is to sit at the table and order fusion dishes (3.5stars). But then, I would go to Raku (4stars) or Kyara(3.5stars - with better service) for fusion,,,, meaning there is no point to go back there anymore.   Btw, my standard is high. I give only one star for those all-u-can-eat places. So, regardless of the rudeness, 3stars is pretty ok. I just hope Nakano-San trains chefs,,, like Mr.Miyagi from Karate Kid.",

    "text": "After hearing and reading the much touted reviews of Sen of Japan the wife and I had to go there on our last trip to Vegas. Yes, we have heard that the head chef here was the former head chef at Nobu, yes we heard that Andre Agassi likes to eat here.   But talk is cheap. We set out to find out for ourselves.  Located about 6 miles away from The Strip, Sen sits a bit unassuming within a local shopping plaza.  Upon entering, we were even more surprised by the somewhat austere layout.  But that is probably why they can sell an omakase for $55 and $80.  Our waiter was very attentive and asked us if it was our first omakase here.  Apparently, if you have had it before, they give you different selections - awesome!  He also gave us an introduction to each course.  They were as follows:  yellowtail with yuzu and jalapeno - wonderful citrus notes and soft tender yellowtail.  Jalapeno added a nice touch and was very mild in heat.  kumamoto oysters with ponzu - very creamy and soft, with a delicate finish  sashimi salad with yellowtail, tuna, and salmon.  Spring greens gave a nice contrast and the dressing seemed to be a sort of soy vinaigrette - a nice light tartness.  All the fish was fresh.  Seafood spring roll - filled with crab and halibut, and topped with tobiko caviar.  This was deep fried and had a nice light crunch.  But the meld of the seafood made it a bit generic with the real crab inside getting a bit lost.  But still tasty.  Braised black cod with seared Hudson Valley foie gras - a nice contrast of flavors, but the textures did not make a great complement.  The cod was ultra tender and foie gras was less so.  Not the best foie gras I have had, but to be fair, it was at French Laundry.  Filet mignon was cooked perfectly and so very tender.  Clam miso soup - the normally mundane miso soup was transformed into something extraordinary.  The clam provided a flavor profile that can only be described as a match made in heaven with the miso.  Best miso soup I have ever had.  Assorted sushi - big eye tuna, scallop, fluke, young yellowtail, sweet shrimp, and snapper with a kiwi based sauce.  All the sushi was so fresh and delightful.  The kiwi based sauce was a nice touch and very unique.  At this point, everything that we had was so good we decided to go over the top and add two more items.  We ordered a roll that had crab, mango on the inside  topped with salmon, shrimp curry sauce, and diced red onion.  As far as rolls go, this was a wonderful change of pace to the standard mayo-creamy rolls that glut the sushi places.  Real crab melded with sweet mango combined for a very harmonious pairing and the salmon with curry sauce on top completed the entire pan-Asia tropical theme.    Then the coup de grace was the o-toro.  Most places just serve toro, but some places like Sen, distinguish between chu toro and o-toro.  They are both from the belly of the tuna (tuna's equivalent of bacon), but the o-toro lies further from the muscles and hence more fat marbled in.  It is a much lighter shade of pink.  The sushi literally melted in my mouth, I did not need to even chew.  If I had dentures, i would have gummed it and it still would have been tender.  It can only be described as heaven on earth.   Dessert consisted of a almond frangipane cake with pineapple sorbet and chocolate souffle with green tea ice cream. The frangipane had a nice light almond flavor and pineapple sorbet was a soothing complement.  The chocolate souffle though was a bit doughy and resembled more of a lava cake since it lacked the delicacy of a souffle.  Overall, the meal we had here represented an unbelievable value.  It would be easy to pay twice as much on The Strip and not be half as good.  The only negative point I would say is that the omakase consisted of flavor points too similar.  With yuzu, ponzu, and other similar acidic-salty tastes, there was little need for any soy sauce, but it also had the adverse affect of being a bit tiresome on the palate.  But this is just a slight technicality, all items were top notch, regardless.  Definitely a place that we will frequent on future trips.  Best Thing - o-toro and clam miso soup",

We came for their late night happy hour, which is great because I like eating late and night and feeling like I'm getting a deal. The place was basically dead and our waitress was friendly and very quick! We started with salmon carpaccio which was super fresh and silky and delectable. We also had a Lisa Lisa roll which was full of crispy crunchy cream cheese super Americanized sushi goodness, and a sauteed shrimp dish with ginger and chili paste and mushrooms which was SUPER flavorful.  The one thing that makes me bump them down a star from the four I would like to give was the Alaska roll we finished with, which tasted less-than-fresh to me. I am usually wary of sushi specials for this reason but everything else we tasted was delicious and fresh so it was probably a fluke.  I would go back, maybe for a proper dinner as the late night menu is inexpensive but kind of limited.",

I simply told the waiter to leave it up to the chef and to prepare whatever he thought we'd like and I couldn't have been happier! He kept bringing plate after plate of amazing sushi & sashimi that we couldn't get enough of.  They kept the beer & sake flowing too which is always a good thing! 5 stars for a great experience!",

If your car is in the valet, call them up, tip out the $2 and make the drive. For real. It was THAT good. I can compare the freshness, taste, and creativity to Katsuya in Studio City.. actually, better.  '  Our chef was Sha-hin (hope i didn't butcher the name) .. we sat at the bar, and it kept coming. From creative new rolls, to 3 different types of sushi I had never tried before.. It was absolutely amazing. I likes to crush my sushi, in mass quantities. Wifee hung in there pretty well. We shared a beer (I was driving, and can wait on drinking until im back at the casino).  Dinner for two $80. Tip additional.  Got there at around 9pm on a Saturday night. Not too busy. Nice atmosphere.. (not for ya'll who are super loud - no loud music, no rock n roll sushi gimmicks). Just a great place in a non-descript shopping center. This is my place everytime I am in town.",

    "text": "After having a horrible sushi meal the night before at another place which was selected by others I decided to find my own gem and sure enough through YELP I found Sen of Japan which is indeed a gem. Around 6:30-7PM my wife and I were graciously greater by the gal who seated us right away across their beautiful sushi bar and the sounds of simple yet hip music being played in the background. A few minutes later the manager Nick came over where I introduced myself and my wife and told him we were from LA, read their reviews as it was our first time there and we didn't want to be unhappy like we were from the night before. Nick has excellent customer service skills and gave a run down of their menu, how it is served, and the uniqueness of their selection of fresh fish. On top of that he said to keep room for their special chocolate shuffle with homemade green tea ice cream desert as it was on the house since we mentioned YELP.   We looked at the menu to find items that stood and different from what we have found at other sushi places. The items we choose were fresh wild salmon sushi with mango puree (also available as sashimi with mango puree) Fresh wild shrimp tempura with apple slices topped with a hint of mango sauce, fresh black snapper sushi, fresh blue crab, chicken yaki skewer their special fried avocado appetizer and our standby favorite rainbow roll. Have you noticed I used the word FRESH in the outline? This place is a must....quality, tasty and a place to relax.  Triple thumbs up  PS..Nick mention that they offer a LATE NIGHT HAPPY HOUR I believe 9PM to 12. Call for details",

    "text": "There's only a handful of Sushi Restaurants & Bars that are worth going to and it is a NIGHTMARE to traverse the minefield of, 'dead fish on bed of broken dreams' bilge  and 'what you call sushi,  I call a bad bowel movement' fusion rolls with sushi menu lists longer than the Bible (Roll over and get out of me already Roll)....    And going to the Strip can be a disparaging experience;  first of all, the transient slag can be obnoxious and utterly annoying-leaving all manners behind the minute they step off that plane.  And the looks of abject ennui / annoyance from the staff, either giving you condescending looks because they think you're an ignorant tourist, or trying to buddy up with you and being totally unprofessional, (I'm still trying to figure out if all that chummy conversation's for a better tip, if they're just high or completely incoherent)...    Being an independently run business in Vegas can be rough; first, you have to compete with the Casinos, (who have unlimited resources and budgets to produce the most mundane mediocrity at exorbitant prices) and then the local environment can be pretty desolate.  As is the case with Sen, it's located in a commercial center, which in its definition, reeks of banal modularity.  The front facade won't be on the cover of Restaurant Victim's Quarterly, nor will the inside win any interior design awards anytime soon.  But it's dark and moody in a semi-Japanese minimalist way, which is better than an over worked, over designed, venus fly trap of laser cut metal panels and lucite curved walls.....  The head chef/owner Hiro Nakano left Nobu at the Hard Rock to open up Sen, winning Best Japanese restaurant in the US in 2008 from Zagats as well as a recommendation from the Michelin Guide.  And most importantly, Sen is not outrageously expensive, considering the quality of fish that Mr. Nakano is able to procure.  We like to start off every meal with a little app, and here we had the Assorted Japanese Pickled Vegetables, (cuz we need more salt in our diet)! and a Cucumber Salad in Vinegar and Lemon. We also had a little bit of Sake (pronounce sa-KEH, not saki, please).  We ordered the Sake Flight-three glasses of various distilling methods that encompass the spectrum from light to full body.  Starting with the Junmai -Otokoyama from Hokkaido, the Nigori (unfiltered Sake) is the Momokawa Pearl. And finally, a Daiginjo: Hakutsuru Sho Une. I had a particular affinity to the Nigori, it had a great texture and complimented the Sushi. The Junmi was very light which was good with the lighter fishes but kinda petered out when it came to the oilier, heavier ones.  The Daiginjo was really bold (fire breathing dragon bold) and was akin to rocket fuel Grappa.  Smooth tho......  SO if it's your first time to Sen, I DO recommend the Omakase Course, it's the Chef''s choice selection of Sushi that is innovative, creative and delectable.  To call it fusion would be an insult, however, it is a diversion from traditional sushi flavor profiles. For most sushi, Soy Sauce is not necessary, the Chef brushes specific Soy Sauces to each Fish served, as well as various condiments to supplement its natural flavor, (jalapeno, ginger, micro greens, capers and scallions). Sen serves one of the few Western-Japanese hybrid cuisines that is flavor wise, successful and in very good taste (no spicy mayo globs here).  We got the Wild Shrimp Tempura, Apple and Inariage (seasoned fried bean curd) Roll with Tuna, Salmon, Mango, Micro greens and a Balsamic drizzle- it looked gorgeous!!!  With the Apple, Mango and Balsamic - it was on the sweeter side, but good nonetheless.   We ordered Sushi a La Carte and it was delicious (Rick's words...such the poet).... It was superlative; mouthwatering and fresh, we relished every bite.  Starting from the lighter fishes, we had the Tai with Scallions and then the Hirame with Capers.  we had the Maguro, the Hamachi and Saba afterwards.  being a little too elated, I forgot what condiments were on the Maguro, but it was good enough.   I loved the Hamachi with the Jalpeno, and Saba is always my favorite of the silver skinned bluefish....  The waitress said they had the Shima-Aji in today, (another blue fish favorite) it's got a little more refined tasted than Makerel, but still a robust fish that is satisfying.  We ordered the Unagi, which is just yummy with the sweetened Soy Glaze.  And we ordered the Uni (Sea Urchin) which is an acquired taste, (Rick is slowly getting used to the texture and briny flavor-even I admit in the beginning, it was like taking a gulp of sea water and sucking on a barnacle.. I was a kid then).  It was pretty fresh, Rick and I thoroughly enjoyed all our Sushi items.  Also, Sen has a full non Sushi Menu-so if you are a Sushi enthusiast, or just looking for a great Japanese Restaurant, Sen of Japan will not disappoint you!!  And having eaten at all of the Sushi restaurants along the Strip, we will go as far to say that this is one of the Best!",

    "text": "Where has this reverse happy hour been all my Vegas life?I love magical late night hours when food is discounted. This is a perfect example of why.  The first time I ate at Sen I had a full dinner experience at normal dinner time. The fish is off the hook fresh and when combined with the chef's delicate sauces you experience yummytown. I know that is not sophisticated, but it is accurate. On the first trip, I was still not completely open to fish as a consumable item, but we were being treated, so I politely ate everything. The ingredients are so quality that I had no problem truly enjoying it.    After that first visit, we did not make it back for quite a while. I am not sure why, but one evening when I remembered it was open until 2am, we decided to return. This is when we discovered the reverse happy hour! They have a good selection of tasty treats. We almost always get yellowtail with ponzu, which is not on the happy hour menu. And, on the happy hour menu, the black cod lettuce wraps kick every other lettuce wrap's tush! I am generally suspicious of these green tacos, but I love these little guys. The flavor is miso. There is a little crunch, and the portion is not meager.  Fellow night owls and insomniacs: I'll see you at Sen City!",

The salad was terrible! It was a bunch of spinach piled on top of a plate with a barely there dressing. It was bland and unappetizing. Maybe the only thing that worth the $6 was the rice. In terms of the entree, from past experience with filet mignon, if it's good, I don't need to dip it in sauce for flavor, but this one constantly needed dipping. My mom's sukiyaki was cloyingly sweet and therefore gave off a superficial taste. My dad's sashimi combo was nothing exceptional; presentation was alright with the bowl of sushi atop a bowl of ice to keep it cool, but in terms of taste it was average. The bottom line is that the food was edible but not noteworthy for the price, plus there might have been some MSG because my mom had an allergic reaction afterward. Also, the service was not great, our waiter was very opinionated and judgmental.",

Nobu, Roku, and all the others in the big hotels are fun, but are not the real deal. Sen of Japan, quite simply is!   Yellow tail belly was perfect, Tai served two ways was great, Shima aji, Kanpachi, Toro, all worthy of 5 stars.  The rice was slightly overcooked, but still the best in Vegas.   If you like sushi the way that I do, and you are in Las Vegas, there is no other choice. I know, you're in Vegas and you need everything to be way over the top, and taking a cab to end up at some regular strip mall doesn't sound fantastic...but for me it's all about the food.   I know there is a real Japanese sushi bar in every city, it just takes time and patience to uncover them! Yelp is a good resource to help find them, but the problem is many of the highly rated places are so Americanized that it can be misleading.   I don't like rolls!",

But the service is not good.  1) Sushi came out really late.  2) When I spoke to the owner that was standing behind me about the sushi being late, he told me, \"talk to the sushi chef, not my problem\".  So that got me pretty upset, but he kept talking.  He's extremely cocky and talks down at his customers.  So here's my suggestion:  If you want sushi, go to sushi-mon.  It's cheaper and just as good. If you want good Japanese food, go to Raku.  It's also cheaper, and probably better.  Now, if you're looking for an upscale-esque, \"cool\" Japanese sushi place that serves to the \"cool\" white-collar businessmen, with an overpriced menu that reminds you of a dining experience on the strip, while not being on the strip, then \"sen of Japan\" is definitely for you.

Yes, there may be better places in LA or San Francisco or even Japan, but for Vegas, it was great.     When soy sauce is not needed for sashimi, it speaks volumes about the taste of the fish and the complementing garnishments.  My menu for the night: -Yellowtail Tar Tar (~$10)- had this unique wasabi soy sauce sorbet  -Filet mignon tataki- thinly sliced in a light sauce - #23 roll (~$15)- Spider roll topped spicy tuna- the crab had a nice flavor to the batter  -Shin specialty platter ($20)- 7 types of sashimi, each with it's own complementing garnish; now that's labor intensive to prepare individual pieces  One of my favorites dishes oddly enough was the Calamari with Jalapeno Salt (~$10). It was served on top with a light dressed spinach salad.  The calamari was just so soft.  It was between a squid and white fish texture- very tender.   I would stay away from their \"skewered items\".  We had the combination skeweres ($9.50)- chicken, beef, veggie and scallop.  Heavily sauced and just plain.  Definitely not even close to Raku standards for skewers.   All in all- great experience.  Outstanding service.  We sat at the bar and had the Chef Shin talking to us the whole time.",

I sat at the sushi bar, to the left. The main chef that everyone talks about is at the center of the bar and I would recommend sitting in his vacinity. He'll help you build dishes on what he recommends, and that's what I really wanted.  Instead, I had to order through one of his side assistants and i felt like a neglected stepchild (watching all the edible gifts that the people ordering from the chef were getting was making me jealous). Instead, I was thumbing through the menu and guessing what might be really good here, and then waiting for the assistant to finish his megarolls before being able to tell him what I wanted. I believe the main chef noticed my fustrations at times and tried to intervene as much as he could.   I want to give 3.5 stars, but I'm rounding down to 3 this time on the Yelp scale.",

    "text": "We didn't have a reservation so we had to sit at the sushi bar! My date was impressed, I knew he would like this place when I had visited before alone... We had a #18: shrimp tempura with Apple, inariage and balsalmic drizzle that was surly off the hizzel. :) Defiantly a must eat when going here. We also had miso-soup which I always love. We also had a variety tempura. :) For desert we had Fresh baked chocolate souffle & green tea ice cream. Yumm!! I'm totally taking my next date there. & if I can't make his mouth water than the food sure will...  Xo Barbiie",

    "text": "The Black Cod I had here was just about the best piece of fish I've ever put in my mouth.  Extremely moist with a nice char and a delicious wasabi sauce.  The sushi and sashimi are super fresh and tasty, with some creative sauces and pairings.   Some of the entrees were a miss for me, namely the Filet Mignon with Aspargus in a mustard soy sauce.  Prices are reasonable, definitely worth a trip off the strip if you're visiting.",

    "text": "The best Japanese cuisine in Las Vegas off the strip. Even including the restaurants in the casinos, Sen of Japan still ranks in the TOP 5 in the city. This shouldn't come as too much of a surprise as the owner is a former Nobu chef; a small, pretty well known eatery. If you're looking for fresh fish, great entrees, and a fun environment, check this place out.",

    "text": "Being from LA and of Japanese decent, Las Vegas is plenty of fun, but lacks the great Japanese food that I'm used to.  Not so anymore, with Sen.  Plenty of people will tell you to go to plenty of places, just like all those billboards and ads that tell you their buffet is \"RANKED #1 IN LAS VEGAS\".  Well the Japanese buck stops at Sen. A little out of the way, you definitely need a car, but well worth the trip.  Excellent service, staff, food.  Can't wait to go back.",

    "text": "I had high expectations of this place because other yelpers said this has the freshest fish to offer. Really poor quality. Not fresh at all. You can tell because the fish is chewy and tasted bland. I had eaten at other ayce places and those fared even better. Sigh. Is it a bad night or just that people don't know what good sushi is?  Oh well one time and I'll never come back. I ordered the premium sashimi combo for the record. I also ordered foie GRAS. Also chewy.   oh the best thing was the miso soup with the shrimp heads.",
