I've eaten at numerous places in LA and happy to finally find a place where it reminds me of K town. Only complaint why no Hite beer? Although Cass is pretty tasty too. The service could use a lil improvement,  but when I did ask for something etc.. everyone was very nice.",

Every time she came around to change the grilltop, she would lift the top with our food that was cooking on it and gave us this disgust look to make us take it off. Never said a word to us. I work and everyone I know work in the industry so it's completely unacceptable. Oh yeah, I came in with a party of 5, she auto-gratted the bill off top. If I had the change I would've gave the tip to the support staff. But seeing she needed the money that bad. We just paid the bill. Pathetic. Shout out to the support team though. They killed it. Lady server, get off your high horse and show appreciation for people who give you business. And if you're so sour and salty all the time. Find another job.",

We are seated promptly and the place isn't too packed. But shortly thereafter, it gets filled up pretty quickly.  As we sit, there are already side dishes laid out on the table -- impressive. The potato salad, fish cake, and rice paper were my favorites. Our server, Jitto, was quick to take our orders as well. He was very free in offering his suggestions but I like when servers do that. It gives me a feel for different types of meat and trying new things. We ordered the brisket and bulgogi about two times each, the pork ribs, beef short ribs, beef belly, and pork belly. The portion sizes came out perfect! Not too much and not too little of meat. SADLY, only ONE order of steamed egg is allowed per table. Per table?! Not per person? And not AYCE? That's my one gripe about this place. Because I fricken love steamed egg, lol. But oh well.   Customer service was beyond excellent. Someone was always filling our waters, changing out our grill if it became blackened over, and we were constantly checked on to see if we wanted to place more orders.   Will definitely come back. I need more brisket in my life.",

    "text": "As much as I have eaten here in the past few years, last night wait and service kind of makes me want to rethink of going back or even to recommend for those who've never tried..  Be mindful, it's a KBBQ hotspot in Chinatown in a very small plaza area just by Spring Mountain and Decatur. Therefore parking is going to be a pain if you're heading over for dinner especially and it's just nightly thing I've notice since I live and pass by the area so many times after work. The earlier the better for parking I guess if you're lucky.   Now for the wait to even get a table. I think over the multiple times I have visited and dine at this restaurant, groups of four or less are obviously to accommodate than more than four. And since last night was a Friday night the wait time for my group of six was about a two hours wait  than what we originally planned. It kind of ruins the mood to even dine. Which I can understand because the restaurant's space capacity is more medium size and also have to factor on how fast or well other customers are cooking their food. The only thing that bugged me was that when accommodating larger groups and at a busy dinner service, an open available table for you group is another expecting wait. The offer we had was to sit separately, which bother everyone in my group. Why agree to sitting separately when you're group planned to have dinner together. And we were close enough to leave and go elsewhere until a table finally open for us. It also took a member of my group to explain that the wait is unacceptable when being told that it would be a less than a two hour wait and that there should be some kind of discount for not accommodating well enough. So it's just a bothersome for larger groups.  Now for the service, knowing it's busy . Most orders were delayed and they did forget utensils when asked for the soup and steam egg . It's overall not bad it's just lack of communication... which I can see a lot of turnover issues for the restaurant. *Also larger groups should probably just double your order just to avoid the wait on the server to bring you more of what you want.   I never really had a bad experience up until last night's waiting time. I normally always recommend this place to friends but I might hold back to it . I definitely would like to see a better way of keeping the wait list organized than just a clip board and yelling out for the next group outside of the restaurant over a roaring crowd.",

The great thing about this place is it's about the same price as other dinner AYCE places, but t also includes apps, a huge selection of meats and even seafood to grill, and dessert! The meat quality was really good, and the food was brought it very quick and prompt.  Our grill was changed after a while as well which was nice. Definitely check it out!",

    "text": "VISUAL AESTHETIC: 3/5 The shopping center, Seoul Plaza, that Hwaro is located in is extremely compact, with very few parking spaces in comparison to the amount of businesses. It's a tight drive and I always see a consistent amount of cars parked out on the residing streets. All the restaurants and shops are quite small as well, and hold a small capacity of people. Hwaro is a decent size, but the waiting area which tends to always been packed, is much too small.  The interior is cute and offers the subtle image of old school Korea, with the banners and the tree planted in the middle along with the soju caps. However, it is nothing extravagant or extraordinary. I found the location of the bathroom to be strange as it felt as though it was in the center of the building rather than in the corner, but nothing too strange.   The first thing I saw when we were seated was the water containers on the table. This is not uncommon at Korean restaurants or even restaurants IN Korea, however what I found strange was the amount of grease and popped food on the exterior of the plastic container. That was absolutely disgusting to me. I understand it IS a Korean barbecue restaurant so there will be oil popping, but there shouldn't be anything dirty for the next customer.  Along the lines of cleanliness, the tables also were not wiped down properly. I understand Hwaro tends to be PACKED and busy, with a queue that can last more than an hour long, but again, tables should be cleaned for the next customer. The fact that there was still oil and food debris on my table was disgusting, and I felt sick from the sight of the leftovers on it.   The vent fans above the grills were equally as dirty, with oil and dust covering them all over. I felt I had lost my appetite just seeing the mess that was around the restaurant. Quick service can be sacrificed for cleanliness.  FOOD: 2/5 We ordered from the all-you-can-eat menu and were not impressed, in the least. It was honestly all quite mediocre? The bean sprout and green onion salad () was way too sweet, and we found that to be True with all the marinated meats as well. The rice was strangely put into the bowls? Where the amounts were varying - one contained rice to the brim while the other bowl looked as if half was scooped out. One of the items we ordered, the baby octopus, had an extremely small serving. I almost laughed when it was TWO pieces for one order, and only ONE order per person? The garlic that we had asked for was not cut or peeled well, with the brown tops still in tact and the skin still on the cloves.   SERVICE: 3/5 I came here on a couple different occasions, both of them on a whim, and was told to wait forty-five minutes. Instead of waiting, I left and went elsewhere. However, this occasion I came during a slow hour, around three o'clock in the afternoon or so? I waited a few minutes and we were seated almost immediately.  Our server was Hanchie and he was very friendly and nice, however lacked a bit of attentiveness. For ten minutes, we waited while waiters stood around. We watched another table's guests wave their arms around until it caught the attention of a server, so we attempted the same thing and finally managed to get their attention. But again, lack of attentiveness, because our grill wasn't turned on until I mentioned it (this was after the meat we ordered had arrived at our table).   The scissors at our table were so terrible that we could barely slice through the meat. Utensils should be checked ahead of time, and our server actually watched us struggle terribly with cutting but never bothered to ask if we needed it changed; we were the ones to request.  After the first round of meats, we needed to have the grill pan changed. This is probably a personal preference, but I found it quite gross to see that the grill pans were all pre-oiled and that they were put on trays that looked quite dirty (foot leftovers), while being wheeled around the restaurant. Mistakes happen but our server did a very poor job of changing our grill pans and ended up actually spilling sauce in my lap due to the clumsy job.  Besides the fact that our server was not very attentive, nor was he quick, he also managed to constantly put plates of meat down that allowed the contents of the plate to touch the (as mentioned above) dirty table.   OVERALL EXPERIENCE: 2/5 Honestly, I was excited to try Hwaro. There are so many raving reviews and I only heard good things from acquaintances. However, I found that the side dishes and meats were all way too sweet, were nothing special, and that the venue overall was not that clean. The servers were extremely friendly, but they were slow. I understand it was probably after lunch time, but that does not mean that service should be taken away from customers when it is not prime time. I will not be returning to Hwaro, KBBQ restaurants are a dime a dozen and I know a handful of better places in town.",

From spicy pork to enoki beef there isn't much Hwaro is missing in my opinion. There is a 90 minute time limit so cook and order in a timely manner if you want to be able to try everything! This place doesn't do reservations so the wait can be a little long on weekends. However we were told 45 minutes for our party of 8 and it ended up being only a 30 minute wait which was great! Highly recommend this joint to anyone looking for quality Korean Barbecue!",

Ended up in the total opposite place but it seemed busy enough we just had to try it.  5/5, Service: Coming from Hawaii, service at a yakiniku place is a hit-or-miss 50% of the time. Maybe it was luck, maybe it wasn't, but Hwaro certainly knew how to give great service despite how busy they were!  5/5, Food: Coming from Hawaii where yakiniku is a popular item for late night dinners, I came with the same expectations. I was certainly shocked that the menu was nearly 5x larger for the same price! It wasn't just random items that no one ordered either! Ordered more than I though I could handle but we ended up clearing out almost all of it because it just tasted too good to waste!  If I'm ever craving yakiniku, Hwaro is definitely a place to visit again. Sure wish we had their selection and service back home!",

The quality of meat you get here is seriously the best in town for AYCE. They give you your own bottle of brisket sauce which is extremely helpful so you don't have to keep flagging down your waitress for refills. It can get really hot in here and I feel like the floors and tables are perpetually sticky because of all the oil and grease that comes with KBBQ. For me, the absolute must haves are their brisket as well as their JALAPENO GARLIC BEEF BELLY! They also offer you a choice of an affogato or scoop of ice cream to top it all off.   The only time I can ever come here is right when they open because often times I do find that the wait time is ridiculously long for someone with a toddler. While I do think the food is worth the wait, it's just not worth the toddler tantrums.",

    "text": "Overall, a decent experience. This was mine and my girlfriend's first time at a Korean bbq. We waited approximately 35 minutes. I gather that there's normally a long wait here. After being seated, we met our server. He asked if it was our first time and we told him that it was. However, he did not help us AT ALL. He didn't tell us anything and walked away. Then, he came back and started recommending very specific items on the menu as if it was clockwork. He didn't give us time to check out the menu.   Ultimately the food was on par. We figured out what to do and we were pretty full. My girlfriend and I did feel very rushed and as if we didn't learn anything. If we went back, we wouldn't know the ropes or what items were what.   I was getting ready to check out so I requested the check, yet we had some spicy chicken left to cook. I did this solely for the sake of timing. I put the chicken on the grill and then he abruptly left and it seemed as if our server was in a rush. We came to find out that he turned off the gas line to our grill, so we couldn't cook our food, and then gave us our check. So we had raw chicken on the grill (which we were saving for last) and I had to pay.    Honestly, it was just a bummer that we explained to our server that we were new and he didn't help us at all. He told us \"good luck,\" then came back later with our food. It seemed pretty sarcastic. Again, the food was on par; nothing special. I will likely try another place next time because this was not a wholesome experience. I feel as if giving them 3 stars is wrong, but I want to give them the benefit of the doubt.",

Working in the business I get out late and don't have much options when craving BBQ, but this place does just fine.  The meats are good, they have added a few more items the past couple months. (Probably due to all the competition of other BBQ joints popping up around here)   The brisket, spicy skirt steak, & shake shake rice is my favorites here. What makes the brisket gold is their sauce though.   However, the 4 star comes from their service. I've been coming here for almost half a year and the crew they had before with the older lady and couple servers were sweet and efficient.   The past couple months I don't see them anymore, and there's one particular individual that just seems off every time I've been here since. Tall skinny korean guy just stares at you once you walk through the door. No greetings, and just points at the sign in sheet. I've seen him work too, no urgency, nonchalantly walking/looking around.   Smile bro.",

But unfortunately my last visit I went with my friends (8 of us total). We all finished and paid. We chilled right outside the door just relaxing and letting our stomachs settle with all the food we ate. As we were outside a worker came outside and told us one person didn't pay; accused us and kept walking in and out. Every time she came back out she repeated again, \"Someone didn't pay\". Which is weird because literally she was one ringing us out. 3 of us paid for 2 each. Last two paid separately. My boyfriend paid $35 in cash and rest on card for the both us. So unless she is pocketing our money. I don't understand why she would accuse us. SHE RANG US UP. Why would we not pay and just stand outside? Very unprofessional.",

    "text": "Amazing succulent cuts of meat. Me and my family came here the day after Christmas. We were hungry and I heard about this place through word of mouth. I've seen people waiting outside in front of this place the many times I go to this little strip mall. Well this place knocks it out of the park. When they seat you there is already a good amount of banchan waiting for you at the table. You can get as many refills of whatever you want. There are three price categories(lunch, dinner, all day). All day was the most expensive at around $23 ish dollars and allows you to order from the whole menu. I of course took the all day option because I didn't want to limit my experience. Basically you order what ever meat you want from the menu and however much you want as long as you can finish it. Don't be a monster and order more than you can chew. There's a sign that says you'll have to pay extra if there are leftovers, anyhow be a decent human and order what you can handle. Once the meat gets to the table then you start grilling. The meat cooks pretty quick depending on what it is. The grilles get changed out with clean ones once they start to get black. Believe me, I was impressed by the cleanliness and the pride this place just conveys. The servers were very attentive and friendly. I appreciate that, I did not feel rushed or pressured to hurry up and order something else thinking I wouldn't see my server again. The experience I can safely say was grand and oh so delicioso. I will come here again. Bring your friends because eating here promotes a great way to engage in conversation.  Have a few drinks and just embrace the great time you will have. Salud!",

    "text": "AYCE KBBQ at its finest!  As a Tofu Hut fanatic, it was refreshing to be spoiled and choose from over 50 items on the menu for $22.95, a few dollars more than Tofu Hut. I really like that they have tons of sides and appetizers to choose from! But the main stars, of course, are the meats. It's a bit overwhelming to look over especially if you're used to choosing from just a couple of items.  My favorite sides and appetizers would have to be the Green Leaf Salad (I am obsessed with the dressing, we ordered 5 bowls of the salad, seriously), Fish Cake (best ones compared to other KBBQ joints), Corn & Potato Salad (creamy, mushy potato salad with corn bits, so good), KFC or Korean Fried Chicken (crispy, yummy goodness). As an alternative to rice, they also offer Rice Paper, which is rare to see here in Vegas (last time I checked).  For meats, we really enjoyed the Green Tea-Smoked Pork Belly, Red Wine Pork Belly, Short Ribs, Brisket, Sliced Ribeye, Skirt Steak. These meats were marinated so well and all were so flavorful. The short ribs were to die for, super tender and sweet. The pork bellies were very tasty also, especially paired with the sesame oil and bean paste combo.  Of course, there are a few cons to this place. I usually LOVE eating bean sprouts as my banchan but Hwaro's version is my least favorite out of all my KBBQ spots. They pair it with green onions and a spicy sauce and honestly, I just want my plain bean sprouts salad. They give you so little of the bean sprouts in a huge bed of green onions in a large bowl. Wuuut? I also didn't like their corn cheese. Just like a few Yelpers here, it was disappointing. There was too much mayo, took forever for the cheese to melt and it comes in a super tiny container. Definitely skip this. Also, the steamed egg was super bland (good thing it's only one order per table, we would have wasted 4 of them if we all ordered one). Lastly, Spicy Pork Bulgogi was so salty and not spicy, it was pretty confusing.   Heads up! 18% gratuity was automatically added to our bill with 4 people. I wasn't aware so the price initially shocked me but they really work for it with fast and friendly service. Our grills were changed quickly and our orders came in accordingly. All in all, I would recommend Hwaro to KBBQ lovers out there.",

Was really looking forward to trying it too after great reviews. Will not be bringing groups here at all. Very disappointed in service (or lack of)",

Second it's an eye sore having to see part of the kitchen and looking at how the servers handle your food. Touching their nose and mouth then your food! Ahhh!! l was pretty disgusted how they serve water. They pour water with a red bucket into these pitchers. I just sticked to can soda. THIS PLACE HAD POOR STANDARDS OF FOOD HYGIENE.   Our server did not really communicate with us. Yeah it had a cute atmosphere but the food lacked in flavor, our table was greasy, menu was sticky, plastic cups were not dry. Awful just awful.

They keep the portions small so you can try several different dishes (except for the premium steak which is pretty big). Some dishes are allowed one per table and some are allowed one per person. However, most choices are unlimited.   They highly recommend the skirt steak but it's nothing special. The meat was a bit tough and chewy compared to other skirt steak I've had at other Korean restaurants. The vibe inside the restaurant is cool but the music could be considered a bit loud for some. But we didn't mind at all. Be prepared to wait a while especially on weekends or holidays. Overall a good experience. I would come back.",

Don't really have any complaints about the meats - The kal bi - short ribs were delicious.  The Hwa Ro pork belly is sliced paper thin.   It was alright.  Give me the regular pork belly so i can get the thickness.  Pork skin was decent - cook it longer so it can get a little more texture and crisp-ness.    As for everything else, I thought the ban chan was sub par.   The cheesy corn i'm not sure i get.  I like my noodles/rice al dente but the korean rice cakes were extremely hard to eat.  For a $20 price tag you cant go wrong.   I'm not sure if this is a promo rate.  I won' go out of my way but will join if others are going - I d rather pay more and go down the street to Lee's.  Yes i'll take worse service (who cares - it's asian) to get better ban chan and a better AYCE even if it is a little more.    But for a $20 deal, this is pretty decent - the place is really clean and modeled nicely.",

The decor, atmosphere and theme was pleasant and welcoming.   The food and sauce were excellent, we enjoy everything we ordered. The steak, pork belly, beef belly, flank steak, bulgogi (chicken and beef), spicy chicken, bulgogi nachos, shake rice, KFC, all of the condiments like kimchi/fish cakes and other stuff and garlic butter were all good. We ate a lot of meats!   Customer service was excellent, they always came around removing your dirty plates, bring you more ice  water, exchanging your grill, and asking what you need. Their service was up there.   The reason why I gave it a \"4\" Star was because of the heat, it was hot in there. I totally understand there were hot grills going and it was hot outside, but it should cooler inside. I used a lot of napkins to wipe off my sweat. I'll still go there but maybe in December or January when it cools down outside.   FYI, 5 or more people, they charge 17% gratuity automatically.",

Later when they brought out dipping sauces, my boyfriend asked for their main dipping sauce and another waitress kindly warned him that it was made with soy sauce. So the first waitress must have let the other know about our allergy preference, which is sweet (even though my bf can eat gluten). I asked for the salt and pepper sesame oil, and Chile sauce - both gluten friendly.   The meal came and waitresses were attentive, although since they were busy the sauces and sides came out a little slowly. We were in no rush though and it wasn't really all that bad. We ordered brisket (which was a little tough) Also tried the green tea pork belly (not really a noticeable flavor to me), the jalapeno garlic pork belly (Smokey flavor but not much jalepeno and definitely not spicy), pork cheek (pretty good), and beef belly (also good). My bf finished the grill off with some marinated dishes that I was too full to eat anyway (which when ordered, the waitress kindly reminded us again were marinated dishes). He got spicy skirt steak and bulgogi which he said were \"really good.\" He also got a #25 (\"The shit\") which was like a fried jalapeno popper with a chesey mayo teryaki sauce. He said it definitely earns its name.  Unlimited refills on side dishes including kimchi (questionable on gluten so I passed), potato salad, sweet chile cucumbers, radish, marinated onion (not gf), fish cake (not gf), and salad that had a sweet vinegar dressing I was fine with.  For dessert you also get a free ice cream (I told you it's worth the money!) We each ordered the affogato. Unfortunately for celiac or gluten sensitive people, it comes with some kind of honey-bunches-of-oats on top (most likely not gluten free) but I let the waitress know and she apologized and quickly got me a new one without the toppings.   For what you get, this place is really worth the price. The food quality isn't like wagyu beef status but it is pretty darn good. We never ran out of water or had anyone ignore our table of 2 despite the busy lunch hour. Free sides and delicious ice cream at the end to top it all off. Can't complain about anything honestly but if i were to improve the place, I would mark the gluten free items on the menu.  5 stars for this place considering price, food quality and options, allergy accommodations, and service. Would definitely visit again when craving kbbq.",

    "text": "Yum yum yum. My favorite Korean BBQ place In Vegas. Man does this place hit the spot. It's located off strip and there is always this annoying wait. You put your name on the list and wait to get called. Smaller parties are seated first. From 11:30 am- 3 am is the all day special- $23 per person. Lunch and late night special $19.95 (just can't order from special list). The menu is quite extensive. They give you all the side dishes you want (them potatoes are so creamy and delicious!! Fish cakes were very good too)  Favorite appetizers: -garlic butter: basically whole garlic soaked in butter that you put on the grill. Need I say more? -bulgolgi nacho- nom nom. I love anything nacho though -seafood salad-  hodge podge of sashimi. Also very good.   Favorite meats: skirt steak, pork belly, and bulgolgi. Heck try them all if you can. It's all you can eat but word of caution- they make you pay if you don't finish.   Afogado for dessert was really good. Unique.   Service is good. They change out your grill plate frequently and are very attentive to that.   Go hungry and you will get even hungrier and definitely hangry from the long wait, but all of that will be forgotten once you're seated and gorging yourself. Happy eating:)",

    "text": "Definitely one of the better KBBQ places in town! Great staff, great food. We went in on a Wednesday evening (6:30ish?) with a party of 6 and waited about 30-45 minutes for our table. This place always seems to be busy so I wouldn't be surprised if the wait is longer on weekends!  Jitto was our server and he was extremely attentive to our table. We had the AYCEand I definitely think it's sooooooo worth it. The quality of food and the amount of food you get is worth it for the price of AYCE which I think was $21 or $22 - pretty much the same as other KBBQ places I've been to in town. You definitely get your money's worth. The menu has so much to offer but I honestly generally don't get more outside the typical meats - bugolgi, short ribs (my personal fave and it was delish here!), pork belly, beef tongue, beef brisket, etc. so I can't speak to anything else. I can tell you however that the meat I do normally get was really good.  As with most, if not all, Korean dining places, you get the necessary side dishes. We had a table full of them and our server or the busser kept coming to refill that and our water without us even realizing! The salad they provide in the beginning is also yummy and a great starter.  Bonus points: AYCE comes with desert! Their affogato ice cream is yummmy!  Looking for a place to have KBBQ? Hwaro is your best bet. Get your money's worth. Make your tummy happy.",

All-you-can-eat all day special for $20.95; for lunch & late night (11:30am-3:00pm & 10:00pm-3:00am) is only $17.95... they not only offer a large variety of meat and the traditional side dishes, but also offer a bunch of yummy appetizers.   We ordered: - skirt steak - sliced rib eye  - short ribs  - brisket - beef tongue - bulgogi nachos - kfc (korean fried chicken) - the shit (same one offered @ Sushi Neko!) - steamed egg  - steamed white rice  - green tea ice cream  Everything was very satisfactory... the food was delicious, service was great, and we left extremely full! Also probably the nicest Korean BBQ restaurant I've been to as well... loved the decor! We will definitely be back!  PRO TIP: Leave a Yelp review & receive a free drink! :)",

Staff was friendly and very efficient despite the ongoing line outside & in the waiting area.

They give you a lot of that. A plate full beef tongue. Their bulgogi meat is tasty. Ribeye, spicy skirt steak, enoki beef, beef flank, the shit are in my short list next time.   Service is good. They will come and take your order when you are about to run out of food. They also change your grill very often. There is a limit of 90 minutes though.   There is always a line, 20-45 minutes depending on what time you are there. Parking is a pain. It's in the same shopping center with Raku, monta ramen and Kung Fu tea, and the parking lot is tiny, so if you're lucky, you'll get one there, otherwise, just park on the street and in the other parking lot across the street (only at night time).",

Order a large bottle of Japanese beer to share and eat our weight in Korean BBQ.  One price, a-la-carte style ordering of whatever meats in their menu that you fancy. First the banchan, then comes the drinks, then comes whatever it is you ordered. 2 to 3 at a time is my rule, however many the group can handle. My favorite would probably be the pork belly and the guts. I could have those all day.   It's not a big giant place. The setting is pretty intimate, so if you're bringing a large party expect a bit of a wait. The the booths are rather intimate as well. Probably 4 people max,, and not the big girthy American size either. The place is kept very tidy and clean. The servers are on point as well. They took great care of us. Very accommodating and very intuitive,, chop sticks drop on the floor, they magically appear to bring a new set. Yea, that's what I call service!!  Thank you once again for an amazing experience Hwaro,,, next time I'm in Vegas and I'm in the mood to eat my own weight in Korean bbq,, I'll definitely pay you a visit.",

On top of that, I had to constantly ask them to clear our emptied plates, and WHY DO YOU LET PPL COOK PORK/MEAT/INTESTINE ALL IN THE SAME BBQ PLATE?!! YOU WANT PEOPLE TO GET SICK? At switch the tray in a timely manner for chrissake.  I gave them 2 stars cuz i pitied the servers for lack of training and they lucky I didn't get sick from cooking meat and pork at the same time.

I like the idea having dessert & appetizer w/the all u can eat... Serving is small portion which is more ideal so you'll make sure you'll finish it... It's a great place... From now on will be going here instead of tofu hut... I only gave 4 star just because they gave us a dirty plates when we were seated which is in guessing it's a mistake...But all in all food was great!",

My last two visits fortunately, my boyfriend and I experienced the best experience here ever.  I spoke to the new hostess and she confirmed that there is a whole new staff!

In any case, I never had the urge to actually try this place until I received a text from my boyfriend at midnight saying he wants Korean barbecue.  Tofu Hut is our normal go-to place for Korean barbecue and it's always suffice until this very late night.   We walked into Hwaro with empty stomachs, craving and yearning for that delicious Korean barbecue. It was 1:30 in the morning and the waitress welcomed us with open arms. Atlas! A place that wouldn't turn us away. She did warn us that last call to order anything is at 2:00, so we were determined to get our cravings fulfilled. We placed 3 orders of pork belly, 2 orders of brisket, 1 order of short ribs, and 1 order of their steamed egg soup.  There must have been a miscommunication with the pork belly because we only got 2 strips, but that didn't even bother us because we were in awe at our good their brisket tasted. It was enough for us to order 2 more! Their short ribs were perfectly marinated - enough flavor without making it too sweet. Their steamed egg cannot be matched! It was super fluffy with vegetables included inside. I'm literally salivating at the mere thought.  The environment itself had a very rustic Asian feel to it. I felt like I was in a hut with \"rock-like\" walls separating us from the next party. They have a few large sized tables for bigger parties and smaller sized tables for parties of 4 or less. In comparison to Tofu Hut, this place seems bigger.  We ended up leaving this restaurant, fully set that this place has now become our late night spot for Korean barbecue.",

I feel like they took the time to make this place look decent or well in this case more than decent. It's nice to eat in a place that looks nice... Am I right? It just shows how much they actually care about their customers. Anyways, enough with the rambling let's get to business. I visited this place twice. The first time was when they first opened and the second was just recently. Let me start off by saying how I love how there's not much of a wait here. The most I ever waited to be seated was 10min maximum. (I only came here for dinner) After signing in, they have these booths on the side and chairs for you to sit on while you wait to be seated. This restaurant is spacious and has 10+ grills if I'm not mistaken.  They have A LOT of side dishes... And I mean A LOT. They also have different varieties of meats that set them off from the rest of the other kbbq places, such as baby octopus, pork skin, etc. I always stick to my usual brisket, pork belly and squid. But I was feeling adventurous and tried the marinated baby octopus and pork skin. They were both very delicious! I also love how they have complimentary soy bean paste soup & steamed egg! My faves.  Customer service was very good! All the servers were very nice & always checked up on us.  Overall, I love this place! Totally worth the money. Good food & good service, you can't beat that.",

    "text": "I'm a huge fan of KBBQ, but not a fan of this place. Honestly, I felt that so many things went wrong with my experience, that maybe the restaurant was having a bad day, but honestly, I have had better quality meat from more \"average rated\" KBBQ places.   My honest opinion is, it's a bit of a letdown compared to the other restaurants and food places that surround it.   AMBIANCE: 4 - Super intimate and really cute. It's definitely a place to take your meat loving friends on a romantic (or platonic) date. It's a very friendly setting, and the other groups are sitting far away enough so that they don't have to hear your silly banter and conversation.   SERVICE: 1 - The staff was friendly, but they were slow and inefficient. There was barely that many people, but we barely got served at all. My friend raising or waving her hand took up half of our time that we spent there. When they finally got around to us, they handed us our meat fairly quickly, but forgot to give us metal tongs and scissors. Another 15 minutes passed before we finally got noticed and someone gave them to us.   FOOD: 2 - Was all the food fresh? Yes, it was. Was it amazing? Not really. I mean, the kim chi was probably the best part. And I don't really like kim chi all that much. The salad was good. Honestly, I have experienced better quality meat at Korean BBQ Garden house and Tofu hut, and several places in California. When I eat KBBQ, I don't usually eat the marinated meat.   By this point, I was definitely upset and I wasn't impressed in the slightest. I was there late night and they even charged me the wrong price (19.99 instead of 16.99), but I wanted to get out of there so bad that I didn't even care. Not a place that I will frequent.",

(14 tables)  The two employees were both extremely polite and they were definitely trying their hardest to attend to everyone. Next, the decor...it is very spacious and I loved the eclectic design they had going on. Lots of natural woods and concrete.   Ok...on to the food!   Everyone who loves Korean BBQ obviously loves meat, but I think the starters can make or break a KBBQ spot! Their salad is GREAT! Super crisp lettuce, the sweet and savory dressing has just a touch of heat too! Their other starters include Mac salad, marinated jalapenos, kimchi, marinated tofu and bean sprout salad! Everything was SUPER FRESH!   The main courses...very good! The \"fat ass\" or wine marinated pork belly was our favorite! The short rib and beef flank were OKAY. We did enjoy the baby octopus too!   The steamed egg and the complimentary soup were both very good!   The $19.99 price was superb for the quality of food!   (Update) A third worker did so up to wait on tables mid-way through our meal! I can also say all of the workers were extremely nice!   Solid KBBQ spot!",

    "text": "We came to this place for lunch on Memorial Day at 1:00 and there was one waitress serving around 8 tables by the time we got there. The waitress didn't even acknowledge us when we entered. It took twenty minutes to get us seated, with 2 parties leaving by that time.  She served our water, side dishes, and had our stove set up by the time we spent an HOUR there. By 2:06 pm, we didn't receive our meat at all. Yet as I observed the other tables, other parties had their meat delivered and the last item delivered was our sauces. After trying to satisfy our hunger by eating all the side dishes, we decided we had enough of the wait and wanted to leave. The waitress didn't even try to fix things and just let us go. Way to make us feel like we mattered at all.   This is my first time at a KBBQ with such horrible customer service as this. How is it that it is taking us a FULL HOUR to get us started when the place wasn't even full house? At first we thought it was because there was only a single waitress taking care of the floor, but how she managed to get us started was unnecessarily slow. It didn't make sense why she had to serve us our water and sides at 10 minute intervals and not get our meat and stove started. We went over to another KBBQ place after that and managed to get seated, get our meat, and finish our meal within the next full hour. Compare that. We all thought Hwaro would be great because of the previous yelp reviews but our time was WASTED on this place. We tried to be patient. We really did. That's why we were foolish enough to spend an hour on service that ignored us from the beginning.   I do not recommend going to this place, unless you want to be ignored and treated poorly. 1/2 a star.",

Nari is my favorite!!! But she now works the late shift 10p-closing :( They stay open later now, til 3a. Oh well, guess I'll just have to come here for my late night food cravings.

Unfortunately yesterday, May 15th, on my 23rd birthday my family and I decided to dine at Hwaro for my birthday dinner. The service we received was absolutely horrible. Our server, Stephanie, came to our table to greet us and get drink orders, once to take the initial order, and then was never to be seen again. Our table was stacked with dirty dishes, the grill was black and charred, and we had no water the entire time we ate. I got up and flagged someone down and asked one person if they could go get our server and she never came over. I got up a second time and flagged another server down and asked again for her to come over. Finally she came over, took our dessert order because at that point we just wanted to leave, and she never came back again. Overall it was a really really disappointing dining experience and really ruined my birthday dinner.",

I'm a regular here at Hwaro & never have I ever had the service that I just experienced. I usually come to eat here at night but I figured I was in the area & craving yakiniku so I wanted to give lunch time a chance. NEVER AGAIN.  Now I don't know if there is a different between the quality of service between day shift & night shift, but it really feels like it is. I'm so used to the staff being on top of everything (night shift), they're so much more friendly, always checking in on my table & I, giving us bigger portions, etc. I never left as unsatisfied as I just did today The service that I had just experienced was everything BUT great. There was 3 of us - we ordered 3 orders each of pork belly, brisket, & jalapeno garlic beef belly. Our server came back with only one order which was kind of annoying because we kept having to call her back to frequently to order more food. I also ordered a Coke which I never got. Another women (who wasn't our server) she was bringing us the potato salad, etc but also dropped off jalapenos. I told her we didn't order that & she seriously gave me a stink look & attitude! Didn't even take it. She left it! Super rude!   I didn't get her name but she was Hispanic looking. I don't know if she didn't understand English or if this was her first day on the job but she came off super rude.  Another annoying point was right before we left, we asked for the check THREE times. & asked our server to kindly remove the Coke that I ordered from the bill. She brought us our ice cream & forgot, we asked her for the check again, she forgot again. Finally I waved her down & asked for the check for the 3rd time. She still didn't remove the coke from the check.  Anyway, this will be the last time I come in during lunch. Always going to be sticking to dinner because even though they're busier they're more on top of it as far as service.",

Loud but you can still hold a conversation. I'd go here with a group and a plan to drink lots of soju.   Be warned If you get seated in the back corner like we did it is 10 million degrees back there. There was no fan by us and tall walls on 3 sides to trap the heat in. It felt like a sauna. Also the little wall ac thing does nothing.  Lackluster planning if you ask me. (-1 star because that sucked and most kbbq places have fans for every table)  Food was pretty good. Try 'the shit' and garlic jalapeno beef belly.  Both were top notch and packing flavor. The beef belly is thin not thick and hard to chew like some places. Mmmhmmmm cow bacon..... yum...  We also ate a lot of brisket which is our go to kbbq choice. The brisket was yummy fatty and tasted great. I just wish they had a few oil free dipping sauces and whole garlic to go with the brisket.  Service was A++ out server Jannifer was the best. She asked about allergies and restrictions and answered all of our questions. She was everything an A++ server should be. She defiantly went the extra mile and was on her A game the entire time.",

    "text": "Hwaro definitely gives Gen a run for their money. If you're a Gen fan (like myself), then you're going to LOVE Hwaro. Same concept, but the meat is exceptional. We tried the beef brisket, bulgogi and premium cut steak (rib eye). We must have ordered at least 4 rounds of the brisket. Something 'bout thin cut, slices of meat with a flavorful lean half and fatty juicy other half. I loved the brisket!   They have a special \"house sauce\" that is perfect with every piece of meat. Be sure to also order the brittle and garlic sauce. This sauce is life-changing!  I can't wait for my next visit to Hwaro! This is the BEST Korean barbecue in Vegas!!!!!!",

I've been there a few times and each experience has just been mediocre in comparison to the other kbbq places I've been to. The atmosphere always feels hectic and it affects my overall comfort level when I eat. Even though it's a small space, workers are constantly running around as if their in a rush or they forgot something.   Aside from that, I think their menu has definitely improved. There's more options for appetizers and sides which are just as good as the meat. Sometimes the meat you get is mostly fat, but it's still good. I would suggest going at a less busy time, so that you can enjoy your meal without feeling rushed.",

    "text": "There's been a lot of hype about Hwaro over the past couple of months, so I decided to finally go because I was craving some AYCE KBBQ. I came on a Monday around 4pm (which is weird time and day so I didn't have to wait), but I was surprised to see 8 tables filled. I can't imagine how packed the restaurant must be on the weekends during dinner.  SERVICE The service was quick and the workers were very nice, which stands out compared to other KBBQ restaurants. The staff was very attentive and quick to bring out our orders.   SIDES The menu has a lot of different sides and meats, which is a great option for people that want to explore Korean BBQ.   I recommend getting the soybean paste soup with a side of rice! The stew complements the meat very well. The padak (Korean No. 1 Fried Chicken) was okay. The chicken was pretty juicy, but it isn't your typical padak where the fried chicken is paired with green onion and ponzu sauce. Instead, it came with a mayo-based sauce, lettuce, and bits of green onion. The Hwaro Rice was just an underwhelming bibimbap to be completely honest. It was just a bowl of rice with bean sprouts, seaweed salad, kimchi, lettuce, topped with an egg and gochujang sauce. The green onion and bean sprout salad was also another side not worth ordering.   MEAT My go-to slice of meat is the beef brisket, and it was pretty good. Most slices had a good ratio of meat to fat (around 70% meat to 30% fat, while some were about half meat, half fat). A good KBBQ restaurant will serve you brisket with more meat than fat! The brisket tastes really good when you wrap it in some salad, ssamjang (Korean soybean paste), pickled radish and jalapeno, and rice paper.  The Hwaro premium steak was okay. There wasn't anything particularly good or bad about the meat, but the portion was pretty big, despite being pretty thin.  DESSERT For dessert, we had the Affogato with green tea ice cream, topped with corn flakes.   VIBE I see why people enjoy eating here, even if the food is just okay. It's because of the upbeat atmosphere. They play popular, upbeat KPOP music, and it seems like a restaurant that groups would come to on the weekend to eat, drink, relax.   For $22.99 per person (all day), the food and service were pretty good. I'm not sure if I would go out of my way to eat here, but it seems like a fun place to eat with friends on the weekend.",

    "text": "There's just something fun and primal about grilling your own meat.  Amuse bouche forget it.  Watch the slabs of marbled beef hissing atop the grill.  Your mouth will begin to water.  Even if this is not happening at your table.  You merely just peak in and walk through the door as you see all the tables full.  Then, wait in line for this tantalizing experience, the aroma alone will wet your appetite.  In addition to that, Korean barbecue's natural pairing to beer-and-soju makes it hard to beat.   Its easy to see why this has become the well deserved meal you crave when your ravenously hungry.  When Korean BBQ is top of mind, the locals head straight to Koreatown to the-ever-so-popular Hwaro, a restaurant packed with devotees of Korean-style BBQ.     It's casual, street-style ambiance and parade of tasty meats, allows  Hwaro to continue to deliver one of the most visited KBBQ experiences off the strip.  Affordable at $22.95 per person, this all you-can-eat Korean dining chow down is the place to visit. The banchan or small side dishes/accompaniments, and appetizers (selected by you) served at the beginning of the meal sets the tone while the namesake \"spicy beef\" short ribs is the go-to order.  Pineapple juice sweetens and tenderizes beef short ribs in this classic Korean grilled dish.  The tantalizing smell of sizzling spicy pork is the next best thing!  It will surely tempt you to keep the orders coming.    Their meat cutter can cut meat so thinly you can read a magazine through it and the bone-in short ribs are cut masterfully crosswise to keep up with the never-ending demand.    This is a small but, comfortable, spot, where meals are grilled tableside. Indulge in it all, because you choose from the menu what your craving, and until content.  The menu has an array of choices and various cuts ranging from soft and succulent pork belly to thin bacon cuts cooked to a soft chewiness or satisfying crunch. When you do your own cooking, it's all up to you!  The \"shake shake\" a  signature dish  arrives in a tin that was meant to be covered and shaken to mix.  The base ingredient is thick, spicy-sweet paste - a combination of doenjang (fermented bean paste) and gochujang (Korean red pepper paste).  Normally this paste would be used primarily to glaze barbecued meats or as a condiment for lettuce wraps, it can also be a dip for cold vegetables like carrots, cucumber, or peppers.   These meats are mouthwatering deliciousness.  Paired with the vegetable side dishes, beer & other fun beverages, it's hard to beat the fun you can have with the right group of friends or family! It is always best enjoyed in groups.  Korean recipes are often accompanied by kimchi, a spicy fermented vegetable dish mostly consisting of cucumbers, cabbage and other root vegetables marinated in a spicy chili seasoning.    KBBQ is a unique experience where cooking and eating take center stage.  The meat being the star of the show!    Jal meokgesseumnida",

Cook your own food KBBQ with good portions for my 3-party Valentine's dates. we waited about an hour for dinner, which is pretty standard for KBBQ at most places.  Bonchon was ok. Steam egg was one per table. I liked the potato salad. Bulgogi nachos were more like bulgogi on top of the last chips in the bag aka the small broken parts. Cheese corn was too small: AND they had onions in there, which I really hate. Considering the cheese corn was a small portion, it took quite some time to cook/melt. I will give it to Hwaro for their dessert. The affogato with cereal on top was suuuupppperrrrrr yummy. Prolly my favorite dessert at any KBBQ spot.  Like most other KBBQ places, it's small and crowded. The vents above the grills SUCK. So, you come out of there smelling like KBBQ -- not the worst smell in the world lol  I would come here again (if Hobak was closed) lol",

Only because with each time I learned something new and liked the taste a whole lot better. My coworkers always wanted to come here often because of the price. The late night is like $20 and the all day special is $23. I swear it used to be cheaper but who knows. They usually have rice paper but last night they ran out. The steamed egg is one order per TABLE and not person (which sucks). The meat quality is pretty good though. Not top notch, but so-so for what you're paying. They're pretty busy but service goes quickly. I really like the tall guy, he's super nice always changes the grill when needed. I don't really like their sides as much as other places, but I like the sauce that they have for dipping.",

The service was great, the food was amazing and the drinks were equally up to par. I really enjoyed their jalapeno beef belly. Must try! I also liked that they offer ice cream at the end, as I find, most ayce Korean places do not offer desert with the meal price. I will also say all of their cuts of meat are high quality and they don't skimp out on sides and sauces. I really enjoyed the garlic butter. I'm so happy I got this recommendation from a local because I wanna as not steered wrong. There is no way I would come visit Vegas again and not bring all my friend here.  I will say my one tip is to wear comfortable clothing as sitting for a while in a room radiating all that heat can get a little sticky. But, I promise the food is so worth it you will not fret over anything else.",

The only reason why I took 1 star off is because some of their all day special menu you can only get one piece. So that's a bummer.

They have this late night special for $20 after 10pm and military/government discount which is something you cannot pass over and instantly made me already like this place! I grew up in the 626 Los Angeles area and have tried multiple Korean bbq areas in ktown so coming to a Korean bbq in an area not known for Korean bbq...my expectations were not very high. Also to note the last time I ate Korean bbq I got food poisoning so I really doubted even going to another one. However that being said, Hwaro blew away all of me and my family's expectations. The side dishes were really fresh, meat selection had more than enough to choose from (pork cheek usually is not on my \"to eat\" list but somehow it was here!!!), corn cheese was super bomb that I ended up ordering like 6 lol, and did I mention they have vanilla/green tea/strawberry ice cream?! The ice cream actually pushed me to write this review because I really dislike green tea ice cream in general and strawberry is my favorite flavor, so you can imagine my face when I didn't even notice the desert options until the end! If I ever come back to Vegas again this will be a regular stop for me. Also our server was Yvette, she was super cute and also very attentive in switching out the grills and taking our reorders. I'm sure the rest of the staff is just as good from what I've read on yelp, so pair that with the excellent food experience and you get 5 stars!",

It's certainly a different taste than others I've tried as its more mild, but I enjoy it. They gave us plenty for our table of 7 and were quick to resupply.   Roughly 50 cuts of meat and seafood are available,  and although I stuck with mostly the beef dishes I didn't find any problems with them. \"The S**t\" is surprisingly good too, give it a shot.   The staff was must accommodating,  too, but I won't go into the details on that one ;). Excellent service,  we thank you once again!",

    "text": "My food prayers have been answered! There's a new KBBQ place in town and for $19.99 AYCE dinner. Heck yeah! The couple my husband and I usually dine with decided to go for lunch. Lunch is $16.99 but for $3 extra per person, we decided to splurge (LOL) and get the dinner AYCE. We looked at the menu and when we ordered, we discovered that one of our menus had tape over some of the items to indicate they were no longer available. The BOGO free beer was a tease, no free desserts included & no green tea smoked pork belly. :( This is minor but they were out of Hite beer but they had Cass beer. I know some of my peeps might care about that so I thought I would mention that.  It's your standard AYCE KBBQ place, you start off with sangchu geotjeori (Korean lettuce salad), a wide assortment of banchan (side dishes), sauces & sides for your meat-sesame oil dip, spicy chili dip, ssamjang, garlic cloves, and jalapenos. Looking at other photos from people who have went before me, I was disappointed to not get the some of my favorite banchan. In one of the photos, they received more banchan. They don't usually include corn cheese but I didn't get that either!! WTF!  Meats: Our group ordered the brisket, pork belly, short ribs, flank steak, bulgogi, and baby octopus (they were out of baby octopus so they substituted it with squid which was fine with us). No major complaints. Good enough. The chadol and pork belly were thick and good. Galbi was my least favorite.  Also included was your typical doenjang chigae (fermented soybean paste stew). It had a good flavor but it was missing tofu. I don't remember having this stew without tofu. The gyeran jjim (steamed egg casserole) was terrible! No scallions, it was bland, and had a burnt aftertaste.  Service could be better. She didn't ask if we wanted more banchan nor helped us with the meat (not that I need it but it's nice when they do). Overall, it's still a steal for $20 when the other KBBQ places in this town charge $25-$33. I was disappointed to not get a lot of the items in the photos but can't really complain too much when it's $19.99.",

My one complaint is that it was way too loud. I had to yell at my husband sitting next to me about everything, and it was near impossible to talk to the person in front of you. My party was large and we had 10 people. They waiters seemed overwhelmed and my family just cooked, it's OK though, we're Korean. The sides were really good. The meat was good, not the highest highest quality but $20 ayce? You just can't beat it. Be prepared to order quick, and do not over order as they will charge you!",

The hostess comes out and calls my name, I said \"right here\" loud enough for other people to see also. The hostess seated TWO parties way further down the list. When I asked what was up, she straight up said \"well you didn't say anything\". Had I not asked her, she would have proceeded to continue skipping over us. Not to mention, she had been calling out names the entire night to see who was all waiting still. So she had seen and called me twice prior to this.   Food was good. Service sucked hard. Put a bad taste in my mouth to begin with so I didn't get to enjoy it as much as I wanted to.",

We arrived on a Friday night at dinner time without a reservation and had to add our name to the waiting list. For 2 hours we sat outside because I had read other reviews and really wanted to try Hwaro. We were only in town for 2 days and since we live in MS where there are NO Korean restaurants, I needed my kbbq fix.  Once we were seated the server brought out menus and banchan really quickly. A beautiful selection of savory, sweet, salty, crunchy sides to compliment quite a large variety of meats to grill. We opted for the 20.95 \"All Day\" menu. Choose from anything off the menu except two categories. Amazing. The doenjjang jigge is a must-try and even better than some that I've had in Korea. The steamed egg was silky smooth and fluffy. They are generous with the meat and changed the grill out often to prevent it from sticking/burning. Over all, the staff was very attentive and I could tell that they want their customers to have the best experience. I haven't tried any other Korean restaurants in the area but I think I'll stick with Hwaro when I come back.",

The space is small, there were maybe... 8 tables that sit 4/5 people, and 2 large tables for larger parties. We had a party of 4 and the wait was ~30-45 min. Definitely wouldn't come here with a huge party. The 2 older korean women who were the hosts and likely the owners weren't the friendliest, either.   Service was pretty terrible. We had to ask numerous times for some of our orders.   Would I come here again? ehhh.. for the long wait time, subpar quality of meats, and poor service- I'm hesitant. It's saving grace is the fact that it's $20 and has such a large selection of items on the menu.",

    "text": "The price is right! $19.99 AYCE Korean BBQ that has a great selection of ban chan (side dishes) and a decent selection of meats.    Meats by ranking: Short rib - really tender Hwaro (thin) pork belly Rib eye Spicy chicken Pork belly Brisket Flank steak Pork skin (probably pass next time) Tripe (aka intestine) - also pass  Ban chan: Cheesy corn - I don't know of any other Vegas kbbq places with this side Korean spicy rice cake Steamed egg Picked radish, cucumbers Dried fish Chap chae Veggie Korean pancake Broccoli with creamy sauce  Based on the photos, the ban chan must change daily. I was sad to see that there were no bean sprouts or fish cake today :( I was also hoping they would have the Korean rice paper since no Vegas establishment seems to carry this side.  Negatives: limited seafood options, but what can you really expect for the price. Also as mentioned previously, no beef tongue...which is usually a fan favorite. I would suggest having different prices for additional offerings like most Cali places offer in case you want to upgrade. We were offered two grills for seven people but it would have been an awkward setup. Their larger tables for 8 only have one grill.  Positive - the service was excellent and very attentive. I like that they allow half orders so you can sample the items that you are unsure about. They have no limitations on how many orders of short rib per table. Most of the time the meat was cooked and cut for us.  The grills were changed at least 5-6 times.  Overall for the price, service, and quality of food, will definitely be back.  I have a feeling that prices will probably increase with time as other establishments have, so come get it while you can!",

    "text": "Couldn't wait for the long line at Caesar's buffet. Thought we give this ACYE a try.   Food - average. Flavor is not bad but can be better.   Short rib - definitely can use more flavor. It's cut too thick. Average quality.   Beef belly - pretty good. A bit fatty.   Brisket - my least favorite. Quality is ehh.   Fat ass (yes, that's the name) - it's basically a very fatty thick cut pork belly marinated in a wine sauce. Kinda bland. Very fatty. Ehh.   Steam eggs - complimentary. We ordered this when we ordered our food but they must have forgotten. We had to ask mid way through our dinner n didn't receive it till all of our food was cooked. Would have loved this to help balance our fatty meal. Flavor was good. Very eggy. Egg ratio was higher than the broth.   Banchan - ehh. Very average. U get about 8 or so banchan with ur meal + a salad. Soy bean soup is also included but we never got ours.   Cleanliness - yikes. This is where we had a problem. We sat at the corner table. There was a live roach flipped on its back with the legs still moving. Strike 1. Went to the ladies room to freshen up before our meal. There was another roach (see photo)!! Strike 2. Hence the 2 stars. Against our better judgement we still ate here!! We were staving. Don't judge me.   Service - we were basically served by one guy the whole time. I think his name is Angover. Yes, it sounds like hangover which is why we remembered the name.  He was very attentive n made sure to check on us even though we were dumped in a corner like a bad habit by the elder Korean lady (there were other tables available when we arrived). He also seemed to be the only one working hard.   Overall food was ok. Service was great. We're so spoiled by all the amazing ACYE back in LA.   Happy wasting ur money on mediocre KBBQ!!",

    "text": "Came here for dinner after watching a movie with friends. Wanted to check it out since it was new and their icon is the maplestory pig XD (wonder who noticed?). Their prices are ok. $19.99 for AYCE dinner. $16.99 for AYCE lunch. Choice of 4 unmarinated items, 4 marinated items, then 6 more items available for dinner. Not much of a selection   As for side dishes, for us, we got 12 side dishes on top of a steamed egg, a soup, and a cheese corn... and the usual salad.. i was like oOo XD   So for the meats...  Plain - pork belly (usual thick cut pork belly), hwaro pork belly (same pork belly but thinner.. like 1/2 - 1/3 of the usual thickness, brisket (usual), and \"tripe\". Why i put quotation marks on tripe is because from the usual either honeycomb or the one with the layers, .... it was neither.. and was given a long piece of intestine.... wot? thats not even tripe D: no where on the menu says intestine so i guess mis-translation somewhere? Lol (super chewy btw)   Marinate - marinated sliced ribeye (bulgolgi), sweet & spicy pork, boneless marinated chicken, and pork skin. Pork skin was not what i expected. yeah its pork skin but im not too sure how to cook it. it softened up by cooking but it became gelatinous? i couldnt make it crispy cuz the grill made the skin carmelize XD   Dinner - baby octopus, short ribs (not that marinated, which is fine by me), pork shoulder butt, marinate pork ribs, spicy baby back ribs, beef sirloin of flank (what..? isnt sirloin and flank two different cuts/areas) with soy sauce.   The aformentioned green tea smoked pork belly and dessert menu is now covered and not available for AYCE.   not much of a fan of the place. service was a bit lacking on the ordering and water filling. they went to the korean tables like 3x before us once...starting to remind me of another pig restaurant... XD   its nice they renovated this place and made it live again from the old place but WHY YOU NO GIVE ME BEEF TONGUE :( i missed it during this meal.. .",

Once they sat us, I understood why they made us wait, the table was already prepared with all the side dishes and sauces (about 10 of them) plus a pint of water for each of us and that was a pleasant surprise.  Overall, there are 52 all you can eat choices in the menu for $20.95 which is a lot to select from for a very reasonable price.  The food was great tasting, the service was impeccable as we were very well attended, and they answered all our questions.

Both were really flavorful and appetizing. The only thing I didn't like was the ice cream at the end of the meal which tasted artificial and wasn't creamy enough. BUT I don't go here for the ice cream, so can't complain!  The server also charged us the all day price of $19.99 instead of the $16.99 (we didn't order any of the all day meats). But they were quick to change it and apologetic when we pointed it out.  Awesome place to eat while in Vegas - just don't mind if you smell like KBBQ for the rest of the day!",

    "text": "Was there last night 3/17/18 with a party of 4.  There is a flat fee of $22.95 per person for all-you-can-eat, which you choose from a simple menu.  We paid $1.50 for each can soda and $10.50 for peach Soju.  You can order anything you want as many times as you like for 2 hours max, then they ask you to leave.  The best meat can only be ordered once per table, nonetheless, the portions are very generous, and the quality of the food is ok, but there are much better places in Las Vegas to have K-BBQ.  My 1 star rating is for the following reasons:    1.  Patrons who had just arrived, were allowed to skip the line and be seated ahead of others who like ourselves had been waiting for more than an hour; last time I checked, this is possible when you tip the guy controlling the waiting list....just saying.   2.  Our waitress was insufferable, when she felt we had been there long enough, not even an hour into our dining ,she came by our table every few minutes trying to turn-off our grille;  we clearly told her not to touch the controls but, in one occassion she succeeded, only to have to turn it back on because we still had plenty of meat grilling on the table.  She stood in front of our table looking at her wristwatch, like an angry mother waiting for her teenage kid to come home! Worst service ever! 3.  BE WARE:  15% TIP IS INCLUDED!  But no one tells you.  If you pay with a card, they will give you your transaction receipt, which does not show that the tip is included, on the contrary, it has the usual \"tip\" line.   Only when I asked and insisted in a detailed receipt is that I saw that the tip was included!!! 4.  Parking is very difficult to find, we had to park 1/2 a block away. 5.  The restaurant is extremely small, with practically no place to seat and wait, you must stand outside in the cold, like we did. 6.  Ventilation is none existent, and the smoke from the grilled meats will cling to you and your clothes, be prepared to leave the place smelling like a steak, so make this the last stop of your evening, unless you want every dog in the neighborhood to follow you home!",

We ordered the spicy pork bulgogi which was excellent, spicy pineapple beef which was also full of flavor. Our regular patterns of brisket and short ribs were delicious as well. The customer service here was excellent! People came over right away when we needed them and brought back the items we requested in an instant. The people that work here are very efficient because as soon as we stood to leave they were ready to clean to table and seat the neat party within minutes. I will definitely come back here again because of the excellent service and the marinated meats full of delicious flavor!",

I've tried squid at multiple Korean BBQ places and the quality at other places can't compare since they're usually tough/chewy but not here. The wait can get pretty long but it's worth it in my opinion. The meat is really good as well! I love the beef tongue here. The service varies. Sometimes it's really good and sometimes it's pretty bad so 4 stars for that. The food is good so I'd definitely recommend coming here.",

The bad review is primarily for the fact that our server told us we couldn't cut and eat the cake we brought for my cousins birthday. I'm not sure if their rules have changed, outside food is not allowed which is expected amongst almost all restaurants with the exceptions of cake for celebrations. The last time we visited was just a few months prior for another family members  birthday and our server even brought us out a lighter, extra plates, and a knife to cut her cake. Yesterday when we entered we brought a nothing but bundt cake and no one stated we couldn't have it until the very end when we asked if we could have extra plates for the birthday cake. Our server said no bc outside food was not allowed, we even told her we've been here before and that has never been a problem. Then she said we could blow out the candles but the cake must be consumed out of the restaurant. Other than this ordeal everything else was great food and all the other employees we came across during our visit. I guess just don't bother coming in for celebrations, I know we definitely won't anymore.",

Yes, wait can get a bit long during peak hours/days, but I'd say that's to be expected if you go during commonly busy times. I think Hwaro has a good amount of options of meats and appetizers/sides for the pricing, whether you get the late night/lunch or all day special. The meats are good quality, and I feel like overall quality is pretty consistent. The servers are usually pretty attentive and accommodating when it comes to things like grill changes/adjustments and ordering more. They've also been very helpful in answering questions, and allowing smaller or half orders of meats we wanted to try for the first time. I usually order spicy pork bulgogi, regular bulgogi, short ribs, brisket, The Shit, and cheese corn. Then from there I decide where I want to switch things up. The bulgogi meats are my favorites since they're usually really tender and flavorful. Just be mindful with the spicy pork bulgogi, as the marinade can make the grill char/smoke more quickly.  Although I haven't made it through the whole menu yet, I'm definitely getting there. Definitely one of my go-to/favorite all you can eat KBBQ places in Vegas!",

The service we got on both days was mediocre at best. I wanted to give them the benefit of the doubt the first time. Maybe they were just really busy and not accustomed to handling a busy floor? Second time around was the same thing. We had to flag down multiple servers to be noticed. The second time was actually worse than the first time. I'm not sure if it was because they knew we were a larger party and we would automatically be charged gratuity? Not sure.   The first time I came they didn't have the gyoza and green mussels, but was not too hung up over that--they ran out of stuff sometimes right? Second time I came, they had both, but only the guoza ever came. I asked a couple times for mussels, but just gave up because it never came.   I am only giving it 3 stars because they had some unique options that other Kbbq places didn't have such as their Spicy Jalapeno Beef Belly--my personal favorite. They also had a seafood salad (which was something I only expected at a sushi restaurant), as well as bulgogi nachos.   I wish I could love it as much as all the others that rave on about it, but it's definitely a lot more expensive than kbbq places like GEN that cost less and have just as many options, but with better service. Not sure if I'll return.",

For the side dishes, I appreciate how they offer more than your basic kimchi and fish cake; my favorites are the rice paper, pa muchim (scallion salad), and picked radish. For appetizers, they have interesting stuff like cheese fondue to dip your various meats in, bulgogi nachos, bean paste soup, steamed egg, and shake shake rice. Most importantly, they serve quality (I repeat QUALITY) meat for an AYCE place. I recommend the beef tongue (don't hate it until you try it), short ribs, brisket, red wine pork belly, and enoki beef. Also, they give you green tea ice cream or affogato style vanilla ice cream for dessert.   CONS The service is hit or miss. They are always busy and the servers are usually quick, refill your water before it's empty, all that other good stuff, but there have been times where I question if my server have forgotten about our table.   OVERALL You can't be mad about delicious, AYCE, family style kbbq with cute korean decor/atmosphere. I come here at least once a month, and more when I have an excuse to celebrate something lol.",

Aside from the good quality of food they serve, customer service made me give them 4 stars. Could have been 5 stars if the dessert is unlimited or they have additional dessert choices but that is just my opinion. It was a great korean bbq experience at Hwaro. No wonder why people keep coming there. I guess they will be busy from opening till closing. Good food plus good customer service.   I will definitely be back with our visiting relatives and friends. They will surely enjoy it too!",

Got here around 1230a, last call is at 2.  Party of 4 took about 10 minutes to be sat because there was quite an amount of peeps here.  For appetizers we got The Shit, Padak, and Steamed Egg.  These were a part of the AYCE.  We ordered various meats that came to our table fast.  The service here was really straight to the point, i love it.  The meats were really good.  We got brisket, tongue, kalbi bone in, garlic jalapeno belly, premium steak, and other meats that I didnt know about.  We lasted about only 2 rounds. Sad lol.  But i enjoyed my experience. We also got the affogato ice cream.  Wish it had more affogato in it but thats okay it was good.  The music here was lit. Couldnt stop dancing in my chair. LOL.",

I like the electronic check in, but like everywhere else, you can't check in until you get here.  Then the entire party needs to be here before you are seated.  Skirt steak is always a winner. We ordered four to start and it came with two strips.  Then I asked for two more order and two more strips came out.  Egh?...  Brisket is my go to and I started with four orders and they brought a plate full.  I asked for two order later and they brought the same amount as before. I'm starting to think it's always a plate regardless.  I just never noticed until yesterday.  Garlic butter melts in about 10 minutes and is a great dipping sauce for any meat.    Hwaro spicy rib steak had a nice marinade.  Not sure what's in it, but it had a sweet and spicy taste.  KFC - is a good starter if you like bite size fried chicken.  Pork belly, more please!  What I learned, order two plates of brisket to start if you like brisket, then order everything else by the strip or pieces to avoid misunderstanding.    So get out their and eat up!",

    "text": "Finally tried this place out after a couple of Yelpers had recommended this place.  I came with my mom, auntie and uncle and we arrived around 12:15pm on a weekday.  The place was packed already!  We had to wait about 25 minutes for a table.  My family is use to going to Sura BBQ and that place is pretty big so they weren't use to the smaller environment.   Omgoodness my mom really is getting old bcs she complained about everything at Hwaro.  She complained that the noise level was too much (they were playing kpop), the tofu soup was too salty, the rice undercooked, them having no knives (although I saw the server give a knife to another table...??), the heating element wasn't strong enough... I don't think I'm gonna take my mom anywhere anymore.   For me, I enjoyed my meal minus having to listen to my mom whine.  I liked how they had ice water bottles at the table for you to pour your own water.  They also leave the sauce container for the table.  Those little things make a difference bcs I don't have to wait for a server to obtain those items.    We ordered the all day special bcs I wanted to try the enoki beef and my mom wanted the premium steak.  I also wanted beef tongue.  We ordered a bunch of red meats, red wine pork belly along with the squid and baby octopus.  Also the kfc, seafood salad, bean sprouts, steamed egg, cheese corn, garlic butter and the tofu soup.    The seafood salad was very good, light fresh and 1 of the many limited seafood items they have here.  The KFC was fantastic!  It was juicy, tender and quite tasty.  Bean sprout salad had more green onions than sprouts, steamed egg was good - would have liked more to share for a table of 4 ppl (only 1 order allowed per table), tofu soup as my mom said, was too salty.  The fish cake was good, radish could use more vinegar, potato salad was surprisedly really good but also really filling.  All the meats were good, but the winner of it all was the squid!  It is marinated beautifully and we couldn't stop eating it!   We sat at one of the middle tables so the wooden bench got uncomfortable after 30 mins.  The decor of the cherry blossom tree by the front of the restaurant brings life and a bit of cheeriness to the dark wooden themed restaurant.    My mom was also disappointed that there wasn't more desserts available like pumpkin soup, red bean soup... bcs Sura has that... I thought the affogato hit the spot. It did take them 10 mins to get it out to us but then again it seemed like the whole restaurant was waiting on dessert.    My mom doesn't want to come back bcs she thinks Hwaro is \"too hip\" and trendy - she said \"its for the young ppl\"... I liked it.  I'll be back minus my mom, that's for sure.  Can't take her nowhere :/   They also added 15% gratuity bcs we were a party of 4, which made it easy when we were paying the bill, no need to bust out the calculator.  Ohh and PULL HARD for the front door, that thing is heavy!",

We had garlic butter and cheese with corn as dips - I prefer the cheese over the butter.  Service was good as our waitress was pleasant and knowledgeable. The wait was about 20 min. The service could have been a bit quicker because I had to leave for my flight and we waited 10 minutes for our dessert but had to leave before getting any.

    "text": "Visited this AYCE Korean BBQ for lunch with a group of 6 during our time in Las Vegas. It was maybe at most a 20 minute drive from the strip, but it seemed like a pretty popular spot since there was still a bit of a wait near the end of lunch time (around 3pm).  We didn't wait terribly long, roughly 20 minutes, and they take names and call you when your table is ready. Luckily for us, it's also located in the same complex next to a Kung Fu Tea, where undoubtedly many others go to grab bubble tea beforehand while waiting to gorge themselves on meat. Maybe it was just us.  The variety of options was great for the price with ice cream included at the end too! They have nice options for side dishes to go with your meat that includes steamed egg amongst the typical ban chan like kimchi, radish kimchi, and cucumber.  Service was attentive and we were able to enjoy our meal and head out in a decent amount of time. My group of friends and I are from NYC where AYCE Korean barbeque places are few and far between with extravagant pricing (as much as you'd end up paying for Bacchanal Buffer) so this was a steal for us.",

    "text": "One of our favorite Korean bbq places. We've been here a few times and our last visit was during Mother's Day. (Wife LOVES Korean bbq).  Place is always pretty busy so plan to wait a little. On such a busy day we only waited about 20 minutes which isn't bad at all for Mother's Day!  We always get one of the combo meals and we order spicy cold noodles (wife's favorite dish) and a soft tofu soup (one of my favorite soup). The combo with the extras is enough for our family of 3, us two and 7yr old son. When we have our daughter with us we usually have to order a bit more because the amount of meat is on the smaller side. They do serve soup, egg, salad and other sides with the combo  dinner but the portions of the meats are not that much. I'd say about 3-4 oz of meat per selection prior to cooking.  The staff has always been super attentive and actually handle the bbq for you!  To some it might be burdensome having a server at your table reaching over attending the meat on the grill but to us it's just part of the experience. They will let you handle the bbq yourself if you wish so that's not an issue.  The combo also comes with some veggies to roast and a cool icecream dessert.   For Mother's Day, wifey got a ride and a coupon for our next visit.   4 stars only due to the amount of meat served with each combo. It can be slightly bigger for the price point. Yes it's good quality meat and good cuts of meat but 1-2 more ounces won't hurt.",

I can never fully cheat on Mr. Bbq in Fullerton, hence Hwaro gets 4 stars but its also because I think service could be better and pricing is a little high. Besides that, the meat quality is great and the banchan is yummy. Something else I like is that they have dipping sauce other than just salt and oil.  Cute decor too!",

Decided to order more food, the food was never delivered to us. At that point could not help myself but say something, i told the server how poor their service is. She came back with the check and proudly addressed \"as a courtesy i took this off your check\" guess... A $1.50 soda was taken out of the check! -- first of all when i tell someone how bad your service is, that doesn't mean i am out to get anything for free! I take my family out to enjoy our meal and not to get something for free! Take guests comments to improve your service! This is our first and last time in this place.

The service was impeccable as our server, Jayden, was very mindful of our needs such as when we wanted to order more food, needed drink refills and when we needed the grill changed.

That seems to be the general attitude in a lot of the restaurants in China Town.   We ordered:  Marinated Sliced Ribeye Sweet & Spicy Pork  Pork Belly Enoki Beef Act Like Korean  First off, there was just two of us. It was WAY too much food. We ate the majority of it, but we were INSANELY full. I had to unbutton AND unzip my pants. But, this was all good meat. It's not like this crazy high quality of meat, but it's well worth the $20 you spend.   Best part - it is super fun to cook your own meat to get it to your liking. This is a perfect place for a date night if you're both looking for something new and fun. WARNING: you will smell like you've been grilling meat all night. And you WILL smell of garlic. Some people dig it.",

I noticed if you go with 4 or less people you get seated a little faster. If you go with a big party I recommend going before 6pm if possible.  Before you get seated  water and the side kimchi are already on the table with the bomb salad. Few things we ordered and were really good.   Bulgogi, kalbi, pork belly, gyoza, brisket, rice paper, steamed egg and the best  meat of the night. prime steak!!! For desert we had this ice cream coffee thing (BOMB)!!!! The service was awesome. Multiple people that worked here came to our table and asked if we are ok. I felt really appreciated. They changed the grill multiple times, I think changing the grill is a must so you can taste all the different meats they have... oh and the food was amazing!!!! This is my new best ayce Korean BBQ.",

I recommend the red wine and green tea pork belly, brisket, bulgogi, squid, baby octopus, sliced ribeye, skirt steak, green mussels, and spicy pineapple steak! \"The Shit\" appetizer is great too, it's similar to an appetizer by the same name I've had at sushi restaurants like Sakana. The affogato dessert (sweet coffee and ice cream) is amazing too! That's the first time I've had it with corn flakes and it seemed strange at first but it added a nice crunch. There's still quite a few items on the menu I've yet to try but I'd like to during my next visit.",

Well, if you were expecting amazing or even good cuts of meat at this price you were in fact dreaming with me.  Hwaro is the place to go if you're looking to fill up on Korean BBQ, are on a budget, and love to smell like you just hung out at a Korean campfire for the rest of the night. I'm really not going to hate on Hwaro that much. As is often the case, you seriously get exactly what you pay for here...maybe even a little more. You're paying for a bunch of cheap cuts of meat and tasty sauces, resulting in what some will appreciate, but what I find a waste.   I am certainly biased. I try to limit my intake of meat products and seldomly splurge on AYCE. But even if I'm eating meat, I find it far more enjoyable to spend more on better quality.   If you do come here give yourself extra time to park in this cash cow food plaza, or come off peak hours, which may be a good idea anyway--the staff was very friendly, but had a difficult time keeping up with the tables. The banchan sides were ample, but nothing special.  ...and in the end, the love you take Is equal to the love you make",

Of course, it depends on what you order and how you cook your meats. If you are craving a ton of protein, this is the place to load up. My favorite is the flank steak and I loved all the small side dishes to accent the flavors. I ate and ate until I was about to burst. Definitely go for the lunch buffet, its a bargain.

So being that I have not had yakiniku for several months I was starting to get desperate to find one ASAP.Went on Yelp! and found this place was near by so I decided to give it a try. Overall a good experience. Food was good and the banchan was good as well. Customer service could have been better (our waters were never filled, never came to check on us unless we waved him down, etc.) Would this be the first place I'd recommend to people? not necessarily. BUT if you're just looking to find somewhere to \"get the job done\" then this place will do that.",

I came here on a Saturday night around 11pm and only had to wait about 15 minutes for a table.  We chose the AYCE option for $16.99 - what a great deal!  They had a variety of choices to choose from, we tried the normal beef brisket, pork belly, spicy pork belly, a few of the marinated meats.  The service was pretty good.  We also ordered the tofu soup, which if I could redo that... I would stick with the meat instead.  You can still order the bean paste soup and steamed egg that comes with it, so it was pretty good deal! I'll probably be back here next time I'm in Vegas craving some Korean bbq.",

Everything we tried was very good, especially the wine marinated pork belly. They give you a lot of sides as well, and their spicy salad is very comparable to other KBBQ's in the area.  Service: Now this stands out. You will always have someone coming by every few minutes to check on you and make sure you are having a good time. You don't get this at most places, all you get is just a blank nod and the check when you aren't even halfway done.   Parking kind of sucks, especially on peak times, but that's to be expected. Be prepared for dropped suspension neon 1995 Honda's with mufflers the size of a bowling balls roaring here and there though. ;)",

Walked in around 4:45pm, put our name down and sat there waiting with another couple who was there before us. Restaurant was not busy at all and there was a few empty table. Waited and waited, saw a few worker came back and forth behind the counter and no one acknowledge us.  Waited again for another few minutes and still no one greeted us or letting us know how long it's going to be. We waited a few more minutes finally a guy with a black shirt picked up the clip board and looked at it, walked away and said to another co-worker \"there's 4 people, I don't know what to do?\" I was shocked from what he said. At this point still no greeting or acknowledgement.  My husband and I finally decided to get up and leave.  We have no problem waiting especially during shift change and everything but not even a greeting or acknowledging your guests that's a big no no.",

    "text": "I used to eat here before and I used to be happy bringing all my friends here to try a new kbbq spot.   As soon as we sat down, we ordered all the meat cause we were hungry. We only ordered beef tongue and brisket to start. We had no idea it would take 25 minutes to bring out 2 plates of raw meat. We were fine for the first 15 minutes cause we had the small side dishes, but after that we had to say something to the waiters. They didn't bring it out for another 10 minutes. By then, the rice was already cold and the grill was so hot that the meat literally cooked in less than 10 seconds and stuck to the grill. It was like eating ground beef. It was one of my friend's first time, and she got so pissed that she left after one bite. Not to mention she asked for more sides when we asked about the meat, and they haven't even brought it out even after she left.  So we decided to order more meat. We asked to triple the last order and add pork and bulgogi  because we were a group of 6 (now 5). So we waited another 20 minutes. They gave us less meat than the first order?!?!? I was pissed. Sitting there for almost 50 minutes and they only took our meat orders twice and gave us less meat when we asked for more. I decided to complain to the manager. Never have I ever had that bad of an experience at kbbq. Most places may take a while to refill waters but they're usually quick with the meat. This place took forever to refill and bring out raw meat. How hard is it to bring out raw meat? They don't even cook it.  Then the waiter comes back and apologizes. Homeboy said \"sorry I was lazy before but now I changed cause yea\" we all looked at each other like wtf? Who says that? After that they were quicker on bringing out the meat. But by the third time we made our order it was already over an hour of sitting there munching on the sides and we were getting full. But we ordered a lot more just so we can try to get somewhat of our money's worth. We asked for double of 4 different meats. They still gave us less than the single order. They were a little quicker this time but it still took 10 minutes to bring out.   The waiter came back again and didn't even apologize. He made an excuse. He said the other table made a reservation so they were busier accommodating them. Wtf does having a reservation have anything to do with service? We waited like 20 minutes outside prior to eating. I guess you should make a reservation next time so they treat you better. Then he said we can't discount anything but we can give you free soda. Wtf is free soda gonna do? We were just fed up and asked for the check.  They charged us for 6 orders, even though it was only 5 of us eating cause our friend left before the meat came because the service was that horrible. They have some nerve adding auto gratuity for shitty service, I had to say something again.  I've eaten here multiple times and i usually am pleased with the experience. I don't know if it was because it was all guys working but they suck. Just standing around with their dick in their hands doing nothing and admitting to being lazy.",

(Even the side dishes were all good ANDDD plentiful) The only reason for it being four stars was because their menu is fairly small and their brisket sauce definitely needed more salt. Other than that, as long as I ask for a side of salt everytime I sit down, I will continue going to this place! :)",

I'm not saying the service is bad but I think it may have been super because they wanted us out of there. The restaurant is small and we took up a large chunk.   What I loved: Quality of the meat was great Flavor of the marinated meats like spicy pork was really nice and balanced.  They have garlic butter and little pots of cheese to get hot and melty, see photo.  Price, it's a great value.  I really appreciated unlike other places I've been it's a flat price, you see it you order it. No confusing tiers to flip back and forth though to check if the premium steak tier also includes pork belly...  They were fast and efficient with changing the grill and generous with the water refills.  The best part? When I got home my son hugged me and said \"mom, you smell like meat.\" Ah yes son, I sure do love me some Korean BBQ.",

The only but was that towards the end of our meal they told us there was a two hour wait rushing us to leave after paying and tipping. I have never been kicked out of a restaurant before and to be honest that was very rude when we were still enjoying our beer and good conversation. We were there for about an hour and half. I love this place but I probably won't be going again after this. Very disappointed.",

It's nice when they sit you and already have your kimchi sides and grill ready to go for you.",

Based off of the reviews we tried it out but it was subpar at most. The rice wasn't Korean rice, the portions we're tiny so you have to keep asking for the same meat. The pork belly was super thick, which is fine but definitely not old school koreans are used to. I would def recommend for younger groups but would not if you're with old school koreans aka parents and you're looking for some Korean food.",

Great quality meat and they have unique appetizers. It's a great value for all you can eat, but the service can be slow. When we were there, we noticed that there was really only 1-2 servers for all tables, and there was a long line of people waiting. Only come when you have time to spare.

They did all the ordering and I did all the EATING. From pork belly and brisket, to shake shake rice, don't forget to order rice paper on the side and try one their yummy alcoholic beverages too. AND GET THE SH!T. Get two orders for yourself, not one, cause you're gonna want more, trust me!   This place is always busy and the wait can be about 10-20 minutes since it's so small (they need to expand!!!!) Once you're seated, you have a variety of \"toppings\" and the circular stove is turned on. Containers of water are already waiting for you; now its just time to order the meats! Once your stove top gets too charred, someone will change it out for you.  The waiters have always been so sweet and very attentive!   It's a really cool experience if you've never had Korean BBQ before. Make sure to get the all you can eat. Brought my husband the second time and he absolutely loved it!!",

At this time in the night and due to the hangry-ness that was kicking in, we gave it a go anyhow and just hoped for the best.  Jayden was our server and he was poLite and extremeLy patient. I urged my man to just order an ish-Load of food and caLL it a night since we were given such a smaLL time constraint. Our server kindLy stepped in and mentioned that we were free to order whatever we wanted but there wouLd be a charge at the end with whatever food was Left over [keep this in mind peopLe].  The banchan came out first and aLthough everything was good, the fish cake (which is normaLLy my fave) was simpLy ok and there was no japchae offered [Boooooo!!!!].  That being said, the other foods that came out were AMAZING. Meats were weLL marinated and I didn't need any dipping sauces. The absoLute highLight of the night were the buLgogi and Korean ribs.   We'LL make a trip back, especiaLLy to try the Affogato ice cream with Korean coffee.  (We were bummed to find out that this item was incLuded in the \"Last CaLL\" notice too).

There's too many great restaurants in this plaza so give yourself plenty of time to find parking as well as wait time since it's a first come basis. Price is reasonable for an ayce bbq but the part that puts them over the top, the extras on the menu. Not only do you get the meats n the Korean side dishes, you get kfc (Korean fried chicken), there cheese fondue, shake shake box( rice,Kim chee, egg) soup, and so much more. They also have rice paper that I notice only Gen would have. The staff is amazing and quick with everything, very friendly.   So the reason I only gave 3 stars...we had to wait an hour half. I'm ok with that and that's normal on a busy night but I wasn't able to purchase soju while I wait!!! I always do this when I know the wait will be long. They don't allow it. Secondly (the main reason) while I was waiting I tragically witnessed the most disgusting way the staff cleans the tables. They used a dirty rag to wipe off the old food that was pulled out from his apron. And the another dirty rag to wipe the table again. Thank gosh I carry wet wipes with me to rewipe our table. Ok maybe that part was the worst part about this review.",

    "text": "UPDATE:  4/1/16: Went back last Friday and had a friend with me so I could \"qualify\" to sit at the Grill and do AYCE.  Noticed on the front door that they put up a sign saying that Grill and AYCE is for 2 or more persons, and even offering an apology if you don't meet this requirement.  To be fair, I've come across another Korean BBQ place that holds the same policy.  Once seated I noticed that they changed the grills from the rectangular ones that survived through 3 previous ownership changes, to the 14\" rounded types with holes on the outer perimeter.  I also noticed that they reduced the number of grill stations as well, so I can understand now why they are limiting the grills to parties of two or more.  Ordered the Bulgogi (it's labeled as \"ribeye\" on the menu) and the Kalbi Ribs.  I prefer LA Style Kalbi, but this place has the traditional cut.  I've posted pictures before of their beautiful presentation, but now it's just thrown in a metal bowl and served to you.  We actually ordered 2 bowls of Bulgogi because the portions are modest, which is okay since it'll prevent waste.  The Bulgogi was marinated nicely, but the Kalbi ribs were a bit too thick, and the meat a bit rubbery.  I ordered the brisket and it came nice a thin shaved.  I like Bibim Bap sauce on my brisket so they were nice enough to bring me some on the side.  My friend likes salt & pepper on his rice (don't ask, I didn't) and they actually brought a bowl of salt/pepper mix from the kitchen for him.  My friend wanted chicken, so we ordered the Dak Gui.  It was a disappointment, just two breasts that were butterfly cut, and no marinade, so I used the sesame oil and pepper sauce that was given on the side to try and infuse some flavor.  They also didn't provide any garlic as well.  Good thing I had the Bibim Bap sauce to give the chicken some kick.  I'm upgrading from the previous 2-star rating, but not returning the original 4-star rating.  The food has gone downhill.  There was no soup or egg souffle like last time, the bancha was limited (no cucumbers or anchiovis) and the Kalbi and Dak Gui were disappointments.  Also, the floors continue to be a problem, as they remain slippery like someone waxed the floors with a layer of Crisco, which makes rubber soled shoes as slippery as teflon.  The pricing is still great at $20 for AYCE dinner, so that'll keep bringing people in, but there are definitely better joints out there as far as quality goes.  UPDATE:  1/22/16:   Unfortunately Hwaro's ego has gotten too big for its own good.  Stepped in yesterday for a late lunch, and despite seeing 4 open grills, was told that I couldn't get a grill as they are for parties of 2 or more only.  Ok, so I asked if AYCE is still available at a non-grill station, and was told no.  Wow, took my business elsewhere (Trattoria Nakamura-Ya which was a far better choice) and will continue to do so until this place sees its 4th owner, which shouldn't be too long.  Once gave this place 4 Stars, but taking it down two notches since I received no service at all.  FIRST REVIEW:  5/19/15: Been eating Korean BBQ at this locale for over 8 years and 3 previous owners.  Just walking in and seeing the new decor gave this place some much needed style, decor, ambiance and personality.  The wait staff was very friendly, and the food came fresh to the table, prepared and presented excellenty from their owner/chef who was the Head Chef at the Shila(sp) Hotel in Korea.  Nestled in the Seoul Plaza, which is quickly becoming Tokyo Plaza with nearby big-hitters like Raku, Raku Sweets, Monta Ramen, Trattoria Nakamura-Ya and Kabuto Edomae Sushi residing with them, it's nice to know that there's an actual Korean joint that can hold it's own weight in this plaza of Yelp Celebrities.  Add this to the list of places I'll send my friends to.  If this inspires you at all to check out Hwaro, please tell Nali (which others also pronounce as Nari and Naughty) I said hello as she doesn't believe me when I told/promised her I would give them props on Yelp!",

We ultimately decided on Hwaro and holy crap I'm so happy we did. We hardly had to wait (maybe 10 min max) and we love how extensive Hwaro's menu is. I love that they have their lunch menu pricing available on weekends as well. We ended up paying the all-day price since we wanted the LA galbi, but it was worth it.   We ordered brisket, tongue, LA galbi, jalapeno garlic beef belly, a random ass steak, and lots more LA galbi. We also got their bean paste soup, onion salad, steamed egg, and some rice paper. We love ssamjang and were pleasantly surprised by how good the ssamjang was here. The place was crowded, but the servers were as attentive and friendly as they could be. The quality of meat is pretty decent (not the best, but far from the worst) and they listen if you want only a small portion or if you want to order a big portion.   For $30/person (this includes tax and tip), this was a pretty great deal. Next time I'll definitely try the shake shake rice.",

Price is really decent which you can get good quality of meat compare to other Korean bbq place in Las Vegas.  We got there after busy hour which we waited only 30min to get seated. Compare to LA Korean bbq service was way better here and also the server knows what they are doing. My server \"Tyler\" which he was our main server he took care of everything. Getting all the side dishes when they are about to be empty and changing grills everytime when we needed. We thought that \"Tyler\" was the manager at Hwaro which he took care of other tables with professional manners but he told us he was a just server. I'm going to definitely tell my friends from LA or here in Vegas to try out wonderful place \"Hwaro\" and our best server \"Tyler\".  Thank you for the great experience Hwaro.",

All you can eat is $23 bucks and you really can't find a better deal.  The quality of meat isn't as good as Hobak but what would one expect with it being all you can eat.  Everything we ordered was really good especially the beef belly & the short rib.  Their service is stupid fast, they come around and ask if you want more and it literally comes out within a couple minutes.    Their garlic butter is super good, especially after you let the garlic boil in the butter.  The texture is similar to like a soft potato LOL.    I'd definitely come here when I'm feeling extra hungry and don't want to do a la carte.  4 stars because the steamed egg was a little watery & quality of meat was decent.",

So you know someone in the kitchen is doing something right. However the waitress is what made my visit not that great. She started off really polite but then kept coming back to my table constantly checking and trying to give us the check 40 min since we were seated. I asked a male waiter what is the limit here and he said 90min so I was confused on As to why my boyfriend and I were being rushed. She then offered to COOK FOR US I hesitated and said we're just going to take a break and she replied \"ready for ice cream?\" Like how does a break translate to check please??? But the MOST UPSETTING PART was when she'd take our plate of meats and just throw it on the grill when we weren't even ready to cook it or even consume it, she ended up cooking our SKIRT STEAK which is pork and \"cooked it\" by cutting it up in small pieces and burning the sides little did we know we'd get FOOD POISONING. The atmosphere of the place is nice, the workers are nice, the food is nice, the Filipino waitress possibly named Jasmine? Less than satisfactory. I recommend this place but just don't let anyone cook for you even if Gordon Ramsay shows up",

The atmosphere makes for a very social place, making it great for parties (have had several birthdays here).   I've been recently and noticed a change in staff, but  the atmosphere still stays friendly. I had gone the other night with some friends and family that weren't familiar with all you can eat style KBBQ and the server, Tyler, was awesome making sure they felt comfortable, made sure the waters and drinks kept coming, and had noticed that he even helped through out the floor with other tables!   As a local and regular I would recommend going to this KBBQ spot, but make sure to get there early for dinner because it gets PACKED.",

Tonight we decided to eat here since I have visitors from California and I always brag about it. We enjoyed dining until we found out that they automatically charged 15% gratuity for 4 people which surprised ME and my friends. I don't mind giving tips to servers because I used to be a server as well, and I know how it is when it comes to tipping but I don't understand the mandatory rule about their tipping.  That decides me to give them a 3 .  Let's not talk about their service just try to visit the place abd you'll know.",

The service is prompt but gruff, though I'd argue that's part of the rustic bobahouse feel. Our cashier was able to give us some great guidance and was especially helpful for pairing boba with our drinks. Everything you've heard is 100% True and then some! Obviously the boba is the main event, and every time I go it's top notch - juicy and perfectly crafted. Don't skip the crepes! The housemade crepes are out-of-this-world good, so save room on your main boba!",

This was actually a welcome change from waiting in crammed spaces for hours. The booths looked clean and the decor modern. The service was very much on point and they were extremely attentive. I guess my main gripe was the quality and lack of flavor in the meats. We sampled practically all of the offerings including the marinated and non marinated options. Everything lacked flavor completely. I actually found their banchan more enjoyable than the meats themselves. I don't think this will become a regular place for our Korean BBQ fix unfortunatley.",

First off, the parking is impossible...it's tiny and no one leaves. So I had my bf drop me off so I could put our names down while he found parking. He circled the lot about 10 times before he gave up and went to find parking in a nearby lot.   The wait was about 30-45 min for 3 people but we did go at a busy time (6:30-7). The indoor area was tiny so we had to wait outside, and it was freezing! We were finally seated at a table closest to the door and we couldn't wait to dig in. At first it was a little awkward cause we were so close to the door and the people waiting were literally staring/watching me eat.   The menu had the most variety I've ever seen for an AYCE, they had specialty items (which do have caps on how many can be ordered), meats, soups & sauces. The $hit is a must try! I enjoyed the bulgolgi nachos which were basic but delicious. & the premium steak was the perfect amount of fat to meat ratio.   I wish I didn't come here cause now I can't get anything close to as good as this was. I will make it a point to eat here every time I'm in town.",

Sammie and Jacob (there was one more but I can't remember her name) were amazing and super attentive. They worked as a team to meet our every need and they definitely went above and beyond the call of duty to provide amazing service. We had a group of over 15 people and they never made us wait too long for anything we asked for....we asked for a lot too!   If you're going to go to ANY KBBQ place in LV, this is the one to go too. The menu prices were much more reasonable, the service is spot on, the ambiance is fun (though if you're looking for a quiet place, it can get a little loud). The meat quality was pretty good for the price you were paying. The only thing I'd say was a little bit troublesome is that if you liked the baby octopus or enoki beef, they come in only limited supply. I wasn't torn up about that because I wanted the other selections a lot more. But being an AYCE place...these kinds of limitations just leave you a bit wanting.",

Yelp never failed to deliver quality value restaurants in terms of high reviews.  Food smells great, like any other Korean bbq establishment with the normal Korean bbq menus.  My wife and I decided to come here today, but service was at a snail's pace, and we waited over 1 hour before being seated, when I see 4 - 5 empty tables.  They could have been understaffed, so it might have been a focus on the quality of service, but the service was still below average.  My expectations are usually very minimal.  In fact, I expect at least average service with average food (for a Korean bbq establishment) and I would give 4 to 5 stars.  My mind may change after another visit, but my current feeling about the establishment is underwhelming.",

Our recent visit today was short due to a unwelcome guest. A live roach was skittering across the wall beside us. The roach made its way to the table near our grill. Our group immediately left the table, after soon losing our appetites. We brought the attention to a nearby staff member who apologized for the inconvenience but could only accommodate us free drinks. We did not finish our meal. The entire situation seemed dismissed and was taken lightly. When speaking to their manager his reply was \"OK\" and did not charge us for \"leftovers\". As a result our group will no longer return this loved place. Very disappointing!...   If you don't mind a potential pest ruining your dinner, this is the place for you. Good luck!",

The servers weren't the most attentive and didn't really seem in the mood to describe menu items and answer questions. We tried the shake shake rice witch I thought was a super clever presentation of kimchi fried rice. But at the end of the day, it was just average kimchi fried rice. I like that the AYCE portions are small. It gives you the opportunity to try a lot of different items and not fill up on just 2 or 3 like other Korean BBQ places in town.  All in all, I'll come back. But only for the fact that it's open late and allows me to eat something tasty and wholesome for a good price.",

Parking is a bit of a pain though and since the restaurant is kind of small you usually have a little bit of a wait for a table. We waited about 25 minutes for our table but conveniently they have some tables for you to sit at while you wait for a table with a grill.   Love that before you even sit down they bring all the side dishes out for you to start munching on. The service was friendly and attentive. The meat selection was vast. The ribeye and baby octopus were my favorite dishes. They were marinated with perfection and were fun to cook.   Everything was pretty good just wish they had more of a selection of desserts as part of the AYCE. The green tea ice cream wasn't my favorite but then again I'm picky with my green tea ice cream.",

I highly trying the Shake Shake Rice that comes in a box for you to shake before eating. The cheese corn is a great option if you're a cheese lover like me. My family is a big fan of the spicy bean soup. Oh and the bulgogi nacho is a must try!  DRINK: The Peach Soju is a very popular drink here.

This place was one of the many I have book marked and we were both excited to try.   We even brought our Air BnB guest with us to try it out for our first time. The drive wasn't bad at all from where we live. The parking in the plaza fills up quick so I suggest going early or later. Not during prime time dinner hours.   When we arrived, it wasn't packed. Not even a wait. We signed in and was seated quickly. Looked like we came at a good time.   The service was great. Very attentive and got our table set up quickly and replaced dishes when asked, and took away dirty dishes when done. We didn't have to wait long for our meats at all.   We ordered the brisket and bulgogi, and steamed egg among the already dished our sides. The Bulgogi was delicious. Brisket was dry in my opinion. The steamed egg was a disappointment though. To me, it tasted very grainy almost like sand. I had my wife and our new friend try to, they tasted some grainy but nothing that would cause a concern. To me it wasn't bearable. I couldn't finish it.   All in all, I definitely recommend. I will be back!",

What you been smoking??? Cuz you should really share! Lol j/k!!! :D  But saying all that, the quality of the beef is not bad... It's actually decent. All the meat that I have tried were good. Tender... Not tough... And flavorful. Try the different marinated ones...like the red wine pork belly... I loved the different dipping sauces but I gotta say that the sesame oil with the salt is always my go-to sauce. Just start getting you meat and get your meat on!!  The side dishes were delicious!! Don't forget to ask for the garlic and the jalapenos...I love to eat them raw but you can grill them for extra flavor. Also get the shake shake rice... Just a tip... If you have leftover side dishes... Add them to the box before shaking and enjoy!! It's kind of like a fun bibimbop...Lol my favorites were the salad and the steamed egg... Steamed egg... So yummy!!!   It always has a long wait... So be prepared to wait... But I normally put my name on the list and go-to kung fu tea to get a tea... So that I have something to do.   And be prepared to leave stinking like the yummy Korean meats that are grilled there... But hey... It's a price that I'll pay anytime...$20 for AYCE... Yup I'll definitely be back!!",

I literally liked every single thing I was served; everything from the salad, the sides and especially the sauce. I even liked their kimchi, and I'm not usually a fan.   The service is also another factor that makes this place so great. They were attentive, friendly, and didn't feel like they were too busy to serve you. Which was especially admirable since it was a bit packed when we went.  Overall, we waited an hour, but I'm not even mad.

Pricing:   - All Day Specials (aka normal dinner) - $22.99 - Late Night Special (10-3am) - $19.99  The main difference between the two is that some of the more expensive meats are not on the late night specials (notably Beef Tongue and Short-rib)  Pros:  -Appetizers are very tasty & offer a change up from the usual BBQ. - Large restaurant, so the wait time is not horrible, but can get long on the weekends at night. - Speedy Service - Large menu  Cons: - Parking is a PAIN. The plaza has 4-5 very good restaurants, so parking here during dinner time can be a nightmare, you've been warned. -Don't always have rice paper (they run out sometimes)  Menu Items I like a lot:  -Beef Belly -Pineapple Marinated Steak -Enoki Wrapped Beef -The SHIT!

We got so many different types of meat but my favorite was the premium steak which is pretty much a whole ribeye, galbi (short ribs) and the skirt steak.

Got here around 330pm, parking lot is small for the area, so I can see this becoming a problem if you want to come here later in the night.   Place was pretty empty. I thought the decor was really nice and we got to sit on the table that was on a platform, which was nice.  I really like the steel round grill as opposed to the rectangular black grill. Meat cooks faster and if it's done I like to push it the edge of the round grill, so they don't get burnt.    The highlights for me were the steamed egg, kimchi, corn cheese, beef tongue, and the marinated squid. I feel like in LA not many places serve beef tongue.  So it was a treat to see it being served here.  The key is to cook it just when it turns slightly brown,  cook it too long and it can be rubbery and tough.    The marinated squid was pretty awesome.  And the corn cheese had really good mayo/onion flavor and not too sweet which I love. Kimchi was yummy and sour. I also like that they provide us with plenty of sesame oil/dipping sauce and bottles of ice water, so we don't have to always ask for more.  I think it's cool that ice cream is included.  Not many bbq places offer that.  I prefer the green tea,  the plum one reminds me of pink bubblegum I used to eat as a kid hehe.   The brisket was too fatty. So we didn't order more of it. We also tried one of the marinated meats, too sweet. I think I just prefer eating plain meat.  The pork belly was ok, also more on the fatty side.    Overall it was a good experience. I would definitely come back again for my Korean bbq fix :)",

Asked us what drinks we want and came back with it quite quickly. The menu simple and easy to read and ordered a few appetizers such as seaweed salad and the sh*t  both dishes was delicious. Highly recommend trying the sh*t.  Ordered a few plates of meat and it cooked on our grill at a fair amount of time. The amount of meat they gave us each time was decent and the wait time for the next plate balanced out our eating time.  They also offer dessert here and we ordered a bowl of ice cream. I appreciate how this place offers appetizers, main course and dessert with a price of one AYCE.   This is probably one of my favorite AYCE Kbbq place because of the price, the marinated meat and the dessert.",

    "text": "If you compare almost any kbbq place to LA's variety... you can give them 3.5-4 stars. For a kbbq spot in Vegas terms.. this is actually really good! Hwaro is a busy location like any other ayce place, but in my opinion it offers the best variety! I've only been here once which was couple days ago, but safe to say I will be back again. It is located on spring mt which is its only downside due to horrible drivers and lack of parking, but once you get beyond that it's not bad. Expect a wait from atleast 10-20 min on a normal day. My girlfriend and I went on a Thursday afternoon and it was only 10 minutes. The servers were pretty busy, so we did not get the most amazing service. That was not a problem because they are only human and have to cater to other customers as well. When the servers were with us I can tell they did their best to accommodate our needs and get us what we wanted in a timely manner. When I go to kbbq I usually get the briskets, pork belly, and for this location the skirt steak. The meats were decent quality and definitely better than tofu hut or doh. They actually have a way bigger variety including side dishes such as \"the shit.\" Try \"the shit\" it is very good. They do a good job on changing your grill. The ayce price was $18.99 (correct me if I'm wrong). I will definitely be back to try their other options!",

Heard about this new place from my cousin and was excited to try it out. My first impression of this place was that it had a more modern and rustic setting compared to any other Korean bbq place I've been too. Plus, the environment was very clean, especially in comparison to Tofu Hut. As for the food, there aren't too many choices but there is definitely a vast amount and variety of appetizers/tapas served with the food - my favorite part about this place. They had not only kimchi and bean sprouts, but also fish cakes, squash, pickled jalapenos and celery, and a ton more. The quality of the food is definitely up there. As for the service, it was overall pretty good. Even though the place got a bit busy and service began slowing down in pace due to this, servers still managed to take care of us and attend to our needs with a smile and positive attitude. Lastly, everything is pretty affordable - the average price you would expect to pay for AYCE Korean BBQ. Overall, great experience. I will most definitely be back.",

My most recent visit on September 27th left much to be desired.  A friend and I ordered Sundubu and were seriously disappointed.  Being Korean, it's hard to get too excited when eating out at a Korean restaurant, but the Sundubu here was awful.  All it had was tofu, water and some chili, which means there was absolutely no taste.  Making matters worse was the fact that the banchan had no taste, including the Kimchi! I'm not sure how you manage to screw up Kimchi, but this place did it.  It was also a disappointment to find out that they did not have their liquor license, so the normal Soju and Hite Beer were also absent, along with any taste that should have accompanied our meal.  I'll stick with Honey Pig, E-Jo or Sura.",

Sat down at the large table cause they're were no smaller ones which was fine. We drank the tea water and it was okay for what's suppose to be like an iced tea it was very watered down so I was a bit disappointed in that and I didn't like the fact that they charged us for it when most places don't. Appetizers were good, loved the salad. When we ordered the first bunch of meat they gave us a platter of everything we order but in kind of small portions and when we reordered something they gave us a lot of that one order. So it didn't make sense to me to give us little of everything then give us a lot later. Everything on the grill looked great, even the pork belly was thicker than what I've usually have seen which didn't really bother me because it was good but all the meats they gave us were chewy. Tasted good but really chewy. They open till late at night so that's a plus but it wouldn't be my first Korean BBQ choice.",

I would definitely recommend this place and will be coming back on my next visit to LV the service and food were amazing!",

I had the pleasure of being taken to flavor town by the wonderful Joey. Not only was Joey's service polite and fantastic, I left in a better mood (Not just because I was hangry).  To sum up the atmosphere of Hwaro; the seating arrangement makes the place feel airy and open, it does not feel crowded even when all the tables are taken.   From the relaxed music to the wood covered accents adorning the entire restaurant, Hwaro feels natural and puts you in a trance while you taste the sweet meaty flavors of the orient.  Hwaro is hands down a must eat. The experience is one that is sure not to disappoint.",

The menu is massive so you will not have a hard time finding food to fill your cravings. I wish I had more room in my belly to try everything! My favorites were the brisket, beef belly, squid and cheese corn. Mmm the cheese corn here is really garlicky and sweet.   Definitely try the yogurt soju! I don't think ours was mixed properly so the first shot tasted like plain soju. But the next rounds were so tasty! Like an adult version of those tiny yogurt drinks we drank as kids.   The service was super slow. There were many empty tables when my group of four got there, but we still had to wait 20 min to be seated. We had to flag our waiter down every time we wanted to order more meat, and we had to ask twice for a refill on our water and salad.   However, for the authenticity and cheap price, I do not mind having bad service. I will still be back for more and you bet this will be my go to place to take all my friends who visit me in town!",

They have plenty. You can order half if you think you want to try a new thing and in case you don't like it. I love their octopus and skirt steak. The rib eye and short rib is ok tho. Can't complain with the price that I pay.   Service just fine. I think it's run in any Korean restaurant. Only at magal and hobak you will get a good service. well i guess it because they have a la carte, not AYCE.  The server not even tell me what kind of meat that they bring it over, if they don't want to explained it to all customer that's fine, but at least ask whether or not we want to know. The meat plate that he brought, he kind of threw it at the side of the table. So rude!!   Come back? Maybe. I just hope that I'm not get serve by that rude waiter again.",

My friend made reservations and once we got there via Uber, we still waited outside of the restaurant for a good 10 minutes. But that was okay. (We weren't in a rush) There were so many people outside. I would say 25 people outside of the restaurant waiting to get in. This was my first time eating here and I didn't mind waiting and catching up with friends.   The waiters and staff are very nice. They came to check up on us, brought us more side dishes when we were done and cleaned our stove pot frequently. However, they didn't refill our waters consistently.   This place is next to King Fu Tea (my favorite boba place) so if you do plan on eating at Hwaro and want to get boba after, save your appetite and room for dessert.",

    "text": "I went there last weekend with my friends. Actually I thought hawro is good but services was bad. I know that they have a time limit but I didn't know that it starts when the customers  sit the chair. I don't want my friends to wait in the restaurant that is not enough space. so I went there early. when I asked I could start time 5 to 10 min later,  they said no. I was wait for 30 to 40min but they couldn't give us 5 to 10 min . Anyway that is find if that is rule . But My point is why they changed word. When I was sitting the table, they said 90 min was only \"all you can eat ordering time\" so you could sit more than 90min.  but 90min later we couldn't order any drinking and we need to order our dessert even though we didn't finish dinner.  Of course I asked we could have our dessert after dinner, they said no and just told us your time was done. I know another people waited a table but we were your guest, too. You need to know that if somebody wait the table that is not our fault. you can make more table. I don't understand why you make the guests are uncomfortable.   I regreted recommending the restaurant.  If you can eat fast or you can be a food fighter , you can go.  but  you couldn't,  it is better don't go.  I was disappointed.",

We demanded to be moved and the next table was a bit more cooler than the first. I was too hungry and wasn't leaving til I ate, Hoping the food would make up for it.

For appetizers you must try \"The Shit\", it's literally called \"The Shit\". I'm not making it up, and like they tell you, you must try. I also get the KFC (Korean Fried Chicken) & the Bulgogi Nachos, best nachos I've had and it's just an appetizer! They have so many options when it comes to meats. I get the Beef Flank, Hwaro Spicy Pork, Sliced Rib Eye, and Spicy Chicken. I've also had Cajun Chicken, but I like a little more kick to my food, so I prefer the Spicy Chicken. The staff is always so nice and multiple staff members will check up on you whether it's there table or not. Tip: I like a lot of refills when I eat food, but with Hwaro, if you want soda, it's in a can. So, I don't drink my soda until my food is cooked that way I don't have to keep refilling it. They give you a pitcher of water, so stick with that until you're food is done unless you want to pay more for another can. Two cans do the trick for me.",

Just about anything we ordered came out within seconds after the server walked away from the table.  The food itself was all very fresh and had great flavors.

If you're thinking about it just go, it's well worth the wait and the crappy parking you'll have to deal with . They have a menu stock full of options for a very good price and it's ayce !! So even better bang for your buck! Their portions are good and their quality is even better. There appetizers too are amazing there is soo much to choose from you'll be overwhelmed with amazing choices. If you're going on any day really these is likely to be a wait. But it's worth it ! So grab a boba from Kung Fu Tea, take a walk or peak around the other stores (they'll text u when they are ready !!!) it'll be worth it !!   Personal Kbbq Checkmarks:    Yes - ayce kbbq  Yes - radish wraps  No - Toppoki   No - Unlimited soda refills (sold by the can)  Yes - Eggrolls   Yes - Gyoza   No - Japchae  Yes - Dessert included !!   Extras:   the Shit ! (It's almost like sushi ! And very good )   Corn Cheese (most places have this but this one is far superior than most. It's so tasty on its own. It reminds me of Mexican corn. It's a must order !!)",

It is so rare for an AYCE restaurant to offer so many items, all the while being fresh and in smart portions. There was a promotion with beers and soju, that made the experience at Hwaro even better! For the price and selection, this restaurant is memorable for sure. A tower of beer, The SHIT, Green tea Smoked Pork Belly, and Hwaro Premium Steak were my favorite portions of the meal. The wait time can extend quite long, but going in the morning near 11:30 secured me a 15 minute wait. The staff was extremely quick and attentive to my table, and made the experience pleasant and fluid. Can't wait to return; staff, keep doing what you're doing!",

My cousin and I went for an early dinner and it was an amazing experience.   Service was so great there and they were very prompt with bringing anything we needed. I find this really important when doing AYCE because you want to maximize your food intake. Lol. We ordered pork belly, sirloin, ribeye, and ribs. Each thing was amazing! The pork belly is a go to for me at these places. The sirloin was a surprise and ended up being super tender and cooked wonderfully. The ribeye is a trusty go to as well and the ribs were seasoned well and also delicious. This place gets Busy fast, so come early. But it's definitely worth it!",

    "text": "Boy were we lucky. An impromptu conversation with our uber driver as we drove through Vegas Chinatown had him pointing out this place as his favorite Korean and a must since it was only a 5 minute walk along Spring Valley from the Chinese Foot Spa to which we were headed. The menu is really simple. $24 for the AYCE lunch, and then a few extra dollars for access to the premium cuts of meet too. Honestly, since there were easily 20 meats that came with the basic lunch, it didn't make sense to spend more money, especially as bulgogi was part of the standard lunch. In addition, you get access to 2 dozen or so appetizers and salads, and Korean Banchans to your hearts content of course. My personal favorite was the squid of all the meats, while BF went for his class bulgogi. If we didn't have a show to rush to we would have probably stayed longer at this place. As it was, we arrived at 2pm and still faced a small wait. Service is friendly and fun. The K-Pop music in background is a better mix than I've heard at other Korean places.  This place is cute beyond words. Korean meets industrial meets zen. There's a fake cherry blossom that is incorporated into the decor. Hard to describe pretty cool.  Obviously we had an uber pick us up, but the lot is space as its part of a shopping plaza.",

    "text": "I really like Hwaro for many reasons, I have some small things I didn't like. This plaza gets pretty busy because the ramen place next door is really popular as well. carpool if you can.   Pros:  You can get all your basic meats for a cheap price during Lunch and Late night ($20) all 7 days of the week. IF you want the more \"premium meats\" like beef tongue and short ribs, you can pay the All day Special price (but everyone must choose the same option).  -They have ice cream options- green tea/vanilla, and you can also get an affogato (vanilla ice cream and coffee) which is a nice pick me up after eating all that food.  -You can order cheese fondu and cheese corn! You cook it in an aluminum cup on the grill and let the cheese melt.  -I mixed meat into my cheese corn and it was awesome. It's actually something they do in Korea too! :)  -Pickled Radish Wraps- my favorite way to have Brisket is with these wraps that are sweet/sour, add a nice crunch, and is a healthy alternative to rice paper -Salad- Dressing is light and tasty. I add it to my pickled radish wrap and I make a little Korean taco that's free of \"carbs\".  -Service was pretty good. Staff came to check on us regularly. It's smaller than I expected -I actually liked all the meat I tried from their basic lunch menu:  Brisket (never fails to disappoint), Prime Rib Bulgogi (the first batch was awesome, the second batch was huge and less fatty so more tough. It was also less flavorful), hwaro spicy pork, and green tea pork belly. I don't like to eat too much pork though. I'm one of those weirdos who cuts off the fat of my pork belly and some of my meat... (don't judge me, my arteries thank me everyday) :)   You have to request sesame oil-salt-pepper for a sauce dip. That's typically used for dipping pork into. Not a lot of people use this, so I understand why it's not standard. They give you a small squeeze bottle of brisket sauce. :)  They have a wide array of korean beers and soju.  I did not try the Hwaro spicy rice or the Hwaro noodles. Those come in large servings and are definitely shareable. The rice is basically like a bibimbap bowl which is AWESOME. I didn't realize until I finished eating that it was pictured on the menu. The spicy noodle also looks fancy. Didn't personally get to try it but I think they also have gochujang in it for the \"spicy\" kick.   Cons:  -Some tables do NOT have a vent. This could be illegal. I personally was sat at one of these tables and ended up coughing a lot afterwards because I have asthma and inhaling smoke usually triggers it. -Their side dishes were not very good. The kimchi was probably the best, but the fish cakes smelled and tasted weird to me. The pickled cucumbers could be a little sweeter in my opinion. I think it was sweet mashed potatoes, but the white mashed thing was a bit too interesting for me to understand. (BUT THIS IS NOT A BIG DEAL. i DON'T NEED SIDE DISHES TO BE HAPPY - except I really like spicy pickled radish.... I wish they had that haha) -Steamed Egg was super bland.",

    "text": "Our family are huge fans of Hwaro...this is probably our favorite ayce kbbq in Vegas.  They offer a good selection of items in their menu.  Now I'm not only talking about the bbq itself but their appetizers and sides.  Personally, I'm a big fan of the already cooked foods (I'm definitely a minority in my family) and they have so much to choose from.  From their shake shake rice, the shit, steamed egg, kfc, etc.  Oh and they have both my radish and rice paper (Hwaro ftw)!  The other ayce kbbqs I've been to, either has one or the other or neither.  You can almost always expect there to be a wait to be seated. Each and every time we've been here, there is always people waiting outside to be seated. So just take that into account when coming here. What's cool though is that they text you approximately when your table should be ready and when its ready.  No need to stay close and wait for the host to call out your name. I thought that was pretty convenient. Especially during those hot summer Vegas days when it's just way too hot to be waiting outside to be called. I would much rather wait in my ac cooled car.  Also it doesn't matter whether it's late at night or during the day, there's a wait. But if you come late night (I believe after 10pm), they offer late night pricing at $19.95. They do offer less than the all day menu but still a win when it comes to kbbq.",

It is definately my go-to place for fair priced AYCE Korean BBQ. Since my first visit here, this place has definitely gotten a lot popular! The waits have been a lot longer especially during the weekends for dinner. They do not take reservations so plan on waiting for sometime! This place is definately great for groups as they have a couple of longer tables where large groups can sit. Otherwise, most of the seating is comfortable enough for 4 tops.   BE FORWARNED. Think about it: it's summer in Vegas and you're essentially grilling indoors. It's about to be hot in this b*tch! So dress comfortably during the summer time. ...or it just might be the AC wasn't working as well the day we came. Also, if you don't plan on going home/hotel after to shower, you're going to smell like BBQ the rest of the day. Imagine smelling like BBQ and being hot and sweaty in Vegas. Not comfortable!  My husband and I love their sides. The kimchi is good here! I love the potato salad. We ALWAYS order beef tongue, brisket, chicken and beef bulgogi, THE SHIT, steamed egg, gyoza, kalbi. I recently tried the fish salad, which is sashimi with spicy (but not spicy) mayo. Of course, it was really good.  The service here is fair. I mean, I don't really care for cheery-outgoing servers when it comes to AYCE as long as you can get the food from the kitchen to our table ASAP. Our most recent visit was kinda slow for some reason.  Will be coming back as always!",

The choices of meats and appetizers were endless which it could easily cost $28 per person back home in the East Coast. All the meats we tried were not too fatty, very fresh and tasteful. Their Hwaro Premium steak was a surprised our party since we received a big slab of ribeye!! I like how the buffet includes dessert but too bad it is only one order per guest. Also, their banchan was yummy especially their kimchi. Though watch out for the seafood salad (mixed/diced raw fish) if you have a soft stomach; it arrived room temperature though raw fish should arrive to our table cold.      Minus 1 star for their service. A few employees in their were not friendly looking. Seems like they are carrying an attitude. I feel like the restaurant is small so they do not really have a main waiter/waitress. One of the waiter was outstanding though. Also, they do not cook the meats on the grill for you-- you have to do it on your own. I am not sure if this is a West Coast thing or they do help you out but our table did not get that treatment. At least, the estimated waiting time I was told for my table was on point! I would definitely come back to this place.",

    "text": "Went to Hwaro one night with some coworkers. I'd never had Korean BBQ before, so it was a total first for me. I got there a bit ahead of my group, put my name in and once everyone got there we were seated. There aren't a ton of tables, so the place was packed.   We ordered a plethora of food and I tried as much of it as I could but it was a lot of food. My favorite was the brisket, bulgogi and the Korean fried chicken. We tried almost all of the meats though, cause who doesn't love a meat filled meal? There was a pretty good selection of appetizers already at the table, which included kimchi, picked onion & radish, fish cake, green salad, etc. You do cook all your own meat there on the table and they switch out the cooking plate regularly. All you can eat for about $25 per person is pretty darn good, if you can eat that much.   The decor was super cute and trendy, with K-pop music videos playing. As I mentioned, it's really small so there's only maybe a dozen tables.   Parking is a nightmare - the plaza is full of restaurants and shops, so at dinner time it's a bit ridiculous.   Overall, I really liked Hwaro and I'm super excited to take my boyfriend there soon!!",

    "text": "Been here a few times now. Just recently visited and it's a pretty decent variety of meats/dishes that you can get with their AYCE package for the price.  When we sat down, our grill/table was already set with banchan and water. We came right before 3PM, so we were able to get their lunch price but after looking at the menu and seeing that the all day special was just a few bucks more and you get access to more \"premium\" meats, we decided to do that instead.  The downside is that everytime we eat here, it's just me and my boyfriend so we don't get to try too many things before we get disgustingly full. I made sure to try the \"the shit\" and their \"shake shake rice,\" highly recommend! That's what I like about Hwaro, they have a LOT of appetizers available on their AYCE menu so you don't have to JUST get korean bbq.   As we were starting to get full, we asked our server if we can do half orders since a full order was wayyYYy too much meat for two people. However there was a mix up with the kitchen and we were sent a full order of beef tongue (which was a HUGE and intimidating amount for two people). Our server was really nice about it and told us that once the food leaves the kitchen to be bussed to the tables, it can't be sent back, but she understood we wanted a half order so she was not going to charge us for any left over meat. SO NICE! We felt really guilty for the food waste though, maybe that's something that they can improve on.   Meat cuts are decent, the quality wasn't anything that changed my life or that make me wanna crave it. But I would definitely come back and dine here because of the great pricing and the wide variety of dishes available.",

Great service, great cuts of meat, amazing sides (get the Shi*), and they even give you ice cream at the end of your meal if you still have any room left in your belly!  We never needed to ask for anything because the servers were so attentive to our needs.  If I'm in Vegas and I don't make a stop here in the future I will be genuinely saddened because of the epicness (not really a word but necessary here) of this place.

The lunch menu is cheaper than the dinner, but they both have the same things on them. Just a good tip to know if you want to save a couple bucks. And the late night menu is cheaper than both! It's always busy late night, no matter what day of the week you go; so expect a wait of at least 45 min to an hour and maybe snack on something beforehand. But once you get seated, it is so WORTH IT.   My favorite go to's are the shake shake rice, red wine pork belly, beef tongue, spicy pineapple beef, octopus, skirt steak, kalbi short ribs and bulgogi. But honestly, you can't go wrong with whatever you get. The affogato for dessert is stupid good.   Great vibe, excellent service and you will always leave satisfied. The only downside is the wait time, but with a place this good it's easy to understand why.",

But be prepared to wait especially on weekend nights. Love coming here after 10pm because they have their late night special which is the same price as their lunch, $19.99.  Service 4/5. Waiters are usually attentive and very nice. Never had a big problem with service here.  Food 4/5. Take advantage and do half orders so you can try everything. I really love brisket, so when I go to Kbbq the first thing I will usually judge on is brisket lol. But like every other Kbbq place, sometimes you will get an AMAZING fatty, marbled plate of brisket or sometimes you will get an OK batch of really thick and chewy brisket (bleh). Hit or miss. Pork belly on the other hand... always a hit. I think they have the best pork belly for an AYCE place. It's sooo thick and juicy I'm even craving it now as I type this. My newest favorite is the beef belly. If I'm not feeling that OK batch of chewy ass brisket, at least I know beef belly will be nice and fatty and never let me down. Oh and only one steamed egg per TABLE. So even if you have 3 people in your table and you all want steamed egg, you have to share that one steamed egg and finish it before you can order another.  Boo.   They are open until 3am and last call is 2am I believe. You won't be disappointed coming here, like I said just be prepared to wait because it is a popular Kbbq spot.",

This place won't be around long anyways- not with other choices available.  All of the recent and more decorative pictures 'under new management'?  Don't expect that sort of decorative frippery.  Maybe you'll get your brisket, maybe it'll just be sliced ribeye.  It's not certain of what it will be, or actually when it will be. Certainly not the fancy plates of meat with garnish and cucumber.    I'm typically pretty indifferent to indifferent service, but here was past the limit- apparently they are following the 'One Restaurant, One Waitress' motto of service.  While the owner(s) stand idly by at the cash register doing next to nothing, the one server is either busy preparing the food (as she vanishes to the depths of the kitchen for upwards of 10 minutes) or running back and forth in a panic.   Walked in- quickly led to the table- In the water glasses, the unwrapped straws looked lightly used.  Odd, ask the server once she came for new ones- she was a bit hesitant, but got new glass, still unwrapped straws.  Does *anyone* actually sell unwrapped food service straws in 2015?    Table fills with the complimentary appetizers- all of which are pretty good.    No cheese/corn as others have mentioned, maybe it's randomly available.   Server lights the grill.  Then lights it again.  Then again.  Asks me for a pair of chopsticks, which she then uses to hold open the gas valve.  Seems to hold- though I would question the wisdom of propping open gas valves with bamboo, but hey.  No chicken tonight, and we seem to be missing two of the items we requested, but that's just setting the pace for the rest of the meal.  The meats seem to be a bit random, though actually good when they are grilled.  After grilling a bit, it's natural the grill gets a bit black and nasty.  Time for a swap right?  NOPE.  Time for the server to wipe it with your napkin.  Swipe, off goes your dirty napkin, and onto the grill.  Your own napkin, not a clean one, my own messy napkin.  Yep, cleans it just as good as you would expect a paper napkin on a sticky flaming hot grill does.  Nothing but paper everywhere. From somewhere she procures a wet wipe and tries again.  Nastylicious.  I have never, never ever seen this before, and never expect to again.    The server gets the idea this wiping business is less than ideal, and actually gets a new grill.    Next time it looks a bit black, same exact thing happens.  Yoink goes my own dirty napkin, and she wants to wipe it off.  How cheap, nasty, gross and weird is this? Would *I* do that to my own cooking, or would I be a clean person like my mother taught me to be?   And if they do this at your table, where you can see it, what about where you can't see, in the kitchen?  Each serving requested is smaller than the last, and takes longer to arrive.  The last order took over ten minutes, when only 4 tables had people.  Not a person in sight, I could have walked out and no one would have noticed.  This is the death bell for any AYCE place.  Once they start doing this small but extremely important activity, it  signals the owners cheapness (as if the unwrapped straws and grill-napking wiping weren't enough)- lack of caring, and impending doom of the establishment.   Raise the price if you need to, but you know what?  It's AYCE.  In VEGAS.  You have 10 places within walking distance who will not do that and are waiting for someone else to blink.  Here's the kicker- the food actually is decent.  In the end, it doesn't matter, there are way better choices to choose from, and I won't be back.",

First off the service - I've only recently started becoming a regular, maybe coming at least once a week and the service is always amazing. I don't know their names, they do their work and I just eat but they are incredibly kind. I usually have different servers but every time I'm there this blonde Korean girl always serves me well. They're very professional here, and as a server, I know this well. As I was reading the other comments, it seemed ridiculous, whether busy or slow they've been nothing but great.   Secondly the food - the food is great for the price you get. I come in for the late night special and it's definitely worth it. This seriously feels like I'm in ktown again. It's better than the gen here, only because the gen in Cali is way better and I'm comparing the two, I don't like the gen in Las Vegas. But seriously the food at hwaro beats it ! The spicy pork bulgolgi will make you fall in love.",

It was 12 a.m and got a small rush and I think there was only one server but she was really nice and patient with us. We were all really starving, a little hangry and it was the 3rd All-you-can-eat Korean BBQ we went to since all the other ones we went to wasn't doing the all you can eat anymore, just Ala carte (dumb, right?!) but later we all agreed that it was the best one we've been to and it was worth it.   Our favorite ones was fat ass, pork ribs, squid and beef tongue. The side dish with jalapenos and radish ( we think they were radish) and the onions were to die for! Fat ass (wine pork) was a great amount of juicy fat and some marinated meat! My mouth is watering again just thinking of all the delicious food we had last night. Definitely will go back again and take the rest of our family there!",

    "text": "I first heard of hwaro from my friend. I told him that I was hungry and wanted some meat, I told him of swish, but he countered me and said I should try hwaro. He said it was cheaper than swish, and more meat selection.   So we got to hwaro on spring mtn and decatur, seating was almost instantaneous. They gave us the condiments and a little later some steamed eggs and soup.  I tried the fat ass, sliced rib eye, brisket, marinated chicken.   Well, since there was four of us, they only seated us on a small table....I thought it was going to be enough. Boy I was wrong. I wish we could be been seated in the big table with 2 hot plates. Well, first time, learn from it. The first time was great. We ordered at least 5 batches. But since there was only one hot plate, the cooking was slow. Can't really make it hotter or the plate will burn the meat. I have told the server to just put a rice cooker with us (I eat a load of rice) since they ate pretty slow on giving me more rice. My friends couldn't believe how much rice I ate that time, they would joke worth me by calling me extra rice.   Anyways, we learned from that experience to always get the big table to have to hot plates to cook with. One for beef, the other one for chicken. Chicken cooked slow since you actually have to cook it through. Don't want to get salmonella.   In a week from the first time I've been there, I've been to hwaro four times, and twice a week thereafter. I'm pretty sure the employees remember me and my friends by now. They know where to seat us.   If you want good korean bbq for cheap, they have the lunch and late night specials for only $17...all day special is at $21. Cheaper than honey pig and swish. But swish is a whole different genre of food, so I would still go to swish. As for honey pig, read my other review.  Would I recommend hwaro to my friends? Yes, actually, I already had. Would I eat at hwaro' s again? Yes, and I already had. What I don't like about hwaro's? They're a little slow on giving us more batches of meat and rice. And also, they always put down the flames so the meat don't cook fast....because they try to slow down the meat consumption. Me and my friends would just put it back up, though. Lol.   If they just let the customers eat as much and as fast as the customers can, they would've gotten a 5 stars. But since they throttle down the food, they get 4 stars from me.  Hope this helps any future customers.",

An expanded menu with better quality meats, MUCH cleaner floors (they used to be oily), better banchan, existent service, and same weak ventilation systems.

    "text": "First off, i usually have pretry low expectations whenever i go to an AYCE korean BBQ place. Especially for $21.95. For that price i expect massive amounts of pork belly and thin sliced brisket. This place goes above and beyond when it comes to selection. They serve a nicely marinated skirt steak, a whole 8oz ribeye steak,( nicely marbled btw), pork cheeks, beef tongue, pork intestine, thin sliced ribeye, as well as many different versions of pork belly. They have both the rice wraps and pickled daikon wraps....very L.A. indeed. The miso soup and egg souffle were both great as well. I definitely felt like i got my moneys worth. Service was also on point.",

    "text": "I ended up here accidentally when we couldn't decide where to eat in Seoul Plaza. My first time here - my husband and I were completely overwhelmed by the size of the meat portions and should have read Philip's review about doing 1/2 orders. 2nd time here - I went with 4 other people and we demolished the food thanks to some seasoned LA KBBQ fans. 3rd time here - there were 3 of us with one grill and things weren't so hectic since we made thoughtful decisions of what to get. I think one of my favorite items they serve here is the salad, which is part of the banchan that greets you at your table when you are seated. It pairs well with the meat or can be eaten alone. I think the key to eating here is getting your grill very hot before putting anything on it and asking for some raw garlic to cook along with your meat (I also just love roasted garlic in general and can eat it on it's own). The pork belly is extra thick (I didn't realize they have a thinner sized portion until reading some yelp reviews), but can be delicious if cooked with patience and you let the fat really render. Some of the other meats I have gotten here and enjoyed were the rib eye, short ribs and pork bulgogi. The pork brisket might also be a crowd pleaser/easy to cook, but I don't think it particularly stands out. I like the dipping sauces they give - one is spicier while the other is sesame oil with salt (which I what I use when making KBBQ at home). I'm okay with the $19.99 price tag since the servers are quick and coming here for my is relatively painless. There are curiously a lot of tables here with no grills and no vents, which I've only seen people use while they wait, so maybe it's for lunch time goers who don't do AYCE? You can also end your meal with a scoop of ice cream. The choices offered to us were red bean, green tea and one other one I couldn't remember the name of. They are open very late and have clear last call signage (unlike Gen Korean BBQ... tsk tsk).",

    "text": "This place is one of the decent Korean BBQ in town in terms of the food, but service is absolutely horrible. I've been here a few times and usually I am forgiving on the service, because I know its either a hit or a miss. But today I had my most worst experience.   I am going to make this a list so here is the experience.  - Waited an hour when I was the 2nd one on the sign in sheet,it seem like they didn't have a specific person managing the sheet and had a few groups get seating before anyone on the sheet.  - While sitting there waiting, there were guest asking about the wait time, but it seems like the workers were unsure and throwing out numbers. If you don't know, don't throw out a number and waste other people's time.  - Ask for coke and water, only to have them forget, Told them the second time and they finally brought it, but did not bring the cup for the water. Do they expect all of us to drink from that one serving bottle??? Ask for cups afterwards and it seems like the cups were not rinse, you could still smell a strong sense of sanitation water.  - Ordered 5 different meat to only have them bring it all in one plate, without giving any explanation on which was which, and only had one piece of short rib  - Server told us that they were out of tongs and said to use chopsticks instead until the tongs were available. She never brought the tongs so we had to ask another server afterwards which seemed clueless and finally brought us one, but... It look like it was not even wash, there a piece of rice stuck on it and was sticky. Told another server and she brought another one without any apology. But it seems like the previous one that they just wipe off. This was disgusting and had me questioning what other dirty hardware that they gave me.  - Had to ask them to change out my grill and before she did, she turn down the fire which she never turn back up. I had to do it myself  - Portion of food were inconsistent, sometimes they gave more and sometimes just a piece.  - When paying for the bill they charged us for 2 cokes when we only ask for one. Thankfully they took it off.  Overall, they need to have a better organization of the front of the house. That night we had like 5 different workers serve us and most of them didn't seem like they know what they were doing. As of now I would probably never come back to this place unless they get their stuff straight.",

It was all you could eat for $19.99 and we didn't even order extra. But because we didn't finish the initial order we got charged an additional $10.99.

The service, the cleanliness, and even the quality of food they served has improved vastly since the change of management. I went on a small haitus from this place from previous bad experiences....but man do I love this place. Always a wait sometimes to be seated, but worth it. Their beef belly, garlic butter, the SHIT, and their brisket are my favorite items to order. I may stick to the same meats every visit but I'm always satisfied after eating here which is why me and my bf always come back. I would definitely recommend any of your hungry tummies craving BBQ to this spot here, you won't be disappointed.",

But the service has never been as good as our first visit.  They have octopus, chicken, rib eye, short rib, brisket, flank, pork skin, tripe, pork belly, pork cheek, beef belly, and bulgogi. The enoki beef is good but there's a 1-order/person limit. Appetizers include gyoza, Korean Fried Chicken aka KFC (yum!), bulgogi nachos, corn cheese, etc. You can also get sundobu in 3 different spice levels with beef, seafood or both. You get salad and banchan.  I like this place better than Tofu Hut because I feel like Hwaro has more selections and the meat quality is better. This is located in the same complex as Monta, Snowflake, Raku, Kabuto, Trattoria Nakamura-ya, etc. so, good luck finding parking space.",

    "text": "Been to every KBBQ place available in the Las Vegas area (Doh, Lee, Honey Pig, Hobak, Magal, Sura, Tofu Hut, etc) and also many in the Los Angeles area (Kang Ho Dong Baekjeong, Thirsty Cow, Hanjip, etc), Hwaro is just the best in my honest opinion.   (Disclaimer - I am not writing this review for the free soda, since I am home writing this.)  Service: The service provided by the servers are very welcoming and friendly. With that being said, they are always packed in the dinner hours but they work efficiently and very fast. Their speed on food deliver and food prep is amazing. This is awesome because slow service for AYCE meals means being full on much less food since waiting for meat never goes well. They had the water and everything prepared for the table before my party even sat down.   Food:  Ordering was easy and there was a wide selection for AYCE. The meat were all fresh and tender. Comparing to every other KBBQ joint in Vegas, they definitely have the best value for the meat since their quality is the same as any higher valued restaurants. The \"shake-shake rice\" is similar or even better than Kang Ho Dong Baekjeong, which is a feat in its own. The squid is the most tender and easily chewed ever, unlike many other KBBQ places with rubbery squids (ew.)  Price: The damage was minimal to the wallet as two people dinner was 56 after tip.   Final Thoughts: Coming back whenever I am craving meat. Mind-blowing experience, delicious food, fast service, great value. It just can not get better than Hwaro.",

The star is how much I like each cut, 2 star are mostly due to no taste or how much fat.  premium steak (rib eye) ** short ribs x 2 **** enoki beef ** brisket ** octopus, *** beef tongue *** beef bulgogi *** pork cheek (ok to skip) ** shirt steak ***** steam eggs ** seafood salad (mix of chopped salmon and red snapper sashimi).  By the way, their shirt steak are pork, a cut close to pork belly but not as fat as the bacon cut. It was my favorite if you can eat pork. Then short ribs.  It's slightly different than what I am expect.  Most of the meat do not have seasonings (only shirt steak, bulgogi, and short ribs have seasonings), find it a little bit too much fat attached to most of the non seasoned cut.    I got there at around 2:20 pm on Thur, so there's no line.  service was good, the server tried their best to explain or give recommendation.  that's why I give 4 stars instead of 3.  Food is 3 stars in my opinion.",

    "text": "Came here with a buddy this afternoon.  We opted for their $17.95 option ($20.95 option includes short ribs and a few more items)  They have a pretty vast menu that includes appetizers such as fried chicken, an item called \"the shit\" which was basically spicy tuna and imitation crab wrapped in seaweed and deep fried, bulgogi nachos (not very good), steamed egg, bean paste soup, and more, which were all included in the ayce deal.   I enjoyed their standard pork belly and the grean-tea flavored pork belly the most, and everything else was pretty ordinary.   Ample number of side dishes. I also liked the dressing on the salad.   The servers were very accommodating to us considering we asked for a lot of things.   Oh and I almost forgot, they also provide one order of ice cream per person for dessert (green tea or affogado). That pretty much propelled this place from 3.5 to 4 stars.",

    "text": "Came here with my parents and girlfriend (parents and I have never been, girlfriend is a veteran of this place, said it's her favorite KBBQ place in Vegas).  I made a reservation the night before which didn't make much of a difference because we had to wait about 5 minutes, no big deal.  I immediately liked the fact that the table already had tools and utensils set up.  We all got AYCE and ordered brisket, beef flank, pork belly, tongue, chicken, squid and spare ribs.  ALL OF IT WAS BOMB!  My personal favorites were the spare ribs and the flank.  I also loved that the meats were fresh, NOT FROZEN.  Tofu Hut has frozen meats when I go there and there's not as much flavor.  I think Hwaro's meats are better than Tofu Hut's.  Where Hwaro may not match up are it's sides.  The sides are standard (kimchi, seaweed, fish cakes, etc.)  I do think Tofu Hut's sides are little better, but the KBBQ is the main reason anyone goes to these restaurants.  We also ordered some of the Sh_t (it's really that good, get it!), some Popcorn chicken (good) and got some ice cream.  I want to give props to the servers because they really stay on top of things.  Changing the grills constantly, refilling our waters, asking if we want anything else and they're pretty friendly.  If you haven't been to Hwaro but you've been to other KBBQ places in Vegas, give this place a try.  My parents, who don't go to these kind of places often, had a great time and enjoyed their meal so that made me and my girlfriend happy.  We'll be back!",

There isn't a place like this in Phoenix but we been to plenty of places like this in LA.  Music is pretty loud in here if you don't mind the rave music then you should be fine. We usually order the steam eggs which we were told only 1 per table, it came out burnt so that was a fail. The server cooked our food for us which was fine with us since none of us wanted to man the grill. We all ordered the all you can eat and yes it is worth it. Their side dishes like the garlic, jalapenos and I think it's mash potatoes with corn in it were really good.   Definitely a place to come for Korean BBQ but the wait is very long so be prepared for at least 1hr.",

First of all, it's open until 3am which is frickin' amazing. The fact that it's $20.95 for AYCE with 52 menu items...that already speaks volumes. The meat here is SO good. The brisket, pork belly, beef belly, premium steak...SO SO good. While most of the meat is frozen, the quality is still pretty decent. You are only allowed one piece of premium steak per person, but it's a pretty huge piece of steak. The only things that were unimpressive were the enoki beef and KFC. Since the enoki beef was part of the \"all day special\" and you only get \"one order per person\" I thought it was going to be super special. It is basically a clump of enoki mushrooms wrapped in a piece of beef brisket. The KFC isn't even bone-in chicken, it's more like popcorn chicken. They were just OK. But I was pleased with literally with all the other meats. The beef belly is SO good. Get it! If you love brisket, you will love the beef belly because it's like a more fatty and juicier brisket. It's also cool that they have the \"shake shake rice\" which is basically like your Korean lunch box AKA doshirak. I thought it was pretty weird that our grill never really burned so it never had to be changed but I'm definitely not complaining about that. It's great that desserts are included in the AYCE. I opted for the affogato which is vanilla ice cream with coffee and it was SOOO good. Basically 90% of the menu is DA BOMB. I must have said \"so good\" in my review at least 5x.",

The host kept telling our group another 20 mins... then another 30 mins... gradually extending the time until finally 2 hours has passed... At this point it's nearly 940-945 that we are seated.  We ask the host of its possible to get the $18 price for 10pm since we've been waiting sooooo long and he says no.. by the way his name is Scott. They also ran out of the skirt steak. Bummed yet again.  I'm in customer service and I make damn sure to make the person happy. So it hits me hard when I rate a restaurant. And he's doing the opposite of this. We do get our food and I'm really happy with it. Is it the best I've had? Probably not but it was really good (maybe because we were starving for 2 hours). Ok I'll talk about some positives - lots of variety of meats (like green tea pork belly), other things besides meats for AYCE (Korean fried chicken, sushi - but the orders are small! We had to order multiple for us). I do wish they had more ban chan. We had to ask several times for refills... When dessert comes around (which is cool because it's included in the AYCE) we are tired and have been there for 4 hours and just want to go home. I ask Scott if there are to go containers that he can put the ice cream in and yet again he says no. Cmon Scott.  So just to warn everyone! Food is great, service is not. I guess that's just how your typical Asian restaurants roll. I should have expected this.",

I asked them to turn it back on and we ordered more. Their time limit is 1 hour and 30 min. The female worker Nametag J gave us meat that were rock hard frozen and the mussel didn't look as appetizing like the previous one I ordered. I ate the meat and it was really chewy. She gave us the bad meat because we didn't leave. I come here all the time and this is the first time they did this to me. It's unexeptable to rush a customer while they're eating",

For all those Kbbq lovers this is a MUST try new place in town.They serve abundt of  banchan  (side dishes) and good quality beef. Sadly they didnt had beef brisket because they ran out of it... Everything was awesome except the salad. According to my friend the salad dressing is more similar to WoonamJung dressing. When going for lunch ask for \"All Day Special\" beacuse you can get a whole lot of beef options than normal AYC Lunch. Its only $19.99",

Got a couple big fat slaps of belly meat and a few chucks of fatty 'meat'. Too much fat, and the pork have the 'piggy' favor that I don't like. I tried to cook them longer: the favor is gone, but I got chewy bacon instead. FYI, I'm not a big fan of bacon to begin with. The worst part is my friend whom dined with me got diarrea. I wonder whether it's because the staff left the side dishes out on the table. Green salad, potato salad and kimchi are set on the tables ahead of time. It's over 100 degree! We went when the dinner crowd was not yet in, so who knows how long the side dishes are sitting on the tables. I rather pay more money to get higher quality of food, then, cheaper price with low quality. Maybe it's just me. I don't think I'll go back again. Sorry Hwaro.",

And, parking is insane so definitely car pool or have someone jump out and reserve a table for your party. Overall great price!",

Salad was tasty but the sides were basically same as similar restaurants and would have been nice to have a little more variety.  I went late night around 1 am and it was still busy but maybe due to the Fourth of July and rest of shopping center restaurants were closed.  I would recommend the brisket, beef tongue, pork belly, short ribs, steak and bulgogi.  Very reasonable pricing but didn't like the AYCE pricing difference with beef tongue and short ribs.  Should probably just keep the higher price as standard since most people get the short ribs anyways, lol.  Service was decent as only one server was on duty to take orders and cook meats as well.  I would go back again and recommend Hwaro for your AYCE Korean bbq cravings!",

Love the Kpop music they play! & the overall look of the place is very nice. Pretty big too.  + comes with a lot of sides! The kimchee was good & spicy, but i've had better. My fave side is the fish cake!  - wait was very long-- almost 45 mins! But the food looked really good, we just stayed.  - the meat has no flavor. You def have to use the dipping sauces & sides for flavor.  - good price & quick service!  Overall, I would come here again just because the overall atmosphere is rly nice, the price is good, & there are a lot of choices!",

The quality of the meat is pretty good, too, and for such a good price.   The only things I don't like about this place: -The water pitchers they leave at the table only fill about a cup and a half...you might have to ask for more pitchers a few times.  -The floor tends to be...slippery and greasy? -Parking can be a challenge, because the location has several other popular restaurants, but if you're lucky, you might get some help finding a spot.",

More selections of meats than nearby BBQ spots, also prices here are much more reasonable compared to other places especially with the options they do give you.   Servers are always helpful and willing to guide you and assist you through the menu.  Service isn't always up to par depending on the time of day you are dining in.  Again, this is Asian dining in friggin Chinatown and not a Michelin restaurant; you guys complaining about service and cleanliness has got to get a grip and take your pretension else where.  Eat the damn food and enjoy.   Getting a table after 5 pm, good luck.  Always a wait for the minimal seating, so choose your time in meeting friends and family wisely. After 10pm is always great and so are lunch hours.",

This place a little different from other Korean BBQ places I've been to because it includes different appetizers on their all you can eat menu which adds even more variety to your meal. We really liked the Korean fried chicken and 'the shit', but can't forget the steamed egg which is one of my personal favorites.   Our server did a great job with checking up on us regularly and making sure our grills were regularly changed out for fresh ones.   Pro tip: wear stretchy pants.",

    "text": "The service was fast, the prices are comparatively low, and the food is aiight.   The interior is comfortable enough, but not really that special. There are booths and regular tables that can seat up to around 6-8 people.      The service was good. Our server kept our drinks refilled and was always available when we needed her.   The food was alright. I noticed that their sauces are different from the sauces I usually get at Korean BBQ places. Personally, I prefer the regular sauces over the sauces at Hwaro, but I know some people love the sauce here, so it's just a matter of taste. Also, a heads-up: The meat servings are one third of the meat servings at other Korean BBQ places. I'm guessing they're trying to avoid leftover meat that way, but it does make customers have to order meat more often when they don't know about the small portion size. Hwaro only seems to have ice cream for dessert, which isn't too bad of a deal since Sweets Raku is in the same plaza for all dessert fans.   Honestly, the best part about Hwaro is probably the price. It ranges from $16 to $20 depending on whether you come in during lunch or dinner (there is also a late-night all-you-can-eat special) and is thus one of the most affordable Korean BBQ places in town.   Overall, Hwaro is a good place to go for affordable late-night Korean BBQ.",

    "text": "So first I'd like to say I go to hwaro very often. Started going there last year and fell in love ever since. I've had a few experiences that were fabulous and sometimes not so fabulous. Overall I love the food though.   The place is busy EVERY night and you can't make a reservation(I've tried numerous times) . You HAVE to try the salad dressing. So good. But they wont reveal what the salad dressing is made of. (I've asked them too.) make sure not to eat before you go because you will want to try everything . If you're a first timer, try a bit of everything but you MUST try : the shit, shake shake rice, spicy pineapple meat, brisket, and their ice creams. You grill your food at your own table ! Unlimited meats (on most ) and eat until you're full.  Biggest thing to look out for: you have to have at least 2 people to do the all you can eat. It's about $22 each . BUT if you have 4 or more they charge a 15% service fee. Opt out of the sodas and drinks because they charge for each one and no free refills(they come in cans). I get the water . It's free plus it doesn't mess with the tastes of the other foods you're trying.   Be careful to watch your waiter or waitress. I've had a few times where they'll just turn off the gas to our stove and assume we are done. If you're still hungry or want more let them know.   Overall good night out for a date or meet up with a friend.",

A+++ Kimchi Tofu soup(not included with all you can eat) B+ Cream Corn something  A+ Egg Soup A+++ Cold pumpkin dessert drink  Recommendation for owner: Pork belly was good and thick but if you add some GARLIC MARINADE... Winner!  Definitely one of our top 3 in Vegas compared to Rowland height, Ca Korean BBQ joints",

They have a solid assortment of different meats and appetizers and their dipping sauce is awesome!  As with most Korean BBQ places they have a lunch menu that is cheaper than dinner but what makes this place great is their late night special. After 10PM you can get their lunch prices for dinner! 100 percent recommend this place to any Korean BBQ lovers!",

Overall, price is really cheap for all the food you can get. The grill takes awhile to char the meat. They don't have shrimp or other seafood options that most yakiniku places have though (except squid and octopus, octopus being really good surprisingly!). I'm assuming the older lady walking around that also finalized the bill is the boss lady? Well she shows no emotion and does not even respond when you tell her thanks so it can get awkward with her.

This one was good but downfall lunch is around 20 bucks and everything I wanted was in different price category. So I ended up with upgrade my menu for 2 items and with tip+tax = 30 dollar or maybe a bit more.  Anyways the food was not bad I was a bit disappointed about the red wine pork belky felt like it was already cooked in advance. ( Only reason I upgrade my menu for red wine porky belly)  However this place is okey sad to be truth only LA know good korean bbq food.  If you guys coming to LA try out Bulgogi Hut worth the wait!  This place gets 3 stars because the service was average the food was average",

To start, their menu looks expansive, but once you start ordering, at least for me, there wasn't much to eat. The meat quality was really poor even in ayce standards. All the different appetizers weren't that good, and truthfully, I just stopped eating because I was afraid I might have gotten a stomach ache. If you're not doing well financially, then this place might be for you, but otherwise, I recommend staying away. Service was bad too, but they were heavily understaffed, so I'm giving them a pass there",

When we used to come through the door and get seated but now in most cases Hwaro has a wait. There's little seats at the front or the tables on the left upon entering to sit and wait. They have a sign-in sheet where you would let the lady at the front know how much there is in your party. All you can eat dinner for two people cost about $46/$48. But you get your monies worth.  They have a lot of great tasting quality meat and sides to order such as gyoza's! It is unlimited for most items on the menu except for some that are indicated with a star. At the end of your dinner yo I have a dessert option before you pay the bill, which is a huge plus. During the summer their AC doesn't appear to work as much so imagine siting in a crowded restaurant filled with hot air, it ain't relaxing. I try to prevent going here in the summer or if I do, I'd go at night. Customer service is good, there's really nice ones who stands out but there are also ones who are just okay.",

We ordered a total of 6 different types of meat (skirt steak, beef belly, brisket, pork belly, sliced rib eye, and pork cheek). Our favorites were beef belly and rib eye as they were flavorful and juicy. I was not a fan of the pork cheek...it was way too fatty and took forever to cook.

After hearing about a new management takeover, I was excited to try it out.  I later found it that it's the same owners of Sushi Neko and Sakana that now own this resturant. While many may know my feelings about those two places, I had high hopes for this place regardless. I was not disappointed because Hwaro delivered on most accounts.  I like the set-up here. It's a small, but very comfortable restaurant. Space is maximized to its fullest potential, which is always a good thing. I also like the prices here, it's not as expensive as Lee's or Sura, it's very similar to the Gen range.  Onto the food. The banchan was solid, I particularly liked the salad. As far as the meat goes, if given the option, I personally just stick to the kalbi, sometimes I'll get bulgogi as well. The kalbi was good, seasoned correctly, a lil' bit on the thinner side, but I liked it. I also how they leave the bones on, I like to chew on the cartilage and fat around the bones, it's my favorite part. But, I'm just crazy like that. On the one order per person part of the menu, I liked the premium steak, I believe it was a NY strip (it could have been a ribeye) and that was really good.  I like Hwaro, it's better than Tofu Hut (which is grrrrooosssss btw), plus, the pricing is competitive, and there is fair value for what I received. I'm down with Hwaro.",

    "text": "Hwaro offers a wide selection of meats and appetizers, but small details and inefficient service prevent this KBBQ place from reaching 5 stars!  Hwaro offers over 52 items for the All Day Special and for only $20.95, this is an amazing deal. The All Day Special includes the Hwaro Premium Steak; the best item on the whole menu. The steak is fresh and if cooked properly, it is the juiciest and most tender piece of meat on the menu. Other items on the All Day Special include Enoki beef, baby octopus, and the spicy pineapple beef steak. All of which are amazing.   Besides these specialty items, Hwaro also offers the KBBQ staples like bulgogi, pork belly, skirt steak, and brisket. To be honest, these staples are great, but they're not amazing. They taste like every other KBBQ place, which is definitely not a bad thing. A few items that I rarely see at KBBQ places are the tripe and the pork skin. These were surprisingly good, especially when they're almost borderline burnt. Both were crispy, fatty, and full of flavor.   As for the appetizers, I would recommend getting the cheese fondue, the corn cheese, the garlic butter, and the shake shake rice. I typically don't see these appetizers on very many KBBQ restaurants, so I decided to try them. The fondue and the corn cheese paired well with anything that was spicy, as it cut the heat with fat, and the garlic butter is a must with the Premium Steak!   As for the service, it was only okay. I've definitely had better, but I've also had worse. My main problem with the service is that they would forget some of our appetizers, even when asked multiple times. I asked for seaweed salad twice during my visit, and I never got it. Service also seemed a little slow (maybe it was because there were only two or three? waiters/waitresses during lunch). I would ask for other appetizers, and they would come 10 to 15 minutes later. The same thing goes for the side dishes, but the wait was not as long. Finally, although the service for the meat itself was quick, we were bombarded with all of the meat at once, even if the orders at our table were not finished yet. To be fair, this is a good thing, but it made it hard to eat/enjoy the food when our party had to constantly shuffle plates to make room for everything. So the experience made it a little overwhelming and cramped.   Speaking of cramped, it was extremely difficult to get in and out of our table. Our table was one of the larger tables in the middle of the restaurant, and I will warn you right now: those benches do not move, and there is very little space to get in and out. It's not really a problem once you've seated, but if you need to use the bathroom a lot like me, it gets pretty difficult to maneuver. And it's a hassle for everyone on that side of the bench. Also, the waiting area to get seating is very small. Expect to stand outside if you are coming during dinner or busy hours.    Overall, Hwaro has one of the most diverse meat and appetizer selections I've seen in terms of KBBQ. I would definitely recommend this place and the Premium Steak. Although the service isn't the best, and although there were other small problems, it doesn't take away from the fact that the food is excellent! I will definitely be back!   ***Side note: If you review them on Yelp, you can get a soft drink or beer for FREE! I recommend writing a short review, then you can just edit the review later***",

Hwaro premium steak meat, short ribs, and spicy pineapple beef steak was flavorful! Great place to eat, socialize, and listen to k-pop and other todays hits lol! Wait staff are on top of it, keeps grill clean. Dined in 3X and will always return. Small joints like this always great! =)",

They have a good variety of meat to choose from and the portions are a good amount when you order the first time. We usually get the beef belly, enoki beef, brisket, beef tongue, short ribs and green tea pork belly. \"The shit\" is pretty good as well. It is nice because they change your grill often. Depending on the day and how crowed it is, the service goes up and down. But usually it is pretty good and the servers are pretty sweet. The location is amazing, but the parking can be really bad. The restaurant size is not that big, so it can get crowed really quick. The dinner rush is usually the longest wait time.",

I can't help but keep going back because I actually like the quality of meat here.  Favorite meats are : brisket, beef belly, pork belly and the ribeye!  Favorite sides : kimchi, salad, and bean sprouts.  Not a fan that you only get one steamed egg! Steamed egg is my favorite, you put it with your steamed rice and make a little fried rice with it. If you want you can even add some kimchi with that to make kimchi fried rice. But again, you only get a tiny one-- which is good to split with, at most, two people.  Very well ventilated so unlike the other places you don't feel all the smoke all up in your face!  They change the grill as soon as it starts turning black or burned.  Utensils (tongs, chopsticks and napkins) are already on the table and the serve-your-self water in bottles are set up along with your sides.   It's a tie between the dislikes and likes but I really like this place as far as AYCE KBBQ place goes!  FYI - New management also made new rule that it has to be a party of 2 or more.",

Parking in this strip shopping center is as bad as most other Chinatown strip malls, and there's really not very much of a waiting room space inside (which totally sucks if it's cold outside). They have about 5 dishes that are gluten free, so I would recommend ordering the cheese as a dipping sauce to my Celiac friends so that you don't miss out on ALL the flavors and textures of Korean BBQ. They really could have added a few more bonchon dishes. They had 6, which included Kimchi, which is decent, but not outstanding.",

    "text": "It's too bad that our service wasn't great tonight, because the food was delicious. We started off with one waitress, and after bringing out first round of meat out, she started to pass our table by. The waitress helping the other side of the room, including the couple sitting next to us on the community table, eventually came over and asked if we needed anything. I noticed that she paid attention to her people way more than she came to help us, and she even spoke at length to that couple next to us.   Maybe I'm mistaken, but what appears to have happened is that our first waitress probably thought the other waitress would take our table (since she was helping the couple next to us). However, there must have been a  lack of communication because we were basically left alone for the entire meal. We had to wait forever to ask someone for water, and my boyfriend didn't even get a chance to ask for rice until after we had finished the meat. Disappointed with the negligence.   As for meat, I recommend: skirt steak (suuuper tender), ribeye, pork belly (prefer the regular to the green tea one) , special steak on the \"all day\" menu (be careful not to overcook it) and beef tongue.   Shake shake rice is almost like if kimchi fried rice and bibimbap had a baby. Not spicy, and pretty good. I wasn't impressed with \"The Shit\" (deep fried nori stuffed with imitation crab and special sauce) though people seem to really like it.   Hopefully I'll have better luck with the service if I ever find myself back here.",

But it gets crowded, and there is a long wait a lot of the time, especially if you have a group. But the most important thing to remember about this place is unlike many other Korean BBQ places, the portions are huge. So if you ask for a variety of meats that you might ordinarily get at other Korean BBQ places be careful, maybe get half of what you would normally do, or order one by one to play it safe.",

    "text": "My favorite AYCE kbbq place hands down!!!  Line is always long but dont worry, it's worth the wait. My favorite here is definitely the brisket and their affogato dessert. If you are feeling adventurous, try the Octopus to scare your white friends. Quality of meat is good and place is clean. The servers are always attentive and quick to change your grill and get you more meat. I also love that they're open until late. My coworkers and I love coming here, and you do get the best bang for your buck cause it's so cheap and you have so much options.   Tip: Order the Garlic Butter and use it to dip your meat. So good!",

    "text": "Hwaro has quickly become my go to AYCE Korean BBQ spot, despite my hatred for the plaza that it's located in. Of the many times I've visited, I've only had to wait once (which was about an hour on a weekend night). It depends on the evening, but I've experienced good service the majority of the time. In addition to the banchan, there's a number of appetizers that they prepare for you in anticipation of the meat. Some of my favorites include the \"shake shake\" rice (rice, fried egg, nori, and spicy pepper paste), steamed egg, and the KFC (Korean fried chicken). I would also say the banchan selection is better than your average. They have some of my favorites such as fish cakes, potato salad, pickled onions, jalapenos, and of course kimchi. They also have cheese fondue, radish and rice paper, and a number of sauces (salt in sesame oil, soy bean paste, and a sweet & spicy sauce).  The meat quality is decent; it's not as great as a place like Hobak, but you're also getting a meat buffet. My favorites are the skirt steak, beef tongue, brisket, and short ribs. They also have enoki beef (one order per person), which I'm a big fan of. Their seafood is pretty limited to baby octopus and squid. Their dessert options include green tea ice cream or affogato.   I love coming with a medium sized group at one of their larger tables and just pigging out. The decor and ambiance is great. The ventilation is a little poor, but that's something of a luxury at Korean BBQ. Dinner is around $21, but cheaper if you hit it up at lunch or late night.",

When we got to the table we got everything like the condiments, sauces, and salad. We ordered beef and pork belly, steak, etc. it was good when we grilled it then we used sauces on the grill like a flavoring for th grill. The service was good but the only thing I did not liked was that when I tried the Green tea smoked pork belly it did not have any taste of green tea. Overall the food was wonderful it was also a good quality and the service was wonderful I would go there again If you are in the area I would suggest this place",

There was a table with a party of 4 and the manager lied and told us that they were 2 different parties but they were all eating off the same grill. So we dealt with it cause we were very hungry. The whole time I was eating I was standing and the manager obviously so that and did not offer to give me a stool or anything. Our server wanted to help but the manager kept rejecting her and us. On top of letting me stand on my table because there was no space. The manager did not offer any discount for the inconvenience and wanted to argue. The food was ok, but the way the manager treated us was so terrible, I really wanted to cuss him out. I will never go to this place again and I will tell all my friends not to go to this place. There are so many other Korean BBQ that has better food and definitely better service who don't let their customers stand!!",

Service might be slow during busy times, but that's with a lot of small restaurants so if you understand that fact, then you're good to go! (Oh and parking during busy times is a BTXH!! But it's not their fault. Lol) You must always finish with the plum ice cream. It just tops off all the meat you ate so well. The yogurt soju was also really good!",

He's always running around the entire restaurant taking care of everybody with a smile on his face. The sauces are delicious and it's nice because they just give you a bottle of it. The meats aren't nearly as fatty as a majority of the competing joints. Their gyoza is so delicious, and their kimchi is fresh. I used to strictly go to Gen, but Hwaro's quality and taste is better! I normally always take advantage of the late night special since I get off work late. It's pretty bad how much I come here now; I think at least once a week.  it's amazing, though! I'll keep coming back!",

So if you're a hardcore kbbq critic my review may not be useful when it comes down to the meaty gritty.  Give me meat bean paste and a great salad and you've got my vote! lol prices are budget friendly too. Please try the Coffee ice cream dessert they have at the end too!",

The salad was very tasteful I love the ginger and vinegar combo. This place offers baby octopus which was well marinated and delicious. Didn't try a variety of meat except for the brisket and tounge.   Also we got a bad table (table 3) the fire kept going out, they came to turn the stove on 3 times in less than 20 minutes. Ugh that was very fustrating so I asked to be moved to another table. Other than that I might be back hopefully to update my review and give them a 5 star.",

Our waiter was very nice and she kept coming in to check up on us and change our grill cover. I enjoyed the meat without the sauces which were supposed to make them spicy. Overall, it was a great experience and I would recommend them if you have at least 45 mins to wait.",

One thing that they should think about is this new idea they just started. The first time they bring you your meat out they bring it on a wooden pizza palette, but its not such a good thing. Food contamination is huge and could get people sick if their food isnt cooked all the way. But other than that its amazing.",

    "text": "I'm not gonna go through and describe every single thing I ate here because ain't nobody have time for that.   My wife and I went on a Saturday night.   Waited to get a seat for about 45 minutes if I had to estimate.   Parking lot is awful and hard to find a spot but there are worse things in life than that, right?  This is the deal, it was $22.95 each for the all you can eat.  This doesn't include drinks or anything else.     I'd suggest getting some appetizers to mix in with all the meats.   Meat is great but sometimes you need a break and need some crunch with a change of pace.    The highlights (all these things were worth ordering and maybe even getting seconds)  Eggs rolls, The Shit, Korean Fried Chicken, skirt steak (regular and spicy both good), short rib, beef bugolgi.     The mediumlights (might order again):  Beef tongue, Green muscles, Enoki beef, brisket.    The lowlights (wouldn't order again)  Pork Belly (was somehow dry and not very flavorful.   Took me a while to be able to get it down)  Beef Flank (on the salty side and not very tender)  Sweet and Spicy Tofu (Was neither sweet or spicy.  They must have left the sweet and spicy back in the kitchen when they brought it out to us.   Most bland thing I've eaten in a while)  I don't remember our waiters name but he was very attentive and friendly.   Very on top of asking us if we needed more food and changing out of cooking grill.    I am stuffed as hell writing this review.   There is a 10% chance I end up with medical issues from overeating tonight.  But I'm all good with that.   Cool place, would go back.  But probably need some time to recover.    P.S- it's $19.95 is you go after 10pm or before 4pm.",

Be here before 5pm otherwise it will be a wait but so worth the wait. They are also great at always replacing the thing you cook on so you aren't using ones with burn marks. Found out owner of this also owns Nabe a new ayce hotpot place, and another sushi restaurant. I guess the owner has the midas touch or just knows how to cater to what customers want, keep up the great work, staff was excellent!",

This by itself is strange but more annoying than the aggressive server was the fact that the one waiter only came to our table three times and avoided us when we tried to make eye contact or gesture to him.   I'm assuming this is a tactic to cheat customers out of the all you can eat experience they are paying for. This is unfortunate as the food was 5 star worthy.   Fortunately there are many alternative Korean barbecue restaurants whose servers don't lay hands on their patrons.",

Dip your skirt steak in that warm garlic butter so good.  This is my husbands favorite place and I have to admit even though I was not a huge Korean BBQ fan this place has changed my mind for sure.  The wait can be long if you go after 5:30 or 6 but it is worth it.  We go for lunch on the weekends for the most part when we do go.  The price is also cheaper and it gives your body time to process all that meat before bed.  Lol",

We had the \"all day special,\" so we could get more variety of the meats.  The banchan were fresh and aplenty. The meats were fresh, and we also got the mushroom wrapped in meat; i think you can only get one per person because it's such high demand. It was delicious!! Then we got dessert; the affogato is sooooo good! I recommend this place. $25/person? Shoot - you cannot beat it - especially for scrumptious food!",

There's kbbq places where the servers cook for you but hwaro lets you do them yourselves! Make sure you flip your meat, don't wait for them lol.   The place is overall really nice and comfortable! And you don't walk out smelling like kbbq because it's not super enclosed like other places! Definitely try this place because it's affordable and delicious! PLUS they're open till 3am so this is your best option near chinatown (most kbbq places there close at 1am or 2am! And you'd have to show up an hour early before that because of Last Call!)",

There was me two other adults and my child. It took forever to order anything and every time we did order they apparently forgot to give us what we requested and we would have to tell them twice before we got anything or flagged down another waitress.  There was two ladies next to us and my boyfriend asked what food item they were cooking and the guy didn't even know. Luckily we guessed and ordered the right one. And our grill was so smokey I had to scrap it myself and had to keep flagging down someone to change it. Horrible horrible service but food was good. I recommend not to come here if u don't care about somewhat good service unless your really hungry. Can't say much about the food besides being good as if I can do it myself at home.",

The restaurant as a whole looks very clean, but the tile floors under the tables located on the far side of the restaurant were unacceptably sticky.  The major problem with this place is that it seems to be 1-2 servers short of what it needs to be.  Each of the servers we encountered had a surprisingly pleasant attitude despite clearly being overworked.  The ribeye and chicken breast were very good.  We appreciate how they changed out our cook plate three different times with each new round of meat brought to the table.  The mashed potato salad, the pickled onions, the pickled daikon radish, and the salad were all very good.  The sign outside the restaurant says \"BBQ and Tofu\".  We did not see tofu anywhere on the menu.  The prices were fair.  The meat was very tender and delicious.",

You can tell how far in line you are - terrible service (our sever forgot to bring us some of our orders) we had to remind him constantly of all of the items that we wanted   The quality of the beef was ok. Some were good others pretty weak. So order the best ones which were the hwaro premium steak and the sliced rib eye. The spicy pineapple beef steak had a great flavor but the beef was very fatty.  Overall, the place is ok. There are so many great places in chinatown that it is hard to justify the long waits.",

The waiting area is very small so if you have a big group you may want to keep this in mind, but I will say this place was worth the wait!  We ordered a variety of things, too many to take photos of, but I remember everything was really good!  What I enjoyed the most about this particular Korean BBQ joint was the variety of meats and the sliced garlic and jalapeno side.  The Must try's: skirt steak, brisket, pork belly, pork cheek, garlic jalapeno beef belly, premium steak and enoki steak.    My group ordered the steam egg which I would've never ordered on my own, but it was really good and a good complement to the meats and rice.  Make sure you stock up on your sauces, the sesame oil and salt and the soybean paste were my faves.      And don't forget dessert, they serve affogato!",

The ambiance is nice, Kpop music pretty loud, small restaurant so I would not recommend for large group.  All-you-can-eat Korean barbecue lunch is $19.95 per person. You can order as many meats, side dishes, and appetizers as your heart desires! but I did see there is a side note that leftover you will be charged $9.50.  We ordered  -Green tea smoked pork belly -Sliced rib eye -pork cheek -spicy pork bulgogi -KFC -seaweed salad -squid -the shit  The meats were on point.

They explained how to order, so we did, and customer service was top notch. I think we ordered most of the sides and everything came to our table in minutes. Servers were always checking on us asking if we need to order some more food.  My favorite side is probably the hwaro rice which is like a bibimbap, korean fried chicken, bean paste tofu soup, gyoza (i can go on and on you know.

If you come here for dinner or on the weekends expect to wait at least an hour if not more. I have been here several times but this last time I came in for lunch and it wasn't too busy but they still told you when your 90 minutes was up. There's a decent variety on their menu and most of the meat was tasty. I was not too impressed with the service this time around though. Service was a bit slow and when I told the server she gave me melted ice cream she argued with me. I hope to come back in the future to give it better review!",

It was actually at Hwaro where I tried KBBQ for the first time, and I've been a fan of KBBQ ever since then.   Food: 5/5. Food here has always been fresh and tasty. The meats are seasoned well, and are cut to a good eating size. Some of my favorites being the beef brisket and pork bulgogi. The sides all compliment the meats well. My all time favorite being the potato side dish, salad, steamed egg and cucumber kimchi.   Service: 5/5 I love this restaurant and I can tell I'm not the only one. There has always been a wait every time I've dined here, but the plus is that they have a waiting system that will send you a text once your table is ready. The service has always been top notched, the food is served promptly and the servers are kind.",

The only downside of this place is the wait time, but that's every kbbq restaurant in town that has a wait time problem. Their meats are fresh and their sides are pretty good too. They bring the meat on a big cutting board. Service is great, they bring you everything that you ask for. They also consistently change the grill for you. Their green tea pork belly has lots of flavor and I would always recommend getting the cheese corn and garlic butter.",

They have an all day special for $23.95 that gives you access to more meats on top of the lunch selection, but we chose to settle for just the lunch special and we have no regrets!  The selection of meats was more than enough, we really enjoyed the garlic beef belly! One of the best things about this place is the array of appetizers that are included as well! From takoyaki to shrimp tempura.   We ended our meal with vanilla ice cream and full stomachs. Good food and good service!",

    "text": "Visiting here from Florida, and I must say this place is the best bang for your buck! Their lunch special is from 11AM-4PM for $19.95 a person. You get around 45+ items AYCE from the menu, ranging from bulgogi, brisket, pork belly, to their delicious sides: seaweed salad, gyoza, Korean fried chicken, steamed egg, and shake shake (bibimbap). On top of that, dessert (scoop of ice cream) is included! The meat quality isn't as great as other KBBQ places I've had, but the menu overall makes up for that.   The only downsides are that the restaurant is a little small. We came on a Sunday night around 8PM and the wait was 90 minutes long, so expect to have long waits. I would call ahead of time to check how long the wait is. Instead, we came the next day around 11:30AM and we didn't have to wait at all.   Despite all that, the food and service makes up for it all. Our waiters/waitresses were great and were quick to tend to our needs. It's a shame we don't have a place like this in Orlando. I will definitely be coming back again when I visit Las Vegas again!",

    "text": "*Picture attached is from the last time we ate there and received amazing service from one gentleman.  I hate that I have to write this review because this is my GF's favorite KBBQ restaurant, but yesterday was very disappointing. Usually when we go there to eat, the service is always top notch and we've never had any issues.  Upon arriving, the wait time was normal and we didn't have to wait too long to get a table. We ended up getting seated at a 4-top and our \"first\" server greeted us and took our order right away because we already knew what we wanted. So a few minutes have passed or so and another couple gets seated next to us. They also order all their meats, appetizers, drinks, blah blah blah. We're all waiting, and we notice that the couple got everything they ordered within like 3 minutes while we sat and waited. 10 minutes pass by and we're still waiting for what we ordered while everyone else around us is getting things very quickly. Another 2 minutes pass when our server finally realizes that we didn't receive anything besides a cheese fondue.  We finally get some of the things we ordered and just started eating because we were starving. Into our meal, no one really checks on us until like 10-15 minutes later when the food runner notices our grill looking burnt (he was probably the only attentive one). Our server finally asks how we're doing and we order another salad and a few meats again. This time, the wait wasn't too long except that the salad never came. Out comes our \"second\" server and she kinda seemed much more attentive than the last one (we never see the first one again). We try to order our salad again, and things start to look a little better. Now while we're still literally cooking the meat, she comes around and asks if we wanted ice cream and we noticed she turned off the grill. We say no and order another round of meat because we're obviously not done ordering. A few minutes pass by, and she brings the check which we never asked for (we were still cooking and eating). My GF and I look at each other super confused because that's never happened before. I told my GF to order more meat but she was already embarrassed because we were handed the check...we also never received our order of meats.  We honestly felt so rushed that we didn't even get to enjoy our food or really anything. The server came back one last time asking if we wanted ice cream, we said no again and she kept looking at the check. I just wanted to leave because I super disappointed. So I've never paid at the table, I always paid up at the front. We get up and start walking up there, & tell me why our server starts pointing us out to her co-worker like we were gonna run out or something. That was strike #3 for me. She even all of a sudden appeared by the cash register I guess to see if we were really paying. I don't know...but I will not be coming back for a long time. Yesterday was just really bad.",

Everything we wanted was on the partial menu, so we did that plus got the discount! Even if you aren't military, come eat here!! The food is SO good!!

    "text": "Unpopular opinion: this place sucked. My friend had eaten here before and really liked it so I trusted him and Yelp based on the ratings. We knew it was going to be a long wait at 8pm and ended up waiting an hour and 25 minutes for a table. Again, it was expected.   We were sat in the back corner when a few other tables were open which kinda sucked but our server was very nice and friendly. Mind you in Asia they usually sit the Gaijin in the back which I have experienced many times and being brown with my friend whos quite a bit darker we joked about it. Appetizers were on the table when we arrived but the kimchee was terrible. It was by far the WORST kimchee I have ever had. It was dry and looked old. Mind you, Ive eaten a lot of KBBQ stateside and in Korea. and this was definitely low place on the totem pole.   They then brought the appetizers, the shit (fried crab with may drizzle, gross), egg rolls (basic/average), Gyoza (basic/average), korean fried chicken which was topped with a HEAVILY mayo based honey mustard. It absolutely ruined the chicken. I was excited to try the bulgogi nachos and it was terrible. Tons of mayo sauce, no cheese, and barely any meat.   I was disgusted at this point but was excited for the meats! The meats would be the saving grace since everyone talks about how good their meat is.. Effin A cotton, effin A.   Round 1 Brisket- how can you mess up brisket, it had SO much fat it was mostly just white fat after it cooked, barely any actual meat! Beef Bulgogi- cheap meat that was ok Short Ribs- probably the best thing they had and the server recommended it  Round 2 red wine pork belly that fell apart after cooking and tasted like carnitas (best thing in the round). Spicy flank steak- heavy sauce and decent tast regular flank steak- lots of fat, hard to chew  We didnt do a round three because even my friend was disappointed.   The saving Grace: Vanilla ice cream with affogato. By far my favorite thing they had.   If it was not for the good service and delicious dessert they would get only one star. When I think about the wait time vs experience, I do want to take it back to a 1 star though.",

The guy would leave after we ordered and didn't return. We had to get up multiple times to find someone to bring us what we ask for. We were there for 2 hours and left hungry. We will not be returning.",

    "text": "When the wait at Hobak are too long what other alternatives are there? Tons of AYCE Korean bbq joints that are sub-par and fail to deliver there is one that I go to. Don't save it tomorrow, go ahead and try Hwaro!!  Setting: In the very busy sweet raku/kung fu tea plaza, expect to come to the restaurant and being seated right away or waiting (obviously weekends are expected). The inside is nicely spaced out with decent ventilation. They have a rule that you can't eat if you come alone? haha so find some friends  Food: The grill itself is pretty poor and won't give you an even char for beef meats but is adequate for brisket, sam byup sal, and spicy pork belly as long as you cook on the perimeter so the juices can drain giving the meat a good cook. They just added what they call \"shake shake rice\" which is the gold tin can that contains white rice, egg, red pepper paste, and nori so shake that bad boy up and enjoy!    Dessert: They offer affogato (vanilla ice cream with a cream coffee pour) which is quite nice and unique for a kbbq place.   Service: They now grill your meat which is definitely a hobak influence but be mindful because the servers tend to multiple tables and may flip the meat when it's not ready. One thing I didn't like was after we paid, the lady came and started cleaning the entire table off to basically tell us to get out for the next customer? Subtle? not really but we got the hint.   Overall: Amongst the AYCE kbbq i like coming here if hobak has a 45 minute wait.",

    "text": "Only having 15 generally average Yelp reviews over two years in the middle of one of the most foodcentric plazas in town did not help the previous management in what was formerly known as \"Korean Delicious\".  So it comes as no surprise that new people have come in, made a significant facelift in decor, and dole out some decent AYCE KBBQ at a nice bargain price of $20.  This is still very run of the mill.  You go in, expect to be brought multiple plates of banchan, and assume staple items like kalbi, pork belly and bulgogi are good.  Check, check.  There's certainly nothing wrong with that.  Beef tongue missing from the menu was a little disappointing, flank steak was dry (blame the cook?), but there is plenty else to load up on.  If I could do it over, I would have gone with half orders of the meat so we could have tried other offerings like small octopus, baby back ribs, Hwaro pork belly (thin sliced) and even pork skin.  Airing old school Mazinger Z shows on the television made for a nice bonus.    They will most likely have to depend on the overflow of neighboring restaurants to survive in a square full of Vegas stalwarts (Raku, Monta, Kabuto etc).  That might prove to be enough since the parking lot is packed to the gills on many evenings.",

    "text": "Wow.  Another great addition to the complex I frequent the most when I'm in the Chinatown area.  Surrounded by Monta, Raku, Zen Japanese Curry, Big Wong, the Shaved Ice place and more, all that could be asked for is an AYCE korean bbq joint. Sweet!  Parking:  The complex location is home to so many popular restaurants so while there is ample parking space, many times it will be near full.  People are coming and going all the time though so it's a just a few moments more between you and some really good food.  Food:  We tried almost all the meat selections they had and there were plenty to choose from.  Hwaro pork belly, brisket, sliced ribeye, sweet & spicy pork, boneless marinated chicken, short ribs, pork shoulder butt, pork ribs, and beef sirloin of flank with soy sauce to name most.  All those named above were very tasty.  Nothing tasted bland or dry.   Everyone in my group has their favorite but we could all agree that (surprisingly) the boneless marinated chicken was one of their best.    I didn't get to try the pork skin but the group I met up with stated they did not like it.   From what I saw of the remnants of it, they probably didn't cook it long enough to the point where it would probably be very very crispy and a more enjoyable experience to eat.   They also didn't like the tripe.  Those are more of an acquired taste I guess.  The complimentary side dishes were plentiful, tons of variety, but many I probably wouldn't care for.  Still, it is nice that they offer more options for those that enjoy each dish.  Off the top of my head, rice, bean sprouts, sliced onions, daikon radish, bean curd, some type of anchovy looking thing, kimchee, steamed egg, salad, potato salad,  jalapeno slices, garlic cloves, dried seaweed, as well as sesame oil, and some hot dipping sauces.    I came late and when I asked for a side of the cheesy creamed corn side, I was told they ran out.  Okay, when you have your grand opening in two weeks, please don't run out of food.  Or it is possible, like a reviewer below me stated that the dishes might change daily?   The steamed egg they brought me was a little overcooked on the bottom, you could taste the burntness of it.    As far as the restaurant itself, very clean.  The service was fine except for having to ask for the cheese corn side dish three separate times before they finally told us they ran out.  The only other thing I'd bring up was the table set up in the middle.  There are two tables side-by-side in the middle which can easily host a group of 8 people.  HOWEVER, only one of the connected tables has a grill.  Cooking for 8 people on one grill would be an inconvenience that I would not want to experience.  It would be better to just split your larger group into two smaller ones.  One of the managers, Jae, stated they will have their grand opening in two weeks from now.   He states they plan to change their hours to stay open until 3 A.M.    This is perfect for the late night grubbers and partiers out there.    If you like AYCE Korean BBQ for a very reasonable price of $20 for dinner and you have an appetite, definitely come here.  There was no wait for a table like you would expect at Tofu Hut down the street and the meat was in my opinion better than the latter.  Can't wait to come back again soon!",

I went yesterday for lunch because I was craving k-bbq and was curious to see if Hwaro is still good. Sadly, the quality has gone downhill here. I did the all day special for $23, which basically included every meats offered on the menu. The only good meats were the pork cheek, squid, and baby octopus. Brisket was too fatty. Tongue was too chewy. The prime steak, which is supposed to be the best and hence, is limited to one per person, was tough as heck. The skirt steak was better than the prime steak. Steamed egg was good, but bean paste soup was flavorless. Green tea ice cream tasted like vanilla ice cream. Service was ok; better than average Asian restaurants. Overall, I left feeling very unsatisfied.",

Don't get me wrong, I love Korean food, but I just feel like if I wanted to cook my own food, I'd stay at home and cook. But I digress, lol...  The pros - service was great. We made a reservation and the table was set up with ban chan as soon as we arrived. The food came quickly and servers stopped at our table frequently to see how our food was, if we needed anything, etc. I enjoy the ban chan almost as much as the main course and the ban chan here was really good. I also liked that the meal came with steamed egg and tofu soup.  The cons - I was expecting the meats to be more flavorful. The kim chee tasted like it was made a month ago (full of spice and flavor) but the meats (chicken, kalbi) tasted like it wasn't marinated long enough or with enough marinade. The sweet and spicy pork also tasted like it was missing something. Here more than anywhere, the meat is supposed to be the highlight of the meal, but for us, it wasn't.  All in all, the experience was good, but the food fell slightly short.",

And after 50 minutes wait the host escorts us to booth small as 4 people can seat. I asked him can we go to bigger tables ( was that time big and large table empty. No one seat there) he told me big table for large groups. So we ask couples of chair to fit on. Was very small space and difficult to cook and eat. Also they put the meat on the looks like cutting board  the blood from meat spills on table and waiter put dish to top of board. Very disappointed and contaminating this is healthy issues. I can't believe it . We asked sanitation tissues to clean the table but waiter bring towels to clean top of table OMG!!! During the eat  we see the big large table have 3 people seat eat. Wow large groups huh????? So since when 3 bigger than 6? Service terrible so hard to find waiter or waitress and still pay tip automatically? Please  I never go there again I make sure who ever read this know how terrible this place.",

My friend recommended we eat at this place because of the low price, which was a plus; however I guess we went at a busy hour cause we had to wait for almost 2 hours to get seated. What really pissed me off was that we were standing around near the exit and noticed other people were sitting at tables that didn't have the grill. 1 hour in we asked if we could sit there and that's when they tell us that those are the \"waiting tables.\" would've loved to know that an hour earlier. When we finally were seated it took forever to take out order and it was so hard to get a waiter cause they would always walk past us really fast. It my friend ordered a dish 3 times and they finally got her order to her when we were leaving. The food wasn't that's great and the service was mediocre but I won't grade too harshly on the service because it was crowded. If your looking for a cheap KBBQ place this is it but that's about it.   All my friends and I can agree that were not going back to that place.",

    "text": "I was very excited upon hearing about this new korean BBQ place, because it had hang jung sal (pork butt shoulder? Im not sure lol) and they give you steamed egg as many times as you want. Other places give you steamed egg once and that's it! The bean paste soup was decent as well, too salty in my opinion. So this place closes at THREE am and the boyfriend and I had gone around 7 pm after work to get a bite to eat. The hang jung sal I was so excited to get was on the special list where every person can only get one order? I was already disappointed at that then they tell me they ran out already?!?! It wasn't even busy and how could they be out of the special at 7 pm if they close at 3am, way to plan ahead -_- So after all this, I decided to just eat the other things on the list since I had no choice. I noticed they had green tea pork belly and they also had another flavor but I forgot what it was called...it was wine flavored!! When we got these, I laughed because it literally looked like they sprinkled some flavor on it just to show they put something on it. When it was all cooked, it didnt taste like anything, it just tasted like the normal pork belly without flavor. Also, midway through our meal, we noticed that everyone had the lettuce you eat with the BBQ. We didn't know about it because our server never told us about it and didn't even bother to let us know later. When we asked, he just said \"oh, I forgot\". Since were on the topic of the server, I had to ask him THRICE for things. I asked for garlic and sliced onions so I could grill them to eat it with the meat. He forgot so many times that when we actually got it, we didnt even cook it since we were so full. He also did this with the soda. Thank goodness they have water on the table you can pour by yourself or we would have been so thirsty. I didn't get it because it was not busy at all. The side dishes are okay and I just did not enjoy anything about this place. Gave it two stars instead of one because the decor was cute.",

One thing I would change is that on their menu, they have an all day special that states \"one per person\", I would change it to, \"one order per table\" as they give you a whole table's worth of the order. But other than that, great and fast service, and excellent food! Will be coming back in the future!",

The place is super chill, with a hipster vibe.  They had k pop videos playing on a tv while having k pop over the speakers.  We went in pretty late, but it was still packed.  The quality of meat is great.  The brisket was our favorite, with the banchans.  I really enjoyed the dipping sauces that they gave to us.  Staff was super solid.  They seemed a bit overwhelmed, but they were kind to us the whole night.  They did have a mistake on my check, but they fixed it right away.  On the second go, we went in for lunch, and we were the only table there for the most part.  My sister and I were super hungry, so we basically ordered everything on the menu.  I really enjoyed the beef belly and short ribs.  the belly was super fatty and buttery, while the short ribs were very tender, and the flavor was on point.  The baby octopus was also quite nice with a little snap.  The only reason why i didnt give it five stars was because the service the second time was a bit sub par.  Dont get me wrong. when we came in the second time.  Our server was super awesome. But while we were there, there must have been a server change.  We sat for nearly a extra half hour for the check.  We moved our plates and bowls to the end of the table and cleaned up for them to make it easier.  But the new server just stared at us from across the way.  When we flagged him down, he brought us water then walked away.  Other then that, this place is awesome.  It has become my favorite all you can eat kbbq.  The meat is amazing.  Service most of the time is on point, and the price is just right.",

It's 20 dollars for all can you eat, with 16 dollars for the lunch and late dinner special. You are given a good number of sides \"kimchi, dikon, etc.\" and a bowl of rice, if you run out, you can ask for more. You pick what meats you want, and you cook it. In the table there is a grill for you to cook on. If the grill get to dirty/burned they will change it out with a new one. This place is great for long dinner, so don't of if you are in a hurry.",

We had to ask twice what they were before someone would tell us. The biggest No-No for us here is drinks are not unlimited. Thats a deal breaker that will force us to never come back. $1.50 gets you a can of soda, if you want more, pay again. No fountain drinks. They said this place has only been open for two weeks and it really seems you get what you pay for. Service is very lack luster, and the menu (already small) has shrunk since the place opened. Two options have been removed and they cut deserts and soup all together for AYCE. Thats right, with AYCE you get meat, and that's about it. Thats a problem seeing as how there are less than ten options. Having never been to a KBB place before my friend and I were very inexperienced and had no idea what to order or how to cook it. From what we had seen, most KBB places are very nice and will cook your meat for you if you have no idea what you are doing; but not Hwaro. Our pretty waitresses were that, and not much else. They seem very fake in character, and don't seem very experienced at all. On our first order she offered to cook our meat for us and loaded up the grill. Problem is she never came back to tell us when anything was done. So we would have ended us with black meat had we not taken it off really well done. After that first round they never did help us again with cooking preparations or times for each mean, it was YOLO or NOGO. This place messed up pretty bad in our books for many different things. I feel like I got my $19.99 in meat, but if that's all I wanted i'd just go buy a steak and eat it raw. Look someplace else i'd reccommend. This place needs much time to mature.",

In the complex of the restaurant, there was famous Ramen restaurant, Monta, boba tea cafe, Kung-fu Cafe and etc. There were so many cars in the parking lot since there were many good restaurants. When I walked into the restaurant, I could feel that the place was really popular. Every tables had grills and already filled with customers. There was no bar or other rooms to be private. It had several tables with blinds. I ordered beef tongue and pork belly for my order. I grilled myself for the meats. I love to have rare medium for my beef meat. Especially, beef tongue was really thin, so I had to grill them quickly. Beef tongue was chewy and lighter than other beef part. It smelt a little bit, but it didn't really distract me. Next, I had pork belly. Pork is the meat that you have to cook it well-done. So I cooked well. It felt like thick bacon. It had its own smell from the pork meat, but still taste good. It tasted greasy and oily. It was such a great meat to have with drinks. Even though it takes some time to cook for yourself, but as new experience, Korean Barbeque is good one to have.",

    "text": "Hwaro is an AYCE Korean Bbq restaurant in the same shopping mall as Big Wong and Zen Curry. It's also my new favorite! I like the booth set ups it offers a bit of privacy. The quality of meats have been really good so far ( have not tried everything n menu yet) my favs so far are the chedolbaegi ,bulgogi. Their steamed egg is pretty perfect also. The owner always greets me very warmly and the wait staff has been so sweet and attentive. My one tiny gripe would be they offer no kinds of dessert. Koreans aren't big on desserts but they do love fruits and dessert beverages. I think adding some simple desserts of fruit and sorbets or mochi and drinks like cinnamon punch and sweet rice would be a really good addition. They offer lunch prices and late night for 16.99 and dinner for 19.99. IMHO they are way better and soooo much cleaner than Tofu Hut and less expensive than Sura. Give this place a try!!",

    "text": "I don't know if we came at a wrong time or something, but this was literally the worst restaurant I've ever been to since I've lived in Vegas. And I go out a decent amount. It first started when we walked in and signed our name to wait for a table. We were told it'll be about 20 minutes. No big deal. After about 15 minutes, my wife and I noticed two other couples that had came in and signed up after us had already been seated. Didn't say anything. Finally they take us to our seat. About 20 minutes, like they said. No complaint on that aspect. We get to our seat and we aren't greeted again for another 20 minutes. During this 20 minutes, we noticed one single waitress going around to every single table in the restaurant and taking orders, filling up drinks, bringing food, etc. One waitress for like 15 tables. When she finally got to us, we ordered 5 different meats because we figured we wouldn't hear from her again for a while. We were right. The meat was very good. The sides are also good. And I'm glad they gave us two carafes for water. So we could give ourselves refills. On 3 separate occasions we asked for orders of different things. Didn't get a single one after about 15 minutes, so we just decided to give up. The worst part is that we saw the busboy bring 2 of those items go to another table in the restaurant. One that just got there. It was blatantly obvious that they hadn't ordered it based on their facial expressions.  But hey, free food. They ate it anyway. After we gave up and went to pay, the same single waitress was also the one working the register. She was working her ass off doing every job in that restaurant almost. And no surprise to me, there was no manager there tonight. I'm not happy to claim this restaurant as my least favorite in Vegas because of all the amazing reviews this place has. But honestly, I found that Tofu Hut (just down the street) is 1000x better that this place. Same concept, but the service is absolutely amazing comparatively. And the food is even better at Tofu Hut.",

Definitely upgrade to the all day menu just to get your hands on it. It was affordable at $19.99 for adults and half price for kids from 3-8. My daughter doesn't really eat much so we bought her a dish a la carte which they were cool with. My only complaint was that the service was a bit slow. We ended up getting the meats before our side dishes which is a first for any Korean place and they don't have hot tea! What?!? This will be our go to in Vegas moving forward. Much better than Honey Pig!",

Usually get the same worker for some random reason but he will bring us everything right away making sure our grill is clean, if we need more rice, brings water bottles before ours are finished. Customer service is absolutely amazing which is one of the reasons we come back.   Hours are amazing, they are open late which is convenient as work ends at midnight some days. Regardless if it's for lunch or dinner I can come in and enjoy my time with out the need to rush. Plus since the food is amazing I always leave with a full stomach.   Definitely a place to visit either when passing through Vegas or a residence.",

Now her being the waiter and seeing it happen I felt I didn't have to say anything and get something like a discount. Now I don't normally ask for things like this but my pants were wet as if I sat in a pool of water. So I finish, get up to pay. The cashier finds out our table and the waiter even comes up to confirm that it was our table. And nothing was done not even a apology. I guess they give a shit what happens as long as people pay.

The brisket, short ribs, and beef tongue are my favorites. They also have a variety of sides and appetizers to try while you wait for the meat to cook. After your meal, they offer ice cream (either green tea or coffee) to each member of the party.   My only complaint would be the wait and how the staff handles the rush. There is almost always a long line of parties (when I come) and it's a surprise that the staff hasn't figured out a more efficient way to handle many customers by now. When I was here with a few friends, we had to consistently check the waitlist to see how many people were before us. We did this because we noticed how the host sometimes crossed off parties before they are seated; it causes a mess because there are more complaints and the line is held up for an even longer period of time. I also noticed how the host didn't go outside to check for the next party on the list and that seemed to cause an issue as well, because those who are outside never know if it's their turn. I understand that some places don't usually consistently check outside, but sometimes it's so crowded that customers have no choice but to wait outside.  Conclusion: if you don't mind waiting a long while, then it's a 10/10 recommend.",

    "text": "TL:DR - Good food, fast service, but weird restaurant.  Dinner is around $25 after tips, no reservations taken.  I would come here if you have 2-3 hours for a meal as the wait itself is always over a hour long after their restaurant has filled up. The restaurant itself has a weird layout as a third of their tables have no grills on them, making them useless in a KBBQ establishment. Also, the past couple of times I ate there, I was seated nearest to the kitchen/ and the pathway to the restroom. The stench of commercialized sanitizer was very overbearing to a point where it was slightly unappetizing. If you can, please try to sit as far away from that as possible.   Service is brisk like most KBBQs. Food items come out quickly.   Onto the food, this place is a very solid AYCE KBBQ, their selections are fresh and they try with different marinades for some meats such as pork bellies and chicken. Their beef belly is a fresh slab of beef 'bacon' and is highly flavorful. The BABY OCTOPUS is definitely a highlight if you like that sort of thing. They also have your typical frozen thin sliced meats such as beef brisket and tongue. The appetizers are AYCE as well, and they have a couple good selections on there such as \"KFC\" and \"the shit\", mostly fried food. The banchan includes your typical selections one would find at KBBQs, nothing extravagant. Steam egg was slightly burnt every time i go, which is unfortunate (yes you can burn steamed egg).  Overall I would return, however just be prepared to wait 2-3 hours and if friends were to visit town, they would probably want to spend their time elsewhere.",

I love how interactive it was, it made it exciting and fun! I wanted to try everything. They have a great selection of different types of meats. My fave was prob the beef belly and skirt steak. There are a few appetizers. \"The shit\" was recommended as a must try. I thought it was alright. As I ate on I started getting pretty full off meat and wanted some veggies but the options were limited. I settled for the house salad to get my veggie fix. I think maybe a couple more appetizer options or veggies would I give it 5 stars. All in all it was excellent from quality of food to service! It does get busy so there is a little bit of a wait time but get there early and it's not too bad. I do look forward to the ice cream coffee dessert at the end. I wish I can get seconds it so good!",

We chose the \"All Day Special\" for $21 per person because we absolutely love Kalbi (aka short ribs). We also loved the spicy pineapple steak!!!!!!!   This amazing deal included a list of appetizers and dessert. Both ice cream choices of their desserts was yummy!   Bottom line----Everything we ate here was super delicious (which made me so happy because not all buffets have good quality food).   Did I mention we came here twice during our trip? :P",

We tried the brisket, the pork belly, and the marinated spicy skirt steak. The brisket was very lean. Quoting my boyfriend, \"very frozen.\" It was so tough to eat. The pork belly was fine, but the spicy skirt steak came out in this weird worm like shape. We had to cut several times to finally get it into a size that's edible, and the marinade was weird. It had a really weird aftertaste.   Their side dishes also aren't great. The pickled radishes and jalapenos weren't pickled at all. The fish cake was really dry. Sberythibf  I guess we're spoiled since we eat Kbbq a lot in LA, but I wouldn't come back to this place even though they had pretty good service.",

There are just 2 restaurants in Vegas you struggle to find parking for... and they're in the same plaza. This Spring Mountain Chinatown plaza is POPPIN and sometimes I wonder why. The parking sucks, the restaurants are always packed and they aren't even that great... If you manage to get a parking spot you can eat dinner, have desert and have boba at the SUPPOSEDLY best Asian spots in Vegas all in the same plaza.  Showed up Saturday night at 730PM for a 40 minutes wait (table for 4) The wait at 9PM when we left was over an hour.  Hwaro is AYCE. At just over $20 for dinner and just under $20 for lunch, its cheap. The meat quality is decent, but not the best.  Lots of appetizers to choose from. Shake Shake rice was Korean style toasted rice with egg mixed in. Small portion, enough for 2 people. Stick with the Shake Shake rice. Their white rice is always awful. Wet, not sticky. There is a difference.  Start with bulgogi, beer tongue, brisket if you aren't feeling too ballsy. The other stuff can get pretty fatty and the consistency throws me off.  Only ice cream of affogato for dessert?! Where's my fried banana and mochi?!",

    "text": "As tourists to Las Vegas and avid fans of Korean BBQ, we were recommended Hwaro by a local. We are so so glad that we went.  We are from Texas and have had our fair share of Korean BBQ, and this is some of the best we've had. The meat is very juicy and cut thick, you have a wide variety of sides which are all very delicious. The all you can eat meal and price is a STEAL compared to ours back home. You get as much as you want of any side and meat and there's so many more choices to choose from.  The vibe of the restaurant is very nice. The music is great, the atmosphere is friendly. It's a relatively small restaurant, which is great because that means that it's not hard for a server to tell when you need anything and provide great service. That leads me to the best part of our whole experience--the service. We were so incredibly lucky to be sat with Tyler. He was very attentive to anything we needed and made great recommendations to us whether it was food or drinks! We hardly had to ask for anything because before we could even think to ask, he was already on top of it and getting it for us. Everyone else who helped us was nice too, but Tyler was our main server and he was AMAZING! I would go back again for the amazing service alone (okay, fine, for the delicious food... but the service is still incredible). If you come here, ask for Tyler! You definitely won't regret it.  Thank you, Hwaro and Tyler, for some of the best food and customer service that I have ever had. This was our first time coming to Hwaro, but after the great experience we had we know that it won't be our last. This is a new go-to place every time we come back to Las Vegas. :-)",

You will get good friendly and prompt service but wished that the crowds would go away as a 30 minute wait is typical.  The biggest plus is that AYCE is only $22.99 per person.  The meats and sides are standard.  Unfortunately, the \"premium\" steak which is limited to one person is pretty tough same as Gen.  However, for this price, you can't really go wrong.",

Been here a few times and we always receive excellent service from their staff. Especially this girl named Janice... Seriously! This girl does not slow down. She was working all the tables the last time we were there.   Must get: Brisket, Beef bulgogi, Green Mussel, Premium Steak (1 order per person), Enoki Beef (1 order per person), Korean Fried Chicken, The Shit, and Shake Shake Rice.

They also have unique dishes like \"The Shit\" and \"Hwaro Rice\" (they're marked with must try) and this is sooo True because these dishes are sooo amazing!  The service is awesome too, they came by to change our grills and take our orders in a fast and kind manner. The inside is gorgeous too-I love the intimate look!  They have a really good dessert called affogato ice cream, which is like a sweet coffee ice cream. They also have other options of ice cream for dessert as well.   For the meats, I love the quality of all of them. I especially like tripe and pork belly, but they have soo many options. It's all definitely worth a try!!",

So much fun grilling our own food! We both loved the marinated beef cuts the best. Delicious kimchi. Spicy! Such a great cough inducing spice level for most of our sides and meats.   Everything was too spicy for the kiddos but I just plied them with the \"all you can eat ice cream\" trick so the parental units could gorge in peace. Dang, I swear our 6 year old ate 6 cups of ice cream!   I highly recommend the affogato- vanilla ice cream with coffee and crunchy toppings (looked like honey bunches of oats cereal). Best meal in Vegas for this trip!",

    "text": "First meal of my 4 day weekend from California hustle & bustle (LABOR DAY - 8/30/19). We decided to try this place based off Yelp reviews. My friends who were also from out of town wanted to try this place.  We decided to go for lunch. The restaurant is located in a small plaza with other restaurants that share the parking area. The outside doesn't look appealing but it looks like this area can get really busy. Luckily we came during opening hours cause there was still ample parking (plus it was 1130am in 100 degree weather).  When we walked in, it was as expected from the Yelp photos. Clean and nice. Earthy decor and a big sakura tree was displayed in the middle of the dining area. That tree is great for photos, just a tip.  Our party chose to do the Lunch menu at $20, 44 items to choose from plus one dessert. They did have another option of an ALL DAY price of $23 with any additional 10 items.   We ordered pork belly, beef belly, brisket for our first round. They had two different dipping sauces, a premade salt/pepper/sesame oil & a sweet and salty sauce, but it was not teriyaki. It was different, but I liked it. We enjoyed the banchan while waiting for our meat. I love how every AYCE I've been to offers different types of banchan. The banchan included salad, kimchee, rice paper, radish paper, fish cake, cucumber kimchee with enoki mushrooms, and pickled onions. You can also order appetizers to share. We tried \"The Shit\" which was bomb. You have to try it. We tried the friend tofu (too dry), KFC Korean fried chicken which was like a chicken nugget, it was good.   The cuts of pork belly were thick and juicy. The beef belly was different than what I'm used to. It had more meat than fat, but it was still good. The brisket was the same as other places I've gone to. We tried the prime steak and green tea pork belly. The prime steak was tender and the pork belly had hints of green tea, not overwhelming.   After dinner we all enjoyed a scoop of ice cream. A few if us had green tea and the other have affogato (vanilla ice cream with coffee).  Overall the experience was great. I'm glad we tried this place with friends. The service was great. Attentive, friendly and efficient. The servers always checked up on us and refilled our water often. If you're even in town and want an AYCE KBBQ, stop by here cause not all KBBQ is AYCE.",

When we finally got seated, a few banchans were readily available. Menu is all you can eat. With dinner being 23.95 and lunch being 19.95. They have a wide variety of meats. Our go to is short rib, brisket, and tongue. Meats were good and the ones they were marinated; were seasoned well. I loved the green onions and sprouts side dish. Many other Korean bbq places don't have this. So this made me super happy. It also came in a huge bowl. It's a great pairing with the meat. Most of the banchans were great. Except the fish cake was a little hard. Only ding there. My brother in law loves the seafood salad. It's basically poke over salad. Come early and give this place a try.",

Really I don't want to review this place because it is so popular and by reviewing it I feel like more people will want to try it but I owe it to the people.  The only thing I was not crazy about was them not having leaf lettuce............ why YOU LOSE A STAR! Jk it's my own preference growing up but I understand everywhere is different. I'll just sneak in my own..... kidding... maybe..  My husband who is white didn't understand why we had to cook our own food but by the end of it decided it was pretty cool and galbi is his favorite!

Their other steaks are also really great and definitely worth trying. I also loved how they have so many side options. Garlic butter, fondue, the shit, and gyoza were all great. But my personal favorites are the corn cheese and the hwaro rice!   SERVICE 5/5: Exceptional service. I came here first with some friends. Half our party came very late, but our waiter was very patient & accommodating and allowed us to be seated first. Never had any trouble trying to get a waiter's attention. In fact, it was quite the opposite. Our waiter was so friendly and so attentive - kept checking up on us super often.   ATMOSPHERE 4.5/5: Inside is so cute!

The wait was about 40 mins with a group of 6 around 7pm on a Sunday night, which is typical for a small establishment.   The good: - Brisket (most of the time, however, we did get cuts with a lot of fat in them towards the end). - Beef tongue  - Hwaro spicy rice is a must!!!  - Beef belly  - Skirt steak - Rice paper (some places don't have this) - Steam egg - open late for those late night cravings (until 3am) - 15% off for military or first responder (per person) - service is good  The bad: - Time limit is 1 hour and 20 mins (it bothered us that this is the one place that actually will give u a last call on ordering even when there is no group waiting) - 15% service charge for groups of 4 or more - Fish cake is normally good but this time was very hard and chewy - inconsistent number or orders ( ordering 3 brisket one round was more than an order of 5 brisket)  Overall, I would come here again considering their meat quality have improved and we can't get enough of that Hwaro spicy rice!",

    "text": "Korean BBQ is absolutely amazing! If you haven't had Hwaro's you must try it. It's absolutely amazing, but you are cooking the meat and seafood yourself so be prepared. If it's undercooked you have no one else to blame. The experience is really cool they bring you all the meat you order raw and you put it on the center grill in front of you. It's a cool interactive experience and the meat is all very different and so good. The spicy pork bulgogi and the short ribs are amazing!   A cool thing we found out is that my girlfriend and my favorite sushi spot, sushi Neko is the sister restaurant to hwaro. They are run by the same owner and closer to the east side Sakana is another sushi spot run but the same owner. Obviously, the owner knows what they are doing because they are all so delicious. They did change up a few things at hwaro's that we noticed, the grills look like they have been placed deeper in the table probably for safety reasons and the way the meat is presented is on a large plank board now, which looks great to the eye. They seem to have enforced the hour time limit a little more which is understandable because they are so busy! It's also helpful for me so I don't come out feeling like a bowling ball! They also began putting the desert in to go cups to get guests out quickly. It seems to be more efficient at least with our experience it did.   Awesome experience and just one more thing, our server came once to take our first order and then they all seemed to assist us, but that's all it took. David was very charming and very well spoken, he did a great job. Great experience!",

Around dinner time it got busy, and we definitely had to wait. The lady though tried her best to accommodate us as quick as possible.   As we sat, we were greeted.  Once we ordered and since we had a larger party, the quantity would be smaller. But everything came out right away!  Quality of the meat was ok, but usually kbbq places have side sauces, which I felt like was lacking here because the meat wasn't really marinated.  I didn't have any favorites except for the daikon papers to enjoy with the meat and the affogato for dessert.   Service was very attentive but got to the point at the end where she asked us if we needed anything else every 10-15 minutes which made me feel rushed to leave.",

    "text": "This isn't the best kbbq ever, but you definitely get your money worth here. It is AYCE and they have a variety of meats along with appetizers. Come for lunch when its only $20! We came right when it opened at 11:00 am and there was no wait. We were given a two hour limit, but that was still enough time for our group of 7. By the time we left, all the tables were full and there was a line waiting. Come early since this place gets packed.   We ordered most of the appetizers (tofu bean paste soup, gyoza, bulgogi nacho, seafood salad, sweet & spicy tofu, The Shit, steamed egg). I would recommend passing on most of them and just sticking to the meat. None of us really liked the shit, it's just a deep fried sushi roll. Also on the seafood salad (basically a tiny poke salad). But do definitely get the soup, steamed egg, and corn cheese to dip all your meats in, it just adds another layer of flavor. The rest are more filler dishes but it's nice to have those options if you're tired of eating so much meat.   The brisket and pork belly were the best cuts of meats. The green tea smoked pork belly is something I normally don't see on the menu and it turned out ok. It's nice being able to try so many things. My group was stuffed by the end. Everything came right away, service was good here.   Tip: Yelp check in gets you a free drink - get the peach flavored soju. Its delicious and comes in a cute pink can.",

We paid full price and did not even come close to ordering a lot of meat.  We had a 7yr old child who still wanted more.   The A/C was working and it was hot a humid inside as well.   Too many options for this service. HWARO lost another Veteran and his extended family after this stunt.   You can be sure that every forum I belong to and every Veterans group will be advised to go elsewhere.

    "text": "I LOVE Kbbq! I'm originally from California and since moving to vegas I haven't found a Kbbq spot that truly hits the spot. I love eating things that most of my friends find questionable like intestines, and that was what lead me to Hwaro.   Here are some things that I really enjoyed at Hwaro: as soon as I walked in I was immediately pleased with the ambiance. I really like the outdoor/indoor vibe. The first thing you notice is the cherry blossom tree, and then the brick and cement accents making you feel like you're dining outside and it kinda also gives a street vibe. I also loved the entertainment. They had Kpop videos playing.   As far as food and service goes... the service was very quick, but I was quite disappointed that when I ordered intestines it never came and wasn't informed that they were sold out until towards the end of my meal (the main reason I'm giving 4 stars and not 5 considering I went to Hwaro solely because I was craving intestines and because it took me ordering it 3x for them to finally say they were out of it)... I was however very pleased with the fact they're the only place that offers rice paper. At the end of the day, I will be going back and hopefully this time I'll get all the intestines in the world hahaha.",

Our first choice was Mother's Korean but saw on Yelp that it had closed. We were sad.   Found Hwaro on Yelp with good reviews.  Good to go.  Had a little prob understanding the ordering.  The kids wanted to cook kalbi and pork belly and I wanted the ribeye steak.  I let my sister order and to my surprise, what she ordered was enough; sliced ribeye, pork belly, kalbi, baby octopus, calamari, chicken. Thankfully, the ribeye steak never made it to the table so I was able to cancel it. We were so full and had to roll out the door. We didn't smell like KBBQ which was nice. Definitely will try another restaurant in the AYCE family, next time we are in Vegas.",

The green tea smoked pork belly was my favorite.   I really appreciated that the menu gave a list of the different side dishes (kim chee, radish wraps, potato salad, etc.) I went through a ton of radish wraps all by myself (my husband doesn't eat vegetables, lol) They paired perfectly with the different meats. The only thing I didn't see was japchae. Did I miss it?   If ever we're in the area again, we'll definitely be back.

If they knew it was smoking burnt just make a new one geez!

Why let me wait to say they don't accept only 1 person, plus there's nothing in their restaurant that says so. Nothing that  says it has to be more than 1 person for the kbbq. This restaurant has excellent customer service to the max!!! I'm only giving 1 star coz I can't remove it already. But it is zero star!   I went to another kbbq  restaurant instead and it has an option for 1 person for the bbq. Expensive but worth it to satisfy the craving.",

We had to get up and roam around to find them so we can order more meat and refill the water. The basically forgot we were there. Also didn't get any tongs or scissors to cut and flip the food. So it stayed on the grill would almost burn.   Not worth your time and money! I will not be coming back.",

The meat was fresh and well seasoned and the side dishes (my personal fave) were all authentic and fresh as well.  The server changed out our grill frequently and even dealt with our multiple requests to lower or higher the heat (we just couldn't get that perfect temp where the meat cooks evenly and charr's the outside).  While I don't claim to know much about Korean food, I feel like I can give this a great rating.",

Also their menu says they charge a 15% gratuity for over 4 people. OVER 4 people, but even though there was only 4 of us they charged us 15%. I would have paid that if the service was decent, but since it was terrible I fought for it and said that it does not say 4 or more. The associate said they didn't know that the menu said that. I don't understand how some of the associates don't understand the meaning of OVER 4. I'm usually a great tipper.

Minimal side dishes for lunch--none of the sticky rice wrap thingies, no lettuce wraps. They mischarged us so we had to fix that... Otherwise the service was fine. We've only eaten at this Korean establishment in Las Vegas so there's no other places to compare... Maybe for this town this place is fine to go, but I'll never go back.",

There were people that got there after us that were waiting also, but for some reason we were the only once singled out to do so. We then asked how long til we get seated and the guy says we can only sit you on separate tables. Are you kidding me? They  pretended that they will accommodate us only to say that they really don't have a table for all of us because the long tables are reserved. Over the phone they said they don't take reservations. The staff were very rude and customer service is terrible. If they would have told us the minute we got there that they cannot accommodate us we would not have stood around for an hour for nothing.

We ordered Baby octopus, pork skin, short ribs, sliced rib eye, brisket, and more!! Our server was very friendly, attentive and accomodating. Our experience was great and food is awesome, even the water. Im surprised their water is NOT tap water!! The meat were marinated perfectly. The pork skin and the sliced rib eye....ughhh i cant get enough of them. Will definitely come back!!

I come here with my girls almost every week. Every time I come we have to wait about an hour which is pretty reasonable. Service is eh nothing special up to this point but I do see new faces. My server today, Gaeun, she was great! I came here with my best friends and she took care of us so well. It's so rare to find quality customer service but her service was top notch. As for food if you don't know what you think as her she will give you her honest opinion! Whoop Whoop! But food is great as usual I love their brisket and spicy pineapple beef steak! Only 20.95 per person and you get EVERYTHING on the menu. I most definitely will be hitting this place up again soon!",

Food is great & they have such a wide selection of appetizer & meat, so be sure to have an empty stomach before coming in here! I love their red wine pork belly, as well as their skirt steak.  Their customer service, however, is such a hit or miss. The past three visits for me has been such a disappointment. I understand if it's a busy night & all, but to forget an order & not checking in if we need water? It was annoying, but it's good that they were checking in on other customers except us  We had no water, empty plates were piling up, being gone for most of our dinner, & having to find you = not acceptable in my book. But thank you for your quick service as soon as we asked for dessert.",

    "text": "This was my second time to Hwaro. The first time I was here was last year. I discovered Hwaro since I browsing on Yelp to find a good Korean BBQ and of course, Yelpers didn't let me down. We went as a group of 4 in 2015 for dinner. We do the all day special which is only $3 more but you will have short ribs (without bones - can request bones-in if you want), and other specialty.  The quality is really good. I like all the side dishes. They are generous with salad to balance the meaty. They also have some items that is not served or offer at Omi or Jin in Dallas. I find out about pork cheek, which a type of bacon but more buttery and chewy. They marinated the meat very well. If you ever want a steak, come here and choose the premium steak, they literally brought out a 12 oz ribeye steak. Oh my god!! I was rolling my eyes. Since the recent time I only went with a friend, I told the waitress that she should only bring us a little of each items so we can try more items. However, I still feel it was too much for me because of their generous portion.  They have very good potato salad. My friend was on a low carb diet but after trying the potato salad, she order 2 more. That was how good it is.  I especially like the intestines, which I'm sure many people here find disgusting. But to be honest, Hwaro did a very good job of cleaning and marinated. It does not have that kind of smell and all was very fatty and crunchy. Don't over order this item even though you like it, it's very fatty and unhealthy. Just eat a little bit to satisfy your craving and move on their other delicious items!  Oh, and you guys should always try the Sh!t (lolz), yup, a very memorable named item on the menu. Limit 1 per table. For me, it's ok but the name stays on my mind till now.  I'll make my way back to Hwaro each time I come back to Vegas for sure",

We were constantly reminded every 2 to 3 minutes that they have other guest waiting outside and that they like to entertain them as well. long story short, from my perspective 9 out of every 10 customers that leaves HWARO is no doubt with an indigestive stomach or with ulcer!

Not exaggerating this place has 40+ things on their menu. While the cheapest one has 15+  items on their menu - i will up date these numbers for more accuracy next time.  Currently $19(happy hour) and $22(regular hour).  Meat Quality: 7/10.... My 10/10 meat quality KBBQ places are usually not AYCE. However, there is only one AYCE KBBQ with better meat quality than this place, all others are equall or below Hwaro. So, it actually is a 9/10 quality among AYCE KBBQ.  My only problem is, this place almost always has a loooooong line during meal times.. but that proves how popular this place is.",

When I come here, I always order the steamed egg (which I adore), brisket, pork belly, skirt steak, and spicy skirt steak. I tend to order the same things when I go to Korean BBQ, but I really like this place because the meats have excellent marbling, and you can really tell that the quality of the meat is superior. This is by far one of my favorite places to get Korean BBQ, and I would highly recommend it.",

Their meat is fresh and well seasoned, and the appetizers/extras are amazing! I love the shake shake rice and kfc. The  s**t is my favorite item they have and I usually order a ridiculous amount of it when I'm there.   My only issue is that I usually have to wait at least 40 minutes to be seated. With how much business they're bringing in, I wish they could relocate to a bigger location.   Nothing beats Hwaro!",

I have lived here two years and this is the first place to remind me of home. They offer so much on their menu, it's actually WAY more than I've ever seen.. and all at the all you can eat price!   There are a couple downsides. One being the wait, but it was during the weekend so as long as you are prepared to wait, you'll be okay. And two, the music was so loud! I felt like I was at a club!

Every time I've come here the staff is always fun and friendly.  I've never had a hint of a bad attitude, and sometimes if I'm dancing or singing to a song they will join in. (Only a couple times though) They always treat my daughter well and give her ice cream, even though she's 3 and gets to eat for free.  The food there is amazing, all the other kbbq places in Vegas are a dollar or two more, and don't have the selection that Hwaro provides. (besides Gen as they are the same price and both have large selections.) They also have the best range of appetizers you can get at a kbbq place, and they are well known for them.   For the price of the dinner and the value of the food, this place is well worth giving a try.  And it shows with how busy they are nights & weekends.  I will sit and wait for an hour after fighting people in the parking lot for a spot thats how good Hwaro is!",

    "text": "One of my favorite food is Korean BBQ.  I experience several Korean BBQs around Las Vegas and have my own preferences to a good Korean BBQ.  Hwaro, another Korean BBQ restaurant that offers one menu where you can order various meat. They supply many side dishes like many KBBQ restaurants such as Radish Warp, Cheese Corn, and etc.  Before, the restaurant had a different name called Korean Delicious or something similar to that name.  I'm not sure if it's the same establishment or if they changed it, but now it is called Hwaro.  You cook the meat yourself like many other KBBQ restaurants, and we  ordered meat for example, Beef Tongue, Brisket, and Pork Belly.  The first time I went, we also ordered Shake Shake Rice, where you actually shake the container to mix up the rice with egg.  In Korean, it is called Dosirakwhich means LunchBox. After the shake, the yolk mixes with the rice, gochujang, and other ingredients.  I'm weak to spiciness so it was a little spicy to me, but if you can deal with spiciness then you'll love it if you also love egg and rice.  It's a fun way to make the dish~  I've seen Shake Shake Rice only in videos from Korea or different state, so I was excited that I was able to experience the Shake Shake Rice. UPDATE (September 2018) They don't serve the Shake Shake Rice anymore, but they have Hwaro House Rice which is similar, but without the tin box.  My friend had been there before and she told me that the Steamed Egg had an after taste of Cheese to her.  After I tried the dish, I taste a little bit of Cheese as a aftertaste.  It seemed more well cooked compare to the other Steamed Egg I had where you can see more of the broth.  They give you a good amount of meat, so you do not feel overwhelm with all the meat.  When I went, you had to write your name on the list if they have lots of people waiting.  It was a nice lively place, it can be a bit loud, but the Food was Delicious~ For Dessert, I ordered the Matcha Ice Cream.",

Prices are understandable however service can be a tad bit better, was a few times when I would order a drink and have to ask for it again or have dishes missing. Quality of meat is pretty standard and you do get a large variety of choices for the price. PARKING as always is a pain here and you should expect at least 5 mins or more just searching for an open stall. Please do not park on the sides of the walls or unmarked areas as I have seen cars getting hit that were parked in places they shouldn't have been. Be prepared for an additional wait as there is almost always at least a 30 minute wait time for this place so note that in advance  Overall though place is good and will be here pretty often :D",

    "text": "Having been to Gyukaku, Yagyu(closed), Honey Pig, Tofu Hut, Korean Garden BBQ House, Sura and Gangnam, I feel like Hwaro is just another mediocre addition to AYCE BBQ spots in Vegas.   SERVICE  Best one by far, compared to other BBQ spots around town. We had about 3 servers constantly checking on us. All of them were friendly and attentive. Thumbs up for their service!  CLEANLINESS  Took a star off of this. I understand it is difficult to deal with oily stuff. Table was all oily but that's expected (I would appreciate if they took more time wiping the table). What I can't stand was the floor covered in oil. One of the server slipped by our table because of how oily the floor was. We had multiple servers telling us to watch out the step and I was scared getting up from the table. The floor was so slippery! Perhaps wood floor is a bad idea for BBQ place? Or they just have to clean more? I don't know how they can solve this but they definitely need to do something about it before someone gets hurt. My tip would be to wear a slip-resistant shoes. Any shoes with grip will work.   FOOD Another star off. We ordered short ribs, marinated pork and brisket. Nothing spectacular. You get banchan like any other KBBQ place. I would say the quality of the meat didn't match the price. Considering Tohu Hut has a late night special for $13.99 AYCE, I would much rather deal with their rude  service than to pay over $20 for AYCE BBQ that is about the same quality, if not Hwaro is slightly better. I also wouldn't mind paying a little extra and go to Gyukaku, Honey Pig or Korean BBQ House for better quality meat.   CONCLUSION I wouldn't mind giving them a second chance but there's definitely a better AYCE BBQ options in Vegas so this place wouldn't be my first choice. Quality wise, Gangnam, Honey Pig and Gyukaku would be my top choices. Tohu Hut or Hwaro if you are feeling broke/just want to get your BBQ craving satisfied.",

That's one of the BEST things on the menu.   Other menu favourites: Potato Salad Corn Cheese and Garlic Butter Gyoza Brisket SHORT RIBS! - my personal favourite Spicy Pineapple Beef Steak  (not too spicy) Bean paste soup - excellent and piping hot, also spicy.  The new menus say there's a time limit, but it's really not enforced so don't mind that. Sodas are canned and $1.50 each, which is a bummer, but with all the different flavours I always chug the water anyway. Groups of 4 or more are charged a 15% \"service fee\" and you can't fly solo here, probably due to its popularity.",

Everyone knows what an AYCE KBBQ place is. What makes this place different? They have about 8-10 BBQ seating sets. They have a large variety of meats that are unique from other places. Example? They have wine marinated pork belly, green tea marinated pork belly, and marinated baby octopus. They bring out the soup and steamed egg without request and they have a large variety of sides. One of the sides they bring out is cheesy cream corn that gets heated on the grill! The two times I've been there the service was good. The staff is nice and they actually have a lot of workers.   At all of the different KBBQ places there are things I don't like. I either don't like their meat, their sides, or their service. I just like it here. Since you cook your own most places don't come by much so it's hard to get refills, napkins, ect.  I just like this place. They have your utensils and napkins on the table in a container. They give you a pitcher of water so you don't need the server for refills. Their meat selection is not only large but tasty. You won't get bored. Plus the price is right. I was scared to post a review because I like not having to wait for a spot but the secret is out.",

I liked cooking our meat at the table. If I have one issue is that I wish they would explain what ALL the meat selections are. But that is a super small thing. I must say I was so happy with our choice on where to go for dinner. Can't wait to go again.",

The skirt steak and the premium steak is always great too! We can't go more than two weeks without stopping by at this point!   The meat is always fantastic and the service is normally pretty fast. They are really good to ask if you would like more meat and they change the grills frequently. This is hands down our go to place for Korean BBQ!",

    "text": "$19.99 for All You Can Eat (AYCE) Korean BBQ (KBBQ)? Hell to the yes!   This place offers quality grilled meats at a huge value! The all you can eat deal is definitely the way to go; the meal is actually a feast and comes with a few complimentary dishes, but I wouldn't sweat trying to force down everything, especially if meat is on your agenda. They also offer a good variety of traditional banchan (side dishes) that all tasted fresh and authentic. Our favorites were the kimchi and the bean sprouts - both extremely flavorful! You can also request some garlic and jalapenos to grill up! That's our favorite thing to do and pairs deliciously with grilled meat.   Of all meats we tried, I preferred the meats from the non-marinated \"plain\" section, I found them to be fresh and I loved being able to dip them in the table sauces and control my salt intake. The pre-marinated meats were a tad too salty for me. Make sure to try half-portions of the meat so that you have room to try more! Luckily my friend Philip T. gave us this tip, so we didn't have to break our bellies to try everything.   Here's what we tried:  *Pork shoulder butt - unbelievably buttery! I loved dipping this in the sesame oil salt 5/5  * Hwaru pork belly - super thin pork belly that looks like bacon! Flavor was very buttery and slightly sweet. 5/5  *Marinated pork rib - great flavor and very juicy meat, but maybe too chewy for me 3/5  *Short rib (bone) - great meaty flavor and juicy, but this one was also a tad too chewy for my preference 3/5   *Sweet spicy pork - very tender and nice sweet and spicy flavor, yet it was a little too salty for us 4/5  *Spicy baby back ribs - tender and super meaty again, slightly too salty for us 4/5  Complimentary sides: * Doenjang Jjigae (Korean fermented soybean paste stew) - traditional and very comforting! I loved sipping the hot broth 5/5  * Gyeran jjim (Korean steamed fluffy egg casserole) - super fluffy! 5/5  * Salad - simple but fresh with a tangy light dressing. Great balance to all of the meat! 4/5  * Corn cheese - A traditional bar type food, with average flavor 3/5  * Pumpkin sikhye - chilled sweet pumpkin dessert drink. It's simple, but a great palate cleanser after all of that meat! 4/5  We really adored the waitress who tended our table, cooking our meat for us; she was very friendly, helpful and informative. Plus the overall service was extremely prompt and polite from the entire staff during our dinner. Any sides or sauces we needed were refilled immediately with no down time. We also enjoyed the trendy ambiance and all of the nerdy comics and posters scattered about. We really felt that they appreciated us for dining there and that left a great first impression on us! I've only had a handful of KBBQ dining experiences in Las Vegas, but I honestly think this one has been my favorite so far! I'm already thinking about what I'm going to try the next time I visit.",

    "text": "I would say one of the better kbbq spots in comparison with other spots in Vegas. No where else.  Positives:  -Fresh meat -Recommend: Skirt steak. Juicy, even when cooked medium well. -Variety of appetizers: -Kfc chicken was my favorite  -\"The shit\" was a second runner up. I'm not quite sure what it was that they put inside but I believe it was some type of meat or shrimp since it tastes similar to fried seaweed shrimp rolls they have at many dim-sum place  -Food quality matches the price, we paid about $22 each (which is still a little much) for a party of 7.   Negatives: -Just like many Korean bbq places: Service. -They closed down the kitchen, without giving us last call. Made us disappointed because my boyfriend was unable to get ice cream & I did 5 minutes before him. Also because it was only 1AM & they close @ 3AM. Sucks. -Includes gratuity for parties of 4 or more. -Very unfortunate that they didn't nail the brisket. -They also don't carry brisket sauce.  -Many of the appetizers included on the menu that we wanted, (brisket nachos & I forgot the other one) they didn't have. -Also didn't have the other ice cream flavors listed on the menu, only green tea. -They don't have an extensive menu for the \"special\" menu. I.E: Beef tongue only included for lunch.  Overall, 3/5 experience. They should look into telling customers what they do & do not have before ordering.",

This place gets busy because like I said, it's the best in town, so be prepared to wait or come on the less busy times. If u come a little before the dinner rush, you will be seated promptly. Just a side notes for families w small kids: We have two babies and unlike other restaurants in Chinatown, they have plenty of high chairs but not much space for storage of strollers. Best to carry the babies instead of taking them in strollers.",

It wasn't very busy when we arrived and had about 3 parties ahead of us waiting for a table. The greeters were very short and told us to sit down at what already looked like a table where we would be eating so it seemed unclear as to whether we were waiting for service or just a table.  We waited about 25 minutes before anyone even acknowledged us and we were ushered to our table. Our waiter was very nice and checked on us fairly often. The food was great. The marination and flavor of the meats were great and the selection of the appetizers were numerous. The chicken was so soft and melted in my mouth. When I asked for a refill of the fish cakes, I got a plate double the size of the original filled with fish cake.   Great spot for the food, but I don't think I would come back here considering how long I would have to wait. There are plenty of other Korean BBQ places I could go to with a significantly shorter wait time and better service.",

We got brisket, beef tounge, ribye, tripe and baby octopus Overall it was good, good selection of meats, the baby octopuswas good which my husband enjoyed.  They have a variety of sauces served at your table depending on your preference.  The salad was good but not as good as tofu Hut's salad.  LOVE that they changed our grill 2x without having to ask them.    Cons: If you love tripe (like the one from tofu hut which is sadly my favorite) you'd be very dissapointed because what they served us was something i've never seen before.. It was huge like a sausage link and had fat inside so I was very bummed they don't have the tripe that I'm used to at other korean bbq places... :(",

For it being a small place,  it isn't overly crowded or anything.  The presentation when you're first seated is nice too.  I wasnt expecting there to be sides on the table already. The things I really liked was the spicy pork bulgolgi and  the steamed egg. 'The shit' was pretty bomb too. I wasnt a fan of the beef skirt although they recommend it. It was a big portio,  but I wasn't impressed by it.    Service was really good. The staff are very attentive. The price was good for AYCE too.  It was a little over $24 with taxes.

    "text": "Not bad, Hwaro!   I'll be honest, the first time I came to Hwaro I left before ordering... Due to an \"unfortunate circumstance\" they were not serving any alcohol. I was with two of my Korean friends who wanted soju and were very disappointed they couldn't order alcohol. We left and ventured off to Woonamjung's further down Spring Mountain for AYCE KBBQ and multiple bottles of soju.  I was bummed about leaving because I've been wanting to try Hwaro and heard nothing but good things from my Korean coworkers. I finally tried Hwaro this week and was not disappointed!   The salad that comes with the KBBQ tasted average. On the other hand, the banchan was on point! Pretty tasty! A nice variety of side dishes were provided and the servers were nice about replenishing them when requested.   Servers came by our table frequently - at least 4 different people visited throughout our dinner. They were fantastic and quickly fulfilled our requests (water, sauces, additional side dishes, etc). We were never waiting and they even came by to change out our grill.   For meat, I'm all about the brisket and don't crave anything else (kalbi, bulgogi, pork belly, etc). My friend I was with ordered all sorts of meat selections ranging from cuts of flank steak, intestine, to pork skin. I enjoyed the brisket... It was fatty (which I ate around) but also very tender. The flank was great and the intestine was interesting. I didn't try the pork skin but my friend enjoyed it. I also didn't try any of the marinated meat so unfortunately I can't speak for the kalbi or bulgogi.   Hwaro gets 4 stars from me. The banchan and prompt service gets a 5. Both were much better than some of the Korean AYCE BBQ restaurants I've been to in the city. The meat gets a 3.5. I enjoyed my experience at Hwaro and would definitely consider coming back!",

    "text": "Hwaro has been my number one choice for AYCE KBBQ in Las Vegas for about 3 years now and for good reason. Although the crowds around the late evening are expected, I was happy with the updated wait system. The hostess has you enter your name and phone number onto a tablet and your are sent a text with an estimated wait time. A link is also provided to see where you are at in the waiting line. This is a huge improvement from the typical pen and paper sign in they used to have as you have the freedom to do something while you wait as opposed to sitting their waiting for your name to be called because you did not want to be skipped over. As usual, the service was fantastic. Our waiter this visit was Jitto and he was attentive, friendly, and made the overall experience better than any other Hwaro experience I have had before. Onto the food. For the appetizers, we ordered the Shake Shake Rice and The Shit (Crab meat wrapped in seaweed and deepfried, MUST TRY), and corn cheese. We ordered rice paper and a lot of the potato salad side dish as well. Hwaro seems to do their potato salad differently but in a delicious way! For the meats, we ordered brisket, pork shoulder, beef belly, spicy pork bulgogi, bulgogi, premium steak, and skirt steak. We ordered several servings of each meat of course. The marinated meat all tasted delicious and didn't taste too saucy. Everything we ordered tasted delicious, it's KBBQ! Another fantastic Hwaro trip and we'll be back again.",

We are there to eat, and we will pay if we dont finish it if anything? I dont think thats even right to say to your customers. AFTER THAT SERVING I LITERALLY LOST MY APPETITE AND DIDN'T ORDER ANYMORE. I used to love this place, we used to go here every other week, but as the service is getting bad i wouldn't recommend it anymore.

Yes, the wait may have been a hour for 2 people on a Thursday night, but what do you expect during the holidays?   The quality of the meat didn't leave me feeling nauseous like other all you can eat KBBQ restaurants, service was spectacular even though they were crazy packed. Never once did I feel neglected or forgotten and we were sat in the back corner. The $22.95 price can't be beat for 56 dinner items, you can't go there and not find something that you like. And when they say \"must try\" you don't ignore that. The shake shake rice was AH-MAZE-ING. I could have cared less for \"The Shit\" but only because I'm not a fan of shellfish. My friend loved it though so that's confirmation enough that it's The Shit, haha.   I'm not too sure if it's because I live in Hawaii and we have yet to experience AYCE KBBQ like the west coast, but my mind seems to be blown every time I take a trip to the mainland.",

In my case, my friend and I got an area of the restaurant that has a \"private room\" feel to it because of the dividers separating us from other people dining in.  The meat did not look questionable in quality, which made me feel better about going all out here. The pork and squid take the longest to cook, but they're SO worth it. I suggest getting the fast-cooking items, like the brisket, while you wait for the other things to cook so you're not waiting hungry.  A few notable items on their menu were:  The spicy chicken: it had a unique flavor that's hard to describe with words and it wasn't too spicy for my palate. There's no need to dip it in any sauce because it's already flavorful as is.  The butter fly (the shoulder part of pork): like I said before, pork is the longest cooking item on the menu. You can't be too careful with pork, so we let it cook for a while. It's savory & tender without the overbearing fat flavor.  The enoki beef: this is my FAVORITE thing on their menu. The beef was tender and had the melt-in-your-mouth factor to it. The mushrooms enhanced the flavor even more, giving it a richer flavor. It's a shame that it's only one order per person because this is the best tasting thing I've ever had at a Korean BBQ place!  With friendly service, quality menu items at a decent price, and a spacious & modern interior you can't beat it! This is hands down my new favorite KBBQ place in Chinatown.",

Servers are very friendly and the portions are definitely fulfilling. They are not stingy about how much you can order at a time which is great because other places are known to do that. Only downside is that there is quite a wait pushing the later hours, especially on the weekends. Sometimes it'll be around 30-45 minutes but it's worth the wait!",

WARNING :  if you're 21 and older and looking to have a drink, you gotta wait.  They are in the process of renewing their liquor license ... ugh (they would've got another star,  but I couldn't drink with my meal .. major party foul).   The food and service is good.  They weren't really busy when we were there so if we needed anything it was easy to get someone's attention.  One thing is they have some not so common names on the menu like \"act like a Korean\", which was spicy ribs lol or \"fat ass\" marinated pork belly.      Another change is no dessert, which they had before ... but I'm ok with that.  We are usually way too stuffed to fit in dessert.    Also if you never been to AYCE Korean BBQ be prepared to smell like it all the way home ... hahaha",

The side dishes are pretty good too, especially the salads. For 21 bucks, you really can't go wrong! I highly recommend their skirt steaks(normal, spicy ,and pineapple) .

Also, I didn't even finish my beer.  **  Came in at about 10:45 pm on a Friday night. The wait was about 10 minutes. Not that bad. Busy / crowded parking lot.  I came back to the same plaza the next night and there were a lot of people waiting outside, so maybe we just got really lucky. Not sure if they take reservations, but write your name down when you go in.  The lettuce and veggie bowl are both pretty good. Lots of side dishes for you. And an all you can eat menu. :~) Yay!!  For lunch and late nights, there's an all you can eat buffet menu for $17.95, which is amazing!! To eat everything on the menu, it's $20.95.  The meat is really good and they change the metal plate for you every time. Also order their shake shake rice!! Really good, but not one order per table. They have so many options to choose from.  Things that we've ordered so far:  - Green tea smoked pork belly (Didn't taste the green tea but it was still good) - Regular pork belly - Brisket (Yum!) - Hwaro Spicy Pork Rib (Also yum!) - The Shit (Ugh, sooo good. I thought we were limited to only one, but I misread the menu. Getting more of these next time. Also the sauce is amazinggg.) - Shake shake rice (Get this too)  I think we order about 8 meats for 2 people and we were stuffed after. My bf ended up eating a lot of white rice LOL. It was his first time eating KBBQ.  Out of all the KBBQ's I've eaten in my life, this place is one of my favorites.  Customer service is pretty good. A bit hard to get the waiter's attention sometimes, but I think it's partly because there's more tables than employees.  Also, get dessert. Because why not???",

    "text": "Imagine a place where you are presented with an endless array of meat options and appetizers to choose from. Not only that, but you can keep on ordering as much as you want for the low low price of around $23. Well my friend, I am here to tell you that this place does exist and it's called Hwaro.   AYCE Korean BBQ has always been a weakness of mine. I have a special fond spot in my heart for grilled meat, so it's always been like we're a match made in heaven. Anyways, Hwaro offers an extensive menu with many meat options, appetizers, and a few desserts to choose from. Most of these items can be ordered as many times as you'd like, but there's a few that are restricted to one order per person. Grilling is done by you or anyone at your table, so it creates a fun and interactive experience for your party.   When choosing meats, you should know that you're either getting marinated or unmarinated meat. Personally, I like to start with the unmarinated meat, such as the brisket or pork belly, which I then dip into the dipping sauces they provide for you. Starting with the unmarinated meat keeps the grill clean, and makes sure none of the tastes are really conflicting with each other. However, if your grill does become burnt or messy, don't fret. You can always request a grill change, and they will bring a clean one for you.   Still conflicted on what to try? Here's a list of some of my personal favorite items off the menu:  Appetizer: - Bean Paste Soup -Steamed Egg -The Shit  Meat: -Brisket -Pork Belly -Skirt Steak -Short Rib -Spicy Pineapple Beef Steak -Enoki Beef  These are just a few of my favorites, but it's a good place to start. I hope that all of you become as addicted to KBBQ as I am. Keep on grillin'!",

The beef brisket is like a frozen beef and they shaved it hence they can't marinate as it is as thin as a paper but for the price is a good enough all you can eat BBQ. Also you will smell smoke as soon as you get out. Your clothes, bags, hair etc smells like bbq smoke. I had to take shower when I get home as I can't stand the smell. Their exhaust system is not good. They need to do something about that. Overall I had fun because I was with my family other than that the food is mediocre. It's good for a try or with friends.",

The meat is pretty good.  Unfortunately when we asked for seconds of two of the items, they gave us seconds of everything AND in bigger portions than the first time so we couldn't try anything else.  It was good, but we would have liked to try a few more things.    The shake shake rice was very good.  Highly recommended.    Table wasn't too clean, but it's Korean BBQ so it's oily.  Service was decent.",

This is one of the few places that offer appetizers as well. There's something for everyone! We love the KFC, steamed egg, and the sh!t.   The side dishes are the best in Vegas, hands down. We are obsessed with the potato salad & their green salad!   They also offer a few desserts. The ice cream affogato is a must try! So refreshing and great to eat after all he KBBQ!   Lastly, their service is outstanding! Every time we go, all the staff is incredibly helpful and attentive. They are always available to take orders, and refill water/sides.   I will definitely be back and 100% refer them to anyone wanting a great AYCE KBBQ experience!",

Seriously, once we stopped looking at JUST the strip district options, our dining experiences got far more varied and we enjoyed ourselves much more. This is not to knock some of the great restaurants on the strip but it's definitely worth it to check out Hwaro and get a better feel for the variety of dining in the whole area. The price of the all-you-can-eat Korean bbq for dinner was in the low twenties and everything we tried was absolutely fantastic. Make sure to factor in an hour or so to wait during evenings if you're not able to get there during off times since they definitely don't take reservations.",

Upon walking in no one welcomed us, said hi or even acknowledged us. After standing there for a couple minutes a last said to write our name on the board and that was it. She didn't tell us how long the wait was or anything she just walked away. All the workers were just really rude and did not smile . (They weren't even that busy and they had about 5-6 workers). Finally I asked a guy standing near the register how long the wait was and he said 30 minutes just throwing out a number . I asked him if the other names on the list have been seated already and he said \"I don't know.\" He just seemed very lost and no idea about anything. I didn't understand when there were so many open tables . Then we saw a couple just walk in sat themselves at the booth. As if maybe they were their friends or something??  Because no one called them to be seated or anything. We ended up walking out because they were not friendly and no one acknowledged our existence . The atmosphere was just ok to be honest. Wasn't any super nice decor or mood music , nothing special.",

In fact, there are several All You Can Eat Korean BBQ restaurants such as Kimchi at the Strip, Gen at Henderson, and Honey Pic at Spring Mountain. There is one reason why Hwaro is my favorite. Their beef belly menu item is really awesome. Every time when I visit there, I order the beef belly at least 4 times. As I mentioned, it is All You Can Eat which means I can order as many times as I want. To describe about the beef belly, it is served as a plain and rare meat so the customers should grill themselves. Color is red and white with marbling, and the appearance is a long stripe which cut into really thin slice. One order comes with one or two stripes. After grilled, the smell is really grilled and delicious. For the taste of the menu, since it has about half fat and half meat, it is really easy to chew. My favorite sauce when eating Korean BBQ is the bean paste sauce which makes the plain meat with soy and sweet flavor. Adding more, typical Korean BBQ meal has not only just meat, but also other side dishes such as kimchi, fish tofu, bean paste soup, steamed egg, lettuce, rice paper, and etc. The price is quite reasonable and low which is about $19.99 to $23.99 for All You Can Eat. Other than beef belly, there are about 10 more items for BBQ and much more for appetizers. The dessert choices are either ice cream or afogato. Afogato is a scoop of vanilla ice cream with espresso in a small cup which was really tasty. I highly recommend this place for Korean BBQ place.",

The one downside was that we waited almost 1.5 hours for a table. We noticed that seating was too efficient as there were no tables for 2 people so they took up the 4 seaters which delayed the wait. As well, they have this really long table in the middle of the restaurant which takes up a lot of space but wasn't functional.  On to the positives, the food was great. The selection was quite large (compared to Canadian KBBQ) and everything tasted great! The shake shake rice was different and tasty. The skirt steak so tender. I only wish we had more time to visit again as we weren't able to try everything on the menu.  Would definitely go back if we're ever in the area again.",

We really wanted AYCE bbq since we went on a 4 hr long hike and after taking a nap we just wanted to feast. We thought about Tofu Hut but we can never get in because they're always packed.  So to sum it down, atmosphere is nice. The price for AYCE is decently priced. The meat selections are very delicious! The unfortunate part is their selection is small.  Lots of appetizers, I especially loved their kimchi because it wasn't too sweet or too sour/spicy.  Service was excellent as well! Definitely coming back! Next time I want to try their Mackerel combo.",

Their banchan is far superior to any other place I've been to in the city, and this is a huge plus for me. They also give free soup and steamed egg, which I think is a fantastic value considering they also offer cheaper prices than many others.  The meat is solid, but not great, and the service is ok - very friendly, but not very attentive. They do tend to forget about you a bit when they get busy.  Bottom line: dollar-for-dollar, this is an excellent deal and I highly recommend it.",

    "text": "Hwaro is one of the places that pop up whenever I am craving for some good and cheap kbbq in the Vegas area. Their all day special at $23 has a decent selection of meats while being really tasty compared to some other places that charge a bit more. Going here for lunch has never really been an issue for me in terms of wait time, but it does get busy around 5-6 when people go here for dinner. Parking is also an issue since it is located in a small plaza.  I recommend getting the brisket, enoki beef, skirt steak, premium rib, and the shake shake rice box. The brisket here is pretty tasty and juicy. Enoki beef is also good, but it sucks that you are limited to only one order per person. The shake shake rice box is basically a box filled with rice, kimchi sauce, and comes with an egg. It goes well with the meat you will be cooking. I'd opt for the shake shake rice instead of just eating a plain bowl or rice or using rice paper.  Overall, I would recommend this place to anyone who is craving for some kbbq. Service is great and the place is clean. Their prices are competitive and the food is good so what else could you ask for?",

You go here for the AYCE ( All You Can Eat). If you don't walk out of here feeling like you want to pop, you did it wrong.   Some great recommendations are:   1) Red Wine Braised pork - it will melt in your mouth.  2) must get the Shake Shake rice box.  3) Seaweed Salad  4) poke salad  5) The Shit 6) all of their porkbelly - flavors they have  7) get the garlic butter and corn cheese. Then you grill the garlic over the fire",

Brings back memories when I was crazy for Kpop music and still occasionally listen to it. However, my main reason for this particular visit was for an AYCE Korean BBQ meal. It's been awhile I haven't had Korean BBQ, overall it was an ok experience. We got a variety of meats but nothing really stood out with the exception of the beef tongue, which was really good.   They had a good variety of Banchan but the salad was delicious with a good amount of dressing and lettuce pieces that were fresh. The sesame oil dipping sauce that was provided was an excellent condiment that paired well with various meats especially with the beef tongue. Portion was quite generous but didn't have the same quality that you would expect from many Korean BBQ restaurants. The price point is what really draws a lot of people here, especially millennials looking to experience Korean BBQ. Do expect to wait to be seated especially during peak times since this place is located in the same plaza with many popular foodie joints.   My only complaint was the service, there were times when the servers never came around and the constant flagging a server to help us was a bit frustrating. Other than that, Hwaro is a descent choice when your craving for a mountain of Food but for now I'm going to think twice about going back again.   2017 Yelp Review #47",

Order the garlic butter and the ribeye and or brisket. Dip your meats in this yummy goodness   2.garlic jalapeno beef belly,pork belly,short ribs   3.steamed egg/ I like to eat the steamed egg with rice and a bite of meat (dipped in a sauce of course)  Try all the sauces sesame oil and salt, soy bean paste,house sauce is bomb too.  Dip your meats and try them out it's super fun experiencing it ..have some fun with your food while cooking it. I can't wait until I come back again",

Pretty clean, floor always feels slippery for some reason.  The meat quality is hit or miss sometimes, sometimes really really good, sometimes the brisket is super chewy.   Servers are decent for the price of AYCE so it kinda evens out.   Music is super loud sometimes, I'm making this while inside, and it is super super loud right now lol.  Me and my girlfriend always rotate between Hwaro and Doh, on Rainbow.   Doh is our first choice and Here is our second choice.  Happy eating!",

Nothing really stuck out to me. I was a little weirded out seeing the beef tongue so frozen that it broke like glass when you touched it. Plus if you cook it too long it would turn rubbery.   The menu also came with a small cheese corn, steamed egg, and soup which was plus for me! I also liked their banchan sides.   The service was good. They changed our grills whenever we asked.",

The price is $21 pp. When we were there, they offered free beer for rating them on YELP and posting the review (doesn't make sense because you would only rate once you've tried them). The service was great. They have about 52 selections but most are apps and the starters (how can you count those?). But there's more than enough meat to choose from and good cuts. My recommendations:  Beef Tongue Enoki Beef Sliced Ribeye Kalbi (of course)  Free dessert with buffet Vanilla IC with Coffee and Green Tea IC.   I would visit this place again when I'm in Vegas.",

They revamped the menu recently; it is more clear and straight forward.   We were here at dinner, it wasn't too crowded, and we were seated in 10 minutes. I did not have the same server as last time (but he was there), the server I did have did very well. The plates of meat we ordered took a while to come out, so things seemed to be slowed down by the kitchen.   I love the side dishes they offer, especially the pickled onion - I could eat that on everything.   I'm glad I was convinced to return, but I caution that you should only go during normally busier hours, service may be lacking during those off times.",

We stopped talking, finished our food and left. The food was so so, nothing to brag about. I'd rather pay a little more and enjoy the meal and converse with my friends in much civilized atmosphere.

My personal experience, when we got there no one greeted us. When we were showed to our table the host realized he placed us at the wrong place and asked us to get up and move. He did not apologize but laughed about his own mistake.   (Okay some positives:) The meats came out very fast. Fresh and thick cuts. Great seasoning dipping sauce. Simple but delicious side dishes like kimchi, potato salad, fish cake, etc. I appreciated how they changed our pan when it got burnt. . .  However, they forgot our order of corn fondue. This was probably the only thing I was excited to try. But they forgot to bring it to us? We reminded the server this the second time but yet nothing came. Very disappointing.  My sister and I were consistently eating and were interrupted by their 2 hour rule. Totally understand but it's Korean BBQ! It takes time to cook raw meat! I felt like it was rudely advised. She bent over and said, \"You are over your time, I'll bring you desert! What flavor ice cream do you want?!\" I never felt so shocked in a restaurant like this. So we had no option but we were definitely were slowly being kicked out.   When she dropped off our ice cream, my sister and I were just scarfing food trying to finish. While the ice cream just melted beside us.   I kept this to myself for the respect of my sister. I honestly felt like the customer service was lacking. Food and quality is great!

They have very interesting items on their menu such as the KFC and the shake shake rice that I enjoyed.   Our last visit we came in at 10:30 pm and the place was PACKED. We waited around 40 minutes or so until we're finally seated. Food was decent as usual and their service was always on the slower side because it's a busy place.   When we were finished with our meal and were about to pay, the server saw that we're doing split check and told us split check can only be done at the cashier. I found it odd at the moment because we've done split check before at this place and had the server brought us back the check. We did not think much at the time and left our table and went to the cashier. At the cashier they told us that their system went down and they could not do credit card at the moment. It was a late night dinner and none of the people in our party had cash. There was a woman working there that seemed to be the manager. We asked them how long the wait would be and she told us she's on the phone with COX and they're doing some maintenance and it would be finished in around 10 minutes to an hour. We asked them if they could do any alternative payment method such as Venmo, Paypal or even call the credit card company to do the transaction manually. However they refused to offer any help and asked us to go find an ATM at 12:30 am. We live 20 minutes away from this place and it would take us 40 minutes to go back and forth if we were to go home and get cash so we decided to wait a little and see.  They held our credit cards captive and had us sit at the extremely small waiting area. It was very windy that night and every time someone opened the door a gush of wind would come in and we were freezing. Now that we thought about it the server basically tricked us to leave our table so we would not occupy a table while they sorted things out.   We waited for 30 minutes and it was now 1 am and we had no idea how much longer it would take. We decided to leave one person there and go home to get cash. Soon after we left the parking lot our friend called to tell us that the system was back up and we should come back. When we came back they already finished all the transactions without offering any form of compensation for the inconvenience. They were not one bit apologetic and the manager went home way before the situation was resolved. This is unacceptable customer service to me and I would not recommend this place to any of my friends.",

The steamed egg has been a recent discovery of mine since I've started trying Korean bbq places and I'm so happy Hwaro has it as I always get an order at every place that will serve it. The steak here is the best steak I've had hands down at many of the Korean places I've been too. I always ask for a side of pepper and salt to season it before I grill it.  1 out of the 2 times we were served cold appetizers which I think it was because we were there close to the closing time but my sister went with her boyfriend and raves about how good they were hot! So maybe try to get there earlier than closing times and you can still get their dinner deal which is a steal for AYCE Korean bbq. One last thing the place although small has a really cool atmosphere and deco! Will visit again!",

Now you're probably saying \"Why the F*#! would anyone wait that long?\"...well because one it is so hard to find parking anywhere near China town and two because the hostess said it would may be take an hour or less and three we had kids with us who were restless and four I was told it was a pretty good place for Korean BBQ AYCE.  Any how the restaurant is small with only 8 booths (seats 4 comfortably) and 3 long tables (seats maybe 12 comfortably). There was one other long table but was set up for the people waiting to be seated as well as 3 other booths utilized for the same purpose...so pretty useless and a waste of dining space.  Once seated we were told that the kids would be charged full price at $19.99 (although they only wanted to eat a couple appetizers) so before you come with kids keep in mind kids ages 0-2 free, 3-7 are half price and ages 7 and above full price.  Now the food: the menu selection was good, lotsa variety of meat selection. The side dishes could be better, but you do get a good amount. The Korean KFC is to die for! They're small popcorn like crispy fried chicken with a sweet spicy sauce drizzled on top. The gyoza and egg rolls are just like any other but still pretty tasty.  I give the service a 5 star because the waitress was very attentive as she frequently came to our table changing the grill and taking our orders. The hostess was nice BUT seriously needs to work on her \"timing\", I mean if the place is busy just be honest about the wait time. Other than that, I'd come back...just not on a Friday night.",

We walked out and we said thank you then she frowned and looked us up and down. How can she do that to a pregnant woman?! Rude!  There are more 24hr korean bbq spots near by. Our party of 3 was very disappointed. Old Korean lady sent the bus boy over to take some plates while we were still eating and brought the check too early. Also, they are understaffed. The floor and tables are dirty. The grill burns up too quick. Waiter came 2 times, once at the start and once at the end of the meal.  Never again!",

We will never come back here again...the Korean guy server with a medium built body atleast 5'7 in height is the one with such super terrible attitude so watch out..",

Banchan was fresh, delicious, and abundant (we never had to ask for refills, not even for water since they gave us two small pitchers for our table already)  2. The waiters/waitress were constantly changing our grill (we had 4 grill changes) without us asking 3. AYCE includes the appetizers as well as ice cream for desert (green tea or vanilla)  4.

Service was ok / decent ( the server had 3 tables all at once so I understand ) /// but he noticed my son right away and offered a high chair which is nice. $19.99 for ayce KBBQ, which is a deal, and what we did. Took about 15-20 mins to really get our order in. We first got served our side dishes, and then later our meats for us to grill on our table top. Our burner died a few times, so 3xs we had to flag our server. We eventually got moved to a different table. Overall the food was great, sides and marinated meat. I would like to try again.",

But good luck finding parking in the evening! I love how it's $20 and there's a lot of choices! However, this place lacks seafood. There more of a meat Korean BBQ and there's nothing wrong with that but if you want seafood I wouldn't come here. Their water is on your table so you don't have to badger the waiters asking for water. There's also sauces on the table and they fit well with the meat ! The salad is amazing and I truly love how refreshing it is! I love going here cause I'm more of a meaty gal rather than a seafood gal",

We agreed but passed a table that would have accommodated us easily that was then given to a smaller party in line behind us. So that was a little upsetting but what really got me was the poor service. We had to order some things twice with two different people who always seemed annoyed that we were bothering by ordering. We sat with no drinks for some time and not once did anyone apologize.  We used to take our friends and family here when they are in town but I guess we will look for another place since it seems to be such a bother for them to have people there.  The food is ok, I've had better and had worse but again the service was",

Hint: the potato doesn't need giant chunks of onion, the pickled jalapeno and radish didn't need the onion or sickly sweet taste either, and the pickled onions are very missed. I will say the cucumbers are a welcome addition. The brisket is now consistently extremely fatty and tough, and the service is totally hit or miss. Please change your banchan back.

We also ordered the Pork Belly, Steak, Beef Tongue, Brisket, Baby Octopus (which I didn't eat), Spicy Pineapple Beefsteak, and Short Rib. There were 5 of us and we were stuffed. The sides were your basics, kimchi, pickled radish, fish cake, and pickled onion. It went well with all of the proteins.   The only negative thing that I encountered was the Steamed Egg. It was burnt at the bottom and didn't have much flavor. Other than that, everything was fine.   If you're in the area and craving KBBQ, check this place out. Its pretty good!",

Soo good, too bad they limit the dessert is only one per person.  Although the parking situation might seem bad, we've always been able to find good parking.

I went here with a party of six, as soon as we step inside the ambiance feels authentic. 5 minutes later we realize, it's pretty crammed inside, and there are only 10 tables with grills installed.   So basically, we were waiting for another big party to leave so that we could be accommodated. This is a pretty big negative seems like a hassle for any big party.   When we were sat, we ordered the steamed egg, brisket, beef bulgogi, chicken bulgogi, pineapple spicy beef and I think that's it?? The portions of food they bring out per tray is GREAT! Unlike gen, they really give you a lot of meat everytime you ask for a refill of brisket, bulgogi actually anything.   In addition, to the heaps of meat they bestowed my table with, the quality of the meat is GREAT. Brisket was on point with a good meat to fat ratio. Bulgogi was just right, not to sweet and not too bland. I suggest everyone order the pineapple beef, it was so tender and flavorful.  Hwaro does not have rice paper sorry folks!   At the end of the dinner they give you complimentary ice cream. Get the plum ice cream. The end!   I suggest this place to parties of 4 or less, anything more you might be waiting a while for a table.  Gen and hwaro are both good, I'll be visiting here more often though, as it is closer to my house.   Quick review  Good quality of meat across the board  They make it rain on meat refills  Plum ice cream Fuego  Not enough seating, big parties beware!",

    "text": "When my initial suggestion for a group dinner was rebuffed due to budget concerns, I was more than happy to find that I could make a first-time visit here as our plan B.  Hwaro is the latest incarnation of the all you can eat Korean BBQ restaurant between Raku and Monta. It has changed ownership/branding at least twice now. My group was already seated with banchan on the table when I arrived to join them for the $19.99 per person AYCE dinner. I immediately noticed that the two grills (\"hwaros\") were oddly offset on our long table, and since I was on the opposite side from the grills, I was more than happy to let others handle the ordering and cooking duties.  I didn't take a comprehensive sample of the banchan (side dishes), but I enjoyed the kimchi quite a bit, and there was a seaweed that was pretty appealing. The pickled jalapeno slices are definitely spicy and made me avoid wanting anything with capsaicin for the entirety of the actual meal. The side salad had fresh lettuce and not too much or too little dressing.  I also had a couple of appetizer items (included in the AYCE price). The steam egg indeed spewed out water vapor when it was first brought out, and it was excellent and fluffy. There's just a slight issue in that the crust is clearly burnt, so I had to take care to cut off any parts that were in direct contact with the hot bowl. They also had to order \"the shit,\" which is the same recipe as found in this owner's AYCE sushi places, namely Sakana and Sushi Neko.  I didn't catch the specific meats that they ordered, but we certainly had brisket, pork belly, beef tongue, tripe, and beef short rib. In general, the meats paired well with the salt and pepper oil dip, as well as the sweet and very mildly spicy sauce. The tripe was probably my favorite for the oozing fat, the chewy/crunchy skin, and the marinade, and I was glad that my friend knew how to cook it just right (and ordered me to dip it in just the sweet sauce). The beef tongue had a little more meat flavor than other beef cuts. The pork belly held strong throughout our reorders, and the brisket was fine. We picked up the short rib toward the tail end of the meal, and while it was appealingly marinated, it didn't stand out as much as I'd hoped.  Dessert was one scoop of ice cream, with a limit of one per person. I stuck to tried and True plum ice cream selection, and it was as good here as it's ever been at their sushi restaurants.  Service was good. I don't know if having Korean speakers helped, but they changed out grills often and promptly, and they seemed to respond to all food orders in a timely fashion. I think the size of the raw meat portions varies depending on how many people are in your party.  Out of the numerous AYCE KBBQ places in Las Vegas that I've tried, I'd say Hwaro is my most likely revisit right now. It's a hit in all the key areas of food, service, price, and even ventilation (my shirt doesn't smell of food very much afterward). I'll likely up my rating next time if it's as good or even better.",

For an all you can eat menu I'm super impressed with the quality and flavors of the meat here. The customer service wasn't bad but nothing notable. Nobody is really friendly or talkative. The only negative thing is the small space and waiting space. We came during the lunch hour and it was uncomfortably packed with nowhere to sit or stand. The wait times are long and can make you hangry but the food is totally worth it!",

Not bad for the price either, for $22.95 per person and you can have everything thats on their menu. When I first arrived at the restaurant via Uber, first thing I noticed was the huge crowd of people waiting outside to get in. With that said you know this place is rockin and the food obviously must be off the hook. The wait wasn't too bad. The restaurant has about 11 tables that seat 4 and about 3 huge tables that seat big parties. We tried the following items  Beef Bulgogi (3 orders) Pork Belly (1 order) Squid (1 order) Beef Brisket (2 orders) Prime Rib Steak (1 order p/person) Short Ribs (2 orders) Pickled Daicon is really good Seaweed Salad was good Vanilla Ice cream in coffee, corn flakes and toffee awesome.  Definitely a place to eat when in Las Vegas. Meat quality just as great as Gen's and the ambience of is rocking. Music is uplifting makes you want to get up and dance. Highly recommend this restaurant",

Both of us were craving for K-BBQ. It was my first big meal of the day ( i ate some snacks ), and was my partner 3 meals of the day. Needless to said both of us were starving hippos. There were plenty of parking considering it is in a small plaza.   Our waitress was very attentitive, hence the 1 star. She explains the different choices and pricing. We chose the higher prices for more items selections. Big mistakes, because after 10 minutes of eating... everything was pretty much concluded  to 3 flavors : blend, oily and korean chilly peppers paste.   We ordered 5 dishes: pork belly, skirt steak, beef tongues, octopus and tripes. Neither of us could finish them all. And thank god we didn't otherwise both of us would face an even higher potential serious health issues.   I left the restaurant thinking i would give them a second chance to redeem themselves. But after BOTH of us spending hours running to the toilets and me experiencing excruciating stomach pain for two days. I AM SCARED of this place and will NOT BE coming back!! No $20+ worth of food is going to compensate our health.",

    "text": "How have I missed this AYCE BBQ all this time? I've been to Manta AND Kung Fu Tea! Apparently these glasses aren't working. We came here starving and ready to chow down on some korean food and let me tell you, my stomach was about to go psycho on me. Keeping this in mind, imagine how my stomach felt when the host informed me it would be a minimum of 50 minutes. A MINIMUM. I debated whether or not to head over to my other bbq place, but decided to be miserable and wait it out.   When our name were called I think I was too delusional to comprehend that we were about to actually eat some food. My reaction could be summed up in 2 words....crazy ballistic. You learn not to mess with certain types of women: PMSing ladies, Mad girlfriends, and HANGRY women. Practically ran inside past our host, only to be stopped by the frigging coolest decor I've seen so far. The inside had a feel of an old korean bathhouse, or japanese ramen house. It was so great.   We ordered: The shit, shake shake rice( i suggest ordering if you like the taste of Korean sauces with a dash of seaweed), egg hotpot(could have been better), bulgogi nachos(YES YES), skirt steak, brisket, marinated short rib, green tea pork belly, pork belly with wine, regular pork belly and to finish it off we ordered affrogato. It was crunchy and fabulous!   The service was bombtastic! They were prompt, detailed and wasted no time getting you what you ordered. I was very satisfied with all the staff. Come try it for yourself and you'll see what I'm talking about!",

We then had a guy server he was Amazing. Always had a smile always asking if we wanted something else and he sang Happy Birthday to my sister. The first waitress didn't even ask us if we wanted appetizers which  is included I was a little over whelmed not knowing what to get and she gave us that hurry up face. For 5 people we ended up with an $137 and change bill including 5 can sodas run you $2 each we had water the rest of the meal. We didn't like some of the meat the waitress brought us but we ate it cuz it runs you an extra $9.50 per person if you don't finish your meat. Other than that the place is very clean, nice music I liked the experience not sure if I will go back there.",

Best things about this place:  - their all you can eat menu includes 1 steak per person and it's soooo good.  - their cuts of meat, in general, is really good. The meats don't come to our table frozen to the point that it seems like it's been sitting in the freezer for days like other KBBQ places I've been to.  - their menu selection is huge! They offer a ton of appetizers and side dishes. I love their bean paste soup.  - the atmosphere and the service is phenomenal. I mean sometimes the music can get a little too loud, but I feel like that's just all a part of the experience   Can't say bad things about this place. I pretty much feel like I find myself here weekly.   Oh, and if you write a review and show them, they should be giving you a bottle of beer on the house!",

But when we got there there is a reserved table for another group. The Korean guy said that that reservation was made a long time ago. Really? We felt discriminated upon by this guy. The other younger workers there can't really say or do anything as they said he's the \"boss\". Well Big Boss... one of these days, how you treat others will come back to you!

The place itself gives a comfortable feel since it's not too enclosed and the smell of smoke is unnoticeable. The menu is all-you-can-eat type of menu as it provides a variety of delicious meat and side dishes for you to choose from. Aside from that, they also provide a selection of Soju (In which in my opinion, is the best drink to have when eating the food)         I would recommend ordering Beef Brisket and Enoki Beef, since these were the two best ones that I've tried. I would keep coming back for more. Don't skip on the dipping sauce! It gives the meat even more of a great flavor. If you are a fan of grilling, this is a great place to be since they let you cook your own food.        The service was good since they were friendly and they did their job in a orderly manner. They were diligent when changing the grill for us. Compared to other kbbq resturants that I've been to, Hwaro is the best one.",

The menu is substantial since it includes all sorts of appetizers and side dishes in addition to different types of meats, and it was sufficient for us since we weren't fancy enough to appreciate the several additional meat options that one could get for the more expensive all-day AYCE option. We arrived at our table to find it all set up with some starter banchan, salad, and water, and we were able to start ordering right away. In general, I enjoyed the beef and chicken options a lot, the latter especially since they were well marinated. Pork cheek was also very good, while the pork belly was mostly okay (ours seemed to have less flavor than the others). None of the appetizers really stood out to us--The Shit was just a fried sushi roll, which wasn't anything special. Going back I'd probably focus more on the side dishes to get pickled veggies or spices that complement the grilled meats. Unfortunately we were all too full to try the Shake Shake Rice, but it was awesome that each person got a dessert at the end.  My main complaint was that the service left a lot to be desired. Our people didn't seem to be very interested in taking more orders when we were ready, and it looked like changing the grills was a chore for them. Just try to look past that and focus on the food.",

Mr wife and I ordered all of their 'specialties' like The Shit and the Shake Shake Rice. The shit was good, It's essentially a deep fried California roll. The shake shake is a simple version of bi bim bap. Really good for an ayce like this where you don't really need the full dish. We also got the bean paste soup. Standard and simple, but tasty. The meat was excellent. Cuts were done well and seasoned nicely. We had the short ribs, beef flank, and spicy pork. We are not heavy eaters so we were full after that, though i did want try more. Next time! The only small gripe i had was that the servers work as a team to serve every table and they got some of the orders mixed up, but it's no big deal.",

But if youre into this sort of stuff, by all means, go for it. I personally do not like it, but it doesnt taste as bad as I thought it would.) 4. Sliced Rib Eye (BULGOGI IS ALWAYS THE BEST) 5.

The first time, I came with a group of 8, which I would not recommend anyone to come with a big group because they provide only one grill even for a large party. However, I decided to come with my bf the second time and everything worked out just fine.  Typically at KBBQ, we order a ton of briskets and pork belly because most KBBQ places here don't serve short ribs, so when we saw that they do at Hwaro, we ordered some! We also saw that there were certain items that were limited to 1 order per person, and from reading other reviews, we decided to try to pork shoulder butt. Let me tell you, it was the most tender, melt-in-your-mouth meat I have ever tasted! The quality at Hwaro is one of the best in Vegas for an all-you-can-eat KBBQ. If you want top-notch quality, I would not suggest going to any all-you-can-eat places. I personally enjoyed this place and will continue to visit Hwaro again for my KBBQ craving.",

    "text": "This review is for $19.99 dinner. Also note that my standard for KBBQ in Las Vegas is very low. There just isn't that much competition here yet. Price is pretty good for the quality of meat you get.   SERVICE Service was alright, maybe even mediocre. The employees were all friendly enough as if it was just their job to acknowledge our existence. Just enough. We were left waiting at the front door upon entry though, while this older lady felt that whatever she was doing on the cash register was more important than giving us any attention.  The main gripe I have with the service was that they were sooooo slowww. The place was relatively busy but not packed and they did have a few (3?) servers. It was only once or twice where they would voluntarily come look at us and ask us if we wanted anything. However, most of the time we had to wait or exuberantly flag someone down to refill our salad or get more meat. Maybe the servers are not experienced yet, but experienced servers would definitely notice what is in need of refilling at any table.  FOOD Thank goodness because food is the saving grace of this place. TL;DR meat was good; banchan was ok.  The banchan was not bad at all, especially compared to other KBBQ establishments. We got a large variety (8-9). The egg and potato salad was very ok, as was the kimchi and fish cake. The seaweed with radish tasted old. The standouts for me were the acorn jelly (a first in Vegas!!!), the radish sheets, and the pickeled onion slices.  Sauce Trio - sesame oil with salt and pepper (yummy), red chili (tasted like from the can), and this soy vinegar dip (pretty good). You also get bean paste and jalapeno! Looove. The salad was standard with a light an unobtrusive dressing.  Brownie points for the complimentary bean paste soup and steamed egg. Both were up to par and much better than most places here. I heard they served corn and cheese though. Where was that?!  Pork Belly (Thick) - Standard and yummy. Tripe - Very nice thick cuts Brisket - Standard, came frozen Beef Tongue - Came very frozen, but once thawed and cooked...So delicious and tender! Beef Rib - A little bit chewy but still good Wine marinated Pork Belly - So unexpectedly tender and delicious! My favorite. Pork Shoulder Butt - Fatty and soft. (Looove) Baby Octopus - 1 order per person! It came with 3 pieces. Marinated a little sweet but very delicious.  LOCATION Located in arguably one of the busiest plazas on Spring Mountain, Las Vegas even, makes parking a battle at times. There are just so many popular spots there and so few parking spaces. You can park in adjacent lots, however, for a short and easy walk.  INTERIOR I have to add this section because why the heck is their floor so oily?! Someone's going to slip soon, I know it. Also, it makes no sense that the large tables have two grills only on one side while the other half is left hanging. Wouldn't it make more sense to split two grills evenly? Apparently not. Ventilation is also pretty bad. They also don't oil their grills.  Pro Tip: Take a sheet of radish and wrap it around a piece of cooked pork belly, bean paste, jalapeno, kimchi, and pickled onion. You won't regret it!  CONCLUSION Whew, you know a review is long when there's a conclusion huh? I'll definitely return for the meat alone. Hopefully the service gets better over time.",

Some items are excluded in the lunch special like the Enoki beef which is my favorite and the beef tongue.etc. love their side dishes they serve us, many choices. My favorite is the potato salad. They also have multiple in their menu for pork,beef,seafood, and chicken. Really do suggesting not getting rice but just having rice paper should do the job. I have no complaints with their service , they will always check up on you. Like the dining area with their good choice in music.   This place is great for a big family dining or a group of friends. They never disappoint me at Hwaro bbq always make your money's worth. Just one sad tip that disappoints me is that you need to be in a party of 2 or more. So you can't eat here alone.",

We told our waiter about this alarming surprise in one of the mussels we ordered. However, he said that the pea crab is commonly found in their mussels? My friend and I were very puzzled because we have never seen a pea crab in all of the mussels we have eaten until now. This was the first time Hwaro kind of disappointed us.

It can be a hit or miss sometimes, & if you have a big party (5 or more), the wait can be over an hour especially for dinner. I always try to go for lunch because all I ever order is bulgogi, brisket, extra banchan (kimchi, pickled jalapeno and radish, and fish cake), The Shit, rice paper, steamed rice, and steamed egg. Like I said, everything can be a hit or miss. There are times when the steamed rice tasted like it's a day or two old, steamed egg where it tasted weird, and brisket where it's extra chewy (we grill our brisket to the point of it being crispy btw & never had a problem with it at other KBBQ places).  I've also gone here where we have parties less than 4 people (they charge 15% gratuity for parties 4 or more), & the service is great. But those times I've gone here with parties 4 or more, their service sucked. It's like they don't try hard because they're getting gratuity either way -- which is why I had to knock down two stars. Taking one star away for gratuity of parties 4 or more (shouldn't it be 6 or more?), and taking another star away for crappy service.   I'll hold off on going here for awhile for dinner. I'll probably stick to lunch when I go here where I get better service versus coming here for dinner.",

    "text": "My sis and her family were here for a short visit.  After our day at Hoover Dam we all voted on Korean cuisine.  It was a good opp to introduce my nephew to new flavors.  The decor and larger tables are set up pretty invitingly.  We were led to the sort of upper level seating booth.  Watch your step especially if you've had adult drinks ;)  An observation I made was there aren't as many small plates given here than at other Korean dining locations.  Also their AYCE isn't really all you can eat.  Certain items on their menu are limited to one per person.  That's not the AYCE concept.  They will charge you $3.99 to take anything home.  Why? We aren't wasting it.  You're just gonna toss it which technically costs more money for the business to waste.  Its not like we didn't finish our rice and you charge us for that (like at sushi restaurants).  Twisted...  Service was good not super great.  I'll leave this a neutral, but will definitely bring our Korean appetite cravings elsewhere to other plentiful restaurants here in Vegas.",

There was about a 15 minute wait because of a large table but it wasn't bad at all.  The host was super nice and kept us updated on how much longer it would be. Considering it was about 615 pm I'm surprised we didn't have a longer wait. Our server was Hannah and she was too cute for words. Extremely nice, had great recommendations and checked on us frequently. I also love the decor. It's $22 for all you can eat meats and we tried a ton. My favorites were the mussels and jalapeno beef (I think that's what it was.) My boyfriend liked the skirt steak and the Kim chi cucumbers. We both loved the spicy octopus! I also had the egg rolls which were yummy! Hannah recommended the shit and it was awesome too. Will definitely be back.",

The server from Korea said Korea has better, but this is the best I've ever tried.   Anyway, they're pretty much always busy. I've only been there twice, but both times it was pretty packed. The first time we went we waited about 20-30 minutes to get a table. Luckily, the second time we went I think we only waited about 10-15 minutes.   The meat is awesome. I've been to some AYCE Korean BBQ where the meat was too thin. The meat here is just right. I love that they have beef tongue. My husband loved the brisket. My dad loved the chicken bulgogi.   The banchan is awesome! My faves were definitely the fishcake, but also the potato salad and I think pickled daikon? But yeah... the fishcake!  I liked the taste of their salad thingy too. Really yummy with the meat dipped in sesame oil w/ salt & pepper.  A couple we sat by recommended we try \"The Shit\". It's deep fried something delicious with a dip that's a little spicy but good. You can only get one order per person if that.   At the end of our meal we got the coffee ice cream that the couple recommended to us too. It was AWESOME! It's ice cream with Korean coffee poured over it and cereal sprinkled on the top.   It's only $22.95 and an awesome deal in my opinion. We went to a few different AYCE Korean BBQ places around Vegas and I think this one was the best.",

Just expect to wait is what I am warning any other newbies!  I wanted to just tell our waitress, \"Miss, just bring whatever and keep it coming\" because we hadn't had anything to eat yet that day. We ended up with the sweetest Filipina waitress and she somehow remembered everything we wanted, which was a lot! God bless her. Everything was brought to us quickly. They seriously have efficiency down and work as a team.   I was expecting their short ribs to be marinated, maybe I was supposed to use the sauce in the squeeze bottle? Anyway, it didn't even matter. We inhaled everything...pork belly, short ribs, steak, etc. Quality is well above average. All the employees hustle to serve you pleasantly and quickly. What more can you ask for really for $22, AYCE?  So many things can go awry when a customer is famished and when everything is so perfectly executed, it makes for a great experience!!!! Thank you. We'll def be back.",

If your waiting for some people in your party, you give them your name and number and they text you as your waiting inside. Employees are very nice and are always walking around and asking if everything is okay and if you need anything. And they come and change the grills plate thing as you cook meat it would get dirty. If you go in a party of 5 the total pay plus taxes, plus tip is $30. Really good deal for an all you can eat Korean bbq as you have about 4 or 5 rounds to order. Desert is delicious as they have green tea ice cream and vanilla coffee with corn flakes. They have really cute chalk board drawings.",

    "text": "So not sure after over thousand reviews much more to add but going give it a shot. I have been to few ayce Korean spots around town. Really for the most part I feel not much difference between any of them, The protein selection and the sides see lot of similar menu items. Also there be some things on menu that might not see at other spots around town. The one key thing for me is the quality of the proteins and got have some tongue on the menu. Bias opinion since that my favorite meats comes to Korean Barbeque. The quality of the proteins is another standard that judge me some Korean Barbeque. The amount of side dishes always leaves impression for me. The quality of the protein was very fresh and really good. I came with big group of family visiting from Sac Town. They were ordering the meats for the most part and just taking whatever was on the grill cooking. The sides were solid. I must admit seen few more at other spots but when going ayce it not like you need all the sides. Less room for the good stuff. Lol!   It small place in small location but one that literally mini melting pot of food off the strip. We went at the worst time on friday night so wait time of over 1hr half. I had my doubts being first time. Honest it was worth the patience and the wait. Or do what we did walk next door to Kung Fu Tea for some boba drinks, conversations, and time killer. The parking for that small melting pot suck straight up and no way around it on the weekends or prime dinner hours. If the lot full just find street parking or across the street in front of some church people parking in that lot no problems. The price is actually one of the cheaper ones for ayce style Korean Barbeque. You definitely getting your money worth by the time you leave Hwaro.  The staff was great! We had big party think was 11 in all. So got one of the long middle tables with two burners for our party. It worked out perfect. They were on top of everything from our drinks. Making sure if we were good or needed put more protein orders or sides in. Everyone was friendly. Low ceiling so was surprise but the ventilation system was solid cause with all that cooking going on never felt like getting smoked out the whole time. The MUSIC added another vibe  to the whole evening at Hwaro. It was pretty cool. They got couple wide screens and had music videos of k-pop music I can only assume. It was not soft or so loud you could still have conversations over dinner. Stood out compare to any other Korean Barbeque no doubt. Fan!   The only thing is get mind set that going wait to get seated depending the time of the day. It worth the wait!",

Not only did my hostess serve us, but just about every other employee stopped by at least once to make sure we didn't need to put in any more orders or replace our grill which was swapped out 3 times. Splendid job, guys!  Highly recommend spending the extra $3 for the additional special meats you get to choose from. On a scale from 1-10, we devoured the following: Korean Fried Chicken 7  Spicy Skirt Steak 7 Brisket 8 Green Tea Smoked Pork Belly 10 Sliced Rib Eye x2 (their version of bulgogi) 10 Hanjungsal (pork cheek) 7 Beef Tongue 6 Short Ribs 10  Red Wine Pork Belly 9 Hwaro Premium Steak 3 Enoki Beef 8 Baby Octopus 7 Green Tea Ice Cream 7 Affogato 10  The only piece of meat I was upset about was the biggest and baddest looking Hwaro Premium Steak! I babysat and cooked that beauty to my favorite/perfect temperature of medium rare just to find out it wasn't as premium as they made it sound. On top of that, they only allowed one per table when the menu says per person. We were the first two guests to be seated upon openning and their Shake Shake Rice was not available yet. (fail much?) On a few occasions I also ran into tiny pieces of bone grinding between my teeth during my meat buffet breakdown.  This is the place to be if you enjoy unlimited amounts of protein for a good price. Their restaurant ambiance is very welcoming, spacious, and most of all, clean!  I'll see you guys here soon;)  PS: Jump on the Chum Churum Peach Sake! #delicious",

    "text": "A good AYCE KBBQ in Las Vegas is still hard to find, especially if you're looking for a place with a descent price point--Hwaro has stepped in to fill that void. Hwaro's main attraction is the good (and quality) selection of meats to grill. Our favorites include the beef brisket, pork belly, pork cheeks, beef flank, octopus, inoki beef plus non-grill items like the steamed egg, buttered garlic, and \"The Shit\". The banchan offerings are also plentiful and is kept full by the attentive staff. Price point is affordable between $17.95 (lunch) and $20.95 (dinner). The only drawback is the long, long, wait should you decide you want Korean barbecue during rush hour. Hwaro is also located in a heavily visited food plaza, so parking is just as scarce during busy hours.  Update: Hwaro has listened to the pleas of their patrons and have expanded their seating by converting non-functional long tables with ones ready for grilling. This alone has improved accomodations and wait times.  OLD REVIEW: Hwaro should also really consider updating the wasted tables with working grills to accommodate more patrons.",

    "text": "CONGRATS on ruining our night!!!   ARROGANT, DISGUSTING, DISRESPECTFUL, ABSOLUTE WORST!!!  Feb 25th, the WORST CUSTOMER SERVICE we ever had at HWARO! First of all me and my crew loves this place. Reason why i said crew is because normally when we eat here minimum is 9 people. We usually eat here once or twice a month but never had such a horrible experience.  At the beginning of our dinner, we were already planing our next visit next week. So far everything was great, until we were almost done and asked for our grill to be changed. So before we asked for our grill to be chaged, we ordered 2 hwaro steaks from our ARROGANT and DISRESPECTFUL server named DAN. He wears glasses, tall guy, stay away from him!!! Bad temper and ill-mannered.   So after they replaced the grill, after about 10 minutes of waiting for our steak, I called DAN. I said, \"can you check on our steak because we've been waiting for about 10 minutes and if you look at our grill it's already burnt, yet we still haven't used it because we're waiting for the steak.\" I just asked to remind him about our order because they might have forgotten about it. I was just reminding him, then DAN replied in an elevated voice, \" CALM DOWN OKAY, CALM DOWN! IT'S COMING!\" I was shocked and at the same time i felt very disrespected!   My crew and i had lost our appetite because of how we got treated, specially me. As regulars here we've never encountered such HOSTILITY! As a customer i felt very embarrassed because of how i got treated, also for the people next to our table that heard him and how he reacted when he replied to me.  After he said that, DAN never came back to our table. We were again waiting to order our desserts, IT WASN'T BUSY but DAN never came around! We asked a bus boy to call our server but instead he sends a different server named Maribel if I'm not mistaken.   Before we head out, i went to the front desk, while Dan was there i asked for a MOD (manager-on-duty) but the hostess said there's no one for the night! Surprised because how can a business operate without any shift leader, supervisor, manager or even a GM! No one to advise about our issue! Very FRUSTRATING!  At the end of the night, DAN never showed his face to us, didnt even apologized even though i know he over heard me complaining about him. Because the hostess called him first to hear the complain but he sends someone to talk to me on his lieu.  ABSOLUTELY DISGUSTING to recieve AUTO-GRATUITY! STAY AWAY FROM DAN!   More comments will be posted over social media to make DAN popular! Me and my crew will make you famous.   **** 1 star for absolute worst customer service***",

When we were here the server barely checked up on us though. We got a ton of meat but lots of it just tasted bland. The other place i go to i also remember having more quality and more variety of foods. Maybe I just need to try it again because this was my first experience with KBBQ When I went and that could have been it. Overall though I go to a different location for kbbq",

    "text": "$22.99 ALL DAY, AYCE KOREAN BBQ ALERT! While on the hunt for some decent KBBQ on my recent trip to Vegas, I found Hwaro. This neat little kbbq restaurant located in a little strip mall in Chinatown has my heart. Not only was it affordable, tasty and filling; I didn't leave with a stench of barbequed meat all over my clothes! They have a decent selection but they ran out of skirt steak while I was there :( My server (I forgot his name) was super nice, and explained the whole gist of things. You cook your own food here so it was fun playing chef. My favorite meat on the list was definitely the beef brisket, which I haven't seen much restaurants in NYC offer. They have a time limit of around 2 hours but I was already stuffed 1 hour into my meal. Visiting this restaurant is a must if you're craving kbbq while in Vegas. Oh and the wait time was around 5-10 minutes on a Tuesday night!",

The menu included some of my favorite KBBQ entrees- sliced brisket, pork belly and tongue. The servers are very prompt and switch out your grills as needed. The servers also help manage the food on the grill as needed. I would rate my experience here 4.5. I will say I was not a fan of the spicy pork bulgogi.  A perk is that the establishment is open until 3 am and have a late night menu. Also, located near the strip.",

Unfortunately I have to give 1 star as I have never had to walk in, get seated in 5 min, then sit and wait for almost 10 min for someone to acknowledge me and take my order, especially when it wasn't busy. Stephanie  finally comes over and says hi and I literally got up and I said I changed my mind and walked out. As I'm walking out, Tyler, a supposed Captain,  is just standing behind the counter up front and he gives me a somewhat dirty look and says nothing. As I have said before excellent customer service makes all the difference in the world and both Stephanie and Tyler have no clue what that means as I have had issues with them before with them standing around, not checking to make sure everything is alright, not changing the grill, and just an attitude. So lesson learned do not come here when they are working unless you want a to have a bad experience.",

It's all hype, the quality of the meat is very subpar and tasted very poor. Bulgogi was the only thing palatable. The apps and banchan are forgettable. A lot of the food we're bland which is very unusual for Korean cooking. We've had to ask for sauces, service was ordinary otherwise. Not worth the auto grat.   My daughter was starving and started eating half her rice and fell asleep. I informed our server and she said she was gonna take care of it. Bill comes and she said okay I just charged her half. Wait isn't she only half price anyway since she's 7? Then she says ohhh it doesn't matter if she only ate half of her rice we still have to charge her $12. Okkkkkkkk. I was not about to argue. I should've gone with my instinct and gone to Master Kim's instead. Talk all the smack you want about Gen's but their quality and food is hell of a looooooot better than Hwaro's.

I also asked for sesame oil and salt to dip my meat in. Super yummm!  But like I mentioned, the customer service is class A!

My favorite items were the Shit Ive already tried it in a different restaurant, and have been a fan since than, the nachos were !, and Maybe it sounds ridiculous but the mashed potatoes with the cheese fondue I also liked the brisket the only thing I missed a little salt and pepper from the table because they do have salty oil but I didnt want to add extra fat on my meat.",

The wait staff was definitely friendlier this time around. There's usually a wait but we got lucky and came in on a \"slow\" night and was seated right away. I really like the grill at this place. It cooks the meats pretty fast so less waiting and more eating. Especially since I'm eating for 2 and spent most of the day flying. They do change the grill periodically. The meats and other items is decent for the price. There's about 6 side dishes that you can always refill. There is still a time limit of 1 hour 20 minutes. We finished in about 45-50 minutes. This place is a drive from the strip. About 15 minutes or so depending on traffic. Overall, this place is a bang for your buck. If you're trying to eat good and get full without spending a fortune, this is the place!",

But that's a bold statement; why would I say that we'll let's start. We came in Monday around 5 the parking lot was packed so understandable, the restaurant was kinda busy but not due to customers but the fact that they only had 2 servers taking care of the whole restaurant so it's safe to say bad service. Next was the food, we got an order of beef tongue; brisket and short ribs... probally some of the worst cuts of meat I've ever had, the tongue had the consistency of a rubber band and tasted like it too, the brisket was also very chewy and had a flavor of freezer burn and last the short ribs which ever way I tried to cook it rare, medium rare still chewy and very hard to swollow! The atmosphere of this place is nice, open space nice decor. Overall I'll wait the 1 and a half to eat at my favorite kbbq next time so much for trying new places",

I brought my family here for lunch, we were greeted and seated awkwardly as if we were not welcome here. As soon as we sat down i noticed the grill was dirty and asked for a replacement then the server rudely changed the grill. She was so mad about changing the grill she almost hit me on my face with the clean one on her other hand. She was not paying attention at all. After that, I asked about the menu because it was our first time here. the server who was helping us was very rude and inpatient i believe her name is KU. She seem also mad that I asked about the menu and started raising her voice and kept repeating herself \"do you get it?\" And did not even let me speak. I do not tolerate any kind of this attitude at all especially when my son is around. My family did not deserve that kind of treatment when we were very kind and patient giving them the benefit of the doubt after the encounter we had with replacing the grill. All my other family member comes here often and this is the only reason I found out about this place. It's unfortunate that we didn't even get to try the place out all due because of a server who obviously hate her job.",

The waitress spilled sauce all over my boyfriends shorts and the place was extremely hot ! I understand it's summer time but they need to turn the air up or something because me and my whole group were sweating. So most of the dinner we were uncomfortable from how hot it was and the fact my boyfriends short are now ruined. The waitress did apologize for ruining his shorts but didn't even offer some sort of discount ? I understand it was an accident but now he has to buy new shorts. They also charge 15% gratuity for groups of 4 ?!? I've never heard of that. Needless to say we won't be back.",

    "text": "Read a lot of great reviews and decided to come here. It was a Sunday around dinner time when I came in with my boyfriend. The hostess said there was going to be a wait of about 40 mins so we left our information and roamed the plaza.   It actually only took 20 mins until I received a text saying they were ready for us which was great! We were then sat down. Everything we needed was already at the table which included the menu, utensils, water, and side dishes. There was no drink menu however. You probably have to ask for it.  We ordered corn cheese, bean paste soup, skirt steak, brisket, beef tongue, the green mussel, the hwaro premium steak, and the enoki beef for our first round. On our second round we ordered gyoza, kfc, and \"the shit\". And for dessert we both had green tea ice cream.   For the things I enjoyed: The enoki beef was great! The skirt steak was great! I HIGHLY recommend as it was one of the only things I thoroughly enjoyed. The green mussels were pretty good too. I think people who like spicy foods would like it along with their bean paste soup!  The corn cheese wasn't great. It had an overwhelming sourish taste. I'm not sure how to describe it- kinda sour, kinda tangy. I've had corn cheese from other places which do have a little bit of that taste with their corn cheese but this one was just overwhelming, I took one bite and left it.  The brisket was average. It was cut thicker than I was used to. Maybe its just the way it is around here but in Boston it's usually pretty thin. The beef tongue was also just average along with their gyoza.   The hwaro premium steak was super bland. I figured they'd put salt and pepper or something but they didn't. We ordered garlic butter for it to try to help with the flavors. The garlic butter was alright and didn't help much.  Kfc was alright, it was kinda dry and was better off without the sauce.  \"The shit\" which I was pretty excited for after reading all the reviews was okay. My boyfriend enjoyed it tho!  Lastly, the green tea ice cream didn't really taste like green tea. It lacked green tea flavor somehow.   Overall, the service was really great though. Our server was very nice and smiley throughout our meal and checked up on us several times. She also informed us there was a time limit! So just keep that in mind!",

The standouts were the baby octopus and the fourth item, which I actually don't recall exactly what it was (I asked for something good in a small portion). I wasn't particularly impressed with the Hwaro steak, and the mushroom and beef wasn't memorable. Overall I would say the quality isn't up to Hobak, but that it can still be a worthwhile experience.  I'm rounding up because my server (Janice) was particularly helpful.",

We're definitely glad we came to eat here!  The food was great.  The meat tasted high quality. The soybean paste was so good I could just eat that by itself.  The steamed egg was nice and the sides were great.    The environment was very aesthetically pleasing.  It's a small restaurant but it was decorated beautifully.  It's really busy but because it's so small it's not hard to get service and everything comes out quickly.    The service--however-- was the BEST part of the entire experience.  Our server Tyler was always making sure our orders and requests were completely quickly but also explained the menu to us in the beginning.  He was checking on us often to make sure we were satisfied with our dinner.   He was really nice and even recommended food and drinks to us (Jinro Isul Tok Tok Peach drink is amazing).  He was really kind and honestly, that alone made us love the restaurant more than other places we've been here in Vegas.     This isn't our last trip to Vegas so this definitely won't be our last trip to Hwaro.  It's amazing, please eat here!  Also tell Tyler (even if he isn't serving you) that he's doing amazing. :-)",

    "text": "Plus: it's in the same plaza as curry zen- for the best Japanese curry- bold statement I know! And monta ramen- amazing garlic oil ramen!!!!   Parking: it has a private lot but it gets full at peak meal times ! Saturday... we came at 10pm (they close at 3am) and opted for the AYCE bc that's what they're known for. It's a minimum of two people for AYCE FYI. $19.99   The meats we got:   Bulgogi  Brisket Beef belly with jalapeno garlic  Green tea pork belly   My faves: bulgogi and beef belly. BEEF BELLY WAS MY ABSOLUTE FAVE AND WILL BE BACK FOR IT. It melts in your mouth and isn't as thick as the pork belly.  Public health tip: ask for an extra tong for your cooked meats ; and use the one they give you for your raw meats.   Other things we got: shaken rice and bean paste soup (tip cook some of the Brisket and add it to the soup then you got some soon tofu soup / Sundubu-jjigae!) the shake shake rice was good but be prepared bc it's sweeet. I ate it with my meat and of course topped every bite with some kimchi and fish cakes.   Their banchan: are delish! I am picky about my kimchi but theirs tastes fresh and yummmy.  In Vegas- this is the best I've had so far.",

    "text": "I\"m reviewing from the perspective of AYCE during lunch time, as these are the only times I've been through the years..and they're A-OK in my book...here we go..  Hwaro service:  I've never waited more than 10 minutes during the lunch visits and the party size is usually 5-7.  Most likely it's because they open at 11:30 AM, but the place fills up quickly.  We've always told them we were on a lunch break and the servers have always been on point with taking care of us quickly.  Grill changes, banchan replenishes and drink refuels are always coming.  Hwaro KBBQ: The $19.95 lunch special meat offerings are more than adequate to get our KBBQ fix on a work day.  The Brisket, Bulgogi, Rib eye and the Pork Belly are all good quality for the price you pay for.  The banchan dishes here that are consistently good for me is: kimchi, fish cake, radish and potato salad.  Their salad is always fresh and tasty here.    Overall, you're getting pretty good value for the price you're paying.  Hwaro Ambiance: Kpop music is playing in the background and the whole dining area is mainly comprised of wood: seats, benches, booths, etc.  You could convert this place into an Izakaya restaurant and barely have to change any decor.  In the middle the restaurant is a leafless tree with random bottles hanging like Christmas ornaments, great social media pic.    Hwaro is located in a plaza which is a hot spot to many trendy Asian restaurants which can make parking a challenge quickly.  If there is a long wait, there are many other KBBQ options in the vicinity.  If you don't have a long wait, Hwaro is a good value based AYCE Korean BBQ stop with great neighboring dessert places.  These are the cards you're dealt with Hwaro, play them as you see fit.  Enjoy!",

Banchan isn't even good either. Really disappointed & makes me not want to eat kbbq ever again. I HIGHLY suggest Master Kim's if u want ur kbbq fix and for QUALITY meat.   Also, they don't even have soondubu as a side. And why do I have to wait 30 minutes later for my corn cheese to melt!! I'm trying to eat it ASAP lol anyone who gives this place 5 stars clearly hasn't tried other kbbq spots around Vegas. Over hype af",

    "text": "Let's start 2017 off right!  With a 5 star review!!  Starring HWARO Korean BBQ!!  I've had my share of Korean BBQ around town and besides the stank of smoke and grease on your clothes afterwards, it truly is a fun experience.  It's like cooking by a campfire, for non-outdoors hipsters...HA!  I gotta say though for AYCE, Hwaro is right now my fave place to go!  Our 1st visit there, if I had to take away any stars, it was for the wait.  On a weekday for lunch, we still waited like 30 minutes for a table!  It was that busy, plus everyone already sucking up their grilled meats were taking their sweet time.  No matter, I'd be doing the same!  Once we got seated though, the grinds came FAST & FURIOUS (not starring Vin Diesel)!  Our table was already set with all necessary banchan:  -Rice Paper (Yes!  Only AYCE in town that offers it!  I love it!) -Green Leaf Salad -Pickled Radish -Pickled Onion -Kimchi (of course I asked for more) -Potato Salad -Fish Cake -Jalapeno & Garlic -Green Onion Salad (man I love onions too)  Cut the cue to the BBQ grill and away we go!  They got ONE menu.  It's got everything you need.  Either pick the Lunch menu for $17.95 per person (over 45 items) or the All Day Special menu for $20.95 per person (over 52 items).  With either menu you can't go wrong!  We chose the lunch menu not only because it was good value but because there were so many other things we wanted to try!    **From the All Day Special menu we didn't get to try the Short Ribs, Beef Tongue, Hwaro Premium Steak, Baby Octopus, and a few other dishes.  Its OK, we can next time!**  Normally we would complain if we didn't get Short Ribs but fortunately our experience was tasty.  Super tasty!  We sampled damn near everything else on the menu:  -Skirt Steak -Beef Belly -Brisket -Green Tea Smoked Pork Belly -Sliced Rib Eye -Beef Flank -Tripe -Hanjungsal (Pork Cheek) -Chicken Bulgogi  How did we do this?  For some items we got a half order, just so we could try it!  Then we order more of the meats we like the most.  We didn't stop there, oh no folks.  We took part in Hwaro's appetizers too:  -Gyoza -KFC (Korean Fried Chicken) -The $hit (kinda like a fried sushi roll) -Steamed Egg (one per table) -Shake Shake Rice (one per table - kind of like a bibimbap)  OH, and don't forget to ask for bowls of RICE!  Extra banchan too.  The meat quality here is very good!  Not funny smelling or slimy at all.  So hopefully the meat is of the fresher variety.  All tasted great too, especially wrapped in rice paper!.  That pork cheek was a surprise, delicious with onions & garlic cooking along with it on the grill!  The appetizers were pretty good too.  I love my steamed egg and the Shake Shake Rice was a nice detour from our carnivore mode.  After stuffing ourselves silly with meat upon meat upon meat upon banchan, we settled for Hwaro's 2 tiny choices for dessert (one per person):  -Green Tea Ice Cream -Affogato (vanilla ice cream with Korean coffee)  Believe me you don't need dessert after eating here, but the Affogato was a nice little palette cleanser to end the meal.  Some strong @$$ coffee!  Green tea ice cream wasn't bad either but I'm fairly sure it's store bought LOL.  Hwaro is a nice joint too, very much for the young crowd with K-Pop music TV blaring in the background.  I love me some Girls Generation while dining on some K-BBQ!  You bet your sweet soju I'll be back!!  #betyourbottomdollarthatHWARO",

We arrived near 11pm and this place was packed! The wait was nearly 45 minutes but hey there is another restaurant next door to get some adult beverages while waiting which we did lol. Once we were seated, we all wanted the all you can eat option for $21 per person - we ordered the red wine pork belly, brisket with Enoki mushrooms, shaken rice in a traditional Korean lunchbox, brisket, spicy pineapple beef steak, corn cheese, KFC (Korean fried chicken), regular pork belly, the spicy skirt steak, and more!   Definitely can't go wrong with any of there meat selections and loved how there was 52 items to order from the all you can eat menu. Love this place!   You can select from a late night special with 45 items for $18 instead of $21 - but why skimp over $3? Seriously.",

    "text": "I was having dinner with three of my co-interns, and in deciding which Korean barbecue place to go to, we opted for Hwaro because of its competitive price and menu options.   I arrived first to put my name down, and it was about a thirty minute wait at 5:40PM on a Friday. There were a few tables that were not being used, so I was a little confused, but the restaurant was full with many more parties waiting by the time we left.  Service was fine, but it could occasionally be hard to flag down your particular server. There is a 90-minute time limit for your meal. They were good about regularly changing the grill.   There were a few banchan dishes, nothing particularly special. There is an \"all day special\" menu/price, which basically is a dinner menu/price. The lunch and late-night prices are for those specified time periods, and the lunch menu excludes the \"all day special\" premium items.  Overall, the food was not bad, especially for the price ($20.95 + tax). I didn't get to try any pork dishes on this visit since one of my dining companions was Jewish. We were definitely stuffed and satisfied by the end of the meal. I've definitely had better Korean barbecue elsewhere, but this is pretty decent for Vegas.  The interior is casual and the atmosphere is lively, complete with the expected barbecue grill smoke and noise. The restaurant is not all that big though, so just be prepared for a wait during peak dining hours.  P.S. Sorry for the paucity of photos, I was hungry/busy. I will try to add an exterior photo when I am back in that plaza. Oh, and for those that know this plaza, parking is always tough, so just be aware!",

    "text": "Wow - this was a fantastic first experience! I had never tried Korean BBQ before tonight (mainly because there isn't one in the town that I live in) and I've been intrigued for a while. So, when I decided to do an extended weekend in Vegas, I just had to try one. I did good picking Hwaro! Another first, I've never left a review before either because that's just not my deal, but totally broke my own rule to leave this one because it was JUST SO GOOD! My favorites were the short rib and beef bulgogi (any meat that was marinated was ridiculously good). Tried a few appetizers too, which were yummy. But the best part of it all was our server, Peter. He was super attentive and welcoming. Every time he left our table, he said thank you. To us! I was like, thank you! Because he was so great! And to top it all off, it was a very reasonable price: $52 after taxes for the both of us - what a deal! I don't know if I am ever coming back to Vegas, but if I ever make it here again, this will definitely be a required stop! In the meantime, I'm telling everyone I know they need to try this place the next time they're in town!",

    "text": "Yelp led us to this Korean Barbecue gem in Vegas.  We waited an hour to get seated because of the queue.  It was busy!  Very impressed with the service.  We never had to ask for anything.  Grill changes, drink refills, more meat, etc.. As busy as the place was, we never had to call for help.  I have been to many All-You-Can-Eat Korean Barbecue restaurants but this one has gone to the top of my list!  The quality of meat being served for table top grilling was outstanding.  We had the premium Hwaro Steak (oh so good!), the Green Tea smoked Pork Belly (loved it!), the Signature Pork Cheek (wonderful flavor!), Pork Belly (yum!), Enoki Beef (a must-try!), and Beef Tongue (yum!).  Their sides were just as impressive!  The Hwaro Spicy Rice is a must. It's rice with fresh, pickled, and spicy ingredients, topped with a sunny side up egg.  Mix it together and it is the best complement to the delicious grilled meats.  Also enjoyed the \"Shit.\"  Yes, that's what it's called!  It is an open faced stuffed jalapeno pepper fried in light batter that comes with a really good dip. To cap the meal was a choice of ice-cream: Afogato or Green Tea.  We ordered both.  The Afogato Ice Cream was a delightful surprise: vanilla ice cream with espresso coffee and cereal crisps.  Overall dining experience was amazing!  Will definitely be back!",

I had the brisket, pork belly and bulgogi. I could not sleep the same night from going back and fourth to the bathroom all throughout the night.   Man, I don't know what kind of meat they use; I can definately tell they are NOT using the fresh ones. I, as Korean, am a pro when it comes to Korean food including KBBQ. It was my like third time and was never a fan. I also got distracted by loud atmosphere and servers sometimes forget our orders as well. I regret wasting my times on fining a parking spot, waiting in line for 2 hours. Will not definately go back and will go elsewhere.",

    "text": "When I tell you I'm a Korean bbq addict I mean what I say. This is like the fifth I've tried in Vegas and it's ok but it's not my favorite. My favorite is in Hawaii but that's another story. I've been wanting to try this place for a while but every time we've come the place is packed. We decided to wait it out this time and wait time was shorter than expected. They have a few tables that don't have grills on them so I believe if they put the hood vent over them and converted the tables they could make more money and cut down on wait times but that's none of my business.   There's a pros and cons to this place just like other KBBQ places I've had in Vegas. Pros are the price and service. Cons are the wait time and quality of meat. The price is a steal at 16.99 compared to some other places that are $30 or more depending on where you go but for those prices the quality is superb. The service we had here is was actually quite good. We were checked on quite a bit during our meal and rarely had to flag down a waiter. The concept of having your own water pitcher saves a lot of issues in my opinion and is pretty genius but the fact that the table space and wall being so close behind you can make some people pretty uncomfortable. Believe me I seen some people turn their table to the side having no room to move.  Ok I've explained some of the pros and cons I'll talk about the food. Banchan is ok. The kimchee is my favorite it's always my favorite with KBBQ. Theirs is packed with flavor they didn't not skimp on the marinade.The pickled cucumbers and bean sprouts follow behind leaving the other few banchan dishes we were served. The salad here is delicious like when I tell you I ate the whole bowl by myself I'm not joking. I like that they serve sauces with the meat in a big enough dish that you don't really have to ask more. Unless you're me and you dip everything in the sesame oil with S&P that's the only one I use because it's all you need IMO. They have a pretty good assortment of meats but my favorite  was the ribeye and brisket. Pork was pretty good too and the chicken I was surprised at because I thought it would be dry. Take my advice and get the meats unmarinated if you like to dip so you're not salt bombed as my friend Antonia says.   I know Tofu Hut has a bad wrap but I still prefer them over this place price wise. For quality DJK is my top fav. If the hype dies down I may give them another shot but to me they're just alright.",

They offer a pretty decent sized variety of meat and seafood for $19.99/person. It included everything from your typical short ribs, pork belly, rib eye, and brisket. It also included squid, octopus, green tea pork belly, spicy pork shoulder, beef tongue, and more!   The meat was tasty, portions weren't too huge but I appreciated that especially at the end when I was getting stuffed! Meals came with some yummy steamed egg and kimchi soup.   Service was very good! They were kind, friendly, attentive, and got the meats out in a timely manner. I will definitely be coming back here to get kbbq!  Environment: 4/5 Food: 4/5 Price: 4/5 Service: 5/5",

    "text": "We came for lunch and the guys were hungry so we upgraded to the dinner menu which was $20. Our group got split up into 2 separate tables because each table only had one grill. (Even for 6-8 seaters.) We were here for the food, so no big deal.  (For large parties, this might not be the best place for get togethers.)  It seems like a small family shop and they did everything themselves. The service was slow...which was understandable since there was only one server for the entire restaurant. There was probably a total of 4 workers. The menu isn't too long so you will get a chance to try them all. It was a bit hard ordering with our server because she doesn't write the orders down. So not all our orders got through the first time around. The portions were small... so I highly suggest to order ahead or prepare to wait. We were starving!   Premium orders are one per person. The skipped out on a lot of our orders that were suppose to be complimentary for dinner cost (Not clearly mentioned on the menu.) The menu says dessert was included and when we asked.. our server said \"not today\". Okay... so no dessert.   Since our table got split into 2 groups with 2 separate bills we still got charged for 18% gratuity. Hard to justify ... (*Feeling MEH)  We really tried to enjoy our meal, only there were so many small things that bothered us. I can't help but knock out a few stars for this place. Its a hit or miss... Its not the best place to go for kbbq in vegas but the meat quality was still good for the price.",

They have a menu item called \"the shit\"... it was aiight.  Now it comes down to service. After the waitress took our first order, the server was able to get our food quickly. As we finished our first round, our grill was pretty caked with the burned marinade. The waitress came by and replaced the grill and took our second round order. This is when it kind of went downhill. Water carafe was removed, but never refilled. 15 minutes go by and we still don't have the second order, so the server comes by and asks if we wanted to order more. I told her we already did, so she goes back and checks on other tables. 5 minutes go by and she comes back and takes the order. We also ask for water along with our order.  She delivers our second round pretty quickly because she knew we were waiting, but then misses the water.   Overall a 4 star because the value and quality weighed higher than the service that we experienced. Almost rated a 3.",

    "text": "Hwaro is the new kid in one busiest plazas in Chinatown (home to Curry Zen, Raku, etc).   I came with a group of 9 on a Saturday night; there wasn't a table big enough for our party so we split into 2 groups.  It wasn't terribly busy inside, but right from the get-go, service was very spotty.  15 minutes into being seated, our friends who are seated across from us have gotten their drinks and  have started grilling their food while we are still waiting for our server to attend to us.  When our server finally arrived, most of our party was already annoyed and envious of our other companions.  We asked if we could get started right away, but our waitress said she couldn't take our order until she put the grill on (why she couldn't take our order and then put the grill on is beyond me...)  We waited for probably another 5 minutes, but by that time it seemed like an eternity before we were able to order.    We were able to try the pork belly, beef tongue, brisket, wine marinated pork belly, and the one per person dinner items such as baby octopus and enoki beef.  The meat was all very good!  I liked that they weren't overly marinated and I liked that they gave you 2 extra dipping sauces (one is sweet and the other is spicy) along with the traditional sauce of sesame oil with salt and pepper used for pork belly.  We also got a lot of banchan which included kimchi, fishcake, broccoli with a white sauce on top, small fish, apple/egg salad, mussels, corn cheese, and pickled radish.  They also served complimentary bean paste stew, steamed egg, and salad.    Although the food was really good, our server rarely came back to check on us.  And when she did, she never came back with the salad we asked for.  We had to wave down our friend's to ask if their server can help refill our drinks and put in another order.  And as another yelper mentioned, I don't think they change the grills after it becomes charred and nasty.  When it initially started to get black, we wiped the char off with some of the pickled radish so we could continue cooking.  When we were ready for our second order, we asked to change the grill and instead they wiped the grill with a napkin.  At the end of the night we were all full, but with such lackluster service, it's hard to say that I thoroughly enjoyed my meal.",

My mom, her husband and my brother never had Yakiniku before and this was a fantastic restaurant to take them to.   Everything on the menu was on the board with 1 hour. My family loves gyoza so we ordered so many rounds of gyoza it was crazy. The staff is super friendly and it was really enjoyable.   I highly recommend!",

Plenty of servers and employees saw us, but not one of them acknowledged us. It wasn't very busy. Just when we were about to inquire, two people walked in behind us, went over to the register and signed their name on a clipboard and were immediately sat. I asked the lady if we needed to sign in because we had been waiting, and she said yeah and walked away. I then walked out the door. Customer service was the worst I have ever experienced.

They should have notified everybody that were waiting to be seated about this. Of course 3omins wait time for rice was stretched to an hour. Very bad customer service. Refills came very slow to Never. The waiter even gave us empty wet plastic cups for our water. Gross. Not coming back ever.",

No rude servers and every time you order something new it's brought out right away and they change your grill out with a clean one.  So far this Hwaro will be our go to Korean BBQ.

So, me and my friend decided to do this thing and count how many times the servers would come up and ask if everything was okay. I swear, they kept coming back every minute. We gave up counting. Long story short, we weren't done eating yet and they kept bugging us. They already handed us our checks which we didn't ask for it. I wanted dessert but they forced us to leave. We got upset and went somewhere else for dessert. For my first experience here I would say I'm disappointed. If you want to be checked up on every minute and forced to leave this is the perfect place! Sorry, I'm not returning.",

Serving it in a very, VERY small bowl makes one have to repeatedly ask the wait staff to bring out more.  Could never find the wait staff when I ran low on rice or drinks.

There's a good variety of different traditional Korean dishes and appetizers on this menu. It gives you options for sauces and sides also.   I just love the Korean red bean dip and they make a great version. We tried almost everything in the menu (but, be careful, it says that if you over order that you will be charged a la carte prices.) Alright I had no problem finishing everything because it was so good and rich in flavor. My taste buds were going wild with the strong and hearty taste that they have in each of the dishes.   There's a dish called \"The Shit\" and it is...'the shit'! It's got a great side sauce to go with it and just like the menu suggests, it is a \"must try.\" The other \"must try\" was a rice shaker and it's basically a bibimbap. It was great but not what I'm used to bibimbap being because it was in a different container and was loose but the ingredients were the same. So it's like bibimbap but a 'shaker' because it was shaken up in the container.  Everything was really worth trying at least once and some items I ordered twice.   I've never been to Korea but I've been to k-town and I instantly felt like I was there after walking inside. Great ambiance and comfortable seats.   I would recommend to a friend for sure",

    "text": "So, this place is pretty amazing. I can see why the waitlist fills up fast. COME EARLY for dinner if you want a seat fast, especially for big groups.   All the meat tasted fresh and they were quick to deliver those orders. Maybe it's cause we ordered too much at once and also because I've just started eating red meat again, but I couldn't distinguish the meat orders from each other unless it was pork vs beef vs octopus. Aside from that, they change your grill fairly often and you could request for them to do it if they happen to not see you. Dessert is also available, though it was just ice cream options.  Some personal gripes would be that they don't offer the large lettuce leaves, though they do have salad. I'm not sure how much soju is regularly at restaurants, but at 11 dollars a bottle, I do see my money quickly disappearing if I'm drinking with friends. But aside from that, not many real complaints.  The price is pretty fantastic for AYCE korean bbq, even with alcohol prices not being so agreeable. They have a large array of food options for the all day special. It's a popular establishment, so come early and bring friends!  kamsahamnida, hwaro!",

Cooked items like KFC was crispy good; The Shit was just okay, fishy n not that interesting.   I liked that they portioned the orders smaller so we could try more without getting too full. TIP: order thin meats like beef brisket and tongue first so you could get to eating fast.  We had such a wonderful time. Left w happy bellies.",

There is usually always a wait if you go during lunch time or dinner time.   It is definitely one of the cheapest AYCE Korean BBQ place, a good selection of side dishes and a goof variety of meat, however, the service is pretty terrible.   The first time I was there I was celebrating a friend's birthday, toward the end while we were eating our ice cream we were asked by our waitress to leave because they have people waiting for tables... really? Honestly, it is not like we were sitting there for a long while, I literally just put my spoon down and the waitress ran over and asked us to leave. I get it, the place is small and they have very few tables, but I don't think guests should ever be asked to leave before they are ready.   The second time I came with my family, there were 6 of us. As we were ordering the meats, we probably ordered 5 different meats, the server looked at us and asked \"Can you finish all this?!\" - I understand that they are trying not to waste products, but for 6 people ordering 5 meats... and we eat A LOT...he could have asked in a more polite manner. And the entire time we had to flag down our server for more side dishes, he kept going to other tables except for ours.   The third time I was there, there were 3 of us. We ate everything and everything was fine until we wanted to pay. We had 1 plate of steak with 2 slices left over, the owner walked over, eyed our table and said \"Next time I will charge!\" - we simply said Ok but we honestly did not like the way the meat was marinated so we did not eat it. We literally ate everything on the table except for that meat and she gave us attitude.   I really like the price and the food, but after being there 3 times and getting annoyed all 3 times, I will most likely not come back.",

    "text": "This is my favorite all you can eat buffet meat buffet mainly because it has the large intestine option. They have two different prices for lunch and dinner and I believe the lunch price is also an option for the late night pricing as well. All drinks and appetizers are included and they have a pretty extensive menu which you can check under the pictures and of this yelp website.  It's fairly busy especially on the weekend especially dinner time so if you do come in a group of more than four prepared to wait at least an hour or so and you can't make reservations I believe. Usually a wait time for four and under about 30 minutes or so but I believe they have some kind of snow cafe where you can wait if you want to. Also another tip make sure you write your name instead of just telling the hostess because sometimes they forget to write your name.  When you do order make sure you order quite a bit because the amount they give you is pretty small and by time you're done it can take a while to flag them down and they said you have a time limit but I've never had anyone actually kick us out. Some of the appetizers are similar if you've been to their sushi location (sushi neko) which is across the street.  Overall if we have out of town guests and they want to eat at all you can eat buffet we will take them here. Oh another tip it's really hot in here so don't bring any thick clothing because trust me you will be sweating and not able to eat a lot.",

Good prices (especially the lunch special at $16.99) and feels and tastes much more authentic (unlike Gen). Price includes dessert.  Lots and lots of banchan (side dishes) given. Includes pickled onion, peppers, kimchi, odeng (fish cakes), bean sprouts, radish, and seaweed. Just wish there was macaroni salad.  Appetizer menu is quite large and delicious. Be sure to order the corn cheese and garlic butter to eat with your meats. KFC (Korean Fried Chicken) is a crunchy break from the monotony of soft beef and pork. Large meat menu as well, and portions are plenty.  Service is excellent. They come to check on you more than enough times, even during busy lunch hours.   **if the parking lot is full, I usually just park at the church next to the plaza and walk over**",

    "text": "I came here late November during lunch hour. For those of you who don't know how Korean BBQ works, there is a fire pit grill in the middle of your table and you cook the raw meats you order yourself on the fire pit. The simplicity of the menu makes it easy to choose what to get; options range from pork, chicken, and beef cuts of meat to seafood and vegetables at Hwaro. There are also a la carte options you can order, all of which are included in the All-you-can-eat deal (some  items might be limited, however).  My party of four all had the All-you-can-eat Lunch Speacial. We had a taste of about half of the meats on the menu. We had two types of chicken, octopus, brisket, \"the Shit\" (Yes, that's what it's called), and another type of beef. All were delicious and tasted as expected.  We also had dessert. Green tea ice cream was our selection and it was vibrant with the taste of matcha; a must!  The waiter was quick to change our fire pit whenever it got too black, which happened about three times. One thing I did not necessarily enjoy would be the rate at which our dishes were cleared. I get that some places wait until the meal is over to clear the dishes, but with four people at a table, with our place settings fitting tightly, clearing our dishes more often would have things more comfortable for us. It was also inconvenient to have to pour our own water from a water bottle; with four people, the water goes fast and having to constantly ask for more water becomes a chore. In addition to this, not having a staple of rice from the beginning was a little disappointing. How can you eat Asian food without rice? We were able to order rice, but it should have been a clear option from the start.  All-you-can-eat lunch and dinner are reasonably priced. However, whenever I hear \"All you can eat\", the impression I get would be to eat food as much as possible until I have been satisfied with what I have consumed. During my visit, I felt as if they waiters did not want us to order after the second round of ordering meats. The brisket and chicken are pretty light and sharing the portions of meat with your party makes each order go fast.  I would not mind coming back here if invited, but I did not feel as if I got my money's worth. Korean BBQ is great, but make sure you get the value of your dining experience as advertised.",

Their appetizers were really good and they often changed the grills. My party of 8 was seated in 15 min or less but then again, we were the first costumers. I like how they also serve you a choice of dessert at the end unlike other AYCE Kbbq .   Try the padak & egg (super fluffy) .  4 stars because it was hot in there",

We went next door which is Hwaro and decided to do ayce korean bbq instead. They asked me to sign and write how many party.   It is a small korean joint, seems like it can seat about 50? We were the only one who's on the wait list. We waited about 15mins or so. We were seated and ban chan was already served on the table. Everything was fine, from kim chi to mashed potatoes but fish cakes (which is my favorite!!) and bean sprouts were a little too salty!!! Eeeek!  The meats were good and perfectly marinated! Squid is good too!   Service is friendly! No complaints. Although our order of rice took a little longer to be served since the waitress forgot about it. So when she passed our table again, i asked for the rice, and she was like \"oh yes!\" But thats ok. They were busy and sometimes that happens! :)  Overall experience was good!

Hwaro has quickly become my favorite KBBQ place in Las Vegas and I would even go as far as to say it's the best AYCE.  I usually do the 'All Day' special, which includes the full menu and that comes out to $22. But for I think $2 less you can do the lunch special If you're on a budget (Don't quote me on the price of the lunch special) To me, the price is completely worth it as the have a WIDE variety of meats unlike other KBBQ's in the area. They also include appetizers and desserts in their AYCE which is a total plus!  My favorite meats are the brisket, skirt steak, short rib, and beef tongue. I love dipping them in the sesame oil and cheese fondue. YOU HAVE TO GET THE CHEESE FONDUE. When I was first introduced to dipping bbq in cheese I was a little skeptical but after trying it, I can't imagine kbbq without cheese.  The only con of Hwaro, is the wait.. Which you're pretty much going to get at any AYCE Korean BBQ. But I would say if you didn't want to wait come before 6.  Customer service has really improved since the first time I went, maybe they were just having an off day, but every time I've come since then it's been excellent!",

You cook your own meat here. Good variety of meats and appetizers if it's a first visit. If you love sweet anything, go for the bulgogi nachos! And maybe some soju. My favorite was the jalapeno garlic pork belly   The service was great, always replacing the grill.  Parking in this plaza, we all know is a pain, so good luck. If the wait time for another place is ridiculous, might come back here to try other things.",
