I ordered a teriyaki bowl with chicken and it just tasted really bad. I had asked for no rice so instead I got a very messy black bean soupy salad. The whole combo was just odd to say the least.   I think I would have preferred the beans on the side and I'm surprised that they did not pay attention to this small, but important detail. My whole dish became soggy and was not appetizing at all.  I think next time I'll order some tacos and not subtract anything and hopefully that'll be a better option. I will say that I did try their chips and salsa and those are pretty darn tasty.  Overall this place is alright and I can't wait to try some other items and hopefully I can give this joint a better review next time around.",

    "text": "The customer service here isn't the greatest, but my SO and I have recently discovered that their fish tacos are actually pretttty darn good.  Every taco has a nice, meaty cut of fish. No skimpy filet here! We order it Cajun, as I'm sure the regular grilled fish tastes bland or rather ordinary. The Cajun fish tacos are best with citrus slaw and is worth the few extra cents. Although the fish is inconsistent (sometimes perfectly flaky, other times, dry), I really do enjoy the flavors: the fish is spicy and flavorful, the slaw is crunchy and tangy, and the tortilla it is so delicately wrapped in is slightly sweet.  I honestly don't feel comfortable sitting here or staying too long. It doesn't look very neat. The walls are a cool shade of blue and covered in posters and signs. Coming inside, there's a bar to the right, which I assume is for sports fans who like to chomp on burritos while watching a game.   Overall, I'd endure having to talk to someone with little to no genuine interest in customer satisfaction just to have a few perfect bites of fish-y goodness... To go, of course.",

Second time was yesterday afternoon a man bartender who looks very unkempt not dirty just dishovel might be good word. Sat with 2 friends all order the same thing and again you get what you order.

    "text": "I've been curious about Wahoo's since I saw it appear in Boca Park. I'm probably behind the times here, it's probably been open for YEARS, but I've never made my way here.   Typically I head to Rubio's if I want fish tacos, but I happened to be in the area and Wahoo's was close. Because I'm comparing the fish tacos to many, many fish tacos I have eaten in my day the rating is low.   The inside of the restaurant is a little out-there for me - the artwork on the tables, the over-done surfer theme, etc. I get it, but it's kind of too in your face.  Service was OK. I got my food to-go so I can't comment on much besides the woman who took my order. I asked for recommendations and she couldn't really help me out, so I just said, give me fish tacos. But then I had to go through - do I want them Cajun style? Do I want a combo? Do I want cole slaw/regular dressings on them? The good thing here is - the variety.  I ended up with a 2-taco combo with brown rice and black beans. The rice was disappointing mostly because I expect rice to have a bit more flavor at joints like this, especially with the \"taco\" theme (think: spice, not: bland). Beans were well-cooked and flavorful.   Tacos - I got one of each: one regular fish, one Cajun flavored. Believe me, get the Cajun flavored all the way. The regular fish taco was a huge let down compared to the Cajun. I also got the slaw topping, which was OK, save for the bits of CILANTRO I had to pick out of my tacos. *shakes in disgust* All in all the flavors are there, but these fish tacos were a bit on the small side IMO.  Overall I've had better fish tacos elsewhere and I will most likely be heading to Rubio's the next time I have a craving.",

    "text": "I went in last night to have a drink and enjoy my Friday evening after work. Everything was great! The doors were open and the breeze was blowing in. The atmosphere was exciting and everyone was having great conversation, talking about the sports games, cheering on, and having a blast! The bartenders were friendly and made sure that everyone had drinks and food. Everyone was being greeted and my expectations were exceeded. The night was perfect!  And then a couple came in that was clearly upset about something and probably drunk before they walked in. They immediately tried to turn a great night into a race war.  Meanwhile, everybody was minding their own business and having a great time.  They tried very hard to make something big out of a conversation that had nothing to do with them.  They left after they unsuccessfully tried to race bait and pin customers against each other, but everyone ignored them and carried on with their night. The drunk guy came back about an hour later and tried to fight the bartender. The bartender just tried to get him out and protect the bar and customers. I've been in there many times and never saw this happen before.  This was an isolated incident that had a premeditated motive. Thanks to the bartender that stood up to protect the girl bartender and customers and to get him out so he didn't try to fight anyone else! The atmosphere there is great and I will continue to come back!",

A woman named April who ran the food over was so unpleasant, I asked her for a different salsa then she said \"we only have pico\" with an attitude, hmm last time i checked Pico de gallo is not salsa! But whatever, so the food is suppose to be famous for their fish tacos? Okay the fish was absolutely delicious ; however the slaw on the taco was bland, the rice and beans  were bland. For this place to be famous because of there fish tacos is sad because ive had better at Del Taco and the girls they have working in the front belong in a fast food restaurant as well because they have no idea what customer service is ! I ordered a drink right before I left and the girl April hears me does not respond at all for a good 60 seconds as she is continuing to do her side work and then she finally asked me \"okay what drink did u want\" I will never im my life eat here or recommend this place to anyone ! Not to mention that awful Cigarette smell coming in from the outside deck . Awful, I really hope this place reevaluates their operation! Now I understand why there was barley anyone inside!",

    "text": "I used to come here often...both with the kids for food and also with the guys for drinks at the bar.  Tough to beat $2 Pacificos all night long.    We visited last Friday night for dinner at around 7pm and the restaurant was empty.  I believe there was one other table of diners and about 7-8 rowdy drinkers at the bar.  One of the reasons we stopped coming to the bar was they attract a rough crowd.  Tattoos, smoking pot in the parking lot... Not passing judgment... Just not my scene.    So tonight we order and sit at our table.  They had one guy working the cashier.  A young guy with black spiky hair.  The same guy was also delivering food to the tables.  Even though the restaurant was empty, he provided such poor service we'll never return to a Vegas Wahoos again.  We'll just wait until we go to Huntington Beach where they do it right.    When he delivered the first portion of our food, I asked him for the green sauce.  He gave me a look as if I was being a pain, but he returned with the sauce.  When he returned with the rest of our order, my son asked for a knife.  He literally rolled his eyes and went straight to the bathroom.    Now I know it's annoying when guests asked for things...especially when they don't ask for them at the same time, but our whole table was shocked at his response.  We looked at each other and waited to see whether he was going to come back.  Finally my 12 year old son got up and went behind the kitchen area to get his own knife!!!   Hahaha.  Unbelievable.  When the guy returned from the bathroom, I figured he would deliver the knife.   Nope...he stood in front of the TV and watched sports!!!  Check out the photo!!!    The founder of Wahoo's was here at the grand opening.  He should reconsider his choice for area developer.  They know nothing about customer service.",

    "text": "As a California native saying I was excited to find not just one but at least THREE Wahoo's in Las Vegas is an understatement. My girlfriend and I would frequent the location near the 215 and Rainbow off Sunset quite often on our lunch breaks. The staff was great and knew us by name, but it never really felt like a Wahoo's like back home. There were no windows :(  By luck we found this Wahoo's while on a work errand one day. WHAT. A. TREAT. We happened to sit down at the outside bar at just the right time of day and just the right time of the year. The breeze blowing on our backs kept us cool as the sun beat down from the sky. The tasty ice cold draft Pacifico ran down my throat and at the exact time we silently soaked in the glory, turned to look at each other and realized we had found it. It felt JUST like we were sitting on the Southern California Coast. It feels JUST like home. There is a open patio with couches and a fire pit next to the indoor/outdoor bar, and the corner location is perfect boasting floor to ceiling windowed walls. It's nice and open.  I've always been a huge fan of the Baja-ladas. Flour tortillas filled with chicken, tomatoes, spinach, and cream cheese. Pair that with a frosty draft beer and you are set.  This Wahoo's has a \"house special\" green sauce. They mix some spicy chili powder goodness into the already great green sauce. BOMB DOT COM.  The location of this Wahoo's is to-die-for. It's located right smack dab in the middle of Boca Park surrounded by great shops and minutes from Red Rock Casino.  I can't deny that I am SUPER stoked to be moving into my new apartment right around the corner from here very soon!!",

Salads are super filling and have tons of creative ingredients which is rare-also they're super reasonable... tonight I decided to be extra chubby and try the taco sampler-which prompted this review.  Chicken, fish and carnitas-all bomb! My fav was the carnitas. The chicken was nice and not dry as I'd expected. The fish was good as well which I don't like fish usually.  I'd say you can feel good eating here and also feeding your family here.",

We came in,  the place was empty,  the person at the counter didn't greet us, she just stood there staring at the mat on the counter that displayed some food and messed with it.   After a few minutes we asked if we could order,  she mumbled something. I asked which was better,  carne asada or carnitas, she said they were both good. I asked which was better,  Jessica was tight lipped, and refused to voice a preference.  I wanted to go to Hussongs. My daughter chose this. They have Dos Eqis Amber, which I love.  Joshua was pleasant when delivering the food,  the bartender was quick with my beer, and happy to give me a chilled glass. The food is good. Once we cleanser ourselves of the negativity we experienced while ordering,  all will be fine.",

It was all delicious and filling. The paleo bowl is so good with lots of veggies and a good and generous portion of shrimp. I ended up eating half of it and letting hubby eat the rest because I got full. The taquitos were nice and crispy, not oily like other places have. There was a really nice man, I wish I got his name. :/ He was very acommodating with lowering the volume of the music outside so hubby and I can talk to each other. He checked on us a couple times and made sure that everything was to our liking. He even brought some delicoous cinnamon chip dessert-like thing. It was a kind gesture and made my experience quite the positive one. :)",

We mentioned to the staff that their site and ordering on line indicated they were closed at 3 PM.  However, it was 6 and they were open.  Because of the Final Four games, we were afraid they were going to be overcrowded, so when they weren't I suggested that it may be that their app indicated they were closed.   I do love the fish - Wahoo - grilled.  Choice of beans - black and Choice of Rice Brown.  Always order the green sauce on the side!",

No. Believe me, there's more to say. I just moved to this side of town and am SO EXCITED that there's a Wahoo's near me.  Their Chicken Tortilla soup is SO legit.  I stopped in last night about 30 minutes before they closed and was so sad that they had closed a little early because it was so dead (first week of school I guess).  BUT THEN, the owner (or maybe manager?) saw how sad my face was and he opened back up for us!! WHAT?!??! Awesome customer service.    Oh - and they have a fully stocked bar too.  I don't usually drink when I'm getting casual Mexi, but I think I may have to change that - they have about every kind of liquor you can imagine (and every flavor of Vodka you can think of).    Like Arnold says, \"I'll be back!\"",

It is overall a pleasant experience, and I will say my husband is a big fan. Despite all of this, I have yet to find a dish that I find irresistibly delicious.

I got the 3 minute burrito with cajun chicken smothered in green sauce. The chicken was very good, it was at least a whole breast of chicken cut up into big squares. The problem was the green sauce. It was some sort of cilantro cream sauce which would have been good if they hadn't of used 5 lbs of cilantro to make it. It was very overpowering and had that odd taste you get when you put way too much cilantro in something. The person I was with loves cilantro and it was even too much for her to handle.  The chips were decent and the guacamole was good. The green sauce just threw me for a loop because I expected a green chili sauce or a tomatillo sauce and then got this weird cilantro packed cream sauce. I think it would have tasted good if they could cut way back on the amount of cilantro they are putting in there.",

Went in with my wife for a beer and taco and the waitress passed by 5 times and hung out on the other side of the bar. Even served the man beside us and just completely ignore . Finally asked if we were getting served and she just walked away to the other side. We decided to leave after 10 minutes of this and asked her name...answer CAN'T YOU READ, step into the bar to get her name as she was hiding it and got told to get the hell out of her bar.Yelling and screaming get the hell out of my bar!  Called her boss, on vacation for 2 weeks and contacted head office in Cali. At first they emailed right back, then it was we have to see video, then it was main guy was away. Finally local manager contacted me and we meet. Now this guy comes up with some story we were cursing at her, and some older lady agreed( think it was a friend of the bar tender??)so she was justified. Maybe I should have but sorry still a gentlemen. I'm 64 yrs old and my wife was with me , why would I embarrass myself in a 2 bit surf bar such a way. Conclusion I stopped the emails as they hoped it would just go away.  The owners acted the same as the staff, JUST IGNORE THE ISSUE IT WILL GO AWAY! I own 2 business and my staff would have been let go instantly for this service, oh yea but I forgot she was friends with the owner and had a gaming clientele. You just gotta go there and have the short fat one with the twin peaks serve you, sorry ignore you. If you love to be abused, lied and threatened  this is the place for you. Conclusion the business is a reflection of its leadership WORST BAR IN MY 64 YEARS  MANAGEMENT AND OWNERSHIP. AND YOU CAN GO FOR ABUSE TOO !",

The young lady who said she was the manager took my plate and told me it looked like my hair! Not once an apology-- only an attitude! Wouldn't it make sense if the hair was just on the plate?... It appeared as though the hair was cooked into the clump!  Please store owners require some education or educate your staff on customer service. She brought me another plate and still didn't apologize. She just told me how there were no females in the kitchen, so, how the hair got in there was uncertain.  I did decline. I just couldn't trust what was done to the food... Sad too, because there are hungry people in our communities. Again, the hair was clumped into rice/cheese.... Oh well! I was really looking forward to the carnitas!  I will not return!",

You would think the manger of all people could get an order right but didn't. He didn't even write our order down which says a lot, bc it's 50/50 if it's going to come out correct. Which at the time I placed the order I assume he was just the bartender but then finding out he himself was the manger he should of known first hand the waitress or waiter is suppose and should always write the order down. Got our order wrong the first time it was brought out then.. Sent it back.. Then had the nerve to pull the waitress aside a table over from me and tell her what I ordered, Wasnt was what I ordered casually.. Like it didn't matter.. How rude and unprofessional. 1st off I did order it the right way but probably bc he didn't write anything down it came out wrong, along with my husband order as well. Anyways we ended up leaving and pissed off... Not a happy customer and will never go back as long as he's behind the bar! #pissed!!!!!!",

The fish tacos are very good, the spicy salsa is awesome.  The white rice is very tasty, unlike major chain competitors with similiar fare and the black beans tasty as well.    Went again on another trip and tried the Kahuna Grande: selected the spicy fish taco and chicken taquitos w/guac & sour cream - very good, not greasy at all (they do not use lard), tried the white beans I like better - quite saucy with a bit of zip.  Tried the Wahoo's salad with grilled Cajun fish - this is spicily wonderful!  The fish portion was as long as the platter (not bits of meat chopped up), and the cilantro dressing quite tasty!  Try it -very nice atmosphere!",

He comes back with the food which wasn't even done well and forgets to put in the chips and salsa which I paid for. After telling him he forgot the chips, he comes back with a bag with about ten chips and one thing of salsa (when I paid EXTRA) for more salsa. All in all in was probably the worst takeout experience I've had. Bad service. Food was cold. No extra salsa that I paid for (which is ridiculous you have to pay for extra salsa). If you want Mexican food, you're better off with taco bell. Sad.",

Stopped by here for lunch with a couple of co-workers and was saddened to have to skip on beer margaritas (they have those!).  I had the fish, shrimp, and steak with kimchi tacos; chips and salsa; cajun fries; and churro chips. I normally don't care too much for chips and salsa but their salsa was pretty good. Chunky with a good spice level. The cajun fries could have been fried for a few extra minutes. I like my fries crispy, though their's wasn't soggy but it wasn't as crispy as I'd like my fries to be. Churro chips are a unique spin on churros. I love churro's and wish they actually had the real deal. What they have is tortilla chips fried and sprinkled with brown sugar and cinnamon.  Now the tacos I loved! Surprisingly my favorite was the kimchi steak taco. I tend to skip anything steak unless I'm at a steak house. The steak was cooked tender and I did not have any chewy pieces (I hate that), and the kimchi made it ever so flavorful. The fish and shrimp tacos had slaw on top and were delicious as well.  Service is fast and friendly and prices are super reasonable. Tacos are about $3 a piece.  Next time around I'll come on my day off so I can try the margaritas!",

There was a good amount of fellow football fans who had the same plan.   You can definitely tell this place has a lot of good regulars, but if you're a newbie you aren't ignored. As someone that isn't a drinker, I get left hanging at other places after they hear my water order...NOT THE CASE AT ALL HERE. Marisela was eager to grab my water and even dropped off a menu, in the midst of her full bar of customers.   Shortly after, my food order goes in (I'm a taco fiend so naturally that was what ordered) on a busy day like this it was out surprisingly fast, and was exactly what I hoped for. I was continuously checked on and was asked if there was anything I needed, I seriously couldn't count on both hands how many times I was checked...I love that! Even a low spending visitor is treated like something special.   I'll definitely have to return to the place some time in the future, Sunday mornings Marisela seems to be the favorite, but I heard many GREAT things about another employee who was simply called \"Floody\". Every assumed regular I met seems to love them both. Even though I'm not much of a drinker, the employees, service and tacos are more than enough for me to return!",

It wasn't super crowded at all which was nice because we easily got the bartenders attention every time we needed it. The outside/inside vibe of the bar is pretty awesome this time of year. I hate to say it, but I really can't comment on their drink selection because I am 25 and still am not well versed in alcohol. I usually stick to what I know which is either a Moscato or a Light Beer with Lime. They have light beer and limes but not the kind with the lime built into it, and they have white wine but not Moscato. I got bartenders choice of white wine and liked it and a blue moon which was good. We had quite a fun laugh when I accidently called light beer \"diet beer\" and thoroughly embarrassed my date.   Happy hour chips and salsa was $1 a pretty decent appetizer. My partner in crime got the nachos, and they were pretty legit. Not special as far as the ingredient deck but just a good example of well-made bar food. I got one fish taco - I honestly prefer  Rubio's so I wouldn't come here for their fish tacos. It was slightly dry and the fish had the texture of chicken. I also got their cajun fries. They were normal fries, lol, they had a little cajun seasoning but once you dipped you couldn't even taste it.   So a fun bar with loud TV's and a good atmosphere that isn't super busy even during the game.  The food is A-OK - so three stars. I'll be back.",

I'm just sad they didn't have coke products. They did however have a bar so they do serve alcoholic beverages as well as a cooler upfront by the cashier to grab a beer. It was also weird how you place your order, pay, sit down, they bring it out to you and you leave the trash and everything in the table. It's confusing. So just a heads up leave it. Don't sit there looking around like I did for a trash can. I feel like they should just add trash cans so you don't feel like you have to leave a tip with your plate & trash.",

Another review, for another location, mentioned how healthy, tasty, and low-cal the shrimp burritos are here, and that is what I came for.  Ordered to go. Loved the beachy atmosphere with the tiki bar area, projected surfing/ocean scenes, and chill music. This is easily a place I could hang out for a while.  Service was friendly. Waited for my order at the bar, where I was asked for my ID even though I was just waiting. Bartendress was super sweet and apologetic about it.  Got the classic shrimp burrito, total was under $7 but it's not a burrito that is a meal on it's own (for my massive appetite). Flavors were good and fresh, simple shrimp in a teriyaki-like sauce with a bit of kick to it. Cabbage slaw, cheese, and very little else kept things fresh and healthy: no rice and beans in here! Noticed they also had signage up that they'd recently added salmon to the menu- asked what cost would be for a salmon burrito on my next visit, and price was still under $7. Not bad at all!  Very pleasantly surprised by food quality, pricing, interior decor, and service here.  Side note: Gave an extra star for their transparency with nutrition info. Their website has an easily-found PDF file, their store has a printout, containing every dish offered here, with all meat combinations and condiments, with calorie listings and other data for health-conscious diners! Every place should offer this!",

    "text": "Just about as good as the rest.  Whenever we used to drive to Cali for vacation, we almost always stopped at Wahoo's for some fish tacos!  Was just part of the trip.  Now...wow, we have multiple locations here in Las Vegas!  Who knew fish could swim to the desert?  All the same food available at other Wahoo's can be had here.  They are turning into quite the chain!  Please guys don't get too much bigger because I would like the quality and down-home feel to stay the same.  Don't overdo corporate!  Biggest difference here?  The ambiance.  In Cali I'm used to seeing surfers, skaters, and bums all partaking in the ritual that is a fish taco.  Now here in Vegas?  Businessmen, casino workers, and soccer moms!  What is going on?  Where is the sand?  Well we do have sand.  Where is the sun?  Well we do have sun.  Where is the smell of salt water and sun tan lotion?  It truly makes a difference.  My fish taco experience always follows with the smell of the beach and an ice cold Corona.  I do it like Vin Diesel & Paul Walker do!  It just feels off here in Las Vegas!  Luckily the food is still A-OK.  Lots of healthy and nutritious eats with decent prices.  Although I did notice the prices at this location seem a tad higher than some of it's Cali counterparts.  No matter, at least now I don't have to drive to another state for my fish taco fix!  I usually go to Wahoo's and order the same thing every time.  The combo with a fish burrito, fish taco, rice & black beans.  I love that teriyaki sauce they have so I always get a side of it for my burrito and my rice.  Asian I guess, can't get away from the soy sauce!  I love the crunch the cabbage provides on the fish taco, and I have a hard time replicating it at home.  Must be the fish I'm guessing, my damn cheap @$$ tilapia fillets aren't cutting it.  I enjoy the simple dressing on the burrito:  fish, pico de gallo, and their 'white sauce' (which I'm hoping is a sour cream concoction).  I kick that sucker up with teriyaki sauce and Tapatio....muy delicioso!  The side of rice & black beans fill my belly up to full.  Not a bad combo for around $8.    I've had their chicken and beef before on the tacos and burritos (and it's alright), but I constantly come back to the beloved fish taco.  Seems to be my favorite staple at Wahoo's.  Yeah...hello...Wahoo's FISH TACO!  So the damn fish better be good.  This Wahoo's has a nice large bar area attached to the restaurant, and I can see that it is bustling most nights.  Probably have some happy hour specials I need to inquire about.  But the place is mainly a grab-and-go or stay for a quick meal type of place.  There's noise everywhere, so don't come here for no intimate date!  As long as the crowds come and the food stay consistent, this Wahoo's should be just fine.  But guys, stop creeping up on the prices, eh?  That's like a great white shark ruining your wave.  Or Tara Reid, surviving the onslaught that is 'Sharknado'.",

We go to Mexico and Hawaii fairly often and always get fish tacos, so our bar for tasty tacos is high. The tacos here were average. We also had the steak teriyaki and it was lackluster as well. The teriyaki sauce was runny and bland.   On top of all that, the soda machine was out. Of course we didn't know that until we got our drinks and took a swig of water and soda syrup. Yuck! We told an employee walking by and they told us that they knew about it and were trying to fix it. About 20 minutes later, we hadn't seen anyone about the soda, even though we saw them bring in soda in cans they had bought for people to have, but i didn't see any of those passed out either. We couldn't ask them to give us one because we couldn't get anyone to come over to us. Everyone seemed to be running around crazy like. I would have hoped to get sodas since we paid for them, but we never did nor did we get a refund on them. Quite disappointing.   When we were getting ready to leave, and quite thirsty, a little boy, maybe 10 and obviously the owner's kid, came by with a sweet treat for my daughter and gave us coupons to come back. He was nice and cute and redeemed the place a little, but we were so thirsty and annoyed at the service that we were over it.",

    "text": "So, normally I'm a big fan of Wahoo's. I usually lobby my girlfriend into going at least a couple times a month. I really enjoy their wet (with Green Sauce) outer reef burrito, accompanied by wahoos Mr. Lee's sauce. It's pretty enjoyable. I've given them three stars because I don't know what's happened as of late, but I feel like I'm always getting skimped when coming here. You pay up front before you've received any food, and everything cost extra. .75 for this, an extra 1.50 for that, blah blah blah. Turns out by the time you get 2 burritos, about 13 chips with salsa, plus the salsas are not something that's included,and a drink each it comes out to the best part of $40.  Don't get me wrong I've paid it before and I'll probably pay it again, but every time I go, the fish in the burrito is smaller, what used to be refilled chips with salsa is now $3 or $4 bucks every time you want 13 more chips. The serving staff has become awkward, always on their phones, not paying attention to what's happening inside, there's a bar tender, older guy with a goatee, and other than the fact he's seen us 50 times he asks to see our ID every time, he's the only really nice personable guy there.  I guess why it sucks is Wahoo's has always been somewhere I've been excited to go, but who wants to go to a place where they already know they're going to get screwed (not in the good way) before they even eat their meal? I'm worried of it sliding further downhill and I hope things go back to the way they were before.",

I was not at all interested in the food after the 1rst bite.  I could bor even finish my meal. It wasnt burnt or rotten. It was just as if the cook started cooking yesterday and he is working here today. Not even up to par with fast food.   I am just being honest.  But, some people prefer the atmosphere and don't mind the food I guess. Or maybe I am too picky?",

I ordered my meal to go and ordered 2 Cajun tacos with brown rice and black beans-with the green sauce on the side.  After I paid (it was around $8) the lady gave me my reciept and walked away. Doootadooo.... I stood there wondering if I should wait or should I find a seat???  Hm I made my way to a table to wait for my food.  While I waited I was checking out the great beachy decor.  The patio looks so amazing.  I will definitely be back for that.  Sent me right back to the laid back outdoor beach bars in California. Sigh.   My food was brought to me and I was on my way.  The cashier yelled \"have a great day\" and that made up for leaving me in limbo afew mins ago. When I got back to the office it was on!  The tacos were great.  I couldnt tell if the tacos were spicy of the green sauce I was pouring on it was.  Love spicay!  I did notice that one taco had cheese and one didnt.  Not quite sure why or how that happened but either way they were pretty good.  BTW green sauce is fat free a huge plus. ;)  The rice and beans I had a little of but the tacos pretty much filled me up.  So yes the atmosphere is cute, laid back and fun.  I definitely will be back to get my drink on - ON the patio this time and for sure will be doing the quicky lunch on my lunch break.  Nice guilt free lunch...just what I was looking for.  Success! =)",

    "text": "1st of all, I consider this a hidden gem around boca park. Its not your typical taco shop but more of a up scale type. I tried the Kelua pork bowl with brown rice and man! Its bomb!!! I expected it to literally be in a bowl but it was served in a big plate with some veggies and beans. I can't wait to try other dishes but so far, it is very very tasty.  2nd of all, alot of parking stalls so it is not a problem. One thing to keep in mind is the lunch rush hour, we arrive around 12pm and a line greeted us. It did not take long though a good 10 min wait, but the great part of it. A big menu is facing your direction so you would not notice the time while reading other dishes.  Lastly, I love the decorations focused more in a Hawaiian theme well it gives right. Wahoo Fish Taco, you will find many brands around the area. From a signed surf board to snowboard.",

If you're part of the service industry crowd you get %30 off your bill, that's pretty cool too. The service is friendly. This time I went late night on a Wed, I found food was served till Midnight and the place closed at 1am. I think thats a pretty good deal considering the place is in Boca park where most restaurants are closed.  They have plenty of seating- outside too!   I think the seafood is absolutely delicious, they have their own recipe of green sauce, and I think my only complaint is that the tortillas are pretty crappy (falling apart, soggy etc). They should definitely invest in a better vender for tortillas ;b Oh and the enchiladas were so tasty! I had a green/cheese shrimp enchilada. AMAZING.",

I'm SoCA transplant so I really like the Wahoo's locations down at or near the beach.  They just seem to have better flair and flavor.  I'll still go to Wahoo's in Vegas... but I long for the Wahoo's of SoCA.  The Summerlin location has a small patio area so when it's nice outside you can get some Vitamin D.  However the patio is like sitting in the parking lot.  They also have a bar area so you can sit and have a beer at the bar while enjoying your fish tacos.  My \"go to\" dishes at Wahoo's is always the fish tacos or the fish plate. IMO... this last Friday I ordered the Fish Plate... Grilled with White Rice and Black Beans.  The fish was dry... the rice was dry and flavorless... the black beans were ok.    The salsa and guac were fresh and very good.  NET, NET.... I'll frequent Wahoo's because I keep hoping it'll be as good as the ones in SoCA...",

At first it was overwhelming so many options with lots of different combinations.   The tacos were really pretty tasty. Fish tacos with the slaw was really good. Fish was moist and meaty, able to stand up to the toppings, but at the same time, it was light and refreshing.   The Cajun beans were spicy, but not great, soft and mushy. The rice was also kinda soft and lacking architecture to hold the beans and the combo meal together.  The prices are good and the servings were super large. The place was cute, but a little messy at the end of the day (understandable). It also seems like the kind of place that could get super busy and hectic.",

Well, okay, it's not.... BUT it's darn good for a grilled fresh fish taco and considering I'm in the middle of the desert, that's pretty awesome!    I have a hard time deciding between the original style vs. the citrus slaw bc both are equally yummy in my opinion: the citrus slaw is fresh and compliments the fish well, but the green sauce is soooo good!  I always just end up ordering one of each! Problem solved!  The decor here is casual surfer/skater hangout, and they're always playing chill rock/alt that reminds me of carefree high school days in the sun. The bar always has at least 2-3 people there (even in the early weekday afternoon!), and I can only imagine it being more popular after work lets out.   I live so close to Boca Park, I'll be back often!! Kowabunga dude!  PS- free wifi!",

You can choose your protein choice (e.g. chicken, shrimp, tofu) ; my children opted for fried fish (grilled fish is also available). Each plate costed under $4.

The tables and seating areas were clean. TV's aired sports which was just the happy medium (relieved to have no news or no Cartoon Network).   The bathrooms are gender neutral which makes it easier when I am helping my children. The slide locks on the doors are placed up about 5' which can make it a little tricky.

I came in to meet a friend with a cold unfortunately, and and my friend recommended to try a \"hot tottie\" which is usually an inconvenience to most bar tenders. Rob didn't break a sweat and broke them out like it was no ones business. It was seriously awesome.  Came in a week later to visit the same friend and was pleased to meet Marisela! Seriously the cutest bartender I've seen in this town! Very attentive, very nice, always paying attention to her guests, making sure everyone is okay. I appreciated hearing that from a bartender in this town, it's very uncommon honestly.   I seriously can't wait to return. I hear there's a guy called \"Fluddy\" that's supposed to be the man here. Can't wait to meet him too. Seriously this is my new spot in Boca Park!",

Thanks to the great rotation of bartenders of Fluddy, Marisela and Isaac, it's always a good time with them.   One thing that is super important to me about this place is that it's a smoke free bar. I've always hated leaving other places smelling like smoke. The crowd here is always fun, no rowdy college kids, nothing but fun people.   Naturally this is a go to spot for me because I'll never turn down tacos. But the best sports games are always on, all the bartenders I always deal with are awesome. Always fun, attentive, and super friendly. Thank you Fluddy, Marisela and Isaac for continuing to make this place so much fun. I'll be a customer for life as long as these three are here!",

    "text": "Great location, lots of individually-cable-boxed TVs, and cheapish beer. The food? Not great, but what I refer to as \"reliable\". (Still doesn't mean it's good.) Best bet are the a la carte enchiladas (menu says 3.49/each but they actually ring up less - don't tell anyone) and if you ask for pico de gallo on top, it's free, and you get a big smother of it on your enchiladas. UPDATE (5/24/2017): The enchiladas no longer ring up less, and they charge you for pico de gallo. The squeaky wheel got the grease - sorry!  Always pass on the carne asada here (it's super minced-up and can be rubbery) but do get the carnitas and/or the spicy fish as proteins. The best in-house hot sauce is Dexter Holland's own Gringo Bandito, which is another plus. They also have the standard Tabasco, Cholula and Tapatio trifecta.  The retractable garage-door in front of the bar is always open - and this place is almost never crowded. My guess is that it sustains itself on video poker revenue? Foodwise, this store probably does 15-20% of the business that the Huntington Beach location does - at best. I hope they stick around!",

My mom said hers was inedible.   Her flour tortilla was cold, hard, and crusty.  The onion, zucchini, bell pepper, and broccoli mix was bland and oily. The mushrooms tasted fishy, which was gross, and that flavor seeped into my tofu, too.  My mom commented that she wished we would have driven to Taco Bell instead. Unfortunately, I couldn't disagree. And I don't eat at Taco Bell.   The white rice was ok.  Perhaps most important to note is that I got sick about an hour and a half after eating.   I've enjoyed Wahoo's food from a location in Henderson, so I'm not sure what happened here. Due to this experience, though, I doubt we'll try a Wahoo's again.",

I'll give them the fact that it was getting late in the night, but the girl who was cleaning and taking our orders at the same time seemed a little annoyed that we were here to eat.  The food was OK as well.  I wasn't impressed with the chicken breast tacos (got one grilled and one Cajun).  It is hard to compare to the awesomeness of a Roberto's Chicken Taco.  The rice and beans were OK as well.  Nothing to write home about.  It was rather loud and the fact that it has a bar in the restaurant made for some unneeded distractions when trying to sit down and have a meal.  I wouldn't take my kids here, that's for sure.  If you haven't been here yourself, go ahead and give it a try.  Otherwise, I would suggest going to a Roberto's for some Mexican food.",

Add to this our family of more than 2 adults, that all have different food preferences. So getting the items separated makes it easier for everyone to try a bite of something different - this was our first time ever, eating at Wahoo's and they Rock. They put everything in separate containers as requested and EVEN labeled each item (above and beyond) and the delivery was 10 min early on a Saturday - 5 stars - but gave 4 because some of the food didn't taste as we expected, it was yummy but each of us like different things and different parts, so overall the food WAS really good, from what we ordered we recommend: chicken Outer Reef Burrito - chicken SCReaM'N Burrito - steak Street Tacos - you're on your own when it comes to the sauces, because again we differ on choices. heads up if you do not like cilantro, don't get the green sauce - which is quite tasty if you DO like cilantro - but cilantro is love it or hate it, and this applies to the green sauce here, as some loved it, and some didn't ...",

The hardest things to convey to a service staff is to anticipate guests needs and recover from mistakes. They have obviously done a great job of that. Kudos!  I love the Cajun style fish and shrimp tacos. Really fresh on perfectly soft, corn tacos. BTW, their happy hour is pretty freakin awesome to take advantage on their indoor-outdoor patio. Way more of a bargain and laid back atmosphere than Kona Grill --in the same lot.

So tonight I begged my husband to go and told him I'm sure it would be different and they'd be as good as they used to be! But I was way wrong! It was a bad experience from the get go. The staff had less personality than a wet rag, the ice tea dispenser was empty and when we got home with our order (I had ordered the salmon bowl) there was no slaw on my salmon. So it was just rice and salmon. My fault for not checking before we left but still... Also the salmon and rice was like eating a salt lick! I've never had anything like it before! So needles to say my husband got to say I told you so and I was disappointed. We won't be going back.",

She over charged the credit card so she could keep the cash, after disputing it with the manager he said he'd charge the right amount on the card and said that it would even it out? HELLO how would that even out? Why is it okay for your employee to steal our cash when we wanted two forms of payment? Why are you still charging us? You should have refunded the card back and fired your employee. Also your bartender was taking shots with other customers couldn't even refill a drink.",

We also ordered a side of chips and guacamole and the guacamole was flavorless. The avocados did not even have a taste to them and I was really disappointed by it. The meat in the taco was the complete opposite and had tons of flavor and was delicious!   Environment: It is a casual, very laid back place with plenty of seating and very interesting decor.

The only addictive item at Wahoo's for me is Mr. Lee's sauce. I put that on everything. It costs $1 as a side, which is STEEEP considering the cheap menu.

Unfortunately, my order of cajun fish tacos came super late and the fish was very dry and bland. It was not an anomaly because both of my friends' fish dishes were dry as well. Did I expect too much out of this place? Not too excited about coming back and trying their other dishes. I mean, they're called Wahoo's FISH tacos. If they can't do fish right, why bother?  UPDATE: Went back and tried the carne asada beef. It was gray in color and bland. Seriously, not grilled - gray. After the meal, I had a stomach ache. Coincidence? I think not.",

It is a strange choice of location, situated on a corner with open doors and each side and wind blowing through. Nice but your view is the Target parking lot and party City.

This chain that originated in Orange County, CA, is familiar to all the SoCal transplants like me, but I've never had Wahoo's until tonight.  If you think all they have is fish, you'd be wrong (like me!).  The choice of fillings in addition to fish are chicken, carnitas, carne asada, shrimp, tofu, mushrooms (in a Polynesian marinade and sauteed), vegetarian, and Banzai veggies (a veggie mix sauteed in teriyaki sauce).  I'm happy to say that the food is fresh, abundant, and I'm glad that a location opened up in my 'hood.  I had the shrimp taco combination: 2 overflowing tacos, brown rice, and black beans.  I couldn't say no to the Maui Onion Rings so I had those, too, but maybe not the best combination with tacos.  Regardless, I am full!  The place is brand new, the service is great, and the ambiance is laid-back, just as if the beach were right outside the door.",

This Wahoo does not maintain the standards set in SoCal... Its standards have been slipping since it opened... Their salsa is not fresh (looks like it came out of a jar)... The fish is dry... They skimp on rice and beans... Their tofu is mushy and has no flavor or texture... They charge $2 for two corn tortillas (in CA you get three for 99c)... I think they are more concerned with the bar... Selling alcohol to folks who bang away on the poker machines... Its not the cool California taco shack I love...

    "text": "A nice slice of coastal goodness that reminds me of my hometown San Diego...except it's in a parking lot in Boca Park!  The food is tasty, but the menu is a little overwhelming.  The first time I went, I was like, \"Where are just fish tacos?\"  Apparently, you pick your vehicle (taco, burrito, etc.), then you choose your innards (fish, chicken, tofu (!), mushrooms (!), etc), then you choose your rice (brown rice option (!)) and beans.  The fish tacos were a little dry and I would have liked more sauce.  I also got some sort of tofu bowl that I don't remember the name of, and it was goooood.  I prefer the Cajun white beans to the black beans (great flavor), but the rice lacks something (read: flavor).  They have a full bar and a nice happy hour special each day.  They have this nifty margarita where they stick a mini Corona in it.  It's fun and very college-Spring-Break inspired.  But I think my favorite part of the restaurant is the open patio.  The window/wall opens up from the bar area to a nice little patio with comfortable seating.  My only wish was that it didn't over look a black asphalt parking lot, but I'll take some al fresco drinking and eating any day, and I'll just imagine that the black asphalt is ocean water while I eat my fish taco and drink my beer/margarita concoction.",

Chicken tacos were great too! They had messed up our order, but we were able to keep the mistake Taco (ordered chicken, got steak), and got chips and dip for free.   This place is a great find and I can't recommend it enough.",

I work very close to the one in Boca Park and finally remembered it was here.   OMG, I had the these Alaskan Flounder Tacos.....AMAZING!!!!  The slaw they put on top of the fish is citrusy and such a great compliment to some really good fish.  Service was great and friendly.  The menu is different from California but still really great.  I love this place and now that I've remembered it's here, I will be back more often.  If you're looking for a place to sit and enjoy a drink at the bar, this is the perfect place for it.  Great specials and really good size bar.  Great food, good drinks and great service.   Can't go wrong with a combination like that.",

This is the second of three Wahoos found in Clark County, all just slightly not as good as the originals in California but respectfully do take care of my fish taco cravings.   This location I actually prefer over the one off of Rainbow. Its a little brighter and the food is presented much nicer than the other one. One thing I can get on them about is that there are way too many people at the bar at 11 am. I mean really? Starting early much? Also the people at the front should pay a little more attention to the people willing to order instead of worrying about talking to the customers who are drinking.",

It sits in the same shopping area as Target, Starbucks, Justice (yes, I have two daughters), Total Wine, Tilly's and many other great places.    The family dined here and though kids are not allowed on the patio (which looks waaaay cool and comfortable given the right temperature and no summer winds), the inside is very cool, SoCal and beachy!  I love it!  There are TVs scattered throughout for my sports loving husband so that's always a bonus too.   We had the chicken tacos and Wahoo salad.  The Wahoo salad was great - not amazing, but I'd definitely have it again.  Hubby had the chicken tacos which he said were really good.  No real complaints -- the menu is pretty diverse, you can order a cheeseburger if that's what your tummy desires! My daughter had the kids quesadilla which she devoured, but quesadillas aren't exactly a trick to make. We also had the chips n salsa which also was fine, not the best, but it was fresh and not bottled which is always nice.   One thing - thus the less one star . . . . this is Vegas and the place is not air conditioned!!  Ceiling fans abound, but cmon, its 100 degrees outside.  Hubby was sweating as he ate his tacos!!  Maybe it makes for more beer drinking, I'm not sure, but A/C would've earned the 5th star Wahoo!",

Especially being so far inland...\"  I can tell you that this place has gone above and beyond anything that the SoCal locations have going.  The food is still great and cheap! $2.50 for a taco?  WTF are you kidding me?!  Pacificos $2?! So stoked!  Great food combined with a great staff led by bartender James \"Big Poppa\" is the recipe for a great overall experience!  I've made this place my home away from home.  I'm here almost 5 times a week, it's like having my own version of Cheers in my backyard... I sit down next to Norm, and Sam Malone already has my beer poured and my food on the way.  Couldn't ask for more.  If you've never been to a Wahoos start with a Cajun Fish taco and go from there, everything is good!  Sunday Brunch is also a great deal.  $6 gets you Carnitas with Eggs and all you can drink mamosas for an hour....  Sunday Funday! Give it a go if you can get up before 11:00am.

This place has two main attractions, dining room and the bar.  The dining room is set up in a seat yourself fashion. You first order, then you pick a place to sit, then they deliver your food to you by name.  I ordered a Wahoo (ono fished) grilled burrito wet. Both of the enchilada sauces are delightful. I asked to sample each and they let me get both (half and half). My food came out quickly and it was fresh.  The house salsa was lack luster. Nice veggie taste, but nothing special or memorable.  Mr. Lee's sauce was the business: sweet and spicy and thick. (I swear there is teriyaki in there). Get it! You'll thank me later.   The bar has great beer specials. They have a variety (Mexican and American) on tap and they are around $2.11 a piece and half that during happy hour.  If you're a single gal, this is a great place to go surfing for dudes.  I'm pretty WAHOO for Wahoo's!",

Nothing we had - from the fish tacos to the beans - blew us out of the water, but the ingredients are fresh, well prepared and the staff just couldn't be friendlier. Plus, they have a great bar with quick, knowledgeable bartenders (a rarity for the Summerlin area).  The vibe is very California-esque, the sheer variety of taco variations is sure to please most, and the quality of the food is just right for the price. Forget spending $20 at Taco Hell or any of the other abysmal chains, if you're craving unique, fresh tacos it's hard to go wrong at Wahoo's.",

When I got him the food was still warm and all the accessories (napkins, plastic utensils, etc) were in the bag.  The flounder tacos were very good.  I wish they offered more options featuring flounder, but it's limited to tacos.  I don't know when I'd return to dine in though because my spouse doesn't eat seafood and that is the main feature of their menu.  So, my visits will be few and far between.",

The staff was very accommodating to my food allergies. And even took the time to explain that their teriyaki sauce is also gf. Jackpot!!  Chips and salsa, taquitos, enchiladas. The enchiladas were the best choice smoothered in cheesey goodness. Will definitely be there again. Relaxed atmosphere, great vibe.",

We went in one day for lunch and one night after dinner for an adult beverage. The lunch bartender wasn't very sure about the ingredients they used in their slaw. For the record, they do not use mayo and it is vegan. The night time bartender informed us that they weren't open 24/7 even though it's advertised as such all down the outside wall. The bartender was super nice and the drinks were fairly priced. I wasn't too impressed with the food menu, but it wasn't horrible and it accommodated my life style. They have a few machines at the bar so I was surprised to hear that they actually closed. If you're hungry for tacos and can't find anything better in the area... this isn't a terrible place to stop.",

Not surprisingly, I didn't see OJ.   I did see poor service. There's a small patio out front that is a mouse-maze to get to. And nobody greeted or sat. I sat there for a while, ignored. I eventually had to haul up to the semi-outside bar to find out that the outside patio tables would not be waited. So I moved inside to a booth. The food was pretty mediocre, and overpriced for what it was. This town is brimming with better Mexi-taco sling-joints than this.  My overall read on this place is that if you want to get really really drunk, outside in the sun, while the loud music and tequila fuels your fantasy that you are in a Margaritaville dive bar, it'll work for ya. Otherwise not.  There's not much chance I'll return. Unless I catch a glimpse of OJ.   And even then it'll still be a coin-toss.",

I ordered a different dish and it had the same stomach-ache inducing taste and smell. Did they douse the meat in butane instead of cooking oil? It's as if the chef is noob or doesn't care and no one trained him. The beef was all oily, beans were undercooked, and what I got was not what was described on the menu, for both dishes. There is a big problem with their chef.  I still recommend coming here. Just make sure to eat first and stick to the drinks and the good atmosphere with the bartender and the friendly crowd.",

(Had to opt out of the free beer for checking in because of work :'(, but don't forget about it!)  The tacos have a good heft to them, being about $3.50 per taco, it was worth the price. They also provide a good variety of hot sauces at the table and even soy sauce - if that's your thing. The balance of flavor was great. There was crunch, citrus, and spice. Most importantly, there was enough fish to stand up to the toppings. The fish was also in large pieces and did not break apart while you ate.  Overall, great place for tacos with a casual, beachy atmosphere. Would come again to try other things on their menu.",

I haven't eaten one in years and figured I should check it out.   I got a grilled fish bowl which comes with a choice of beans and rice and a bit of pico garnish. Fish was a bit dry, they could have taken it off the grill sooner, beans and rice were standard and fine. The BF got a fish burrito and said it was alright.  Ask for some limes and sauces to dress it to your liking. They have sauces they don't really mention on the menu nor ask you if you want like their green sauce, white sauce, teriyaki or the Mr. Lees which is a spicy tomato paste sauce.  I feel like it was somehow better when in HS, but they've been in California for a long time.   Apparently this is a good spot to watch sports, and there is a patio to enjoy on nice days. Full bar and drink specials are available too.  It's a A-OK spot, specially if you are looking for a inexpensive, somewhat healthier food option.",

We had to flag her down and ask for what we needed. She never checked on us, I had to yell for her across the bar. Now I get it, you have your regulars. However, since we didn't feel welcome we won't become one of them. We also saw her unload the dishwasher. There was a piece of orange peel in with the clean dishes. Weird. I watched her reload and restart the dishwasher. She didn't remove the orange peel. If you like the food, just avoid the bar. Maybe go when Brea isn't working. Oh and stretch pants should be a dont period, but while you're working....ugh.",

It's not exactly hiding, but it's just in a location that very easy to not notice, at least for me, but now I always see it What I love about wahoos is the atmosphere. When I come for lunch it's a nice quiet restaurant, when I come for happy hour it's a raucous bar that happens to serve really good food. They have tons of drink specials from $2 pacificos, $6 patron and tons of nfl specials. The bartenders are always cool and good conversation even when it gets super busy The food is well above average, as everything is build your own so you can get fish or shrimp on <a href=\"/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2Fanything.im&s=736012518a48d74f7fe5549a5936a5d1faa5e5b27d1efba78d482e51d5e16dd4\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">anything.im</a> always there for a reef burrito and I throw fish on it.   TL;DR a very good environment reminiscent of SoCal with good Mexican food and cheap alcohol",

    "text": "Oh, what this place could have been!  Think of this place as the Vegas version of the little corner joint on Wilshire Blvd.  This place SO reminds me of calypso music:  the kind you listen to on an ultimate Sunday afternoon, lounging around with a glass of pina colada in your hand, getting slowly and happily drunk.  So ultimately my disappointment with the food will certainly get a chance to redeem itself the next time I go back.  Located in another \"oh, what it could have been\" place, Boca Park, you find yourself in a bright, surfing USA type setting with lots of bright color accents on white base.  The place has active but laid-back energy that fits the setting as well.  Upon walking in, there is an order counter in front, tables to the left and behind the counter, and a large bar to the right.  There are TVs everywhere including all around the large square bar, a perfect place to watch the games and drink to your delight.  You literally feel like you're at some divey surfer bar, sans the grime and sand.    The staff is pleasant and acceptably prompt, and orders are efficiently filled although I wouldn't say it's lightening fast.  We tried carne asada, pescado, and carnitas tacos, and all were acceptable without being outstanding.  It looks delicious, but is somewhat underwhelming and that 3-star food results in the loss of a big star from the 5-star setting.  However it is certainly more than adequate for Saturday and Sunday afternoons watching football, avoiding the typical dark, cave-like settings most bars seem to think everybody wants.  So it almost is the perfect sports bar - now only if they had better food and some calypso music!  Table-for-1 Factor:  I could see myself sitting at the bar for hours by myself...",

There's also an outdoor dining area attached tot he bar area that I would think would be awesome for parties.  I'm a fan of the food too - ingredient lists are readily available w/ carlorie count on my items as well.

Had a couple of really bad customer service experiences with their server, Candi, attempted to file a complaint about it and nothing was ever done.  I have spent a ridiculous amount of time just trying to get someone to acknowledge the issue and tell me they would look into it and they couldn't even give me that.  I was a regular for several months, spent my last birthday at this location, have NEVER had an issue worth filing a complaint about in my life and they just ignore me??  GREAT customer service!  You can check out my review on the Sunset store for more details about what went down.  Just sharing here because I know the management has gone back and forth between both of these locations.  I also heard that Candi was transferred to Boca Park once or twice because of issues she was having at the Sunset location.  Bottom line, if you have a complaint these people will NOT hear you out or do anything about it.  They just don't care about the customers so, in my opinion, they shouldn't have any.  If you've ever had an issue with Candi or any other servers please have enough respect for yourself to just walk away and take your business elsewhere.  These people don't deserve your money.",

    "text": "I first learned about Wahoos in Southern California, it was pretty much my everyday lunch during my summers spent in Huntington Beach and during the winter months I would go to the one across the street from my job in Valencia. To say the least, I love this place. So I figured I'd share my love for this place with my girlfriend - we'd been saying we were going to visit this one since we moved out here a year ago because she has never been.  Finally we were on our way to Target and hungry, so it was perfect timing.  I've been hyping this place up so much you'd think I had shares in Wahoo stocks or something.  We both got burritos and she also got the tortilla soup. To my disappointment, the soup was bland. Very bland. Like less flavor than Campbell's soup. It was literally chicken broth with an overload of canned veggies and a couple chunks of chicken. Needless to say she didn't finish it. After about 20 minutes of waiting for our burritos, we're discussing about just leaving and getting out money back due to the lengthy wait and lack of patrons. It didn't make sense.   In the midst of waiting we had the pleasure of seeing the place robbed. Literally. Some guy stole the cash drop from the cashier and ran out of there. Quite the scene, if you ask me. Not that it was the restaurants fault for that, but after seeing that, our appetites were lost. Got a refund and quickly left with our money, just like the guy who robbed the place, but legally.  Maybe next time Wahoos!",

Also love the decore makes you feel like your at a taco shop in Cali on the beach somewhere, weird how the place originated from Cali.

The girl who took our order was not friendly and even though she could tell it was our first visit, didn't help us in any way (there are lots of ordering options here).  She got two of the 4 orders wrong.  It took over 20 minutes for us to get our food which is ridiculous considering it was nothing more than taking prepared meats and putting them in a tortilla.  They completely lost the order of the guy who ordered in front of me.  The girl who took our order and then left the order station and began running food, all the time chatting on her cellphone.  When we finally got our food, the tortillas were very tough as though they had been sitting out all day.  The fillings (meats) were pretty good.

    "text": "To say I was disappointed would be an understatment. I planned a pub crawl for my husband's birthday,with one our stops being wahoo's. I went to all our stops that morning informing management that we would be coming through and around which time. All places seemed happy and accomidating as best they could. Manger of Wahoo's told me to call over when we were on our way. When I called (9:30pm) the hostess said management went home?!?! Quite confused I asked to speak to who was in charge. A bartender got on the phone. I told her I spoke to a manager earlier and we were on our way 20-25ppl. (not very interested)She said ok and hung up. Upon arriving the area in which I discussed with management that morning was not ready. The restuarant area was closed off? We had a friend in a wheel chair and had no access to the patio(you had to walk through the bar and between the high tops and bar.It was too narrow). So unfortunately we could not sit out there. We had to pull our own tables together. No one came to great us or offered to help. We all stood at the end of the bar together and waited for a bartender. The bar was not that packed and had two on staff at the time. One bartender finally came to help. In stead of staying there and getting through all our orders, she would take an order, leave help some other people and come back. All the while not letting us know she would be back. The other bartender stayed on her side of the bar and just chatted with others down there. Rather than help manage the bar. I must say that we had bartenders in our group as well as most of us live with in a 3-5mi radius of Boca Park. We heard no apology, heck we were barely spoken too. After taking over 45minutes for each of us to get a drink we decided to leave. We moved onto 3 ANGRY WIVES. They were ready for us. They kept an extra bartender and server on hand just to be ready for us. Job well done!! I'm sure they made a pretty penny off of our group. Especially since my husband and our friends like top shelf and lots of shots!!! Too Bad for Wahoo's as we will not be back and will be sure to tell everyone we know!!!!",

    "text": "The food here is 3 stars, but the service is one star. I met a friend for dinner at 5pm on a Friday. The bar was full, but the dining area only had two other people sitting in it and they already had their food. The waitress kept walking from the cash register to the kitchen every 3-4 minutes.  She never once stopped to ask for our drink/food orders. And she never even acknowledged us or said hi. After waiting for 15 minutes, we walked to the cash register to ask her when she would be able to take our order. She told us that their policy was for the customer to order at the cash register, and if we wanted another drink or anything else we would have to get up and walk back to the cash register. My friend and I have eaten here several times, an every time there was waiting staff. We ordered a drink, walked back to our table to look at the menu, and sat down. The waitress again walked right by us to go to the kitchen. Each trip to and from the kitchen put her within inches of our table. We walked up to the cash register to order our meal, but a male employee came from the kitchen to speak with the waitress just as we got there. The waitress gave us the finger (not the bad finger, she gave us the hold on finger). The two employees began to whisper and giggle with each other. I turned toy friend, and with our bff esp abilities we mutually agreed to go wait at Grimaldi's for 30 minutes for an open table. We paid four our drinks and left. I don't think my friend or I will be back at this Wahios ever again.",

    "text": "So.... I was very excited to eat at this place, I have only heard great things in other markets.  On a Saturday, the family and I were looking for a place to get some good food and watch some college football.  We walk in, and you order from the counter, not what I expected but I proceed. I order the fish taco plate, that's why I am here.  My husband orders the '3 Minute Burrito', and my kids order nachos, a steak taco and a fish taco.  $45 later, we get our number and take a seat.  We wait, and wait and wait for 28 minutes!!!  I get up to look for a manager or someone to assist me to get my food.  The runner speaks no English, neither does the kitchen staff.  Food finally arrives at the table.  It is only the 3 minute burrito, taking only 31 minutes. Then they bring the kids' plates.  The sides were wrong, the nachos looked like something I make in the microwave at home.  Not thrilled with the flavor profile of the fish taco, I have had better tacos at Rubios... (way better..) and for the service, price and cleanliness of the restaurant, I will not be going back.  People and businesses make mistakes all the time, but the lack of management, lack of knowledge of communication and the sheer expense with little to no ROI leaves me cold.  I don't mind spending the money if I am getting what I pay for.  Not the case here.  I hope this is not the rule with this place, but I will never know, I am not going back.",

The atmosphere lends itself to a beach hole-in-the-wall, but the reality is a smokey hole far from any beach freshness - food or air. We ordered the vegetarian nachos, outer reef burrito, wet classic burrito, quesadillas, and chicken taquitos all to-go. It took a over a half-hour to get our food, mostly because they kept giving us an incomplete order insisting it was complete. The food had very little flavor. The nachos and outer reef burrito reminded me of something you would throw together with what is left in your refrigerator - very uninspiring and dry. Speaking of dry, the wet burrito was hardly wet. The quesadillas were akin to cafeteria food. The chicken taquitos had more whole bay leaves in them than chicken. The chips were crisp but flavorless, and the \"salsa\" was equally so with a touch of heat. Obviously, won't be going back.",

While they make a tasty fish taco (and fish burrito), all of their dishes are swimming in the soapy herb. That's not really a problem for me, but my husband HATES cilantro, and it overpowered each bite of his burrito.  The staff was friendly, the prices were reasonable, and the atmosphere was laid back. And I like the fact that you have the option of white rice or brown, and white beans or black. But it's unfortunate that you don't really have the option of \"no cilantro,\" because it is everywhere!",

I enjoyed the surf/skate motif and found it really visually appealing. I wasn't quite sure what to order, but I ended up with a shrimp soft taco and a Cajun grilled fish enchillada. It totaled just under $7. You basically place your order at the bar and then they give you a number placard and they'll bring it out to you. Self seating.   The restaurant was pretty empty, but it did seem to take awhile for the food to finally come out. It was good, very spicy and flavorful, but not very filling at all. The taco had a LOT of cabbage on it and was really small and difficult to pick up. I gave up trying and just ate it with a knife and fork. The enchillada was pretty good, but again on the small side.  I guess Wahoo's is fine if you are craving Mexican and seafood in a nice atmosphere, but I just felt a little let down. I think I could have had a more satisfying meal elsewhere for the same amount.",

I came in for a takeout order and literally sat there waiting for over 30 minutes. Then I just got home and my order was wrong and they forgot the chips and guacamole I spent extra money on. What a huge disappointment especially after waiting so long for the food. You guys need to pull it together. This is totally unacceptable.",

    "text": "Super stoked to try this place - but   When you walk in this place, it's got a really good vibe, skate gear and logos splattered from wall to wall and has a real open floor plan. The problem is that you aren't sure whether to sit down or find somewhere to place an order. If you walk to the right, you'll find the bar, and this is actually where you place your order - it's quite odd. The menu is pretty clear, and hangs on the wall. Kacie was definitely rude. I asked her what was in draft. She huffed and said \"blah blah blah Sam Adams\" I asked which Sam Adams and she replied with \"Uh...the regular one.\" Service fail, Kacie.  The food was fantastic. I got the fish tacos and the husband got the shrimp tacos, we traded plates after eating one of each so we could share. Holy Moses! They were fantastic! I liked the fish better, but I had the shrimp second, so maybe that's why the tortilla was falling apart so much. It ended up being a big mess in my hand (that's what she said?). The Maui beer battered onion rings were an 'oh wow' situation. Absolutely delicious and came with ketchup and ranch.   We'll absolutely be back for more. They're open until 2am, so a perfect spot for a late-night nosh.   ...hopefully Kacie won't be there.",

I mean, disgusting, public bus station levels of dirty (see my photo). I kept hearing my Gradmama's voice in my head saying \"if the bathrooms are dirty, imagine how dirty the kitchen is,\" something she would always say. Even after I alerted three employees to the dire situation in the toilets (no paper, no hand soap -- GROSS), nobody cared to do anything about it. Because of this, I am not sure I will return because if people aren't washing their hands...well, you know what can happen! Luckily I had my emergency bottle of hand sanitizer in my handbag.  Back to the food: the chips and guacamole were really bad. Don't waste your money paying for either. The shrimp and fish tacos were tasty. Nothing great but a good alternative to steak or chicken. The low carb tacos were served in big lettuce leaves that looked and felt like you were eating a \"real\" taco shell but they were topped with so much cabbage and lettuce \"filler\" that you only got a little spoonful of protein. I left here hungry and disgusted with the lack of cleanliness.",

Twenty minutes in, all my friends had gotten their orders, so I asked a waitress to look into my order. Twenty minutes later, my friends were all finished with their food and ready to leave. I went to inquire again, and they told me my food was just finished. I said my party was leaving already. They asked me to take it to go. I declined, and asked for a refund. It took another 10 minutes to give me my refund.  The last time we were here, we came a bit close to closing time. We asked if it was ok to sit and eat. They assured us it was ok. But soon as we sat down, they started putting the chairs up, and sweeping around us. Basically made it really obvious they were waiting on us.  I really like the food here.

When I went to the register my girlfriend and I ordered the Fast Break burrito. When I was ready to pay it came out higher than I expected. I asked Irany why it was higher than advertised and she argued that's how much it was. My girl friend had to go to the menu up front just to point it out. Irany and her coworker just laughed it off and said that's an old price, her manager would take it down. That got me upset.   When I got my food, the Fast Break Cajun Chicken burrito, It was OKAY.

On the other hand, I'm still not a big fan of their grilled fish tacos that might as well be called \"cabbage tacos.\"  Service at the front counter was a turn off. The lady managing the registers seemed distracted, and one staff member was trying to slyly sip on her Starbucks frap in front of us. On the other hand, other staff members we spoke to were helpful and had better attitudes.

    "text": "In the Summerlin area, Bocca Park is a convenient and great location to shop and dine out. It is always nice to have a new restaurant locate here. This was our first time eating at a Wahoos. We were expecting it to be just your typical fast food type of restaurant but was pleasantly surprised to find out that it is a step up from that.  It has a nice bright lay out with lots of seating. The decor is Southern California beach theme. It has a bar in the middle with an open wall to outside seating. It has a real \"vacation\" type feel to the place. You do order at the counter  but your food is brought out to you at your table. My wife and I had the Cajun Fish Tacos and our daughter had the Cajun Shrimp Taco. The menu only offers the corn tortellia which none of us really like. But if you ask for flour tortilla when you order they do have it. They say the wahoo fish is caught out of the ocean and delivered fresh to the store daily. Our serving size was plenty big enough and all three agreed the tacos were very good. Being able to feed a family of 3 for under $20 in this town is pretty good! The only draw back is they have some excellent outdoor seating but it is considered part of the bar area and anyone under 21 is not allowed to sit out there. It is hard to find a place to take families these days that is a fun place that offers a good economical meal. This place is certainly a great place for families. Too bad they limit the best seating area to adults only.",

    "text": "So my friends had been raving about Wahoo's Fish Taco for a long time so when I heard the new location at Boca was now open I got super excited. I haven't had a decent fish taco anywhere in Vegas and was really looking forward to a great weekend treat. It pains me to say that this was perhaps the worst fish taco, or food in general, I have ever had! The fish was as dry as the desert, along with the taco shells, and the entire combo entree, complete with rice and beans, was essentially flavorless.   The ordering area had a very conveyor belt like feeling, there is no salsa bar so if you are ordering to go, as I was, you will only get hot sauce if you remember to ask. The sauces themselves definitely had heat, but again nothing particularly interesting or memorable in the flavor department.   On the upside, the restaurant itself has a fun, open feel with lots of big screens to watch sports and a great bar and patio. I suspect if you're interested in a neighborhood cerveza hang, you will be pleased, but as for the food I'd have to say stop at the Baja Fresh across the parking lot for a fairly decent fish taco before heading to Wahoo's to meet your amigos.",

The food is just as great as it was then.  The burritos remain my favorites I items. Also the new bajaladas are great. I usually opt for black beans and white rice with extra poco de gallo. $2 Pacificos at happy hour seal the deal. Mmm.",

    "text": "my review is biased as i've been eating at wahoo's since the early 90's. been a fan ever since. it's tough not to be when you're from a socal beach city. wahoo's is pretty much a staple for we beach folk.  i've always loved the laid back, island-aloha-vibe of the place. i love that you can throw stickers on anything...the more, the better. the vegas locations aren't quite as \"stuck-up\" as the cali locations yet, but i'm sure they'll eventually get there. =) it's pretty rad that there's a bar and gaming at the vegas locations.  the food is consistently good, not great. they've always slightly overcooked my fish. i think i'd give them a solid 5 stars if they'd just stop overcooking the fish. i suppose it's not great that they're called wahoo's FISH tacos and the fish is just ok. they should probably work on that.  the onion rings are the bomb tho! my fave.  i'm a super happy socal girl now that wahoo's is in vegas!",

Bottom line,  the fish was dry (I like rubio's fish tacos better) and it wasn't the friendliest atmosphere.  They have a Fuddrucker's-like system but I didn't know and I didn't get the best deal because the cashier was no help at all.  They have video poker for those into that, and a nice open-air feel with a patio to eat on as well.  Cool, but I'd rather go to Kona or Gordon Biersch in Boca to hang out and be hip...",

I would say this place (Rampart location) tasted just like the other chains in California. Now I have no regrets moving out of Cali.",

The classic burrito ($5) is a flour tortilla filled with lettuce, cheese, salsa and the protein of your choice.  I thought the carne asada was nicely flavored.  I've had their burritos served wet with green/red sauce and cheese, which is also a tasty option.  My husband didn't think the shrimp and fish tacos were anything special.  On the night we went, the restaurant was uncomfortably warm, it was actually hotter in the restaurant than outside, and this does not bode well for the summer months!",

I feel like for the size of this place they could use more restrooms. I wanted to wash my hands before eating and there's only 2 private restrooms both occupied so there was a bit of a wait just to use the sink. I ordered the #2 fish taco with the cabbage on top, carne asada enchilada, brown rice, and black beans.  The enchilada has an option of a spicy sauce  on top and they are not joking when they say spicy! It had a good little kick to it. I heard a lot of great things about this place from a few people  and I was finally in the area to check it out. Food was good but I was expecting it to be a little more tasty for all the hype. I wouldn't go out of my way to go back there but If I'm in the area and in the mood I'll probably check it out again.",
