We discovered this GEM about a year ago and have referred so many people here that are from New York City, Queens, Brooklyn, Long Island even up state and the result is always the same, it's delicious. :) We started with a regular slice of pizza, then got hooked on the Grandma for a while, and ventured into the dinners, the Stromboli's are delicious, my favorite is the chicken parmigiana one, we do however like the previous version of the garlic knots, they changed and eh- the other ones were bigger and a lot more flavor-able.  We really enjoyed the baked ziti, the ravioli, spaghetti with garlic and oil, and my husband likes the hero sandwiches and the bread is delicious, so my review is hurry up and go!  The 2 pizza and a drink special is great too.... Oh let's not forget the cannoli I feel like I am in New York all over again. We absolutely adore all the staff, very personable, kind and their main focus is to see that you enjoy what you have ordered.  Try it, you'll love it, and if you don't, try it again because something went wrong....",

I got 2 cheese slices which are thin crust which i thought was cooked to the right texture. Only reason I'm not giving 5 stars is because my slices were a bit on the greasy side. I soaked up 1 1/2 napkins each slice.   Other than that,  great place to grab a quick lunch for a great price ! Definitely fits a college student's budget :)",

It's a little joint that is clearly family owned and simple.   When we walked in, they had this great welcoming attitude. The whole family was friendly and willing to explain the details on how to place an order which was very helpful.   We got done ordering and the food was just incredible! The portions were HUGE for its cheap and affordable price. The ingredients were all fresh and made in house! The flavors blends nicely with each other and the plating was just very simple which is good. I love the fact that they kept the parmesan in the fridge to keep it fresh and they got all the spices on each of the table. After the meal was done they were very courteous and even offered if i wanted to try the garlic knots which were not bad as well.   Another point that i found really great was that they kept their bathroom clean and smelling fresh!   Will definitely go back and try the wood fired pizza next time! Let's support this small local business!",

The pizza is excellent no matter the type, or toppings you decide to throw onto it. The family at Bambinos came from New York, and you can really tell! I'm from New York myself, and even THERE it's hard to match what the owner produces. I've also read some other reviews on here which were completely False! When I mentioned prices being well, I meant it! Someone was claiming that pizza and wings was over 50$ which is outrageous and False! People also said that there are no specials, which is why I ask this one question: Have you even been to this restaurant? There's always specials available for pizza and chicken! I've rambled on enough here folks, now it's up to you to decide, and eat some of this fine food for yourselves. I know one thing, my family and I will be visiting this place weekly from here on! P.S. : Don't always listen to the negatives, especially when there's very little. Some people just get upset because they have nothing better to do but cause waves of negativity. Be open minded, and if you're in the area, YOU be the judge.",

Well, tonight I called them and asked if all of their pizzas were square. No, just the Grandma and 1 other. Ok. May I please order some food for delivery? No, it's too late.  It was exactly 9:12 pm on a Sat night. I said I didn't care how long it took and I was very close. No go. I said that Villa Pizza down the street delivers until 10:30 so he rudely told me to call Villa. With that kind of attitude, I will never order there again! Considering that I spend $100 a week on pizza delivery and tip 35 % or more to the drivers, it's their lost. Never again!",

    "text": "Ever since moving to sin city I've been trying to find a local pizza place with great thin crust pizza and that home town feel. I really thought this would be the place to go after reading other reviews, but I was disappointed.  My boyfriend and I ordered a good old pepperoni pizza and some zucchini sticks for take out. The whole ordering process was pretty easy and the order was ready when we came to pick it up. Then comes the disappointing part.   The pizza was soggy and super greasy. I couldn't even pick a piece up without the toppings falling off and the crust was the only crispy part about it. The zucchini sticks were probable the best part but the sauce was spilled upside down in the bag therefore making it quite messy to eat. You would think they would check the presentation of things before just sending it out to customers.  I guess my search for good local pizza continues.",

The staff here are incredibly friendly and will try to build a rapport with all of their customers, which I personally appreciate! Now the food is phenomenal! I love their buffalo chicken fingers and wings. Their sauce is spicy but not overly so; you can taste the flavor without burning your tastebuds off. They also have a buffalo chicken pizza which is beyond delicious! They also offer several different pizza flavor options as well as different pasta dishes, where you can pick one out of three different pasta noddle options as well as putting a protein in as well. All in all, an amazing place to get some awesome food!",

    "text": "I have been coming to Bambino's for a few years now. USED to be far and away the best place for NY style pizza/italian in LV. Recently, while the service is always fantastic, the quality of the food has gone downhill. The pizza in the display case looks old, and for some reason to counteract this there is now a sign stating at what time the each pizza was made. They are noticeably smaller than they used to be, and taste as though a couple of small corners are being cut to save money. The icing on the cake for me was last week when I ordered a chicken stromboli, which I have probably eaten at least once a week for the past two years. While it arrived and looked huge on the outside, inside there was at most two small strips of chicken. This dish used to be awesome filled to the brim with quality breaded pieces of chicken. However, besides being skimpy, the meat was heavily breaded and just felt much lower quality than in the past. To add insult to injury, the side dish of tomato sauce that was served was ICE cold straight from the refrigerator. This tells me that quality is being overlooked. Now, is it possible that this was just an off night? Of course, but the past few times my family and I have gone in it seems things have taken a small step in the wrong direction, even leading us to walk out a couple of weeks ago. I really really used to love Bambino's and want to remain a loyal visitor. However, it is not hard to tell when something is not quite right with a restaurant and perhaps corners are being cut to make it work. Hopefully whatever has sidetracked these guys can be straightened out quickly to return this place to its former perch atop the pizza pedestal.",

This was my first time eating at Bambino's and I know I'll be back as often as I can. I started with an order of chicken wings (plain) with ranch dressing on the side. They are among the best wings I've ever eaten. I'm not sure what they do to them but they're crunchy on the outside and juicy on the inside -- just the way a wing ought to be. The ranch dressing is made in-house and, again, is some of the best I've had. There's a major difference in taste between homemade and the dressings some places buy in bulk and serve on their salads and with their wings. I also ordered a medium sausage pizza. I know some people think it's a minus when the pizza comes out of the kitchen with that little pool of grease on top and they grab napkins and mop it up. Nope, that's the sign of a tasty pizza! The crust is crispy yet soft enough to fold for that NY method of eating pizza. The toppings are generous and, judging by the taste, seem to be top quality. I took more than half of the pizza home and can tell you that it even tastes good reheated in the oven. I can't wait to go back for more of those wings!",

I love everything about it. When I moved to Las Vegas about 10 months ago, one of my first missions was to find a local pizza place. Well let me tell you... this is NO JOKE or exaggeration.. i ate pizza every day for about 2-3 weeks, trying all different places in the Las Vegas Valley. (Even tried some in California) There is no debate: West Coat just does not make pizza like east coast. All you West Coasters will beg to differ, but that's because you have nothing to compare it to.  Bambino's East Coast Pizzeria is by FAR the best pizza in Las Vegas. Those who claim the pizza is \"too greasy\" obviously have never eaten at an authentic pizza joint on the east coast. I actually found it funny when people comment about the grease.. that's actually how i knew i needed to try this place!  The pizza was perfect.. sooooo cheesy it just ooozed and would come out in long strings whenever i bit into it! man i havent found anywhere in vegas like this yet!  Trust an opinion from me, an Italian chef's daughter who grew up in Boston for 27 years.. this is THE ONLY PLACE TO GO FOR PIZZA IF YOU ARE FROM THE EAST COAST",

I added Sausage & Pepperoni for an additional $1 ($.50 per topping).  The joint is decked out in Boston photos and memorabilia.....be prepared to get a talking to if you walk in here with other sports teams gear.  A guy with a Lakers hat was catching some guff from the owner.  It was all in good fun and they were both having fun talking a bit of trash about the other team.  Hilarious.  After a few minutes my Pizza came out.  It's a thin Crust variety, very similar to NY Style.  I'm not calling it NY Style because it's a Boston Pizza joint.  The slices are pretty big and you have to fold it if you want to eat it with your hands.....I like it better that way.  The Pizza was pretty good....above average.  I thought the Sausage was much better than the Pepperoni.  The Pepperoni wasn't anything special.  The Cheese was gooey and had good flavor.  I didn't have to add anything to the Pizza, I enjoyed it as is.  Overall, It's a pretty good Pizza.  If I could, I'd give it 3.75 Stars, but I'm rounding up here.  Return Factor - 60%....would be higher if I lived nearby.",

    "text": "My cousin and I came to Bambinos after a strenuous hike out at Red Rock. We worked up a serious appetite and yelped the yummiest mom and pop pizza joint near us. Bambinos caught our eye so we set out for our highly anticipated pie. It was easy to find tucked into a shopping strip of sorts. We were greeted immediately and handed menus at the counter that you order at. We decided on a Cesar salad and a large grandmas pie. We sat down and the waitress brought markers out for my daughter. As a momma, I always appreciate kind gestures like these.   Our small Cesar salad came out quickly and we were both happy with the size of it. (A small is large enough for two people to split) They brought out a  warm loaf of French bread shortly after. I indulged and grabbed a bottle of olive oil from the condiment/ utensil hutch and made a nice mixture of olive oil, Parmesan cheese, salt, pepper, and red pepper flakes. We dipped our warm French bread in the olive oil and it was heavenly.  **What? We earned it on our hike, remember??? **  As we were finishing off our salad, the pie came out! Perfect timing! The crust was the perfect combination of crunchy yet doughey. With each bite there was crispy crunch, but you still have to pull a bit to tear the bread. (This is my favorite type of crust y'all) The cheese used for this pizza HAS to be some kind of specialty or imported cheese because it was so tasty. Lastly the sauce. A pizza is nothing with out sauce and I'll be the first to say their sauce was magnificent.   Needless to say, We ate way to much. What we had left over we decided to bring to my husbands office so that  we could share the deliciousness we had just experienced. (It would have been horribly selfish to have kept it all for myself- although I deeply considered it.)   Walking through his office felt like the cha cha train you'd do at a wedding. With every turn we had more of my husbands colleagues behind us following the incredible aroma of the pizza. By the time I got to my husbands office- most of his co workers were popping in asking where the pizza came from! Don't worry, I encouraged him to share.   The ONLY thing I saw that I didn't LOVE, was the table next to us ordered a big beautiful pepperoni pizza. When it came out I was drooling over the smell. I personally don't eat meat so that should tell YOU something. The gentleman that ordered the pie called over my attention as he preformed an almost professional cheese pull. It was glorious. BUT than came the grease. SO MUCH GREASE. There was a puddle under the slice. That was concerning but I asked him how it tasted? He raved about how yummy his slice was while the rest of his table continued to moan with each bite. So I made the assumption that the grease didn't effect the integrity of the crust.   Anyways- we can't wait to go back. Would love to see an arugula option for on top of the grandma pie!  It was absolutely delicious. We had a great time, wonderful service, quality ingredients, and speedy service. Great mom and pop joint!",

Located on the west side of Vegas it's a short drive to the small but popular eatery.  I called my order in and advised them when I would be arriving.  Once arriving and not having any issue parking, we wewre seared at a table by the friendly male employees and started us with the half order of antipasto salad and put white pizza in the oven. The salad was large and had the whole kitchen of ingredients that made the salad outstanding . Timing was perfect of receiving the pizza which was rich tasting and delicious.   I definitely was satisfied and got my white pizza fix at Bambino's!",

They had a special, a large cheese pizza (you can add toppings) and 10 wings for $20. We got that and some garlic knots for $3. The prices are great and you get a lot of food. There was four of us and still took home 4 slices. The wings were bomb had just the right amount of crisp the garlic knots were really good too. The pizza was also really good not over cooked or anything and just the right amount of crust. The ranch was the good ranch so that was a plus. Would definitely recommend and will be returning.",

I didn't hold out much hope since we've been let down a few times.  The gentlemen that picked up said it would take 25 minutes,  \"no problem\" I said.  This place had maybe 7 tables inside & two Televisions. There was 10 people total sitting in the dining area. A couple,  table of 4, two guys & another pick up order.   Staff was busy serving pizzas left & right.  I watched as they served the tables & it smelled anazing.  Our order want ready for another 8 minutes which I'm cool with as long as it's good pizza. Total came to $18.12.  The ride home seemed like forever & when we got home all 3 of us said it was the best greasy pizza ever out here.  Being from Rhode Island we all miss the pizza, this hit the spot.  We'll be back since we know all demolished this order.  I normally post pictures but I didn't have a chance.",

    "text": "This was a solid A-OK experience.   My man friend's poppa was in town and is a big fan of Sicilian style pizza. Heard great things via many of my Yelp friend's reviews about this place so I made the drive across town. Don't let my 3-stars fool you into thinking this wasn't a good experience. It was good, just not great.   They were super busy at the counter when I walked in so I snagged a table in the back corner near the window. The young gentleman taking our order was new and a bit nervous. We ordered the Sicilian and added pepperoni as well as the Antipasto salad. The poor kid seemed really unsure when he walked away with our order. Our salad came and it was pretty tasty. Loaded with meats, cheeses, and olives - it was plenty for three of us to share as a starter. We opted for the Italian dressing and I was a fan. Next thing you know a large round pepperoni pizza shows up at our table. It looked delicious but it's not what we ordered.  Unfortunately, he thought we had ordered two pizzas. One large pepperoni and one Sicilian as is. I watched with sadness as the pepperoni pizza was taken back to the kitchen. Another gal came over to verify that we only wanted one pizza - Sicilian with pepperoni - and to apologize because the other employee was new. It was an honest mistake and it was all fine. The Sicilian pizza came out soon after and the crust was perfectly crispy and buttery. Super cheesy and the sauce was quite good. Not as sweet as other Sicilian style pizzas I've had, but a solid 4-stars.Unfortunately, the pepperoni was added last minute due to the ordering snafu so it wasn't crispy at all, but that's okay!  I will definitely be visiting this place again because the staff was super nice and the food was great. They did start closing 30 minutes early so I felt a bit rushed to get out once they started putting the chairs on the tables but the experience overall was very pleasant. I mean, it's pizza! And pizza is always a good time.",

    "text": "Ok so for years I've watched this location change from one pizza shop to the next.... some owned by middle easterners ... some by nice family from the Midwest and now a New York settlement has planted their roots at this spot and I couldn't be any happier.   Ok so my go to is their cheese pizza. The amount of cheese is out of bounds , the dough of the pizza is perfect it's just a great pie.   I've had their supreme and wasn't thrilled it was over burden with sauteed veggies that weighed the pizza down and made it soggy so I basically couldn't eat it. I for and knifed it and I love love love veggies and I'd love for this place to make a pizza with just fresh toppings nothing cooked all ready because I like my veggies a bit al Dente.   Regardless of that supreme pie flop it was will tasty.   Well today I got my daughter and her friends a large cheese pie as this is their new fav pizza and I see this slice and it looks so inviting and hearty and I say hey what's that the nice lady with the shirt brunette hair replies \"Lasagna pizza\" I immediately go I want one now  I love lasagna so how could this be bad right??  Right ! It was amazing the velvety ricotta that blanked out the salty lasagna meats and sauce that was just folded perfectly over this dough I was in heaven I took one bite and said omg I have to text this to someone and showed friends and now here I am writing a review while finishing this pizza slice of life !   I think people love this place because of the amount of toppings but I suggest you make two pizza options light or heavy ! Have two price brackets and those who want heavy on the toppings can pay heavy prices and hose who like a nice balance can pay a bit less.   Just my opinion. Anyhow this is Jen of my top 3 fav pizza spots in Las Vegas.   The people are spectacular. I will say before there were some young ladies one with short blonde hair the other I've cast out of my memory and no matter how many hi's or pleasantries I sent to them they were never receptive , pleasant or responsive. Their customer service was horrid but now I see two older ladies as the other two probably early 18-22 well these two new ladies are heaven !   They are so sweet pleasant and kind. It makes all the difference it balances out the smart ass ways of the men in the kitchen and I'm sure those ladies can hold their own but what they give out to the world and their customers is genuine kindness and consideration and I appreciate it and thank them! Very tip worthy those two I'll have to find out their names !   Anyhow can't wait to see what I try next as I'm eager to venture into their pastas since this lasagna pizza has that traditional authentic lasagna flavor you want to taste. No spins ... no twists ... just traditional lasagna flavors on a pizza. A lovely meat sauce , cheeses and doses of ricotta on top.  So wondrous everyone should try it $4 a slice and I'm so full I can't breathe !  Oh and as to the Authenticity of this being a True New York Pizza I can't say because I am not a native of New York but I can say by my encounters with their clients I would say it is Def an authentic NYC style pizza !   Enjoy you won't be sorry",

They also had televisions playing college football, which made the experience even better.  The only this that could have made this experience top notch? If they served beer.

We had the mussels and chicken wings ( for the girls) as appetizers. The mussels were perfectly cooked, not tough or chewy. Plus the portion was very large for the price. If you ordered this dish on the strip, you would easily pay triple the amount at least. Ask for extra bread to mop up the amazing sauce that's on the mussels. The flavor is unbelievable. The chicken wings were very flavorful too. We also had chicken parmigiana, baked ziti, chicken francese, and a pizza. All very delicious and again ample portions. You will bring home leftovers. Try this place. You won't be disappointed. On a side note, my parents have been back several times since the Mothers's Day visit and my mother really likes one of the desserts, the Italian cheesecake. They went on a Sunday and they were out. My mother told the owner that they were coming back to eat there for their anniversary ( which was just a few days away) he told her he would have it for her. When they returned a few days later, he was True to his word and had the Italian cheesecake for her. Very nice family run restaurant.",

We were going back and forth and having a good time, my kids enjoyed it.  We got 4 slices of plain, $2/slice isn't terrible pretty standard. I loved it. Thin crust with a nice crisp and you can fold it in half and just chow on down! My kids split a chicken bomb sub, was delicious! Like a chicken cheese steak almost! The service was ok, the other people that work there besides the owner just don't seem to be into it as much. Understandable. Love the place though and wish them all the luck! Keep it up!",

Overall I was very satisfied with the food -- it was very reasonably priced and most importantly, really good!! Here's what we got:  Garlic Knots ($3) - 6 jumbo buttery garlic knots almost the size of my fist (though I do have kind of small hands, hehe) with lots of marinara sauce - YUM!!!  Chicken Wings ($6) - 10 large breaded chicken wings tossed in your choice of sauce.  These were awesome and at only $6 for 10 wings, a nice deal!  16\" Large Meatball Pizza ($13.50) - This is a BIG pizza for a pretty good price; great sauce, crust, cheese... definitely skimpy on the toppings though; I would've expected double the amount of meatballs :(  Despite the lack of pizza toppings, I'd totally go back here because the food was great and you definitely get a LOT of it for your money.  Service was good too and as someone from New England, it was nice to hear the Boston accent :) I look forward to going back!",

My husband orders the garlic knots all the time and they are so good! . We have dealt with a lot of pizza places here in Vegas and this one is definitely one of our favorites. They are so nice too. I have also ordered the meatball parmesan sub over a dozen times. It is so delicious! One of my favorites at Bambino's. After reading these reviews now I am dying to try their calzones! I hope this place never goes out of business. We just love it. The pasta dinners are only $7 bucks, where can you get that anywhere else???? I'm so sick of these pizza places that charge you $13 bucks for spaghetti and meatballs.Really????  Thank You Bambinos for the great value for the dollar! You guys are awesome!!!!!!!",

Arrived after 17 minute because I walked there and got there earlier. It was sitting in a box on their cool rack so I was confused but continued home.   My friends and I all too a slice realizing it was extremely greasy.  I know with peporoni it's gonna be greasy but hot oil was getting all over our hands it was really gross. I bit into the pizza and it was just doughy. Not fully cooked.   I called them to see what they can do to fix it. Since I had 5 friends over and we each took a slice they wouldn't just get me a new one next time or refund my order. I used to come here a lot. But unfortunate this was the last straw came, spent 20 dollars for semi raw dough with cheese and oil.   Oh and when he was asking whoever what to do, you should press the hold/ mute button. I heard him. Also when you put me on hold, I again heard the entire order you took. But whatever, I guess.",

They are generous with their toppings, and while I've never dined in, I always appreciate how they offer to carry my pizza to the car for me when I have my kids with me.  The garlic knots are top notch - not overly garlicky so that vampires run for the hills.    It's not national chain cheap, but it's comparable to any mom-and-pop pizza joint. Quality food and quality people. I'd over pay for that any day.",

Wish I had stopped in sooner instead of driving by thinking another place with ny or easy coast on it trying to be. Well worth the drive and when your three teenagers say it's just as good from a visit to ny then it's got to be. A must try",

Other patrons who ordered after us received their orders before us. When one of the waitresses inquired as to why we were still waiting, I told her we were waiting on a pizza. There was some commotion in the kitchen and our pizza came out maybe 10 minutes later. No acknowledgment from the owner and no apology. Our bill was 42.00 without tip. We will be sure to tell our family about this and all of our acquaintances. We won't be back and no one seemed to care except for the lovely lady who lead us out the door. I guess they don't need or appreciate our business.  Our money will be better spent elsewhere.",

From the amount of sauce, to the amount of toppings, to even the very taste of the food itself. But my order today was the worst by far. My coworkers and I ordered a large order for delivery and the tomato sauce was INEDIBLE. This wasn't just a taste preference (ie, bland, too much oregano) but it actually tasted like something was off or it had turned. We called to let them know, the girl put me on hold, and when she returned she said \" I spoke with the owner, and he said there's nothing I can do for you and that's just how the sauce tastes.\" First off we weren't looking for any freebies and we just wanted to let them know because it was truly inedible. Two of us regularly order from them and the sauce has NEVER tasted like this. To disregard a customers concern with out even checking the quality of the food your are serving is unacceptable. Sad that a place with so much promise isn't taking pride in the consistency of the food they serve.",

I'm a big fan of Metro and Rocco's for their NY style, but this is as authentic NY as you'll get.    I wanna thank Metro's for their years of service to my stomach, but I found a new spot now.  Their tomato sauce is so good.  It's not too acidic but just enough to remind you that you're having tomatoes, not apples.  The mozzarella was rich so you got that famous string that stretches when you bite into it.  Don't think it's just \"heat\" that does that.  It's also the ingredients in it.    On the way out, they even gave me a slice (on the house) of this round deep dish pizza.  I was thrown off.  I never ate a deep dish back in NY.  When I bit into it, it wasn't dense like these Chicago pizzas.  It had the fluffiness that a Sicilian slice has.  I friggin' loved it and can't wait to thank them when I return.    If you're also yearning for that NY slice and have also been asleep on this gem, go now.",

We've been driving by Bambino's for several months and finally decided to stop for dinner this last Friday. It reminded us of little joints from the \"NY neighborhood \" where my husband grew up. The Caesar salad was excellent and a nice start to the meal. We ordered the meat lovers pizza and it's a hit. The crust was tasty and nicely crispy but still had a good chew. We finished with the house special cannoli that was a perfect finish. The service is spot on and I loved having the owner and her parents in the dining room and kitchen. We love supporting local businesses and recommend you give them a try.",

Quite simply, it was the best pie I have experienced in over 20 years in Las Vegas. It had body, the crust had the perfect char, an equally perfect amount of cheese and the sauce was that perfect mix of gentle sweetness and tang. Everybody claims they make NY pizza, so it is no small task trying to find one that is actually credible to reach that lofty goal. Rest assured, this is it... no need to look elsewhere. I will be back regularly. Also the young lady at the counter was perfectly pleasant. A win/win for everyone.",

I had no idea, though just how great this would be!!  So impressed with the nice servers that were very attentive and had patience with us since my 15-month-old was trying to destroy/eat everything they brought to our table!  We had the special for $19....a HUGE CHEESE PIZZA with 10 crispy and very flavorful wings.  Also had another special for our party and had pepperoni & jalapenos put on.  AMAAAAAZING!!!!  The mozzarella they use has the best flavor and texture.....and wow the sauce!!!!  Pizzas are wood-fired so the crust is a bubbly, crispy perfection that I always look for.  They have Italian seasonings right at the table to up the flavor even more so......we could not have enjoyed it any more and I will be back over and over again!!!!  Yum!!!  :)",

    "text": "Bambinos - New York heroes fighting fires and retiring in Las Vegas opened a New York style wood oven pizzeria in Las Vegas named Bambinos on Durango and Sahara next to Stephanie's spa. I will tell you more about Stephanie; but you have to try this authentic cheesy, tasty pizza.  Each slice is fantastic. I ordered two slices with NYFD Firefighters Mike Tomko preparing everyone for the September 11 Tribute next week along Fremont Street and ended up buying a large pie with their special red sauce to take home for my kid's dinner. I don't think he ever had pizza this good in his life. The chef does something special with wood, filtered water, and pizza dough, the fire fighters tell the story best. The lunch crowd came in large numbers with moms ordering up to three large pizza pies. As I said, I took one home unexpectedly. Groups came in and took up tables. Delicious, absolutely delicious slice of New York. Follow the NYFD in Las Vegas to taste wood stove baked pizza in Summerlin, Las Vegas, Nevada. Lunch specials : Two cheese slices with a soda for lunch $5.00.",

VERY EASY ON THE EYES.  The pizza was great , for 5 bucks we got 2 unbelievably huge slices and a 16 oz.fountain drink.

My daughter thinking that she cooked the pizza looks at me and goes \"Mommy that girl bakes a good pizza\"..lol. I believe I read that they do a lunch time pizza special with two slices and a soda and that seemed to be a huge hit. It was a chill place and I thought it was cute the older couples coming in for the special and chatting with the staff. You could tell they were regulars and the staff interaction was just cute. Would definitely recommend it really did remind me of back East!",

My cheese/pepperoni was tasty= sauce, cheese, crust, etc. My wonderful Yelp friend, Lisa G graciously offered me some of her vegetarian pizza and I was in heaven!

    "text": "Amazing pizza! Honestly, how is it that we've never been to Bambino's pizza?! We were craving pizza on a Monday night and decided to check out Bambino's after a friend recommended going there and verifying good reviews on Yelp.  We arrived an hour before closing but the owner and staff were so welcoming, and we knew it would be good since it was still fairly busy.  As per Yelp reviews, we decided to try the white pizza (usually my favorite), 'grandma's pizza, garlic knots and the cannoli.  The garlic knots came first: piping hot, crunchy on the outside and chewy soft inside. Make sure to dip it in the extra garlic butter sauce in the bottom of the plate and the sauce that comes with it. Then comes the white pizza: amazing flavor, simple white pizza yet complex and delicious in flavor! White pizza is usually my favorite order, but from the other Yelp reviews, we also decided to order 'grandma's pizza. WOW. Everyone is right. You HAVE to try it. Simple yet savory, slightly sweet sauce, perfect blend of cheese. Then comes the cannoli. I'll be honest, my hubby loves cannoli but it's usually not my favorite. This was the BEST cannoli I've had (and I've even eaten them while in New York!). Not only was the food delicious, the staff and people were fantastic! Such wonderful characters (most of the 'regulars' we met were from Staton Island, Long Island, etc). We were saying this place needs to be on Food Network-it was that good! We will certainly be returning again soon (someone recommended the lasagna pie) and will be recommending this new favorite to our family and friends!",

    "text": "* Customer service: 4/5 These guys are very nice, greeted us upon arrival, didn't charge us for last minute extra sauce and offered to serve the garlic knots before receiving our to-go pizza.  * Cleanliness: 5/5 The restaurant was VERY CLEAN. Both the kitchen and tables were spotless.  * Food and portion size: 4/5 We ordered a large half pepperoni and half Hawaiian with extra sauce. The pizza hardly had any sauce, cheese was average, but wasn't greasy and the crust was GREAT (cooked in a brick oven, fresh taste, not too thin and not too thick). But the pepperoni portion was VERY SALTY. I am assuming it was salty because of the pepperoni because the Hawaiian was PERFECT.   As for the garlic knots, they were GREAT! Nice soft bread with just the right amount of garlic and butter. The marinara sauce used for dipping was excellent (very fresh and tasted original).   Portion sizes were perfect for two-four people.  * Atmosphere, room capacity, and menu size: 4/5 Restaurant is conveniently located next to a 7/11 in the newer looking plaza. The interior is up-to-date and casual. It's a good size restaurant with a simple menu.  * Price: 5/5 Price was perfect for a large with four toppings ($16.00).   * Recommend or return? I would definitely recommend this place and return, I LOVE the fact that they use a brick oven! The only reason I gave an overall 4/5 is because how salty the pepperoni pizza was. But maybe it was just that time and day...",

    "text": "Solid Italian restaurant with no frills amazing food.  I had the baked clams with herbed bread crumbs, sauteed spinach, chicken francese, fettuccine alfredo, and cannoli.  The baked clams were tender, not over cooked, with their clam juice, and the herbed bread crumbs complimented the clams nicely, just a squeeze of lemon made it on point.  The sauteed spinach was chopped and cooked soft with burnt garlic, if you are a garlic fan you would enjoy this dish.  The Chicken francese dish had tender chicken with a bright acidic white wine sauce and spaghetti, I have an affinity for acidity and this dish more than satisfied my pH-of-less-than-7 palette.  Solid, solid fettuccine alfredo and they have a strong, like Mr. Olympia-strong, cannoli game.  I will end my review with a quote from Scorpion from Mortal Kombat...\"GET OVER HERE!\"",

We kinda took over the place and were a little loud, but that's because we were having such a good time and stuffing our faces on what turned out to be great food.  Since we all ordered what we wanted but ended up sharing, there was a big assortment of items to try.    Three friend and I shared a white pizza, which was scrumptious, and a large salad that, thankfully, was romaine and not iceberg, which had a very good ranch dressing that we had on the side.  There were other dressings to choose from.  We also got to sample the garlic knots, veggie pizza, and the calzone.  Everything was terrific, but the calzone was extra wonderful!    What I love most about Bambino's pizza is that the crust is not overly salty; so many other pizza joints drown their crusts in salt.  This one was perfect, and crispy, just the way I love it.  The white pizza had just the right amount of chopped garlic, creamy ricotta, and extra seasonings that bumped it up several notches in flavor.  Great service, too, from a family-owned establishment that I hope will be around for a long time.",

I can eat a whole pizza here and ten wings, I encourage you to bring a friend though :) chefs are right around the corner so you can peek in on the magic, and the fries lace has windows on two walls so you don't feel claustrophobic!

I've seen rumors of new management, not sure if it's True or not but our pizza was just alright this time (it's been awhile since we've eaten here) We ordered a medium pepperoni pizza that was $15. I'm fine with paying prices for great quality food worth it but our pizza was very very greasy and almost soggy like. The grease was literally dripping down our hands onto our forearms,For that price we expected better. And the stomach ache that came along because of that wasn't fun.   Customer service is always great and the young woman who took our order over phone was very sweet and professional, along with all the staff when you walk in, but I didn't like that they don't let customers know about their daily deals. As we walked up to pick up our pizza they had a chalk board sign with their deal of the day that included one LARGE pizza and wings for $19.99 we would've just opted for that had we known so that was pretty annoying being that we spent $15 for half of that Maybe it's our fault for not asking but as a business why not let your customer know? Especially because we would've got more bang for our buck.   Regardless we didn't like how greasy and soggy it was. We've gotten the chicken fingers before as well and those are really good. Not sure if we'll be back anytime soon though.",

Too bad we decided to actually read the reviews after biting into the first slice and realizing Ol Bambino stuck it to us. Now, I guess we wait for the upset stomach to follow... Good Luck to all eat here! We are trashing the rest of the pizza = $60. We are not going to argue with disrespectful sub-par pizza makers/cashiers.   Attention Owner: Call DiGiorno (may have seen their commercial on tv) and ask if they can provide some insight. I understand they specialize in frozen pizzas, but as of now, they have you beat in quality and flavor. Your restaurant could use any/all help it could get. Really.",

Rosie took care of us and our friends loved everything, especially, the mozzarella sticks (my personal favorite). We had pizza, chicken parm with spaghetti, antipasto salad, garden salad, garlic  knots, and of course, mozzarella sticks.  It's just not about the great food, it's about the familial and warm feeling when entering the door. It's about knowing our names and our stories. Finally, it's about supporting our local businesses. Thank you everyone at Bambinos for showing our out of town friends a wonderful experience!  Jan and Dan",

Good ingredients not to greasy thin crust the way it should be like back east. Just a touch of crispyness. I would give it five but my only complaint was the ingredients wanted to slide off. Now that is not a complaint because they were not cheap when it came to toppings. Probably had a touch to much sauce but the sauce was tasty n I am not a big pizza sauce guy. Good work guys and I'll be back. N if you haven't tried it support your local joints and try it. U won't be disappointed.",

But wait... didn't even get to the best part... they have sicilian pies! And they sell it by the slice as well. My new favorite sicilian in Vegas... also convenient that I can see the slices from the window as I pull up to see if they have sicilian lol... yes.. i'm that lazy.  Anyway... give this place a shot and support local pizza places! So far everything I have had has been good and very fair priced. The staff is very friendly and the family that owns it recently moved to Vegas from Long Island.   Looking forward to many more sicilian slices... now off to reheat one that's in my fridge :)",

The place is family owned and operated and I love supporting local places like this and I would highly recommend you, (the reader of this review), to do the same.",

Let's try that!  Pizza - \"My incredibly tasty crust and fresh toppings are crafted with love by my family that came from Long Island, NY. I'm priced well, and you can have me any way you like. Eat me, now\".   That does it for me. It looks, smells, feels, and tastes like an East Coast gem in the middle of the desert. Get here for their lunch specials and come back for the hospitality.",

The pizza wasn't bad at all, but the sauce needed a little extra something. For a True a New Yorker to say pizza is pretty good you know you've got something going for you. The salad was great! You can definitely tell it was made fresh and with care! Every ingredient was delicately sliced and perfectly placed...and the house Italian dressing - WoW! Ok so the chicken parm actually hit home to me because I can truly say it tastes like Grandma used to make! The way it was breaded and fried just reminds me of Sunday dinners as a kid back in Queens. The cheese on top was very good, as well  definitely not a cheaper cheese. The place is so cute inside, too! They had the game playing above a very cozy atmosphere, and everyone was so nice. It all just fit. Don't get this place confused with another spot that has a similar name. I would definitely recommend giving it a try.",

The cheese.. not sure if it was the delivery guys fault for taking too long or the way it was made, but you grab a slice of bread and sauce and dive in! The cheese isn't staying on this pizza more than a second.   The flavor was good, wish I would've been able to enjoy the entire slice of pizza though.   It's only a 2 because of the flavor. Probably won't be ordering from here again.",

From the moment we entered the place was a failure, we were not greeted properly, confusing entry you literally don't know what to do. Server wasn't train properly did a horrible job, the food quality was the WORSE ( all food tasted like it was frozen) didn't give appetizers at the same time and one of entree's was late too!!! They took forever to cook while the restaurant pretty much was empty and you can clearly see at least 4 staff members in the kitchen area. Also they had the fan at max which made our food cold in 5 mins. I DON'T RECOMMEND THIS RESTAURANT!!! OVER PRICED for the quality, I mean I wouldn't even want it FREE.

The pizza slices were super tasty and they have a special where you get 2 slices & a drink pretty darn cheap. The first time I went, I got pepperoni & black olives. The second time, I got just cheese. Both times, the slices were perfect.   It's honestly the closest I've found in Vegas to NYC style slices with tasty crust and good cheese.

Bambinos which is conveniently located near my place of employment really shined when I went to lunch and had a slice. The pizza crust was crispy and golden, the cheese was stringy and delicious and it produced just the right amount of oil when doing the original NY pizza fold. Of Corse its not exactly NY pizza because this is Las Vegas but its one of the best I have tried here and I am a constant returning customer. You may notice the 4 star rating rather than 5, this is not due to the quality of their food its actually referring to their customer service. How I am treated when I go somewhere is important and adds to the whole dining experience. I have been to Bambinos several times and every time I am there I am not greeted by any employee, the individuals standing behind the counter all look kind of miserable and unhappy and don't seem to really interact with their clientele. That being a little disappointing, it still does not steer me away from that heavenly slice of pizza. It is a must try, just don't be surprised if the employees don't really engage with you. Great food just not one of those old style family pizza places that makes you feel at home.",

Let me just say, the Meat Lovers pizza from Bambino's blew our minds and we ate THE WHOLE THING in under 10 minutes.  10 minutes!!!!  I don't think we even stopped to take a breath between bites because it was so tasty!  We inhaled the awesome pizza because it was simply amazing.  It had flavorful pepperoni, ham, and some of the best sausage I have ever had, EVER!  We also tried some yummy garlic knots, cheese sticks, chicken fingers (yes, I steal my baby girl's chicken fingers when she isn't looking), and fries. Oh and the zeppoles!  I have never had a zeppole and didn't know what to expect.  They are Italian style donuts and are one of the best things I have ever eaten dessert-wise.  They were hot fried dough, covered in powdered sugar and other fun spices and were finger licking good!  Everything we tried was delicious, came in a huge serving, and at a very good price.  How can you go wrong?  It is a small joint, but it feels super homey.  The staff was always coming out to talk to us and make sure we were happy.  There was a lovely young lady, Stephanie, who was awesome!  I think she was about 13 and was on top of everyone in the restaurant.  She was running the counter and taking food orders, as well as being the welcoming committee.  She would even come out to play with my daughter from time to time, just to make sure she was enjoying lunch too!   It is a great mom & pop place and you feel so welcomed just walking in the door.  I wish Vegas had more places like this one!  Every bite I took in Bambino's was delightful and I will be back for more!",

The mozzarella sticks were good, our food had no taste and the chicken was way over cooked.  me my wife and daughter didn't even finish our meals waiter took them away and we didn't get compensated for any part of it.   They seamed more interested in making pizzas for people because those were going in and out all over the place but sitting down for a chicken marsala meal which tasted like it was made with water just stunk I'll never go back    And the wait for dining in the restaurant, we just about left - we waited about 45 min for junk. And the size of their cups for sodas I'm not in kindergarten I want an adult size cup....",

    "text": "The entire pizza experience is determined by what manner you choose to eat your pizza.  A lively topic of conversation ensued on our UYE about proper technique.  Turns out Loren F. and I are the fork and knife users.  Antonio preferred the folded pizza and eating it by hand technique.  Seems the rest of the table preferred the pick it up and eat it without folding it technique.   There's nothing better to go with pizza than good company.  Michele H. was kind enough to prepare a large table for our group complete with appetizers and a little table for the kiddos to work on their coloring projects.  To the pizza itself, I ordered two slices of the vegetarian.  I posted those pictures for your review.  I believe I am correct in that this would be equivalent to four pieces of pizza anywhere else.  I was very happy with the taste of my pizza, the ratio of sauce to veggies was just right and the individual tastes of the vegetables really popped in my mouth.  I couldn't finish my two slices so I ended up sharing it with Loren F. and Skyler and LJ.    As far as the atmosphere goes, it was like a cute side street pizzeria you might expect to find in \"Bowston\".  I appreciated the themed pictures, jerseys, Red Sox paraphanelia.  I don't get the large Citgo sign next to the drink machine, seems to detract from the rest of the memorabilia.    I did look over at Marie T. dabbing the grease off the pepperoni and cheese.  That was a big negative to me.  From what I have been taught, the better meats and cheeses don't pool grease on the top of the pizza when cooked so that was a negative to me. That's the reason for my rating.  All in all, though I think everyone enjoyed their meal and the fried dough was very popular.  I decided to stay away from the garlic knots, fried dough but did indulge in a few fries.  The service was very attentive and I believe we were all happy about that.  I'd say this is a great place to bring kids or a small group for some thin crust pizza.",

I was acknowledged immediately and given a cup for my drink while waiting on my pizza.  I got my 2 slices of pepperoni pizza pretty quickly. It was fresh, hot, and tasted fantastic. The staff immediately asked how my pizza was after my first few bites.   I didn't have any issues with my food, but if I did, I feel very confidently that they would have taken care of my problem right away. They do an excellent job and they make it look very easy.  I will definitely be returning there for lunch in the future.",

    "text": "Came here for a UYE put together by Michele H. I have to admit this was a little far for me, but I don't mind driving for the good food and even better company. I drove by this place numerous times when I lived on this side of town. Now I regret passing it because I missed out on some delish pizza.   Upon waking in, it's a cute little place with about 10 tables. It's clean and the walls are decorated with numerous sports teams memorabilia. Michele and a few other yelpers already had a few tables put together for the event with some appetizers on the table for us to try. There were fries, mozzerella sticks and garlic knots. We arrived an hour later so they were already cold. I did try the garlic knots. Good buttery garlicky flavor. I imagine these would be fantastic if they were hot and fresh.   I ordered the #1 lunch combo which came with 2 slices of cheese pizza and a drink for $5. It was 50 cents per additional topping so I added pepperoni and garlic. My friend had the #2 lunch combo which came with one slice of cheese pizza, a salad and a drink for $6. He opted for his pizza as Hawaiian which was $1 extra I believe. Our food was delish!! The salad was bright, colorful and fresh. Nice crunch to the lettuce and the Italian dressing was just perfect. The pizza was also delish!!! Thin crust NY style, which I'm not a huge fan of, but this was amazing. My 2 slices of garlic/pepperoni were huge! It was greasy so I had to tab some of it off with a napkin. No biggie. I loved how they chopped up the garlic and spread it throughout the 2 slices instead of huge chunks here and there. And there was plenty of pepperoni on there as well. I'm not a huge fan of Hawaiian but my date said it was yummy. Lisa G. ordered the vegetarian pizza which looked yummy as well. Colorful and packed with veggies. I would have tried it if I wasn't so full.   Towards the end, the owners brought us fried dough covered in butter and powdered sugar. I pretty much ate the entire basket and had to move them away from me. Loren and I did have a mild choking incident when we both inhaled the powdered sugar on accident. Good times. The owners were very friendly and were very easygoing. They made sure everyone was fully stocked and had everything they needed. Great event with awesome food and awesome people. Thanks Michele H!",

Only reason I didn't go 5 stars is that pepperoni is just a tad too greasy. But the meatball pizza was just perfect! Ordered their baked ziti one night when it was just me and that was very tasty as well. Will miss Bambino's when I move from Vegas this month.",

It is the first place that I have been to in Las Vegas, that matches what I always had in NY.  My husband ordered the seafood pescatore.

The powdered sugar that covered them was an added bonus for her! lol....... the cannolis were really good with the perfect balance as well.

I have tried quite a few items and enjoyed all of them. They sell pizza by the slice, sicilian and grandma pizza by the slice.  They also have woodfired pizza, calzones, rice balls, pinwheels just to name a few. Tonight I ordered a pizza with grilled chicken, roasted peppers, plum tomatoes, roasted garlic, fresh mozzarella it was awesome.  You have to try this place, you will not be disappointed, trust me i know NY pizza, i was born and raised in NY.",

They use quality cheese, they take it out of that big brick oven and you can't even wait for it to cool down. I happily live with blisters on the roof of my mouth for this pie!! I pick it up to-go and shamelessly eat a slice before I even make it home! Their garlic knots are little bits of heaven when you dip, no no no, when you DUNK them into their house sauce, which I will admit, I do actually drink it straight from the cup. I have faith in humanity when I eat those things. Everything these guys make is spot on, and I just can't get enough!! Not to mention, every single one who works there, I want to be best friends with. Or at least they make me feel like I already am the moment I walk through the door. I love these guys! I will forever be faithful to Bambino's and YOU SHOULD BE TOO!! (Believe it or not I was always a girl who swore she \"wasn't a pizza girl.\" PSHH has that changed! THANKS BAMBINO'S)",

    "text": "I am a new transplant to Vegas. Since my move here in November, in the Summerlin/Spring Valley area, I have NOT found a pizza place that was actually good. This sentiment is shared by my husband who is from New York. And I'm not much of a food snob, pizza generally makes me happy. But....i had yet to eat pizza that has enough crunch throughout the crust, good sauce, and lots of oily cheese. Many pizzas I have tried have a tinny taste or used frozen ingredients bc i could taste the freezer burn flavor. I just have not yet found \"good\" pizza in Vegas that is reasonably priced. That is, until I visited Bambino's on Saturday 3/11/17. I searched \"Pizza Restaurants\" here on Yelp and the reviews by New Yorkers, lured me in. It's a small hole in the wall pizza shop. They have a variety of pizzas. We had the Meat Lovers & Pizza Bianca. At first bite of the Meat Lovers pizza, i immediately noticed how good the sauce  was. Usually,  pizza sauce doesn't do anything for me. But the fact that I did get impressed by pizza sauce alone,  meant something. The dough was thin and crispy. There was so much cheese that it was separating from the crust and toppings were sliding off when i folded the slice in half. This pizza was EXACTLY what I have been searching for in Las Vegas. The crust had the perfect burn marks (not blackened,  but brown and toasty) which tasted amazing!!!!  The Bianca was delicious too, with pure garlic, mozzarella cheese and Ricotta balls. I am so happy that the Yelp community pointed me here. This is now our designated pizza shop. They don't offer delivery yet- they are working on it.",

So glad that I did. My family and I were very pleased and satisfied with our pizza.  It was very well prepared and cooked.

Thin, sauce is yummy & not stingy with cheese.   Just waking in the door is a happy experience. The smell, the NY accent & then the longest 2 minutes of your life waiting for your slice to come out of the oven. OMG I died a thousand deaths waiting for that first slice. It was perfect. Exactly what I had been missing for all these years. Felt like I was back home. Later that evening had to order a pie for the family. This is now a weekly event.   Oh and the other food is great too but I only want pizza. The hot sandwiches are stuffed full, the grandma pie is outrageously good as are the garlic knots.  The guys are great, personable & funny. The shop is spotlessly clean. Did I mention how yummy the smell is? And how the pizza somehow can transport you to your happy place..  Just go there now & get a slice. I guarantee you will be buying a pie & more before the end of the day.",

So we came. We ate. We conquered.  This family-owned joint is cozy on the inside with friendly staff bustling about. Small tables are dressed with checkered tablecloths. Menu items consist of pizza, pasta, subs and other Italian favorites. I had the spaghetti alfredo ($11) and added two meatballs for an additional $3. My other half got a large all meat pizza with extra cheese. It didn't take long for the food to come out and everything was piping hot. The alfredo was good, but not the best I've had. I wished I had gotten something with marinara. The owner actually brought us a little bowl of it so we could taste it and DAMN it was good. I kicked myself even harder having not ordered it. But that just means I have to return. I appreciated the friendly staff who checked on us often and made us feel welcome. We plan on coming back here ASAP!",

Which closed but this place won't do it. It's in a delicious category of its own.   The wings were great. Crispy and tender, not too much sauce. Good sized ranch came with it too. Not skimpy. Fries were limp, almost soggy which were still good but a little disappointing. Good sized but it should be for three bucks. Pizza was large and good, True east coast pizza here, the type that's thing crusted, extra cheesy, flimsy, fold in half, greasy goodness.  Love that they cook the pizza in brick ovens. They just taste different. Impressed she said it would be delivered in 45 to 60 mins and it actually came in 35. Awesome!",

Their food is absolutely amazing, the service is perfect and friendly, and it's not too much to get authentic NY style pizza.  Maximum time I've had to wait for a pizza was 45 minutes and that was due to it being Friday afternoon during the lunch rush. Most of the time I wait 25-30 minutes max and its always fresh, hot, and tastes amazing.  I can't stop raving about this place to anyone looking for good NY style pizza.",

    "text": "Visit on 12/18/16:  I'm not an Italian from New York, or Italian at all for that matter. However, the owners and employees are, and one of the diners that we talked to is yet another New York Italian, complete with the accent. He said that while there are many pizzerias around the city, this is the best and closest to New York-style pizza and serves food that tastes like it came from Little Italy. We also asked him about his dish, which was custom-made. So it seems they will customize dishes for the regulars.  That was his experience, or more like one of many. Ours started with an order of garlic knots and ended with a huge heaping plate of Bolognese spaghetti.  Garlic knots: fluffy, chewy, definitely not anorexic in size, and bursting with butter and garlic bits. Yes, if they claim to be garlic knots, shouldn't they have garlic? Yes, well, I've had the cheap kind at other places that have just some garlic powder baked into them. They come in a small and large order, but I recommend that you get a large order and take home whatever you can't finish. It's that good.  Bolognese spaghetti: house-made sauce with huge portions. My boyfriend and I had trouble finishing a large order. It is big enough for you to share with a friend or possibly two, depending on how much you eat. If you are a teenage boy, you can probably eat a whole order yourself and still have room for a large order of garlic knots and cannolli.  Prices are very good. They are about the same as casual Italian on the Strip, however, the portion size is HUGE and a lot bigger than what you'll get elsewhere. Very good deal. Service was prompt and friendly. Plus it was nice to hear the customers and employees talking to each other about the weather in New York and about cars. Nice ambience.  Yes, it's quite a ways off the Strip, but well worth it. Get over there already!",

He finally found this little gem through a recommendation and took me here to give their pizza a try. We usually buy whole pizzas, however, we stopped here for lunch and decided to go with slices instead.   Bambino's has an everyday lunch special: 2 slices + a pop for $5.00 - AWESOME!  We both chose their pepperoni pizza - SUPER YUMMY! The cheese was tasty, had just the right amount of grease on top, and plenty of meat on top. The crust was decent as well, ate the whole thing :)  The restaurant is very small and I'd imagine during the weekend evenings it gets pretty packed.",

The menu reads \"Creamy Vodka sauce, mozzarella, onions, prosciutto, and a touch of basil.\" What we were served was a cheese pizza with pink sauce. I asked where the toppings were and was told they were blended in the Vodka sauce. Don't bother dining in, the place is tiny and several tables are used as restaurant storage. They have cans of soda, no beer, wine, or fountain drinks. I'm not sure what the appeal is, but after one visit, I won't be back.",

First off we have ordered take out from here one time before and loved the meatball calzone and chicken parm sub.  Today we actually came in and sat down for one of their lunch specials.  Normally we do all our takeout from 2 places close to home.  Villa Pizza being one of them.  This place has great food and great service!  While Villa tastes good their service leaves a lot to be desired (in my opinion).  We arrived just as they were opening and received a welcome hello from the guy behind the counter.  We ordered my personal favorite of Chicken Francese.  It's served with a beverage, garlic knots and a side of pasta all for $9.  Not to shabby considering how much food you get.  Everything tasted great and exactly as one would expect.  They offer fresh parmesan cheese, none of that stuff in packets.  There is a soda fountain so you can refill your glass as often as you like.    The location is just off Durango and Sahara close to the 7-11 and next to the Subway.  This place has food that tastes as though grandma was in the kitchen cooking it herself!  So happy we found a new Italian spot that has friendly EFFICIENTLY staff and reasonably priced  delivery too!",

I love the eggplant rollatini, best I've had outside of New York. My husband is from New York and we both agree that Bambino's makes the best cannoli we have ever had.",

The service is very friendly, great place to eat or take away. I wouldn't mind driving to get pizzas or other Italian dishes from here even though there are so many other options around where we live. How can you beat their special of large pizza n 10 wings for less than $20.",

Being from NJ we are super picky about our pizza and we were really impressed. It tasted really close to back home pizza. We will now eat at 2 places in Vegas for pizza; Roccos and Bambinos! The wings weren't spectacular but the calzone and canolis were excellent and the staff was so friendly. An employee even helped me to my car. Give this place a try! Reasonable prices too!",

Then another time she had me try baked ziti siciliano....really ggod. I wanted to eat more but I decided that I wanted to save it so I could enjoy it again. Tonight I had a stromboli again, and my boyfriend had a Sicilian meat lover's pizza. The pizza was so crispy. It's a family run business and they are very friendly. Also, I highly recommend trying their cannolis.",

Wrong! At the point it's delivered to vegas you've already left so  there's a time machine at the back of the store. They travel back in time at the moment you placed your order and BAM! authentic east coast pizza... how else could it taste so good?",

Even as busy as they were they took the time to explain their pizza style.  I always appreciate good customer service so it's awesome to also get great food with that. Will be back next week to try some more off the menu. Highly recommend the white sauce pizza. Look forward to the wood fire style next.",

In addition, turn your ovens up so the pepperoni gets cooked to a point of changing state (as in some pepperonis cupping/crusting). I really want this place to succeed as I do not like going to the chains but they need to step it up. Let's improve the sauce, put more of it on the pizza, cook the pizza at a higher temp and find a way so the crust is not soggy.",
