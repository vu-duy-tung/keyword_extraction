    "text": "Smells great around this Container Park eatery, but the food is a much different story. Since neither a baked potato or mashed potatoes were included with their combos,  I chose the pork ribs combo platter with coleslaw and a green salad, while my love chose brisket with BBQ pork & beans and a green salad. Not normally a brisket lover, this brisket converted me; which made much more sense after trying to eat one of the pork ribs, because it tasted like beef jerky on a stick. The ribs were so undercooked that the grizzle was perfectly intact and not only looked, but chewed like gum. I realized that the reason their brisket tasted so delicious, was actually because it hadn't been cooked as long as normal, not even quite sure they know of this accidental perfection. I just wished they accidentally left their ribs on the barbie instead. The best part about the place was the option to pour my own BBQ sauce on the side. Trying to overlook the ribs I moved onto the coleslaw. It was seasoned lightly, served in a soupy consistency, but not half bad. I think they may have forgot to salt the cabbage, because the water kept coming, no matter how many times I drained it. I couldn't say much for the green salad, because it was more like a dead, wilted, slimey salad. They tried to hide limp black lettuce, along with rusted romain ends, under fresh green pieces; very shady if you ask me. I should have taken the counter girls bad customer service as a big hint to run to the next place fast, but it smelled so good I gave them the benefit of the doubt. I would buy a few sides of the BBQ baked beans to go from Big Ern's, because they were out of this world, loaded with shredded meat and could have easily been my meal; but never ever would I order the ribs or green salad from this place again. With so many awesome eateries and choices in Las Vegas, I say try another one. The place is small, and on any given day 2 of the 5 inside tables are taken by management.",

My wife ordered the pulled pork sandwich and I ordered the combo plate of brisket, pulled pork with beans and slaw. We sat inside and the young man brought me a plate with brisket and the two sides. I told him that I ordered the pork as well. He checked the receipt and gave me the pulled pork. My wife tasted the pork and since it was extremely dry, she went over to the guy and asked him to change hers to a pulled chicken sandwich. He had not started her sandwich yet and said it was ok to change it. He helped someone else before he made her sandwich. The service was terrible. All of the food should have been brought to the table at the same time. That was the least of the problem. The pulled pork and the brisket were very dry! The slaw and the beans were average. The chicken sandwich and the sauce were just average. I threw almost all of my food in the wastebasket. I do not like to waste food but it was really bad. Dried out food should not be served. It was the worst bbq that I have ever tasted.",

    "text": "After walking the container park for awhile my wife and I decided the smell and line at Big Erns must be because it was so good.we were wrong! I have to believe the good reviews must be from people that have not been exposed to GOOD BBQ. I ordered the three meat special and my wife ordered the meat salad. The three meat plate was good in size with two sides, Mac and cheese and Cole slaw . My three meats were three pork ribs, pulled pork and brisket, a good sampling of what they had to offer. To start the meat was cold, the brisket was cut with the grain and each piece was very dry. I like to use the sauce to accent the bbq but here I needed it to just swallow. Needless to say this made all the meat very tough. Only positive was there was a good smoke ring in each meat. The sides were awful, the cole slaw lacked any flavor and spice, my wife commented it was like eating cabbage and water. The Mac and cheese was very grainy and lacking any really cheesy goodness, I took a picture to explain the comment. My wife's salad was fair with low quality ingredients, canned black olives, bad lettuce and some shaved carrots and dry meat. Considering the mid to high cost this was a very poor food experience.",

The sides, in particular, were terrible. The macaroni was dried out with grease or oil settling at the bottom. It certainly wasn't fresh. What a shame because I love macaroni with melting and stringy cheese. You won't find that there. Also, the potato salad, another one of my favorite sides, was definitely from a jar or a box. It had that preservative, vinegary kind of taste. I took one bite and didn't eat the rest. The brisket, which I usually get when I go for BBQ, was OK and fairly juicy. It was just as small portion, though, and they could probably do more to trim off the fat. The worst thing was that it was very pricey--$9 something for two sides and meat. No way worth it, mainly because of the lack of quality. Get it together Ern!!",

    "text": "I love this place! The food is flavor-able without being too salty. The sides are homemade which makes them tasty, not like store-bought or out of a can and heated. The meats are smoked daily. It's interesting how many people do not understand the difference between wet and dry bbq. Barbecue preference is largely dictated by whether you like saucy or seasoned meat  Dry barbecue is smoked, while the wet variety is usually cooked in a fire pit.  As they say, the secret is in the sauce. Or the rub. And Big Ern uses both which are also homemade. Rubs are typically worked into the meat the night before it's cooked so that the salt can penetrate the cut and tenderize it. But rubs do more than flavor and soften the meat; they also enhance its texture by caramelizing and forming a crispy crust when cooked. Because of the rub's ability to penetrate the meat, fatty cuts like brisket respond well to this type of seasoning. Memphis BBQ is typically a dry barbecue with sauce on the side; in Kansas City and North Carolina, people like their barbecue wet with even more sauce on the side.   The service is great, and I have been lucky to sit inside on all my visits, because of the temperatures, but, I am sure that the heaters would be turned on, if needed.  The price to some may be steep, however, go to any fast food restaurant and up-size that meal, and see what you'll pay for heart-attack in a box. I only have one negative remark and it's to Lonely D who reviewed on 12/23, I understand that the holidays may be lonely for some, but one who is unemployed, was a 3 meat combo really necessary, if you couldn't really afford it?  Ok, another remark to Lonely D. Sorry. French fries, really? i just googled Southern BBQ side dishes and the most common sides are available at Big Ern's. Only one out of 10 sites even listed \"oven-fried\" fries, as a side dish. So I guess, the next time you want to take a \"suicidal\" trip, try McDonald's, i hear they have a form of \"rib\" sandwich (now this is not meant for human consumption).  Big Ern's BBQ is small (meaning a one store location), but a HUGE success!!",

    "text": "We ate here for lunch after seeing another customer enjoying his rib combo meal out in the park. the smell of the ribs were mouth watering and he was happily digging in. I enoy a good BBQ at least 3xs a year. so this was our year end meal as it was new years eve, and a new place to try.  The meal was excellent. we got a 2 rib and brisket combo with collard greens and jambalaya, the second plate was pulled pork and hot link combo with Mac n cheese and sweet potato fries. At first my daughter noticed the pork was cold on the outside, but inside was hot, so it must've been sitting while the fries were being made. the ribs were tender and flavorful and so was the brisket, even though it wasn't cut across the grain. The collards had a tad of spice and weren't chopped up as small as the norm,  but had good flavor. The pulled pork and hot link were also good. Sweet potatoes fries were the best I've had. nice and crispy. and the mac n cheese was smothered in cheese which makes it all the more delicious.  The jambalaya was ok, with bits of hot link in it. All in all this meal was great. we almost cleaned the plate, but left bits n pieces.   I am holding back on the 5th star though. We went at about 1215p on a Friday,  New Years Eve. I'm not sure how crowded this place gets otherwise,  but we didn't have a line when we went in, there were a couple of diners in the establishment which seats maybe 15 max with outside tables as well. unfortunately there was one inconsiderate diner who took up the biggest table in one if the corners that could've sat at east 6. anyway,  shortly after we got our order is when we noticed a line forming. The restaurant is small so it got pretty crowded in there as we were in the other corner dining. I think someone opened the doors so the line could queue outside. That's when I noticed that it was taking some time before you placed your order until you actually got it. it seemed as though we were halfway through our meal before the lady who placed her order right after us finally got hers. I didn't notice how big the kitchen was, or how many  people were back there, but it's BbQ. Most of everything on the menu should already be made, except for the fries and chips. maybe that's what people were ordering?  I couldn't see justification for the long wait for your order. just for that fact, I may be hesitant to go back there, but if I find myself back at the Container park, I may dine there again.",

    "text": "Deep sigh... I've been here two maybe three time (once was for free courtesy of my job) and the only thing that has stood out in my mind was the fact that they were out of everything.   Tonight was no different. After waiting in line for about 5minutes someone yells from the back \"we're out of :::insert majority of the menu items here::\" I have been craving bbq for weeks so I decided to stay in line and hope for the best. Funny thing the couple behind me made a comment about how dirty the kitchen looked. I thought to myself \"it's a bbq place, what do you expect...\" In hindsight I feel like that was the Universe trying to tell me something.   After what seemed like an eternity's wait I finally made it to the cashier, who made no effort to hide her readiness to be off  he clock already. I intended to order a hot link plate, baked beans, and potato salad. But, you guessed it, they were out of potato salad, so I ordered the greens instead. I waited for my food, a girl, looking even more miserable that the first, brought it to me on a \"for here\" plate. I asked her if I could get it to go & sh begrudgingly obliged, after asking me again \"are you sure you don't want to just eat here.\"   Fast forward.  Get home, ready to dive into the meal that I've been craving. I break open the dinner roll and low and behold there's MOLD. Needless to say I had to trash the whole damn meal and I'm certainly pissed mostly be I was so close to feeding the craving -__- Definitely won't be eating here again and I will strongly advise my company to not cater from here either    I never write these things looking for anything in return but this time I definitely want my money back.",

As for the  food, I'm from the South originally so I'll admit I'm picky about BBQ  The brisket was excellent and had a smoky flavor, a little bit of char, and was so tender I was able to cut it with just a fork. While the meat was excellent, the sides are very much hit or miss. They didn't have fried okra which was a bit disappointing. The BBQ beans were excellent with a strong garlic/onion flavor that is unique and enjoyable. The mac and cheese was just okay and while tasty it was VERY oily.   Overall, I enjoyed my meal here and would return but remember the meat is the star here and the sides are just okay for the most part.",

A group of my friends and I hit the downtown scene that day and Big Ern's was our pre-game stop and our dinner for the night. We got there at around 7-8pm and it was pretty busy. We were a group of 6 and sat outside along the playground. I ordered a combo platter: Brisket, mac n cheese, and potato salad with a PBR. The prices are very reasonable. The service was fast and the staff members were humble. The brisket was tender, sides were tasty too. If you're going downtown this is one of the restaurants I would suggest you to eat at.",

I also don't want to drop 15 bucks on lunch too often, so I opted for a brisket sandwich and drink....which still came out to 12-13 dollars.  For that price? Not worth it. The sandwich and coleslaw were mediocre. The brisket was just lumps of meat in a little bit of sauce, there was nothing else on the sandwich. It wasn't too flavorful, and it also wasn't much food. I can't justify spending that amount of coin on something that doesn't taste amazing, and doesn't even fill me up.   I was hoping the 3.5 rating was wrong and it was better than the average suggested, but for my experience it was not.",

I had high expectations because of their location, but the food just didn't measure up. It's sad to say, but the hot dog place just around the corner was much better when we ate there the day before.

The pulled pork was good and I enjoyed the fact that it was not oversauced and there was extra sauce available but the sauce was tasty but had no wow factor to separate it from other sauces.  The pork itself was very tender.  The star of the plate was the links.  A little kick of spice set them apart from the rest of the food and I wish that was the item I had chosen as my only item.

Kids finished their food which is hard to do for our kids because they are super picky. I got the chicken and links with a side of BBQ beans and green salad. Meat was tasty and the BBQ beans were super good. We ate inside and when all finished Big Ern pulled out a bucket of toys and gave all the kids a toy. We love supporting MA an PA shops since we own one as well. Keep up the great work Ern!",

The brisket itself was full of fat and not even melted down. Not to say a good brisket has to have so much fat but should be melted off a bit.. Most of the meat was fatty. the sauce was just ok . The meat was a bit salty. Now lets get to the sides.The chicken wings were salty . The mac and cheese was old . Not saucy but lumpy. Not my idea of good mac and cheese. The okra was good and probably the best part of the meal. The lemonade was from the fountain. If i went 2 doors down there was fresh sqeezed lemonade. My bad. Worse of all the french fries were soggy and burnt at the same time. One employee told the Boss  the iodized salt may be the problem but it fell on deft ears. Not even a blink. The good was the BBQ sauce was better than average. Okra was good. The bad was everything else",

He used to love chicken and then over time he just wouldn't eat any meat for some odd reason. We ordered the BBQ Pulled Pork sandwich and the Brisket Sandwich and both were so delicious and perfectly cooked. Not only did my husband and I think it was wonderful, our son grabbed a piece of brisket and started eating it. Piece after piece. I had to go inside and tell them how much it meant to us that he was eating. That's how good it was! The customer service was AMAZING. Smiling faces, friendly staff. I was totally floored by the whole experience. Thank you guys for being so awesome!",

Staff was friendly, food was quite tasty and we even ended up buying some bottled BBQ sauce to enjoy at home. Highly recommend the potato salad.

Overall, I've have and made better BBQ.  Their house seasoning is really a weak blend of spices...so everything tastes the same and needs a LOT of sauce.",

The staff, a couple of cool cats inside were happy and fun and very informative. Remarkably clean for a BBQ place.  I had three meat plate, ribs, brisket, pulled pork. Perfectly smoked melt in your mouth Q, sauce on the side as good Q should have. Excellent slaw!

We have a hard time finding good BBQ in Vegas, so I searched Yelp for something new and found Big Ern's BBQ. Who knew this would turn out to be one of the best dining experiences we've had in awhile! The two young men working that evening showed us a level of customer services that is lacking in most public-facing establishments. We were greeted when we walked in and offered samples of anything on the menu so that we would be happy with our order. I joked that it was my husband's birthday and asked if they would come out and sing him a song. They actually played Stevie Wonder's, \"Happy Birthday\" over the speakers and everyone inside began sending birthday wishes to my husband. It was pretty cool. Food was great and the service was even better! We will surely be back.",

The pictures look good but the actual BBQ is even better .Located in the Container Park there is seating on  the stores porch or right next to the tree house. I have visited several times during the weekend and also during the afternoon and the store has always been clean and staff very friendly.  The 3 meat plate is good if you want to get an idea of what the menu offers. I have had the ribs(only 3 come with any of the plates),half chicken and pulled pork with macaroni and potato salad. Everything was cooked to perfection. The meats were all tender and I felt had the right amount of BBQ sauce. The potato salad is my favorite. The macaroni feels more stove top to me, I'm a baked macaroni type. However my little ones like it. My daughter says, \"it's cheesy, thumbs up.\" The portions are very generous; the three meat plate definitely can feed two adults. On a different occasion I ordered the full rack of ribs. It's our favorite of everything on the menu. Definitely worth the money !  The kids love the chicken tenders with fries. The chicken tenders are huge and they give out a lot if fries. The kids were not really a fan of the fries. I think it's because they prefer wedges or standard fries. I brought a friend with me the last time and her daughter wasn't a fan of the fries either. They did however like the sweet potato fries ( go figure).  The free refills on the kids drinks is also a plus.  If you are looking for great BBQ this is the spot. I will definitely make it a point to visit again.",

The food came out very promptly, but I never got my water. When I asked for it, the cashier gave me attitude about it as though I never ordered it. Now the food: the chicken was dry. The Mac and cheese was obviously cooked awhile ago because it was crumbly, not cheesy, and the melted cheese on top of it was hard. Sadly, the potato salad was the best thing. The roll that is served with the meal was rock hard. Everyone in my party complained that their food was not fresh. I wish I could get my money back.",

The hot links were a little dried up but the chicken and pulled pork was pretty good.  No complaints on the beans or coleslaw, but the only \"potatular\" items available were bagged chips.   Be prepared to spend a little more money as this place is not cheap.  Overall service was excellent.",

Chicken was so dry I literally choked trying to eat it, sauce didn't even help. The brisket was almost as dry as the chicken.... Pork was tender but the flavor was lacking.... And the sweet tea.... Not so good. I would avoid if you like BBQ!",

    "text": "Just had the Brisket and a side of Mac-n-Cheese with a roll. For $10, I didn't feel ripped off but I didn't feel like it was a great deal either.  The Brisket was Ok but I was kind of disappointed. Nothing worth going out of the way for in my opinion but than again, I've had Brisket from world class TX BBQ joints where Brisket is done right and is the crack of BBQ. (When I'm visiting relatives in TX, I'm pretty much ordering it up every other day... LOL.)  The brisket served to me was medium well done, no smoke ring, little to no rub, very lean and dry. It was tender but it just didn't have much flavor to to it. Highly doubt it's being smoked over Hickory. Not sure if it is the quality of the brisket they are using or if they are taking short cuts. Probably a combination of both from what I could tell. (Wholesale, a good quality brisket is going for only about $3 a lb so if you are going to turn around and sell it for $17 a lb, than don't take short cuts preparing it.)  Luckily the spicy BBQ sauce they have there is awesome and gave it some flavor. (Spicy BBQ sauce made this 3 stars instead of 2.) I normally use little to no BBQ sauce for Brisket done right but going through a container was pretty much mandatory for this Brisket.  Mac-n-Cheese -- Pretty good. Had better, had much worse.  Roll? Stale / Old and completely unacceptable to be served. The rolls I bought a couple of weeks ago sitting in my pantry that I'm saving for the ducks are in better shape.  Unfortunately, this is Vegas and finding some good Brisket done right is certainly a challenge.",

After leaving a music festival in the area I came across a giant praying mantis shooting out flames. It was the container park, so we took a stroll inside.  The park it's self is kind of cool. They do all types of events. Feeling a little hungry came across a few eateries inside the park.     For some reason BBQ sounded good so in I went to Big Ern's. Kept it simple and got a pull pork sandwich & potato salad. Nothing wrong with the food, or service. People were cool and the food was good. Enjoyed the BBQ sauce. Nothing super special at the same time it was flavorful, with a hint of smokey flavor. Potato salad is a simple homemade style. Enjoyed it all, it was a good refuel to continue the night in downtown Vegas. Definitely a place to check out.",

The Container Park caught our attention and we noticed Big Ern's when we checked out what was inside the Container Park.    I'm here to tell you this is some very good barbecue.  The pulled pork and beef brisket I had were both excellent, and the portions were generous for the price.    For sides, I got the barbecue beans the cole slaw, which were both excellent.    We were eating late (10:00 p.m.) on a Sunday night, which made eating out the tables very pleasant.  It even rained briefly, which cooled things down a bit even more.  I love a light rain in the desert in the summer.    I found the prices to be very reasonable given he quality of the food and portion sizes.   My only gripe is they locked the doors at 10:45 (15 minutes before closing), which meant I could not get a second beer, and my buddy could not get some more barbecue sauce.  We saw a small group of would be customers get turned away, also. If you say you close at 11:00, stay open till 11:00.    Bottom line.  I've had good barbecue in Memphis.  This place is legit.  If you were to add collard greens and white bread and perhaps some fried pickles to the mix. . . .",

We paid and took a seat outside and was approached by the cook, about four minutes after placing our order, to tell us there was no Mac and cheese and had a choice between, fries, chili, or beans.   For a restaurant that didn't really have much to offer us this afternoon, it was decent food. The service was pretty fast.

We walk back inside only to be told by the cashier to go to the guy working the kitchen. I stood there for a good few minutes and he never even attempted to see if I needed help. Finally when my husband came in, I was apparently good enough to talk to. I told him that we had ordered our food 30 minutes ago and no one called our names. He told us very matter of factly that we should have listened for our name. I know for a fact they never walk out to the porch area to call our names as we were sitting there the entire time and there was about 4 of us. I heard them walk out to the porch and call others. At least one of us would of heard the name. I wasn't even too mad about the late food, it was the fact that he was extremely rude and even made it seem like we were idiots that didn't know how to listen for our own names. He could of acted like he cared a bit more. I don't know how the mix up happened, but it did. I usually came here often for food, and my husband usually stops in for dinner during his shifts if he is in the area. I'm sorry to say that we won't be back again.",

Super fun and the adults can hangout and have a cocktail or beer as well.   Parking is pretty convenient on side of park as well as lots across the street. $2 per hour i paid for metered parking. Dont forget to slip it on the dash before entering.  There are tons of shops, eateries and bars for your taste. We decided on Big Erns for a quick bite.   Meal of choice: Kids Meal - 2 piece chicken tender with fries (these tenders were huge btw) Pulled pork sandwich w/ a choice of side: potato salad was my choice and 2 soft drinks. $18 total and added a tip:)  Service was great, gentlemen assisting was really friendly and even brought the food outside for us.  Overall the kids good was huge my 3 year ate a third of it as they do most of the time. Big enough to share for 2 toddlers. And the pulled pork was just good not great, I think i liked the salad more then the sandwich. I will be back again to bring my husband and maybe try a platter next time.",

The restaurant is nothing special but has a nice welcoming porch where in the warm months, one can eat outside. The interior has a couple of tables and booths where you see the traditional red/white checkered table cloths adorning each table. Not a ton of space but ample. The kitchen takes up most of the restaurant in terms of space.   My friend and I have only ordered the pulled pork sandwich both times and found out to be pretty good. It is served with hot, crispy fries and the sandwich is big piled high with pork. Of course, there is always room for more BBQ sauce which makes it taste even better. The pork itself is moist and tender.   I am by no means a professional when it comes to BBQ and how it should be cooked, prepared etc, but this place satisfies my craving for BBQ food when I feel the need.",

We went in right at noon and managed to get a table inside so we could cool off in the AC. Don't forget to check in so you can get a free side with purchase! We opted for the garden salad with brisket and a side of sweet potato fries. The salad was pretty basic (romaine, purple onion, green bell pepper, shredded cheddar, tomatoes, olives and croutons) and they give you two sizeable portions of dressing. The brisket is served chopped and delicious! It was very tender and had such w great amount of flavor - it didn't need a drop of sauce! As for the fries, it's a pretty huge serving! Definitely enough for two or three people to share! They're thick cut and on the soft side, but taste oh-so-good!   This will definitely be our go-to when we're spending an afternoon at the Container Park!",

The wings were small and a little over cooked, the ribs were perfect.  The meal came with 4 rolls and 2 large PBRs for $30.  It was a good deal and we had some leftovers, between 2 of us.  If they could improve and increase the sauces, that would be my best advice.  Add a sweet sauce and a mustard bbq sauce.",

Long story short they brought out my brisket and I opened the box and it was shredded a little bit. I took it back in and asked if there was a mistake and she told me that it was brisket, just really, really tender. No problem. I left and joined my wife, the cook came out with another box of this beautifully sliced brisket like you would see in a cookbook. Perfect. He apologized and handed it to me. Wow, attentive and kind. We will be coming back, definitely. Thanks guys!! Made our night after numerous disappointments on the strip.",

The full rack was $25.00 and it fed four people nicely, we were just a little hungry and they were perfect.  The tables outside the joint were nice and clean as well.    Thanks Big Erns!",

I have tried them all and I know I can always depend on Big Erns.  I saw some bad reviews and just wanted to add a few things.  I am from Texas, so this is not the best BBQ I have ever had, but it is darn good and consistent for the price.  I like the pulled pork and have never had issue with the buns in the ten or so times I have eaten the pulled pork sandwich.   I like that they give me the choice of putting on as much or as little of either mild or spicy barbecue sauce.  I like that the drink prices are low and you don't see that \"concession stand\" attitude to pricing that some downtown establishments have.  The service has much improved and I like that Big Ern is often right there talking and meeting customers.     I am a regular here and will continue to be.  Good barbecue at a good price.  To be balanced, I like the beans but do find the potato salad bland, though it looks fantastic.   Still room for some improvement,  but a solid place that can be counted on!",

Id be surprised if any of it is smoked. It all tastes like it was cooked in an oven with liquid smoke and spices. The meat is low quality. Very fatty and not a lot of actual meat. In fact the least greasy thing I had was the fries. Lol. The rib tips were either nothing but grisel or they were burnt and dry. If you are desperate you can give it a try, but comparing this to bbq is like saying taco bell is Mexican food.",

    "text": "Had a plate with: - Ribs - Brisket - Macaroni & Cheese - Coleslaw  Food ======== Brisket was the best item of the plate.  Ribs didn't fall off the rib and were a little to dry for my taste. As sides go, I picked what should be the best indicators of a bbq joint, both of which were incredibly disappointing. They were both bland and lacked that kick that should be saying, \"Welcome to big Ern's, you've just been branded for life by our signature sides!\" Hoping they'll tweak them a little bit.  Service ======== Note: It was the first official day of the container park, so take this part of the review with a grain of salt and I wouldn't consider it indicative of a typical visit. **Service has no bearing on my star rating.**  Ordering took a while. It could've been the spike in customers and first time for the cashiers to be using Square, but it took a really long time for an individual to place an order (somewhere around 2 minutes, which is significant considering how fast the process should be at a place where they take your order at a counter).  Service line was fast, but they forgot one of my sides.  Overall, everyone working there was really nice and I think they probably have some kinks to work out, but the main things I'd look for next time I go back are more enjoyable/memorable sides and ribs that make your mouth water whenever you hear someone mention Big Ern's.",

    "text": "You can always trust a place that has PBR on tap and Big Ern's is no exception to the rule & at 2.95 for a 16 oz cup (i think) it's yet again a pleasure to see. I enjoy all of the sandwiches they have to offer. I like the pulled pork the most with the chicken and brisket tying for second. I really like the spicy BBQ sauce they offer on the side.   The mac & cheese was not that home style 4 cheese slow baked I was hoping for. Instead it tasted like your run of the mill mac-n-cheese, which made my stomach sad.  Don't forget the free refills on lemonade, cha ching! That's a plus, especially if you plan on hanging at Container Park for a bit. If yiu plan on playing the light game where you run around like maniacs then be sure to grab yourself one of these. Don't waste your time asking about free refills on the PBR, it's apparently not up for negotiation lol  The kids menu is also a good bang for your buck weighing in at $5.95 for a decent sized slider w/ a side.",

The restaurant has a banner in the front stating ,\"2014 Best BBQ in Las Vegas\" but that must've been self-proclaimed.  The menu is a bit confusing and the choices seem really limited which work for some places but definitely not here.  Food:  I got the ribs because lets face it, bbq = ribs.  Plus if you're going to endorse your restaurant as the best bbq in las vegas you better have some great sauce and tender juicy meat to go along with it.... NOPE!  The meat was dried throughout the rib and I was chewing on it like a piece of beef jerky.  The potato salad tasted like the ones you buy from Albertsons but spoiled.  The pork and beans weren't too bad but really that's not going to bring me back here.  Overall: This place has the dryest, most flavorless ribs i've ever had... I love barbecue and have had my share of barbecue all around and this is the absolute worst.  Don't let the aroma fool you, do not eat here!",

    "text": "An honest 3 1/2 stars.  I really wanted to like Big Ern's BBQ more.  It's good, but only comes out to average for me when compared to other BBQ.  And we all are biased when it comes to BBQ because we all have different tastes.  Some love smoke, some love spice, some love sauce, some love tomato-based, some love mustard-based, and some love vinegar-based.  Hell, some folks even love BOILED ribs!  Just as a note people, boiled meats are NOT BBQ.  This was our meal when we visited Downtown Container Park.  It looked interesting because when we where there, this place had the longest line.  Figure the food must be the best around, right?  Well, yes and no.  It is arguably one of the best places to eat within the park.  But for BBQ it's not my favorite.  But still good for what it is.  We had the two item combo platter of pulled pork and hot link.  The platter came with a roll, and two sides.  Most popular items leaving the kitchen that day were the mac & cheese, and the baked beans.  We ended up trying those.  We also picked up an extra hot link sandwich to try.  Verdict?  As I said before, good but not great.  The pulled pork was a bit on the dry side and was light on flavor, but good on smoke.  The sides were OK - the mac & cheese was yummy but needed a bit more cheese.  The baked beans were decent, not overly sweet and I think there may have been bits of pork in it.  The star of the show was the hot link.  These I liked very much!  Spicy, good flavor, and good texture.  They had a great chew when you bit in to one, nice snap.  Delicious on the hot link sandwich.  Their BBQ sauce isn't bad either, tomato-based, it appeals to those who like a sweeter sauce.  Slather this all over your hot link sandwich and it was good eats.  Reason why it's down a 1/2 star is the darn pricing.  Whoa, I get it, everything in Downtown Container Park is pricey!  I mean for $12 on a two item combo platter I was expecting a bit more food.  It's good for one person, a bit difficult for two to share.  The sandwiches are $7 each but don't come with a side.  It will cost you $2 more to add that on.  Adding on a soft drink will tack on another $2.  Don't go to Big Ern's BBQ expecting a cheap meal!  But then again don't go to Downtown Container Park and expect anything on the cheap.",

    "text": "Warning: This restaurant has a Grade C as of December 2015!!  We had family in town and none of us had ever been to the container park, so we decided to check it out. It was a bad idea altogether, we should have just stayed at the Fremont! But anyway, after walking around we decided to stay and eat dinner at one of the few restaurants at this place. From what we saw, our choices were BBQ, Mexican and Hot Dogs, so we decided to go with BBQ. The employees were just standing around and talking when we walked in. They did greet us, but didn't seem very friendly. The menu wasn't huge. They have the normal choices of Ribs, Pulled Pork, Brisket and Chicken. I decided to go with the Pulled Pork Dinner with Mac and Cheese and Sweet Potato Fries. Right when the cashier handed the receipt to my brother in law, that is when I noticed the sign showing the Grade C. Crap! Well, it was too late now. The food was already paid for and I doubt that the employees would be willing to give a refund. If we didn't have family with us, I probably would have fought it lol.  The food was brought out by one of the cooks and it just went downhill from there. I took the first bite of the pulled pork and it was cold. Maybe it was just that side of the plate? So I took another bite from the other side and it was still cold. Ugh, really? It wasn't fresh, but did they forget to warm up the pork or did they just not give a damn? I think they just poured BBQ sauce over it and called it a day. It was so bad that I can't even remember if the BBQ sauce was good or not. The Mac and Cheese and the Sweet Potato Fries were actually hot, but there was nothing spectacular about them either. I didn't even try the roll that came with the dinner, the bread was not edible at all.   The next day, I felt sick, even though I barely ate the food. Well, I did eat food from Panera as well, but I am 99.9% sure I got sick from this place! Don't expect anything good from a BBQ restaurant in a container.   Never Again!! Stay Away!!",

Josh picked big Erls based on the yummy smell of BBQ wafting out the door. Once inside we knew we were in the right place, nice and cozy and full of yummy smells. The lady taking our order up front was really nice and made me feel happy. Food was delivered fast, and on time, by a friendly gentleman with an impressive beard and and flowing pony tail!   I asked Josh how the bread was, he shrugged his shoulders and said.... it's ok id rather have corn bread. I asked Luke how the Mac N Cheese was, he said.... mmm pretty good! Josh like the pulled pork, and Kyle said the ribs were decent, he said they fell right off the bone (thats a good thing). Josh liked the beans. Everyone was happy!",

    "text": "After our Zappos tour, we headed over to the Downtown Container Park as it's part of Zappos CEO, Tony Hsieh's new $350M downtown Las Vegas initiative.  Big Ern was one of Zappos' employees who decided to follow his dream and have his own BBQ place.  I do agree with fellow Yelpers that the menu is not that order friendly initially but what I ordered was pretty good.  Obviously, I stayed away from the pulled pork after reading all the not-so-wonderful reviews on that item. I ordered the brisket salad and it was very flavorful and tasty.  The workers were nice and courteous as well.  I guess I just felt that the overall value and experience was not as good as the ones I had experienced in Texas. If you do visit the Downtown Container Park and crave BBQ, I would go with the brisket as it's quite tender and tasty. I also ordered the rib tips and they were ok, but not something I would order again. Wish I could give this place higher ratings, but I must stay True to my reviews.",

Walked in my partner and child(4 years old) ordered a pulled pork sandwich with a 2 item (bris & ribs) VERY DRY CHUCKS & Ribs were all fat. My pork sandwich was very dry went to add more bbq sauce to only LMAO that it wasn't even and homemade recipe( FYI meal was 23 bucks) should be able to get something more from the heart. The 2 meat combo that my partner order came with 2 sides got bbq beans and salad( NOT MUCH CHOICES FOR SIDES) in the meantime we both look at each other saying why did we send 20 on a fast food bbq that was so horrible. So my child took a bite of the salad then decide she didn't want it.... So I started to eat the salad to bite into a twisty tie (like the ones that come on bread bags). I almost lost it. Stayed calm because my 1st thought was what if my 4 year old got it so I immediately stop eating we excuse are selves and my partner goes to the cashier and demands the money back. She did and offered my partner a beer but I will never never ever eat there again. Last statement I noticed there was a award FOR BEST LAS VEGAS BBQ something for this year. Wow judges not sure what you do to let these business win because they do not deserve an award...",

I searched yelp and came across this bbq place. We really love bbq and I've been wanting a reason to come check out the container park for a long time.   Loved the ambiance and eating on the \"porch\" of this container restaurant while my children played in the awesome structure across from it.   I liked my wings and fries a LOT. Kids didn't love the pulled pork sandwiches but they loved the fries. I am so sad to say this but I hated the bbq sauce. Not my style at all and maybe that's why the kids didn't like the sammies. Portions were a good size and the meal was really filling but it was quite expensive. Drinks were expensive too and came in a 12 oz plastic cup and no refills. Eek.   Service was very friendly, but slow. They also seemed pretty shocked at the size of our order lol. Outside of Utah I guess having 5 kids is kind of unusual.",

When we walked in, the chef took our order and rang us up. Everything my husband and I had was tasty and cooked to perfection. This restaurant is located Inside of an old shopping container, so it's small and seating is limited inside. It gives the whole place a really close feel, as if you are having a huge family dinner with a bunch of strangers. But in a good way. When we were there, they played young Michael Jackson songs. It was a fun experience, good price ($25 for two people) and really really good food!",

Located inside the now famous, Container Park, if BBQ is what your looking for, than this is the place.  It was a perfect day, the nice wind with the Las Vegas sun at a nice cool temperature made a wonderful background to our birthday boy lunch.  The staff is super friendly, the menu has  been revamped & the prices are comparable to the rest of Fremont East.  From the brisket, wings, pulled pork, the red beans & rice (you have to try it - so good!), spicy links, sweet potato fries & Mac and cheese (whew!), you won't be disappointed.  We were a group of six foodies & we sampled each other's plates & we all spoke the same words, \"Yum!\"  It was a great experience and I hope to come back & revisit the experience all over again!  Thanks for the good grub!",

I have NEVER in my life left a bad review for anyone, until today. My daughter who is only 6 went up to the cashier and politely asked for a refill on her drink, but told her they didn't give refills after they just charged the 7 members of our family a $1 upgrade per cup to get a larger cup which didn't even seem larger seemed as if it was a 6 oz cup. The kids meal seemed as if it was a 2oz cup or equivalent to a Jell-O shot cup. What a joke! Then after my daughter started balling crying in the restaurant she still did nothing to accommodate. Like SERIOUSLY?! Your customers are the reason we keep small business like you open!! To treat a customer like that, let alone a child is immorally wrong! And y'all claim your a family business? I don't see how when you treat your customers like dirt. As for the food, yes Texas knows everything about bbq, but it would have actually been maybe decent if it would have came out hot and not cold. If your coming with a big family (7) think again as there is maybe a total of 3 tables in the entire place.",

We had the Mac n cheese for our side, and it was really creamy and thick where the cheese kind sticks to your teeth. Didn't care too much for this consistency. They were out of potatoes this day so didn't get to try the baked potato. Did try the fried okra, and it too was just ok.

The BF and I weren't hungry but, decided to just try it since we were already at Container Park.   Once we entered the place, the girl at the counter told us that they were out of all the meats, except the sausage links...which is funny because that's the one meat I didn't wanna try lol  Regardless, we went with it - sausage links sandwich and baked beans (for me) and mac and cheese (for him). The girl was nice enough to give us the extra side for free!  We got the sandwich first and once we opened our plate lunch, we had cut up sausage links and bread.  Literally!  No sandwich in sight. I looked at my BF, then the menu, and was like: \"I thought this was a sandwich?????!\" Let it be known that the sausage links were tasty.  Then we get our side of baked beans and mac and cheese in cups. CUPS! The kinda cups that they prolly use for their complimentary waters.  The baked beans were so hot that my cup started to melt at the bottom and completely disfigured. I couldn't stop laughing about it! Baked beans weren't anything to rave about...nothing sweet or caramelized. Tasted like it was from a can, to be honest.  The mac and cheese was penne pasta with soupy sauce.  Overall, disappointing experience. Only saving grace and only reason I didn't give it 1 star was the great service and personalities of those behind the counter.  ****** This place just opened so I'm sure they have ALOT of glitches to figure out. Most def has a lot of potential.   Local small businesses are what Container Park is all about, after all.",

    "text": "I dub Big Ern's the first place I've grubbed at in the Container Park. Pricing is a little steep but considering the tastiness of the food, I'll accept it. The place is extremely small, perhaps fitting around 10 or less people in the seating area.  There are seats out on the patio, but it was about 40 degrees outside when I went.  The girl who rang me up kept on looking at me like she was annoyed with what I was ordering. I was glad I was wearing sunglasses because we could've had a terrible stare-down competition.   Besides the service being weird or rude--or whatever you would categorize it as--I had a lovely BBQ chicken sandwich. The chicken was a little on the dry-side, but I looooved the bbq sauce that came on it. I am usually a hater of bbq sauces because they usually over power my taste buds. But this sauce actually complimented the chicken well.    The only critique of the sandwich was that the bun was cold and it would have been TOTALLY awesome if it was warm and toasted. But hey, what can I do?  My dude got the two meat combo with sausage and brisket. He said he liked it. So I snuck a piece of his brisket and it was indeed tasty but a little dry.   Overall the experience was underwhelming. I won't NOT come back, because I think the sauce they use is fantastic. However, I don't see myself as a frequenter.",

There's like five and one is chips (I've already named three of them).",

The food looks delicious, the BBQ is tasty, but the bun was kind of soggy, the Mac & Cheese, Baked Beans & Potato salad looked great, but had really no taste, pretty much just bland. With a little effort it could be a lot better! The pulled pork from the sandwich, the beef brisket and the shredded chicken were great with just the BBQ sauce. They have some decent outdoor seating across from the kids play area.  BTW: great place for kids!! but don't come after a 5k cause its crazy busy!!",

I'm speaking from me and the boyfriend's experience, as well as observing other patrons' experience around us.  Don't get me wrong 'cause all the people we talked to were nice. It's just that we initially got half our order, then when we waited about 10-15 minutes for the other half, one of the guys said he accidentally threw out our ticket. The kitchen made up for it by giving us a substitution, but I honestly know they lost some profit in doing that. I appreciate the accommodation, but can't help being worried if this constantly happens. So the food...  Definitely like the barbecue sauces. The meat was tender enough that it didn't take much to tear apart. The Mac 'n Cheese was gooey with cheese, and I like the peppered flavor to it so that it wasn't bland. The Loaded Potato does not skimp on meat, beans, cheese or barbecue sauce. Oh man... I could've eaten that just by itself.  I'd definitely go back for barbecue cravings.",

The kid's meal cost $5.95 each and the portions were miniscule. I usually have to beg them to finish their meal but after eating at Big Ern's, the kids kept asking for more.

    "text": "Some Vegas locals I was visiting wanted to show me around Fremont Street this past Saturday night while I was in town and decided that going to the Container Park for our (very late) dinner would be the best so that we'd have choices and not all have to get the same thing.  I love all things meat (if you have read my reviews, you know this) and BBQ is an absolute favorite of mine, especially brisket.  What do I like more than brisket?  Macaroni and cheese!  So I was pretty darn excited over this dinner. It took a little longer to get than I expected, but maybe it just felt like we were waiting forever. Our friends were able to walk over to the hot dog place in Container Park, order their dogs, and walk back over before we'd gotten ours, and there hadn't been other people in line ordering before us. Luckily, I wasn't ravenous or anything so the wait wasn't bad.  At first glance, because my eyes are often bigger than my stomach, the three slices of brisket didn't look like much, but it was plenty and I didn't quite finish. If I had, I may have needed to be carried to the car.  The meat itself was super tender and melt in your mouth. It so easily came apart, there was no need for even a plastic knife. The fat came off really easily which is important to me as someone who really hates chewing fatty bits with the meat. The meat itself was unfortunately kind of salty, which is really noticeable to me (and was to my friend as well, who got the pulled pork and ribs - I tried his pulled pork and it was DELISH).  The BBQ sauce was good, if a little bit strong in both the sweet and tangy departments. It's hard for me to find a restaurant BBQ sauce I really like, but I hold out hope. This sauce reminded me of the one I've had at Phil's BBQ in San Diego - people go gaga over that stuff but the sweet plus the little hint of sour bite means that halfway through the meal, my tongue starts to get a little sore like I've been pounding sour candies.  The macaroni and cheese was definitely my favorite part. A lot of BBQ places serve rather dry mac and cheese, but I like mine drenched in creamy, oozy cheese sauce. This wasn't super oozy, but it was creamy and cheesy, rich and comforting. The little styrofoam cup's worth was unassuming but plenty!  Overall, it was a perfectly fine late-night meal for a Saturday of walking around Fremont. If I found myself back at Container Park, I'd probably eat here again but get the pulled pork. Or maybe just a ton of macaroni and cheese on its own!",

    "text": "It was time for date night and we both settled on this place.  I've known the owner for years and wanted to support his business.  My date wanted to eat BBQ so it was a win win situation.  Located in the Container Park, this place recently opened and was part of the grand opening in this new outdoor center.    Just like other businesses, this place is located in a reused shipping container.  Inside is super quaint, they use the space well!  The kitchen is stainless steel, colors of red and white trimmings seem to work well!  The menu is displayed on the front wall with wooden panels stacked on a red background.  You literally order your food, grad your utensils and condiments on the other side and have a seat.  There's inside and outside seating.  Inside, you have wooden tables, as well as red, white and blue chairs.  Outside seating makes you feel like your sitting on an outdoor porch.  Literally, you are! LOL.    For dinner, I got the 2 meat comb platter for $11.95.  I chose the Brisket and Chopped Chicken with two sides of cole slaw and BBQ baked beans.  The cole slaw wasn't the best in my opinion.  What seemed like a vinegar based slaw, was actually a watery mayonnaise based slaw.  Too soupy.  The baked beans was the star of the meal!  Super flavorful, sweet, salty with the pork.  It was awesome!  For the meats, the chicken was good.  It didn't have that smoky flavor I was hoping for, but seemed to do well with the BBQ sauce.  The brisket unfortunately was too dry.  You needed the BBQ sauce for it.  I was hoping for more of a marbleized flavor but didn't.  The roll served with my meal almost tasted like cardboard. It was so dry.  I wish they took the time to at least warm it up or toast it.    I'm definitely going to be back.  I support all of our downtown business and certainly wish the best for Ernie and his business. I hope my next trip will change my mind on my overall ratings.  For now, it was just ok.  Good luck to them in their future endeavors!",

    "text": "Overall review notes: Don't bother.  There are several choices at the Container Park when it comes to food, we happened to pick this one. The place smelled amazing! The line was forever long, that's a good sign right? ... how could this place only have a 2.5 star rating?!? That's what I kept telling myself as I stood in line for what felt like a lifetime. When the bf got to the counter we realized what was causing the wait. The one, count them one person working the register was a young girl who was seriously either high as a kite or hung over. She was forever slow and had no enthusiasm or urgency to place the order.  Once we placed our order the food came out relatively fast, but it was awful! I can honestly say it's the worst BBQ I've ever had - including my own burnt BBQ at home. It was such a disappointment because it all looked so good!  The Pulled Pork Sandwich ($8.95 with 1 side) - the bun was wet and soggy on the bottom, from i don't know what, probably being frozen at some point. There was almost no BBQ sauce on it, definitely not enough to cover the meat. I didn't even eat the bun, and had only 1/2 of the pork.  The Baked Beans - looked amazing, but were not sweet or smoky at all. I can't put my finger on what they tasted like, cardboard maybe??  The Potato Salad - bland, almost no flavor.  The Mac and Cheese - not creamy, not very cheesy, mostly just tasted like noodles. Bleh.  The BF ordered the 2 meat plate with Beef Brisket and Chicken. his meat had almost no BBQ either. We got extra on the side and had to keep pouring it on. But even the BBQ sauce is just meh.   Really, just don't bother. It's not worth the time or the money, or the calories. we didn't eat half of any single item.",

We stumbled upon the Container park when we went looking for the Arts District  The brisket is moist and the fat cap on it is loaded with flavor. The pulled pork is delicious and the bbq sauce is just right.   The portion sizes are large and the price is affordable.  We shared the 3 meat combo plate that comes with 2 sides and a roll for $14.95. We hadnt had anything to eat all day so we were starving and still this was enough for us.   I wish we could come back but we live a little ways away.... about 2,519 miles.   See ya next time!  Thanks Big Erns for a delicious ending to our West Coast vacation.  :)",

    "text": "Well, it's in the CONTAINER park. So, like every store there, it's on the smaller side of things. I can see seating being a problem during the evenings and colder months, but anytime it's 60+ outside, the outdoor seating is more than adequate. I imagine the size also keeps the menu items at a minimum.   Walking in you're hit with that signature smoked bbq scent, which should be sold as a candle scent bc I want to be around it at all times. 'Pork' by Calvin Klein. 'Burnt Ends' by Yankee Candle. Sign me up! The menu isn't large, but covers most of the bases. Pulled pork, chicken, brisket, ribs n hot links with a number of sides. Seeing as they were pulling meat from a freshly smoked pork shoulder as I walked in, I opted for the pulled pork sandwich with a side of slaw and a Fat Tire. Total came to $15. The meal ended up being great! The pulled pork was moist and had a hint of that smokey goodness. The accompanying bbq sawse was good and gets you through any of the larger, drier portions of the meat. I wish there was a spicy version though. There were two bottles sauce to choose from , so maybe there is, but they weren't labeled, so maybe there isn't. Who knows?! The slaw was solid too. Large chunks of cabbage and more of a vinegar base than a mayo drowning, which is always appreciated.   While I'm going to eat my way around the park before I head back to try more of the menu, I will be back 100%. Any bbq fan that understands the limits of a restaurant in a container park is sure to be satisfied from the offerings of Big Ern.",

    "text": "The reviews for Big Ern's seem to run (literally) hot and cold. I noted this on my handy dandy Yelp app, but also saw that the reviews for their previous pop-up location nearby were much better so I decided to give them a try. I'm glad I did - this was some pretty darn good BBQ.  I went for a three meat combo - I picked brisket, pulled pork, and hot links - which served with 2 sides. I went with Mac-n-Cheese and baked beans for the sides. I saw a lot of complaints about the price, but the $14.99 price tag on this platter is on par with the BBQ places I am familiar with in the DC-area, and the portion size was ample. (See photo)  Here's how I would breakdown the meal:  Outstanding: The brisket and the hot links. The beef brisket is among the best I have ever had. It was very juicy with the right level of smoke flavor. Not too smoky, not too bland. And the hot links were equally yummy ... a nice hint of heat, but not overpowering, and a great texture and flavor to the link.  Good: The sauce, the roll, and the beans. They only have one kind of sauce, and it's a sauce on the sweeter side, but not overly sweet like a KC style sauce. It has a nice balance of sweet and tangy. And the roll was very nice. (Both were much needed for the pulled pork.) The baked beans were good ... they may be canned beans as noted by another review, but they were cooked nicely with a nice blend of green pepper and onion with it. Nothing special, but they were tasty.  Meh: The pulled pork and mac-n-cheese. The pulled pork was surprisingly bland. There just wasn't much flavor with it at all. On a positive note, when placed on the bun with their house BBQ sauce, it went down nicely. But good pulled pork should stand alone, and this didn't. The mac-n-cheese reminded me of what my mom used to make. That's not a good thing, because my brother and I disliked it so much that we begged mom for Kraft instead. It's homemade, but it's basically taking block cheese and melting it with macaroni ... the oil from the cheese separates and makes it a bit of a mess.  And don't worry, you can get your beer on here too. None of the local craft brews that the other places in Container Park offer, but they stick to the hipster theme of their location, offering Fat Tire and PBR. (Yes, PBR has become THE hipster \"common\" brew) I hadn't had a PBR in a while, and enjoyed it with my BBQ.   With more hits than misses, I'll give Big Ern's a solid 4 stars ... I'd definitely come back again for the brisket and the hot links.",

    "text": "Let me say this first I only got to try 1/2 lb of brisket at Big Ern's today but I am looking foward to my next stop in here. I would have ordered more but this was my second BBQ stop in an hour and was not expecting to cross paths with the place.   I ordered 1/2 lb of brisket I did ask for it to be .25 moist and .25 lean. I didn't get that but what I did get was the best brisket I have had in Vegas. I seemed to only get the brisket from the moist cut. No lean was to be found on my plate. As well the 1st plate came out with sauce. Yikes such a no no. They replaced it and we go from there. The 1st taste was really good. I have had better else where but not in Vegas. I will say am not sure they are trimming the briskets correctly though. Even though the taste is there and the smoke ring. It was lacking a great bark and it had a lot of fat the should have been trimmed. With my knowlegde of brisket I am pretty sure this was not trimmed down enough. Either that or the smoker they are using is not rendering down the fat enough. I will be back and look foward to trying more things at Big Ern's. Maybe even bump this up to a 4 on a rereview.  Didn't want to do complete update. It is staying a 3 lack of bark and to much fat. Best brisket in Vegas but that is not hard to do. For the ribs they are really good prob the best I have had in Vegas as well. The side, well just stay away from them. The mac is dry and lacks everything and the bbq beans well just wasn't a fan.   Just make sure to order without sauce or they will cover it.",

Tough. Dry. And even sliced with the meats grain lenght. Don't get me wrong. Crossed sliced would'nt help this very much. Two different Cows. Guess one was young adult. The other Cow was 100 years old. So Sad. 60% of Rib Slab was Magnificent. The rest was leaning dry. Must have gotten this rib from TWO Pigs. One was Grandma. Pulled Pork was 3.75+ stars. Honestly the batch might have been cooked yesterday. And reHeated for this evening. With their two type Wonderful BBQ sauces... left overs next day should be OK for sandwhiches. That tough Brisket may need to be Double Chopped for Sandwhiche use. Links should be Yummy as Overnight Treat with some great toasted Bun. Part of the tougher Ribs overnight should be Chewable with some effort.  Some our Dinner was 4.5-5 stars. Some was 1-2 stars. We ordered no Sides. Based on Yelp Foodies warning.  Total rating. I hate to do this. 3 stars as conservative. Largely because $10 of the Brisket should not have veen served to Us. Whether cut across the grain or not.  We can't risk going back. $20 part of our $65 purchase was MEH. IF thats OK for Yelpers... Go eat here. If not. Take wisdom from 3 stars Yelp Reviews here.  But then again. On Fremont street one can Blow Multiple $20's in hour or less. Actually so many Eateries here... why not Enjoy $65 on many their Other Offering under the streets Long Light Show. Sad. Are We. It could have been a 5 stars review. And Many Many Many return VISITS.  Damn it. Brisket is Beef. It could have been smoked medium rare and be served Ok. Even reHeated and served and won't be Tough. Why cook it to near well done. Lots Yelp'Rs here posted this. With words like Jerky. Dry.  Posted is picture of dry'ish Brisket not Craved against the meat strain Crain",

They have brisket, chicken, ribs, pulled pork, and hot links. My husband and I decided to split the 2 meat and 2 side combo and chose brisket and hot links for our meat and the mac & cheese and potato salad for our sides. Let me tell you, I wanted to shove him out of the way and totally not share. It was that good! The brisket was perfectly cooked and so tender. The hot links had just the right amount of kick to them. The spice was flavorful and not overpowering.They also had a perfect blend to their BBQ sauce; not to spicy, not to sweet. Loved it! The sides were ok, but I would try their BBQ beans and maybe the coleslaw next time. The potato salad looked more like mashed potatoes and lacked flavor and the mac & cheese was good just not that great. Don't get me wrong, it wasn't awful by any means, just not fantastic.   There is limited seating out front and inside, but if you are willing to walk upstairs there are loads of seating and excellent people watching. I would like to go back to Big Ern's and purchase some of their meat by the pound and bring home some messy, messy ribs! If you're in Container Park make sure you hit up this place!",

    "text": "First off, this place doesn't serve potatoes as a side.  That's a complete \"f#ck you\" to BBQ connoisseurs.  What kind of BBQ joint doesn't have a choice of french fries, baked potato, mashed potatoes or even just plain potato chips?  Potato SALAD?  Yeah, I'll have that with a side of diarrhea, please.  Disgusting.  Okay, well, first of all, don't believe the reviews.  I came here because it was recommended to me by Yelp!  Never again.  This place was an annoyance to get to, if you're familiar with downtown Las Vegas; it's right off Fremont Street at the aptly named Container Park.  What that means is that you'll be parking blocks away, feeding a meter, and then walking to your destination, rain or shine.  So I finally convinced myself to go.  I was feeling suicidal, which only leaves you two options: kill yourself, or get something good to eat.  I chose the latter this time.  I expected this to perk up my spirits, just a day before Lonely Christmas, but read on, fellow Yelpers...  After going out of my way to stalk this place, and in less than bitter spirits, I chose the three-meat combo in order to get it all out of the way; that's right, pulled pork, beef brisket and \"ribs.\"  Just \"ribs.\"  I had no idea what I was in for.  Paid the $15 (oh, did I mention I'm unemployed?) for the combo, in addition to the $1 in the meter (which I include in the bill, for the inconvenience).  Food came quickly; the line wasn't too bad.  Here's a round-up of the eats:  1) Pulled pork - the best part of the plate.  Stringy.  Cold.  But edible.  Pour a bunch of extra BBQ sauce on it because it is DRY.  2) Beef brisket - Hard.  Chewy.  You're forced to chew it for 5 minutes, then eventually swallow when you're tired of chewing.  This stuff was TERRIBLE.  Not recommended at all.  3) \"Ribs\" - NOT MEANT FOR HUMAN CONSUMPTION.  I don't even know what part of the pig this was.  The tendons?  It was not even remotely chewable.  I attempted to eat half of one, then asked for a to-go box for the remainder of the brisket and ribs.  I've never done that before.  Usually I finish it all in one go.  And that's not a compliment regarding the portions.  The combo also came with a \"roll.\"  I.E. Half a hamburger bun.  Yes, you read that right.  Half a f#cking hamburger bun.  Merry f#cking Christmas.  My dog will eat well tonight.",

For my two sides (included) I chose Mac-n-cheeses and pork-n-beans. It was all excellent especially the Mac-n-cheese and the brisket . One thing I like is they give you a lot of sauce. I personally just didn't love the flavor of the sauce. It was good, but not great. But the meats were excellent as were the sides. I will definitely come back!",

I also disliked how they only had two bottles of bbq for everyone to share. I had to go to different tables because people would be hogging it. Wouldn't hurt for you guys to invest in more sauce bottles or at least a sauce dispenser so customers don't end up hogging the sauce.",

You can almost add more meat for an extra $5 dollars which I would suggest if you go for dinner. The ribs where fall off the bone good but you could also brings them up to eat them. The Mac and cheese was really good and creaming. Which was the best part, since I've been in Vegas I've been looking for food mac and cheese and I finally found it. My cousin for the hot link sandwich with beans at first, and let me add it isn't baked beans, more like a mean soup. She replaced it with the potato salad which was amazing as well. All and all it was a great place for lunch.",

Fries were good and had some extra seasoning, they also have a spicy bbq sauce which was good. However, there are some improvements that could be made. It is very small inside and the manager was taking up a table doing his work/schedule which was inconvenient since there weren't very many areas to sit and enjoy your food considering it is very cold outside. The eating area was also a mess. I had to wipe down the table we used since left over crumbs and napkins scattered. The cashier was new and could not figure out how to pour a beer, she poured out 2 cups because of too much foam. As we were eating she had to constantly ask her manager for assistance with customers at checkout. I will definitely come back if I'm in Fremont but probably take my food to-go.",

This past weekend, Hubby bought us tickets to Wines Around The World happening at the park this past weekend. Heat and alcohol tends to provide a faster buzz so we needed to eat. It was early so Big Ern's wasn't crowed yet so we decided to try it. First, the music was my kind of jams! Old school R&B and I was singing, snapping fingers and grooving! Hubby and I both got hot links! YUM!!! The Mac & Cheese was similar to mine and Hubby went back and ordered sliced brisket which was DELISH!!! We will definitely return!!!",

    "text": "First of all, if you're in the Downtown Las Vegas area, you need to head over to Container Park just to experience it. That, alone, is a great reason to visit Big Ern's.  Just like every other business at the park, this restaurant is installed in an old shipping container, which limits its size, but increases its novelty.  But you probably want to hear about the food. It's reasonably priced. Each meat plate is $10 for 5oz of meat, 1 side, and bread. Pretty good. And if you want an additional 5oz, you just pay an extra $5. It's a good deal if you want to try one of their sides. Otherwise, it's $17 for a pound of brisket.  The brisket itself was extremely tender. And with little fat on it, too--increasing the amount of actual edible meat you get. At first, I was curious why they just gave me a fork and no knife, but I soon realized the knife wasn't needed. You can cut right through it like fish (that is, if you're not already eating it with your hands).   In fact, this meat would be at the top of my list if it weren't for the lack of distinct flavor--even if it had just a little. But pre-sauce, this meat had basically none. It's hard not giving it more points.  It's a good thing the sauce was tasty enough. It would've been a shame if it wasn't. While not the best, it definitely did the job in not making the meat quality be in vain. The sauce was harder to put my finger on. The cook in the back said it's \"California style,\" but I concluded it was more similar to Texas. But a little thicker than normal, and with a higher amount of sweetness. Almost Pepsi-nuanced. Maybe you could call it a peppery California sauce.  The baked beans were just okay, but if you add a little (or a lot) of BBQ sauce, they turn into something pretty good. The mac & cheese was my favorite of the sides. They were made with real cheese and had a comforting homemade feel. And they weren't too cheesy.  I have a weird thing for BBQ places that don't have cornbread, but at least they give you a dinner roll with each plate.  I would definitely come back to Big Ern's. If nothing else but as an excuse to visit the underappreciated Container Park. But it's reasonably priced for what you get--quality and all.",

We both wanted beans since they didn't have mac & cheese.  The brisket was very good!! Good crust. Tender. Smoked well. Could taste the smoke thru the BBQ sauce. The links were good too. Good snap on the skin. A nice lil spice to um. The baked beans were awesome!! Loved the pulled pork in the beans. And they weren't too sweet. But I expected more food. I would've gave um at least 4 stars, but I expected a little more food for $12. The cashier seen me & my chic were going to share a combo and she didn't even try to upsell us to a 3 meat combo. And I still wish I had more meat as I'm posting this review. Overall, Big Ern's is a little more meat away from being my 2nd favorite BBQ spot in Vegas. But the food was exceptionally good!",

The pricing was a bit more than I like to pay for, but I understand... its how it is downtown for a reason. But enough about the cost.  Mac and cheese- I heard was good, but the one I had was not that tasty.  Brisket- flavorful and a good portion by the way  When I tried the brisket with some of there sauce it gave it that extra kick that I like when eating bbq.

Later the worker told me that they don't have a toaster to warm the buns but if I want the buns warm next time, I could ask them to put them on the warmer for me. I probably won't try their pulled pork again, maybe their brisket next time.",

When walking into the Park it is a short stroll off to the right hand side on the main level.  I've been here a few times while visiting the container park with family and friends. The ribs, Mac n cheese are my usual but I've been told the brisket isn't so bad.   The BBQ here overall is not  to bad, it isn't the best in town, but not bad for the location and general access to hearty meal. They also offer a few beers on tap which is a nice touch to wash down your BBQ. Like all the container park restaurants they use the biodegradable silverware and plates which is a nice touch.  Usually I have found a lot of the times coming here, it can be a painfully long line and once you have your meal, the seating area is quite limited in the actual container. Outside seating is is also offered but usually takin up by someone watching the main jungle gym.  Overall  Service: 3-5 Cleanliness: 4-5 Food: 3-5 Back again: Yup, but because of the container park",

    "text": "My husband and I crave good smoked BBQ, and recently moved to Vegas. We ordered the 3 meat plate which comes with two sides. The sides were typical and somewhat boring. I was frustrated because they also serve fancier sides like fried okra, and I think they call them \"bites\" but you are not allowed to choose any of \"those\" as your side. Our meal came out and the gentleman was very nice. The mac n cheese was a small portion and the sweet potato fries needed salt, which was not found at the table.  We tried the meats: hot link, brisket and rib tips. The hot link was fine, tasted like one I could buy at the store and microwave. The rib tips were \"fine\", not hard but not soft and no flavor, and the brisket was basically 50% fat. The fat was so bad that it has a half dollar size chunk all the way through every peice-it reminded me of a tumor. None of the meat had a smoke ring, in fact walking up and into the store there wasn't even the faintest smell of smoke! The only flavor on the meat came from the BBQ sauce they poured on top of all 3 meats....that's right, no sauce options available. One sauce, over everything.   The photo below shows the meal as it came out and then also shows fat and bones that remained from our small portion of brisket and rib tips. We were very under whelmed and will not be back.   I gave this place 2 stars because the food was edible, just not good. The service wasn't awful, just nothing about this place stands out.",

Didn't happen. They said they would get them out to me. I had time to take my kiddo to the restroom and walk back - still wasn't ready.   They take way too long for a counter service establishment. Try somewhere else.",

I ordered my usual pulled pork sandwich with cold slaw, and I am never disappointed by the quality and flavors that my sandwich offers. The pulled pork is soft, well marinated, and juicy!   Just a quick tip: anytime you order from there, always grab a few of those mini-cups of their homemade BBQ sauce. It's delicious on any of their dishes.   I definitely recommend going here if ur out on Freemont and looking for something new to try. Even if it's not your first time, I still recommend going!",

The meat doesn't have that deep smoke flavor I expect from quality bbq. The bark is bland and the sauce is generic. The sides always taste microwaved and like most bbq it isn't terribly cheap.   The service is usually good which is the saving grace of this place, especially considering the bevy of food options nearby.  It's serviceable bbq, but there is better to be found. Maybe not here in Las Vegas, but I have a higher expectation of BBQ and this just doesn't hit it.",

I understand barbecue takes time, hours and hours in fact. But as long as there are places in this world like Franklin Barbecue in Austin, TX, where Mr. Franklin smokes his brisket for 16 hours before serving, not one single place in this town is going to get a break with their \"how do I get this done quickly?\" methods.  Now listen, I really like Big Ern. I have met the man and he is a genuinely nice man. I will honestly say that I think he does put a lot of heart into his cooking. His barbeque is pretty good, and I have stopped in on several occasions.   I will say that when it comes to barbeque, Big Ern is kicking everybody's but here in Vegas. I love you for that Big Ern - I really do, but your just not there yet.

Don't take away side choices, improve them!  Choices are now just baked beans (tasted canned), coleslaw (too much mayo), a bag of chips, or a baked potato. $2 each with the purchase of a sandwich, 2 included in the cost of most plates. No thanks.  -1 So. Much. Grease. I know barbecue isn't health food, but my order shouldn't be sitting in a puddle of grease. I literally dropped my chopped brisket sandwich because the bun was so slick. Gross! -1 The barbecue sauce pump is empty at 1PM. Now I know y'all ain't had so much business that it all got eaten in a few hours. This should be checked daily before you even open.  -1 No flavor, aside from grease and sauce. The brisket had great fall-apart texture and (more than) enough fat, but if you tried a bite without sauce it was bland.  -1 It's 105 degrees outside and the cashier makes no mention of beverages? At the very least, a cup of water should be standard.  The $9 sandwiches are a good portion size, but the price is irrelevant if the product isn't appealing enough to finish. Also, this is the first place I've ever been that doesn't offer sliced pickles and onions to garnish your brisket sandwich.",

I only got the rib tips and Mac and cheese (which the cashier recommended) but I was fairly impressed. I did only give the 4 stars because I didn't try more items to give a over all review and although the rib tips were tasty it failed to have that crisp charbroil crunch that you'd expect. But I'd try again for sure especially since it's located in a great location of container park.",

They have PBR and Fat Tire on tap. I was more than happy to see Fat Tire. PBR must be for the lost hipsters that stumbled out of the Fremont Experience. Someone please put a barricade up.  Now onto the food! The brisket was fork tender because I wasn't given a knife but it was tender enough I really didn't need a knife. Saving the environment one tender brisket piece at a time.  The pulled pork was tender but the star was really the brisket. It had a nice smoke ring and plenty of smokiness. I also liked that they didn't kill it with sauce and let the meat speak for itself.   The hubs finished off the cole slaw. My five year old stole my chips. The roll was meh, but I was happy with the quantity and quality of the brisket.   Immediately after I ordered I noticed they have rib tips, this is on my to do list for next time.",

    "text": "I come to Big Erns probably twice a week because I live downtown. I even recommend this place and I often bring family and friends here. If I chose to stay in, I will usually order my favorites through postmates. Today, I decided to stop in before heading back to my office and received the absolute worst customer service in the 7 months of coming here. I saw new faces today, perhaps that was reasoning for subpar service.   I noticed that their menu changed to a bright collage of poorly written letters from their previous printed menu. But noticed a few new things, like the chocolate raspberry bundt cake! Looked amazing. Wished I had tried it. I ordered my usual Brisket and Fries. The brisket loaded potato is also my favorite! But Brisket and fries. Oh and the cashier talked me into the cake. So I'm waiting for about 5 mins or so and the manager comes over to tell me that someone forgot to turn on the fry machine this morning (it's 12:30p right now) and he can't make fries. Kinda bummed out because they have decent seasoned fries. Don't get me wrong. I love the food. Not always consistent unless Gary and the lovely Hispanic cashier (forgot your name, I'm sorry) are working and that's when it seems like everything is quick and tastes like BBQ should taste!  So I tell the manager I don't really want anything other than fries and asked for maybe a lil more meat. He couldn't do that. I understood and was like I guess I'll just get a refund. The cashier who initially appeared warm and friendly says \"dude it's over fries!\" Not the point lady... it's 2 hours after opening during lunch hours on a Wednesday and you don't know your equipment isn't on? Just give me my money back. There's a heated exchange where she was reminded that I'm a paying customer, paying for a service that you are supposed to deliver, when you fail to meet those simple expectations I am well within my right to request to have my money returned for services undelivered. It is not your place to question my food choices or berate me with why you're selling fries and I'm purchasing them. Remember that.   The manager, still very pleasant, urges this uncontrollable child to stop talking and she proves to be even more hostile while arguing about my refund not to mention insubordinate to what seemed to be a reasonable manager. She argues with me about not being able to give me a receipt showing that my credit card was refunded. Again manager steps in and does his job, not so effective but he tried. After she shoves the receipt at me, I've had it and decided that it's just best to never visit this establishment again and Start walking out. She again proves her lack of decorum and professionalism as should boldly protests that I should leave. Cute... I'm already walking out the door.    Unfortunate to have lost my continuos patronage. Food is pretty decent. Almost Southern. Reminded me of home in North Carolina, now for more than just the food, unfortunately",

The rest was pretty average- the pulled pork had great flavor but was a bit on the dry side. Nice bbq sauce too.   Downsides- out of brisket at 8:30. I just watched a large group walk out the door that would have been good for at least $150 because they were out of items, and the fryer was shut down for the night! With so many fried items on the menu and such great okra, why would you turn the fryer off 2 hours before closing time!? That's how you go out of business.....",

The food was good, as much as you'd expect. It hits the spot. My roll was slightly stale but my husband said his was fine so maybe a fluke.   We had the brisket, mac and cheese, and bbq chili. Everything was tasty. The Mac and cheese wasn't the best but I've paid for much worse. I only wish they had more sauce choices.   Decor was the usual faux shack bbq place feel. So it's fine unless you're snobby.   If you check in they'll give you a free side too, so not a bad deal.",

Their pulled pork ranks right up there with my other favorite BBQ places.  Their BBQ sauce is very good as well.  I wasn't impressed with the beans as I tend to go for the baked beans with the sweet taste.  Not saying it isn't good but something I've never experienced in a BBQ joint.

I had the brisket with two ribs and a baked potato along with BBQ baked beans. The food looked great and tasted even better. The sauce was perfect...I could certainly taste the vinegar but it wasn't overly sweet. And the BBQ baked beans... So good they should be illegal.

I look over the menu and order the brisket and rib platter, to find out they were out of everything except pulled pork - including potatoes and even ice. But I understand that sometimes BBQ places run out of meat - you can't simply make more of something that takes 12+ hours to cook if you had a busier than expected day. The cashier and cook were friendly and I ordered my sandwich.  It was supposed to be slow-smoked, but it tasted like... nothing - as if a pork butt was boiled for hours in plain water then pulled. There wasn't even any bark or spices to give any kind of flavor. It seemed like it was cooked too long so the texture was getting a little mushy. The BBQ sauce was good but nothing special. They used a high quality bun and had pretty good beer prices. It wasn't terrible, it just tasted like bbq sauce on a bun. I finished it and then went somewhere else as I was still hungry without a side option.  I don't know if they just had an off day, but the meal I had definitely wasn't worth going back for.  I hope they figure it out because it's a great location with a lot of potential and friendly staff.",

    "text": "After seeing Big Erns being chosen Best of Las Vegas, the wife and I decided to give it a try.  We got there shortly after opening figuring the food would be at it's freshest.  My wife ordered the pulled pork sandwich and I had the chopped brisket sandwich.  We both had a bag a chips as our side, wanting to keep it simple, and a sweet iced tea.    I'll start off with the sides, way over priced.  The bag of chips was $2 extra and amounted to the same chips you can get for about .75 in most convenience store, definitely not worth the money.  The sweet tea was quite good, not too sweet, though the serving sizes could have been bigger.  They also don't offer refills which would be nice, especially since chips are $2,00.  The sandwiches both had a good portion of meat and very little sauce, which I prefer.  If I want extra I'll add it.  There is nothing worse than a place that covers the meat in sauce to cover the taste of lousy bbq.  The brisket was moist and had a good flavor, not too much smoke.  The pulled pork on the other hand was rather bland.  It had no smoke flavor and there was no taste of the rub either.  I also found it odd that there was no bark on my wife's sandwich.    How it got voted Best of Las Vegas is beyond me.  It's not that it was terrible, it was just average.   I would probably go back, but would order the meal instead of the sandwich.  For the same price as the sandwich and chips, you get two sides.",

I would say Famous Daves and Memphis (heck even Dickeys) would get my vote over this place. The servings were small, the food was dry, the flavor was not of high quality, and the gentleman who I am guessing is the owner just sat at a booth counting his money (literally) and ordered his employees around. He was very nice and gave my son a little toy but that doesn't change my views of the food.",

    "text": "I've eaten a lot of bbq to separate the good and the worst and Big Erns is definitely in the bottom of the list.  Before i do the cons I'll tell you the pros on my visit.  I just enjoyed the Brisket..  Cons... First and foremost, let's review the ribs... they were not moist and very chewy. There was only 4 pcs and I gave up on the 3rd one. A BBQ joint should always have good ribs. Second the pulled pork. That pork was so dry and chewy also; even L&L hawaiian bbq does a better job at it even at late hours!. The sauce is not evenly spread out.  A BBQ joint should have a good sauce and yes the sauce was good considering they only had one flavor that's comparable to the ones I buy at albertsons.  Next I had the pork and beans...i don't know why the people next to me was saying it's good when it clearly taste like the ones I use to buy at walmart. No special taste there. To be honest I use to buy it as dog food.  Also did the Potato salad....that was horrible even my kid pointed out it was bad. I also had him try the cup of water telling him it's refreshing. He's reaction?? x[ like that. lol and last the dinner roll. Smh..   For the price I'd recommend going to Famous Daves. They have a variety of sauces and the quality is always consistent.  I don't know if I went to Big Erns late but 5 pm there was still lots of people so there shouldn't be an excuse to serve it like that.  Also people should not always believe on over hyped places. Don't believe it till you try it cause most often it mind f***s u and u start to believe it's good. Believe in your taste buds ;)",

Priced fairly alright, but was hoping for more food for that price.  The food was out in less than 5. My gf and I shared a 3 meat combo. Ordered double order chicken and ribs and Mac and cheese since they had no fries!! One pbr and one bud light and paid $22.  Was expecting whole pieces of chicken instead I was eating shredded chicken. It was dry! BBQ sauce was good at least so I  poured it on the chicken. My ribs...well it was 3 pieces and had absolutely NO MEAT on them, and was chewy. I was licking the bone for some sort of substance but no luck.   The Mac and cheese. I'm not sure that they even put ANY cheese in there to make it but the butter ....boy did they use butter. It's obviously been sitting in their hot food trays all day long. Scooped into a small paper bowl at the bottom was a whole lot of butter!!!! Yuck. I want to see cheese, not oil.  Roll was dry but at that point the whole meal was dissapointing.  At least I had some beer. Won't be going back, you're better off at a chain BBQ joint in town for better cuts of meat.",

The night we were there they we're out of mac & cheese, bread pudding and potato salad, all BBQ place staples so how could one run out? My pulled pork sandwich was ok. Meat was tasty but dry. I had to drench it in the sauce they had out to use to get it down. Sweet potato fries were yummy and the piece of ribs I ate from my friends plate was well over cooked. Decor was cute but the tables were not clean and the lady at the counter definitely wasn't friendly. 3 stars is probably an over rating but I don't want to be an ass and who knows maybe they were just having a bad night. I'm not going back again to find out though.",

    "text": "This review is for the Fiesta rancho location. I am not seeing it listed as a location on Yelp as of this review.  I tried the brisket combo which comes with two sides along with a bread roll. The sides I chose were Jambalaya and the Collard Greens. As for the sides the greens were fantastic although very salty with a lot of juice at the bottom of the cup.. I personally like my greens like this, although many people would find it salty almost like a soup broth. The Jambalaya was honestly some of the most bland that I have ever tried and lacked anything that makes a good jambalaya good. The most important piece of the meal is the brisket which was served to me not in slices but rather in chunks.. Sort of like tuna fish..it was not melt in your mouth and honestly tasted much like cheap roast beef that would placed in like a soup or on some beef stroganoff. Absolutely one of the worst brisket dishes I have had from a BBQ restaurant. The bread was just a cheap dinner roll and nothing homemade. I will say that the hot bbq sauce is very good and probably my favorite condiment sauce I may have ever tried. Don't know if it's homemade or something like Sweet Baby Rey's or slaking those lines. My wife tried the loaded Potato Bomb and while it was 10 bucks.. I will say that the potato was huge and filled with toppings. I am not a potato fan but she said she loved it. Looked pretty impressive in size.   Overall if you are in the Las Vegas valley and are looking for great BBQ, go to either SNS DINER OR JOHN MULLS. make sure your put BIG ERN's at the bottom of the list.",

I was at container park for my race packet pick up and ordered a brisket & pork and 6 rib bones with a beer and wine.  Hefty price but it was good eating.  Really good rib bones might I add!     But when I went up to ask about our missing rolls I got the biggest attitude in the world and they were sure it was on our plates and can't do anything about it.  I was like wow, okay.  Not the biggest loss and I wasn't going to hold up a line stretched out the door.  Good food, but horrible under business pressure.  I'd come again",

When I got my order, I was worried that my ribs looked dry and was just covered with sauce. I was amazed the meat was tender and absolutely not dry at all.  However, the ribs were too smoky for my taste buds. I realize this may be  a preference to some people. I got helpings of both their spicy BBQ sauce and their original BBQ sauce. I personally wasn't crazy about the taste of the sauces. They do have a good number choices on their menu and I do plan to return and order the other meats they offer. Last but not least, the staff was friendly and very helpful with the menu choices.",

    "text": "I never really write reviews but in this case I have to be fair and do the right thing  I want this company to really take pride in there food and do better I really loved you guys even sent you clients your way. I waited all week for you all to have your app up and running was told over the phone last week that you all would be up and running on there Monday,. Because the last time order it was some of the best smoked bbq beef brisket I had in a long time and I wanted your food again. What the hell happened?!!!!!! I don't know if they were having an off day or who ever was in charge of cooking they need to season the food. I'm very upset and appalled. I have ordered from here numerous  times and this will be my last order ever.  Today I ordered through DoorDash my driver gets there and calls me to tell me that, the company refused to give them my food because they no longer dealt with DoorDash, okay that's fine but since my paid for and received order went  through ,  they should've given the food anyway. Then they should've called DoorDash to tell them to close there deliver app for them.    Red flag right there that shows you what kind of Integrity they don't posses  or at least whoever rejected my order in the first place. So afterward I call DoorDash to get them to get my order delivered. They got them to deliver Okay, Yes they honored the deliver  after I called but they didn't include a Im sorry Courtesy dessert or anything for me having to wait longer for doordash to resent a driver out to redeliver my order and rejecting my order In the first place .   I should've followed my first thoughts and order from some other BBQ place. The food is all baked at least mine was baked  and don't even get me started on the Mac and cheese . I hate when a company cuts corners and bakes there meat and then says it BBQ . Get the hell out of here with that BS!! I I can see them BBQ the food and then the last 10 minutes baking it to ensure it super tender. Plus the food had Absolutely   no salt whatsoever and hardly no BBQ sauce on my food. What I got was a small drizzles of sauce over food.  I'm not one to add addition salt to my food very often. I hate to have to leave a harsh review but I'm pissed off!! Paid good money for a 1b of beef brisket and a bbq rib meal only to wish I had not ordered at all. You all really need to season your food better and actually smoke/grill the food.",

    "text": "After walking by this place for well over a year today was the day I decided indulge.  I went on a mid afternoon stroll through the container park and none of the other places got me salivating like Big Ern's BBQ.  It was a quiet day at the Container Park and the rare desert  rain just stopped falling.   After looking over the menu and asking a few questions It looked like the pulled pork sandwich and side of pork and beans was the winning choice.    The food came out quickly and there was a very decent portion of meat on the bun.  The roll was very soft and fresh and the pork was very juicy and tender.  Big chunks of pork smothered in sauce with just the right amount of fat and bark to make a vegetarians mouth water.  I prefer my BBQ sauce to have a little more heat to it because this was made to cater to all tastes of BBQ lovers.  I did not even ask if other sauces were available because I was sooo hungry.  the pork and beans were very good and had come out scolding hot not like the pork sandwich which was luke warm. My beans had big chunks of meat and a little bit of spice.  I would go back for these for sure, after working my way around the menu.    The one down fall of this experience was the service.  I understand that this is a lazy rainy day at the CP.  All the more reason the operators have to go for it, this is the time to give that WOW! service everyone is looking for.  When I arrived both team members were in the dining room one on phone the other doing who knows what.  While trying to make conversation about the business the response most given was \" I don't know I am not the owner\".  A little turned off by this.  Then I had to ask about the rain several times and it was like no one was listening and then the answers were directed at me like I was a tourist.  Yeah turned off by this also.    I decided to sit outside and enjoy my meal in solitude while watching the rain fall.  Very relaxing and boy I needed that after the weekend I had.  I am giving the 4 stars for the food and 3 stars for the mediocre service.  I will be back to try the Ribs and the Brisket.",

The employed told me that they were much better now, and K asked specifically if he would make sure of that for me. He \"did\" and yet I still had to throw most of my meal, because it was completely fatty rib tips. I will never order from there again, because that's the ONLY thing I wanted.

The ribs were sinewy and small, and our fries didn't come until 20 minutes after ordering. By this time, we really didn't want the fries at all.  I asked about the confusing sign. They're apparently in the middle of updating it. If they're aware of the problems  with the sign, the clerk should've helped me with the order.

My friend and I opted to share a platter, with ribs, pulled pork and hot links. We also got a side of mac and cheese. The links weren't particularly spicy. The ribs and the pulled pork were both tender, but it seemed like it was missing flavor. It really needed the BBQ sauce to add enough flavor. The BBQ sauce was actually pretty good. The mac was cheesy, but not particularly memorable.  The restaurant is barebones. There were a few tables, but it was pretty empty on a weekday evening.",

I ordered the pulled pork platter with a side of collared greens and pork and beans. My wife and friend ordered the brisket which was also an excellent choice... It was so moist!   Their biscuits are perfectly soft and melt in your mouth but also work well to pick up the extra BBQ sauce from your plate lol! My mouth is watering as I write this review!   I can't wait to get back for sure when in the area...   Just wasn't able to get a refill on our drinks because there was only one person working the register and soda machine... Damn.    Next time I'll try something new. I'm sure it will be good.  Give this a place a try when you're in the area.",

My ribs seemed to start out well, but as I went through they became more and more covered with fat. I know that may appeal to some, but not to me.  I had the coleslaw, which wasn't bad, but wasn't great either. You can get fried okra here, though, and even though I didn't have it, it sounded like it was good from the reports of others.  You order by the number of meats you want, and then add your sides. Simple and effective process.  Very tiny place, so keep that in mind if you're looking to dine in.",

For a restaurant at Container Park they had quite a few tables for diners.   My husband and I split a meal since we were planning to try some other food spots in the area afterwards. We decided on the two rib and pulled pork combination with collard greens and potato salad. I liked the flavor of the ribs, but it wasn't as tender as most BBQ. The pulled pork was also good with BBQ sauce. I guess the theme of the meat was good, but not mind blowing. The collard greens were tasty and had a kick to them. They were definitely a unique twist on the typical collard greens. The potato salad was great, my husband and I agreed that we really liked this side. The roll on the side was boring and being from the south my husband commented that he wished they had gone with cornbread.   The price was very reasonable for BBQ and the service was good. We liked our food, but wouldn't go as far as to say it's the best BBQ in Las Vegas.",

I am really trying to support some of the local eateries downtown but it's really hard when some of the food is not very good.   Let me start of by saying the service was good, the cashier was funny and friendly, the cook looked like he was happy to be there, and the place looked to be a nice place to stop into after a couple drinks at one of the bars in Container Park. But that's about where it ends.  We ordered the ribs, hot links, pulled pork sandwich, macaroni and cheese, and potato salad. Let me sum it up quick because you don't need to read a novel:  The pulled pork sandwich was actually pretty good with the bbq sauce.  The hot link had a decent kick to it but was a little full of gristle and was alright.  The mac and cheese was greasy but dry and flavored with salt and water (weird). The potato salad wasn't bad but I have a feeling it's probably going to look about the same on the way out. The ribs were an epic fail. How are these chewy, gristly, tough stubs ribs? What animal did you take these from? I'm not even sure McDonald's would use that rib meat for their McRib.   I like to give places the benefit of the doubt so maybe some day I'll give it another shot...and probably after a couple shots. But I hope they pull it together because a \"good\" bbq spot on Fremont would be clutch.",

It was not busy at all, so I highly doubted it. She asked the cook about our order and he took his time finishing washing a pan before looking for my ticket and when he couldn't find it, asked me if I had a receipt. The cashier stepped in and showed him something and then turned to me and said \"He's making your food now\".  I'm irritated, but whatever, mistakes happen. I asked the cashier for a free side for making us wait for so long and the cook said no. He said the ticket just didn't print....as if that's not the restaurant's mistake. Then he asked me where we had been sitting and said he couldn't see us on the patio. I asked what difference that made if he didn't make or call out our order anyway. Now I'm getting mad because he's being openly rude and acting like any of this is my fault somehow and has not once apologized for the long wait or losing my order.  I tell the cashier that at this point I'd rather just have my money back because I just want to leave. The cook finally brings over two pitiful looking sandwiches as I'm trying to get a refund and I tell him he can keep them and I just want my money back. The cook of course gives me attitude about that. The cashier claimed she was new, but somehow quickly figured out how to do a refund....My guess is she has a lot of practice at it. We took our money next door to Bin 702 where we ordered food from a friendly bartender, our order was actually made, the food was great, and we lived happily ever after.   Customer service is the face of a restaurant and with SO many restaurant options in Las Vegas with friendly, competent staff I see no reason to ever try Big Ern's again.",

    "text": "Finally got a chance to try this Friday after work. By the time I got there (10:30) they were out of all the meats except the pulled pork and hot links, but I like both so I went with the 2-meat combo. The hot links were great, and the pulled pork was tasty. The only bummer was the sides: the baked beans with pulled pork had big chucks of raw onion in them (maybe I'm in the minority here, but I hate raw onion), and the mac n cheese was no bueno.   I will say this: the service was excellent, and the sauce is very good. I'm probably going to post a follow-up review once I can try the other meats.",

I enjoyed both the ribs and brisket, but the pulled pork was dry and tasteless. I would pass on that item on the menu. BBQ bake beans were awesome, but the Mac & Cheese weren't up to par. They didn't have enough cheese and the pasta used make it chewy. Maybe the pasta was undercooked..... Free refill on drinks, but if there is a long line at the counter don't even bother trying to get a refill.   Big side note about seating!! Space is limited inside and there are seats outside. We were originally gonna sit outside but then I noticed above your head is where people are walking and there are holes on the flooring above. If you mind dirt and other god awful things on people's shoes DO NOT SIT ON THE PATIO.   Overall it was decent.",

    "text": "It seems as though this is the most popular spot to eat at Container Park. There is usually a line of at least 3 to 4 people and can go long enough to be out the door. I ordered brisket with slaw and beans. The menu is very minimal, but that's fine with me because more is less right? My sides were okay, but unfortunately not good enough for me to order the same sides again the next time I come. My brisket was good, but a little dry and needed more flavor. So I definitely added more sauce to it. I think the food deserves 3 stars but the ambiance and service constitutes the overall 4 star rating. Although the inside seating area is rather small, I still like the country vibe of the place.  The price is also pretty reasonable and eating a meal at Container Park seems like the thing to do when you're there. I will definitely give them another shot, since the other meat options on the menu sound/look good.",

The ribs were tough nothing about falling off the bone here it's more like hold on to the meat with your teeth and pull hard just to get it off.

The pulled chicken was surprisingly not dry & equally yummy.  Now for the sides...the pork & beans had too much of a tomato base & the coleslaw needed way more dressing.  The sweet tea was good, it attracted all those dang bees swarming around us as we ate.  I highly recommend eating on their little patio area rather than on the tables along the shrubs out front, unless you're a bee aficionado!  Our lunch total came to about $24, not bad.",

If it weren't for the HORRIBLE attitude of some of the staff, I wouldn't even be commenting. My husband saw an employee behind the food line DOUBLE DIP HER EATING SPOON IN THE PUBLIC MAC AND CHEESE. After my husband said something they removed the macaroni in question.  The employee that was taking my order even suggested that the trash be checked for  another spoon. That sounded reasonable. There could've been a chance that she was not double dipping into public food.  No second spoon was produced!  We didn't expect to eat for free or anything of that sort. We just wanted to feel like our patronage was important and that this issue would be dealt with swiftly and properly. Their treatment of us that followed is what affected my rating of them. A few employees stood behind the food line stealing glances at our family and shaking their heads.   My husband doesnt like confrontation so for him to say something, the incident had to be really bad. A Big Ern BBQ employee that hadn't been present for the incident asked if everything was ok. My husband walked over and told him exactly what happened; That he watched an employee dip a plastic spoon into the macaroni and cheese that was being served to the public, ate off of that spoon and instead of throwing that spoon away and getting another plastic spoon she dug the SAME spoon that was just IN HER MOUTH, into the macaroni and cheese and took another bite. The lady that was running the cash register walked over to my husband and started yelling at him that the situation was over. That they took the food off of the line and that was that. The employee that did the double dipping said my husband was lying.   Never have we felt so disrespected and unappreciated! It really is a shame. The  macaroni and cheese was delicious. It rivaled my mom's homemade macaroni. To bad all of that was overshadowed by the  blatant disregard for proper customer service and disgusting food service standards.",

Every meat seemed to be styled from a different city (Kansas City brisket, Memphis pulled pork, St.louis ribs, etc.) so the place really didn't have it's own identity. The sides looked good but really lacked flavor. For example, the potato salad looked fabulous but really didn't taste like anything; the macaroni and cheese tasted like butter I guess. The biggest problem was the way they presented the meat. I ordered a three meat plate and they poured sauce on everything (NOT a good sign) and basically scrunched all three meats into a bowl. The brisket was thin and chewy, basically no smoked flavor. It also had cracks in it, so I guess they don't cut to order (either that are they are really doing something wrong). The ribs looked promising, but again they were chewy and no smoked flavor. The pork had slightly more flavor and the texture seemed right but the sauce was inappropriate (pulled pork typically has a thin vinegar sauce on the side, not BBQ sauce on top). Honestly, I didn't finish it and as much as I hate to waste food I threw at least half of it away.",

    "text": "We strolled Fremont Street and happily welcomed the little oasis of Container Park! We were all hungry and came upon Big Erns BBQ. Small (I mean come on you're in a container!) Quaint, clean and the friendliest staff. From bread to brisket to mac and cheese and pulled pork all four of our meals were excellent. We'd definitely do it again if in town. Prices were also a nice relief from the highway robbery of Vegas pricing.",

    "text": "First visit to the Container Park and I was surprised. I didn't even feel like I was downtown (except when I was walking in or leaving) but once inside it was really fantastic. The BBQ was tender and not dry. The sauce was pretty good. The potato salad was a bit bland but all in all a nice BBQ lunch in a pretty cool setting. Think I'll bring the family down one day to try it all again.",
