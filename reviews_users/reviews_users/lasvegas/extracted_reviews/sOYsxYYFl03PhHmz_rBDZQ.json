We are celebrating a birthday party and only half of the table go to order their food :( I decided on the crab & spinach dip as an appetizer and it was okay. For my entree I got the Jambalaya and the rice was way too watery. My friend had the zucchini and those were delicious. Their happy hour was great and overall it was a good experience. Just wished the food was amazing.",

Definitely a great place for a birthday, small event or gathering.   We also drop in from time to time for lunch or dinner when we don't want to venture too far. The service is always top notch and the atmosphere is amazing! The bartenders and servers are extremely personable. Food is consistent, I wouldn't call any of the dishes the best I've ever had but I've also never been dissatisfied! My favorites are the portobello fries, the filet, the pork and beef sliders, grilled chicken wings, and atlantic salmon. This is definitely a local regular spot, as they tend to have a little bit of a crowd on the weekend evenings, especially in the bar area.",

    "text": "Sparkling is almost a week old and it stands to be a great restaurant.  The decor is a modern chic and very nicely done.  Whether you are coming in as a couple, a group of friends or even a large party, they have diferent size tables.  They also have a private dining area for up to 14.  Servers haven't had much training yet.  Rather a bit of ojt. Everyone was very friendly and helpful though.  The food was also pretty good.  To start,  appetizers: Definitely try the meatballs.  They are the bomb.  The pan seared gnocci was also good, but I would have preferred it with pancetta vs sausage.  On to entrees: my wife is very fond of braised ribs and these were good, but not as good as Roy's.   I had the jambalaya and it was ok, but was missing cayenne and andoille sausage.  It was a bit salty and and very tomatoish.  Nonetheless, I cleaned my plate.  Finally dessert:  The cheesecake is a must and the chocolate cake is good but rather heavy.  Overall, it was a very good meal and considering they are a week old, its safe to reason that they will continue to improve.  From the owners of. Oyshi Sushi,  this is a very different concept, but I do like it and I'm glad we have it in our southwest neighborhood.  We will be back!!!",

Didn't knock my socks off but definitely worth trying.   The only reason I didn't give 5 stars is bc the service is slow. We were sitting in the lounge area in the bar so perhaps they just need to get a server to cover that area rather than the bar tender.  I will definitely be back!",

We had the crab and spinach dip, Italian sausage and pesto linguini, and my husbanded opted for the pork chops, all which were so good I could have licked the plate had we made it at home! My only complaint and the only thing lacking was the service. Our server was extremely nice however we hardly saw him and the restaurant wasn't that busy. I felt like we spent more time waiting for our check than we did actually eating our appetizers and meals, and while we were eating no one ever came and asked if we were okay or needing anything. And for that we had to waste half of our crab and spinach dip due to not being able to ask for chips or more bread to dip in it. All in all we will definitely be back, but will definitely hope for more table attention!",

We were seated right away and were given water immediately. My husband and I don't get to go out often so we were taking our time and our server, Eric, never rushed us and kept checking until we decided. As I'm a nursing mother, my son had a dairy allergy so I have to be careful about what I eat. Eric made sure to double check the ingredients before putting my order in. Our food came out fast and hot. The sweet potato fries and calamari were cooked to perfection. My braised beef was so tender than it fell apart using only my fork. My husband got a shrimp and chicken pasta that was so big he had to get a box for half of it. My only complaint is the lighting was very bright...very very bright.",

We got the portobello mushroom fries, bacon-wrapped date meatballs, sliders, and 1/2 slab of ribs. Everything looked like the pictures and tasted really good, though not the best I've ever had. Would give 4.5 stars overall, but it's excellent for the mid-priced range, so I gave it 5 stars. It gets a bonus for the decor and chandelier too.",

They also have a nice bar area if you want to get your drink on. Anyways, I ordered a bunch of appetizers: calamari, bacon wrapped meatballs, pan seared scallops, and the bruschetta. Definitely try the meatballs and scallops! I just wish there were more varieties for entrees even though I was pretty content with the amount of appetizers I had ordered. I mooched some of the truffle fries off my friend and they were pretty good too! The service is on point. Our server was on top of it and the food came out quick. I also love it how they're open till 2 AM. If they had more choices for entrees then it would definitely be 5/5 stars, but I still highly recommend going to this place. It's a safe first date kinda place lol",

It's really fun and a good place for a quiet first date.  The food is fair--slight better than The Sizzler with a wine list to match.  The scallops were over-cooked and the pasta dishes were unremarkable.  Even the chocolate cake was pretty average.  None of it's bad but unless you want to impress someone with the vibe I wouldn't say it's place worth going to more than once.",

I ordered the shrimp fettuccini and it was good. They don't seem to get a lot of business but It's solely because they're new, poor choice of names and the location doesn't get much traffic.

I would say this place would be semi casual so it wasn't extremely fancy but it had a little elegance to it. They have a bar inside the place so while we waited for the whole party to come, I went to the bar and tried their blueberry mojito. It was so good and on top of that, the bartender was so sweet! It wasn't too strong and he crushed real blueberries in the drink.   Now onto the main course, I ordered the Steak Diane which came with slices of steak, mashed potatoes, and veggies. I also ordered a side of fries because I had a feeling I wouldn't be full so I wanted a filler just for in case. For the cons, I would have to say that the slices of steak were quite small and thin so I expected it to be a little thicker at least. It only came with 4 thin slices. The fries were also not warm when they came out as if they were sitting in the back for a while and of course I would like my food to be hot when it's served. I also asked for ranch for my fries and I just want to say that their ranch did not taste like ranch at all. It tasted extremely watered down.   For dessert I ordered their creme brulee and that was okay too. It had more of a really strong egg taste rather than a vanilla taste in my opinion. Overall this place was just okay but our waitress was so nice, She was very patient with our party of 10. Maybe I'll come back and try something else on their menu.",

The Sparklings is a great restaurant if you are willing to get away from the strip for some reasonably priced good food. They are an American bistro that makes a mean pasta and a delicious cocktail. My family really enjoyed this restaurant especially compared to our previous dining experiences in Vegas. Appetizers were a little small hard to share with 11 unless you order 2 of each. The crispy gnocchi had great flavor in the sauce but I felt like the texture was just like normal gnooci nothing crispy about it. Portions of entrees are fairly large. I had a hard time finishing my spicy seafood pasta which was delicious. The Cajun pasta and bacon mushroom cream pasta were also great. In the end they gave me and my family complementary cheese cake to help celebrate me and my cousins birthday! Once again super glad we got to escape the chaos that is the Vegas strip and got to celebrate in a more intimate place with good food that didn't break the bank! Will recommend all friends who go to Vegas to come here in the future!",

    "text": "Review is for visit on 4-2-16 around 4pm. Friday afternoon, place was pretty dead. We sat at the bar to have some food, and at the time there was only one other person at the bar.   The bartender Rey was personable and seemed attentive at first. My friend ordered a spicy pasta dish and gnocchi appetizer (see pics) and I ordered grilled salmon with capers served over rice. It was supposed to come with a cream sauce, but since I wanted a healthy entree I requested no sauce. Bartender acted like oookaaay as if to imply it was not going to be good without sauce.  I thought oh great, it's going to be dry! But when the meal came out, I thought it was perfectly fine without the sauce.  The salmon was tasty and moist. Serving size was maybe around 3 1/2 oz, with a nice presentation on a small bed of rice. I think it is slightly overpriced at $20 though. Not a big enough portion for $20. It didn't need the capers in my opinion, it had enough flavor.   My friend was satisfied with her app and meal. We were only ordering water as we had been out in the sun all day. Unfortunately my friend had to ask for a water refill, my glass was almost empty and bartender didn't even fill my glass when he refilled hers. Sort of basic to fill both of them at once, isn't it? He didn't have a ton of people to wait on but for whatever reason getting our check and taking our money took a very long time. Sorry that we aren't drinking today...?   I liked the atmosphere of the place, the food was fine but nothing magical that made me want to come back anytime soon. The restaurant part is beautifully decorated with a gorgeous chandelier. I can see this being a great place to have a small gathering for a special event.",

We were charged $8 to swap out the pan seared atlantic salmon's rice for penne pasta. We were not told about this difference in price. If we were told about it, we would have passed on the \"upgrade\", as there's not enough of a difference between rice and pasta to warrant $28 vs. $20.   My girlfriend and I went here in part for her birthday, and we ordered dessert in the form of creme brulee and cheesecake with a scoop of vanilla ice cream. The creme brulee was for her, and this was mentioned when I called in advance to see if we had to make reservations and what they had for birthday girls :) I was served her creme brulee, and she was served my cheesecake with \"Happy Birthday\" written in sauce, minus the scoop of ice cream! We were charged for that scoop of ice cream.   The food was very good! The lemon cream sauce w/the salmon was especially fantastic, but being charged an extra $11 is relatively significant, and is what kept this place from being a 5 in our book.",

    "text": "Decor: 5/5 I just love everything about this place aesthetically. The chairs, the color, the feel something about this place just works in a French industrial kind of way.   Service: 5/5 I've eaten in the bar as well as the restaurant. While I personally prefer they bar because I like the chat with Angel, the dining room is a solid choice. I've been here on about 5 occasions and have never heard a complaint.   Cocktails: 5/5 (can I give 7 stars?) I cannot over emphasize how amazing the cocktails are with Angel. I love classic cocktails and was very spoiled living in NYC with a mixologist roommate that worked in secret members only bars. At Spago there was one fantastic bartender, but he got promoted to oversee cocktails for all Puck restaurants. I catch him when I can. Herbs & Rye is spotty with their drink making. I had an amazing drink once (made by a guy with tattoos) and horrible one same visit (made by the owner, and I sent it back). Angel is consistent and by far my new favorite. Old-fashioned, sazerac, sidecar, mojitos... All fantastic creations. Plus he's down the street, and it doesn't cost me $15-$20 a drink. Score!  Food: 4/5 With the cocktails so far above what I would expect in Vegas (especially off the strip in a non craft cocktail setting), the food is disappointing.  It's very good but nowhere near great. My biggest gripe by far was the lobster bisque without lobster, but even the rue was above average at best. With the exception on the rainbow trout, I felt like the seafood from all of the other dishes (shrimp and clams) weren't the freshest. I could go through a list of things I had there, but honestly, there's nothing memorable.",

    "text": "The Sparklings has been a go to in our household for many meals, but sadly our experiences lately (past 6 months) have left a lot to be desired. I have often times chalked it up to maybe the kitchen was having an off day, but overall I do feel the quality of the food has declined.   We always get the queso, which is served with toast; it's a solid dish that satisfies everyone at the table, and holds them over until entrees arrive. But when we ordered it today, the bread was not even toasted, and it was soggy for some reason. We ate it regardless but not our usual experience with this appetizer.   I ordered elote, which is Mexican street corn. I have had it before and found it strange it's just served in a bowl with nothing to eat the corn with. The flavor at least was there before, but today there was not a whole lot of flavor or cream or mayonnaise base, just tasted like grilled corn with some cotija cheese & cilantro on it. It was underwhelming, and I pushed it to the side.   Next I ordered the bacon wrapped date meatballs to try something different versus my usual club sandwich. The dish came out, presented nicely but the meatballs were obviously reheated with a tomato sauce drenching them. The bacon was flab, I mean completely translucent in color; which I expected it to be cooked. I ate a meatball & a half and it was just off in taste. Almost as if the meatballs were old or expired. And shortly after leaving, I had the worst stomach ache, and still my stomach is killing me as I write this 12 hours later.  After my companion had to leave I chose to have a martini at the bar before departing. I was told it was happy hour and given a HH menu, I ordered an extra dirty martini off the happy hour menu. It wasn't very dirty but I drank it anyways. Bartender was very nice and chatty, but when he brought my check he mentioned he had to charge me twice for the martini. I did find that odd, but I paid it regardless as I know he doesn't set the prices and there probably is some reason he has to do that. Just struck me as strange. Also, the ambiance music was very odd this visit. Like classical music, but It was incredibly boring. Typically not what they have played in the past.  Bottomless mimosas are always nice, and the service has always been spot on. I do critique the fact the mimosas are never presented the same way twice. Sometimes they bring champagne in a carafe on the side. Sometimes they bring several juices awkwardly in a rocks glass, (which is a pain to pour without spilling it down the side every time you refresh your mimosa). Sometimes they just ask what juice you like and pre mix it behind the bar & bring out the carafe for the table. But for the $18 bottomless they do indeed honor the bottomless and have always ensured we were taken care of and I do appreciate that.   People knock the decor and service in some of the reviews. I think the place is decorated nicely & we have only had bad service once and the owner was quick to address us himself & fix it. But I do think the place needs a little TLC when it comes to some small but noticeable things. The patio is littered with cigarette butts, the baseboards need a good scrub or paint, and some of the walls also need touch up paint.   Sadly, I understand the owner takes these reviews very personally. But from what I have heard from members of his own staff, he is stretched thin and an incredibly busy man who manages a few other concepts in addition to The Sparklings. And although he is probably doing the best that he can, it perhaps is just not enough to keep loyal guests coming back, because when you frequent a place (and no I'm not claiming I come in every week), you can compare past visits and it is definitely felt that things are just not as good as they used to be & the place lacks consistency all around. That's the truth, and I think rather than fighting guests about it, you need to take a hard look & realize that there is room for improvement, and fix the things that people are repeatedly telling you are wrong. I hope this review is taken to heart and isn't intended to be hurtful; we truly hope that The Sparklings will be restored to its old self.",

They also have a variety of food to choose from depending on what you are in the mood for.  I started with a drink that had moscato and strawberries in it along with vodka. I thought it would be really sweet and it surprisingly was not. I enjoyed it more on this fact because I don't like when things are too sweet.   We ordered the cheese platter which was really good. I wish I was more hungry because I would have enjoyed it more. I really want to go back to get this. They had such a variety. My favorite was of course the Brie. They also had honey to go along with it and some fruit.   I ordered the spaghetti with meat sauce because I was craving Italian and it was really good. I had leftovers so I was given another chance to enjoy it.   I'd like to come back just for drinks and a appetizer next time. A chance to enjoy the food but not get overly full and enjoy the atmosphere.",

I plan everything here from Bachelorette party brunches to simple BFF dinners. I have come here every year for my birthday for the last two years as well. The atmosphere is great, the staff is SO friendly. I've not once had a bad experience or encountered anything even remotely close to unsatisfied.  The staff clearly help each other out. If no one is up front, it is most likely because they are running dishes or behind the bar. If your glass looks half empty, any employee will come and fill your drink.  Absolute love, all around.",

The place is classy fancy but you can still come in casual clothes and not feel out of place. Great place for a fancy night out too. And the happy hour is great 5-10 30% off ALL alcohol and then starts back at midnight till close.   The food is fancy and very good, kind of pricey but totally worth it! I am eating lunch here for the first time right now and so far so good. I actually discovered they have a more reasonably priced brunch menu (sat-sun) and lunch menu Monday through Friday.   They also have a patio area with a lot of space and half of the bar is outside too.   They have a very wide selection of liquor and wines. I will say that the portions could be bigger for the price of the food and the service can be a bit slow but it is worth it when you get a delicious drink and wonderful food!",

I was expecting the crunchy gnocchi to be a little more crunchy but I didn't know what gnocchi was to begin with. I guess the crunchy part was the walnuts but I may be mistaken.   The service was good and they made our food pretty fast. The ambiance was extremely nice especially the bar. Bathroom was a bit dirty. Comfy chairs and a lot of space. Overall 3/5.",

The crab and spinach dip was and smoked salmon crostini is a must try!! The calamari consisted of small bite sizes in a reasonable portion but I felt that it was a bit bland. Yes, there was sauce but without it, it didn't really taste like much. I got the shrimp and crab ravioli with alfredo sauce and it was so good, not too heavy and not too bland!!! I did ask for Parmesan in it because I love cheese so much. I tried the pesto but I felt like it could've been better. It tastes like any ordinary pesto. For dessert we got the flourless chocolate cake and the creme brulee. For all you chocolate lovers, this is your go to cake. It's very thick and rich in chocolate. The creme brulee wasn't overly sweet, which I preferred. The atmosphere was also very nice and welcoming as well. Employees were extremely helpful with great customer service.

The bar was the only part of the restaurant open so I'll cut the bartender some slack considering he was taking care of a lot of people but we had to go to the bar several times to get things like extra lemon or place a food order because he never came back to our table. Onto the food, probably the worst part. I ordered the French onion soup and the calamari. The soup literally looked like someone took a slice of square kraft cheese and melted it onto of a bowl full of salty water. The cheese was barely melted, when it should have had a slightly crispy brownish tint like all normal French onion soups. The calamari was equally as bad, it was soggy and tasted like someone defrosted it in the back and popped it into a microwave. Finally, I ordered the creme brulee which was awful. The top sugar coat wasn't torched enough so there were a ton of parts that were not crunchy and just sugar sitting on the creme. The creme itself was bland and gross. Overall, I would never recommend this place to anyone. The bad service and disgusting food is plenty reason to avoid his place at all costs.",

    "text": "The atmosphere in this place is classy and modern without seeming overdone. The high ceilings are accessorized with low-hanging chandeliers, and the interior is sort of divided into a bar section and a restaurant section. The tables are placed far enough from one another to allow for plenty of privacy even without curtains or dividers between them.   The service is great. Our servers were on top of their game throughout our stay, refilling our waters and coming by regularly to check on us. Stars for attentive and friendly service!   My friends ordered the honey bread appetizer and the walnut appetizer along with some pasta dishes. I ordered the Steak Diane for a main dish.   I loved the appetizers! The honey bread, which I would not have ordered myself, came out a pleasant surprise, as its crispiness was accentuated with thick honey. On the other hand, the crunchy walnuts contrasted very nicely with their sauce. The appetizers made me expect the best from my main dish. Unfortunately, I was let down, as my Steak Diane came out way too salty. Bummer.   Overall, the atmosphere and the service here were lovely. The food would have been as well, if it hadn't been for the ocean water-marinated steak.",

My co-workers had a dinner night-out and I highly recommended this place, and so everyone came in with the high expectations I set for them, and they were all please with the service and the food and thanked me for telling them about this place!   We also invited our friends from out of town to join us and they also LOVED their experience here.   This isn't a biased statement, but their Rib Eye steak is the best I've ever had in my life. I'd say better than the steaks I've ordered at a lot of higher-rated steak restaurants where you'd pay for it a la carte. They pick the best cut of meat that just falls apart when you cut into it.   This has easily become my favorite restaurant, and EVERYONE needs to try it out, you won't be disappointed.",

    "text": "To find a neighborhood gem that serves lovely food and great cocktails is always a plus in my book, and Sparklings is now a favorite stop for a few martinis and some great appetizers.  I have yet to try a main entree, which I assume is excellent, but their plethora of appetizers keeps me craving smaller plates over a nice, big steak.  The menu is simple--appetizers, soups, sandwiches, pasta and rice, and then entrees and desserts.  On our first visit, my husband and I went through four cocktails and about 6 appetizers.  Our bill remained well under $90 and we left happy.  My first suggestion is to try their apple & beet salad with candied walnuts along with their crispy gnocchi.  The gnocchi is rich and pillowy, while the salad provides that light contrast.  Move on to the scallops and brown butter gnocchi (if you don't mind doubling up on the gnocchi), then some grilled wings and meatballs.  Those bacon-wrapped meatballs with dates provides a salty and sweet dish with a side of grilled, sweet chicken wings.  We washed it all down with a few Chandelier martinis, a French 75, and a bourbon mule.  Hit it up with some creme brulee or cheesecake if you have room to spare, and your meal will be complete.  I love Sparklings and will forever be a regular at this joint.  If you have yet to try this place, hop in your car any time before 1am to get there before closing.  It's worth the drive.",

They have few \"private\" type of seatings available for big groups so that was good. Service was good too since there weren't too many groups in house- probably like 3 or 4? And a few at the bar. Our waitress was very sweet and attentive; checked up on us a lot. The owner/manager came out to chat with us as well & he seemed cool! They have a good selection of food & drinks.  Now for the food: we started by ordering the  portobello fries. It was good & something different. For my main meal I ordered the spicy seafood pasta. Now BEWARE it is SUPER SPICY!! The portion was huge with lots of seafood and it looked delicious but once you put it in your mouth, you were on fire! Even my friends who could tolerate spicy foods said it was pretty extreme. And because of this, it messed up my stomach for two days :( So if you're going to order this, I would suggest you to tell them not to make it too spicy.  My friends ordered the hamburger steak, steak salad, cajun pasta, & ribs. I didn't get to try any of their food but they all said it was delicious~ Especially the hamburger steak & ribs.  Unfortunately for the steak salad, my friend's steak had a lot of fatty parts- where she couldn't eat so she told the waitress and they were able to bring out a new one for her.  Tons of parking outside of the restaurant.  I would like to go back next time but definitely will order something else.",

I ordered a chicken sandwich and subbed mayonnaise for pesto from the lunch menu and when it came to the table it was covered mayonnaise. I told the server and she apologized and took it back to the kitchen, when she came back to the table she brought the same sandwich and placed it back on the table and brought a side of pesto. I specifically asked \"is this the same plate and sandwich\" she said \"ya the chef isn't going to remake it so I brought a side of pesto\". Honestly, I couldn't believe the customer service and lack of responsibility that this restaurant  displayed. I don't usually write reviews but for the pure principle of the service that Sparklings demonstrated I will not return there.  Regarding your rude and dismissive response, I think your comment further confirms what I have expressed. You may think that the behavior your staff displayed is justified through your response; however, that is also incorrect. In addition to the lunch order we also had dessert and coffee. Clearly, your priority is purely monetary. It's evident that your lackadaisical  approach to a business is why you are never busy and unable to handle or accommodate costumer requests.",

With a 1/4 glass of wine left, I asked for the check and the fill-in bartender asked why we were leaving.

    "text": "I decided to come here the night after racking my brain over where I wanted to eat. I could not for the life of me decide where I wanted to go. It's a semi fine dining restaurant with affordable pricing.   I went with 2 other friends. We each ordered appetizers and an entree. We ordered the grilled octopus, portobello mushrooms, and spinach and crab dip as appetizers. The grilled octopus was overly chewy. I just kept chewing and chewing and chewing. The flavor wasn't that great either. I liked the spinach dip, but didn't like the crab that went on top. They offered 6 pita bread pieces, which I didn't feel like was enough bread. I had tons of dip leftover after using up the pita. I LOVED the portobello fries! It's huge pieces of the mushroom cap lightly battered and deep fried. The mushrooms were very moist and the batter was crunchy and delicious. My friend ordered a steak salad, and it was delicious! The dressing was a bit sweet, but I loved the feta cheese. The jambalaya was okay. I've never had jambalaya, so I don't know if it was the best I've ever had. I ordered a mushroom and bacon spaghetti but I wanted linguine instead. It was a creamy sauce and really delicious.   For dessert, we ordered the trio which came with a mini creme brule, flourless chocolate cake, and ice cream. The flourless chocolate cake tasted really rich.   All in all, I had a great time. I would definitely go again. My only issue is that they should a bit more variety on the menu. They do have a ton of appetizers, so the next time I go I might just order a bunch of those.",

I know my steaks and filet will never have fat within the cut. I think it's sad they passed it off as a filet. Calamari was ok, martini was eh. Like I said filets weren't really filets and the chocolate cake tasted like it was defrosted and then served.. Nothing to brag about and definitely won't be returning;(",

The prices on the menu are reasonable and actually on the lower side. I enjoyed the zucchini sticks and also the pulled pork sliders. I had a glass of scotch on the rocks during happy our and it was only around 6bux. The place can get a little awkward because it's just way to quiet. The lighting is a little bright. Make sure that you let your waiter know your gonna be splitting checks because the waiters don't really expect to do it. If your in a large groups make sure to let them know in advance. Other than that, great place for an odd location.",

    "text": "The Sparklings is an order of magnitude above any other restaurant within several miles. Where to begin:   1) The decor. This is a tastefully decorated space with a crystal chandelier and every chair is comfortable. This is a place to take your date, or to celebrate your special occasion.  2) The food. The menu items are ambitious and perfectly executed. I had the beef short ribs which melted in my mouth. The lobster bisque hit the spot as well.   3) The service was professional, attentive, and not intrusive. It's the kind of service you appreciate, because you don't get it very often.  4) The value. You can spend as much or as little as you like on your meal, but do you have the willpower not to indulge in the wonderful appetizers, drinks and desserts? I think not. It's not significantly more expensive than other Southwest Las Vegas neighboorhood eateries, and the food is better.  5) What it isn't. It's not incidental to some video poker bar. It doesn't have a smoking section.",

We ordered scallops which were overcooked and served with this bland fried rice cake. Next was the brown butter gnocchi which tasted almost bland with a hint of bathroom freshener and had the texture of a semi-softened laffytaffy with a crunch in the beginning. The truffle fries were decent, nothing impressive. Tasted like store bought frozen fries. The spaghetti aglio e olio tasted like a cardboard with a hint of garlic. The rice au gratin with chicken tasted like trash. Disgusting. Honestly, I would've been better off making myself some pasta roni and rice a roni. Super slow service, there were barely any people there. If I could give it negative stars I would. I don't know what's wrong with all of your tastebuds lol",

    "text": "It was Christmas Day and after getting back from Mount Charleston for the day we be came very hungry and I was on a search to find a restaurant that was open. What do you know... there are barely any restaurants open to eat at on Christmas Day and without a reservation, including the top Lodge at Mt. Charleston and at any casino restaurants. After my 15th call to find a place to eat I found that Sparklings was open for business! Lucky us! The food was good and the ambience was great. The price was relatively cheap. The space is huge and the chairs are cozy. Perfect for a couple on date night.  5/5 - Pretty in Pink drink was delicious. Can't go wrong with fresh strawberries in a drink, unless they're spoiled I guess. Haha. I did order another one but my server forgot about it and I never got it. By the time he checked on us, I was already done eating and ready to go. I would say that's the only mistake this place made.   4/5 - Queso Fundido was good but must be eaten hot and immediately for that gooey cheese or else it becomes a solid.   4/5 - French Onion Soup is always good but always salty. I'm a salt licker so I didn't mind it.   4/5 - Mushroom Fries were good, almost as good as Echo & Rig.   4/5 - Lasagna was like some other Reviewer mentioned... \"Just like Stouffers\". Which I think is a good thing and I think it's because of the taste of the sausage... Good with a bunch of herbs. Tasted like sweet fennel was in there. My favorite part was the hardened lasagna noodles around the dish. I like that 'al dente' bite.   I would definitely go back and try more of their many dishes. They have a huge menu. The bar looked very nice, I would just go there for a cocktail too. It's nicely separated from the restaurant.",

Today my friend and I decided to partake in sparklings and we arrived around 1:40 p.m. and it was virtually empty so I guess we missed the brunch Rush. However the food was really delicious. I had the chicken and waffles and my friend had the open-faced chicken sandwich which we both thoroughly enjoyed. It's semi hard to find  a brunch establishment around town who can effectively make a good chicken and waffle, which included a full size Belgian waffle and perfectly seasoned chicken that wasn't overcooked or undercooked. The servers were very friendly and prompt and their bottomless mimosas for $36 was a great way for us to extend our brunch. Overall, I say go check this place out.",

I liked their outside setting, it was somewhat chilly but it was still really nice. They're drinks are 30% off during HH, and the service was phenomenal. I didn't know we can actually reserve for their HH, so we'll definitely do that next time. Since I was the first of the 6 to arrive on a Friday evening, I decided to order their moscato and Pink tourmaline (I also ordered voodoo later that night). I'm a sweet drinker, so if you like something sweet but still have alcohol, these are my recommendations. Just a heads up, they no longer serve Amethyst according to the host that also took my drink order. After the rest of my group arrived, we found an empty area inside where we moved our things to. The servers were accommodating and we received our food and drinks in a timely manner. I ordered their cheese platter as a snack for my drinks. The platter comes with fried Pita bread, I believe. When I had this, I feel in love! It was delicious and just the right amount of sweetness, salty, and savory. I will order this dish again but would request extra pita if possible since this really balanced everything on the plate. At the end of the evening they allowed us to split our checks which is very kind of them (the host & bartender asked us in the beginning about this, which I appreciated). Thank you!  [Side Note: TIP YOUR SERVERS! It's common courtesy to do so. Since we left happy and our experience was positive, I left more than 20%]",

Can't believe I haven't been here sooner since my friend lives literally down the street  Let's start with the food. For appetizers I had the truffle fries, crab spinach dip with pita bread (fried and grilled), and the pesto gnocchi-- all appetizers are a 5/5 rating because they were super delicious! For my meal- my sister and I got the spicy seafood pasta (5/5 rating) with average spice level and it was the perfect spice-- not too light of a spice and it wasn't over the top spice. My sisters boyfriend got the ribeye steak which looked delicious but he said it may have been a little too \"fatty\" for him.. I didn't taste it so I'm not going to rate it but it looked good to me!  The decor in the restaurant was nice and not what I expected. I almost felt under-dressed walking into here with my leggings and slippers.  The customer service was on point! She was on it with recommendations and checked up on us regularly.   I will DEFINITELY be back because there was so much more I wanted to try.... like the crab and shrimp ravioli. OH and they do brunch EVERYDAY until 3PM. I gotta try their brunch for sure!! This restaurant definitely did not disappoint me.",

Service was fast & very attentive.  The first trip i tried the salmon dish and substituted the rice for mashed potatoes. Was delish! The next time we ordered the portobello mushroom fries for our appetizer super yum! For dinner i ordered the bacon and mushroom spaghetti with cream sauce and added chicken. . My husband ordered tomato basil soup, rib eye steak dinner and entire dessert menu lol. We left full and happy ! My husband and I loved it so much we brought our 7 year old daughter with us a few days later. And she even couldn't get enough of her food ( and ours) lol. We will definitely be back!",

The decor is simple with crystal shandaliers, flowers and velvet seating. Their appetizer section is huge and you can order multiple to fill your up. We had gnocchi, truffle corn, cheese board, Asian chicken wings, and Shepard pie. Everything was delicious and our waiter Joe was nice and charming. This is also a great place for large parties with their private sections. A must try :)",

I went here to have drinks with my girlfriend and I arrived before she did and we wanted to sit in the bar. There were two empty stools on opposite sides of the bar. I asked the bartender if she could arrange the seats so there could be two together, she looked at me like I was at total idiot, rolled her eyes, moaned and walked away- she didn't even give me a response!! So then I proceeded to ask the other customers at the bar if they would be willing to move so I could have two seats together and they were very happy to. Why the bartender couldn't do that is so frustrating.   We ordered a cheese plate and wine. We received our wine in about 10 minutes after ordering, we NEVER recieved our cheese plate!! We asked about it maybe 4-5 times and the bartender told us, when she would look at us after waving her down, that 'It was coming', or 'It's almost done'. Almost done?!?!?! It's a CHEESE PLATE!! We waited waaaaaayyyyy to long for it, almost 30 minutes.   It was a bit busy, and they wern't properly staffed. That is no excuse for awful service and never receiving a cheese plate.   I really wish this place was better becuase I live just down the street, I will never be going here again. The bar is way to small and the main dining area is so large and awkward, why would anyone sit there is beyond me.",

We came in on Monday night as a party of 5. There were two other tables occupied and we were told we would need to wait to be seated. It ended up being about 5 minutes before we were seated.   Water was spilled on our table, our water glasses remained consistently empty, food had to be sent back because it was missing ingredients, and part of our order was forgotten and never provided. Luckily we didn't get charged for it.   However, the food and sides are all solid. The food is awesome but the service needs a lot of work.",

They were having ticket issues so we didn't get our food for about half an hour & when we asked a random server to check on our food he explained the situation & was surprised our server didn't do so earlier. He apologized on his behalf so that was nice. When the food finally came out, everything was correct. My family said their quality of food was alright but honestly my Cajun chicken & shrimp was so bland & the bell peppers were nearly raw, still so crunchy as if they weren't cooked in together & the sauce was watery. Overall decent but not great experience. I'd only return bc their bottomless mimosa deal isn't bad & the decor inside is really cute for pictures .",

    "text": "I don't usually give negative reviews, but this was awful! The lobster bisque was the very worst I have ever had. I threw it away after one taste.   I also got the shepherd's pie. I don't quite understand how this dish is categorized as shepherd's pie. It was huge chunks of greasy ground beef mixed with equally large chunks of vegetables sitting in said grease.  There was a scoop of mashed potatoes sitting in the middle of it...clearly it was cooked separately as it's on dish and added to the overcooked ground beef. The pie crust on top was ridiculous.  Since these were so disappointing I decided to really inspect the \"crab\" spinach dip so I put it on a plate and dissected it. It was somewhat decent for a spinach dip, but I am being 100% serious when I say I saw absolutely no crab, nor was there the slightest hint of crab presence in the flavor.     On a positive note- My husband said the salmon was delicious, although the serving size was very small.   I am so disappointed, as the reviews on this place are wonderful for the most part. The food I tried was legitimately awful so I have no desire to give it another try. Skip this place, it's not worth it.",

I sat at the bar and ordered wine and a few vegetarian appetizers, one of which was spinach and cheese ravioli (I am a vegetarian). When the food was brought out, it all looked good and I was excited to try it. I had a bite of the ravioli and immediately thought that something was wrong and indeed it was. They had brought shrimp ravioli to a vegetarian! So this was my very 1st time ever having shrimp. Not only was I furious about the kitchen mistake, but I also got an allergic reaction a few minutes after that bite! There was no managers at the restaurant. However, the bartender was very attentive and sincerely concerned which I appreciated. He took care of the check. I left, bought some benadryl from the nearby store and called it a night. Luckily for the restaurant, the allergic reaction was not bad, otherwise I would have taken legal actions. I will never go back!  +some constructive criticism... the place looks very nice but the bathrooms are disgusting! The food and wine selection is good but the wine list doesn't have info about the region and year of the wines (which is essential for a wine list). And again, train the kitchen staff to take food orders and dietary restrictions seriously.",

I was pretty surprised that this place stays open until 3am (its really awesome for a local restaurant) When we walked we were promptly greeted and seated.  Ambience: The ambience is so cute, very grand and quaint at the same time. I love the mismatch motif. It's nothing I've ever seen before in Vegas. The Sparklings is like Alice in Wonderland meets Breakfast at Tiffany's. They played current EDM at the bar (where we sat at).   Food: We ordered the portobello fries and garlic truffle fries for an appetizer then ordered the spaghetti in cream sauce and a cheesesteak sandwich. For dessert we ordered the cheese cake. The pasta was perfectly al dente and the sauce was savory. The sandwich was served with a salad and it was succulent and juicy.   Service:  Everyone on staff was very hospitable. Our server was Ray the bartender. I don't know where to begin with how great Ray was. He made sure our drinks were always topped off and always checked up on us. I mentioned that it was my bf's birthday, nonchalantly, when we ordered our drinks at the beginning of dinner and when our dessert came out he put a candle on our cheesecake (little cues like that win me over; attention to detail). When my bf and I finished our lovely meal we sat at the bar and enjoyed a couple drinks. We had a wonderful time conversing with Ray. He is truly a wonderful bartender and a beautiful soul.  Overall: Came for the experience and stayed for the service.   The Sparklings is a must for Vegas...Go!",

Casual or dressy you won't feel out of place or uncomfortable.  House salad was great and the blackened trout appitizer was fantastic. Pan seared salmon was good, but the trout had more flavor.  For dessert went with the trio...such a good choice to share! We will cone back for sure. Looking forward to them starting to do brunch on weekends sometime in the near future.  Until next time Sparklings ;)",

We took the big table at the bar and bartender Rey and Angel took care of us. We were all having a good time, from our initial greeting when we walked in to us leaving out the door, perfect service! The food is delicious, we all did buffet style so we all had a lil bit of everything and not one of us was disssapointed. I mean, when u have great service and great food, u automatically have a great time!! Our bartenders were friendly, on top of everything, making sure we didn't need anything, they were super attentive! I will be telling all my friends about this restaurant! It's a must that u go check it out! Amazing experience!!",

    "text": "A quick review after a birthday celebration dinner  -  I'm giving this place 3 stars for mediocre food, but great service!  I ordered the Rib-Eye steak with zucchini sticks and calamari as appetizers, all of which I can only describe as nothing more than average. While the did cut like butter, the seasoning on it was rather bland. The zucchini sticks were one of the better things I tried as the servings sizes were big, but I do feel like they overcooked the food. One of my main problems with both the zucchini sticks and calamari was that it seemed to be smothered in oil. I can just taste it in my mouth, and halfway through the calamari, I had to stop feeling as I started to feel a gag reflex coming from within me. So yeah, that's the food.   However, I do have to admit that the ambience is great! Old school, Italian-themed with great music. I almost want to give 4 stars for them having my favorite song on their playlist (Unsteady - XAmbassadors)! The place is very spacious and roomy, and definitely does not seem like your average barstaurant.  One thing I did appreciate though was that our waiter managed to pick up on the fact that it was my birthday today. He gave us a free scoop of ice cream on the house with the words \"Happy Birthday\" in pretty calligraphy. It makes up for the fact that we got our water 10 minutes late.",

The food was tasty the ceasar salad huge for 5 bucks 3 bucks more with chicken? outrageous!  Had the crispy gnocchi  app and with a salad it was a meal throw in a glass of house red and I was a happy woman.  No need to get all gussied up. The sparkles are in the decor and the food ...not you!  So pop in for a lunch or dinner..you will really like it.  A big shout out to Mnts Edge peeps!  We are just down the street. Also have private rooms and big dining areas for groups and a full bar area you can have a drink at if there is a wait. Honestly though...this place is,my new go to for lunch when I am out and about.  And dinner with the hubby Anthony waited on me and was informed. . .kind..and a  pleasure . Check it out",

Their menu offers the type of items I always looks for at new American restaurants. The interior design of the place is also super eclectic and feels very homey.   The bartender was super friendly, as well as our waiter and the manager. The drinks were really good and creative. I loved the combinations on the menu. I wanted to try every single appetizer, but sadly that isn't realistic. The ones I did try were good. Some of them weren't executed as well as I had hoped. But still, I wasn't extremely disappointed. The pesto gnocchi was by far my favorite thing I ate. I highly recommend it as well as the fried zucchini. Mmmmm so good!",

    "text": "Went to Sparklings late night, very excited since my girlfriend and I had heard that it was very good.    Let me start off by saying that this place is open late (until 2am) and the bartender had told us that 2 servers had left shortly before a small late night crowd of 4 small groups came in.    As we entered we were not greeted by a host or hostess.  We waited for about 2 minutes then decided to walk over to the bar.  1) Because there was someone there who could helpe us and 2) because the music was way too quiet in the dining area, uncomfortably quiet.  It's a very large open room and with all that silence and only 2 couples eating, it had this kind of echo that big open rooms have.  Was a little strange.  Bartender was very friendly and attentive given the fact that he was serving 4 groups and working both the dining room and the bar area.    The food sounded really good, but I wasn't very impressed.  -The gnocchi sounded delicious.  It was good, but nothing great. -The Shepherd's Pie was actually pretty good.  Nothing incredible, but good. -Bacon and date wrapped meatballs were...good.  Are we sensing a theme here? -Salmon over rice with caper sauce.  Good.  Sauce was great in flavor, but lacking because there was barely any on my salmon.    The service was great at the bar, but I was shocked that we waited 2 minutes at the front for a host which never came.  The music in the bar was too loud and over the top.  One of the TVs was playing infommercials.  I very much wanted to give this place more stars.  Especially since the bartender was so nice, but we unfortunately had a 3-star experience.",

We had a larger party with a reservation. I think it is common that the servers just automatically give everyone a water and then asks for separate drink orders. They only gave a few people waters, I asked for refills, and some people did not get their drinks they ordered. The cocktails were very diluted and multiple drink orders had to be remade. The servers all seemed very rushed and did not provide a welcoming environment. One person in our party ordered a steak, it wasn't cooked right so it was sent back. Our entrees did not come out at the same time and one guest did not get his entree until about 10 minutes after everyone else got their food. We also brought in a cake for a birthday. No one informed our party of a cake cutting fee and we were charged one. Not only that, the staff lost the box to the cake so it had to be carried home without a box. I do not recommend this place to have a nice dinner.",

They should know who had order what.  It's not that busy.  Had linguine with clams, didn't offer plate to hold shells so had to put shells on  table. When asked about their wine menu, said don't know and had wine menu in hand.  If u don't know then pass the menu to us to see!  We can read.",

My friends had a veggie sandwich and a shrimp poboy. They loved it. The spinach crab dip was pretty good & the gnocchi was awesome!!

Great place to have a bridal shower, baby shower, small type venues.   The food was really good. They made it family style and it worked out great with everyone in the table. There were like 7 different dishes =chicken and shrimp jumbalaya, mussels, carbonara, chicken wings, scallops , garlic fries, arugula flat bread and they were all good. impressive. The owner and the waitress were really nice.  We had little kids with us and the waitress put them in their own table and entertained them with paper and crayons so the adults can enjoy.",

Our server was so nice, but the pace and order of our meal wasn't the greatest. Our apps came out promptly followed by our mains almost immediately. The only problem was we ordered drinks that weren't delivered until all of our food had come. There was a large birthday party going on, so maybe that's why service was off. The food was good, it may be a nice place to grab drinks and small plates. Am glad I tried it, but will probably not go back.",

They have this cute little sign written in flowers, and a beautiful chandelier right in the center of the room surrounded by lavish vases and fresh cut (they looked fresh) flowers. I love the decor of this place! They also had walled off areas that seem perfect for families so they could contain the madness within those little walls (or at least try to).   Okay, on to the important things! We tried 4 different appetizers & a sandwich to share. We were stuffed by the end of our meal. We had zucchini sticks, dates and meatballs wrapped in bacon, crispy gnocchi, crab spinach dip, and a philly cheese steak. I wasn't blown away by any culinary feats happening over here although I did enjoy the meatballs. They were definitely the best dish out of them all. The crispy gnocchi looked very skimpy compared to the photos others have posted and they weren't very crispy... I wish there were more veggies or something to it. It was very green and kind of boring to eat with those soft peas and the soft gnocchi. The best part were the pecans in it. However, I think the selling points are that they are open very late, and provide a nice alternative to in-n-out. The prices are ridiculously low. We spent $35 on all that food, and it's in a beautiful surrounding. Therefore, we will be back and I want to try the portobello fries!",

We had the portobello fries (TO DIE FOR) which were so flavorful! My glass of wine was great. Ordered a pasta with white sauce and it was very \"clean\" and fresh tasting like they just made it in the back from scratch but definitely needed a little flavor. I kept adding salt and pepper but if you bring it home and add season salt it would be the bomb! My mom got the pork chops and they were WONDERFUL. It was almost like a light teriyaki glaze flavor. The dessert trio was great for sharing for 2. Only gave it 4 stars because our server only had 2 tables and took so long to bring the check which killed the vibe and whenever I called him over for something he seemed a little annoyed but nothing that wouldn't keep me from coming back.",

Servers are friendly (maybe even a little too much so). The only reason I subtracted a star was because of the strong smell of chemical cleaner in the air.

The Cosmopolitan-esque chandelier in the main dining room gives The Sparklings a feminine feel. This is the ideal place to host any girlie event--like a bridal shower. They placed our party of 12 in a private room towards the back.   Our server was very hospitable and engaging, but some of his antics need to be toned down a few notches. He recommended the club sandwich, the grilled chicken sandwich, and the shepherds pie. I ordered the shepherds pie and it did not disappoint.  Don't be deceived by the dull exterior, because like your mother says, \"It's what's inside that counts.\"",

Totally not expecting that. Plus, the host was pretty good looking, too. Heyy!   First things ordered were drinks.  My first drink, which, according to the host, was a favorite, tasted like medicine. I don't know, maybe the people like the taste of Benadryl with their dinner, but that was not for me. I then ordered, and sang \"Return of the Mack.\" couldn't help myself.  That was a little better.    Since I wasn't that hungry, I ordered crab dip which cam with pita chips.  My meal was tasty.  I also ate off other peoples plates.  The truffle fries are really good. So was the pasta.  It had a nice flavor to it.  Wasn't bland at all.    For such a large group they were very accommodating.  No one came in at the same time, but all of the food came out relatively quick once ordered. And came out together, so the group ate together.  It was a pleasant experience.",

A great IPA recommended by a bubbly bartender and an evening of apps. The crispy gnocchi was well created with great balance of flavor. The sliders were a good size and full of flavor. Portobello fries were awesome. The dipping sauces are crafted well and have purpose on the plate. The staff were prompt with fulfilling my needs and well educated about the menu. The manager for the night is also the owner named Andy. When he made the rounds to our location I was pleasantly surprised with his personal interest with our happiness of experience. Overall Awesome.",

Based the the stars from Yelp, I decided to give this a try.    We ordered for Gorgonzola flat bread, calamari, chipotle chicken pasta and pesto linguine.   Presentation - I was disappointed receiving our appetizers. It looked like our flat bread was microwaved however main dishes were ok.  Quality of food - the food was good. I was however disappointed at how watered down the sauce with calamari was. I would dip my calamari in the sauce and it was dripping like it was deluded with water.   Price - price was fair. It was a nice restaurant and very clean so the food and ambiance was nice.  Service - not the best. I'm not sure if our waiter wasn't serving everyone by himself, service would have been better. The water tastes horrible, the soda was stale and I had to request a refill on my drinks. I also had to ask for a box and someone who was not our waiter came by our table once to see how we were doing. This place was not busy at all, however, there could have been a little more effort.   I would rate this place a 3.5.",

    "text": "I went here after a hot, sweaty workout wearing my KD VI's and yoga pants to meet up with a friend who was wearing a suit looking cute as a button. I was definitely under-dressed but I was too hungry to care. We sat at the bar while waiting on our other friend.  We got a booth. The seats were big, nice and comfy. The table has a marble top. The chandelier was so pretty and I love how they have flowers spell out \"The Sparklings\" in front.   We shared a bunch of appetizers and a bottle of sparkling wine. Our bartender/server with wild hair seemed abrasive at first but he loosened up quick when my friend called him out and gave him a hard time the whole night. It was pretty hilarious.  Truffle Parmesan Fries: Comes with ketchup and lemon garlic sauce. The lemon garlic sauce tasted like it had dill in it. The fries were crisp and were a cross between skinny fries and steak fries in terms of thickness and texture.    Bacon and Dates Wrapped Meatball: I like bacon-wrapped dates. I like good meatballs. But together smothered in marinara, it was a bit strange. I wish the bacon was a bit more crisp. 3/5  Tuna Tartare: Fresh tuna with avocado and mango cubes.  It comes with crostini. This was alright. 3.5/5  Gorgonzola Flatbread with Honey: Just like what the name implies - nothing complicated. It's simple yet tasty. Who doesn't like cheese and honey? 3/5  Grapes, Arugula and Ricotta Flatbread: With candied walnuts and balsamic vinaigrette. This was good. Sweetness and juiciness from the grapes, peppery arugula, mild taste of ricotta and crunch from the walnuts. 4/5  Roasted Beet and Apple Salad: With arugula, candied walnuts and balsamic vinaigrette. I don't like beets but this was pretty amazing. It looked pretty and the textures were wonderful. Soft beets, crisp apples and walnuts. 4/5  Crispy Gnocchi: Gnocchi in pesto with Italian sausage, peas and candied walnuts. I love pesto and the sauce was spot on. The gnocchi was not as crispy as I expected. 4/5  Grilled Octopus: Baby octopus marinated in soy sauce. It has a nice char to it. A different server put our plate of octopus on our table and said \"here's your octopuses\" which started a short-lived debate. He told us \"octopi is actually wrong...I looked it up\". Well, octopuses and octopi are both correct, actually      /endtangent. 4.5/5  I didn't feel too under-dressed when I saw some lady wearing booty shorts and sneakers. It would be nice to come back here and next time, I'll wear a dress and my favorite Gucci heels - yes, it's worth seeing my tomboy self die a little.",

I didn't get the opportunity to try any of their food this time around, but we sat at the bar and had a drink and I enjoyed it so much I can't wait to return to give their food options a whirl next time.  Walking in, I was pleasantly surprised by the restaurant interior. It's very spacious and super cute. The perfect place for a date night or girls night out. We walked past the dining area and settled in at  the bar. Seats are comfortable and bartenders were friendly and very attentive. They have just about every bottle you can imagine, so you can request just anything your heart desires. I went with The Chandelier, from the cocktail menu, but my friend wanted and White Gummy Bear and the bartender was happy to oblige.   The drinks were tasty and pretty reasonably priced. I debated ordering an appetizer while I was there, but decided to try to be good since we had just eaten dinner elsewhere. The food menu is extensive and everything seemed reasonably priced, so I look forward to coming back soon and trying some appetizers as well as entrees.",

Also enjoyed Manuscript Red Blend wine, delicious!  Happy hour on Sundays-Thursdays(I think) 6pm-10pm 12am-2am is 20% off all alcohol in restaurant area and 30% in bar area. There is a different happy hour on Friday and Saturdays. Not too pricy and good service. Will now frequent this place!",

So, we came in around 8. There were a lot of us & im sure we were a confusing group of people to serve lol. But they didn't start taking our orders until 9. We practically sat there for an hour waiting... I'm not sure if it was cos they were waiting for every single person in our party to come or what. At least I wasn't alone waiting for an hour. Anyways, my friend ordered an appetizer & forgive me, idk what it's called but a picture will be posted. The flavor was amazing! I wouldn't have wanted to order it by just looking at the description lol but I'm glad she did. I ordered the spaghetti with bacon & mushroom cream sauce & we shared that. Hugeeee portion & a pretty heavy meal, but definitely a must try. Our other friend ordered the crispy gnocchi since we saw it was a favorite on Yelp. I didn't really care much for it. I guess I had high expectations for it but they weren't met. & for dessert, I got the tempura ice cream (coffee). This was very well fried. Not too much tempura overpowering the ice cream & it was crispy, not floury.   Overall, it was a good experience! Didn't think I would come back after the first time but I've changed my mind.",

My family and I stopped in here for dinner. We wanted to try something new. There weren't very many people there on a Sunday night. The ambience is definitely not your run-of-the-mill. It's a wonderful combination of modern meets classic. An open, airy, yet sophisticated vibe.  With only a couple tables aside from ourselves, the service was pretty good. We were immediately brought waters by an employee, and our waitress was overall friendly. The drinks were great, too - very presentable. I had the BLUEBERRY MOJITO and it looked beautiful! My dad got a MOSCOW MULE and my sister a CHOCOLATE STOUT.  The only reason why I docked a star was because of the food. Don't get me wrong, it's good - as well as surprisingly affordable - but it's not the best I've ever had. For appetizers, we had the PARMESAN TRUFFLE FRIES and the BACON & DATES WRAPPED MEATBALLS. The latter were a bit on the lacking end. They were just okay, the tomato sauce seemed like it needed more kick. As for entrees, my dad and I both got the CAJUN CHICKEN AND SHRIMP PASTA, my brother opted for the SPAGHETTI WITH MUSHROOM & BACON CREAM SAUCE, and my sister ordered the RIB-EYE STEAK, which she said she loved. She and my brother both finished their entrees; my dad and I took our leftover pasta to-go. I wasn't really feeling it. It just didn't have a congruent overall taste.   We didn't have much room for dessert, so I can't comment on that. Overall though, we had a pleasant experience. The staff was friendly and the atmosphere made it worth it.",

    "text": "Fun fact: owners of Soyo and Oyshi own this joint =)  which makes the food/experience here even more amazing.....to think that restaurants known for Asian food could make American/Italian inspired food THIS good.  Again, this is spot caught my eyes and stomach once I saw it on Instagram. Came here after a night of shopping and movies with the boyfriend; and since it's right by his house, we stopped in to use up the GCs his family gave us.  You would never expect a shabby chic decorated restaurant in this log cabin exterior. So cute with open space, rustic furniture, romantic lighting, and a chandelier. This restaurant would be great for a first date or date night =)  We got there little past 10pm and the hostess said there was happy hour at the bar/lounge til closing = PERFECT!  We sat at the bar and our bartender, Anthony, was so friendly and great from the start. BF ordered beer and I ordered one (maybe 3 more) of the specialty cocktails that Anthony had recommended.  I can never say no to grilled octopus so that was the immediate choice for me; BF is a sucker for scallops; and our third app, crispy gnocchi, was chosen from its popularity on Yelp reviews.  Octopus kind of shocked me because it was whole baby octopus. It didn't shock me because of the head or anything (I'm Asian, I've seen that before) but, only cuz I've only seen them served like that at Asian buffets...not nice/cute restaurants like this. Anyways, the octopus was ok; scallops were superb but, the crispy gnocchi was my fave! Despite my dislike for pesto, this pesto sauce was pretty good...not to pesto(y) and very creamy!  I was quite full from all the apps but, we had to order the spicy seafood pasta and shrimp po'boy. The shrimp from the shrimp po'boy was crispy and had a good batter on it. Spicy seafood pasta was the hit of the night...Just enough kick and spice to my liking. Wish I could bathe in that sauce!  I can not rave enough about this place. Great local business with amazing food and even better workers. Hoping this local business stays open and I'll be there as often as I can to help it so.",

First, the service was extremely slow.  After we were sat in a booth, no server came over to ask for our drink order (we had to place the order with another server who was dropping off water, which was about 10 minutes after we had arrived - and no, the restaurant was not busy).  Second, the time to put in our food order substantial amount of time (I think we ended up being there for almost 3 hours).  Finally, the dishes were really underwhelming.  While the price point at the restaurant is attractive, the food is mediocre.  I'll just go to Distill in Southern Highlands for better food, better service, and an overall better experience.",

The drinks were amazing and the food was sooooo delicious. My friends surprised me with a cake that Chris later that night set up and brought out for me.

Five star worthy, regrettably their restroom needs some serious help. The restroom was filthy not to mention your unable to lock the door. It appeared to be a quiet evening as well.  Aside from the restroom issue the remainder of the evening was relaxing. The service was fast and efficient, the menu is very diverse, the food was amazing lots of delightful flavors and did I mention how inexpensive this restaurant is? #WalletFriendly  Cheese & Spinach Ravioli $11 (The Alfredo sauce is nice and creamy) Truffle Corn $7 Omg! My absolute fave! Zucchini Stick $5 Crispy & Hot just how they should be! Cheese Plate $11 The raspberry sauce is the highlight of the platter. So yummy! Grapes & Arugula Flatbread $9 Deliciousness  Calamari $10 The calamari didn't knock my socks like I hoped! Skip it... Asian Chicken Salad $8 Steak Diane $19 Steak was cook well beyond the medium rare request but my friend enjoyed it.  $115+ Tip Including Sangria & Mojitos! Of course I'll be back.",

They serve food late, the food is delicious, the menu is diverse, and the service is strong. What more could you ask for in the real City that never sleeps!?!?  The Sparklings has the Best Salmon I've had in Vegas so far. The lemon butter capers sauce with sticky rice goes so well with the seared salmon.  The seared scallops with the miniature crispy rice cakes are a score too.  The chicken rice broccoli casserole is <a href=\"/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2Fbomb.com&s=bb4f996415a9c2f21137e27cfb68f439a48cec2652b53e9b50dd7e766dbe177e\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">bomb.com</a>-worthy when you need a hot meal that taste like it's from Mom or Grandma pot luck kitchen menu. I friggin love it. We get one to go all the time for the next day or two.  Last time we went here we caught a lucky break with a happy hour moscato. Like $4-5 a glass at the bar, can't beat that.  We've had ravioli's & cesears salad as well, and my girl loved it all too.   Remember, we are showing up to this place at 9 o clock, 10pm, 11pm, 12am & they are slinging out bomb food! That's clutch.  Booze & 420 makes everything taste so much better, but this place is solid sober & burnt out too. Don't take my word for it, go try it yourself.   Did I mention it's not as pricey as I expected? It's reasonable price wise in my opinion.   Sparklings owners, I want 1% of all future sales whenever a new customer states they decided to try out your place after reading this yelp review. Ok, ok, ok, I'll settle for one comp'd meal.  Don't change a thing Sparklings, your restaurant rocks!",

The name half makes me think of a scary movie...(like the shining or something) and I was half expecting to be afraid because I was driving down Rainbow's dark street for a while...BUT NOPE WE'RE GOOD! Good, lit plaza with a sign very easy to see and Ample amounts of parking.   The decor inside reminds me of a beautiful, very classy living space, which currently is decorated festively for December. We went here for my cousin's masters graduation in which she reserved a long table for all of us, and the place did not disappoint!   My cousins said the drinks were tasty, and we all agreed that the dishes we ordered were DELICIOUS. Very well seasoned, juicy meats, beautiful to look at, and great portions that left us full after devouring our entrees.   Looks like this place is good for large groups (you can reserve tables as well as bigger the bar area) and smaller intimate groups. (Ran into my coworker just having a good dinner and drinks with his old friend on our way out!) Looks like a good hangout, celebration, and dinner spot!   My only suggestion for this place would be to make sure the food comes out together. My food as well as my brothers food came out last and most of our family was waiting for ours before they started eating. My brother even got the same dish as my cousin and it came out way later. (When we joke that they're still trying to catch the chicken and breed it, you know it's been too long and we're hungry!)",

The whole place has a really nice vibe and unique look plus it has a perfect setup that gives you a bit more privacy than other restaurants and isn't overly loud so you can actually enjoy yourself.

    "text": "I made a last-minute reservation here for my mom's birthday over Thanksgiving weekend and was pleasantly surprised with how nice our experience was. Nice location far off the Strip and the interior/ambiance really reflects that. We had a party of 8 (including one toddler) and they gave us a table with a huge booth.   Our table started off with a calamari dish and some bruschetta (it had lobster in it) as appetizers. I would 200% order that calamari again - super flavorful, and the batter was nice and light. The bruschetta was tasty but hard to split as there were only four pieces for the 8 of us. We ended up breaking off little pieces and sharing those. True family style!  I ordered a Shepherd's Pie which I really liked, and my brother got a chicken/mushroom cream pasta which everyone at our table kept trying. So good...   Our server offered three different choices of dessert for the birthday celebration: cheesecake (which we picked), chocolate cake, and one other I can't remember right now. They wrote a nice \"Happy Birthday!\" on the dessert plate, and my mom happily took a photo with it. After dinner, our server was nice enough to take a photo of our group standing together in the restaurant.  We'll be back! I want to order more small plate type dishes next time, since I think that's where their originality really shines.",

    "text": "What a yummy lunch. A buddy and I stopped in here for lunch on a weekday and we were surprised about how empty it was. We were practically the only ones in the place.  I was pretty impressed by the decor. It flowed together in an interesting way. Blue velvet seating lined one wall, a chandelier hung over our booth, one section served as a semi private eating area with a great pink and green color scheme. It was pretty fun.   I absolutely loved that they offered smaller portioned bites at a decent cost. I am more of a \"pick at your food\" type of person, and the menu allowed me to order a few different things without spending a fortune.   We shared the Crispy Pesto Gnocchi, which was my favorite. The gnocchi was perfectly soft on the inside and fried slightly on the outside. Smothered in a creamy pesto sauce with peas and walnuts, I could eat this dish every day (but I won't!). It was a smaller portion and perfect for sharing.   We also ordered the calamari and the Grapes and Arugula Flat Bread. The calamari was okay. It wasn't oily or too fried, but it was a little bit average. The flatbread was absolutely amazing. The combination of the sweet grapes with savory ricotta and walnuts was perfect. Topped with a bed of leafy greens, this flatbread had a nice balance to it.  I also ordered a Blueberry Mojito. It was certainly tasty, but it was slightly watered down. I am interested in checking out their wines next time.  All in all the food was great. I am curious to check out the place when it isn't quite as slow.",

    "text": "Just ate here based off of other Yelp reviews.  Was looking for a restaurant off-strip close to where my parents live for Mother's Day dinner.  Wish my experience was like other reviewers, but there were some big red flags for me here.  1. Sunday night and the restaurant wasn't even half-full.  I suppose you could argue that it was a Sunday, but I don't think 8:30 is late, especially on a weekend and a holiday.  You could also argue its new, so perhaps people don't know about it, but the manager said it's been open for seven months...  2.  Very strange decor:  I dig the high ceilings with exposed rafters and industrial looking fans.  But then there's a huge crystal chandelier in the middle of the space.  There's other modern touches, but then there's always some strange old-fashioned thing mucking it up, like tacky gold frames, more gold light fixtures, and multicolored pastel painted walls.  It's like someone wanted to decorate a restaurant inspired from the apartment from \"Friends.\"  Add to that the bizarre layout--it's almost one big room with not much privacy at your table, but then again, when you walk in, there's a gigantic piece of floor real estate that could be a dance floor.    3.  Menu is all over the place.  I don't know why, I thought it was going to be Italian, based off of other reviews and the photo I saw of the menu pasta section.  But it's definitely not Italian, nor any specific cuisine.  There is Italian on the menu, along with French, American, and even Hawaiian, so said our waiter.  In fact, when questioned, the waiter told us there is no real theme and that they try to give everyone a bit of everything.  That seems unfocused and generic to me.    4.  Biggest red-flag is that while the three of us still had appetizers we were eating, the waiter brought our three mains at the same time.  Our waiter was a nice guy, but how could he make such a faux pas?  I mean, surely he would have known that he had not taken our apps plates--that Hell, we hadn't even finished them yet.  To me, that's a terrible sign of a restaurant because it means the timing wasn't right, and I wonder how much of our entrees were pre-cooked and re-heated for them to come out so fast?   Not sure who's to blame for the lapse in etiquette, but either way, doesn't look good on the kitchen or the wait staff.  Plus, waiter didn't apologize for this or even seem to be aware that you just can't that.    As for the food itself, pretty mediocre.  Clam and Spinach dip was intensely rich and could've used less cheese, especially since half the order came with deep fried pita bread.  Zuchinni sticks were ok.  French onion soup was the opposite of the dip--not rich enough.  I had the salmon entree, and while the salmon was cooked perfectly, I thought the cream sauce it was served in was old-fashioned and cloying; Mom had linguine with clams, which is pretty hard to mess up; and Dad had braised short-ribs, which were served cold.  I suppose a restaurant can't cook short-ribs to order, so obviously they need to re-heat what was cooked earlier, but you'd think they could get the temp right, especially since they rushed out the entree as mentioned above.  I feel bad to write a negative review because I really wanted to like this local restaurant that's in a great location for people who want to avoid the Strip.  But I certainly wouldn't go back, not unless at a minimum the menu was revamped and refocused.",

And no, I'm not a good cook. -Crispy gnocchi: 4/5 good pesto, good gnocchi. but not exceptional -meatball wrapped in date and bacon: 4/5 also just solid.  -spicy seafood pasta: 3.5/5 good, but nothing special. I mean honestly, is spicy seafood pasta ever not good? -dessert trio: 2/5 this fell pretty flat for me. The chocolate cake was meh. the creme brulee was meh. brulee was thick and hard, not light and crunchy. and creme was not super creamy...more eggy. ice cream utterly ordinary.  I still think it's a great restaurant for the area but unfortunately if these three things are the best dishes the Sparklings has to offer, I'm not that interested in coming back.",

Not perfect, but less than $50 bill for 5 items is impressive.  - Crispy Gnocchi - creamy pesto, Italian sausage, peas and crushed candied walnuts $7.5 (4/5) - Crab & Spinach Dip - grilled and fried pita bread $8 (3.5/5) - Lobster Bisque - served with wonton crisps and green onions, sour cream optional $9 (2.5/5) - Steak Salad - petite filet, spinach, red onion, feta cheese, apple and white vinaigrette $10 (3/5) - Shrimp Po Boy Sandwich - shrimp tempura, remoulade, lettuce and tomato $8.5 (3/5)",

    "text": "\"I'm not in the mood for a Crystal, Diamond, Amber, or Jade at Sapphire.  No, not my Destiny.\"  I say to laughs from the guys and one \"you're a pig\" from the lone female in our group.  \"You have to call me that because you're a girl\". I giggle.  \"Oooh, and I want food\".  \"Fine\" she continues.  \"let's go to Sparklings\".  \"Oooh Sparklings\". I coo, more laughter from the guys.  \"It's not that kind of place... pig\" she concludes.  Contemporary meets country sheik.  With it's strong feminine vibe, it's the perfect place for a local, ladies night out.  Guys, you'll understand the appeal.  The food leans towards sensibly portioned Cali cuisine with just right amount of bad for the health to be Vegas.  The classic bacon wrapped dates becomes a delicious bacon wrapped meatball with dates.  No longer bite size, the ground meat a little dry in texture but the combination with the tomato sauce is very good.  Continuing with starters, a warm flatbread smeared with ricotta cheese and overloaded with arugula, halved seedless grapes, and candied walnuts then drizzled with a balsamic reduction is well executed.  A salad you can hold with the right contrast of sweetness to tangy cheese, crunch to tender, bitter greens.  The other standout is the crispy gnocchi served in a pea pure, creamed pesto with bits of Italian sausage and crushed candied walnuts.  Again, it strikes a great textural balance.  The brown butter sage gnocchi is also worthy.  The fries miss the mark.  The Truffle Parm taste of synthetic truffle oil, the Portobello fries, soggy, and the zucchini sticks overly crisp on the outside, overcooked and wet on the inside.  Small list of mains including a loco moco with demi instead of brown gravy (win!)  Tried all, no real standout, no real complaints.  Good, off Strip service.  Very fair prices.  I left feeling happier than a pig in... you get the idea.",

    "text": "We came in on Friday night for date night, not really sure what to expect except what we had read on Yelp. It was pretty busy so we couldn't get a seat in the bar area. The dining room was busy too so we grabbed a drink while we waited for a table to open up. It took about 10 minutes to get a drink, and by that time a table had opened up for us. Our server, Clayton, was super nice even though he seemed a bit frantic.   We ordered crispy gnocchi, bacon-wrapped meatballs, spicy seafood pasta and the short ribs. Everything was fantastic, except the pasta was JUST OK. It was good, it just tasted like something I could easily make at home and there wasn't that much seafood in it.   The ambiance is a bit strange. It's beautiful inside, but also kind of weird at the same time. The decor doesn't completely mesh, but somehow it's still cozy. I will say though, they should turn the music up a notch and dim the lights a notch as well.   For our drinks, we ordered the bourbon mule, which I surprisingly liked even more than the vodka version, moscow mule. Clayton never left us hanging and checked on us JUST enough. At the end of the meal, our bill was about $75, which is not bad at all. We will definitely be coming back but we decided this is more of a hang out in the lounge and order a few drinks and food items from the apps list, not so much a romantic dinner type place.",

We started off with the grapes, arugula and ricotta flat bread. The flat bread was barely warm which made it hard to eat because the ingredients kept rolling off. It was over dressed with balsamic vinaigrette and needed a drizzle instead of a pour. The ingredients in this dish had the ability to work well together but the dish just ended up tasting unsophisticated. For our mains we ordered the chicken Parmesan and the Philly cheesesteak.   Once again, both dishes were unrefined.   Chicken Parmesan-  dish was under seasoned, breading was soggy at the bottom and crispy on the top making me think the chicken was not freshly breaded,it was dry  Philly cheesesteak- the low quality of meat and bread was evident. It came with a spring salad that had no dressing and a pickle spear sitting on top. Even if you like pickles I don't think anyone wants it seeping into their salad.   It's too bad that the food does not deliver because they did a great job on the theme.",

Boys.  The food was decent, nothing super spectacular.  Apparently they only have a few tea pots, so a few ladies (including the mom to be) couldn't get tea because they had them all out with the *other* baby shower luncheon that was going on across the dining room.  Seriously?  And there is also no coffee, just espresso or americano.  You can't get a latte or cappuccino either.  However, people were enjoying their special cocktails so I guess at least they have the bar going on for them.",

But I hate to say that I cannot agree with these reviews. Upon arrival I thought that the atmosphere seemed charming with its decoration, although it looks nice it really felt as though there was a lot missing at the same time.    While waiting for the rest of our party I sat with a friend at the bar, the bartender was great- very friendly and delightful.   We then made out way to the table and I was thankful I had my drink from the bar as it took quite a while to even get a drink order placed and then quite a while to get the actual order. I shared quite a few food options with two other friends, and the food was okay, I cannot say that I really enjoyed any of the selections to recommend.   The service here was very bland, and lacking quite a bit.  I was really anxious to try a new establishment, but I have to say that I was not at all impressed. Overall, I left the restaurant with a feeling of confusion.",

Thanks to the mgmt for a such a nice employees. Good hiring. I think the bad reviews I see here is because some people have bad days and they are looking something or someone to blame.

Service was good and food came out in a timely fashion. Only reason I didn't give 5 stars was upon check in I did have to wait a while before being addressed. The hostess came over from the bar area so I'm assuming he was covering both areas... but other than that it was very pleasant and a fun place for a date night!",

The carte was extensive and after saying, i am looking for something VEGAN. The servet bartender point me at couple suggestions, no main dishes but I went for the pasta with olive oil and garlic. Food arrived to the table. Evetything look good, mothing special and exciting but fresh and everybody was happy. My pasta was absolutly delicious and i even say \" that wasv he best pasta I ever ate.\". The sauce was pretty thick and i had hard time to believe it was not butter. One of my friend said: if this is good, its because of the butter. Then I adked the server who vonfirm it was no butter, just olive oil, but went to check with the chef to make sure. Came back to the table and redescribe tge pasta : they are made with Extra virgin oil, garlic, white wine, and CHIKEN STOCK.  You must see my face and the good laught of my friends. To be honest I was not even angry, it was so big and laughable... I said, thats good, at least there is no butter.  Price are good to. When we went out, everybody had the same reflection about the lighting. The lighting is Horible ! Please hire a professionel to adap the apropriate watts dosage for your restaurant. Overhall, the food was descent, service ok and modetate price. Not sure if I will come back since there is nothing special who will make come back. It deserve a 3 1/2 stars.",

Waited forever for the food, which did not all come out at the same time. I reluctantly looked down at my plate to see 3 oz piece of salmon over a small cup of rice. I informed the server that the salmon was not the 7oz that was portrayed on the menu, and he simply looked at me, and walked away without a reply. I have dined at this restaurant at least 6 or 7 times before--and have never had this bad of service or food quality. Christian is a terrible server, and I do not appreciate the attitude to such a loyal customer.   I will not be dining here again any time soon.",

We came in after church and ordered the BBQ wings, Brussel sprouts and pancetta, and the jambalaya. It was flavorful and the portions were big enough to share. My son enjoyed his kids meal, bow tie with cream sauce, which was surprisingly good that he ate it all. The restaurant wasn't busy so I expected the server to be more attentive than he was. Maybe it's because we didn't do bottomless? Whatever it was, the basic filling the water and asking if we needed anything was prolonged than usual experiences. Overall, I'd like to come back in the near future to do bottomless and eat some of their other dishes.",

    "text": "I loved our dining experience here. My husband and I moved here from Chicago and feel like it's truly difficult to find nice restaurants in the neighborhood without having to go downtown. You're left with a lot of chains in the suburbs, but the Sparklings really hit the mark on food quality and service.         Now, when we go out, it's typically just the two of us. We also make reservations in advance, and overall try to avoid the peak times. These are all things that are simply common sense if you want to ensure expedient service.    If you go in a big party, your food will take longer, because of all the orders from your table being made, this isn't a chain with prepackaged foods, that's why you came here instead of your local Outback or whatever.         If you didn't make a reservation, and walk in on a Friday night, you're going to have to wait for a table.   If you come in on Sunday morning for bottomless mimosas like every other Becky in the restaurant, don't expect it to be refilled the instant you  guzzle that bottom of the barrel champagne because \"you want to get your moneys worth\".   Now I'll admit, there are places I'll never return to based on repetitive occurrences of poor quality, or just absolutely abysmal service,  but reading some the 1 star reviews, I can not believe the entitlement.  Most of the reviewers that give 1 star I find, basically always give 1 star.  Honestly, you can't take anyone serious who has more than half of their reviews being 1 star.   Like, if you always have a bad service experience when you go out, look at the common denominator!  What's the x factor? Find a mirror and see that the problem is you.   Rant over.   But really, if you want something delicious and different, try this place for sure.",

We decided on ordering a bunch of things and shared family style, most of the options we chose were done well. A few misses: our table was kind of private, set back between two walls which was cool, but we didn't realize we were in Antarctica until the AC kicked on and blew directly at our table, making most of the party uncomfortably cold. Secondly, we saw the food runner more than our waiter; it wasn't until we commented on that fact that the waiter finally reappeared! Reminder to all those who work in the service industry in Vegas (especially off-strip), 80% of you customers work in the industry too and will be holding you at a high standard!",

    "text": "So updating my original review. I'm sure the food is still excellent but I wouldn't know since the last two times I've tried to dine here it's been closed for a private event.   Normally this wouldn't have bothered me, the first time they were polite enough to have posted a sign saying they were closed for the afternoon which was perfectly acceptable.   The second time I made sure to call in advance because I didn't want to make the drive all the way over there to be turned away again. The gentleman on the phone said they were open for normal business hours. Great! I said and almost hung up but then he mentioned the dining area was closed for a private event but we could still sit at the bar and we could still eat there. That option was fine with us so we left to eat there.   When we arrived we were told that there was a private event and they were closed. I said I just called and that the person on the phone said we could eat at the bar. However to get to the bar we had to walk through the private event which was very awkward. No one else was there aside from the private party so we ended up leaving.   I get it... Places get bought out. It's a cute atmosphere... But this type of miscommunication shouldn't be happening. If a place is bought out, it's bought out. I guess we *could* have sat at the bar but it was extremely awkward and clearly the entire place was supposed to be only for that party.   Maybe one day I'll actually get to eat there again.... Maybe.",

    "text": "Soooooooo, long story short it's average food with a cute cute dining room, good drinks/service but nothing really blew me away.  The meatball appetizer was great. It had a bunch of flavor and I sincerely wanted more. The crab and spinach dip should be renamed to just the spinach dip because I didn't get any crab at all (my husband said he had a bite) and it wasn't as creamy as I personally prefer, it was very cheesy but it was still good. I did like that they give fried and regular pita bread for dipping. Nice touch. The Tuna tartare was also good, the mango was different. Clam chowder was good as well. The filet was larger than I expected and cooked as requested but I was just missing some flavor on the steak itself. I like the char with seasoning or the buttery flavor on my steak. It wasn't bad at all just a little plain for my liking. I did not ask for any steak sauce which is always a good sign.  We will probably come back because I can almost see this place from the third floor of my house but the only thing I'd order again would be the meatballs. They were the 2nd best meatballs I've had in my life. I'd really like to try their pasta or perhaps a sandwich because I believe that there's a lot of effort put into the menu and overall quality.",

The food was good but I agree with another review that the appetizers were better than the entrees and next time I think we will just do apps and cocktails.   The staff all seemed new to working in a restaurant and a bit nervous.  I felt that our server was much too casual with us and the conversation felt border line inappropriate for dining.  There were a few little kinks they need to work out (example- we didn't get a chiller when we ordered a bottle of white wine) but I'm sure things will keep getting better the longer they're open.",

Perfect for a date or even a big group.   My bf and tried a few appetizers, the flourless cake and a few beers. The gnocchi was my favorite and the meatballs were my bf's favorite. The pesto sauce in the gnocchi was so so good. I dipped everything else in it. I can't wait to try the salmon and a few other items on my next trip back,   I saw the bar on my way out and am for sure going to try some of the cocktails too. It looked so relaxing and chill.

    "text": "The first time i went here was for my birthday. Although the restaurant was quiet empty the host gave us an option to sit in the bar area since we had a party of 14 people and he said it would be faster service if we sat there. Reluctantly we agreed to sit there.  The ambience was amazing, i loved the decor. However the food was nothing but average and the service was still terrible even though there were barely any people.  The second time was more recently. I solely decided to go back because i love the ambience. upon entering we saw the restaurant was completely empty on a friday night. We sat in the dinning area. With just one server managing the bar area and the dining area needless to say the service yet again was terrible.  My boyfriend ordered a quesadilla without the chicken ( we confirmed the order to ensure there were no errors due to him being a strict vegetarian)  and I ordered mashed potatoes and club sandwich. The mashed potatoes were good but just a bit dry. The club sandwich was just terrible and to top it off they gave us chicken in the quesadilla . Unknowingly my boyfriend who is a vegetarian ate a whole piece before we saw a piece of chicken in the quesadilla. We waited a good 10 minuets before we went upto the owner who was fixing the door and asked him to send the server. The server was busy at the bar area and came over 10 minuets later, by this time we were just sitting waiting and the food was completely cold. The server apologized and rushed to the kitchen and said they messed it up. He then brought out a veggie quesadilla and that was it. No apologies by the owner, nothing was taken off our check, no words were exchanged we just paid and left. I was highly disappointed that they did not even understand the extent of disappointment they caused for someone who has been a vegetarian their whole life. Never going back again.",

This place was amazing! I'm staying at the MGM and so I was spending a ton of money on food prior to this restaurant. It's a bit further from the strip but totally worth it! I started off the Zucchini sticks -- amazing!! For my meal I got the turkey and cranberry sandwich, also amazing! Even took half home for lunch tomorrow and for dessert I got the creme brulee it hit the spot! I also had the Voo doo cocktail. Deep Eddy Grapefruit Vodka and muddle raspberries -- so good! I was extremely satisfied with this! It had a quite little ambiance, you felt fancy but you weren't breaking the bank! I didn't catch our server but he was amazing as well!! If I'm ever back in Vegas, I will definitely go back to the Sparkling!!",

The outside of the building looked plain, but as you enter thru the double glass doors, something spectacular awaits you.  The young man, Ray, greeted us politely and lead us to the dinning area to be seated.  In the center of the dinning room was a gorgeous crystal chandelier. Underneath were various sizes of glass vases with beautiful pink and white orchids and roses. It was a reminisce of a Paris cafe. They had separate dinning rooms for larger parties. Our  waiter, Jason, was funny and courteous. Our order came in a timely manner. We ordered truffle fries to start with. They were very crunchy on the outside and soft inside, just the way I liked fries. The portion for the truffle fries was not that big. Then our meals were served. Presentation was great.  I must say my favorite was the jambalaya. It was very tasty. The ribeye steak was cooked just right and the Cajun chicken and shrimp pasta was delicious as well.  Pricing is reasonable. The manager, Andy, even came up to our table and ask how everything was. Our overall experience was wonderful. Will definitely visit this place again.",

We had a beet and apple pizza which was ok, not great and not bad.  I had the club sandwich on the recommendation of the server and it was pretty good.  Wife had a brie and ham sandwich (i think that is what was in it) and she said it was also good.    There were a lot of families with young kids in there dining which was great, but the place was half empty on a Saturday at 7 pm.   I hope it was an anamoly and that it stays busy.

Unfortunately, we didn't enjoy that particular dish, WAY too fishy in taste, as if the crab hadn't been prepared correctly. However, we then tried the cheese platter to go with the amazing bottle of wine we ordered, and it did not disappoint! A very nice array of cheeses, grapes, & nuts. We also tried a salad, for the life of me I can't remember the name, & that was excellent as well. The bartender was very friendly & outgoing.

And we had the flourless chocolate cake, it was ok, didn't have any fresh berries on it... all too meh....  The service was good.

Stale shabby chic. The restroom also not very clean and run down. They do have a good selection of beer on tap and some decent wines, but dang, way over priced!

I came with a few girlfriends and we ordered a bunch of food and shared it among us! The zucchini and portobello fries were to die far! We also tried the crab dip and it was okay a little too fishy for me though. We also ordered the shrimp po boy and omg it was AMAZING. The bread was so soft and the sauce on it was delicious! We ordered the Rice Au Gratin with Chicken and it was alright! I would definitely come back because this place is so cute and for a very reasonable price! There was only two waiters so I would probably go at another time when there was more because the service was a little slower than what I normally like.",

The gnocchi was the star of the show. Fries were soggy, scallops were a total let-down (the plate came with TWO scallops and four scallop-imposter rice cakes). A few items were missing from the salads. Our server was slow despite us letting him know we were headed to a movie and despite the early hour. It wasn't even busy. We ended up having to split up so one person could wait for the check and the rest could head to the theatre. And we all left semi hungry and unsatisfied.   I do like the open, spacious and well-lit dining room. And I love the idea of the semi-private dining areas-would be great for birthday dinners, etc. They have a good start on the decor, but I think they could benefit from a professional designer to really make it work.",

It's decorated very elegantly without it being over bearing.   Vibe: Great place to catch up with that friend you haven't seen in a awhile. Intimate but not too romantic.   Customer service & food: Service at the tables have always been okay, the bar on the other hand does a stellar job keeping the guest entertained. I'm a boring BEWB and tend to stick with the sandwiches. Pretty solid stuff. Their gnocchi's on the other hand are superb and always a staple when I eat here.

I had three dishes there: a Caesar salad, the bacon and date-wrapped meatballs and the crispy gnocchi. All three were excellent! The service was prompt and friendly, and they take a lot of pride in their food. They have a lot of tapas-type offerings and a very pleasant dining atmosphere.

We were seated promptly and greeted by a friendly bartender.  On the way in, we walked through the dining room. Another reviewer described the interior as shabby chic, and we agreed. High ceilings, funky, fun furniture and a good amount of space between tables left an impression that this would be a great spot for larger groups of friends.  The cocktails we ordered were good and tasty, but a touch on the sweet side. The bartender warned us about one particular drink in that was VERY sweet, so we steered clear of that one. They did have a fine beer and and wine selection as well.  We ordered 3 appetizers and one main course. We began with the truffle fries, the bacon and date wrapped meatballs, the arugula and walnut flatbread, and finally, the jambalaya.  Everything was ok. Nothing really stood out, however. I'd call it bland, really, except for the negative connotation of the word. So, a shade tastier than bland. The jambalaya especially had virtually no spice in it at all. The fries and the flatbread were probably the most flavorful -- the fries due to their garlic, herbs and truffle oil and the flatbread had amazing fresh basil.  The jambalaya did arrive already split on two plates for us which was a nice touch. We were too full for desert afterwards. The three apps, one main course, and four total drinks (two for each of us) came to about $60.  We look forward to returning as they are open late (2:00 am most nights I think) and sampling again from the menu.",

    "text": "The Sparkling has a great concept and a lot of potential, but not quite there yet. My friend and I came here Saturday night for dinner and our expectations fell short on the ambiance, menu items, and service. Unfortunately the reviews written thus far are very misleading. In fact, I'm a bit disappointed with Yelp for the first time in a long time.  Food: The food is not bad, but you are definitely getting what you pay for. We decided to do 4-5 of their appetizers to get a taste of the menu.  Not the best choice. The caprese salad had Roma tomatoes that were thin and not quite ripe yet, the brown butter gnocchi were dry and tasted like frozen tater tots that were re-heated. You would think that with an item description of \"Brown Butter Gnocchi with Butternut squash\"  it would have some time of sauce or butter?  Nope...just dry gnocchi and dried out, over cooked, roasted butternut squash cubes.  Our saving grace was the smoke salmon crostini and meatballs.   Service:   We had an issue with one of our courses and the server seemed a bit put out and offended with our feedback and then what made the matter worse is the manager came by after it was fixed and from 5 feet away said \"are you better now?\" And then walked off. Don't get me wrong he was NICE about it and did his \"table touch\" as a professional gesture, but a further conversation on what was wrong with our dish seemed more appropriate for a slow night than a shouted conversation across the room. From then on we were ignored by the manager while he laughed and danced his way from every other table in the restaurant.  The whole restaurant had maybe 5 tables total and the server had each course coming out so fast and we felt rushed the whole time.  The server was very nice, but definitely not polished.  Ambience: Very cute decor concept with the French, Country sheek theme, but the beautiful valour chairs and stunning Chandelier did not pair well with the paper napkins and casual waitstaff attire .  Also, the bar area is distracting with the TV's and loud people.  Perhaps the restaurant could have a curtain/wall up to block the view for people on a romantic date night and a separate entrance for the bar area, so  the drunk people stumbling in don't have to walk by my table acting/dressing like they are at PT's.  I will try it again once they're on their feet longer maybe for a happy hour, but wouldn't recommend it as of now to a friend.   Last comment... Can we take down the Xmas tree/decor now? It's January 12th.",

Food tasted, looked and felt amazing. I was looking for an Alfredo pasta fix, and this place absolutely did it with its Tempura Shrimp and Mushroom pasta-AAMMAAZZZZE. It's heavy, but so incredibly delicious with a kick of lemon. I'd recommend as a cheat meal:) Had the zucchini sticks to start, and it came with ranch and some spicy creamy sauce. All were excellent (and I'm not much for ranch, but this was yummy). Also tried the brown sugar gnocchi. This was ok. I don't know much about gnocchi so I couldn't tell you much except that it tasted fine, but seemed like it could have had more taste. Portions were great, including the trio dessert (which was also wonderful). Best of all, price point! As a local joint and has a local, I would expect nothing more or less than the prices set here. Excellent place to bring girlfriends, or for a date. There's a bar area that looked cool, but I didnt actually visit that part. I would absolutely make another visit, and recommend to friends and guests. This is a four star review based on this initial visit.",

I think they were short handed though there were a few times we waited for our server and then he brought the check before I got to see the dessert menu. He quickly apologized and brought one right over and good thing he did. Like I said the chocolate good was delicious. Looking forward to having that again.",

Best part is that it's open late, with bar and kitchen open till 2am.  I wish I could've given this place 5 stars!  The only mess up was the rib eye steak was over cooked and looked like it belonged in a $2.99 steak and egg special.  The wife and I shared truffle fries, meatballs, scallops, rib eye steak (which we sent back to the kitchen, and braised pork ribs.  The Truffles Fries were my favorite, plenty of garlic! Definitely tasted Asian fusion.  Meatballs were very good, could've been a little softer.  The marinara sauce was on the sweeter side, but I didn't mind it.  Scallops are a must!  Perfection indeed.  The seasoning and the way it was cooked was on point.  Ribeye was the worst part of our meal, and we had to send it back to the kitchen because it was cooked well done (we asked for medium).  There was no flavor and the look of the steak was ugly.  We replaced the steak with the braised pork.  The pork and sauce was amazing, and a huge rebound from the rib eye steak.  So overall, we will be coming back and recommending this place to everyone we know!  We will just let everyone know, not to order the rib eye steak!",

The bar usually fills up pretty quickly, but every time I've visited, the restaurant is usually no more than half full.   The menu has a wide assortment of dishes from chicken to steak to fish, but also with a large emphasis on pasta. The meatballs (also available as an appetizer) are very flavorful and moist.   On my most recent visit, I sampled the Salmon with White Rice and Lemon Caper Sauce, and it was delicious! The salmon and the rice were cooked perfectly, and the flavors all melded together really well to make for a great dish.   The staff is also very attentive and friendly. I don't think I've ever had to ask for a refill out of the few times I've visited. And the staff always makes sure everything is up to par!   Overall, if you live in Mountains Edge, or on the Southwest side of town, this is a bit of a hidden gem! The prices are fairly reasonable too! Give it a shot and see what you think! It might become your new favorite!",

It's got a super cute, glam meets rustic meets eclectic vibe with comfy bench seating and chandeliers. Super trendy decor!!   I went with a groups of 8 or 9 and we were sat in a private dining room at a big table with giant comfy dining chairs. Because there were so many of us, food was a little slow to come out, but everything I tried was so good!! The pricing was unbelievably cheap too. I ended up getting 3 small plates/appetizers and my meal was less than $20! Amazing. The day we went, they had run out of champagne for bottomless mimosas, but that is an offering that I look forward to taking advantage of... maybe during brunch!   Our server was friendly and dealt with our ridiculous and slightly rowdy group with much more patience than I would have. He kept our drinks filled up, without being overbearing. When people wanted more food, the food was more prompt than the first time around.   We were told that they are reworking the menu a bit, but I don't know if that's happened. I wouldn't be surprised. They had a LOT of options and it was all really reasonably priced.   Looking forward to going back soon!",

It's a modern twist of romantic old english, southern, old world kinda  charm. This restaurant can accommodate large groups but I recommend making a reservation for your event in advance. The waiter was kind enough to spilt our checks and was super patient with a table full of about 15 ladies celebrating something special.",

Hidden off of Jones, The Sparklings reminded me of a house ... a clean and comfy house where you could order just what foods fit your palette and made you feel at home!   Our server was very friendly and accommodating. He put together sides that were dairy free and flexatarian for me while slapping sides that my little one would eat together (they had elote so I asked for just corn on the cob with a side of rice and a side of peas - toddlers can be so picky!) I also tried the calamari salad which was my favorite! My husband had the seafood ravioli which is scarfed down in two seconds. Our family tried different dishes including the traditional turkey meal and no one had any complaints!   The drink menu had much to choose from and we found a red wine to share at the table as well!  We will definitely be back to visit and try more on the Sparklings menu!",

I drive by here all the and I can't believe I've never gone in. What struck me the most was that it was a Barstruant! How cute! There's a bar + a restaurant in the corner of the location. I ordered the shrimp scampi and portion was good. Although there weren't many workers and over 20 in our group, it seems as if they knew what they were doing even if it took a little time. Their food tasted delicious and they had sweet service! I hope to come back soon and explore more of their menu.",

    "text": "WOW! I've lived down the street from Sparklings for a year, and regret it's taken me so long to finally eat here.  My boyfriend and I had dinner at 6:30 pm on Friday night. We made reservations, but that wasn't necessary since there were plenty of open tables when we arrived. The traffic started to pick up between 7pm-8pm, so I recommend reservations during that time on Fri and Sat nights.   The ambiance is an even balance between homely and upscale. You'll know what I mean when you get there. Our Server (Chris) was very attentive and knowledgable on recommendations. *Thank you for the wonderful dining experience, Chris!*  We ordered: * Seared Diver Scallops (10/10) for appetizer - I'm not a lemon fan and was worried about the taste since the description said it was made with a \"lemony beurre blanc\". I took a chance, and thankfully the lemon was very subtle, with scallops cooked to perfection!  * Shrimp & Crab Ravioli w/ Vodka Sauce (10/10) - AMAZING sauce and the ravioli was very fulfilling  * Shrimp Tempura & Mushroom Pasta (10/10) - oh my god, the cream sauce is out-of-this-world, making the dish an absolute delicacy.  Overall, Sparklings is my new favorite restaurant and our designated place for treat/cheat meals. Incredible quality and better pricing than eateries on The Strip.",

I had the fried chicken sandwich off the seasonal menu. Perfect size, great flavor and really fair price ($10). The good thing about the menu is I felt like there were another 5 or 6 dishes I want to try.  Next up...the decor, what a beautiful place. Felt like eating in my moms kitchen during the holidays. Lastly, really attentive service. Now. We went on a Monday which is naturally one of the slower days of the week. But great service can never be taken for granted. All in all, love the experience. We will be back!!",

The service was an even odder mix.  It took like 15 minutes to get a drink and our waiter was just uninterested.   Then, when we were ordering entrees, he just turned on and became very engaging.    It was unusual as hell.    The food was really excellent and all of our dishes were enjoyed.   Some of them, like my braised short ribs were priced a bit high ($28) for the portion size.  Others were spot on with price and portion.    I still found this place oddly satisfying and when we are looking for a quirky place for dinner, this is on the list.

    "text": "Myself and a group of friends went there because one of our good friends lives near by and goes a lot apparently. The music they play is awful, it's straight house music 24/7 and not the good house with words ~ the bad repetative techno that you have to be on drugs to enjoy... We asked if they could play any other music, hip hop / rock / top 40 didn't matter, anything but the awful techno ( our entire group of diverse friends agreed ), but the bartender said he didn't want to change it.  My husband was a bit hangry ( grumpy and hungry ) as he had just gotten off work late and he hadn't eaten one thing all day. The bartender ( long, spiked black hair ) allowed our friend who's a regular to order food, but wouldn't let my husband order. My husband gave him a little bit of an attitude but nothing crazy ( he didn't even raise his voice, used no cuss words and didn't even move from his seat ), and the bartender got really upset and told our friend that my husband was 86'ed and that if he came back he would \"break his face.\"  What the.. ??!! We all didn't know where the bartender's reaction / anger was coming from. I was a waitress / bartender for over 10 years and never in my life have I seen someone act so unprofessional. Never-the-less threaten a customer! We just moved close by and had we had a better experience we would have come often, and FYI we spend $$ / never ask for hand outs... None of our friends are going back after that experience..  I feel bad for the owner, according to our friend they've lost a lot of business due to this bartender. Apparently he is very sensitive / defensive and has picked drama with many customers who also chose not to return, but the owner won't fire him because he's been there since it opened..  So between the crazy sensitive bartender who threatens customers and the God awful music, this place is a HELL NO for me!!",

The dessert was a bit disappointing--out of the three trio items, the creme Brule was a bit more tart, the chocolate brownie type item was only average, and the ice cream was just standard ice cream.

    "text": "We were craving American and this was the highest reviewed restaurant around the area. The decor seems nice: lots of lighting, modern, clean, nice and roomy. Service was actually superb despite what the negative review said. We were constantly checked and the staff were extremely cordial. I ordered the spicy seafood pasta and my friend ordered the herb roasted chicken, as appetizers we also got the plate of cheese and fried zucchini. The menu looked delicious, but it's one of those restaurants that the food looked better than it tastes. I'm not sure why, but it definitely lacked that \"umami\" better tasting places offer. I don't want to give a such bad review, but while the food wasn't complete garbage, it was mediocre at best.  To top it off, my friend also had SEVERE food poisoning about 12 hours afterwards. I'm in the medical field and checked my resources with all facts pointing in the direction of food poisoning. We ate around 10 and the symptoms started the next morning around 10, with multiple bouts of diarrhea and vomiting. Actually, it reminded me of this family guy episode where they were trying to see who can drink the most ipecac, which of course resulted in everyone throwing up on top of each other. The episode was hilarious, but unfortunately it cannot be said for real life. Nothing was consumed hours before or after the meal, and there were no other culprits. We're not entirely sure but it seems all signs point to the chicken, which was possibly badly handled during the cooking.  In the end, we were both pretty disappointed at our visit. We should have stuck with one of our regulars. Needless to say, we definitely won't be coming back.",

    "text": "33/2016 Have you ever been someplace you enjoy but yet you really don't? Does that make sense??  First of all I had seen some yelp reviews and bookmarked this place. While on Rainbow decided this was one of those places I wanted to see what it was all about.  When seated it is almost like your in a Internet Cafe, everyone was on their lap tops and phones! Well they have free WiFi so why not?  Anyway, we decided to get a appetizer.  The crab and spinach dip which was $8. Sounded so good! When it came out the waiter made sure to say if we did not have enough pita bread we could order more. Of course for a fee ~ Pita Bread (3pcs) $1 (6pcs) $2. And of course there was not enough so we had to order more. It was very good! Hot and a great taste. There was 2 different ways they serve the pita fried and grilled. Both were good but the fried was really addicting with the dip! Just small triangle pieces not like a plate full, There  was plenty of the dip and worth trying.  Then we ordered the Spaghetti with Meat Sauce which was $11. This came out in a pretty good size bowl and the waiter added some fresh grated cheese if you want. This was also good. Came ala carte . You get nothing else with it. No bread, no salad, nothing. If you request bread you will be charged.  So why 3 stars? Because I do not like places that nickle and dime you for everything. If you want to be a fine dining restaurant then charge a bit more but give people a reason to want to come back! Bread with pasta is a common thing, almost everyplace that serves pasta always serves bread and it is usually always unlimited.  Then with the appetizer ~ why not charge $10 and include enough pita so you don't have to pay more because you did not get enough.  Great atmosphere, nice chandelier hanging but that won't bring us back. The food was good and service was good, hopefully they will make some changes to their menu.  Would we go back? Maybe sometime. Not anytime too soon.",

This last time we waited at least 20-30 mins just to get the check at the tables near the bar after the longest service wait to begin with. My husband called the management a few days after and they seemed uninterested in our complaints, so we will have to take that as a final sign to not repeat our business there. Do not waste the money or time.",

    "text": "Went to The Sparklings on 9/12 for my birthday celebration. Tired of the normal chain restaurants, I wanted something different and cool; something on the fancier side but with a good price point (Nothing seemed to be over $30). And with Yelp's help I found this gem :)    First, the decor is so my style! Very shabby chic meets vintage. That chandiler is amazing (I couldn't stop looking at it) I felt like I was having a relaxed yet upscale dinner in New York with friends. I love the marble table we ate on and the chairs were even super cute. I loved everything about the interior. It wasn't as big as I thought it would be, but for me it created a more private feeling.  Secondly (and most importantly) the food: The food was really good. I ordered the zucchini sticks for an appitizer and had the spaghetti with mushroom and bacon cream sauce for my main course. I'm a big fan of zucchini sticks and these were excellent! Cripsy on the outside, nice and tender on the inside and the sauce that was served with it was amazing. My spaghetti- bomb! Creamy, flavorful, and a good amount of sauce. I also tried some of the grilled chicken wings (which were also excellent) and I appreciated that they were grilled and not fried. My friends enjoyed their food as well. My sister is still raving about the chicken sandwhich she ordered- she said it was one of the best she's ever had (and believe me she's had a few-she loves chicken sandwhiches lol)   The service was good as well (our server Jason was really cool) They were all attentive but didn't hover over us the whole night which I appreciated.   My guest all kept complimenting on the decor and the food which made me really happy, especially considering this was my first time trying it, so it made me feel like I did a good job picking a place and that taking a risk sometimes turns out right :)   My birthday this year was filled with so much laughter, generosity, and happiness and I want to thank The Sparklings for being an intricate part of my special day. And eventough it's clear on the other side of town from me (lol) I can't wait to go back.   Wish you much continued success!",

The decor is very cute and a great place to bring your family or a first date. We sat at the bar and ordered Meomi (pinot nior) which is fantastic! The seafood linguine is a must and so is the beet salad! Since my visit 4 weeks ago I've been here 3 times already! Definitely more visits to come and Jose (bartender) is such a sweetheart!",

Everything was cooked to perfection. We will definitely be back. We are both in the restaurant industry so we will absolutely tell our friends at work to come check this place out. We were so surprised they weren't busy but maybe because they are new. We will definitely make The Sparklings  our new place to hang out! Thanks Crystal. U rock!!",

They had a big table with about 20 people so it was understandable that the food took awhile. But even as everyone cleared out and I was waiting for my bill, and then change, I had to ask twice for someone to help me. There were 4 guys cleaning up and no one really knew who was serving my table. They did comp my drink and ice cream for my patience which was unexpected.

As I teach, customer service and sales for a living, I use Andy as an example often of a WOW customer experience! I have been to Sparklings several times for events and dinner, and EVERY TIME was as good as the first. Consistency is tough, but Sparklings pulls it off. It is super difficult to find ANY business with the level of service that this place has. This last time, my husband and I went in for a glass of wine and dessert. We were seated, and treated just like any customer buying a full fledged dinner. The service was prompt, professional, and the wine is great! the flourless chocolate cake was also \"melt in your mouth\" good! Andy checked on us also, which is always a nice treat and says a lot about his dedication to the service. I highly recommend this place to anyone who takes great pleasure in paying their dollars to a business who understands the needs and takes care of their customer!",

They informed me that I didn't need to reserve a table and that we'll be able to get in if we came right away.    Surprisingly when we got there we were the only table there. I thought they'd be busier but good for us we didn't have to wait.  They sat us at a table right across from the kitchen that was reaping of sewer smell. The floors were wet leading to our table.  As I looked  into the kitchen was when I saw the whole kitchen drenched in some kind of murky water and everyone running around trying to mop the filthy water up.  No wonder the whole place smelled like sewer. At this point I wanted to stand up and leave but didn't want to ruin dinner for everyone else.  We asked to be moved to a table towards  the front door. Out of site out of mind...  We ordered fried calamari which was bland, the octopus appetizer was just ehh. The seafood pasta was flavorless and the noodles were hard.  The clam linguini was ok. The only thing that I can give this place a star for is the decorations. It's simple & cute but smelling like sewer... I'll can pass!",

I know that is nit-picky and a little pretentious but it in no way effected the overall rating, just wanted to point it out.    The food here was good. I was hoping for better but just I kept thinking to myself that it was nothing that blew me away. The one thing I always get if on a menu is the grilled octopus and they had one. It was flavorful with I think a soy sesame sauce but it was a little to tough. The Braised Short rib was also good but not amazing. My favorite thing that night was the Gorgonzola Flatbread with honey.   Also they have a pretty good wine selection and relatively cheap bottles of wine. For that alone I might be back soon.  Maybe they were just having an off night and when I come back it will be more to my liking.",

First off the decor is stunning with plush tufted classic furniture and a giant crystal chandelier... Very nice. Both times we arrived late night and were sat in the bar area which is very inviting and open. Both times we got a man with long dark shaggy hair waiting on us, I wish I caught his name because this man truly understands customer service. Polite, courteous, and attentive are just a few ways to describe the service here. The food is excellent. The pastas are mouth watering and I can't leave without getting the salmon crustinis! This place is sure to leave you with a full stomach without breaking the bank. Give them a try!",

The food was good, the drinks were yummy but our wait person (Susan) ignored us most of the night, even turned and walked away when we called her for some service. There were six of us and it took forever to get our drinks! It took forever to get our order placed, there wasn't any salt or pepper on the table and we kept having to ask repeatedly for some. Plus the kitchen forgot to make one of the dinners! By the time it came every one else was finished eating! Won't go back!! If the owner(s) expect this restaurant to stay in business they had better take service seriously!! Otherwise, no one will be repeat customers and they'll be out of business within six months or less!!   Update: The response from the owner/manager is so ridiculous! Apparently you bailed on your restaurant that evening as we asked for a manager and were told there was none available; that you had left! How convenient! When you say that our order of scallops was late; we were told that the kitchen forgot to make the order! So lies, from either you or your staff! How pathetic! When you say no one in our group knows anything about the restaurant business you are so mistaken! Two to three of us have either owned and or managed restaurants in the past! When you call someone immature for saying that your restaurant may go out of business if the problems are not fixed, you appear to be defensive and pretty damn clueless! Good luck!!",

And the langosta bruschetta had too much creaminess to it. After eating one you can't really eat more. You need to clean your palette with something else because there is too much dairy. I kind of felt sick after eating those.   Because the staff and the atmosphere of the place was so nice, I may give it another try. Hopefully other items taste a lot better.

I typically always get the steak salad, but have tried various other appetizers/entrees/desserts and they have all been so tasty!  I absolutely LOVE the decor in this restaurant as well as their outdoor space... so much so, that when my fiance and I were stressed out from trying to plan our wedding, we decided to have the restaurant host our reception! We worked with Andy and created a wonderful menu and experience for our wedding guests. He was very patient and understanding and just wanted to make sure we were happy. On the day of the reception, he was there for the majority of the time and made sure everything went smoothly. I really could not have had a better experience with Andy and his staff. Although I was nervous at first, since it's not a traditional wedding reception spot, I was pleasantly surprised and elated at the professionalism of everyone involved. Since it's still relatively new, I'd say about 99% of our guests had never been there and most of them raved to us about how good the food was, so I hope that they return on their own and continue keeping this place in business!  The cost for the reception was VERY reasonable and not inflated by the wedding industry. If it can handle a wedding reception, I would definitely recommend this restaurant for any private event.",

Be sure to read what's in the house salad before ordering! It was great. I appreciate  the attentiveness  of the waiter to be sure that I was okay with it. As it isn't your ordinary house salad. For one thing it comes dressed, with grapes and apples. Which I loved since plain salads are so boring.

As my partner says, it was like being in a SIMS game.   Food: Bruschetta and Tuna Tartare for the appetizer. Full of flavor with every little bite.  My date had filet mignon as I had the rib eye. She describes hers as \"melts in your mouth\" type of ordeal. I tried to savor my rib eye as much as I could, 12oz of medium rare goodness. The portions were really huge, judging off the other tables. We also had a bottle of wine to go with our meals. Ended the night with a Creme Brulee, each. Too good to share.   I will definitely be coming back to Sparklings. Waiters were very prompt and catering. It's not too casual nor too formal of a place to dine and wine.

    "text": "Honestly, I'm very surprised at how disappointing my experience was. We showed up around 6 on a weeknight and the place was pretty empty. Strangely, we weren't greeted by anyone when we came in, and we weren't sure if that meant we were supposed to wait or seat ourselves, so we waited and felt awkward about it. After about a minute and a half, one of the servers came out and noticed us standing there so he refilled someone's water and then showed us to our table.  The service was fine, no real complaints there. We ordered the Grapes, Arugula, and Ricotta Flatbread for the appetizer. For the entrees we ordered the Shrimp Po' Boy and the Chicken Parmigiana. The flatbread had great flavors, but it was seriously unwieldy. I admit that I can, at times, be coordinationally-challenged... but in my defense this was a piece of flatbread that had grapes and candied walnuts sitting on it, with no sharp knife to cut it into pieces. We ended up with a lot of sticky balsamic glaze on our hands, and I personally got a couple of grapes and walnuts in my lap and on the floor. So that was fun.   Her Shrimp Po' Boy sandwich was good. Though in my opinion the small garnish salad on the side was a little measly looking. My Chicken Parmigiana was kind of crazy. The chicken itself was this massive flattened piece of chicken that covered almost the entire plate. I have never seen a piece of chicken like this, I wish I had taken a picture. Anyway, it was breaded and fried, and then set on top of a pile of watery, bland spaghetti. And I mean watery as in, when I tipped the bowl, about a quarter cup of water came forth. That was the water that hadn't already absorbed into the bottom of the chicken breading. It was soggy and strange and disappointing. The flavor of the chicken and breading was good, but I couldn't get over the sog factor. The pasta was unappetizing and I couldn't really eat much of it.   The cocktails were nothing to write home about, especially for the price. I got something with \"fresh\" blueberries in it... and dared to eat one of them. It had no flavor, other than the taste of (possibly) freezer burn.. and the mealy texture that fruit sometimes gets. It was very gross.  The last thing I feel like mentioning just for the sake of being a complainer is that they were playing a collection of popular songs covered by someone on piano/violin. This included Sweet Child O' Mine by Guns N' Roses, and Unforgiven (I think?) by Metallica. Though there were no vocals in the recording, that didn't stop the guy at the table next to us from rocking out with his best Axl Rose impression. It made for an interesting ambiance, but it wasn't quite my cup o' tea.  Bottom line, I won't be back, and I won't be recommending it to anyone. I'm not much of a Yelp reviewer but this place has such amazing ratings I was left feeling confused by my experience and thought I should chime in.",

The bacon & date wrapped meat balls should be renamed \"amaze-balls.\"  Their BBQ ribs are also the most meaty, tender, fall-off-the-bone ribs you will ever have. Way better than you would even get at a place that specializes in ribs.  Honestly, I've never had anything bad here.  The only complaint I have is with the BBQ Pork sliders, and even then not with the sliders themselves. They will allow you to order them as a single sandwich for a couple bucks more, which is great, because the sliders are awesome. However, every time I've ordered them as a single sandwich, it has been served completely differently each time. Once stuffed in an interesting kind of hoagie roll, another time on toast... This time they served it as if it was their grilled chicken sandwich, but with the pork instead of the chicken (meaning it had toppings that simply do not belong with BBQ pork). I'll probably go back to ordering them as sliders due to that inconsistency.",

There was once where we had a poor experience and spoke to the owner Andy. I do want to say that he was apologetic, took the time to listen and addressed our concerns. No establishment is perfect but it is how the owner/manager deals with the issues that count.

We decided to sit at the bar and have some apps, and catch up on some Sportscenter.  What a great find!  We ordered the bacon and date wrapped meatballs, with tomato sauce and OH MY GOODNESS they were awesome!  And the sauce had a little zing to it, full of spice and heat.  Yummo!  We also got the portobello fries, which were perfectly seasoned and cooked and served with two different dipping sauces, one was ranch and the other seemed to be a roasted red pepper sauce.  Both were good and you could tell homemade.  We also split the blackened fish tacos, and again yum!  It was like a lovely little unexpected tapas journey and we are so glad we stumbled on this place.  Next time we are in that neck of the woods, we'll definitely go back.",

    "text": "When you live in Mountain Edge community and you want great nearby restaurant to eat, there are very few choices. One day, I went on Yelp and search for good nearby restaurant to eat, the Sparklings restaurant popped up and here we went.  When I walked in, I met the co-owner who used to manage the Oyshi restaurant located a couple blocks down the road. We went there during peak dinner time on the weekend but the restaurant wasn't crowded, but that could be because the restaurant has only been opened for a few months. There was a lot of people at the bar though.  Anyway, the place was nice and clean and the service was top notch. I looked at the menu and the prices are not cheap, kind of on the mid-tier level. Anyway, we ordered some appetizers and some entrees and here are our takes on it:  All the appetizers we ordered were excellent. The grape flatbread was \"da bomb\" and so was the grilled octopus and the scallops. We wanted to eat more of them after we devoured all in a very short time. As for the entrees, let just say that we were disappointed after starting out so well with the appetizers.  The steak was overcooked and dried, the spicy seafood pasty was kind of bland and under-seasoned and not spicy at all.   Overall, it's decent and close to my house and that's why the 3 stars. I will come back but most likely I will just order the appetizers, especially the flatbread, and not the entrees.",

    "text": "I heard so many great things about this place. The reviews and photos of the food made it \"must try\" in my Yelp bookmarks. The food definitely did not disappoint. The service, on the other hand, was not the best. Having worked in the service industry in the past, I can understand how a short staff can really hurt service, so I was sympathetic to the fact that they were down a few people. When the crowd finally thinned out, however, we were still left wondering when someone would come and bring the check. As the last patrons in the dining area, we were still somewhat over looked. At one point, we observed the staff sitting at a table doing their side work. Not cool. Nobody was rude, they just didn't match service with atmosphere and food quality. That's a shame too because I'd love to tell people to give this place more business. If they are not staffed well enough to take care of their patrons, I can't safely say the trip would be worth it. Unless you're just a foodie without high expectations for service.   As far as the food goes, the tartar was tasty. The flatbread was fulfilling. The scallops were scrumptious. The spaghetti with mushroom and bacon cream sauce was sinfully satisfying. So good, in fact, that one of the people I was dining with, after eating her meal, ordered a plate for herself.   In summary: Go for the AMAZING food, but be prepared for mediocre service.",

The meatball was delicious and the fish cooked just right. The kabobs with the sauteed mushrooms were perfectly cooked and full of great seasonings. Next was a Caesar salad with dressing that tasted like a mix of traditional dressing with a hint of Italian. It was great. I had the Steak Diane which was amazing with mashed potatoes, fried onion strings, green beans and mushrooms. So good it won't soon be forgotten. My husband enjoyed the shrimp and chicken Cajun pasta with the best flavors we've ever tasted. Not too hot but very tasty. If you haven't been here you're missing out!",

I say intimate as its perfect for a romantic date night but it does have a few larger tables and even a separate room for larger parties.  The wait staff is warm, approachable and ready to make recommendations based on what you like and not what the restaurant told them to push.  I had the Jambalaya and for my regular readers you know how much I love properly cooked Cajun food. That being said when I tell you this was the 2nd best Jambalaya I've had since moving to Vegas you know its damn good.  The Fiance had the clam linguine and wasn't impressed. The pasta was cooked perfectly but the sauce itself was bland and the Clams were little itty bitty shriveled up Clams that if served to a customer should have been pulled out of the medium sized shells just to prevent the extra work to remove them or cause you to question why the clam meat had shrunk to that size?  She sent the dish back and refused all the requests to remake the dish or refund the cost of the meal. We didn't say no to the cheese cake they brought over though. It was delicious.  We shared two appetizers, the fries were almost perfection and one of the flat bread dishes, the Fiancee loved that dish and only let me get a little taste.   Highly recommended! Can't wait to go back.",

He was our server and he provided excellent service and an entertaining dining experience, and making us grateful we didn't walk out when we first walked in due to nobody else being in the restaurant (We found out later there was something big happening downtown, and that is why it was as empty as it was). The food was delicious and came out in a timely manner.        We ordered the calamari as an appetizer and believes when we say it was one of the best versions of the dish we've had, and we come a seafood town. I had the Atlantic Salmon, which had a crunchy twist making it a delectable treat. My friend had the shrimp salad, which was a good as a shrimp salad can be lol.      Overall, two thumbs up and another big plus is that it is just far enough away from the strip to make it a perfect Non-Tourist trap.",

Main course filet mignon and chicken parm. Not much to say about the parm. Pretty basic but very good. Filet was melt in your mouth good. Outstanding meal.

Upon entering, you realize that some thought went into the elegant decor.  As you are seated, you begin to wonder if you are an extra on the Great Gatsby set.    As soon as we are seated at our plush, private table in the bar area, the bartender immediately informs us that it is happy hour.  This means beer and wine are 30% off, including bottles.  Seriously, it's Saturday?  We were not expecting happy hour, but total bonus!  We proceed to order many of their delicious appetizers and a couple of bottles of wine for the group.  Some of our favorite apps include the bacon date meatball, crab spinach dip, and the octopus (different from the calamari).  Service was amazing, every employee that we interacted with was fast, friendly, efficient, and knowledgeable    My only gripe is that about 1.5 yr ago we lived across the street from The Sparklings; where were you when we needed you??

The waitstaff was amazing- very friendly and accommodating. I was warned when I ordered the spicy seafood pasta that the heat is about a 6 or 7 out of 10, but they can make a milder version. I'm really happy I was warned in advance- I think the mild version had the perfect amount of spice.  The food was really good- I think there's room for improvement (I wasn't the biggest fan of the calamari in the pasta) however the friendly staff, price point and solid dishes make it worth trying out.  I will definitely be back to try more of the menu (maybe I'll be able to work in a vegetable next time).",

The crispy rice was way too hard so I just ate the scallops. The flavor and preparation was good though. The bruschetta was the best thing I tried although it was not memorable and something I probably won't crave for in the future. Also had the truffle fries and that was good too but nothing special.   My friends had sandwiches which looked better than what I had. They both loved their meals. So maybe I will go back to try other dishes/apps and give an updated review.

I would rate this as a great place to go on a date because of the atmosphere and prices.   The menu is Italian mostly but offers sandwiches, steak and sea food. Most menu items are below $18 and are of a decent portion.   I had a shrimp and chicken pasta my last visit and a plan spaghetti the first time. Both were really tasty, not the best I've had but a good value for the price.   I haven't gone wrong with any of the appetizers especially the steak salad which has perfectly cooled steak along with sweet apples sliced into the mix.   So many people who live in the southwest come here time and time again. Don't expect the flavors of Honeysalt, but you'll have a great meal!",

We ordered a few appetizers and drinks so this review is not for any dinner items.  For a place to go to and have a few drinks and good cheap food, Sparkling's is not the spot.  The appetizers were just okay and nothing to rave about.  They were also quite expensive because appetizers were not discounted during happy hour - just drinks.  However, it definitely seems like it is the spot to take your date to - an intimate and fancy setting.",

Absolute gem of a bartender and always friendly, personable, and even knows our drink orders by heart. Definitely recommend the Pyramid draft beer and the Kenwood Red. All food is great but the Steak salad and zucchini sticks are definitely a good compliment to any drink you get. So take your significant other down here to Sparklings and tell Angel his favorite couple sent you. Well we'll probably even see you here. Yeah it's that serious.",

Our party was huge... 17 people! They were prepared for us and had the table set up with water for everyone before we got there. Super organized! The waiter was also really helpful and took his time with us. It can get pretty hectic with so many people. I was very impressed. They were also even able to split the check for us with no complications. No automatic gratuity included either!   The food was decently priced and amazing. I was expecting to spend a bit more but was very satisfied with their prices. There aren't tooo many options for entrees but they have a lot of appetizers. I decided to make a meal out of the apps cause I couldn't find anything I really wanted from the dinner menu. I got the steak salad and gnocchi. Both were delicious!  I can't wait to come back here!",

It had a nice amount of people there and nothing took too long either. The food was good and the drinks (my daughter turned 21) were good, too. My daughter isn't a drinker so she didn't know what to order and Tim was spot on and was patient about the whole thing. I think it's great!! Only one disappointment was when I asked about other locations that the owner has, they told me only on that side of town, not on the northwest side where I live. :( but maybe and hopefully they will open one by centennial hills. :)",

We waited and waited and waited for the waiter to come back and let us know something about our 3rd persons meal. When he didn't appear, we approached the bar ourselves. He assured us the meal had been ordered and would be out soon. The meal finally shows up, as the rest of the parties empty dishes were being cleared. When requesting other items that should've came with the meal, we waited another 15 minutes. Check out process was another 20 mins.. Probably won't be back.

Every single dish I ordered was delicious: Crispy gnocchi, grilled octopus, sweet potato fries & the flourless chocolate cake. This was already expected since the owner of this restaurant also runs Oyshi & Soyo down the street & I love their food as well. The octopus dish especially surprised me because the meat itself was tender & held a lot of its flavor.

We came for dinner, we had no problem getting in at 7:30 (we didn't have a reservation) and we literally made plans that evening for our night (that's another story).   We see the sign advertising $29 all you can drink at the bar starting after 9:30pm. We decided to give it a shot.   Well, we pay for our wristband and proceed to the bar area. We see two bartenders working. I get the feeling this isn't a good idea, and it's too late now since we bought our wristband.    I wait for nearly 20 minutes for a drink, I ask for two since I know it's going to take forever to get another drink. He wouldn't give me two. My friend comes back with two drinks in her hand. Now I'm irritated on top of annoyed. By 10 pm the place is PACKED. It 3-4 deep at the bar and still only 2 bartenders.   Now I'm no bar manager, but something tells me that if you advertise $29 all you can drink on NYE, you might want to have more than two bartenders on hand.   I ended up getting two drinks the entire night. On my way out, I almost slipped in vomit and spilled drinks on the floor. Classy.   Will I go back? Probably not.",

We like the atmosphere, the decor and the high ceiling which feels nice when you walked into The Sparklings and the service is excellent.   The food over all was good. We ordered bacon & dates meatball. The sauce was sweet and tasty. Grilled octopus was also good but the portion was small. Only 3 pieces on our plate when the price was $7. It's kinda expensive I think. Scallops cooked perfectly but too much butter in the sauce. Not a big fan of their wings...and by the way they were so small. The clam linguine was ok. I think the noddle was too hard, but we still will go there :)",

We were talking in the car on the way home that the Food is AWESOME, the prices are GREAT,  but the Slooooow and RUDE service makes it almost unbearable.  The restaurant was not even full and it was like pulling teeth to get service.  I finally yelled out \"SERVICE\" across the room.  and the rude waitress, Susan, who had been ignoring us all night,  looked my way and flipped her head and walked the other way.  If this place could delivery snappy fast drinks and pleasant service they would have a line out the door and not always be half empty.   Normal wait staff pleasantries were non existent, even from the gal who tried to help our disappearing waitress,  like bringing salt, a glass, a plate, taking away dirty plates, fixing a drink, delivering food and drinks in a timely fashion, making sure everyone got their food at the same time.  We were not expecting anything exceptional in service,  just normal things when you go to a decent restaurant.   It's Sooooo sad and disappointing to see good potential RUINED by staff who could care less about the guest experience.  On the good side, every bite of food I've had there is very good.  Langostina bruschetta, caprese salad,  chicken marsala, ceviche,  gnocchi, scallops and more.  With the groups I've taken there, we have tasted all that and more,  and its all good. The drinks are excellent too, the Voodoo,  the Chandelier.....    BUT slow drinks, rude service, DIRTY bathrooms, HOT dining room,  and people who just don't care will make me think twice about going again.  Please please please fix your problems and hire people who give a shit, and are knowledgeable and pleasant and get rid of that B Susan who is driving your customers away,  so we can come back again. and please,  CLEAN the bathroom,  like REALLY clean it.  Such a beautiful restaurant and such a dank and gross ladies room.  Sad.",

The food is delicious!!! My favorite appetizer is the grapes and arugula flatbread...mmmm!!! The jambalaya is good as well as the cajun chicken and shrimp pasta. The decor is beautiful and it's never crowded no matter what time or day I go, which is a great thing because that means there's never a wait.  I always take my friends here and it's a great place to take a date as well!",

(I don't yelp a lot but this is a place to post about!)  Our first visit we had Jason as our server and he was great! We went around lunch time and there which I didn't mind at all! We tried Zucchini fries, arugula salad, scallops, and the crispy gnocchi our first time & the second time around we got to try pasta and short ribs for our entrees! SO GOOD! Each and everyone of these times! We also had the flourless chocolate cake which is more of a fudge I think. It was good, very rich, but still good! We got full so expect good portions for all of them!  Ambiance is great for like a nice lunch out with girlfriends or a dinner date! Prices are more than reasonable for the quality of their food!  Definitely enjoyed this place a lot and will be coming back again no doubt!",

Had the tortilla soup, the tortilla strips had been in the soup for a while not as a garnish so they were soggy. \"Bacon\" wrapped meatballs with dates, not bacon, its turkey bacon. Fairly priced for everything, unfortunately will not be returning. Very weird atmosphere as well. Disappointed.",

Sweet potatoes fries - cooked just right    Bacon wrapped meatballs - delicious    Sliders - no complaints    Cheese plate - the cheeses were good, but the cranberry and the fried pita were absolutely amazing. The fried pita tasted like fried dough to me! It was delicious with the cranberry and cheese.  Service - Great. Our bartender was friendly and attentive. When I asked if they had blue cheese olives, he said no but he would make some for me since they were not that busy. He also gave us all of our drinks at happy hour pricing even though we arrived there around 4pm.  Atmosphere - Somewhat fancy. Not my style but I wasn't bothered by it at all.  Drinks- Diluted. They use this weird crushed ice at the bar- don't be fooled by it's cool look... it waters down your drink! My martini would have been great, except it tasted watery. (I am picky when it comes to dirty martinis) My husband had some fruity drink and it seemed like he was drinking from a cup full of ice.  Happy Hour - From 5pm to 10pm daily, 30% off all alcoholic beverages. Despite this discount, my martinis were still $10 each, which I felt was high for how diluted down they were. There are no happy hour specials for food, though the food is very reasonably priced and definitely worth the money.",

Once I got there, another friendly staff named Tyler walked me in and took me to a quiet spot so I could do my homework in a more distraction-free area. Not only was I surprised that there was such a thing as a \"private area\" but Tyler immediately impressed me! The hospitality and quick-eagerness of assisting me to what my needs were is truly really amazing. Thank you Anthony and Tyler for being so accommodating.

The flavors were there but it was served with penne pasta and the majority of the sauce sat at the bottom of the plate. The dish was good but I think a linguine noodle would be better.

I have been wanting to check this place out but we never had time, and figured it would be perfect as a send off to our current eating habits. Based off on recommendations I've seen here on yelp, we ordered the crispy gnocchi, seared scallops, and portobello fries. The gnocchi and scallops were pretty good, hubby liked the little rice cake things that came with the scallops. The portobello fries were okay, nothing too special. I think the portobello fries at Echo and rig were better, but that's just me. We were also going to order the tempura and mushroom pasta, but we were both still pretty full from lunch earlier, and the appetizers filled us up, so we had to pass on that. The appetizers were decently sized for the price, which was good. All in all, food were okay but nothing totally struck me as special. We probably should have come here on an empty stomach so we could have tried more of what The Sparkling had to offer. We will give this place another shot (on one of our cheat days ^_^)",

The waitstaff is friendly and attentive and you can tell they want you to keep coming back. Their flour-less chocolate cake is super rich and decadent and tastes GREAT with their espresso. Best dessert ever. The atmosphere is really interesting but difficult to describe. The ornate chandelier in the middle of the room turned us off at first, because we assumed it meant the food would be really expensive. Not so! The appetizers, sandwiches and pasta entrees are very reasonably priced. They do have more expensive steaks and things but I'm sure they're top grade and worth the money. (I haven't had their steak yet.)   It does feel like they haven't quite found their \"niche\" yet (the type of music they play has changed a few times, the atmosphere is really neat but you can't quite tell what theme they're going for etc.), and while the waitstaff is friendly and attentive, they do feel short-staffed a lot of the time. I think as business continues to pick up, they'll hire more people and it will improve the service. All in all, I will keep coming here and I hope more people discover this place and decide they love it.",

We had the truffle fries which were delicious. I had the tartar and a beet/apple salad and my husband had the grilled veggies and a house salad. My beet salad seemed to have 3 slices of apple and a couple bites of beet...while it did not taste BAD, it was underwhelming. The tartar was just fine, but nothing really memorable. the grilled veggies were meh, and still kind of raw tasting and the house salad was essentially just greens with no dressing, we had to ask for more. I would go back but i just think things seemed too pricey for what they are considering the food competition in vegas...",

I had the shrimp tempura and mushroom pasta, which had an over powering lemon taste. I had 2 bites of my pasta and the waiter didn't even notice or say anything about me not touching my food. Then when the check came I still paid full price for my drinks even though it was supposed to be happy hour with 20% off. I will not be returning here and would not recommend The Sparklings.",

    "text": "We came here for a birthday and I was honestly really disappointed with their food and customer service. When we were at the bar it took a solid 15 minutes to get the servers attention for our order. When he finally came over to help they were out of what my BF tried to order and when I went to order they informed me they couldn't make my drink either because they don't make drinks with egg whites (no problem) but he just walked away instead of offering an alternative. When it came to trying to order again after figuring out what they did have that I wanted it took another few minutes to get his attention. We left the bar to a table and when the whole party was ready to order we started with a few appetizers. My BF and his friend ordered the Irish nachos, they were terrible! Imagine stale corn chips with cheese sauce and dry small slices of corned beef. The worst part was that there was barely any cheese sauce to cover the chips. They sat practically untouched until our main course came. The half chicken came with a wing, drumstick and thigh. Hardly a half chicken in my eyes but after digging in that was not the worst part. The chicken was extremely dry and hard to eat because the bones were still in it but it was drenched in a very salty sauce. When it's drenched in sauce and super dry there a problem. I would have sent it back but it took long enough as it was to get our food and it was a big party. I suggest not offering bones in your meals if you're serving it like a typical dish in a bowl drenched in sauce. We won't be back.",

The guy asked to take a picture of my credit card and I refused. I told him when the machine was up and running I'd come pay or they could keep the food.   It was a $29 to go order for what is a nicer restaurant (cheap compared to everything on the menu).   The machine ended up going back up after midnight. He knew I was sick and relentlessly called and texted. I would have just comp'd the meal, not expect a sick person to come back at midnight. I explained to him that I was sick and went and paid the next day. The point is either call me the next day or let it go but don't hammer me with calls and texts at that hour over a $29 meal.   I decided to give them another shot. My boyfriend and I went for dinner. We are late sleepers and this place is open until 2. Walked in at 1:12 and the guy said the kitchen is closed. I said so early? He said the kitchen closes half an hour before closing. I said it's 45 min and asked if we could order to go. He said they were slow and closed the kitchen early. Then why tell me the half hour rule?  Fix your credit card machines and learn to tell time. Please and thank you",

I loved that the decor was elegant and the menu was affordable. This allowed me to try more items on the menu.  I started with the French Onion Soup which was amazing! The broth , the bread and the gooey cheese made the best French Onion soup I've had to date. I was also curious about grape, basil and ricotta flat bread so I definitely had to order that! It was also topped with candied walnuts, arugula (my favorite)  and drizzled with balsamic. It had that sweet and savory taste to it. I folded mine and ate it like a sandwich so nothing would fall off to the side. It's a great appetizer because it's light and leaves room for your entree. Since I just had my wisdom teeth taken out I needed a very soft entree. I chose the Rice Au Gratin with chicken. It was creamy, rich and fit the bill . The portions were big enough for me to take some home for lunch the next day.   The Sparklings is a wonderful place for a date and special occasions.The dishes are great for sharing so everyone can order something different and you can experience an array of entree's and appetizers.",

    "text": "1-10-15 - After having a pleasant late afternoon experience with Anthony at the bar, I decided to give it a try at 9:30 on a Saturday night.  The dining room was sparsely populated but the bar was a bit more active.  This is the kind of place you REALLY want to like.  It's beautiful. Great ambiance with the soft jazz music, lively but not loud but this is also the kind of place you expect to see on Gordon Ramsey's show with him yelling at the owners!  The problem... The Sparkings needs to decide what it wants to be and go at it whole hearted!  Why spend the money making something look nice and unique and then have mediocre to bad food?  Tonight i had the scallops. Perfectly cooked again although room temp.  I didn't mind but wished they were hotter.  I also had the truffle fries... truly THE WORST FRIES I have ever had in my life.  They were super dry like freezer burn and thank God the bartender suggested I get all the toppings on the side because they were disgusting.  The normal topping would have been the powdered, green can kind of parmasean, mayo with truffle oil and garlic (all garlic), ranch dressing and ketchup.  Nothing sent together and with bad fries at the base, it was just horrible.  My dining partner had chinese chicken salad, picked at it and said it was really bad.  I was going to order the cheesecake which I know is good (but it is not made on site) but at 11:30Pm they went from Jazz to Techno and that was it for me... and all the other people in the bar except for the six seemingly young gay men in the corner.  They are open until 3am so I asked about that. I was told a lot of service workers stop in to have \"great food\" and relax after work.  I'm not really sure what \"service workers\" want after a day of hard work but I'm pretty sure this is not it.  Oh yes... there was still a large table in the dining room at the same time there was a yellow mop bucket on wheels and a mop.  I got a shot of that. Gordon Ramsey... where are you??? Help this place live up to it's potential!  If it's in business in 3 months I will be a surprise.  If you go, make sure you sit at the bar and ask for Anthony... he's the only real asset.  Owners... take yelp reviews seriously.  It's free advice and you don't have to hire a consultant to figure it out.  Cut your menu in half.  Use fresh ingredients.  have a few signature things.  Raise the prices if you half to.  Just do a few good things right and the crowds will follow.  BTW, a bucket and mop in the dining area during service?  Yuck.",

The soup was SOOOO flavorful and rich. The Rainbow Trout tasted so fresh and bright, and the portion size was just right. Our server, I believe, was the bar tender since it was so late. He was super friendly and chatty and made sure not to forget about us in the dining room. We've heard so many great things about this place and they are all definitely True.

    "text": "This was the worst experience possible, from the slow service and attitude from our server to the bus boy spilling crushed pepper all over my lap and my salad (it wasn't his fault but might want to get a new pepper holder.) First things first, I was meeting 3 of my friends and her newborn baby there, yes they were a little bit late but I let the guy know I needed a table for 4 he said no problem so instead of seating me prior to my friends getting there like most places would do he made me wait til they got there and then as soon as they got there we waited another 10 minutes to finally be seated. It was around 1:40 last Sunday March 3rd. Our waiter was the absolute rudest thing and strutted around the restaurant like he was the owner (I would certainly hope not) or some royalty of some sort. He was very dry and kept calling us \"babe\" or \"baby\" sorry but I'm not your girlfriend and you shouldn't be addressing customers that way. I was so upset at how slow it was taking them to bring my friend sugar, SUGAR nothing special just SUGAR, her coffee started to get cold and finally the busser advised he would bring some over along with a new coffee for my friend. I literally didn't want to be there anymore after waiting 30 minutes for the waiter to come back and take our older. I ordered the cheapest simplest thing on the menu (mind you we were going to go all out on brunch but not after that experience). Finally after another 30 minutes my Caesar salad made with Tysons brand striped chicken strips you can get in the meat dept arrived. The busser brought over the pepper shaker only for the whole pepper to fall completely all over my lap and salad. I was so ready to leave. The bathroom was disgusting, toilet paper on the floor, water splashed over the sink. I had to track down our \"waiter\" to get our check, he was up front just gossiping with the girl up there. I was really looking forward to coming to this place after hearing praise about it but not after my experience. I don't care if you guys had a party the night before and had people working the next morning, the manager should know how to schedule to ensure everyone has a nights rest to prepare for work the next day.

    "text": "The Sparklings reportedly gets its name from the immense atmospheric chandelier prominently on display in the center of the restaurant, but it might as well describe the incredible flavor and value of just about everything on their menu . Such an extensive menu at that too, from the specials like rainbow trout served as a light portion to the steak entree and everywhere in between, the menu is nicely priced and high quality. This \"barstaurant\" is open until the wee hours of the morning and serves familiar fine dining food at comfort food prices.  The atmosphere is old-school, country-club, Rat Pack ( Frank Sinatra Sr., Sammy Davis Jr. and friends ) meets the movie \"Cocktail' ( with a young Tom Cruise, Elizabeth Shue, and Bryan Brown ) meets the television serial comedy \"Cheers\". The bar area is integral to the experience but subtly segregated from the dining room providing a different environment from the dining room. If you and your crew need an intimate setting to unwind, the bar is the place. If you are a couple on a date ( with or without toddlers in tow ) the dining room might be more to your liking. This is a discrete environment where the jet-set aren't bothered by paparazzi and the young neighborhood folks acknowledge each other politely.  Obviously a neighborhood, locals kind of place where \"everybody knows your name\", the employees working in this beautiful example of New Vegas culture demonstrate the pronounced culture of treating every guest like the Brown Derby and everybody is a movie star!   I recommend the cheese platter, aforementioned Rainbow Trout (if available, Pan-Seared Salmon if not), Ribeye, Spaghetti with Meat Sauce, French Onion soup, Lobster Bisque, Caesar Salad, and many more Food Network worthy New American cuisine treats. From the bar, I recommend Angel's Gin and Tonic with extra lime.",

Its far from me (summerlin) but my friend suggested it for brunch and bottomless mimosas starting Friday-- which I LOVE WITH ALL MY HEART. the place looks great. Very chic and clean. Wait staff is great, the food was tastey and portions were perfect. Very good for groups of people wanting to have conversations. We stayed here for more than 2 hours, and they were fine with us hanging out there. I would definitely come back, they had me at BOTTOMLESS.",

We ordered the Truffle Parmesan Garlic Fries (3/5). I have had better truffle parm garlic fries and there was nothing too special about these ones. The lemon dipping sauce was yummy though.   My hubby ordered the Spaghetti Aglio E Olio (3/5). I give it a 3 only because it was something different for me and I just wasn't used to only having olive oil and garlic on my spaghetti. I like my pastas with a lot of saucy tomato-y or creamy flavor. But I would give it a try again.   I ordered the Clam Linguine (4/5). I liked how they used real clams and not canned clams, it tastes so much better of course. The white wine sauce was really yummy and they gave a portion that was just right.   Overall I think this place is really cute especially for big groups. The prices are reasonable and the service was good. Definitely coming back here again.",

Very delicious and fresh! Despite it being Happy Hour we were escorted to a nice Vip-looking table that had curtains for privacy-- not bad since it was only in the afternoon!! Our bartender/waiter was very accommodating and he looks like a taller, cleanly shaven version of Iron Man lol! Also, it was a nice touch when their chef personally served our main dishes and told me good luck on eating my steak thinking I couldn't finish it... But I did! Overall, the barstaurant gave off a fancy schmancy dining experience but for an affordable price.",

I was super surprised that they weren't busier... There were really only a few other tables with people at them. 2) They were great about menu modifications (keto life y'all). 3) Their cocktail menu is LEGIT and they do a bottomless mimosa as well! Their Bloody Mary is fantastic! 4) Their menu had SO many great brekkie options - indulgent and healthy alike! Short rib Benny - highly recommend! Everyone loved their food.  The only thing that needs a little work was the drink service took quite a bit longer than expected, but our server was super sweet and that made up for it.  The location is a little weird but it's a GREAT place for a group brunch! The ambience is what you make it - it's a beautiful space with a clean look, if I lived closer, I'd be there more often.",

    "text": "I stopped in here to meet a friend for dinner and drinks on Wednesday. Upon entering there was a sign that read, please wait to be seated yet there was not a host/hostess present. I waited for about five minutes before sitting down at the entrance. At that point I decided to wait for my friend before being seated. About five more minutes passed and still no host/hostess. Other people entered one for a carry out and another to dine in. One of the waiters came over and began taking care of them. At that point I figured I should be seated while he was available as my friend still had not arrived.   Once seated the waiter was attentive but you could tell he was hurried. There were about five full tables and the bar was pretty full. The decor is nice, but confusing. There's a modern layout and most of the furniture is modern as well. However; there are some pieces the many many cabinets that are traditional and seem out of place. The structure of the menu is very different as well. Each page has appetizers listed at the top and I can't understand the logic behind it but it took us forever to figure which ones to order as they were not all on one page.   Now onto the food---but first my wine order. My first glass arrived with about 4oz. It was corrected but I was surprised at the short pour. Also-my friend wanted to taste a liquor before ordering and that was not allowed. The FOOD, finally! We ordered the caprese salad and that was not good. The tomato was bad and there was not enough balsamic. It lacked flavor. Next was the seafood ravioli and as you can see they were burnt on one side. I'm not sure how that happens but it made it hard to eat. In addition the vodka sauce was sweet-ugh. We also tried the meatballs (see picture) and they were AWFUL to say the least. The were dry and tasted as if they were kept warm all day. It was disappointing because my friend was excited to try those. We also tried the spinach and crab dip-oh my! The spinach was welted in an oil, there was not any cream and there was not any crab but the cheese that was used was good. It was the first appetizer to come out and it was very small so we ate that with little complaint as we were starving. However; I should have said something. I've never had a dip that didn't have some creaminess to it. It was just welted spinach with cheese backed on top-that's it!!  Last but not least-we we're still hungry as we didn't finish anything but the dip but we were terrified to order anything else. After talking to our waiter we decided in the dessert trio. The thumbprint sized flourless cake and ice cream was good. The creme brulee tasted like yolk, as if it wasn't fully mixed.   There you have it-disappointed to say the least as it was our first time there and were looking for a GOOD place to frequent. I'm not sure if we'll return, but you should definitely give it a try for yourself.",

Unfortunately it doesn't applies to any it's the food listed on the menu :( The bar tender was jovial and very nice. Every single items we picks from the menu was excellent! We ordered some caprese, shrimp ceviche, artichoke dip and some sea scallops LOVED IT Next I noticed, the restaurant was full of people! The room is spacious and great for large group.

We recently (Aug 10, 2019) threw a surprise birthday dinner there and the staff went above and beyond to accommodate our large party of 16.  I ordered the \"creamy\" crispy pesto gnocchi with Italian sausage, peas and crushed candied walnuts.  It was an appetizer portion but was very fulfilling.  Cost $7.5 USD.  I washed it down with a glass of picante margarita (Gran Centenario Silver Tequila, sweet & sour, orange juice, Serrano pepper).  I wanted to try the other food but I was so anxious from the surprise, hoping it would go as planned, that I lost my appetite during the process.    Keep up the good work STAFF of The Sparlkings. I hope to come back soon.",

    "text": "The Sparklings is far away from where I live, but if you have a big group of people looking for lots of enjoyable options to eat, this is an wonderful choice for you...especially since their service has been excellent on all of my visits.     My most recent visit was just for a party of four. The seating is always spacious and ample. Often you are able to point to which table you prefer...not because they are necessarily dead, but because the space is so large. The Sparklings is not just about options of seating however. The space is well-decorated in a modern, eclectic style.   Definitely a crowd favorite, the \"Crispy Gnocchi\" in pesto sauce is more than worth a try...so while you are indecisively thinking about what to order for an entree, just go ahead and order the Crispy Gnocchi as an appetizer...you will thank me. On the last couple of visits, I've enjoyed the Pan-Seared Salmon and Spicy Seafood Pasta. I love these dishes and all my dining companions have also been very satisfied with theirs meals as well. Additionally, there is a full bar for you to enjoy a cocktail or a glass of wine.   One of my only real gripes with The Spaklings is the room temperature. It seems like every time I've been here the dinning room has either been too cold or too hot, but never comfortable. Still, make a point to come here and let me know what you think of it.  -2018 review #17-",

Today, I was meeting friends that live in Henderson and wanted to pick a place that was somewhat in the middle. I chose sparklings because of its yelp reviews but unfortunately, was disappointed.   It took a while to get our mimosas after we were sat down, and the food was super mediocre. A couple of us got the steak and eggs and found the steak to be chewy with the fat not rendered.   I may be back, but i definitely hope it's better next time.",

On first impressions: The space is cute but a bit hodgepodge in decor, it also feels a little too dark, I don't know if they keep the lights dimmed for ambiance but I was not feeling it. Then the menu, I didn't really know what to expect, but just like the decor I felt it was a little all over the place, from spaghetti to elote to jambalaya and salmon. It made deciding what to eat strangely hard. The servers were pretty nice, some a bit over enthusiastic and others underwhelmed, but still helpful and tasteful. I was happy with the price point and the portion size of the spaghetti I wound up getting but I don't know, I just felt it to be average when I was looking for a wow.",

    "text": "A couple friends reccommended The Sparklings, they said they come here very often. Since we heard great things, we decided to come to The Sparklings for an early Sunday dinner. We arrived around 5:30pm, and the restaurant was very quiet. We were the only people seated, minus someone in the bar area. However, that quickly changed as more and more people filled the restaurant creating a nice ambiance. The chandelier in the middle creates such a nice and romantic experience. They have very large tables inside and outside, perfect for showers and events! The service was great, our waiter checked on our table every so often and made sure we were all taken care of.   The dishes were fantastic! We tried two different types of gnocchi as an appetizer, red meat gnocchi and brown butter gnocchi. I personally liked the brown butter one because the gnocchi was crispier, but the red meat sauce added such a great flavor to the gnocchi. I would recommend getting both to try, as they are not large dishes. For my entree, I got Spaghetti Aglio e Olio, simple, but SO delicious. I typically eat slow, but I think I was the first one done! My dish also came with a side of buttered bread.  I am so happy The Sparklings was recommended to me, and I cannot wait to try it again!",

I work down the street on rainbow and often go there for happy hour after work been there also several occasions for dinner and a private event.  Like I said, beautiful restaurant, friendly staff but I don't think there is one thing on the menu that is remarkable. Everything is just kind of blah, for some reason I keep getting ceviche, and it is just NOT good, its just ok, same with calamari, octopus, flatbreads, pretty much everything. Same with the cocktails, ordered a french 75 and it was just undrinkable, aperol spritz was ok - I just stick to wine for now on.  I will probably still go back because is near work and again, is cute and not terrible, I wish they will fix their menu!",

Despite the fancy interior, the menu is fairly priced. No $70 steaks here! The inside is spacious with various tables/sections good for larger groups or for even just two.    I ordered the mushroom bacon pasta, and it was plated nicely. Serving size was decent and the taste was above my expectations for a simple dish. I believe it was around $10-12 whereas I've seen other restaurants charge $20+ for something similar to this.  Tip: If drinking late on weekdays is your thing I noticed the bar area was pretty packed considering it was 10pm on a Tuesday.   Overall nice restaurant on the SW side of town. I'll be back to try brunch!",

The waiter served us asap with water and explained the menu a little bit as it was my first time there. There is a TON of options, a little over whelming but in a good way. The atmosphere was super cute and trendy. Not busy at all but I enjoyed it that way as I was able to hear conversations. The seating section was a bit odd, but seemed very useful for large parties. Will for sure come here with a big group or any birthday party, events.  The food was delicious! I got a mushroom pasta and fries. All very reasonably priced.",

I too experienced the poor cutomer service when I waited about 30min prior to my friend asking the waitress for a water for me. Another 10-15min pass and another friend asked a waitor for a menu. Thank God my friends have customer service skills. The food was decent for the price. I ordered a salad and it was quite tasty. Their truffle fries were nothing special. I was thankful they were able to split the checks. It is unfortunate when an establishment has so much potential. However, I do not plan on returning. If you're looking for a new hipster joint and like being ignored this is the spot for you.",

The detail, the style, all lend to a fancy, yet casual, bordering on hipster-esque, night out on Rainbow Blvd.   I wanted to steal all of their furniture.    Other positives include really friendly, but not creepy friendly, waitstaff.  Our food came out almost immediately and water was always timely refilled.  Okay, so, the food...  We ordered the following: diver scallops (appetizer), butternut squash gnocchi (appetizer), tuna tartare (appetizer); and fries.  The diver scallops were perfectly cooked but....there were only 3....and they were small (the rest were fried rice cakes).  The tuna tartare was also delicious but included only a small portion.  But, good execution all around.  The only things I didn't really enjoy were the butternut squash gnocchi and the fries.  You'd expect a sweetness in the butternut squash gnocchi but unfortunately the squash tasted unripe, making the dish a little bland.  The fries also, sadly, tasted a bit uncooked/raw (and cold).  I'm not sure how you mess up fries, but, those suckers needed way more time in the fryer.  Overall, I'd return because I had a great experience.  Some of the food, yes, was a little off, but I have a feeling it will improve.  3.5 Stars.",

The service was excellent. We got everything we needed without missing a beat. This was impressive with 3 toddlers in the group.   Aside from a lovely room and great service, the food delightful and quite a value! Hubby and I shared clam chowder, scallops with crispy rice cakes and lemon buerre blanc, linguini and clams, and crispy gnocchi. We also got a side of fries and a beer. All for under $50! The gnocchi was creamy and delicious. A healthy portion for the $9 price. The scallops were good but nothing special. The sauce lacked the citrusy zing I was hoping for. Chowder was good with light airy crispy bread to dip. Linguini and clams was a winner. Flavorful and al dente. There was so much more I wanted to try! We will definitely go back.   This would be a great place to entertain guests. Impressive and affordable.",

My daughter ordered kids meal chicken fingers with fries and the chicken was tough & dry. She didn't even finished both of the chicken. I ordered Philly cheese sandwich which barely any meat inside & just too thick of bread. My son ordered 4 sliders that cost us $15. My husband said with his meal was OK but nothing special about it. Although the service was alright.  Paid too much money for unsatisfied meal.",

The food was delicious as well.  Will definitely return.",

    "text": "I really liked the inside of the sparklings, its very comfortable and the staff were pleasant and clean. Parking wasnt too bad, and I also like the way they keep their bar area separate from the restaurant, its interesting. There is a separate lounge room for bar drinks and socializing but its kept apart from the restaurant dining room and can still be viewed via indoor window, i thought this was pretty smart since it keeps the dining areas ambiance more quiet and relaxing if you dont want the loud fuss of the people around the bar scene bothering you. Once you enter the center of the restaurant has a flower arrangement of orchids with seating protruding from this center and a large chandelier hanging from above. Decor has almost a modern mixed with antique feel to it. We ordered the crispy gnocchi, scallops, french onion soup, hamburger steak, and seared salmon. The scallops were good and I liked the sauce on them, the gnocchi was also good and had a pesto cream sauce and the gnocchi itself were lighty crisp out and soft inside. The french onion soup was good but a little on the salty side and the salmon was a little garlicky and also very salty but the flavor was good. Besides them needing to drastically reduce the sodium in their food I couldnt complain too much. The hamburger steak comes on a bed of rice loco moco style but has good flavor as well. Overall i thought this place was okay, but they need to really cut down on the salt before my blood pressure kills me. Be sure to get an extra glass of water to dilute your food if you decide to stop here.",

Everytime I hear this name it sounds like I'm going to a Barbie and Ken esque couples house and really, the decor is the right amount of homey chic that I would like to believe it so.   Despite me being too full to try the amazing looking food, the comments from friends were more than positive. It was happy hour which had drink and food specials from 10pm to close (2am - ish). Our server/bartender, Jose, was also such a personality and was absolutely a sweetheart.   I wish this was in the NW close to me instead as it's a beautiful spot to hang out late night, and a lovely place to eat during day. It looks like a typical neighborhood lodge bar from the outside, but it totally isn't and doesn't serve plain ole' bar food.   I will be back very soon, for a full dinner. But for late night, this place is a absolutely great spot.",

There's a cool huge crystal chandelier in the dining area and several small, fun touches - like the hot pink door leading to the kitchen The servers are friendly and prompt (although I did have to ask for a water refill - which, in my opinion, should be automatic).  The men's bathroom is in desperate need of a deep cleaning though. There's thick hard water deposits on the fixtures and dirt stains on the mirrors and towel dispenser. While the main dining area looks very well maintained, the men's restroom appears utterly neglected.  Wife said women's room looked good.  Thought it discomfiting that the server did his side work in the main dining area during lunch. There was lots of silverware clanging around while we were trying to eat.  The price was good, the food: excellent!  Will most likely return at a happy hour in the future.  Just hope they clean the men's room.  If not for the few things I dislike I would have given 4 stars.",

The Sparklings is opened by the same people who opened Oyshi down the street. The inside is to me very \"hipster\" but I love the set up. They have a bar to the right that is sectioned off with a window. There are a cluster of tables in the center and long booth seating with tables along the wall and on the left there are sectioned off semi private dining rooms.   Everytime I've been here I've had the same server, Jason, and he is awesome. He really knows the menu and will joke around with his customers. Charismatic.   We've tried several things on the menu but it seems like everyime we come here we are starving and I never remember to take pictures.   My personal favorite dish is the Shrimp Linguini and the Creme Brulee. I'll have to update this review later with pictures.  All in all, wonderful place with great atmosphere and service. The food is good and priced well. Definitely need to try!",

    "text": "Don't judge a book by it's cover...open the book!  South Las Vegas is growing and one by one new things appear.  Just recently Sparklings opened!  American/Asian influenced.  My husband and I walked in on a beautiful Thursday afternoon and to our surprise we were the only patrons there.  First impression is French Provincial!!! Velvet chairs, Glamorous Chandelier, many hutches of early american design with antique place wear.  They have 3 different pastel colored rooms for up to 10 seating in each off to the side of the main room, a room for private parties 12 or more you can close off to make it more personal and an open area with solid marble tables and Velvet seats and Benches for comfortable seating.  In another section there is a small bar and a door to outside seating if preferred.   The menu has very comfortable pricing for the dishes they serve, The wait staff is pleasant and warm, the owner even walked over to introduce himself and give kudos to their chef.  By the looks of this place and the quality that goes into their dishes I would think it's more an upscale restaurant, but as we left a man in torn jeans and baseball cap and a girl with shredded shorts and tank top came walking in and were seated and treated as if they were dressed accordingly...so I guess it doesn't have to be an elegant night out.  Every bite of every dish we ordered was excellent...even the teriyaki Octopus which was out of this world! The Salmon in lemon sauce and capers was fabulous as was the Cajun Shrimp Pasta!  Next time I'll make room for the chocolate flourless cake or Creme Brulee.  We will definitely go again and again!! Did I mention that we got excellent service from our waiter???  Best we've had in a long long time!!! It;s nice to have a restaurant like this here in our area without having to drive to Greenvalley or Summerlin for the high end experience.",

Great chandelier in the center and cool velvet seating.  The service was slow. Seemed to be one waiter handling  the whole restaurant the entire time we were there.  We ordered rib kabobs and the Irish nachos as an appetizer. The nachos left much to be desired but the kabobs  were delicious. It took awhile  to get our appetizers out but the main dishes came out in good timing afterwards.  Our table ordered tempura shrimp and mushroom pasta, steak Diane and the chicken pasta with creamy bacon sauce.  The pasta  was cooked beautifully, you can tell it was freshly made as it was thick and dense.  The sauce was flavorful  and the veggies fresh.  The steak medallions  were tender and the sauce was very flavorful.   After dinner, my wife visited the ladies room and she said the bathrooms were filthy.  Water all over the counters, soap dripped all over the sink and floor, paper  towels on the ground... obviously those bathrooms had not been tidied up all day.  Despite the bathrooms and somewhat slow service, the food was great and we definitely will return.",

The owner has paid attention to interiors but if it is supposed to be depict fine dining, bar and lounge then they need to do something more than just hanging the chandelier from the top. It is not a nice view when you look up because I have never been to a fine dining and lounge space that has undone ceiling. Looks very cheap.  Service was good. Food could have been better. Their raspberry ginger mojito was very good. Their pan seared scallops which they claim is one of their signature dishes was overcooked. The presentation although was very good. Their zucchini fries were average with no salt.  Their spicy seafood pasta which again they claim is one of their signature dishes was average. Pasta was overcooked.  They had some mussels and tiny shrimps for the sake of calling it seafood pasta. Restaurants like this should not cut corners in preparing food like this. We didn' t like their cheap cheese grater. I have better ones at home. Their creme brulee was a disaster. Looks like the chef made no efforts to serve it fresh. It had an overdose of vanilla essence. The caramelized sugar coating was cold, thick and extremely sweet. The caramelization part is supposed to be done just before serving.  Little did we know they serve it pre made. Very disappointing.   We have been to some of the best food places all over the country. So when it comes to restaurants we pay attention to many details. The place failed to sparkle for us last night.",

Went with the gf and just ordered a few appetizers, the crispy gnocchi (super delish), the bacon wrapped meatball with dates (my personal favourite), seared crispy scallops (your missing out if you don't order), and the bruschetta with a cream cheese avocado topping. You really can't go wrong with any of those!  The service was perfect, everything came out at a nice steady pace, the waiter was very friendly and the manager was welcoming, making sure everything was good and to satisfaction (A rare trait in todays restaurant world).

Sometimes I want to get food after a long day of work but have to get it elsewhere because they don't have an online menu where I can order and pick up to take home.  Btw, I miss the short rib they used to have.  Gnocchi is killer though",

We ordered a bunch of appetizers and they all were great, the grilled wings were exceptionally delicious, the bacon wrapped date stuffed meatballs were perfect, our friend's father said his philly cheese steak was the best he'd ever had (and he's always on the hunt). We went back for lunch today and it was amazing, we sat on the patio, which was beautiful, and we ordered the wings again (our 3yr old loved them), the portobello fries, meatballs, calamari salad (delicious!) And this awesome turkey, brie, cranberry sandwich that was to die for! Not one thing has disappointed us and the service today was on point. This is my new favorite place to hang and eat! I believe they are kid friendly until late night. They had boosters and highchairs. Their beer and cocktail list is decent as well. Check this place out, it won't disappoint!",

    "text": "The Sparklings deserves zero stars.  To start we waited several minutes for someone to greet us at the front door, it was no where near busy, so there is absolutely no excuse for the lack of customer service.  Finally we were sat by a man who also ended up being our server and he turned out to be a complete ditz. He was clueless when it came to the menu, took forever to bring out drinks and to get refills, and suggested items on the menu to be better then others but couldn't offer reasons as to why. During the dinner 2 other men approached our table, one of which was a gentlemen who changed his accent 3 times, and another who offered to bring back a refill and took it up to the front host stand where it sat while he did other duties for other tables. These 3 men seemed to be the only employees in the restaurant and makes you wonder if they were also the cooks lol.  When it came to the food, it was absolutely horrific. Nothing on the menu made sense, it was all cold when it got to the table, pasta dish was hard and tasted terrible, not to mention the pasta was clumping together because there was lack of oil and garlic, the lasagna tasted like Stauffers, the gnocchi dish was smaller then an appetizer, there was 12 gnocchi in a dish with hard squash and no sauce and it said it was supposed to have brown sugar butter which there was none. The ravioli was cold and topped with diced tomatoes, not a great combo.  The decor was hodgepodge and the music selection was so random, at one point you thought you were fine dining and the next you were bumping to EDM.   The whole experience was pitiful and the only good thing that came out of it was how hard my family laughed at how much of a joke it",

    "text": "Dusting off and old bookmark. Time to Sparkle  The saying, \"never judge a book by its cover\" has never been Truer when it comes to The Sparkling. The outside has the look of every other terrible twenty-four hour local gambling hall. The PT's, the Dotty's, and the Distills of the Valley, but once you walk-in it's completely different.   A giant chandelier is hanging in center of the main room with brown vintage booths directly underneath. This seating is then surrounded by freestanding tables and private booth areas, I would say the style and vibe of the place is Southern, but the food is a mix of American/Italian?   We sat in the center booth and promptly ordered drinks and apps. Moscow mules all around and for the apps we got Bacon & Date Wrapped Meatball and Crispy Gnocchi. These were both very good, the Crispy Gnocchi had incredible flavor and the pesto sauce was drinkable. The Gnocchi itself was perfectly cooked, but wasn't crispy. I'm not sure how that factors in in the description. OK, Bacon & Date Wrapped Meatballs. Stay with me here... You take a date, then you stuff it with delicious spicy meats, and then wrap it in bacon. Nuff said. The mules were overly sweet and didn't seem to have much ginger, but they were still tasty and refreshing.   The main course - The only Italian thing about this plate was the word \"pasta\" in the title... Cajun Chicken and Shrimp Pasta. Normally, I stay away from this type of Chili's or Applebee's style of food, but I wasn't really feeling much else on the menu, plus the server swore by it. Thank you server guy. This plate of food was delicious, the sauce was spicy, and the pasta was cooked perfect. The chicken and shrimp complimented each other nicely. They seasoned the proteins prior to adding them to the sauce, great touch.   The server we had was stellar, so good in fact that we didn't want to leave after dining and ended up sipping a few drinks. We moved to the bar so we didn't keep a table busy. The bar was pretty empty, but the service very slow. Bummer.   The ambiance and food were great; I would definitely come back here in the future. If I could a 4.5 star rating, I would.",

UHHHHH LOL thanks for getting another dish but what if he got sick? NORMALLY when something like that happens for HEALTH reasons they try to do something to accommodate you but that was not the case here. I've never been so disgusted, just like everyone who gives bad reviews for cockroaches in their food, this is one of those reviews. Will never be coming back here, gave it 2 stars for the decor inside the restaurant.",

And happy hour goes on until 10! The drink I ordered was called \"Pretty in Pink\" and it was delicious and of course in True happy hour fashion I ordered two at the same time but this was before I knew happy hour was until 10pm. The restaurant was not packed at all which was great because I was hosting a \"Welcome to Motherhood\" dinner for my best friend so it kept it pretty intimate even with our seating being out in the open. I took one star off though because 2 things that we wanted to order and had been hoping to try were not on the available which sucked because we had visitors from California hoping to try this. Also, it was hard to get hold of our waitress because she was catering to another table of 20 but we told her we would have patience with her because she let us know a head of time. She was a good waitress just busy. Other than that the experience was great, the food was great, the appetizers were beyond fabulous (especially the truffle fries and the fried zucchini) and the desserts (specifically the creme brulee) was perfect. I recommend that if you want to host a small intimate get together (baby shower, bridal shower, birthday dinner) then you consider this place. They even let us put up our own decorations.",

    "text": "I had been wanting to try this place since moving into the area about 6 months ago. Today was the day I finally got to check out the Sparklings.   Located near the southwest corner of  Windmill(Shelbourne, actually) and Rainbow, you will find the Sparklings in the same area as Pho Annie and Cheeburger Cheeburger.  - I ordered a Ribeye steak, cooked medium rare with sides of fried veggies and mashed potatoes ($25). The portion size of the steak was healthy and it was cooked very well. My only complaint was there was quite a bit of fat on there. Also the portion size of the mashed potatoes was pretty puny. They tasted good, but I only had a few spoonfuls and then they were gone! - We split an order of wings as an appetizer($8). They were ok. They were covered in a sweet sauce (teriyaki?) and very tender.  - The ribs portion was also fairly substantial and the meat was fall-off-the-bone tender. The taste of the meat just wasn't doing it for me. I felt like I was eating a pot roast. It wasn't bad at all, just not what I was expecting. - Service was good. Drinks were refilled promptly and the waiter was friendly and engaging.  The room is beautifully decorated, including that impressive chandelier. Lots of open air and space to accommodate many people. I didn't get a chance to check it out, but the bar area actually looked very cozy and inviting. Maybe one of these days we'll all swing by here for drinks.  As for the food, it was okay, but honestly lacked the \"wow\" factor that will have me returning any time soon. Maybe one of these days I'll give it another shot, but for now the 3 star rating feels very appropriate. Its A-Ok..  3 stars.",

    "text": "Really disappointing experience at this restaurant. I visited recently with a group of my girlfriends for brunch, and we were a large group of 20 girls. As soon as I walked into the restaurant I was super excited, the ambiance was fantastic and the menu looked amazing. However I was quickly disappointed by the service and the lack of cleanliness of the bathrooms.   We started our really good and quickly got water, but I soon found myself out of water and stealing other waters from empty seats. I went through three water glasses and not once did anyone refill or even offer to refer my glass. We had pitchers on our tables but they quickly ran out of water too.   On top of that, it took them an hour to get my food either because the waitress forgot to put in the order or the chef forgot to make it, I'm not sure which one it was. I ordered chicken and waffles and a pineapple juice as soon as I sat down, and with the rest of the group as they ordered, and it wasn't until the rest of my group had had their food and basically finished it that the waitress asked me what I ordered. I never got my pineapple juice but I did get my chicken and waffles. I had to get it to go because I was on a time crunch, and the waitress was nice enough to comp it, but it really didn't make up for it.   On top of that the bathrooms were disgusting. Water and liquids everywhere, soggy paper towels on the ground and rags sitting around in the stalls and on the sink. I started gagging as soon as I walked in and I held my breath the entire time I was in there. I honestly could not believe how horrible it was, especially for a restaurant that is more upscale than most.   Overall it was a horrible experience. I will not be back and I will not recommend this spot for any future brunches going forward. Avoid at all costs!",

I was craving wings, so I ordered their Grilled Ginger Soy wings, in addition to the fried calamari, bacon wrapped meatballs, zucchini sticks, and steak salad my friends ordered.   When you order a variety of items, there is bound to be some hit and misses, as I experience here. For example, the ginger soy wings tasted quite good, but I could not get over the fact how tiny them wings were. I had to struggle to find chewable meat on them bones. I am not kidding, I worked those bones substance, but good thing the flavor was there.   The fried calamari was good. It was lightly fried and breaded. The calamari inside was tender and sweet as it should be. Well done. The bacon wrapped meatballs were okay. I liked the marinara they came in because it had a good balance between acidity and sweetness, but the meatball itself was to, how would I put it, mushy I guess. It needed texture and density. The flavor was good, and so was the bacon it came wrapped in but, it was almost as if it had to much moisture in it.   The fried zucchini stick were pretty good, although they did exhibit a water inside of them, which leads me to believe they \"may\" have been previously frozen. They tasted good and had a nice crunch, but I could literally squeeze them and watch the water drain from them.   Service was very good and quite attentive. This place no doubt has potential, and perhaps it's already there, but I would refine some of the items I had on this visit. More importantly, some plumper wings would be much appreciated.",

I will never return nor will the 20 guest we had for the bridal Shower we hosted there. The manager left his staff short staffed. Service was slow, like almost non existent If we didn't constantly ask for things we needed. Drinks were so unorganized and could have been done totally differently to make it run smoother but there was not enough help to do it that way. The waitress was really nice and tried her best but was way too overwhelmed and unorganized. Some of this could have been avoided by the management staying to help. Not the best place for a quick meal so prep yourself for hours !!!!",

When it was time to pay, I used a crisp $100.00 bill.  My server, who had been very pleasant, knew what bill I was paying with asked if I needed change.  I replied were you expecting an almost $80.00 tip?  When he left, my friends told me the tip was INCLUDED with the tab because we were a large party.  Once they informed me of this, I could not believe that my server had the audacity to try and SWINDLE me out of more money by using deceptive tactics that would lead a customer to assume that the tip was not included.  I am wondering if this deception is restaurant policy or just one server trying to make big bucks off of unsuspecting customers. I for one will not return to this restaurant because I do not approve of doing business dishonestly and I will be spreading the word.",

Appetizers:  Crab and spinach dip-It's so creamy and flavorful and enough for a party of three to share. Truffle Parmesan fries- Crispy and full of flavor and great for sharing. Crispy pesto gnocchi- It was my first time trying gnocchi and I was hooked. From the texture to the flavor everything was perfect. However, this appetizer was a bit heavier compared to the other two. Entree: Rice au gratin with chicken- if you love chicken and cheese, this is the perfect combo for you. The chicken was cooked perfectly with absolutely no dryness. My favorite aspect of the dish was the baked cream sauce with mozzarella.  Service: Stellar, every single time I am here I am greeted right away. You can even make reservations ahead of time if you have a big party.",

There was a mix of decorations but they all pieces together really well. There were areas of pastel colors and some of dark and cool colors!  Our service was great! However, we asked to order the Truffle Fries and ended up with the Mushroom Fries. We didn't realize the mistake until we got our check, it wasn't that big of a deal so we still paid for it but we didn't understand how you could mix up Truffle and Portobello.  The Portobello fries were nice. Definitely a different taste but it was still enjoyable. The zucchini fries were delicious.  My fiance got the Jambalaya Pasta and I got the Vegetarian Quesadilla. The Jambalaya Pasta has nice spices on it! The dish itself was scarce in taste altogether but it was still good! And the Vegetarian Quesadilla was lite and filling.   This place is definitely an option to host a rehearsal dinner party! I'll have to come back and see if it's really worth it!",

My family and I walked in while looking for a late night place to get dinner on a Saturday night (I swear, if you don't want buffet in Vegas there's barely anything else that's open late...). I love Italian food so when I heard of this spot selling some Italian cuisine, I realized I should try something new, especially here! So, back to feeling like I'm under dressed. They were very welcoming and the place looked so wonderful! i thought I was in banquet hall for a second. They said it's alright. They get that a lot. They actually have a separate bar section for those who just wanna chill and drink on the side with a divider. It's pretty smart because we didn't want to go to loud area and just wanted to have a nice, chill family dinner.   The food that we ordered here was just delicious. I know I'm biased because it was mostly Italian food, but still, they had the food looking like their spot, exquisite. The food we got was the meat lasagna, chicken Parmesan with sides of vegetables, Asian chicken salad, and a chicken sandwich. All was awesome, all were great choices to get, and all were not that expensive! The prices for these plates ranged around $10-15! At more well known \"Italian\" cuisine spots the food would be almost near 15-20. That's a big plus for me!   The service was had was great. They wee understanding to what we wanted and craved that night. They were hoping to get MORE business, and they deserve it, too. This hidden gem should be dropped by more often. I will be one of those people because I just have to try what else they have in store here. If I want a fancy birthday celebration I could just go here! Drop by this spot because it will be worth it!",

But I hate to say that I cannot agree with these reviews. Upon arrival, I thought that the atmosphere seemed charming with its decoration, although it looks nice it really felt as though there was a lot missing at the same time.    For me, I felt that the food is mediocre   I ordered the filet mignon, it was a very poor cut of meat. Lots of fat and veins throughout. It wasn't seasoned well and the veggies that came with the steak were soggy and salty.   I would go for happy hour drinks and appetizers but stay away from the entrees. At least the filet was mehhh",

Sparklings is close to their home and we had a good experience having dinner there a year or so ago, so we thought we would give their brunch menu a try. Not such a good idea. We made a reservation for 11AM (when they open). While they were seating 2 other tables, it took about 10 minutes for them to get around to showing us to a table. Several more minutes until Enderzon, our server, came by to ask about our drink orders. Nothing complicated there - just water, one coffee and one coke. While the water came out fairly quickly, it was quite a while for the coffee (yes, it was opening time, but if you're open for brunch on a Sunday, don't you have coffee ready to roll when the door opens???). Finally, we get to give our orders. Nothing fancy - 3 omelets, a short stack of pancakes, and a Benedict. The eggs got to the table a little after noon (yup, an hour after we arrived). While we ordered omelets, we got frittatas. And they weren't hot, just warmer than room temp. And the flavor was meh. We figured the pancakes would be right behind. We figured wrong. We had long finished all the eggs when Enderzon appeared with a apology about the pancakes - a new chef and he messed up the order. Really??? Pancakes. Not fancy pancakes. Just plain pancakes. Two of them. How hard is that to time so that it doesn't come out 20 minutes after the egg order? If this were just for food and service, one star would have been too generous. But the room is so pretty, I bumped it up to a second star.",

The Sparklings is located in SW Vegas off of Rainbow, and there was ample parking for our lunch today. Upon entering we were promptly greeted at the front desk. The decor throughout the restaurant is super cute and definitely makes for lovely photos. Also, we were there before noon and we had the restaurant virtually to ourselves.   A young lady provided us with water and menus immediately upon being seated.  Furthermore, we were informed that we could order breakfast or lunch since it was before noon. I was surprised at how many options there were on the lunch menu. In addition, I was even more surprised at the PRICE! Everything on the menu is so reasonable!   After debating among the options on the menu, I decided to go for the Shepard's Pie.  My friend, Carol, ordered a pasta dish. I did notice while we were waiting for our order that there were customers at the front desk who were waiting to be greeted/seated. They were unattended for some time, and I did see a previous review mention that issue. We didn't have that problem, but I did witness it. Maybe they just need to let their staff know?? Idk..  Anyway, my Shepard's Pie was huge and it was also very tasty. The biscuit portion was light and flaky. Also, the meaty interior of it was hearty and filled with fresh vegetables. I couldn't finish half of it. It truly could have fed two adults in my opinion! My friend reported her pasta tasted good, and she enjoyed the shrimp she added to it. We were both way too stuffed to order any dessert, but we did enjoy our lunch. Overall, I'd recommend stopping by here if you're in the area.   P. S. - They did have a whole bar area too -- but since it was before noon, we didn't venture that way or even preview a drink menu. Maybe next time?! :)",

We got seated fairly quick. Decor was combination of modern and elegance. This place is perfect for big get-togethers or even just for intimate dates.   I came here with my girlfriends and we all ordered different pastas which all came out delicious! We started off with gnocchi which was a delight. Entrees come in hearty portions.  They also have a massive wine list and cocktail options and prices are quite reasonable.  For dessert, we got the trio which were creme brulee, chocolate cake and an ice cream.   Definitely one of Vegas' hidden gems. I see myself becoming a regular of this place.",

Chicken wings were nice and big, lot of meat on them, didn't get any ranch or blue cheese with them. I did ask for it when I was ordering but it was forgotten.  Frankly, I was hungry, I just  wanted to eat rather than wait for ranch dressing; so, yeah...they were ok.  The Grilled Pesto Gnocchi, was good...had a great flavor (didn't know one of the ingredients was pork sausage but that is on me).  Toasted pecans were good to as a garnish on the gnocchi.  The Creme Brulee must be a staple there because one minute after ordering it was there, might not be fresh, fresh but it was good.  Great staff, 4 stars.",

We didn't mind though since we were easily able to get a table without a reservation. It's very big inside and certainly has insta worthy decor.  The menu is super vast. I'm talking like 5-6 pages of choices. I decided to go with the portobello fries and the brown butter gnocchi. These two combined were just enough for me portion wise. The fries were tasty and I liked the spicy orange sauce. The gnocchi was my favorite. It was a bit crispy and not too overly sweet. Of course you can't have brunch without bottomless mimosas. They offered a couple different flavors and I liked that they just leave a carafe on the table.   I'd come back again to try more options. It'd be a great spot for a birthday party or large group event.",

After an extended lunch/drinks girls date, this place is definitely my newest food crush in Vegas!   So many amazing things to say but let's just keep it to the three most important: food, service, atmosphere- all on point!   The menu is huge and reasonably priced; they have just as many selections in the full bar. I was putting down their Arnold Palmer inspired drink with sweet tea vodka way too easily! We had a bunch of snacks too; my fave was the Gorgonzola flatbread.   Service was great- our servers/bartenders worked as a seamless, friendly, and accommodating team! Between talking and so many tempting choices on the menu, it took at least 5 visits before I made up my mind and as frustrating as that is to deal with as a server, they didn't show even the slightest irritation. When they happened upon a few \"hot button\" topics in the conversation, they responded in a lighthearted and simple manner that definitely alleviated any awkwardness.   We had a private and comfortable booth in their Instagram worthy dining area which made it that much easier to hang out probably twice as long as originally intended and loving every minute!   Can't wait to be back at the soonest reasonable opportunity..happy hour is in the near future for sure!",

After getting seated and taking orders for our bottomless mimosas, our server comes back and tells us they were out of champagne!!! Say what?!?   I was so excited to brunch here, everything on their menu sounded delicious but the mimosas were the deal breaker. Sad to give such a low rating but I wish we had known earlier that they were out of champagne. It would have saved us a trip here.   Giving two stars cus the interior was super cute! We even had a separate room for our party. I guess I'd have to come back for dinner or another occasion when they do have champagne.",

We came here during the day time and it was surprisingly quiet and almost empty (a few patrons were in the restaurant). We were greeted by an awesome waiter named Jason and his service was superb.  Tasted the prime rib which was by far the best prime rib I've ever had. It was very tender and almost melted like butter in my mouth. Their crab spinach cheese dip which was also delicious. As far as their Jumbalaya, it was a bit too salty.  Moderately priced. Overall great, I'd like to come to this restaurant again and try more of what they have on their menu.",

It's located in the Southwest part of town, near the Blue Diamond area.  The restaurant itself is very spacious and there's a beautiful chandelier in the center of the restaurant.  There's more of the long table seating and humongous booths than there is for couples.  Unfortunately, it was DEAD on a Saturday night.  Very surprising considering it is \"Valentine's Day\" weekend.. although there were several others dining it, it was just a bit too quiet that night.  As for the food, we ordered: - Calamari salad for an appetizer (A-ok.. I wouldn't order again) - Crispy gnocchi with italian sausage and peas (the sauce was very tasty!  however the more I kept eating, the more I felt it was a bit too creamy and heavy for my liking) - Cajun Chicken and Shrimp Pasta (yummy & tasty.. sauce was just right) Prices were overall reasonable.  For our meal, we spent just about $30 or so.  Server we had was nice and just the right amount of attentiveness.  Overall I think I can give this restaurant one more try.  I hope they expand a bit more on their menu.",

With that being said our waiter Tyler was very cute and nice. He was patient, service was great and put up with my jokes. The food was good..I don't know if I ordered the right things though. Calamari, sweet potatoes fries, and the pesto pasta. Fries were...fries but the sauces were good. Calamari...calamari. The pastas was good just very heavy. We also ordered some cocktails which were great. Anywhere with copper MM cups have won me over. All and all I think this place was good...change up the music and I think it will be even better!",

There honestly isn't a single bad seat in the entire restaurant.   We kept things simple with lunch with the club sandwich that was massive, had a couple of beers and the crispy gnocchi which was recommended by the waiter. All was super Delish and lucky me, I live a block away. Will definitely be coming back.   Also- love that the bar/gaming area is seperate to the restaurant.",

We usually order a bunch of different appetizers, or as you call it \"tapas style\". Everything is so good & unique! The flavors are amazing & the service is always good & attentive. The grilled chicken wings, diver scallops, & pesto gnocchi is a must try! Oh & did I mention reasonable prices?! All apps under $10!",

    "text": "I feel sort of obligated to give them 5 stars, why... because they're just that awesome! Upon walking in, you will notice the amazing decor. Ambiance really made me give this place 5 stars, it is so beautiful I think they may have even hired a design team. White furniture, with pistachio green cushions. The chandelier is the focal point of the restaurant and gives it the restaurant's name sake \"The Sparklings.\"  I came on a Wednesday during lunch and it was totally empty. I guess this is more of a dinner spot, but surprisingly the server said they are kind of busy on the weekends, but not so much. Sort of surprising considering how amazing this place is. So definitely people give them your business! Now on to the food, to start our meal we ordered the seafood bruschetta, so delicious! Loved it and the drizzle of pesto sauce made the dish look even more appetizing. For my main entree I had the jambalaya, something I've never had before. It was pretty good, but I was expecting a little bit more spice and flavor to it. To me it just tasted like chicken, seafood and tomato paste mixed with white rice.  I think it was definitely missing something but I can't exactly put my finger on since it was my first time having it. I think maybe it needed a garnish of scallions on top and the dish itself could of used more garlic? It was only $13 which is very reasonable for me because it was the perfect portion size. All the prices here are very affordable, the most expensive thing is the filet mignon at $25, which I consider almost robbery. My friend had the beat salad which he enjoyed very much. We shared the cheesecake as our dessert, this was totally store bought cheesecake and the server even admitted it not being made on site. I wish they had more dessert options, but the flour-less cake sounded good, I might have to order that next time. As Daniel T. mentioned it might be better to order 2 or 3 appetizers rather than an entree because the appetizers are all mouth watering.",

We ordered the tuna tartar which tasted really good but the avocados were hard. Also had the fries which we both didn't taste the truffle. Entrees I had the steak Diane menu says its fillet but it's not! At least what I got wasn't fillet. The sauce/gravy was a salty as per the other reviews. I don't think I would order that if I were to go here again. Also had the salmon which was really good the rice it came with was really good. I asked for the lemon sauce on the side which was a smart idea. We then got the trio dessert the flourless cake was hard and looked & tasted like a brownie. The creme burle was pretty good not the best I've had but not the worst. Ice cream was good. The service was good and prompt except for our app dishes weren't removed before the main courses came out.",

We weren't treated very nicely, an afterthought really. Felt it was because we were dressed down a bit and weren't ordering the pricier meals. We both decided on pasta dishes that turned out to be very poorly done. No one ever came back to refill our water and the check was dropped off tableside without asking if we wanted dessert (it was a special occasion, we were up for it, but it wasn't offered). Very cold service, even paying the check. We left feeling mistreated and won't forget this experience.   Decided that we won't be back and will share our experience here, as well as with friends & family so they can avoid being treated this way as well. Sad. We're southside locals and it's disappointing to not be able to support a restaurant on our side of town.",

We brought our own bottle of wine, but the corkage is a little excessive at $30 so we ended up buying a bottle there for that same price.  Started with the scallops and my oh my they were delightful!!!! omg so effing good..we were excited about our entrees. we both got the salmon and subbed the rice for mashed potatoes. So good!!  The only thing I have to say about the place and we did end up talking to the manager about this so I do hope they take it into consideration....(reason for the missing star)  The inside with the chandelier is as bright as the sun! not romanic at all.Music was very low and could hear the clanking of the silverware around as everyone is eating...and the low mumbling of conversations.  Ambience is so so important...and being that it's a big room...the lights need to be dimmed and music louder.period.otherwise it can be really awkward. I dont care if people complain the lights are too dim and they can't read the menu...get your cellphone out and read it that way.  I would feel so awkward going on a date here with the brightness of the restaurant. It's funny because the sign outside is so dim too...it needs to be switched around!  OK in summary it's a beautiful place and the food was delightful would recommend going!.... just take the lights down a notch! EASY FIX.  We will be back!  Oh yea and service was excellent!",

I made a reservation in advance, they placed us on the side bench with tables and chairs uncomfortably pushed together. We had about 13 people. The large dining table across from us was empty where they eventually sat a party of 5 later on in the evening. We asked for another table to be added to the end and the blonde server said no they don't have any, even though there were empty tables in the private dining area. Server looked like she didn't want to be there. We had to ask for e-v-e-r-y-t-h-i-n-g! Refills several times --we all had water. Asked for extra place settings where the server returned with just utensils. So we have to be specific and ask for the plates too? Server disappeared from table upon taking our orders.  Sometimes people need more time to decide on what they want to eat--especially that big of a party. A proper excusal such as \"Would you like more time to decide?\" would be nice.  The timing of the food was a bummer.  Once the last person got their food everyone was pretty much done. Upon paying the check, they gave us 1 pen to share amongst all of us to pay our portion. In the hospitality industry, you're suppose to anticipate needs. We were the biggest party in the restaurant and why we were overlooked behooves me.  Dude, I was so embarrassed I recommended this place because of the great reviews. Such a bummer.",

Our waiter, Jason, was great. He was very personable and attentive. The food was good. We got the bacon & dates wrapped meatballs, gorgonzola flatbread with honey, and seared diver scallops appetizers. The flatbread was not crispy, it was chewy, and a little on the oily side. It wasn't bad, just not what we were expecting. Our entrees were the cajun chicken and shrimp pasta, jambalaya, spicy seafood pasta, and pan-seared atlantic salmon. They were all very tasty. No complaints. Definitely coming back.",

The last few times we've come,  there is a tall Asian manager that we hadn't seen before.   Since we've started seeing him, the bar staff seem to be absolutely miserable and always fighting about stuff. They're also obviously annoyed at the kitchen who keep screwing up customer orders which get delivered by food runners to tables as soon as they're ready.... Even if a table orders 2 large dishes to eat as mains.     Last 2 times we came,  one of us was done our meal before the second one was even delivered.   Nobody noticed, nobody made sure that the person waiting at least had a drink,  and the food was nowhere as good as it used to be.     We won't be returning.  Former 5 star review:   Amazing food.  The dining room is way too bright, but the bar area is fantastic.  Since we sit at the bar, we will be back for sure!!!",

Food is fantastic and great value across the board (favorites: crispy gnocchi, bacon and date meatballs, mussel \"soup\"). Staff is very friendly, knowledgable, and seems to work hard. Ambiance and decor make the experience unique and memorable. Will be back many times in the future, there were about 20 things that sounded amazing but my girlfriend and I weren't hungry enough to try. Also we were just trying to have a relaxing night and showed up in sweats and gym shorts and were not judged one bit for it nor treated disrespectfully by anybody. Very refreshing and different from some other dining experiences I've had in Vegas (*cough* Wynn *cough*)  :)",

We made a reservation based on the good reviews but it was clear we didn't need one since it was practically empty. I have to say a pretty nice decor and nice atmosphere but then again to me it's about the food. It was just sub par. But I'm from New York and to have to pay for bread that came with only enough butter for one slice of bread really put me over the top, no salt and pepper on the table and couldn't find a waiter when I needed extra Parmesan . For me and my husband we'll never return. I'd say skip it. Zest was so much better. And I'm just saying as a New Yorker.",

The decor was beautiful, the atmosphere was chill, and the food was amazing. The waiter was nice and friendly, but pretty average service. The place was quite empty when we arrived, so we got seated right away.  Me and my friends ordered beers, the sweet potato fries, fried zucchini, bruschetta, and caesar salad as our appetizers. I was a bit irritated that the bruschetta on the menu did not state that it had seafood in it, as one of my friends is severely allergic to seafood. Good thing I tried it before he did, and immediately tasted the crab meat. I suggest they change the menu and put stars next to their seafood products as an indicator, because it only says \"cream cheese, avocado, and onion\" as the toppings. It was still quite delicious, but my friend was the one who ordered it and couldn't even enjoy it or try it.  As our main course selections I ordered the spicy seafood pasta. It was the perfect amount of spice and the seafood tasted fresh! And I'm usually very picky with how I like my seafood. Two of my friends both ordered the bacon and mushroom pasta, which I tasted. It was also delicious. My other friend had the clam linguini, which he thought was delicious as well, although I didn't try any.   Overall, I gave 4 stars because the atmosphere and food was really good. I enjoyed it and would come back again. The only reason I docked 1 star was because of the lack of labeling of which appetizers have seafood. If he took a bite of it before I did, we would have ditch that place and make a trip to the ER fast!! Luckily that didn't happen!",

We ended up in the bar, and a cozy little sitting area. The smiling server brought menus right over! One of the friends that we were with has a serious wheat allergy. No not some annoying hipster \"gluten allergy\" but a serious face swells up like a ball allergy. I have seen photos, it is not pretty!  So...we asked our server what he could have on the menu, and the server cheerfully boasted \"Honey, 99% of that menu has wheat in it! You can have a salad and that is about it\" Then told us most restaurants don't have gluten free items here in Las Vegas....OK, we will agree to disagree. And wish there were more gluten free options on this menu.  Once we got over that moment, we ordered some food. (Yes my friend had a salad, no dressing because we were told they make salad dressing with wheat as well)   He had a steak salad and tuna tartar, hold the soy sauce on the tartar. I had the sausage pesto pasta and it was awesome!   Overall we had a great time, now I really want to go back and sit in the dining room. Which is beautiful BTW! Still holding out hope that the next time will live up to the hype! It was almost there the first time!",

It's a beautiful space, modern and sophisticated, but completely comfortable for any mood you're in. I've shown up in a cocktail dress and also in post-workout gear. Every seat in the place is comfortable - and I've pretty much sat in them all.   The service is impeccable and consistent. The manager, Andy, is now a good friend.  I've ordered about 90% of the menu, and it's all delicious. The only reason I haven't ordered the other 10% is because 1) I don't eat pork, 2) I'm lactose intolerant and there are a few items they can't alter enough for me. But they will always try. The bartenders Ray and Jose are the sweetest boys you could want behind a bar. They make tasty drinks, too.  I've thrown parties here, had surprise parties thrown for me here, brought all my friends here and celebrated my last birthday with my family here only two days ago. Now it's your turn. Go!   (And order the clam linguini, and the scallops, and the hamburger steak which is an extra tasty loco moco. And the grilled octopus, and the chicken breast sandwich, and...)",

It was a Sunday night the place only had a few other people at the bar and restaurant so it felt like we had the place to ourselves which was nice. The service was excellent and the food was great! It wasn't crazy over priced like restaurants on \"the strip\" and it was just as good or better. Definitely a great hidden spot just 10 minutes for the strip. We will be coming back :)",

Unique restaurant as the set up is elegant with different dinner tables set around, giving each set of guest the feel of having that fancy elegant private dinners. It's pretty awesome that they even have small private table areas and rooms. The menu is awesome as well. Prices are fair and reasonable since the taste is so good. You must get the crispy gnocchi, tuna tartare, crispy scallops and seafood pasta! Hehe all so good, and the workers are very friendly as well. I love this place and definitely recommend to come here for a nice date, or special occasion :)",

    "text": "if i opened a restaurant, it would look exactly like this - it's like my pinterest page came to life. i'm completely in love w/ the decor! i'll admit that i first decided to try sparklings mainly because the name was cute, i thought it was a bar, and it's close to my house.   same owner as oyshi and soyo (another neighborhood fav), but you wouldn't know it because there's really nothing korean about sparkling other than some of the staff. i'll be honest and say that this review is mainly just on them as a bar, since i've so far only gone for after dinner drinks.    the menu is a little scattered - pasta, bacon/date meatballs, shrimp po boy? i've only tried the crispy gnocchi so far - an appetizer portion was only $7.50, but enough for me as an entree (with a cocktail). the gnocchi itself wasn't that great, but it was a decent dish overall with the peas, sauce and everything else.   i love love the bartenders here, and would come back even without their awesome daily happy hour till 10pm (30% off all drinks). i like fluffy drinks, and sparklings has a full bar including lots of flavored alcohols to experiment with.  there are no food specials for HH, but their pricing is reasonable anyway. i'm honestly not sure why we haven't tried sparklings for dinner yet. probably because i've been on a huge asian kick lately, so if they could make some korean dishes here, i'd be in heaven...    the only negative is that i HATE the music they play. it kind of varies between different kinds of easy listening. michael buble is fine, but they also play a lot of instrumental kenny g type stuff. i get that they're going for upscale and classy, but please play somethng else - i can't stand the music.   i guess they only opened about a month ago, so it's been pretty empty every time i've been here. the place will probably become packed as more people learn it exists - it's perfect for a neighborhood date night. they have a decent sized private dining room, and even have great indoor and outdoor patio seating - can't wait to try it out in the spring!",

A bar is on the other side of the restaurant and there were two big screen tvs.  The host greeted us and let us choose our table.  He was very attentive to us and a few other groups he was waiting on.  We got our menus and glasses of ice water and perused our menus.  We ordered a few appetizers; Parmesan Truffle fries and the Crispy Gnochhi.  My boyfriend ordered the Jambalaya and I ordered the braised short ribs.  The appetizers were yummy.  The gnocchi was really flavorful and the fries were crisp and topped with tons of Parmesan.  My boyfriend liked his Jambalaya, but it was a little salty.  My braised ribs were so tender the meat fell off the bones.  And the sauce was fantastic!  The food and service was excellent.  The best part is they are located not far from our house, so we will definitely go again!",

This was my second time here and both of my experiences were amazing. You're greeted as soon as you walk in and we were seated immediately. Our server's name was Eric and he did an amazing job and maintained awesome service. He had a very positive attitude and made us feel welcomed. The first time I tried this place I was served by Tyler and he was great as well! Tyler and Eric are good. We ordered the truffle fries as an appetizer and I got the Cajun chicken and shrimp pasta. They give a good amount of fries and it was enough to satisfy the 5 of us. I really enjoyed my Cajun chicken and shrimp pasta as all the flavors blended really well. The portion is very generous. The main course options can range anywhere from $9-$30+ depending on what you order. This place is definitely affordable while upholding a fancy upscale vibe. Definitely will be back!",

The food just did not really stick out to me much, I went with a group of friends and we literally ordered everything on the appetizer menu (which is huge!!!!!), I remember I hated the crab dip, sooo fishy it killed it for me. But i did like the sliders those were good, tuna tartar was good as well! Yet I do not really know if I liked or disliked the food there.

No, we did not want separate checks, thank you very much, Next, we were informed when ordering coffee, that Sparklings Does Not have coffee. \"Only Expresso with no free refills\", as she put it. C'mon, buy a dang coffee maker! I will say the food was good; pork chops big and juicy, beet salad yummy. My only other complaint, the guy cleaning tables was over-zealous with a toxic spray bottle.

    "text": "Outstanding!  We were expecting good food based on the reviews here, and they were right.  The food was exceptional. Flavorful, but not over spiced.  The raw ingredients allowed to shine through.   The crispy Gnocchi was fantastic.  A full bodied pesto with great flavor.  Even a simple appetizer like the zucchini fries was excellently prepared and delivered in a whimsical presentation.  Great stuff.  The Chicken with Rice au gratin was as others have described it \"The Bomb\".  Rich, with great flavors. A single dish is enough  for 4 people to share at the table.  I now understand why one reviewer orders one to go at the end of a meal.  Our entrees were all great The steak, the pasta, etc. were all perfectly prepared and artfully presented.  The service was good.  Very attentive.  Appetizers came right up, and there was no pressure to order our entrees.  Bar service was good, but not high pressure.  A very pleasant experience.  The ambience is peaceful.  Because of the high ceilings the noise from the other patrons is muted.  There is plenty of space between tables, and you don't have to listen to the conversations of other parties.  Speaking of parties I noticed what looked like a child's birthday party at the long table when we walked in. I cringed, because the noise from that type of function has spoiled a few meals for me.  I was relieved when we were seated - and  I realized that I could not hear 18 little girls carrying on.  It was wonderful.  We will definitely go back.  Our dinner guests were impressed.  Great place!",

Angelo is always our bartender and he is phenomenal! Very personable, friendly, and attentive when it comes to our drinks and requests.   They have Wasatch on draft, a delicious white IPA. They also have Happy Hour DAILY from 5 PM - 10 PM where drinks are 30% off! This includes bottles of wine... which makes it an excellent idea to enjoy Happy Hour here.

We sat and waited about 5-8 minutes to be greeted and get our drink orders taken which also gave us time to have our whole order placed appetizers and entrees.  We order the crispy pesto gnocchi which was pretty good but rich to eat alone. We also had the langosta bruschetta which had a beautiful display but underwhelming taste.  Our meals came out and we were not impressed. I had the shrimp tempura pasta with mushrooms. Looked nice, the pasta had a pretty good flavor but I could have gone without the breaded shrimp. It was soggy and I couldn't eat it at all cause the thought alone made me gag. My brother had the cheesesteak and they had kraft cheese on it and it was pretty bland. My friend had the clam pasta and it had so many shells in it but we weren't sure why.  We tried to pay for our bill and after waiting for 10 minutes we decided to just go to the host stand to pay. We literally could have dined and dashed and they would have never known (I would never btw but it was tempting at the level of disappointment we had)",

Okay now onto why they only get 2 stars. First off service is extremely slow. This place is hardly busy, I've been quite a few times and there was never more than 2-3 tables, that's being generous. I've also gone at different times and days and it's always the same. The host will seat you just fine but service from there isn't the best. Not saying the staff isn't friendly, they are just not responsive, upbeat, and food time to table is slow.  They have a large menu and from pictures I have taken you can see presentation is done well but food is not very flavorful. It's pretty bland.   Only would go back because it was so close to our house so if we wanted a seat down American food meal we would come here but would not be my first choice.",

It's separated off in a cute little corner of the restaurant but the bartenders can make a mean Jameson and ginger ale. And it's great because it has its own little seating area to just sit and relax and watch some sports on the big screen tv if that's what you wanna do.  However. This place is more of a \"dress up and look spiffy while eating\" kind of joint. Which I'm all for. The decor is so cute inside and more upscale than just the regular/casual restaurant.  My friend and I ordered and shared the langostuine bruschetta (bomb! 10/10) and the spaghetti with mushroom and bacon cream sauce with shrimp. It was very good (9/10) but tasted heavy on the sauce. We tasted a bit of the pesto gnocchi and thought it was alright, nothing special (7/10).   But. I must say. I tried a bite of the medium rare filet mignon and a few bites of the coffee tempura ice cream. AND OH MY GOODNESS. I will come back o this place every day if it means I get to taste such beautiful creations.   PS ask for Eric, he's a very good server. Nice guy.",

Service: Service was great, the waiter was attentive to our needs, and the small requests to be changed in our food  was well received.   Food: Food has been good, I ordered the steak diane and requested the beef to be cooked medium and my order turned out great. My wife ordered the Spicy Seafood pasta minus the spice. The spice was definitely removed, the pasta however was not al dente and  was swimming in sauce.   Overall: I would definitely come back to try the other entrees, dining experience is great since the place is conducive to socializing.

We were met by two men at the front door, let them know we were going to the bar, they acknowledged us and we proceeded to find a seat. The bar was busy, great music but no bartender. 5 minutes later the same guy that greeted us at the door shows up behind the bar and handed us menus. He rambled off something really fast, and when I asked him to repeat what he said, he said in a slow, as to make fun of me not understanding him the first time, something about any thing with alcohol is 30% off. And then looked at me as though I was stupid. Again he disappears. My company went to find someone to take our order that wasn't the smart ass with the horrible hair style. When a nice guy walked over, I ordered off their menu to be told they no longer make that drink. The whole vibe was crazy the smart ass bartender was now starring us down ... I let my company know that I wanted to leave. Wish I had the same experience that my friends have, but this asshat will never get my business and I will now let everyone I know what kind of treatment I was given. There are hundreds of bars in Vegas, what keeps them in business is great employees that keep people in the seats!! Horrible experience...on a positive note we walked across the freezing cold parking to the lodge and service by Nick has been amazing so far!",

The decor is perfect.I don't even know what to call it, we actually debated it for a good chunk of time while sitting back admiring.  Until the food came and then it was game on! We started with the portabello fries and also the roasted beet and apple salad.  The salad was good but those fries, daaaayyum. Not overly fried, yummy flavor.  Just do it, they were excellent.   For an entree, I ordered the spicy seafood pasta, at the recommendation of our delightful server.  It was in fact, spicy, it was also chock-full overflowing with seafood.  It did not disappoint.  But I'm going to go ahead and repeat - it was SPICY.  Just in case you think it's only a hint of spice, nooooo.  It's some damn good heat. A friend ordered the shepherd's pie and damn if it didn't look glorious. The crust was flakey, buttery goodness.  There were 4 of us including a vegetarian and a vegan and EVERYONE loved this place.  That's a pretty difficult thing to pull off.  Just sayin' Dessert - because we had too.  We got the trio which included flourless chocolate cake, vanilla ice cream, and creme brulee.  OH THAT CREME BRULEE! Delightful.  Scrumptious! The cake was great, I didn't even try the ice cream. I was too full and I needed to eat more of the creme brulee! So if you can't tell. I think this place is the bee's knees and I will most certainly be back on all of my trips to Vegas.",

They left the water pitcher on our table and made my friend feel uncomfortable. I guess they left it there knowing it'd be a while before they came around again. Since it was a large group, they presumed we were all just sitting around mingling except we waiting an hour before getting asked if we wanted entrees. As for food, it was good but not anything I would come back for. We had the bacon date meatballs, Caesar salad, short ribs,  rib eye, Cajun pasta, crispy gnocchi,  seafood pasta, and sweet potato fries. Best was the short ribs.",

They have so many great drinks on the menu & everything tastes like candy. We had a few cocktails and really enjoyed the variety. The drinks were really good and creative. I ordered the raspberry bourbon mule and my wife a raspberry lemon drop. Let me just say, our martinis was made with fresh muddled raspberries and tasted perfect; the equal parts alcohol and equal parts raspberries and pink sugar around the glass rim were on point. it was a great choice! I loved the decor so elegant, but comfortable. The atmosphere at the bar and restaurant is really nice so it felt like we had the place to ourselves which was nice. The service was excellent and the food was great! I started with the French Onion Soup which was amazing! The broth, the bread and the gooey cheese made the best French Onion soup I've had to date. My wife chose the Rice Au Gratin with chicken. It was creamy she was also curious about grape, basil and ricotta flat bread so we definitely had to order that! It was also topped with candied walnuts, arugula and drizzled with balsamic. It wasn't crazy over priced like restaurants on \"the strip\" and it was just as good or better. Definitely a great hidden spot just 10 minutes for the strip. We will be coming back :)",

I got to try Caesar salad, a smoked salmon appetizer that I loved, a kind of flatbread with arugala, balsalmic dressing and red grapes, garlic parmesean fries, and a chicken sandwich with mayonnaise, tomato and avocado.  The food was pretty decent but the salmon and caper appetizer was my favorite.  Inside the Sparklings was very cute and exactly how I like my home to be- lots of grey walls with white trim, a huge sparkly Chandelier in the middle and large glass hurricanes filled with pink orchids.  The only real shame was the restroom.  The ladies restroom was a complete travesty and disgusting.  I went to walk in the large stall since I am pregnant and I had to walk directly out.  It looked like there was white powder all over the toilet that someone must have thrown up in.  I don't know how long that throw up had been there but the bathroom was so rank I could only imagine how long.  It was a turnoff to the rest of the place unfortunately.  I don't think I would be back because the restroom was THAT bad.  No matter how cute the place was and how decent the food was I'm sorry that was an image breaker.",

They came out promptly, almost fast food fast, but they tasted nothing of fast food. Loved both, would totally order again. I ordered the short ribs for dinner and my husband the ribeye. I LOVED my short ribs but I have to say, his steak was not worth $25. It was something you'd get at, as he put it, the truck stop except they call it a skirt steak. It was thin, poorly seasoned, and really not what I'd expect for even a $15 steak, much less $25. All in all it was a good meal, id just not recommend the steak. We ended with a flour less chocolate cake that was heavenly. Presentation on all the food was that of a fine dining establishment, the service was extraordinary, and the decor is modern/contemporary/southern. I will defiantly be eating here again, and it's for sure a place to bring company!",

He led us to the bar but we asked if we could sit at the big booth next to it and he said of course. We started with a Caesar salad, the French Onion SoupThe Caesar had a great flavor, the onion soup was really good, I also got the spinach and crab dip. The breads that come with it are amazing, especially the crispy one. For our mains my wife got the butternut squash gnocch and Ricotta Grape and Arugula Flat bread and my wife adored the flat bread, and I got the Rib Eye with a wine sauce, mashed potatoes, and asparagus. The Steak was amazing and a perfect medium. I particularly loved the wine sauce that comes on it and Jose brought an extra side of it for me without me even asking. He was so polished that it was surreal. He was polite, on point with pre bussing and refills and at one point I dropped by fork while eating my steak and before my wife had even completed offering me her's to use he was already there with a new roll up. I am in the field and a high volume and high class restaurant and I was still way impressed. The food itself was delicious, the ambiance was really nice with nice music, and the service was phenomenal. I highly recommend coming here, especially late night and you should hope you get Jose.",

    "text": "Came in last night for dinner after bookmarking this place awhile back. The atmosphere of the place definitely makes it seem more expensive than it actually is. It's a big main room with a bar and a side room but the room is used sparingly so it gives it a really big and open feel which is pretty nice. Our server was Jason and he was great he was very interested in our little baby and was quick with the order refills and making conversation. We wanted to try some different plates so we got the calamari and scallops for appetizers. The calamari was pretty basic but my gf asked for remoulade which I thought was better then the marinara. The scallops were pretty good but I don't feel you get enough since half the pieces are the rice. For our actual menu I got the chicken wings and she got the Cajun chicken and shrimp pasta. The chicken wings were alright but like some people have said I think they would be better with some crisp in them. Pasta was quote \"soooo good\" but since I'm not a fan of spicy I opted out. For dessert we of course got the trio sampler and the creme brulee was delicious although the flourless cake id really rename \"fudge\" all in all we will come back eventually. Cheap food, expensive feel, and great service.",

I would say the dish as a whole was great.  sauce was good, lots of seafood and large scallops.  only problem was the mussels were horrific.  they were spoiled rotten or something.  they smelled like poop.  I could not eat it.  the mussels pretty much ruined the entire dish for me.  not sure what was going on with the mussels, but they all smelled bad.  I'm iffy about going back after my experience.",

We ordered the gnocchi, sliders, ribeye steak, walnut beet salad and chicken fingers for the kids. Gnocchi was ok, sliders were the worst I've ever had, salad dressing was bland and served with beets from a can, chicken fingers looked like they came from Costco's frozen isle with a side of Hidden Valley ranch (cannot be mistaken), and the steak was an embarrassment for them to even send out! We asked for our steak to be prepared \"medium\" and it was far past well-done. Because the steak was so gray in color and lacked flavor we thought they may have boiled it...gross! In addition, service was horrible since they had 2 waiters for the entire restaurant while they were quite busy.  The decor looks really nice from the entrance but the minute you sit and look around you nothing makes sense. Never going back!   Ps.soap dispensers in restrooms do not work",

It was delicious. The portion sizes are just right. Service was good even though a little slow - seems like maybe they are working out the kinks.

I called to see if the bar had TVs to watch the game and Tyler answered the phone. He told me that they had a big party coming in but because it was our anniversary he would save us a seats at the bar. When we arrived there were two seats with menus waiting for us. Tyler remembered us and also remembered to wish us a happy anniversary! He was awesome. Our bartender Anthony was great too. Awesome customer service. Now to the food! We had the spinach and crab dip which came out hot and cheesy! We ordered a bottle of wine as well with their 30% off at the bar. What a gem to find here in Vegas. I had the crispy  gnocchi as a meal and my boyfriend had the Cajun chicken and shrimp pasta which both were amazing! We finished off our dinner with a flourless chocolate cake dessert. Overall I would highly recommend this place!",

First, the positives:  1) gnocchi in pesto appetizer was awesome 2) food came out piping hot (and not the plate), love it 3) staff/manager came by multiple times after receiving our dinners to check on us 4) really like the well lit dining room including decor 5) wife had spaghetti w/meat sauce - appeared to have dissected a meatball or 2 for the sauce  The negatives: 1) took almost 10 minutes from being seated to having someone stop by the table to take a drink order (I understand busy, but my rule is if someone doesn't at least acknowledge your presence within first 10, roll out, was very close) 2) I had the jambalaya, and while shrimp/chicken were well represented, sausage was non-existent  Overall, will certainly return, too many appetizers to attempt and too little stomach availability on this visit.",

The restaurant only had about 3 other tables to serve, one of which was large, so it is unclear if our server had too many people to help, there wasn't enough staff, or the service is not their strength.",

For our entree I ordered the Cajun chicken and shrimp pasta and the BF ordered the spicy seafood pasta. As the waiter suggested, he ordered it mild spicy because the level of spice is between 6-10. (If you're not that into spicy food I suggest to have it mild spicy).   Over all my experience was great and so was the food!",

    "text": "This is definitely a hidden gem off of the strip.  Finally something hip and upscale and you don't have to deal with tourist.  I would have never expected a place like this from the owners of Oyshi and Soyo. Totally different aura and atmosphere from the others. There's a vintage hipster feel with a nice twist on the music.  Definitely a great place to bring a date or to celebrate a birthday with a group of friends.   Now on to the important stuff. Food :) We had an array of appetizers to start and ended up sharing a meal. We started with the langosta bruschetta which was to die for. Bread was perfectly crisp and didn't break into pieces when you bit into it. The added mango was a perfect addition to the topping.  We also had the sea scallops which had a little twist to them. Originally, I thought the entire plate was made up of only scallops but was soon to find out that they added crispy rice which when eaten with the scallop was amazing!   We also had the crispy gnocchi with pesto and walnuts which was also good and the fried zucchini. After trying all of the appetizers we could have skipped the zucchini. It wasn't bad but compared to the others it didn't compare.   Lastly, we had the spicy seafood spaghetti. I am super picky with Italian food because I grew up with an Italian stepfather who could cook up a storm.  But I was so happy with this dish.  The spicy tomato sauce had a great kick and the taste was perfect to what I am used to. Spaghetti was al dente but I actually like it a little harder (if you know what I mean :). We ended this delicious meal with a perfect ending of creme brulee. Equally as good as the rest.    Once the word gets out this place is gonna be crazy! Enjoy it while you can. It's only been open for 5 months.  A must try!",

    "text": "The Sparklings is such a cool and unique new restaurant. I love it! The first thing you notice about the place is the atmosphere. There's a beautiful chandelier in the center of the room and there are individual dining rooms that are separated so it's almost like you are eating in your own private dining room. Then there's an area that reminds me of a kitchen with a line of china cabinets along the wall. Outside of the main room there is a separate bar area that you can see thru glass windows. You have to see the place yourself to appreciate their whole vibe that they've got going on and it's hard to explain, just trust me. It's a place you're going to want to come to and take guests to, to impress them when they come in from out of town. It's just one of those quirky-chic spots that you will always remember.  Jason, our quick witted server was great! I have a good little banter going on with him every time I visit which makes my experience fun.  My absolute favorite thing to order is the Spicy Seafood Pasta. It has the perfect amount of kick and garlic to it. Noodles are always cooked perfectly. And there's a lot more to the menu that I haven't gotten to try yet. I tend to be a creature of comfort though and if it ain't broke don't fix it so I find myself sticking to my old faithful Spicy Seafood Pasta when I eat here. Some favorites that I recommend would be definitely that along with the Crispy Gnocchi.  My only suggestion to the owners of The Sparklings would be to add more main course dishes to their menu. Lots of appetizers to choose from but not much to choose from in the main dish department. Other than that, I have no complaints. They treat me well and remember me and what I order every time right down to the smallest detail, for example: the crushed red peppers I like on the side. Don't even have to ask. Service is excellent! 5 stars. :D",

The food was hit or miss. The light and fluffy crispy gnocchi had great flavor and a nice variety of textures. Unfortunately, that was the highlight of the meal. The tuna tartare was dominated by an acidic and fruity flavor. The meatballs stuffed with dates and bacon were ok but the sauce lacked depth. Then there was the octopus... I like eating octopus when it's slices or chunks of large tentacles. The version here is presented as 3 tiny, whole octopi. I can't say I was a fan. Too chewy even for normal octopus standards.  They do have a kid's menu, so that's a plus for anyone with a family. Service was great, but then again there was only one other party there.",

I waited months and months for it to open and even asked \"when are you opening\" to a construction worker once :)  It is truly amazing the remodel that was done inside of this building. The inside used to have private hibachi rooms for goodness sake.   The ambiance of the former sushi joint  is now an updated and posh Martha Stewart worthy lounge. Whatever the hell that means, I just made it up. Sounds weird huh? Just look at the pics it's truly lovely. The chandelier that everyone takes pics of and talks about is magical.  The menu is a more causal (Sage like) menu. Modern American Fusion? Who cares about the title. It's just good food.   We have not ordered entrees here YET because we have already had dinner or were on our way to dinner on our visits.   They said that they can accommodate to vegan for us no problem. I look forward to a pasta or a special custom creation. The items that we have had (so far) are very good.  Portobello fries, flat bread, salads....wine, wine, and more wine :)  The service is super accommodating, almost too much service. I guess because they are newer they want to help and help a lot. Lol.  The over-service was only in the dining area. In the lounge the service is perfect.  I truly love the way the did the garage door in the lounge and the way the patio area looks.  I really want to sit in that left hand side back lounge booth with a ton of people. It's really soooo big it could fit 10+++ people. I love it. Their left side dining area private table would make a large gathering super fun.    I will update when we order full entrees and remember to take more pics since we are here soo much.   Just go, it's a marvelous addition to the beautiful SW area. I am proud to be a regular.     Oh and hubby said no I could not redecorate our whole house like the inside of The Sparklings :(((((((;  ;)",

Call me old fashioned, but I've always wanted to be a cozy person that lived in a cozy neighborhood -- and for some reason cozy to me means being a regular at a handful of places that I take visiting friends to and in turn they envy me living in all my glorious coziness.  Ah, I digress.... The Sparklings took FOREVER to open but it was definitely worth the wait --- and NOT what I expected. The interior and ambiance are unmatched. It is not the type of place you'd expect to share a parking lot with Cheeburger Cheeburger. Think cufflinks and caviar...okay maybe that's a stretch but when you walk through the doors, you can't help but be impressed with the decor and detailed interior. Marble top bars, faux leather bar chairs, dim lighting...and the touch of elegance from floor to ceiling.  With that said, it's not the place you'd expect to see 'Shrimp Po Boy' or 'Club Sandwich on the menu....and that's what makes it good.....good different. The prices, menu selection, and ambiance make this a twist that works for me. It could be a formal dinner date on a Wednesday or a casual Friday happy hour.  On my first visit we ordered portobello fries, zucchini sticks, langosta bruschetta, and the bacon & date wrapped meatballs. The bruschetta was delicious and the portobello fries were my least favorite. The meatballs were my husbands favorite... i only had one small bite of it (he didn't SHARE!!) and it was very good. The zucchini sticks were good too but nothing compared to the uniquely flavored creamy bruschetta.  For our entree I had the shrimp po boy.... it came in a triangular shaped loaf filled to the brim with tempura fried shrimp, tangy spread and slaw. It was a great blend of flavors and well executed. My husband had the Philly cheesesteak and he could not stop raving about it.   When the bill came we felt like we had a steal of a deal. The service was on point. The food presentation was just as elegant as the location and it didn't break the bank. I know the restaurant is in it's honeymoon period but I hope it keeps up the good work.  The owners of Soyo and Oyshi have outdid themselves. The Sparklings is a great new addition to the southwest area. I'm actually having a fancy dinner with friends tonight and you'll never guess where we're going ---this cozy little place in my neighborhood.  p.s. 2nd time side note- my husband and I ordered the chicken parm and the spaghetti with mushroom & bacon cream sauce... not our favorites. Looks like the sandwiches and appetizers are the way to go---at least for now. :)",

Usually get an order of the Cajun shrimp and chicken pasta to go. Everything was so delicious! Love Oyshi, Soyo, and now this place. The decor feels so elegant and the location is very convenient. Have had a few birthday dinners here and this restaurant was an accommodating perfect setting. Staff is great and very helpful. The manager is engaging and really does his job well. Always a pleasure eating here! There are a few new dishes added to the menu and I can't wait to try!   Tried a few of the new dishes. Tried the smoke salmon crostini and the langosta bruschetta for appetizers. Both were pleasant. For the main courses I had BBQ baby back ribs and the basil sausage linguini. The meat on the ribs just fell off the bone, so tender. The basil linguini has great flavors, but also has a rich heavy cream kick that is dense. Was happy to see this place was packed! As always, a great dinning experience.",

I drove by our the other night to see some people in the bar and got excited to know that it was finally open.   My friend and I went there yesterday for some food. Starting with the service, it was good. Our water cups were always filled, and they checked in on us a lot. Although, at some points it was a bit incessant. But, if rather have over the top service than no service at all. Plus, we were the only table there for awhile. Our server, Deena, made things a bit awkward. There was just a lot of awkward silences, and it always seemed like she was whispering, but I can look past that.   As far as the food goes, it felt like there were more appetizers to choose from then there were entrees. Which, probably is a good thing because the appetizers we got were far better than the entrees.   We started with the Portobello fries and the crispy gnocchi. The fries were thick slices of Portobello that were lightly breaded then fried. They.served it with ranch, and some other sauce that I'm falling to remember. The crispy gnocchi had Italian sausage, pesto, peas, and walnuts. While it was good, unless you get a piece of sausage in every bite, the dish lacks a bit of salt.   For entrees, we offered the turkey and cranberry sandwich as well as the jambalaya. I don't know what o was expecting out of the turkey and cranberry sandwich, but I was just expecting more. While the cranberry sauce was good, they added quite a bit, so it overpowered everything else. Their version was a little more spruced up, with spinach and brie cheese. However, the cheese wasn't spread at all, just one slice in the middle. So, I only got one or two really good bites out of the sandwich. As far as the jambalaya, it was decent. Had good flavor, but just needed more. It war very mild tasting. Chicken was conned ti perfection though, so moist ! No sausage in the jambalaya thigh. :(   All in all, would I go back ? Probably. It's the closest place to eat next to my house. I'll probably stick with just ordering more appetizers next time though.",

However I would be remiss if I did not do a review on the amazing private party we had here a couple weeks ago.  I hosted a 60th Birthday/Retirement party here for approx 90 people. Andy, the owner, was amazing to work with and so be very accommodating answering texts, emails and working with me on the day of to ensure the space was everything I had planned it to be! The food turned out great and the staff was on top of all of my guests ensuring they had what they needed! My hats off to The Sparklings for helping to ensure this momentous occasion went off without a glitch! Thank you thank you thank you! Headed there tonight for dinner! :)",

    "text": "I don't know, maybe I came in on a off night.  I'm certainly willing to give them another try, but here is what I experienced on my visit.   On first impression, I love the decor and feel of the restaurant. They got that 100% right. However, there was something missing that I couldn't put my finger on...that night (Wednesday) it wasn't very busy so there was no hustle/bustle to give the place a warm vibe or maybe it was the sound system and how the music didn't really fill the room.  Not sure, but it felt like we were the last table in a restaurant that was about the close for the night. Just a little too quite.  I'd actually give the food 3/4 stars. It was decent. I think my favorite was the crispy gnocchi and would love to see that as a meal...it was darn good.   Where the night went wrong was partly due to the staff.  It wasn't that they were not friendly, they were, just inexperienced and their \"professionalism\" seemed forced, which if they are new to serving tables I understand it takes time to get your mo-jo going. Our appetizers came out on time and when I asked the person who delivered them (not our server) what type of bread came with the spinach and crab dip, as there were two different types served, his answer was, \"I don't know. I can ask the chef if you want\".  I feel like if you work at a restaurant and you are one of the people that brings food to the table, you should be well aware of the menu and what is on it. Maybe it was his first night on the job...who knows. At least he offered to ask the chef, I guess.   After the appetizers my soup came out and then shortly after he said our entrees would be out shortly.  They then delivered one entree followed by about a 10 minute wait...there was four of us in the party, so we were waiting on 3 more entrees.  They then delivered one more entree, still nothing on the other two, just apologies for the wait.  I even asked the waiter what was the hold up on the entrees, to which he answered \"I'm not sure, let me ask them\".  Hummm...we've been waiting now for 15 minutes + just to get out entrees served and you are apologizing, but you don't know why you are apologizing. When our entrees finally did come out the manager (I assume) finally gave us the reason...our steaks had been over cooked and they had to redo them.  Which, if they would have told us that right from the get go then I would have been understanding to the wait.  Also, while we were waiting during all of this the manager brought out a free appetizer, the spinach and crab dip, which we had already had.  It was a nice gesture, but also shows that there was no communication between the server and manager.  Why bring a table something they've already tried? Why not ask us what we would prefer considering we were the ones inconvenienced.   I hope it does improve and will go back another time over a weekend, perhaps to see if I can have a better experience.",

The place is beautifully decorated and comfortable. Our server, Tyler, was warm and friendly. We wanted to do a bunch of small plates and knew some of what we wanted to order (crispy gnocchi, diver scallops, Caesar salad, French onion soup) thanks to other yelpers' reviews, but Tyler was also happy to steer us in the right direction and spoke highly of the fish taco special. Everything was great. We also had the trio of desserts, some drinks and an espresso. Our bill for everything was $66 thanks to an insane 5-10pm happy hour special!! The whole evening was exactly what we were looking for. We would highly recommend it!",

The bar also has a great Moscow mule, which I highly recommend you get right away as you wait for your party to arrive or the rest of the table to determine what they want to eat.   To start, we ordered the scallops and bruschetta. Both were tasty.  However, I would say the scallops were a bit small from what I am used to. But, the price was fair. It is a decent amount to share between two people. I got the clam chowder. It is not the best, but not the worst. it was an okay bowl of chowder. The soup was creamy and had a decent amount of clams in it. However, nothing beats the chowder you get in San Francisco! But it was worth a taste.   My friend and I shared a pasta carbonara with the noodles cooked well and extra sauce on the side. It was a big plate that was more than enough to share. It was so big, we still had some leftover! The pasta was cooked well. The bacon on top was delicious. The sauce was creamy and rich like it should be. I recommend getting this for sure if you plan on going.   This is a classier place that is just off the strip. The drive is a bit far since it is deep in the southwest area of Las Vegas just 8 minutes before you actually hit Blue Diamond. The servers were nice, but it's hard to find a place that does not treat you well in Las Vegas.The drinks are reasonable for the type of dining experience. The seafood tasted fresh and was cooked well. The noise level was okay. When we went it was not busy at all, but I would still make a reservation, especially on the weekends.   Overall, I give the experience a four and will for sure come back again.",

Yes, I was part of the 6 person party that received horrible service from Susan last night.  Even a chain restaurant will \"pass off\" service if they are going on a break or no longer serving your table, but we were left to wonder where Susan had gone.  We were under the impression that Samantha was assisting her.  She was very nice, but seemed somewhat inexperienced to serve a table of 6.  We asked several times for our sever and Samantha said she was helping her.  Then after Samantha finally took our order, it was obvious that Susan had ditched us without a word.  I have been a server in many restaurants and I can't imagine treating my customers (especially, potentially tipping customers) in such a manner.    Andy, I read your responses to our party's concerns and you come off as rather defensive instead of sincerely sorry. You shouldn't tell your customers that they have no idea how to run a restaurant.  Not only is it condescending, but you also have NO idea if your assumption is True.  Two people in our party have owned and run restaurants.  I appreciate that you comp'd the scallops, and gave happy hour prices for the drinks, however that doesn't erase the experience and \"make us happy\" as you say it should.  I had been to your restaurant one time before and had a pleasant experience.  I think the food is delicious.  Service will make or break a restaurant though, so I hope you take our experience seriously.",

It's perfect for a date night, or just with a group of friends. It makes a perfect spot for birthday dinners too. Food comes well presented without being overpriced! That's what I always love!

    "text": "From the outside, I didn't expect the interior to look so classy- gorgeous namesake chandelier is the highlight of the dining room, bar area is quite nice as well. Decor reminds me of Alice in Wonderland with upscale-tea-party dishes and some garden figurines, some private seating areas available for groups.  Best for lunch or drinks and apps, rather than dinner IMO. Almost didn't order the CRISPY GNOCCHI because I'm not a fan of that pasta in general, but the positive reviews persuaded me and the pesto sauce won me over: good combination of flavors and textures in this dish. PORTOBELLO FRIES are simple and tasty with two dipping sauces, GRILLED OCTOPUS is perfectly charred but would prefer an even portion to the set of three received, hard to share. SEARED DIVER SCALLOPS are delightful, but deceptively plated with crispy rice cakes that look like additional scallops. The lemon beurre blanc is the perfect sauce for this dish. Steer clear of the LOBSTER BRUSCHETTA though- recommended by our server, this dish was a disaster that put me off finishing my meal. Menu describes it as lobster, avocado, and mango (neither of which we even detected), in a cream-cheese aioli, on toasts. It reminded me of a really bad country club's version of seafood salad. Pairing seafood with cheese is tricky, this dish does not do it well.  Good wine and cocktail selection, the Justin Cab or the two sparkling by-the-glass options are solid, but frankly I'm baffled as to why the menu has so few glass options in the first place. Service was polite and attentive, love the variety of seating options.",

    "text": "Thank you to my fellow Yelpers for reccomending this place. It's great to go on a romantic date, has great dim lighting, beautiful chandelier in the center of the room, makes you feel like if you were in somebody's house.  I wanted to try everything so we mainly got appetizers and one entree. We ordered Lobster bisque, which came with onion crisps and a dollop sour cream, which honestly i think the lobster bisque was fine by itself and didnt need all those extras. My favorite part about the calamari was the marinara sauce. Truffle fries were great but i did think the garlic chunks were kind of big. I couldn't get enough of the Clam Linguini with a light cream sauce, that was definitely my favorite dish.  The drink i ordered was the Cumcumber Frenh, a mix of gin, champagne and cucumber juice, very refreshing.  I definitely would recomend this place to anyone but please make sure you know u are going into a romantic setting, so you can be aware and prepared to look nice for your date.",

Bottomless mimosas were on revolve! The decor is cute but I feel like the restaurant is so new overall that all of the kinks aren't quite worked out yet. Servers were so sweet and apologetic for a few things that went awry but the food and drinks are definitely worth the patience. Go into the bathroom and be instantly transported into an 80s time warp like Willy Wanka where the room gets smaller and seemingly smaller because of the walls. Can't wait to come back here!!!",

After waiting for the table to be set, there was no champagne for mimosas during brunch. We were told they would not be able to make arrangements to get champagne for our party, and if we decided to get our own champagne that they would charge us a $35 cork fee! The server spilled water on the favors, the restaurant wasn't busy but the service was slow and all over the place, the bathroom was unkept and the food was just ok. But, they did allow everyone have separate checks! Could've been an isolated incident but I'd suggest dining at your own risk. One guest's order came out wrong and the manager had the server bring it back and told her to try it anyway. That was so crazy I couldn't do anything but laugh. Not once did the manager step out to greet or check in with us. Thanks but no thanks Sparklings. Thank God we had a good group of girls for my mothers birthday celebration that we made the best of a bad situation!",

    "text": "\"What lies behind us and what lies before us are tiny matters compared to what SPARKLES within us\"  - Ralph Waldo Emerson (Paraphrased)   The Sparklings boasts a unique and aesthetically pleasing interior, complete with a large chandelier that sparkles like a cheesy vampire in the sun. As others have noted, this interior is delightful, but also is one of the better things they have going. If the owners (also see Soyo and Oyshi) were hoping that The Sparklings would be the crown jewel to their south Rainbow eateries, they severely missed the mark here. The food looks great on the menu but doesn't shine in execution.    If you find yourself sitting in The Sparklings and want to make the most of it try the Brown Butter Gnocchi or one of their seafood based pastas (Note: the Spicy Seafood Pasta was not very spicy.) You could also go with the Rice Au Gratin with Chicken or the Grapes Basil and Ricotta Flat Bread.  Then again, you could also go down the street 2,000 feet to Soyo for better food sans the delightful ambiance.   It's not that the food is generally bad; it is simply average and not special in any way.  Happy Hour looks like the way to go as well if you're planning on coming in.  Do come here with a large group of people that don't appreciate elevated food. The setting would be wonderful for a group outing, adult birthday, or the like.",

    "text": "I hope the owner reads the good reviews too, and not just the bad ones lol. I don't understand why this place isn't busier. I've only eaten here once, but my fiance and I frequent the pho restaurant next door and the parking lot seems to always be empty here..  Myself, my fiance, and a friend strolled in around 5pm one a weekday and were literally the only people in the place. (At first I thought they were only open for dinner and had just opened, but then noticed they are actually open for lunch as well.)  We sat in the dining room, which is beautiful!! Very classy and inviting. Our server (who was also the bartender) was very attentive and accommodating. After we came in, she had 5 other tables consecutively come in (sitting in the dining room and bar area) and she handled it beautifully, without neglecting us in the process. I'm a bartender also, and for her to handle all that on her own without being in the weeds is pretty impressive. Especially since there was no food runner.   Our friend ordered ribs with mashed potatoes, corn bread (I think) and veggies. Fiance had spicy seafood pasta. They both loved what they had.   I love this place because the menu is huge!! I'm a vegetarian, so I'm used to maybe having 3 options to choose from, one of which is a salad, and the other two being a meat dish that I have to modify. Not the case here!! SOOO many options it was hard to decide. I went with the cucumber salad and a vegetable quesadilla without the tortilla. Salad was fresh and delicious. Since I ordered the veggie quesadilla without the tortilla, I just expected a bowl of vegetables with some shredded cheese thrown in (which would have been fine), but the chef loaded it with cheese, I guarantee gave me more veggies than would have come in it the regular way, and baked the whole dish. It was AMAZING. The fact that it was automatically made that way without me asking was even better. And... IT'S CHEAP!! You wouldn't guess it based on the decor, but it is very reasonably priced. We live down the street and will DEFINITELY be returning to try more stuff. I have recommended it to all my industry people to hopefully get them some more business!",

They're open very late too! (2AM on weekdays and 3AM on weekends!). Don't let the outside esthetic fool either! It's BEAUTIFUL in the inside! The decor is a little luxurious with a quaint country home style. The chandeliers and  flowers are my favorite. I also love the furniture and cabinetry.   Anyway on to the food and drinks. My best friend and I visited on quiet weekday. We order a bottle of their Riesling, crispy gnocchi, prime rib-eye, creme brulee, and chocolate cake. Loved everything except the chocolate cake. It was FAR TOO RICH AND SWEET for my palette, but I'm sure many love it that way. It was not the traditional sense of cake either. Just straight hard, rich flour less chocolate. No cake whatsoever. I like sweet desserts, but this was too much. I'll stick with the creme brulee in the future.   I will definitely be returning again and again! I want to tell everyone about this place, but a small part of me wants to keep this little gem a secret. However since there is very few patrons that I have seen, I don't want to risk them suffering from lack of business. Therefore, I hope more people visit, but of course I hope it doesn't become over saturated and cliche like many popular restaurants on the strip. Good thing this establishment isn't on the strip for vultures to ruin it!  So if you're  sensible and will appreciate a delicious meal in a beautiful quiet setting with superb service, RUN to this place quick! Get the enjoyment of exclusivity now before everyone finds out about this best kept secret gem in the south!",

There were 6 of them, 3 of them being normal scallops but the other 3 had sweet rice in them; it was so different I loved them.  Our meals arrived shortly after finishing the scallops. I ordered the Jambalaya and my friend ordered the spicy seafood pasta. They were both filling yet super flavorful. I loved them both.   The Creme brulee was just blissful. It was just perfect.

    "text": "A somewhat strange, but overall intriguing restaurant.  Environment: Personally, I find the environment and ambience of this restaurant particularly strange. The exterior is fashioned to look somewhat like a lodge, while the interior could not be any more different. The floorplan is very open, with some strange booth areas in the back as well as a somewhat separate bar/lounge area. However, the whole interior seems to be modeled to look kind of like a big living room or lobby, with the tables placed in the center of the open area. Overall, while the interior decorating does seem a little strange it is oddly inviting, and offers ample place for larger groups to have room without bothering smaller parties.  Food: The food style is American fusion with some European and Asian influences. Their menu is surprisingly extensive, and I was pleasantly surprised when I went in for brunch and we were also allowed to order from the regular and dinner menus. From the brunch menu, the short rib hash was delicious, despite the hollandaise which I typically do not like, but with this dish it fit perfectly. Additionally, we tried the tuna tartare which was very fresh and came mixed with cubes of mango which was very refreshing, baby octopus (which was one of my favorites), as well as the Brussel sprouts. Additionally, the bottomless mimosas are a great deal, as they leave the pitcher with you so that you are never waiting for a refill, and the champagne to OJ ratio is very generous, so you do not feel like you are simply drinking juice.  Service: Being a smaller restaurant, they seemed somewhat understaffed, however despite how busy they were I felt like our server was really trying her best and was very accommodating, being sure to refill our mimosa pitcher, waters, and repeatedly checking in to make sure we had everything that we needed.",

Very poor service they ignored us when we tried to flag them down and they were not very busy so we don't know why they were ignoring us.  The food quality was mediocre at best  I originally tried this restaurant because of all the good reviews but I would assume those reviews were made by friends and family and employees because they were very inaccurate reviews.  To top things off they overcharged us on our bill for items that we never ordered and for drinks that we never had and then blamed it on the computer when we asked them about it. This is a what The waiter said \" The computer does that all the time sorry\"",

The decor and vibe is inviting and endearing. It has a colorful, urban and rustic feel. The food is GOOOOD (I recommend the brussel sprouts..they will actually make you LOVE brussel sprouts)  I threw a party here on October 24. The owner, Andy made this a super easy going experience. He gave me a bit of freedom (within reason) to make the party my own. Including choosing my own music. I was able to request MY FAVORITE BARTENDER, ANGEL. And him and Ray were ON IT. I had about 45 guests and the service was quick, friendly and incredible. All of my guests were happy with the evening and commented on how adorable the venue was. I really can't thank Andy, Ray and the super attentive server/host (forgot his name, sorry!) enough for their help making the party such a success. And especially to Angel for ALWAYS making me feel like a star when I come into The Sparklings...by greeting me as soon as I walk in, and remembering my name and favorite drink!",

The taste and texture of the green beans were like the frozen kind of green beans you get in the freezer section of the grocery store. If it's not the frozen kind, then the \"fresh\" green bean was off that night. The overall dish was mediocre. Nothing too special about it. Definitely not worth the $29 I paid per plate.

I've been here once before, years ago with Hunnie Bunnie, which was also pre-vegan life.  So this time was different. I did take a look at their menu online before deciding on this place though and they have a veggie sandwich on the menu. I inquired if the bread was vegan (it is), hold the cheese and no sauces (not sure if any come on there anyway, but I got it dry). And it was good! Abuelita also got a veggie sandwich but she left the cheese on hers, and we both indulged in bottomless mimoas. They bring over little carafes for you so you can refill your own glass and when that's empty, they bring you ANOTHER ONE.  We were literally there ALL DAY. After our looooong brunch, we moved into the bar area and ordered a lovely bottle of Justin Cabernet... and when I got the bill... Turns out it was on HAPPY HOUR! Total SCORE.  Our server was great and attentive and I will definitely be back!",

The food was still top notch but the service was awful.  We were promptly sat in the main area and the guy who sat us started us with waters.  Then we sat and waited for over 10 minutes and a server came over and asked if we had been taken care of and we said no and he said he would.  We then ordered our meal and there was another substantial delay.  My tuna tartar came out first and then nothing for a while then my dads app the fish tacos came out then nothing.  I made eye contact with the manager as he probably saw me looking around and that is when all of our food came out.  While all of the food was great, the service didn't compare to what it has been before.  Not to mention the manager clearly could tell I was impatient and while he intervened to deliver our meal he didn't apologize for the obvious delay.  The bathrooms definitely need some attention.  They were out of paper towels and the toilet didn't flush easily. We could even hear other guests complaining at the host stand to the manager about the bathroom being sub par.    We were then forgotten about again and as my family was tired we went up to the host stand ourself to pay our bill.  This place has the food down to a tee but if they don't turn their guest experience around ASAP I can't see anything good for the future.  I truly hope this was a one off.",

    "text": "Just searched brunch in spring valley and this place popped up. From the reviews it seemed pretty awesome.  Walked in but no one was at the host counter.  Waited a long while, and finally a waiter came over and sat us. No big, wasn't very busy but there was a really large party. We sat and got drinks and ordered pretty quickly from there. Then, the wait. I believe we waited around 30-40 minutes for the food to come. They did apologize for the wait and said the kitchen was behind due to the large group, which I get. But that was also like 30 minutes into waiting for the food to come. About 10-15 minutes later, our food arrived. I ordered chicken fried steak from the brunch menu, and my partner ordered a shrimp poor boy sandwich and a side of corn bread.  The chicken fried steak had burnt edges on one side, the other side was fine. It was pretty tough itself. The biscuits underneath it were pretty hockey pucks - seriously hard to cut through with the butter knife provided.  Super chewy too. Flavor was fine though. Then the gravy....it was alright, nothing special, not super creamy either for country gravy. It also had that look of having been sitting out a while too, the gravy had settled and had that plastic sheen dried on top of it.  Whole thing was barely still warm. Definitely a kitchen timing issue after having to get out the meals for the giant group. The shrimp poor boy was alright, nothing special but not bad either. The highlight of the meal was the cornbread actually. It was good, even without butter (it doesn't come with any, so ask I guess if you like to put some on your bread). Really disappointed with the food. =\\  All in all, it's a pretty restaurant that's decorated nicely and the waiter was fine, but the wait and cold/burnt food with the rubber biscuit puck was just....not very good. =\\ Menu really sounds great too, I would have liked to try some other things, but I probably wouldn't go back.",

We were seated quickly enough, but then waited about 10 minutes for anyone to even bring water. There were only about 4 tables with patrons, and only one that hadn't been served yet. It took about 10 more minutes for the actual waiter to come by, his only words are \"Do you know what you want?\" Didn't ask us if we wanted anything else to drink and didn't go over the specials, soups, etc. which apparently there was, because a table that came in after us and sat close by, their waiter was happy to tell them about it. Needless to say totally unacceptable wait staff behavior. I've had better at McDonald's.  As for the meals, we ordered the spaghetti with mushrooms and chicken and cream sauce (terrible - it was like they just poured cream over the top no flavor at all, and not much mushrooms or chicken, no herbs or spices whatsoever), and two orders of the seasonal cheese and spinach ravioli with vodka sauce which while hot when it came out, the vodka sauce tasted like a cheap jarred version you'd get a grocery store. And there are no salt and pepper shakers on the table!  We came here based on the amount of high star reviews here on Yelp, but based on my experience I have no idea why could possibly be that high. I am quite certain here in Las Vegas you can find much much better (and I have since this night!)",

Not just a complete fail, but something that doesn't even resemble the classic dish. Every meal we had was missing something. Chinese salad, was not very Chinese. Eggs Benedict was a betrayal on the original. Meatball appetizer was so salty and fried so hard as not to be edible. Skip this place until real cooks take back the kitchen.",

Seems like it's always pretty quiet in there but I don't know why it should be packed! I would highly recommend making a visit to The Sparklings you won't regret the decision! Two orders of gnocchi to go please lol!",

    "text": "What a hidden little gem!  I had never heard of this place until a friend invited us to a bday brunch here. Definitely good for large parties as the seating area is spacious and open. It's also really pretty with a gorgeous chandelier in the middle, fresh floral arrangements, and  modern decor mixed with cool little attention to detail type things.   Seemed pretty empty in the restaurant for a Sunday at 12 but I'm assuming people don't know it's open for brunch. The dining area is big though and the tables are pretty separated from one another so even with our large party and the restaurant starting to fill up, it still seems mellow and quiet.   The prices are reasonable and the brunch menu options were good. They also have bottomless mimosas for 18. I had a simple item as I was heading to a BBQ after but once everyone else's food came, I was really impressed. The food looked great. The regular menu looked great and we can't wait to come back and try some of those items.   I'd say the service was definitely slow which seemed weird bc the restaurant was not busy at alll but once my food came, I didn't really care Bc it was great and the overall experience was nice. Would definitely come back.",

    "text": "Aghhhh, I so badly want to like this place but I just can't seem to find a dish I love...and I've been here at least four times. This last time I came is what drove me to disappointment. It never seems busy in there yet service is a bit slow -- although I don't like to dwell on the quickness of the service cus that can't always be helped. But if there are only three parties at the restaurant, you'd think the staff would be checking the food rather just standing at the front lollygagging or looking unhappy to be there.  I ordered the langosta bruschetta which was okay. I liked the cream cheese aioli and lobster mix and the bruschetta was crispy. But I don't think I'd order it again.   My mother ordered the clam chowder because that's the main reason we came, she was craving it. It tasted very plain. By the looks of the restaurant (and price of the clam chowder) you'd think it'd be a little more hearty and flavorful. It wasn't.   The thing that set me off was my truffle parmesan fries. I looked at the menu at least three times to make sure that \"weird dollop of garlic\" was supposed to be in the description. It wasn't. I wanted truffle parmesan fries, not soggy garlic fries. I could barely taste the truffle with all the garlic overpowering it. Maybe if the fries were actually crispy, it might have been decent, but it was way too soggy. Because I paid $6 for it, I tried to finish it but I could barely do it with the strong garlic flavor. I was so disappointed.   Aside from the food, the decor and the restaurant itself is very pretty. But I don't think I'll be coming back on my own will.",

Decided to wait for the staff to notice that they have possible customers waiting.

No one acknowledged us and we left after about 15 minutes of waiting. Absolutely unacceptable service.",

We met the rest of the staff and they were all nice too.  Recently this restaurant went downhill with the staff, they got rid of Angel which made this bar. Thankfully Rey is still there!!  The food quality has gone down and the service as well. You walk in and its a sad atmosphere, the bar empty and the music lets not even get started on that. This was a place you could hang with friends and even family recommended a bunch of people but now would i recommend this place, not at all!!  sparklings it was nice having found you when you were an incredible place.

I admit that it was close to 1am which is an hour before they close at 2am....and we waited for about 5 minute before we were seated since the bartender was going to wait on us. That was a little odd to me... But oh well.  Service was 2/5... We were the only patrons in the restaurant area and we seemed to be a nuisance to them since they seemed to be having a ball in the bar area. But i didn't feel like drinking...i wanted to eat since I had just gotten off of a 14 hour shift and was starving. And if dining this late was not what they wanted to do they should not keep the restaurant open. They should just keep the bar open. I would have given 1 star but the busser was great so I have an extra star for his service.   The food was...I have no other words... But the food was horrible. Brussel sprouts...I normally love them... And I did eat all of it...As read above I just got off a 14 hour shift and was starving. So I ate it... But it was so burnt and bitter. Blah then the sheperd's pie... Was cold. The mixture inside was soupy instead of a creamy meaty filling. They did have a little bit of mashed potatoes on it underneath the puff pastry.. But that was cold as well...I would have complained but the attitude of the server was as such that I did not want to waste my time saying anything.   Maybe if I had come at a different time, the service and the food would have been better. Who knows? I see that other people had better service and food then I did. But with the food that I tasted and the service that I received will not have me rushing back which is a shame since they are just down the street from me.",

But as far as water refills were concerned, they were on top of it and we also ordered a bottle of wine that was refilled for us promptly.   So! Here are the good things:   LOTS of different options and variety. It is a little mix of modern American and Italian. Between the three of us we ordered:  Caprese Salad Crispy Gnocchi  Shrimp Po Boy  Fish Tacos  Beet and Apple Salad  All of which were excellent and had no issues. You can tell the ingredients are fresh and delicious. The price was less than $10 for each dish which was great. Keep in mind that these items are all \"appetizer\" size compared to other restaurants.   Anywho, I am all for supporting local businesses that aren't a chain. Definitely give this place a shot.

The French toast is amazing, the tomato basil soup is so delicious but my favorite is the seafood ravioli! They provide different sauce options for it and it's so creamy and good! I love Sparklings I'll definitely go back a million times more.",

You would never expect the inside to look the way it does & I love moments like that.   We opted for the bar tonight because it was calling our name & felt very casual. The bartender was awesome & hooked up the liquor which made everything else better. They have so many great drinks on the menu & everything tastes like candy.  The food was excellent & we decided on a few smaller plates so we could taste a few different things. We ended up with a great Caesar salad, the crispy gnocchi that were phenomenal, the bacon & date meatballs (my favorite item) & then the decadent bacon & mushroom cream spaghetti which can't be described well enough by me. It was a really great meal that was very casual & memorable.   Great menu, service & beautiful decor.",

He is completely unprofessional, and if you say something he does not like he bashes you on here. How brave :)  He wanted to state that most of my reviews on yelp were 0 stars but that's not True. I even complimented the decor of this establishment in my review... but I guess that isn't good enough. He even states I am an \"unhappy person?\" how would he know that by me visiting his restaurant? - oh wait, he got one thing correct - I wasn't happy that i spent $200 and got slow service, had a bar tender as a waiter (who was also rude and kept calling me Bebe, Sugar etc. I don't need to be called pet names by anyone, like many of people have stated on here) had to step on threw up on the bathroom floor and had to deal with a male walking into a the lady's restroom. So I guess he is correct- I am unhappy. Unhappy with the service I got! Finally this guy got something right! (Yay!) Any other business owner would in fact look into this and have the business sense to reply in a professional manner. As threw up all over the bathroom floor (health hazard) the waiter who thinks its okay to call women by pet names (sexual harassment much?) and a male walking into the lady's room is quite serious. If you ask me - this guy is the one who is unhappy.  But then again, I would be unhappy too if I got a comments like this. - But heck yea! I will stay away! And I will make sure others do as well. No one deserves this AT ALL.",

Since southwest area of Las Vegas is becoming very big attraction for local residents, there are a lot of great restaurant in southwest including The Sparklings. Also, there are many house and apartment communities, which they can target for many regular customers  Parking There are many parking spots available for Sparklings customers. It is not a parking space that Sparkling individually own, but shares the spot with other business that located in the same complex.  Interior The Sparklings has great interior design. It looks like they have the real Italian theme interior design that makes a customer to feel the real Italian cuisine. It is very vintage and rustic, but also modern in some ways. Restaurant has many seats and tables available for the customers. Also, Sparklings has individual party room and many booth areas for big party of people. Sparklings are divided into two parts, which is a bar area and dining area. Customers can have their drink and enjoy time with bartenders in the bar area, and other customers can enjoy their meal in clean dining room.  Kitchen Kitchen is located in the back of the restaurant. It is not open kitchen, only thing I can see was that whenever the food was ready, chef ring the bell and server goes in to grab and give to the customers.  Customer Service Employees seem very professional in the restaurant. Servers wore black pants and black shirt with green apron. Bartenders wore black pants and black shirts with black vest. Servers are always moving around, checking on customers' plates and all ready to answer every question for the customers. Bartenders seem very friendly. They were very outgoing that wants to have a conversation with customers.  Food (Spicy seafood pasta) Sight: Served with very clean white bowl and silver wear. Also, pasta seemed very well cooked and seafood seems fresh. Aroma: Aroma of pasta was spicy and pungent smell Taste / Flavor: Taste was spicy and bit of saltiness behind. The Flavor was very rich mixed with seafood and other spices. Texture: The pasta was soft and seafoods were chewy. Texture was nothing like I was eating seafood that was thawed.   Overall, I highly recommend to try out this place since the price and quality of their service and food balanced really well!",

Today we had our own room/area since we were a party of 6.  The servers were very nice and the service was fast.  It was pretty busy today since there was an event happening, but they were on top of it!  I had the lobster bisque, spicy seafood pasta, and creme brulee.   Good lobster bisque is hard to find.  The lobster bisque here was on point.  Tortilla chips and sour cream (optional) made it better.    The spicy seafood  pasta was just as advertised: SPICY.  This has a generous amount and array of seafood such as mussels, clams, scallops, squid, and shrimp.  I would get this again!  The vanilla creme brulee was fantastic too!  It's big enough to share with 2 people.  I really enjoyed the food and ambiance here.  I would recommend this place for special occasions.",

The person I was dining with had a calamari and pasta that also looked lovely.    This restaurant seems like a nice date spot off the beaten path that will neither break the bank or underwhelm.  It looked like a very niche place that I would bring people on a regular basis.  I recommend the Sparklings regularly as many would never know it existed based on its locale.",

    "text": "When we walked in to a half empty restaurant, there was no host at the front, so we waited about 10 minutes for a waiter to finally seat us. We were excited about the decor in the dining room. They gave use a table in a nice secluded area with a bench seat on one side and overly large comfortable seats on the other. The menu looked impressive with very reasonable prices. I couldn't believe it wasn't packed with people. The waiter was very friendly. We placed our order for drinks, appetizers and entrees.  When my wife went to pick up the menu, there was a bug on the table under the menu. She jumped from her seat. The waiter looked for the bug under the table. I used the light on my phone, and we found and killed it. Ok. Everything ok. Let's get back to dinner. About 2 minutes later, my youngest jumped out of her seat and said there was a bug on her leg. I looked on her seat, and the bug was running around on the cushion (see picture). Who I think was the owner (tall Asian guy) came over to talk to the waiter. The waiter moved us to another table. We decided to stay because it wasn't roaches, and it was too late to find another place to eat as the kids were hungry.  Out comes one of the appetizers - bacon/date meatballs. As we took our first bite of the meatballs, out comes my wife's ribeye entree order. The owner comes over and asks how's everything. I said the entree is a bit early. He says, \"Oh, I will try to get the other entrees out faster.\"  What?  How about giving us time to eat the appetizers first. Then the next appetizer comes out - the octopus. Then the kids baby back ribs. Finally my chicken parmigiana. So all entrees were on the table before we even finished our appetizers. Geez. Not a huge issue for us because the apps were a couple of bites each, but why doesn't the owner or waiter know how to time the food coming out???  Also, the owner never even apologized about the bugs.  Now the food (see pictures). My chicken parmigiana came with spaghetti. The spaghetti was cooked right al debate and sauce tastes good. The chicken had a weird texture. I flipped it over and noticed that it looked like chicken had either panini grill or George Foreman grill marks. It was not a breaded chicken breast. Chicken parm is my favorite dish, and they do not do it justice. The chicken filet itself tasted liked a previously frozen breast that gets injected with solution kind of like a breast from one of those family sized bags of frozen breasts you find at Costco.  My wife got a rib-eye steak and ordered it medium. Although it came out earlier than any other entree, it was well done. It also had a strange color to it. Although there were grill marks, it did not have any kind of crusting like a char-broiled or flame-broiled steak. It looks like they put it on a grill pan but there was too much liquid in the pan causing a boiling of the meat instead of a sear. We waited for about 15 minted before we even saw the waiter again, and told him about the steak. He apologized and went back to get another steak. My wife ate what should could but about 50% of the steak was fat (see picture). Yes the rib-eye looks like a large portion when it comes out, but you can't eat most of it.  Two of the kids split the ribs. It came with cornbread and mashed potatoes. The cornbread was extremely dry and tasteless. My kids love cornbread, and we each only tasted a small bite to see how bad it really was. Although the ribs were fall off the bone, they still tastes dry to me. The bbq sauce on the ribs was overpowering and not very good.  My other kid ordered the kid's menu fish and chips. Typical crap food on a kids menu using a frozen fish filet that's deep fried. Kid's meal comes with a drink, but apparently the waiter doesn't know that because he tried to charge me for the drink.  In the end, I think the bugs were trying to warn us to get out of there. They even sent two, so we would get the point. I wish we walked out after the second warning. I was so disappointed as we were hoping this could be a cool place to stop whenever we are in Vegas. My kids didn't even want to stay for dessert. At one point we were looking for our waiter. I noticed he was near the bar talking to someone.  He was there for about five minutes. Next thing you know he is doing shots with the guy. Then instead of checking on his tables, he wanders in to the back for another 10 mins. The owner never checked on us again even though he passed our table about 10 times when he went to/from the kitchen.   Bottom line - the food pretty much sucks, the service sucks, the owner doesn't care. It is reflected in the food they serve, the service they provide, and the apathy they display.   As we left the restaurant, you would think someone would give a final word of apology. The owner was too busy in the bar area BSing. Bill $103. No comp for the horrible experience, and overcharged for a soda. No wonder it was pretty empty on a Friday night. One star for ambiance.",

Very decently priced and the food was delicious. Our party ordered the crab and spinach dip and the calamari for appetizers. The steak Diane plate. Pan seared salmon, and the ribeye. We left no crumbs behind! The service wasn't bad either, it didn't feel like they were rushing us to turn tables, as normal restaurants do. We were able to enjoy our time. Definitely will be back.",

The restaurant boasts an interesting menu with a wide variety of choices for the epicurean connoisseur, while also appeasing those who prefer a more basic plate.  We visited twice since finding this hidden gem, and both times the food was fantastic, fresh, and flavorful. The staff was very attentive and helped to explain some of the more unique dishes on their menu.   Go here, eat things, you are going to love it.",

We started with appetizers of meatballs wrapped in bacon and crunchy gnocchi, both delicious and unique. For entrees there was spaghetti with bacon served with chicken, a Philly cheesesteak sandwich and brie with turkey, again spot-on and flavorful. The location interior was a bit quirky, but in a compelling way-a cross between factory loft and grand ballroom. You'll see what I mean when you go inside. Server was attentive and friendly, owner came by to see about our experience, this restaurant is worth a try!",

Only thing bad was it was it was too big (for me), so it made me kind of full before dinner. I had the cajun chicken and shrimp pasta. It was so good. Creamy, lots of different colored bell peppers. I didnt drink wine that night, but I looked over the selection and they had a nice variety of everything. Our server was great. Jason I think his name was? My only thing was I couldn't quite pin point the atmosphere.  It's nice, but like trying to hard to be upscale. The music was very jazzy and at times elevator music. I think if the music was a little more upbeat and the lights lowered a bit, it would change the atmosphere drastically. Overall great food... great prices for the excellent dishes they offered.",

Not very casual actually, I'd say for the female, a casual dress or a nice blouse and for the gentleman jeans and a nice shirt. Besides the place, the food was astounding!! For appetizers, we had the brown butter gnocchi (I believe) crisp on the outside, soft and chewy inside (maybe enough for 2 but we all got a taste) . Delicious. We ordered the cheese platter. Amazing. I'm sorry I don't remember exactly what it's called on the menu. I had the pesto pasta (I forgot exactly what it was called but I'm pretty sure it was the only pesto dish). It was excellent creamy pesto sauce in linguine with Italian sausage, peas and pine nuts. The others ordered ribs, other pastas, rotisserie chicken, BLT's... Everything was amazing and impressive. They do an excellent job in presentation. AND THE PORTIONS. Don't get me started! Such generous portions almost everyone went home with leftovers. The place is perfect for a date or even a birthday party (all ages) they offer a nice private room if you want to reserve for a party, but I went with almost 10 people, a long booth was perfect for us. The service is great too, excellent young men that work there. BEST PART: The prices are unbelievably reasonable, for the large portions and quality food. Good for kids, (well behaved).",

    "text": "Stopped into this place since a few friends wanted to try it out. Boy I should have suggested somewhere else! Not a good place to eat at all. And it seems that the place does not know what type of decor it should be going for as none of it matched. They didn't stick with 1 design but had several that were completely mismatched.   On to the food. Tried 3 of the items off the menu. First off was a Flat bread pizza & I cannot remember the price of it but whatever it was - not worth it. It was completely soggy in the middle & just no taste to it at all. My friend ordered that & I tried a piece of it but - gross.   Truffle Parmesan Fries \"sea salt, parsley, lemon garlic sauce\" ($6) - It came with one dipping sauce which was just mayonnaise (seriously?) & the chunks of garlic were falling off but there there really was no taste to the fries whatsoever & they were not crispy. They weren't even salted. Since they were cool when we tried to add salt to them it would not stick. I've had Truffle fries at other venues & they at least have the truffle sauce on them - there was nothing present on these fries. Would not ever order them again.   I ordered the Crispy Gnocchi \"creamy pesto, Italian sausage, peas, crushed candied walnuts\" ($7.50) because it sounded so excellent & after the complete let down of the other two food items I was still hungry. It seems that they forgot to put the order in as I had to ask them for it after sitting for 30 minutes & not receiving it but others that ordered food after me were getting their food. Finally when it did arrive I was grateful as I was starving after not have hardly eaten anything all day. I do have to say that this dish as great. I really loved it. Wished the portion would have been larger in fact.   Service was good in the beginning of the evening as the bar area was not that full. But as the night went on we constantly had to flag bartenders down. Bartenders left our food dishes that we clearly were not eating from sit in front of us for over 45 minutes. At that point I placed them on the rail of the bar so they would take them. I would think that it would be common sense if you see plates that have most of the food still on them that you would ask if everything was ok or if you liked your food - nope finally took plates away with most of the food on them after I had to move them onto the rail where they make drinks without a peep if all was ok. After paying our bill we were still finishing our drinks & never once did the bar tenders ask if we needed anything else even when our drink glasses went empty & we were still there talking. Didn't even ask if we wanted another drink or a glass of water. In fact they were actually ignoring us & wouldn't even look at us or come to the place on the bar we were sitting.   How this place has 4.5 stars is completely beyond me. I think it has to be the employees/owners/their friends writing the reviews to bump it up that high. The Crispy Gnocchi is what is saving them from getting zero stars (although I realize yelp doesn't allow zero). The other food & service gives them a zero. Even though the Crispy Gnocchi was great I won't be going back to this place. Not worth the drive even if it is close to my work.",

There was about 13 of us for a birthday. All of our food came out at completely different times, so some people in our party were almost done eating by the time others were just getting their food. We had to ask for basic things like silverware. One of our people arrived late and nobody asked her if she wanted anything to drink or gave her a menu. Members of our party had to request all of these things for her. We also asked to add another table because we were seated very close together and they refused to add one, even though there were plenty empty tables.   Now the food. Some of the food was great! The appetizers were tasty. The main dishes, however, were not. My friends \"roasted\" chicken looked like an under-boiled nasty mess. He asked for some Tabasco and was told that the food should already be spicy enough.....another friend ordered truffle fries and never got them and later had to have the server take the charge off the bill. My husband's chicken risotto wasn't good either.  Overall, it seems that this place spent more effort on decor than they did training their staff on service and cooking.  We all have experience working in customer service and are a very easy bunch to please. It's safe to say nobody in our party will be returning.",

Not the most welcoming environment!!! I won't be going back!!!!",

    "text": "This is a late appreciation review, but it's a must. The night before my graduation from UNLV, I was worried about a place to take my family (who flew in from Guam) for dinner that was both fitting for a graduation night & welcome to Vegas. Sparklings obviously came to mind. Even though it was last minute, they fit me in. Unfortunately there was no seating inside (already reserved for graduates who are not procrastinators), but the seating out on the patio was great. The awning made it cool, the lights made it cute, the privacy made it personal, & the food and service was just the cherry on top. Everything we ate was flavorful and rich, without being overbearing. Zucchini sticks, roasted beet & apple salad, and Cajun chicken and shrimp pasta were my favorites!",

    "text": "This place is out of this world! First off, the vibes and the feel of this place are instantly elegant and chic! From the pink roses to the beautiful chandelier, this place was definitely made for a romantic experience. Don't let the outside fool you! It looks like any other restaurant surrounding it.   I ordered a raspberry lemon drop and my boyfriend ordered the bourbon mule. Let me just say, my martini was made with fresh muddled raspberries and tasted perfect. The equal parts alcohol and equal parts raspberries and pink sugar around the glass rim were on point.   We ordered the spaghetti with meat sauce and the chicken parmesan. Both were extremely delicious! I highly recommend both dishes. Each meal was enough food for 2 people. They didn't serve only Italian. The menu ranges from different cuts of meat and fish, cheeses, pastas and soups.   Definitely excited to come back to this local place! For being off the strip, fairly priced and one of the best meals I have had in a while this place is definitely going on the top of my list.",

Restaurant was about half full, making me skeptical about our upcoming experience.  Fortunately we were patient, and service improved after that.  I ordered crispy gnocchi to start, and had the stuffed bell pepper appetizer as my meal.  Hubs got Caesar salad and spaghetti with meatballs.  Food tasted great, and we both found other dishes on the menu that we wanted to try.    Noticed the outdoor seating area as we left, will have to try that before it gets too hot outside as well.  Can't wait to try some of the other dishes - plus 20% off alcohol in the restaurant on Sunday and Monday, and happy hour in the bar EVERY NIGHT 5-10 pm!",

    "text": "The Sparklings is one of the newer restaurants to have opened in the southwest area, courtesy of the owners of Soyo and Oyshi, which are just down the road.  Walking in, it's hard to not be impressed with the dramatic transformation this space has taken.  I almost felt a bit under dressed with the ornate chandelier dominating the open eating area and a bit concerned pushing my stroller in with a crying baby inside. We had our choice of seating and opted for a corner spot to minimize any distractions.  (I noticed the generous amount of high chairs available, which to me encourages a family-friendly restaurant.)  With a quick glance at the menu, we ended up just ordering appetizers.  * Crispy Gnocchi \"creamy pesto, Italian sausage, peas, crushed candied walnuts\" ($7.50) - This was good, worthy of making this a meal by ordering two. (Update! I actually did this the following week and it was too much for one person. It's pretty rich, and two orders to yourself is quite a bit. And my gnocchi wasn't as 'crispy' this time. In retrospect, 'crispy' may be a bit misleading. It's more 'browned' than 'crispy'. Nonetheless, it wasn't as 'browned' in the to go order.)  * Grilled Octopus \"soy marinated\" ($7) - Three little octupi sat on the plate along with some greens.  I like grilled octopus in general, so we liked this dish.  It can be a bit daunting for those not wanting to see the head of a baby octopus.  * Seared Diver Scallops \"lemon beurre blanc\" ($7.50) - I didn't realize this dish had other items on it besides scallops, so was confused by the texture in my mouth when I thought I eating scallop. I guess along with the scallops were tater tot like disks.  The sauce was a bit fruity.  * Truffle Parmesan Fries \"sea salt, parsley, lemon garlic sauce\" ($6) - It came with two dipping sauces and the chunks of garlic were falling off.  * Portobello Fries \"lightly breaded\" ($6) - This also came with two dipping sauces.  * Roasted Beet and Apple Salad \"arugula, candied walnuts, balsamic vinaigrette\" ($8) - We like beet salads, but it seemed like this salad missed a little something.  They did shave some Parmesan cheese on there, but maybe it needed more nuts?  * Clam Linguini \"surf clams, roasted garlic, garden herbs, Italian parsley & white wine extra virgin olive oil broth\" ($13) - We took this dish to go for my mom.  She's a big fan of clam linguine and the first thing she noticed was the amount of clams.  She gobbled up the dish and even saved the sauce for the next day.  (She said it was good, but there wasn't enough for the price.) (Update! The Husband obviously liked what he saw when we ordered this for my mom. So the following week he got an order to go!)  Service - The staff were attentive, perhaps even too attentive.  I appreciate more than less, so I can't complain too much.  The restaurant wasn't busy, so they were coming around a lot to ask how things were and if we wanted to order more.  The owner (one of the partners) came around to see how we were doing too. I appreciate when the owners take an active part in their new business ventures because it can show a genuine interest in their clientele, especially if they become regulars.  He mentioned that this was a family-friendly restaurant, which we do appreciate (and noticed a kids' menu available too).  Overall, we like The Sparklings but are a bit confused.  It's very upscale in appearance, but a mix of casual in the menu.  I think they can actually expand on the menu a bit more, and perhaps they will with time.  But for the time being, we just couldn't find anything in the entrees that interested us.  (Items ranged from sandwiches like Philly Cheese Steak ($8.50) and Shrimp Po Boy ($8.50) to pastas, salmon and meats, ie. Rib-Eye Steak ($25) and Filet Mignon ($25).  They do offer a happy hour in the lounge/bar area from 5 pm to 10 pm daily, which means discounted drinks.  Only those over 21 years of age allowed into the restaurant after 11 pm.",

I have been back 3 times since then, its the perfect location to have a nice date night... not to expensive, not to high class... a great spot overall.    I will be back again and again.  Oh Bonus !!! The Owner and Staff are all amazing..  Try out their cocktails !!!!!!",

    "text": "The staff was friendly, service was good.  I found the decor to be different yet relaxing.  The bar/ lounge area was really cool however the dining room seem to be a little detached from the food being served.  Upon entering the restaurant it appears to be a fine dinning restaurant but as I walk through the dinning room I noticed that all the tables we undecorated except a few that had small plates with flatware rolled up in paper napkins.  It would have been nice to see some sort of decoration on the tables to follow the theme.  The food was decent I order the Spicy Linguine Seafood Pasta. The seafood was fresh however I felt the dish was unbalance in flavor.  I will return at a later date to try some of the other menu items in hope of finding dishes that are more balanced in flavor. Give it a try!!",

He brought a lively vibe to our dining experience and was eager to help us celebrate a big event for our group. He guided us through the menu with expertise and thoughtful descriptions that held True to taste.  The drinks we enjoyed was 1)Amethyst 2) Emerald 3) Sparkling They were each delicious but our favorite was the emerald.  For the appetizer we enjoyed the scallops and the crispy gnocchi. Both were delightful and will be ordered again.  For entrees we ordered the spicy seafood pasta, the clam linguini and the mushroom bacon cream sauce pasta with chicken.  The spicy seafood pasta was indeed spicy but not overwhelmingly so. I am sensitive to very spicy things. 6/10 for spicy but it was very flavorful and will be ordered again.  The clam linguini was Good but not spectacular as the other dishes.  The mushroom bacon cream pasta was delicious.    The most enjoyable item we ordered was the crispy gnocchi but the whole meal was a delight.",

The gnocci was good and the service was good both times I went but the rest of the food was very bland and/or rubbery.  Sucks because we need more restaurants in the SW, especially privately owned ones.",

They offer some creative appetizers like bacon & dates wrapped meatballs and the crispy gnocchi. The name is a bit misleading because the gnocchi itself isn't crispy, but the dish is still good. The braised short rib came highly recommended but I found it way too salty. The flourless chocolate was surprisingly my favorite item to try. Most of the appetizers and entrees don't really spur any excitement for me but overall, The Sparklings is a nice place to spend happy hour or a quiet date night without breaking the bank.",

By the time his meal finally came out, all 3 of us had completely finished ours. This is fine because we understand mistakes happen, but our waitress not once came over in that time to mention what was going on our tell us that his meal would be out shortly. They offered us dessert on the house but by that time our friend had a plane to catch and we didn't have time. They didn't take his meal off (which any establishment should/would have done for their mistake) and he only ate half of it because at that point we had all shared our meals with him because he was sitting there with nothing in front of him.",

However, it is the exact opposite... 5 stars in every way.  The decor is elegant, the drink selection is spot on, and the service was tip top.  We chopped the chicken parm and a filet.  The chicken parm was fresh and the steak is easily the best suburban option past midnight.  My wife loved the cheesecake I got to go so it was clearly a success.  I'm sure I will find myself here again soon.",

    "text": "First time here for my husband and I. I read the reviews a few months ago and kept telling myself that I eventually want to check this place out. Plus I drive past it all the time because I live right down the road. Finally my husband and I had a free night to check it out. Its a pretty small place. Not very intimate. From some of the other reviews I read people have said its 'beautiful'. If you look up there are fans and almost like a warehouse ceiling. A huge chandelier hangs in the middle that pretty much looks out of place. Between the fans and warehouse looking ceiling the chandelier doesnt look like it belongs there. The bar area looked decent it was more busy than the actual restaurant. Seems to me this place would make a better bar lounge possibly local dance place instead of a wanna be classy bar/restaurant. The middle could possibly be a big dance floor. But thats just my opinion.   The food was decent. My husband had a Club sandwitch which he said was tasty. We both had clam chowder which was really good minus he fact the waiter never offered crushed pepper for my husband soup. Waiters should always offer crushed pepper for soup. My husbands soupspoon had dried up food on the one side of it. Which was pretty disgusting. I called over the waiter and he apologized and replaced it with a 'tea spoon' I'm guessing all of the soup spoons were gone.We also ordered the calamari off the appetizers. It wasn't very good...possibly not cooked enough and the marinara sauce that came with it had zero flavor. I wasn't impressed by the calamari at all. I ordered a Caesar salad which was very dry needed more dressing but the waiter took too long to come by so I just ate it that way. This place was ok. I wont recommend it to any of my friends due to the fact that there are better places around town with much better calamari and atmosphere. It will be one of those place I go to if I want to be close to home so I dont need to drive far but its not my favorite. It wasnt horrible but it wasnt as great as I expected. Sometimes you dont know how places are just by reading yelp reviews you need to go there and see for yourself. Beautiful and amazing to one person might be just Ok and decent for another.",
