We always get something different so we can all share to try each others. It is also fun to watch from the order window of them making the crepes. You would go here if you knew what was good for ya buddy.",

    "text": "FYI:  I am not reviewing the coffee, the price tag, or anything else on this review.  I consider them all worthy of being considered as criteria on the five star scale, but some food items are so tasty as to render all flaws meaningless.  Enter the peanut butter crepe.  Ordinarily when I go to Le Creperie I order the nutella crepe.  Chocolate hazelnut goo inside a thin, chewy, magical crepe and buried under a mountain of whipped cream.  But this day I saw on the menu a different crepe.  My wandering eyes betrayed the nutella and settled on \"banana\" and \"peanut butter\" and saw no alternative.  Thank you, wandering eyes.  If you could distill Beethoven's fifth symphony into a dessert, this crepe is what you'd get.  Ripe bananas bursting with sugar.  Peanutty, not-sweet peanut butter for contrast, and then a pound of whipped cream and carmel sauce all accompanied by a crepe make for one of the best desserts I've ever had.  Yes, you need to take your keys to your car, put them in the ignition, and drive straight to LV to get this crepe.",

Do we really have to be up and out of the hotel room by 10 a.m. for a decent breakfast meal?  That's how we ended up at La Creperie.  They actually had a crepe (the \"Du Soleil\") with veggies, scrambled egg, cheese and bechamel sauce on top.  Not the best crepe I've ever had, but fulfilled the egg requirement and was pretty tasty overall.  There was a fruity one that would have sufficed for breakfast as well, but I needed the protein.  Service was fast and friendly, and prices are better here than most places we found.",

    "text": "This was my first crepe ever, so I dont have much crepe experience. But i can pick out some faults...  The boyfriend and I came here this past weekend, and were delightfully satisfied.  I ordered the D'Anjou. Which is a sweet crepe, with Almond Paste, Pears, and walnuts, topped with caramel sauce. Now, when they say \"topped with a caramel sauce\" they actually mean: \"3 skinny lines of caramel, carelessly scattered across your plate and crepe\"  It was delicious though. The pears were canned, which at first, i was against, but then as i was eating it, i came the the conclusion that they were perfect because fresh pears would've been too hard. these still had a nice bite to them though, they weren't soggy. The almond paste gave a sweet, smooth, nutty blanket in the background.. it wasn't over powering with almond flavor.  The boyfriend ordered The Favorite. which was also a sweet crepe, stuffed with all types of berries (blueberries and strawberries come to mind, but i know there were more) topped with a berry sauce. It was very tangy, which complimented the sweet crepe perfectly.  The down side to this place, is the line. You order, and then spend 15-20 mins (depending on how big the line is.. more or less.) standing off to the side, waiting for your number to be called. Oh, and bottled water is $4 (for the small bottle) and $5 (for the bigger bottle.)   The crepes are about $9... so for both our crepes, and 2 waters, the total came to $30. Was it worth $30? No. Not at all. But that's Vegas... you're mostly paying for where you're eating, secondary is WHAT you're eating.",

    "text": "When in Paris, do as Parisians do.  When in Paris Las Vegas, stop by La Creperie.    I come here a few times a year for a quick, casual breakfast.  Notice I didn't say \"cheap,\" because that's one thing it is NOT.  $8.99 a crepe is a lot of money.  I guess they have to pay for their charming location on Le Boulevard inside Le Casino.  La Creperie only offers food for takeout, although there's a charming seating area to the left of the stand.  Go with a friend and have him or her save you a seat.  The seating area is pretty small, and you might have to get creative about getting a table.  The crepes are made to order, so get ready to wait 4-5 minutes for your order.  Since I have to order two of everything, I opted for two crepes: one breakfast crepe and one dessert crepe  They offer 6 breakfast crepe choices and 6 dessert crepe choices.  I went with a St. Louis crepe (pronounced \"sen-loo-WEE,\" like the Tampa Bay Lightning player, not like the city in Missouri) and a Peanut crepe (no pronunciation tips necessary).    The St. Louis had prosciutto, cheese, basil and was drenched in bechamel sauce.  The sauce was thick, but a bit mealy.  Actually, now that I think about it, it looked pretty disgusting, kind of like milky cream of wheat.  The crepe was very tasty and filling, though.  The second crepe, the Peanut was chock full of chunky peanut butter and bananas.  I would have called it The Elvis (in loving memory).  The Peanut was very sweet, but it still made for a pretty good dessert.  It's not the best dessert crepe out there, though.  Berry and fruit crepes are much better.  Piece of advice: skip the coffee.  It's too weak and taste-less.  I saw people walking around with Starbucks cups.  If I hadn't been so lazy, I would have stopped by a Starbucks before ordering my crepes.  Starbucks is not very Paris like, but . . . you know how they say that Seattle is the Paris of the Pacific Northwest?  Well, they don't really say it, but they could.",

Cost - For the crepe I would consider it fair, especially in Vegas. However, the price of coffee was stupid. $4 for a coffee is a bit much and it gets closer to $10 if you add a shot of something to it. Yikes.  I chose a sweet and my wife chose savory. We were both happy with our selections.   The biggest downside to ordering from here during breakfast hours is a lack of somewhere to sit. La Creperie is right next to another food stop (and across from a buffet) and seating can become a bit of an issue.   But based purely on food taste, amount for dollars and service - I think it's pretty good eats. Check it out if you're looking for something a little different and delicious.",

My wife ordered the one with spinach and I had the one with sausage, marinara sauce, and a ton of cheese. Like someone else had mentioned, too much cheesy goodness for my taste. I felt like I had eaten enough cheese from an entire large pizza. The stomach can only handle so much coagulated cow's milk.  If it's busy with a line, be prepared for a wait until you receive your food since they are individually made fresh. It felt like I waited close to over half an hour waiting for my food. And at $9 a pop, they aren't exactly the best bargains, but pretty decent to hit the spot if you're craving it. Next time I'll have to try their dessert versions.",

I got La Forestiere, which had spinach, mushrooms, boursin and mozzarella, though I was tempted to get the crepe with ratatouille so I could have been reminded about cartoon cooking mice....  It looked like they covered all the savory crepes in bechamel sauce, which was congealy but tasted kind of good -- it was late, I was hungry.  Sure, it was almost ten bucks, but I probably would have spent just as much on something at one of the cafes, and for those with girly appetites, there was plenty for two people to share.

Sure you think, free drink, no big deal.  Well, at $2.99 a drink, we were appreciative of the insider tip card!  I have had crepes before - the best being in Vancouver, BC.  But here, in the end, the crepes were ok.  We got one of the salty ones -  the size was enough for 2 people.  I think they were unable to keep up with the volume of orders b/c the veggie filling inside was cold.

It was a hard decision between the wild mushroom and the shrimp scampi but I ended up choosing the shrimp scampi. It was amazing! The portion is reasonable but could've been bigger.

Just a couple of glasses to drink your tap water. Sorry sir - glass you pay for but water is free.  The END : I was carrying an empty tall glass which was once filled with Margarita. I went to the soda machine - stuffed my glass in there & drank a tall glass of FREE WATER.  If you own this place & are reading my review - STOP being cheapskates. You are virtually violating us with the prices - atleast give us a glass for water.",

It is usually not clean, and most of the chairs are broken - many are mismatched extra banquet chairs.  Both times I have dined here recently, they have gotten my order wrong.  One time, they forgot one of the crepes, and were rather rude when we brought this to their attention.  The next time, they tried to charge us for two crepes even though we only ordered one.  Not sure why the staff here has such a difficult time taking orders properly.  My biggest complaint is that they charge for water.  I find it to be unacceptable service when I pay for food and tap water is not available free of charge.  Furthermore, if you are going to charge me for a cup, it would have been nice to give me a full size cup, rather than a very small one, which I had to refill multiple times.  I asked if I could have the larger cup instead, and the answer was a firm no.  I understand that they want it to be plastic, so that it is see-through, and more difficult to steal a drink other than water, but make it a bigger size.  This kind of nickel and diming is no way to treat paying customers and says a lot about why Caesars, which owns the Paris, is $25B in debt and nearing bankruptcy.",

Sometimes you need a lighter side to vegas than the heffer status buffets or the man size steaks in every hotel.  What I like about La Creperie is the simplicity of it all.  You order, they make, they serve on a paper plate.  Nothing fancy about it.  My boyfriend and I shared the fruits de mer and favorite crepe.  The fruits de mer has succulunt shrimp and bay scallops covered in a \"lightish\" bechamel sauce (as light as bechamel can be).  The favorite crepe comes with a variety of berries along with a massive dollop of fresh whipped cream and powdered sugar.  It seriously comfort food done well.  We always come here on our trips to Vegas usually the day we're leaving, trying to minimize anymore gluttony we've experienced throughout our trip.",

La Creperie offers both savory crepes and dessert crepes.  Although the savory crepes are nice once in awhile for me, I mainly like to order the dessert crepes from here.  The Nutella Crepe is my favorite at La Creperie, I wouldn't want to get any other crepe but if I had to choose another, I would order the Banana Foster's Crepe.  Lines get long during peak periods.  I like to come between lunch and dinner times when the lines move faster and the lines are not long at all.  Whatever you do, try the NUTELLA!!!...if you visit La Creperie.",

It's akin to getting Chinese at those Panda Express strip malls.   For $9 apiece,  the crepes are really passable. They do stuff it chockful of fresh ingredients.   Three of us shared the Napolean. The crepe is stuffed with berries and a generous amount of lemon curd and whipped cream are ladled on top of it. A perfect blend of sweet and sour.  We also had the St. Louis, which is ham and fresh basil with bechamel sauce. Not disappointing either.  Yes, if you go when the lines are long, you won't find many places to sit as it's not a restaurant.   Definitely a good snack if you want to save room for dinner. Beats eating junk or McDonald's.  * Photos shot.",

The cashier lady was very nice and kind, but seemed to have a bit of trouble at the register.  I think maybe something was broken so it took a while for us just to get to order.  I ordered the Napoleon crepe, lemon custard, berries, chantilly cream, nom nom nom! It was REALLY good, the tartness of the custard and lightly sweet thick chantilly cream worked well together.  Unfortunately they don't fill all the way to the edge so the front tip of the triangle is filled while the back end is just crepe.  Is that how it's done in Paris?  I also feel like they were a bit too thick and eggy to be considered \"good\" crepes, but it was tasty nonetheless. I think the filling just sold me...  $9.99 does seem expensive to me for a crepe since they are kind of cheap to make...but it is Vegas so got to expect everything to be expensive :P  I MIGHT come back here again just for the Napoleon...if I'm ever in Vegas again...",

I realized that the line was long partially because only one person was working. That person not only took orders and payment but also made the crepes themselves. I must have waited 15 minutes for a light breakfast snack.  I ordered the Nutella crepe and honestly was not disappointed at all. It was sweet but not too sweet. The crepe resembled almost like a dumpling in that most of the filling was towards the back and the front was mostly just the crepe layer itself. Not a terrible thing but I would have liked it more even.  There is a decent size sitting area right next to this place to enjoy the crepe.  Overall, pretty good crepe in a thematic casino here. Pricing not ridiculously expensive, about $11-12 for mine but not cheap either.

We came into Paris to grab a crepe before we were headed home and not only are they just not that fantastic, you have to endure these run down hotels to access these places.   There are a handful of hotels in Vegas that you can have a really nice experience in and there are others I just don't need to step foot in.  That being said, I can probably find a crepe at one I can stand to be in but we did stop off at La Creperie. I've been here plenty of times in the past. YEARS ago, many, many years ago when Paris was actually a fairy decent/average acceptable hotel and a couple times in the last few years.  I ordered the Fresh Berry - it was less than satisfactory but my boyfriend ordered the Ham and Cheese which was actually pretty tasty.   Definitely go Savory over Sweet here and that's something you'll very rarely catch me suggesting as I'm a total sweets girl! Love em'. Team Dessert forever! but you will be disappointed in the Sweet options, I have been the past couple of times I've had a crepe from here. The ingredients don't taste fresh or of good quality, this is strictly filler food. If you've had one two many drinks and don't care about how many calories you're puttin' away - order one.",

    "text": "Terrible service, waited at the window while the ladies who work there decided to finish their conversation with each other. That was first bad impression. Secondly my daughter wanted a Nutella crepe with strawberry's. They only have mixed Berry's which is fine and we simply asked if they could do there best just to get mainly  strawberry's and got a rude reply of no. I was willing to pay for the Berry's and was just asking for a simple effort to accommodate strawberry's as best as possible and got shot done rudely. Anyways the Nutella crepe was good but it's unfortunate we will not be back do the lack of professionalism in the staff. I only gave one star because I'm a huge believer in customer service. Sometimes it plays more of a role in your business then anything else. Maybe they own the place and that's how they run their business but if I was the owner I would want to know.",

    "text": "I'm a huge breakfast lover. I can have French toast, crepes, or omelets at all hours of the day or night. When I was told that the Paris had an amazing crepe place I practically started running toward it. But when I finally saw the restaurant I got kind of bummed. I was expecting an actual restaurant and not a walk-up stand. But after realizing that it's supposed to resemble the walk-up creperies in Paris, France I was okay with the idea.  The line didn't take too long (maybe fifteen minutes or so) but when we're all about to eat our left hands out of hunger, fifteen minutes feels like an eternity. Finally we got to the front of the line. The menu has several savory crepes with meats and cheese as well as dessert crepes with berries, whipped cream, and other sugary additions.  I pretty much only like dessert crepes so my eyes lit up when I saw their abundance of fruits and sauces. I went with the Favorite crepe (with fresh berries, whipped cream, and topped with raspberry coulis). It was served to me at the pick-up counter on a cafeteria trey and a plastic plate. Lame. I then had to turn the corner and grab a plastic knife and plastic fork. Lame. Then came the really fun part; watching over people like hawks until a table opens up. The small seating area is just next door to La Creperie but it's open to anybody that wishes to sit there (surrounding snack stands, or people just giving their bunions a break).  After a couple minutes, we snagged a table and began digging in to our lovely crepes. They were almost impossible to cut into. The plastic utensils, plastic plates, and plastic treys made the crepes slide about relentlessly. After finally wrangling the thing down and cutting it up I got to taste it. Sheesh. I now understand why people were telling us to go here. The crepes were fantastic. However, I was somewhat distracted while we were eating. Several Miss America pageant girls came in and sat at the table next to us, fully equipped with tiaras and sashes. Awesome.  A tip after eating at La Creperie, go just across the walkway and pick up one of the humongous Eiffel Tower margaritas. You won't be disappointed!",

We were so hungry we stopped by the restaurants near the entrances and front desks just to get a quick bite.    Now, the two of us met at a creperie that we worked at five years ago, and we know our French and Japanese crepes pretty damn well - these quick crepes were flavorful and seemed to never be enough.  With total rewards card for Caesar Casinos, including Paris, you could save a dollar or so each crepe!  Never got to try a sweet one, but the savory pesto roasted chicken crepe is highly recommended.  The shrimp scampi crepe is super buttery and feels like it's coating my throat, but I wouldn't say it was a True ode to shrimp scampi pasta if it didn't!",

They are consistently good. When in Vegas I have a crepe for breakfast, and another for a midnight snack.  Tips from a regular.....   - They stop taking orders about 15 minutes before they close. So if when they close at 11 pm, you need to be in line by 10:45 pm.   -  Order the combo. No matter the crepe's price, if you order a combo, you get the crepe and drink for 10.99. Depending on the time of year, the combo might be 9.99. The combo is a better deal than the rewards price.    - If you get a soft drink or coffee, just ask for your drink cup, then go next door to JJ's Boulangerie, for your drink. The crepe window is part of JJ's, and inside JJ's they have a larger selection of soft drinks and teas.",

Actually, we stopped that time cause our niece and nephew wanted crepes, and there were no lines on that occasion.  They've got the usual crepe choices.  Both savory crepes and dessert crepes.  I always prefer the dessert crepes cause I am such a sweet tooth.  The prices are expensive compared to most crepes that I've had elsewhere.  Although, if you are a Total Rewards member, then you get a discounted price of 50 cents off.  Still expensive though.  Our niece and nephew both enjoyed their choices while my wife and I thought our orders were just average.  Both my niece and I ordered the Nutella crepe which contained nutella, bananas, candied hazelnuts, cream, and caramel sauce.   She said she would give it 8 out of 10.  I thought that for the price, it was just average.  It tasted fine, but it should be priced 2 to 3 dollars lower.  Same for the other crepes that we ordered which were the mixed berries crepe and the ham & cheese crepe.    Overall, just 3 stars because the crepes are overpriced.  I know that we're on the Las Vegas Strip, but come on!  Well, obviously the prices do not hurt business cause they usually have people waiting to order at the window when we walk by.  Good for them.",

We ordered two Roasted Chicken ($11.00) which consisted of rotisserie chicken, sun dried tomatoes, asparagus, basil pesto & shaved grana padano.   Overall verdict: pretty good.   The crepe batter itself was a little sweeter than I would've liked it, the tomatoes had a weird texture to them and the basil pesto could have used a little more \"umph\", but overall, not bad for a snack.

    "text": "La Creperie is a little food stand located Paris Casino, right next to La Pizza and Le Village Buffet.  They specialize in crepes of course, and have about a half-dozen savory versions and half-dozen dessert versions.  Maybe that's why they open 7am to 11pm!  We wanted something sweet after lunch to neutralize the salty aftertaste from eating at Bellagio's Noodles.  The Banana Foster Crepe was a great antidote!  Huge, thin crepe stuffed with slices of bananas and drizzled with rum and caramel sauce.  I liked the nice touches with the candied pecan topping and side of Chantilly cream.  Would have been awesome of they flambeed the thing but still, solid 4 stars.    The black coffee is also very good here - great balance of bold, slightly tart, and ending on a smooth note. Plenty of seating and a restroom (Le Toilet) next to the food stand.",

Reasonably priced, for the portion you're getting. And when plated, it looks beautiful and decadent. Can get a small discount if you're a Total Rewards member.  Everything fresh and made to order. And a large and very filling crepe!   Hazelnut/banana - I thoroughly enjoyed this hearty crepe and by the time I finished, I was stuffed! Full of banana chunks and generous layer of Nutella. Every bite was oozing with it, and the light, airy cream complimented the crepe perfectly. Comes with candied hazelnuts but I nixed that. $11  Blueberry lemon - giant blueberries on top of the crepe! Looked so fresh and delicious. No mushy blueberries here. But my husband was not a fan of this crepe, because of the lemon curd filling. There was no texture, and to him it seemed a bit gooey. He said the crepe itself was tasty and was not overly sweet. $11.25  We took ours to-go. The girl taking our order was very pleasant. The girl forgot this, but easily popped a lid onto our plate. Utensils and napkins to the side!   If there was a small line, it often moved very quickly.",

This place is inside the Paris hotel and it is a little ways back from the strip entrance to the hotel so you'll have to walk through the entire casino floor and walk down past quite a few other stores and places to eat. Also, this place is a hole in the wall with no seating attached. You'll have to use the tables that are shared among all the near by food places and during peak times, you might not find a table...or have to eat euro style...that means sitting with another group at the same table. Hey, space is limited, make it happen.  We tried the Nutella and the banana foster crepes. The bananas foster crepe was okay. It wasn't bad but wasn't as great as it sounded on the menu. But the Nutella crepe did NOT disappoint!   I actually enjoyed not only the crepes but the overall experience of getting to the place and finding a seat in the open seating area. It felt a little bit like actually being back in Europe to me.",

    "text": "Best savory and dessert French style crepes! ..if they get everything that's supposed to be in it that is. Crepes are BIG, can be shareable, fairly priced to me.   The crepes themselves are super buttery. I could eat it with just the homemade chantilly cream and I'd be happy, but why stop there? I go for the nutella crepe without bananas. Have asked it with strawberry a few times and have gotten it with it twice; sometimes they'll say yes, most times it's a no lol. The hazelnuts are addicting. The fresh berry crepe is also a good choice. They don't lather the crepe too much with the strawberry compote, then you got the fresh blueberries and blackberries on top. That big dollop of chantilly cream will be gone before you know it.  Going the savory route, anything with the bechamel sauce is good imo,  because that sauce is just luxurious. Do try the shrimp scampi and roasted chicken, you'll find yourself craving it at times. Sometimes they skimp on the shrimp though..  Ordered the roasted chicken crepe during a busy time and they completely forgot the bechamel sauce.. without it the crepe was so dry and bland. No biggie though, told them there was no sauce, they handed it to us on the side and we got more bechamel than had they put it on.  Sometimes it's really busy,  sometimes it's not, but you gotta be patient for sure. It'll be worth it.",

(I REALLY wanted one of those delicious-looking dessert ones, but I had a busy day and didn't want to be in the bathroom all day later)  I think I paid around 8:40 (and there were only like 5 people ahead of me in line, too) and FINALLY got my crepe around 9am.   That being said, the reason that it takes so long is that they make them fresh, so they are delicious. I will say I asked for no asparagus, though, and was told they couldn't do that, because they use a mix or something strange like that ... but it tasted fresh.  The roasted chicken one had chicken, asparagus, sundried tomatoes, I think onions, and a pesto sauce, and was pretty good. Price range from $9-11 or $12.   I will say that my parents have been to Paris's \"Le Village Buffet\" before, though, and you can have made-to-order crepes there, so if you think you'll want more than just a crepe, you should check that out - they have both crepes and omelettes.  I'll come back here next time I'm in Vegas, I want to try either the caprese crepe (savory) or one of the dessert ones, which looked amazing.",

I dined here with a group of 6-7 people, so I got to try several crepes from both the \"Savory\" section and the \"Dessert\" section. I personally ordered the \"Roasted Chicken\" and it was pretty decent. Spinach and artichoke, Tomato Mozzarella, and Cinnamon Bun were pretty good too. My personal favorite out of all the crepes that me and friends got was of course the NUTELLA. So, if you're trying to go for something filling and somewhat healthy, get what I got (Roasted Chicken). Otherwise, go NUTELLA all the way and enjoy every second of your hangover meal with some coffee (they also have coffee and other espresso beverages).   Open from 7AM to 11PM.",

I wasn't expecting a great crepe since if seems like a fast food take out place. The servers also barely interacted and they just looked tired/bored.   I ordered the monte cristo . It was a sweet and savoury crepe. It's filled with ham, turkey, and Swiss cheese, topped with strawberry jam and sugar. I found it a bit too soggy for my liking. They poured way too much jam on the crepe that everything started to taste the same to me. I felt like I'm just eating a crepe with jam. I could no longer taste the ham and cheese. Maybe I would be more satisfied if I stuck to something less creative like a common breakfast crepe. I didn't enjoy my crepe at all and the service didn't make my experience any better.",

Does this mean I thought it was a good idea to go down there?  YES!!  You ask why would you do such a thing? Because all I care about is food. That's why.  I'm fat and single so I took myself on a date. I scoped La Creperie out yesterday and was thinking ALL day and dreamed last night and didn't eat at all today in anticipation of crepes. Specifically the Three cheese crepe. Cheese is LIFE. If cheese were to cease existing and I couldn't get it on the black market I would legit throw myself off a mountain.   Well SNAPDIZZLE they don't have it,  (yes, I just Snoop Dogged a word that I made up) I even asked for it because I didn't see it in the menu.  It hasn't been on the menu for three years they said.  Hey, Paris get your shizznitt together and update your menu! Like it's hard??  I was dressed nice for once and needed to impress nobody so naturally I went for something not messy (if I am on a date with an actual man I make sure I get the messiest thing possible to spill on myself and if he's not embarrassed by that I know he's a keeper-Pro dating tip for free! Aren't you glad you read this review?) Okay, anyway I got the plain old butter and sugar crepe, I figure why not try it in its purest form? I mean this IS the place right, to get a crepe? It was fine. (You know when a woman says \"fine\", things are probably not fine.) It was completely unsatisfying. It took forever to get and it was delicious in its mediocrity. It's not what I wanted.  It's not what I risked life and limb for. I am trying to console myself with if the Three Cheese Crepe was that fantastic it would still be on the menu still. It wasn't worth the drive and the hassle to get there. Locals park free at Paris btw. And to top things off I got lost going home, took several wrong turns and ended up circling the airport. I blame La Creperie for this for throwing me off my game and having the wrong menu online! I'll never get this time back that I wasted looking online, thinking about it, driving there, dealing with the self parking, getting lost and ultimately being disappointed. On a high note today was not the end of the world. Namaste.",

If Richard Z or Dallas G beat me to one more review I am going to hurl myself from atop the Luxor obelisk, which by the way, Richard can't tell if it is here nor there. But I digress.   I was introduced to this little crepe place oh so many years ago by either Dallas or Richard and have been in love ever since. My staple was the Normandy, warm apples, caramel, and the ton of whipped cream everyone talks about. I was happy with this, content you could say. I have strayed in the past, trying a savory as opposed to sweet crepe, but it just wasn't the same.   This most recent trip to Sin City I was messaged by Mr Z and told about a new delectable crepe being offered: The Peanut Butter and Banana crepe. Anyone who knows me, knows my love affair with peanut butter is a long and satisfying one. Bananas are a new love and I recently discovered that the two combined are an unstoppable force.  Throw in a thin, chewy crepe, and some of the whipped cream and you have yourself... well just look at the picture.  The line for this place can seem like an eternity, but the people watching is entertaining.  Any trip to Vegas seems incomplete when we are just unable to fit Le Creperie into the mix.",

While this is not the best food to eat if you are trying to recover from a previous evening, but it is still satisfying and delicious.   I had an odd combination on my crepe which included ratatouille, cheese, and bechamel sauce. Extremely unique, the ratatouille tasted a little bit more like salsa in some bites than it did like ratatouille but it was still good nonetheless.  We had tried to come here the previous day but the line was absurd. It looked like it would be about a 45 minute wait. FOR A CREPE! I don't think it's worth it to wait THAT long, but if you need a quick snack or a meal on the go, it's a good place to stop.   It was about $10 for the crepe - a little pricey for what it was since most that I get in Seattle are $6 or $7, but for the Vegas strip, I suppose it's fairly reasonable. It's all relative.",

My girls and I were very excited to have breakfast at this place on our first morning in Las Vegas. Sadly, we were met by a long line which did not seem to shorten at all, thanks to only one working cook and two crepe grills. Assuming that every customer orders 1-2 crepes each, it is not surprising that the service was very slow. I ended up waiting for 15 minutes to get one crepe.   The portion is pretty general, though. One crepe is definitely split-able between 2 people.   Moreover, I think they lack some serious variety of crepes. There are only about 6 kinds for each of the sweet and savory crepe categories. And none of them specifically sounded appetizing to me. I ended up ordering one sweet and one savory crepes.  Granted that it is very hard to screw things up with chocolate, this place has miraculously produced crepes that were too sweet and creamy for my taste. I felt a bit queasy afterwards.   Nothing was absolutely terrible, but the service could have definitely been faster. But would I pay $10 to eat at this place again? Probably not.",

    "text": "So I have been wanting to try this place since last year. Paris is my favorite city so what better place to eat than at Paris Las Vegas.  Even though it's early Sunday morning it's crazy here.  It's not a big surprise that the lines a pretty long although here they are not to crazy.  They have a good selection of savory and sweet crepes along with coffe and hot chocolate.  Since it's morning I decided to have a ham and cheese because who doesn't like ham and cheese. Along with water it's a pretty healthy meal.  The size of my Crepe was not huge but it was fairly big and full of ham.    As we waited for our crepes I will admit it was a fairly long wait but hey its Vegas what do you expect.  After finally getting our crepes we looked for a place to sit.  About the only downfall to this place is the fact that that there are definitely  not enough places to sit.  We walked all around the area without a seat to be found. So we saw a tall table and decided what the heck let's just stand and eat.  I will say standing and eating can actually be good because I didn't feel as stuffed. All in all this place for me was worth the wait. The Crepe was perfectly cooked with the right amount of food to get you going. I will be coming back And word of advice nothing in Vegas is quick so be prepared to encounter long lines and wait times. Also if you can have someone in party secure seating for you because not everyone likes to stand and eat.p",

We got a breakfast crepe and a dessert crepe and loved them both. It was perfectly cooked, with the perfect amount of sweetness in the dessert crepe. And the breakfast crepe was so savory. It's in Ceasar's Palace so it's just a matter of finding the Little Paris food court. And the tables are first come first serve, so beware if you are going at a busy time. It might take a while to get a table but these crepes were with it. Also the lady working the register was super nice, she warned me before I ordered that it would take at least 15 minutes. So I went and found a table in the meantime, when I went back to get my food not only was it ready early but she also recognized me and gave me my order immediately.",

Even after I give you the bad, I definitely urge you to stop by for a crepe.   Now the reason for three stars...  The customer service is HORRIBLE. You can clearly tell Liliana despises her job. We planned on walking the strip for a bit so asked what time they would be closing. She ignored us, did a couple tasks, then sharply responded with \"midnight.\" No smile, no other words, not even eye contact. Then, when we went back, it didn't get any better. She didn't say anything upon approaching the counter; just waited for us to order. We wanted a couple ingredients taken off of a crepe and she snapped back with it being the same price. We stated that we were aware of this and she instantly cut us off mid-sentence. I'm not expecting Disney World-esque customer service, but at least pretend you enjoy your job. I would say maybe she's had a bad day, but this is not the first negative encounter we've had with her and upon reading other reviews, other people have had negative customer service experiences as well.   The only other negative would be price. I'm not too concerned with this as we expect nothing less being on the Las Vegas strip, in a tourist trap. They running at about a 21% food cost which is equitable to a bar, not a cafe. Elsewhere, the exact same product would be closer to $7, we spent $10.50 per crepe.   Again, I would recommend trying their crepes. Just go into it expecting to spend a pretty penny and expecting a rude encounter.",

There's only one person taking orders as well as handing out the crepes once they are done. I actually noticed that my crepe order was ready for a while before the cashier/order taker/food giver noticed. Operations would be much more efficient if they had another person handing out the crepes.   If you're a Total Rewards member, you can get a discount on the crepes, but they also offer a crepe special where you can get a crepe and a drink for less than what the price of a crepe costs. I'm not sure how they make money off of that, but whatever, my mom and I both ordered the special. I got the ham and cheese crepe and my mom got the fresh berry crepe. Both were good, but I thought my ham and cheese was a little dry and could have used more cheese. The fresh berry one could use more berries. For the price we paid, I was expecting a little more.   Seating is pretty easy to find as there's an open sitting area next to La Creperie. If the restaurant next door is closed, you can also sit there.   I probably would try a crepe again, but only if there wasn't a line!",

    "text": "I LOVE this place!!!  This will be my 3rd or fourth time to this yummy creperie place.   What makes it special is the quality and yumminess of the crepe itself and the creme they put on top. Its addicting! Seriously! Plus the fact that they do NOT use canned ingredients for the fruits and veggies.   The best selections are the dessert crepes - they use real fruits which is beneficial because they do not soak through the fluffy crepe batter. I had the \"Favorite\" which consists of fresh berries and cream...so good!   The nutella with strawberries and bananas is also yummy,   The Toulous is good for marinara lovers, while the Spinach Cheese Mushroom is also really good.   Their crepes are quite sizeable as well!   For coffee lovers, this place is quality.  They offer smooth and well-flavored quality coffee.  The only bummer is the slow service - it's a walk up window and there's almost always a line, whether weekday or weekend. I've tried both and stood in a line no matter what. (mind you this is around the holidays).",

The portion size on the crepes were more than enough. They were packed with lots of flavor and quite yummy!   I'd definitely come again to grab a crepe the next time I visit Paris!",

    "text": "In recent years La Creperie at The Paris Hotel & Casino in Las Vegas has become one of my Las Vegas eating staples. I can not complete a trip to Vegas without a delicious crepe (sometimes two).  My last trip to Las Vegas, I had a delicious \"Seafood Crepe\" featuring scallops and shrimp smothered in a sauce that I still think of to this day.  Later in my trip i stopped in for dessert and had my usual \"The Nutella\", Peanut butter & Banana's smothered in chocolate syrup and whipped cream. This has got to be the greatest dessert on earth...  Location wise it's easy to miss La Creperie. As you walk through the Paris \"food court\" (more of a hallway) it is stuffed between two large restaurants. There is VERY limited seating and sometimes you have to battle it out for a table but people seem to come and go fast enough that you shouldn't have a problem.  Price-wise it's extremely reasonable when you consider the quality and quantity you are getting. Let me speak from experience. I had crepes in Paris, France and they weren't as good as the one's I've had at Paris, Las Vegas. These are filling, tasty and leave such a lasting impression that I guarantee you will be back for more every time you visit Vegas!",

You'd think that the Paris Hotel would have a great place to get a nice dish of crepe, but like some of the fake shit on the Strip this wasn't the case.    The line was miles long and that got me excited.  I was thinking, \"Fuck.  All of these people can't be wrong.  They are waiting for a crepe in the Paris Hotel of all places.\"  Seating in this area is a bit of a reach because in the same vicinity lies a confectionery serving chocolate, the omnipresent buffet, and several high end restaurants.    The Toulouse was my crepe of choice.  I had to wait another 20 minutes or so because there was only 2 crepe makers (Some advice for the legion of owners of the Paris Hotel who might be reading this review. Make the place bigger, or move it to a different part of the resort).  Merde***.  This crap, um crepe was horrible.  The pancake part resembled a tortilla.  If I wanted Mexican, I could have gone elsewhere on the Strip.  The pizza like filing was like what a former co-worker described....gahbitch!!  One last note.....when one of the crap makers was making our crepes, some of the filing from the various crepes landed on her fingers.  Instead of wiping it off with a towel, she audibly and overtly slurped it away and proceeded to finish our crepes.........    I didn't know that culinary arts degrees were awarded from gumball machines.  ***Note:  Merde means 'shit' in French.",

Depending on the time of day, you might encounter an unfortunately long line.... and my only annoyance with this place is that they are painfully slow when they get busy.

The Napoleon crepe is amazing.... the lemon custard and the berries are so perfect together.

We both ordered the nutella crepe, which includes chocolate sauce and chantilly (a.k.a. whipped cream).  It was too much for either of us to finish for breakfast, so I think a crepe for breakfast could easily be shared.  They also offered several bottled beverages and hot, fresh beverages.  I enjoyed a Starbucks frappucino (coffee flavored) with my crepe, and it was a nice touch.  But then I needed water, after all that sweetness!

When I came back the next day they were understaffed and the guy making the crepes was moving ridiculously slowly, almost everyone was whining about it.  When I finally got my crepe I figured who cares about the 15 minute standing wait because it's worth it... It came out without the creme and I asked the cashier if they could put it on because they did earlier and she said no because it wasn't on the menu, which it wasn't.  So I don't know.  The first crepe was much better, the second one just had all the raw sugar and butter in one spot and it was too crispy in that area, honestly I didn't even enjoy eating that section but I was hungry.",

I loved the one with the ham and the Bechamel sauce. They have sweet and savory depending on what time of day it is.. ha ha. It doesn't matter what time of day it is, 'cause it is Vegas, and even if you are a stay-at-home mommy with two kids.. you can go to Vegas for a weekend and stay up all night long two nights in a row, partyin' like a RockStar and sustaining yourself on crepes and champagne.

I'm sad because the price of one individual crepe sky rocketed to $9.99 each compared to back then, they were like $7.99 :( I know, not a big difference, but two dollars can change a life you know.. ANYWAYS I can't believe that this place is hidden inside none other than Paris. It's right across from that long ass line for the buffet, but why wait when you could conveniently get it to go right? There are some ups and downs to the crepes though. I haven't tried all of it, but if you like something that tastes like potpourri, then get \"The Favorite\" which is I think #1 on the menu. It's a combination of random fruits which over powers the crepe itself. I honestly don't like it :( If you want something as a dessert, I suggest you get either the Nutella, Chocolate or Suzette. I know for sure that those are yummy, but I have yet to try the others, so if you want to be adventurous and try something else, then hell, go for it! :) My last comment for the evening is.. the Fruits De Mer, also shortly and casually known as \"Seafood Crepe\" -___-. It's awesome for seafood lovers though! It has scallops, mushrooms, shrimp, and mozarella. Doesn't sound good but it is! Nom nom nom",

SO GOOD.  wish i had time to go back and try the others!  do yourself a favor and try it already.",

    "text": "Best crepes in town. I came at an off time so the there was no wait! However the line gets long during peak eating times.  You walk up and order then you can watch them make it in front of you. Crepes are made to order. They have a menu of several savory and several sweet dessert crepes to choose from.   I got the crepe with shrimp, spinach and wild mushrooms with a herb butter sauce. It was delicious! The crepe is cooked perfectly then all the goodies are added. I have had the ham and cheese one in the past and it's very good too.   I have tried several of the dessert crepes in the past as well. I like them all. My only complaint is they do not use fresh berries if you order them, and can be overly sweet. They also do not use real whipped cream, but cool whip instead. I would be back here more often if they switched to real whipped cream.   I still think they are the best in town. I will be back!",

The last time we came here a year ago I did not have the greatest experience and prices were on the rise. However this weekend, I remembered why I liked it so much!  The line can be fairly long but it is worth the wait trust me. Be sure if you are traveling in a large group to get a table as soon as possible and just wait for your party. Seating can be tough.  To eat we ordered a few different crepes, I ordered the breakfast crepe. Inside was roasted turkey onion mozzarella cheese, outside bechamel sauce with avocado. Unfortunately, there was not nearly enough avocado it was a small slice there should be more. Next was a monte cristo exactly how it sounds and was delicious. Fresh fruit crepe was great as well nice sweet fruits with fabulous whipped cream! Lastly the roasted chicken crepe tasted just like a turkey pesto.  Overall we had a great expereince and I will continue coming back.",

They have sweet crepes (which I rarely eat) and savoury options (which I often eat). They also have lots of beverage options. This is a good family friendly option and is a good quick place for a meal. This is a convenient option and I'll never hesitate to recommend it as even if they do get lined up the line moves quickly and the food is reliably tasty. Sure it's not fancy or anything but it fills a craving and that's perfect for a trip to Vegas.",

When we landed my wife said lets check into the hotel and go to La Creperie. I said, don't you want to explore the Aria where we're staying? We've never been to the hotel. I'm told, take me to La Creperie right now this second! Yes dear..  Walking up to the window, the chef greets us.   How many I assist you? One Ham & Cheese Crepe please.  A few minutes later, his masterpiece is ready. My wife grabs a knife & fork, I know to sit back and let her take the reins. She takes a bite. She shakes her head. She's in the zone. I know I can proceed without getting shanked.  When I tell you this crepe is so light, so flavorful, so bangin', its too legit to quit. Made with the freshest ingredients, the ham & gruyere cheese crepe is our go to crepe spot when we're on vacation in Las Vegas.  La Creperie sells dessert crepes as well as savory crepes. I never had them. We keep getting the Ham & Gruyere cheese crepe the day we land.  Cheers!",

Since visiting the real deal in actual Paris, France, I thought it'd be a kick to visit Paris Las Vegas and see what was replicated from the original spot. While walking the casino, we passed by La Creperie and decided to see how it'll stack up with the crepes we tried in Paris.  We picked a sweet crepe (butter and sugar) and savory crepe (roasted chicken). There was limited seating nearby so I went to save a table while BF ordered. Since BF placed the order, he got to see the crepes being made. He was sad the crepe maker needed two gloved hands to flip the crepe, unlike the one-handed expertise we witnessed in Paris near the Tuileries Gardens. While both crepes were good, the sweet crepe tasted much better than the savory one. There's just something yummy about a simple crepe with some sugar and butter. However, the crepes in Vegas just don't compare to the ones we enjoyed in Paris, France.   Nevertheless, La Creperie is a viable option for some casual, quick dining while in Paris Las Vegas.",

    "text": "YUM!!!! So this is basically a fast food window for crepes. Next door to the shop is a nice little place you can sit and eat your delicious crepes. We went for lunch and had a wonderful meal - and one that was honestly too much food for 2 people. We got 1 savory and 1 sweet crepe and we could barely finish the sweet one (though we did it was so good).  ~ Caramelized Pear $10.25 caramelized pears, raisins, maple syrup, candied hazelnuts & chantilly cream. This was wonderful- sweet, warm, and the combination of soft pears and crunchy nuts was wonderful. One needs a tea or water to cut the sweetness after a while though. I think it would have been even better with peaches- which I seem to recall they used to have (I've been here before) but I'm not 100% sure on that. ~ Ham & Cheese $11.45 parisian ham, gruyere & bechamel sauce. WOWOWOWOW!! This was AMAZING! If you only have room for 1 crepe get this one. The meat  has a wonderfully smoky flavor and the gruyere is the perfect addition to the dish. The creamy and salty flavors mix well and leave you very full.   For roughly $20 you can be stuffed and spend the rest of your time walking it off in either the casino or the strip!",

The line was about 10 people long when I got on line and it took me 30 minutes to get to the counter and place my order. If that wasn't bad enough, I ordered 1 breakfast crepe and after standing waiting for my food for another 10 minutes, I saw that there were people who ordered after me getting their food before me, so I went up to the counter and asked what was going on. I was told that they lost my receipt so they couldn't make my food, they need me to show them the receipt so they can start to make it. WHAT?!?! I'm standing there for another 10 minutes less than 5 feet from the counter and you don't bother to tell me that you lost the receipt? Do you think I was just standing there for fun??  Either way, after that, the food was completely cold in the middle and overpriced on top of it. Don't go here, it's a joke.",

It hit the spot it was tasty but the ham was deli-like and the sauce was too thin -we ordered it on the side.   I think what bugged me the most was paying $4 for a tiny bottle of water-what a rip-off!   Food was done quickly but not sure I would go back. The last time I was there was like 8 yrs ago and I think quality has gone down for sure.",

Ended up getting my usual strawberry, whipped cream and Nutella crepe without the strawberries, and it cost La Creperie a star. Lucky for them, their crepes are absolutely fantastic. Though they are on the expensive side of the crepe scale, for Vegas, the prices seem fair.   The Nutella crepe I ordered was packed with Nutella, and served with a generous amount of whipped creme and a thick drizzle of chocolate. The pancake itself had a perfect flavor and texture. It was glorious. My girlfriend ordered a savory crepe filled with ham, cheese, and a variety of other goodies, and it too was wonderful.   Even if you're not staying at Paris, you should give this place a try.",

Unfortunately they changed their menu within the last year or two. (Last time I was here was 05/2013) They no longer have the Fruits de Mer (savoury seafood,mozzarella/ mushroom crepe w/ bechamel sauce). It has been replaced with a subpar shrimp scampi crepe. They also replaced their pear/walnut/almond/Chantilly cream crepe with a pear/hazlenut/maple syrup/golden raisin crepe. Also subpar....the flavors just don't go together as well as the former. The raisins are very overpowering. Not to mention the size of the crepes has shrank significantly as well, while the price has increased. :( I guess the consolation is that it is still entertaining to watch the crepe being made. :/  There used to always be a super long line, no matter what time of day. Last couple times I came during lunch (11-2ish), and there was only me and one or two other people. I sadly will probably never come back....unless they bring back the Fruits de Mer! That was the best crepe I have ever eaten! ^__^  Always the optimist, I will pass by next time and glance at the menu, fingers crossed hoping that they bring back the old menu...",

So I decided to go back and gamble until 7 A.M. since I was really hungry. (I do not recommend you continuing gambling once you have decided to stop haha). Once I get back at 7 they stated that still needed another 10 minutes to open. So I waited. Even though I was the second person in line it took 20 minutes for them to make two crepes which I though was more then it should've taken. I got the Nutella banana fosters crepe which was absolutely amazing! I would defenitly get it again next time if I stay at Paris. The reason for the 4 stars is due to the amount of time it took to make two crepes and them not opening when they promised it would be open.",

It's a special place for me, because on our first trip to Vegas very early on in our dating times, my now-fiance and I must have eaten like 6 crepes from here.  I think I've tried nearly everything on the menu that isn't meat-y.  The crepes are $9.99 and come in sweet and savory varieties -- we mostly go with the sweet -- my favorite is the peanut one, but strangely I don't order it much due to its richness.  My second favorite is the D'anjou pear one with walnuts.  The apple one is the most basic, and they all come with this yummy whipped cream on top that melts into the crepe -- we get it on the side to save my stomach from lactose issues.  The one savory one I've tried is the one with ratatoulle and egg... very tasty and fresh.  I love that all the crepes are made-to-order and generous.  The only downside is the seating.  Except for the one time we showed up shortly before it closed,  we literally have to circle the eating area to the left of this place to be able to sit our butts down the second someone leaves.  Otherwise, you'll have nowhere to sit and enjoy your yummy crepe.  Overall, a cheap snack or meal.",

You just saw Cher at Caesar's Palace and was wondering how a 63-year-old woman can have the body fat of a ten-year-old on a weight-gain program. As you come to realize you should go to bed with that question weighing heavily on your mind, you respond to a moment of weakness and come here.   It's open late, well late for me, not for Vegas. 11PM. It's fairly quiet at this hour with the faux-Paris hallway with only a smattering of drunken tourists. The main dining room is closed, so you just walk up to the kiosk and order. Jamie and I split a $8.99 \"Favorite\" which was all sort of berries hidden under a large folded crepe. Lot of whipped cream, powdered sugar and berry puree oozing all over it (see my photo). In other words, it hit the spot. We sat in the dining area adjacent to the place and were perfectly content to discuss whether Cher has ever ordered one of these.   CREPE - 3.5 stars...no great culinary art but it does satisfy a late-night sweet tooth  AMBIANCE - 3 stars...well, it's Paris...sorta  SERVICE - 3 stars...they're pretty much on autopilot at this hour so don't expect frills  TOTAL - 3 stars...so I was hungry at 11PM...so what?",

It's a small shop along their faux street where you order at a counter, wait for your food, then hope you can find seating. Our order was up in about 10 minutes and lucked out by grabbing a tiny table to eat at. Between the three of us (2 adults and a kid) 2 crepes were plenty filling.  St. Louis ($9.99) - imported ham and mozzarella and fresh basil with bechamel. The description mentioned imported ham. Maybe they meant imported from the local grocery store, because the ham didn't taste any better than what I get at Albertson's. The bechamel sauce was too thin and runny for my liking.  Toulouse ($9.99) - ground sausage, pepperoni, sauteed mushrooms, mozzarella, basil, topped with marinara. This was the better of the two that we ordered. Tasted just like a pizza. The marinara lacked the depth in flavor that would make it special, but was good enough to satisfy.  This might be a good place for a quick bite, but definitely not some place that I would seek out or ever crave. The portions are ridiculously large, so share.",

    "text": "Who doesn't love crepes? I'm always a sucker when walking past a crepe stand to order something, and so when I was walking through the Paris hotel in Vegas and saw this little stand, I had to try it.  Luckily I was with friends, so I got to try a few different kinds.  Every stand is a little different, and being that this stand is on a busy walk way in a busy hotel in Vegas, they tend to me more about speed than anything else. So don't expect mind blowing crepes here. But if you think of it as fast food rather than fancy French pastries, you should be fairly content.  The prosciutto, gruyere, & bechamel crepe was the clear winner for me. I love bechamel sauce when it's done right. This was not perfect, but for a fast food stand I thought it was better than I expected, and it paired great with the prosciutto and gruyere.  The spinach and artichoke with bacon and cheese was also really good. I generally have more of a salt tooth than a sweet tooth, so I wasn't surprised that I preferred the savory crepes over the dessert ones.   It's hard to screw up strawberry and chocolate crepes, and these were pretty good as well. But it's not real chocolate, it's Nutella. (I like Nutella, so this wasn't a bad thing, just not what I expected) But the strawberries were either over ripe or over cooked. Great strawberry crepes (in my opinion) have crisp strawberries laid in the crepes right before pulling it off the burner, so they are just starting to get warm, but not cooked.  Same thing with the chocolate banana. It had overly ripe or over cooked bananas with Nutella.   So in my opinion, it's a good fast food option for the favors crepes, but if you want dessert, look elsewhere.",

    "text": "Granted, I've really never had a bad crepe...and I think it would actually be hard to have a botched crepe that is completely horrible because crepes are SO. FRICKIN. GOOD!!!  But the crepe I had here was excellent!  The D'Anjou is a crepe filled with pears, candied walnuts, and almond paste with a caramel topping and lots of whipped cream.  Num!  Since we were staying in Paris, I brought it up to the room, but forgot to get it 'to go'.  So I just carried the plate up.  While leaving La Creparie, a lady saw my dish and, with a thick French accent, asked \"Excuse me, what kind of crepe is that?\"  I told her \"the D'Anjou crepe\" in what I thought was my best French accent.  She didn't understand me (what can I say?...I took Spanish in high school  :P), so I translated for her and told her it was \"the pear one\".  Then in the elevator on the way up to the room, a French family was going up to their room.  They were all eyeing my crepe and talking about it in French, then asked where I got it from.  I let them know it was just downstairs.  Thankfully, they didn't ask me what kind of crepe it was because I didn't want to have to say the name again.  Who knew there were so many French people who fly half way around the world to stay at the Paris Hotel and eat crepes?!?  But I did a lot of free advertising for La Creperie with that D'Anjou!  Downsides: Long wait?  Yes.  There's usually a line.   Overpriced?  Yes.  It's $10/crepe.  Pricey, I know.  But, it's Vegas.  Your paying for the atmosphere of enjoying a yummy Parisian snack along a sidewalk in Paris without having to pay for a plane ticket to Europe.  :)",

Their portions USED to be generous, I couldn't finish one crepe because it was stuffed so much, would have to take half of it home. So thats why I kept returning even though their coffee and hot chocolate is crap and their bottled drinks are, of course, ridiculously overpriced.  It changed for the worse. The other day I came here again, ordered the mixed berry crepe (used to be called a Favorite crepe, thats another thing - they got rid of the French names for the crepes and are now naming them by their toppings). What a huge disappointment - the crepe was folded into a triangle with only a pitiful serving of berries and sauce on top. They used to stuff the crepe with berries and fold it only in half. So I was mostly eating pancake rather than fruit. For $10.50, it's definitely not worth it. Not coming here again no matter how much of a dessert craving I have.",

The Napoleon: crepe filled with lemon curd?, blackberries, raspberries and perhaps blueberries topped with some whipped cream= holy shit that is good. An hour wait is an hour wait but those crepes are good. I would come here when it is not peak hours (I came around 11- was there till about 12:30) My peep got the Favorite and he said that was bomb as well. Maybe next time i will share and get a savory as well as a sweet crepe. Also Crepes are all $10, but they are huge and well worth it.. What is not worth it is their small coffee which is priced at $3. Buy your Crepe here and your coffee at the cafe next door. Iced Mochas are only $4 next door. Way better price.",

I ordered the Forestiere and added meat - it was good. The bechamel was better the other day than this morning. I also ordered the Du Soliel and the Berry one.

My gf was looking forward to trying this place and why not.... crepes are pretty tasty.  We shared our breakfast crepes and went half and half on an order of the St. Louis and the Du Soleil. We had asked for the bechamel sauce on the side so we could control how much sauce we got with each bite. Overall, it was just average and nothing outstanding. It was worth trying once but will probably check out some of the other breakfast places in the future.",

It's come to the point that I have to watch them make the crepe and observe each step to ensure I get what i want.  There are times when the crepes get too thick, sometimes too thin.  A lot of the workers there like many in the restaurant industry, believe that more is always better.  that rule does not hold True for savory crepes.  I don't need an overload of sodium to my diet, so you can keep the extra sauce off, and no need for extra seasoning either.  The same goes for sweet tooth's.  Piling on a mountain of whipped cream or berry sauce isn't going to make my taste buds jump w/ joy and I really don't want to frequent my orthodontist often.  When I do happen to get a good crepe, it's heavenly.  I'm not too big on savory crepes, but I'll grab a bite here and there off someone else's if they get it.  Call me a sweet guy, cuz it's always about the berries, or chocolate when it comes to these wonderful desserts.",

As a crepe place in the Paris hotel, I expected it to be awesome and it met my expectations! They have a good selection of dessert and savory crepes.  Crepes: 1) Nutella Crepe with Bananas - Very soft and delicious, but it was a little too sweet with the chocolate and the whipped cream. A crepe with nutella and fruit is enough.   <a href=\"http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/6fPQJq4f_yiq1NHn0fd11Q?select=Hc6LPpoACvPTE_457TUOPg\">yelp.com/biz_photos/6fPQ...</a>  2) Bayonne Crepe - Prosciutto, mozzarella, fresh basil, and bechamel. What to say... It had some of my favorite fresh ingredients except bechamel. I had no idea what the heck that was, but provided a good flavor.  <a href=\"http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/6fPQJq4f_yiq1NHn0fd11Q?select=ac9-kNlfYElhfxc5TxW--g\">yelp.com/biz_photos/6fPQ...</a>  Don't go during peak times, because it can be difficult to find tables. You might end up having to take it back up to your room.",

    "text": "I ate here a few Monday's ago for breakfast with my girlfriend.  I had looked at the menu the night before and knew that I had to decide between a savory ham & cheese crepe and a more sweet blueberry lemon crepe.  That morning I was feeling savory and so I went over to find a seat in the seating area while my girlfriend did the ordering.  Due to that I don't really have much to say about the place itself since I did not see much of it.  My ham and cheese crepe came out to me looking nice and covered in a bechamel sauce which I mistook as cheese.  The crepe was pretty tasty as ham was good and salty which paired nicely with the Gruyere and it quickly disappeared from my plate.  Whenever my girlfriend had also finished her crepe we started talking about ordering a sweeter crepe for a dessert of sorts.  My girlfriend decided to spoil me and let me have both of the crepes that I had thought looked good the night before by deciding to split the blueberry lemon crepe with me.  She once again went over and ordered and came back with an amazing looking plate.  The crepe was in the center covered in a berry sauce, blueberries and powdered sugar with a Chantilly cream on the side.  In the middle of the crepe was some lemon curd which gave the dish some sourness that worked really well with everything else that was sweet on the plate to keep it from being too sweet.  In the end there was nothing left as we both had enjoyed our meal.  The bottom line for me is that I would stop by here again in the future.  While I believe that it is a bit overpriced to enjoy on a regular basis, the food is great and it could easily be a nice little treat every now and again.",

I'm so glad that La Creperie was so close to the hotel room elevator or else I probably wouldn't have found this amazing place in such a hurry. The seafood crepe that everyone was talking about is called Fruits De Mer which has shrimp, scallops, mushrooms, mozerella cheese, and fresh basil. It was sooooo delicious but they could've seasoned the seafood a little more. The plan was to go back to the hotel room, change clothes, and then eat it in the taxi but I ended up getting locked outside my hotel room so I ate it sitting outside my room as I waited for security to come let me in. I also ordered a Forestiere crepe, but I accidently left it in my room when I rushed to get in a taxi, so I didn't get to try it :(  The service is quick and the crepes will usually be ready in about 5-10 minutes. All their crepes (savory and dessert) are $9.99.",

I actually visited La Creperie twice during the week I was in Vegas, and got to try 3 different crepes by sharing with friends. I tried the fresh berry, caramel apple, and roasted chicken crepes. I highly recommend all three, but my favorite was the caramel apple. Oh my goodness... tart green apples with tons of gooey caramel... soooo yummy :) All crepes were about $10-12 dollars, and one of the days I visited they were running a special so I got a crepe and a fountain soda for $10- cheaper than the crepe alone!   Side note: This is one of the few locations in the shops that you will find a bathroom and open seating... take advantage.",

We settled on \"the crepe place\".    I ordered the tomato and mozzarella crepe which was covered with balsamic dressing. It was perfect. Either because it was really just that good or I was super hungry. My SO got the spinach and artichoke crepe. You really can't go wrong with spinach and artichoke. :). There is a line and they make each crepe so it can be a wait to receive your order.  Then you have to find a table to The second time I tried \"the crepe place\", it was around 2:30 pm and I wanted the spinach and artichoke crepe. It was a short line and the wait wasn't long at all. I took a bite of my crepe and the middle was cold!  Eww. The crepe itself was fresh and warm, but the insides were cold. I was disappointed and the line was long again. :( I do recommend this place if you just want something on the small side.  Make sure the middle is hot!  The Nutella crepe looked amazing but didn't get a chance to try it.",

I'm glad I tried it but I will be going back to 48th & Crepe in NY-NY (everyone should try it there, they STUFF your crepe. You really get your moneys worth!!! And they are AMAZING)",

The portion is big enough that I don't always finish it.  My favorite is the blueberry lemon, which is ironic because I don't generally like blueberries, but that lemon curd is OMG scrumptious!   Only downside is their setup: the line doesn't move very quickly because as you can see when you walk up, they have one cook and only a couple griddles.  It's also well inside the casino, near the buffet, so you have to really want this unless you're already at Paris/Bally's.",

The Breakfast is perfect for something savory, the Monte Cristo is a sweet/savory combo, and the Bananas Foster is great for dessert.

Waited in line, ordered a berry crepe, asked if they had ice cream that could be topped with the crepe, nope.   Also got a banana foster type crepe.  It took a little while for them to make the crepes, which is okay, since it's made to order.  The presentation of the crepes isn't that appealing.  Each crepe costs about $10.00.  My family got the savory crepe, I had a try at that, but even then it wasn't anything special, very loosely wrapped, everything falls out right when you cut into it.  The berry crepe needed to have more cream to cut into the tartness.  A scoop of vanilla ice cream would have been perfect. The banana foster ice cream was pretty good, buttery and caramel, soft bananas.  Overall, wasn't impressed with the price point, presentation and taste.",

Each is about $10 and they are very generous with the crepe filling and toppings. I usually get their savory crepes and they never disappoint. The ingredients are very fresh and I like that they don't make the crepe until you order so you know the crepe is also made fresh. The service is very fast and it is a very large crepe. They also have juices and coffee, everything you need for a quick brunch or bite to start off your day. Its not a formal restaurant so the only tricky thing is that it doesn't have formal seating. It shares the seating area with other eating places around the area so once in awhile it might be hard to find a seat but the few times I've been there I've never had a problem. I've gotten the mozzarella and prosciutto crepe, the shrimp and scallop crepe as well as the banana foster's crepe (the only dessert one I've tried) and they've all been good. I highly recommend this place!",

Freshly made crepes, both savory and sweet, are just what a girl needs to keep up her gambling strength.  My favorite is the Fruits de Mer crepe (seafood crepe).  Chunks and chunks of shrimp and scallops wrapped in an air light crepe, with a drizzle of cream sauce on top.  Heavenly.",

    "text": "We went to Paris to hit up the Le Buffet for the crepes but the line was about a mile long. Luckily there was La Creperie located exactly across from the buffet. The price of $10 per crepe will at first shock you, but then you have to realize 3 things ... 1. this is Vegas; 2. the crepes are HUGE; and, 3. the crepes are delicious!!! My hubby and I ordered one savory and one sweet crepe and decided to split them. For the savory we got the (forge the formal name of it) cheese and prosciutto crepe. I had never had a savory crepe before, just sweet ones in the real Paris. The crepes are a bit thicker than the real things but they are very very flavorful. After taking my first bite of the savory crepe, I couldn't believe I went this long in life without having one before. All I can say is .... OMG Yum!!!! This is not a crepe I would recommend trying to eat on your own. It is to be shared. It is huge and very very filling. The next was the sweet crepe. We were already full but there was no way I was going to let this go to waste. We ordered the crepe with cinnamon apple filling, topped with caramel and creme. And, when I say creme I mean to say C-R-E-M-E. It's a wallop of real whipped cream; maybe a bit too much. It also melts quickly so be sure to not order it at the same time as the savory crepe. Next time we'll get up and order it separately. Anyway, back to the crepe. Again, yummy goodness! I had never had a crepe with apples before. It was like apple pie hooked up with a Frenchman. Perfection! Even though we were stuffed, we licked our plate clean. This is a definite must-visit when stopping at Paris Las Vegas. I look forward to it in the future.  Add'l notes .... seating is a problem. This is not a restaurant. Seating is available next door to the crepe stand but on a busy day, it can be tough to find seating. Have one person stalk out a table while the other is in line getting the crepes. While the crepes run $10 a pop, soda is about $4 and it's for a small ... very small ... 16oz cup. The drink prices are not posted on the menu so it's a bit of a shock when they ring it up and you'll be too stunned to say anything. There is no kids menu so when a child orders a crepe, they'll be getting the same size as an adult. Be sure to share!",

The crepe was a little soggy and too thick for my liking. The raspberry sauce was too tangy I had to counteract it with whipped cream. I've had good raspberry sauce and a little tang is good, but this was too much. But maybe you'll have a better experience with a different crepe and maybe I would have given you a better review La Creperie if you had a better raspberry sauce and I didn't have to wait 40 minutes to be disappointed.",

I know there were a lot of people and she was rushing, but she was kind of sloppy and throwing them all together really quick. I think if she took her time a little more and put a little more love in making them, that they would actually be better. The best part about the crepes is the menu. You have sweet and savory options. I had the monte cristo.I would of liked more cheese that was melted, less turkey and ham, and a more flavorful bechemel sauce. I would of liked more powdered sugar and more micro basil. But, it was decent.",

Takes about seven minutes from order to plating. They'll pack it to-go if you want.  Some of these are crazy rich--my husband's cinnamon bun crepe was so sweet I just couldn't take a second bite.  Four stars and not five because:   A-the checkout staff were not very friendly; I dunno..I guess I just wanted them to be smiling and interact with us, but maybe after doing this day in and out, they get jaded..? Especially the cook wearing the huge poofy white chef's hat--he looked like a character you'd want to get a hello from.  B-there just isn't a large selection of crepes. I thought we'd go and see double the options...or maybe just a mix and match option..? I just now saw that their website suggests you add ice cream or other add-ins/mix-ups, but these items/options are not listed anywhere around the venue.   C-they used processed meats in some of these...my ham and cheese crepe had sliced lunch meat in it--for their prices, and for a place that calls itself \"French inspired\" I feel that actual ham should be used.  D-they really use brand name Nutella. There was a massive jar of it behind the counter. That disappoints me. Nutella is \"just ok\" to me..it is pure sugar. Why not try something like Justin's brand of hazelnut spread? It's different because of the lower sugar content. My grandma would say it's because we Americans are used to a crap ton of sugar.",

What I really didn't like about the place was the prices for the crepes. Expect to spend over $10 for each crepe, even if it's just the Nutella one!  I ended up getting the breakfast crepe and the crepes themselves tasted like a regular crepe with really nothing special added to them to make them stand out. To me spending over $10 isn't worth it at all. Now if the crepes were around $6-$7 then this place would probably be a 4-5 star review, but again you're paying for that premium price since the place is inside of the Paris hotel and would be more convenient for those staying at the hotel.",

My usual go to- savory: breakfast crepe & sweet: Nutella crepe. Toppings and overall quality of the crepe vary (I find longer lines usually equal lower quality). The prices appear to increase every time I visit, but it still remains a reasonable option if you're looking for something (that isn't pizza, sandwiches, or salad--check out jj's next door if that's more your taste). Seating nearby can also be hard to find during peak meal times & these crepes definitely require a fork and knife to enjoy.",

It didn't take more than 10 minutes for them to make it as there was a small line. Costs probably twice as much as we paid on the street in Paris. Definitely worth a try once.",

It's filling, tasty enough, quick and easy but it's not a place to go to go out of your way to get to.",

I get worried when they say marinated fruit, I assume it is that sugary goop you find in a bad pie. But no, this is fresh fruit tossed with a little sugar, not overly sweet. Usually comes with whipped cream but I skipped that part",

    "text": "La Creperie is my favorite spot in the Paris Hotel/Casino to get some French crepes.  I never forget to stop here when I'm in town.  I've tried crepes from other places and none have been authentic as the ones made here.  This spot is located near the Le Village Buffet and the pizzeria.  It's a small takeout stand and there are tables right next door to enjoy your crepes.    Just like any other popular spot in Vegas, the lines do get super long at certain times.  It usually moves fairly quickly.  Once you place your order, grab an open table otherwise seating is limited.    They have a variety of sweet and savory crepes.  These crepes are made fresh to order.  The fruit toppings are so fresh and sweet.  The crepes are paper thin and so delicious.  IMO these are as authentic as you can get in the states.    Our usual choices: one savory and one sweet crepe  ::::Shrimp scampi~so delish!  Shrimp in garlic butter and baby spinach and mushrooms.  If the sweet stuff is not your thing, this crepe will get you hooked.   :::::Nutella~for those with a sweet tooth!  So good. Filled with nutella and sliced bananas.  Topped with caramel sauce, powdered sugar and chantilly cream.  Add some fresh berries to balance out the sweetness.    I will continue to frequent La Creperie on my Vegas trips.  The crepes are tasty and legit!  Must try!",

The bad: it's hard to find, but any of the workers can help you with directions. Also, there's not a lot of seating available. My friend and I grabbed a table made for 6 people because that was all that was available. We would ask people standing around if they wanted to share the table, and they were grateful.

Or maybe you might have seen a show OR visited a museum and decided that a crepe is a healthy snack for the night.   This crepe stand can be hard to find if you don't know what you're looking for. It is a window shop with a tiny sign across from the buffet area.   Don't get me wrong, their crepes are good--but can be hit or miss. Sometimes, it depends if there is a lot of people. In a long line, they tend to be realllllly stingy on adding ingredients to your crepe. So far, I have only tried their dessert crepes and skipped on the savory ones. You can never go wrong with the Fresh Berry and Nutella crepes.   A good stop that will fill your craving, but not the best.",

Line moves fast and service is efficient on a typically uneventful day.   Due to the high volume of service, there is extremely limited seating in the food court area where one has to play musical chairs for seats. This brings down the overall experience.  If I was staying at Paris or Bally's (because properties are connected) I would rather take it back to my room & eat in peace but this defeats the purpose of eating on the go. Whatevs, you can plan accordingly to suit your schedule.  The ambience is loud, crowded and soul sucking (introvert's POV). If you watch how people jockey for seats you'll see what I mean.  Monte Cristo ($12.18 w/Tax): The best of both worlds.....savory and sweet, but mostly savory. Ham, turkey & Swiss cheese topped with strawberry sauce, powdered sugar & micro basil. It was good but not order again good.  Price point is high for what it is but typical due to location. Seats are also lacking, so not a repeat for me.",

Upon coming in the cashier was \"too busy\" talking to the cooks and was rather slow when waiting up front when they weren't even making a batch. Upon ordering she was okay, and their menu looks rather enticing with a wide range of savory and sweet crepe options. You basically order, it's made fresh, and you wait at the pick-up window. There is ample seating inside the shared common area of the Pizza/Bakery Cafe.   CREPE:  -*Breakfast*: roasted turkey, creamy eggs, avocado, pickled red onion, mozzarella, and bechamel   The *Breakfast Crepe* was pretty tasty and fresh! All the flavors came together with the bechamel sauce and the roasted turkey was delicious with the eggs and mozzarella. The avocado and red onion was a light touch on top.   For those that want basic coffee they offer that here and hand you the coffee cup where you fill it inside the adjacent JJ's Boulangerie, otherwise you have to go JJ's Boulangerie to order other specialty coffee drinks.   For the service 2 stars bummer on the weak service, and the tasty crepe is 4 stars!",

The most difficult thing is to choose what kind to have. The savory crepes are just as delicious as the sweet ones. This is a fairly inexpensive way to eat in Vegas, and since it's a casual seat-yourself setting, good for kids and a quick meal without having to pay tips or wait to be served. Did I mention these crepes are absurdly delicious?! My favorite - the Napoleon; lemon custard with berries. Now I'm hungry...",

They also mounded half of my plate with really heavy whipped cream, and although I'm biased because I only like whipped cream from starbucks, it was just bad whipped cream in general. The only good thing about this creperie is that for about $10, the huge crepe will fill you up, whether you get the dessert or savory crepe because they're both the same price there.",

I ordered the crepes suzette(oranges aplenty) and my gf ordred the favorite(strawberry and raspberry). Both were very tasty, should satisfy those with a sweet tooth. Keep in mind, if you order something with fruit, use the napkins as you might get hard-to-clean berries on your shirt or skirt, as my gf found out.  They didn't serve full coffee, which I think they should(lattes, mochas, etc.) to complete the crepes experience. My only real complaint is that the seating is limited and shared with the bakery next door. For the value, though, a great meal at roughly 20 bucks for two. A great place for a late breakfast, snack, or dessert!",

I had a savory crepe with prosciutto, basil, and that white sauce. the prosciutto was on the salty side but overall it was very yummy. The dough was a nice chewy texture. Also had the Napoleon which had berries, custard and whipped cream. Mmmmm custard in a sweet crepe is a must!  I came here because I remembered in from five years ago and wanted to see if it was still there. Lo and behold, it was in the exact same spot. Warning: long lines in the morning--don't even bother with trying to find good coffee. Also, people are animals about tables...I went to touch a coffee to see if it was still hot --meaning the person was claiming the table...and she came pouncing with a squeaky 'excuse me but thats mine'....well well well....i was just checking, don't freak out or anything! anyways, i was the table holder and set myself down as soon as a party of 8 left. it was a big family. =P  Prices were good for vegas we paid around $45 for 4 crepes. the sign says $8.99 per.",

If you want a get away from the endless buffets in Vegas, you have to try this place.  The only critique I have is that service was very slow, it took them 20+ minutes to get my crepes out.

That is ridiculous. I haven't been since.   My favorite savory crepe was one with seafood in a creamy white sauce. My favorite dessert one came with Nutella and I always added bananas. I don't think people know that you could customize your order.  I would of suggested this place when it was cheaper. Not sure if it's worth the two dollar raise in prices. Also, since it is just a window front, you have to look for your own table. That area is by the bathroom and it's always pack. So I don't think it's worth the effort paying the price you do and then having to stand around waiting for a table and most likely having to bus it yourself. The way they serve the crepes is on a plate and you definitely need a fork and knife. You can't just pick it up and go and eat it like an ice cream. Someone needs to open up a crepe place just like it, fix all the problems and I know they would make a killing.",

The prices were on the higher end so we were also hoping the taste would justify the cost.    My boyfriend ordered the St Louis and it was ok.  Just simple ham and mozzarella cheese in a crepe smothered in some type of white sauce.  I ordered the Fruits de la Mer and it was a little more tastier.  It consisted of shrimp, scallops, cheese and also smothered in a white sauce.    Finishing it off we ordered the Nutella savory crepe.  Now that was hella good!  It had nutella, whip cream, and drizzled in chocolate sauce.  If we weren't so full I would have ordered another one.  For the price that you pay, it's ok.  I would suggest to stick to the savory crepes.  I don't see going wrong with them as you may be disappointed with the others.",

There's always a decent line at this place, but they are very fast with getting the food out. Right next to it, there are plenty of tables and chairs to sit at and people watch. All the crepes were $9.99. They were a very decent size and filling for breakfast. First time we went, I had the crepe with spinach, mushroom, and cheese, topped with a bechamel sauce. It was awesome! My husband got a crepe Suzette, which he enjoyed.  Second time we went, we got the nutella crepe.  It was good, but it was almost too rich.  It was only nutella on the inside and topped with whipped cream.  Could have used maybe some fruit inside like strawberries or bananas to cut the sweetness.  We would definitely eat here again. It's also great for people that want to eat and run because you have a busy day ahead of you and don't want to wait forever to be served.",

Not even a crepe suzette! I had the D'Anjou - a pear, almond paste, caramel, whipped cream and walnut concoction  The pears were so-so and mixed with the paste, produced a not super flavorful milky juice that kinda grossed me out and the whipped cream was a bit \"cool whip\" tasting. I did manage to make it almost all the way through, however because the crepe itself was delicious.  My friend had the seafood crepe, which I got to when it was a little cold. It was buttery and I imagine very good warm, but the bechamel sauce on the top was a little floury.   I'd go again, but I'd order butter and sugar or strawberries.",

I have heard from reputable sources that French ppl are not the most gregarious of folk, but sheesh.  Would it kill ya to smile?  Third, our Napolean (lemon curd/berry) crepes needed more curd.  There was only a teaspoon or so of the curd which translates to too many naked, dry crepe bites.  Perhaps I should try the savoury crepes to compare?   Our crepes took longer than I thought to make, given the fact that there was no one else ordering anything.  Will I return?  Probably not.  Helas.  Le sigh.",

I could barely hear her, and since she wasn't looking at me, I couldn't tell if she was talking to me or the woman behind her making the crepe.  Whatever frustration I was feeling from the service, all went away when I took my crepe to a little table to enjoy (with my $4 bottle of water).    The good part is since you order your crepe from the little window, you are only dealing with the mediocre service for just a few minutes.  Then, you are left to enjoy the mouth-watering crepe.

    "text": "Being in San Diego, I don't really get that many opportunities to get good crepes so I always make an effort to stop by this place whenever I go to Las Vegas.  Crepes in Paris?  Seems idealistic, right?  The crepes here are a bit pricey but are well worth the money.  I usually come here after getting some sort of alcoholic drink served in a big plastic Eiffel Tower.  I've tried the Nutella crepe and the peanut butter crepe.  Both of which I consider are EXCELLENT.  The Nutella has a nice flavor to it.  The Nutella compliments the warm crepe will.  Top it off with whipped cream and this one is a winner.    The peanut butter crepe is probably my favorite of them all.  It's filled with peanut butter and banana.  The creaminess of the peanut butter coupled with the warm crepe makes for an excellent dessert.  It's definitely one of my favorite guilty pleasures when coming to Vegas.",

(which was AMAZING, who knew apples and chicken tasted so good) we had a fruit plate and croissants, sipped on hot chocolate while my grandma and sister drank mimosas. Once our guest arrived we placed our orders with our fabulous waitress and shortly after our food came. Don't remember what my grandma ordered but it was a delicious looking crepe. My sister had the healthy start crepe which she greatly enjoyed, It was a sweet crepe with yogurt, strawberries, bananas, toasted almonds and topped with honey(:  David our guest, had the croissant breakfast sandwich. I had the Belgium waffles with strawberries and cream, maple syrup, and nutella. It was phenomenal. I definitely recommend this place(: food was totally worth the wait, but some items on the menu were a wee pricey,  for example the fruit and cheese sampler was 10 bucks. Yikes!!  But nonetheless this place was amazing and I would highly recommend La Creperie to everyone(:",

However, I can see how the seating area would fill up quickly on a weekend.  La Creperie has both sweet and savory crepes, though not a large selection of either type. All crepes are $9.99 each plus tax. We ordered the \"Favorite Crepe\", which has blueberries, strawberries and raspberries in a raspberry coulis, and the \"Bananas Foster Crepe\", which has bananas sauteed in dark rum.   The crepes were served on a fairly flimsy plate, which was okay, but the plastic knife and forks were ridiculously small (the cheapest you can find, you know the ones I'm talking about). I'm okay with disposable utensils, but the ones at almost any fast food restaurant are better. Each crepe came with a generous scoop of whipped cream. I tasted both flavors, and they were both okay, but not great. Also, the crepes got cold rather quickly.  I might try this place again if someone recommended a better flavor and I brought my own fork.",

There was a line of people ordered crepes with all kind of filling. I ordered mozzarella tomato and it was very good. I also ordered grilled chicken with sun dried tomatoes to eat on the plane. Everyone was patiently waiting which was a good omen as any foody knows. The prices ranged between $8.95 and $11.95. The creperie is a tiny operation with a front person taking orders and two cooks. It is attached to much bigger bakery, the Boulangery. They  make fresh French bread , croissants, and tons of hot croissant-based sandwiches. Getting a table wasn't easy, but well worth total wait of about 20 minutes. Bon appetite!",

It tasted like the seafood was frozen, and the Bechamel sauce didn't have much flavor.  I had a bite of my friend's Toulouse, which had a marinara sauce, and that was much tastier.    I also got a cup of coffee here, and after a while, I noticed my cup was slowly leaking from the bottom.  They were nice enough to give me a fresh cup of coffee, which I then burned my tongue on.  =P  If you come here, go for the dessert crepes or the Toulouse.

Well the reason why I don't like the Bayonne is because the pork tasted funny and it was full of cheese. A little too much cheese for me. For $8.99, I'd rather just get something else like a slice of cheese pizza.   The person who took our order was kinda rude. (not to us, but to the people in front of us) The family in front of us doesn't speak English, so they didn't know how to order.

My wife loves crepes and most things french and my daughter needed to experience them.  We got a savory seafood crepe and a sweet nutella crepe.  Both were delicious.  The price may be a dollar higher than I would like but for the size of the crepes I think it is worth it. Plus you get free refill your own sodas at the pizza place next door.    There are not as many selections as I would hope and the line sometimes gets long.  The seating is first come first serve for both Pizza and Crepes and there is not very much of it so send someone from your group to vulture a table while you wait in line.

My husband and I made it a point to stop in and have a delicious crepe while visiting in Las Vegas. I don't know if that was this particular day or what it was but they were very expensive and definitely not worth the trouble we had to go through to have a HARD yet enormously chewy gummy unsatisfying crepe with berries and whipped cream. I have to say the berries were better than the crepe for sure. So if you want a handful of delicious berries you can find them here just exclude the crepe :(",

    "text": "C-R-E-P-E-S!!   One of my favorite places to go eat in Vegas is here!  I love crepes and this place satisfies my cravings.   When in need for good food quick, come here (only during the non rush hours and non-holidays week).  They don't have an actual restaurant.  La Creperie is a food stand that has a large kitchen.   It is located in Paris.  You order the food at the cashier and just wait for your number to be called.    My favorite crepes:  St. Louis ( prosciutto, cheese, basil with bechamel sauce) and the Napoleon (Lemon Custard with Raspberries, Blueberries, and Strawberries).  We also ordered one that had salsa on top, but I can't remember the name.  It was also really good.  Good crepe:  Toulouse.  It taste like a Calazone.   All the crepes cost about $8-10.  The portions are HUGE.  My 3 sisters and I shared 3 crepes.  It was very very filling!   Cons:  When you go during a holiday week, expect the wait to be LONG.  We went during Christmas week and it literally took us about 40 mins just to order and get the food.   However, when I ate here during a non-holiday week, I got the food instantly (10 mins).  Also, there is a seating area right next to the stand, but finding a table and chairs is INSANE!! Honestly, it's like a whole new world... you see the ugliest side of a person.  There's so much tension and hostility when people are looking for a table and chair.  My family was lucky enough to find a table but just trying to get one more chair took 20 minutes.  Also, while you're eating, you can feel and see people lurking at your table and ready to grab your table once you are done.  It's like a jungle.  *Survival of the Fittest!*  However, please remember that I went here during Christmas week.  Overall, I totally recommend this place!",

I think it is one of those must hit places when we come to Vegas. I have to thank my wife for that, she is the crepe connoisseur. They don't skimp out on the toppings, that is to say that even though we've been here several times, we only get the fresh berry crepe. I can't speak on any of the savory crepes, they have quite the menu, but for us it's fresh berries, or I believe we got Nutella and banana once, also very good. We like to walk over here and grab a crepe for dessert and walk around. If you like crepes, this isn't a bad choice! (Yelp LA Challenge #25 of 100)",

They gave a generous amount of Nutella & bananas (which was awesome!). However, there was no consistency on how they were spread out in the crepe. Half the crepe had a lot of Nutella and half didn't. I also thought the taste of the crepe itself was nothing special (it's something that I could make by myself at home). They also add these caramelized clusters of nuts, which was weird and hard to chew on. There's typically a lot of people so the wait can be a little long.  I say if you're really craving crepes in Vegas then this place could be worth it but there are definitely better crepes out there.",

All the crepes I had: ham and cheese, three cheese, and the pear crepe - were fantastic.  My only regret is that I didn't have more opportunity to try some of their other crepes, before coming home to a comparatively crepe-challenged area!",

Both the Breakfast Crepe and Strawberry Lemon Pound crepe was good.  Lemon pound cake bits was a little on the dry side, but the crepe itself was delicious.  Tip: Ask for cup to get water if you don't want to buy a drink.",

    "text": "As a person who is always on the lookout for new crepe spots, this one was a True disappointment. I actually yelped a crepe restaurant while we were on the strip and we purposely went to Paris only to go to La Creperie. You would think a crepe shop inside Paris hotel would be really pressured to perform up to a certain standard. All I can say was it was DEFINITELY not worth the price.   The crepes itself didn't stand out. Mine looked like it was literally thrown together. The whipped cream was sliding off the crepe and pretty much off the crepe and on the side by the time we sat down. The nutella was plopped on the crepe like as a splatter. The presentation was simply just ugly.   As for the service, I was appalled by how rude the lady was. I had asked if they had a crepe with strawberries and bananas, she said they could do the fresh berries with bananas. She then proceeded to tell me they charge for extra banana, which I was ok with. After getting my order however there were no banana. I asked her and she replied with \"oh you didn't order banana, you asked for nutella.\" I replied with an assuredness that I DID ask for banana and she continued to be rude saying I didn't. I couldn't believe it. So I walked away an unsatisfied customer.   Overall, never going back there.",

A quick bit that wasn't heavy.   The staff here was friendly. There was only one cashier and cook so there was a slight wait to order and to get the food.

The strawberry lemon cake was good, but a little too sweet for me, but it could have been because I was full and ready for bed. We did eat most of it. My sister in law got the buttery one and said it was really good. I will be back to try a few of the other ones.",

In the Nutella crepe, there was just globs of Nutella and did nothing to help with the sogginess. The bananas also tasted like they had been sitting out for a while because they tasted slightly turned.  I gave 3 stars because the Cannoli Cream crepe tasted very good.

They were very good and great tasting, just rich if you get one with cheese. Reasonably priced for Vegas and the size of the crepe. The setting is nice inside the Paris, and the service was ok.  The wait times were a little long, but we were there at a slower time, with 3-4 people waiting in front of us and it was about 15 minutes. I believe this is due to the size of the business, they make them fresh and there is only 1 person taking orders and 1 person making them. But is was worth the wait.",

Thank goodness there was no line, but we encountered a very unhappy guy, that was the manager at the time ... yikes!  I mean, no customer service skills at all.  No, Smiles, No, Hello, we asked about the different crepes and he told us to read the menu... uhmm really!? Idk, maybe he is having a bad day.. who knows!  I hope he will learn how to smile more next time.  As far as the food, it was just ok, nothing special.  We had the Banana Nutella with candied hazelnuts and caramel sauce, and a Nutella with fruits on top. Can't really say, \"Ooh lala\" hopefully next time when I visit they won't let us down.",

Then after you order, there are two chefs in the back trying to crank out all the orders.  It's great that the food is made-to-order, but with a backlog of about 10-15 orders, it took about 20-25 minutes for the food to come out.  The breakfast crepe comes with turkey, creamy eggs (they were kind of scrambled, kind of creamy), and mozzarella in a crepe topped off with bechamel sauce (a white, milky, creamy sauce) and some red onions and two small pieces of avocado.  If I had to pick again, I would try something else.    It seems like a good concept in Paris Casino, but I just wish it were faster.",

We waited 8 minutes for our crepes to be created.  They have a nice mix of savory and sweet crepes.  I went with the Monte Cristo and my daughter did the Blueberry & Lemon.  Both were very good, I think I would have like to have had a little more strawberry jam spread over my Monte Cristo, but some how I managed to survive.  There was plenty of seating around the area, but I could see on a busy morning you may want to think about taking these to go since seating would be limited.  If you get a soda you'll be going inside the bakery to get that filled, they do not fill it for you at the counter.  Over all I would recommend La Creperie, but just be forewarned your wait time might be different than mine.",

I had a hell of a time trying to cut the prosciutto.  My BF ordered a decent veggie crepe. Mushroom and spinach I think. This crepe was also doughy and thick. If it were not for this decent crepe I would give this place one star.  The coffee here is awful. I will never return.  Parking is a breeze usually and it's free. It's in the Paris parking structure.  When we got here it was not too busy but when we passed by later on it was really packed.

    "text": "I'm a huge fan of crepes, and after the Blue Man group, my girlfriend and I were very hungry. Since we were staying at Bally's we wanted something close and decided why not try a crepe?  It was interesting as this place doesn't stand out at all. It's like a little stand actually. If you don't look closely, you might miss it. It's located on the way to the Paris Casino. They have 3 savory and 3 sweet crepes from which to choose and they were all under 10 bucks. I think that's pretty good nowadays in Vegas.  We went with the Seafood Crepe which included Bechamel sauce, shrimp, scallops and spinach. It took about 10 minutes (they are all made fresh) and you can watch yours being made.   This was one of the best crepes I ever ate. Thick enough that it wasn't falling apart, fresh ingredients, and the Bechamel sauce was outstanding. We both felt this was the hidden gem of the trip.   Tip: There is seating between JJ's Boulangerie and Le Creperie so you don't have to stand to eat this wonderful creation.  If you like crepes and don't like spending a ton for them, this is the place.",

Would work great is not for the incredible slowness the staff today displayed. From the time I entered the line to order until I received my crepe, 30 minutes. When I did get it, they didn't have trays which isn't terrible except I still had all of my luggage since I was 20 minutes before 2 and I had a cup to fill my drink. So, 30 minutes for an overpriced crepe, poor service when they could obviously see I had a handful, and poor overall demeanor. Definitely a single star visit....",

Traveling from Texas and staying at the Paris Hotel, my girl friends and I decided to give it a try for breakfast one morning. I tried the breakfast crepe....and it was absolutely delicious!! It had creamy eggs inside a warm, rich crepe, just thick enough to not fall apart as you're eating it. The crepe was drenched in a bechamel sauce, that was so amazing I could probably drink it from a glass. It was around 11 or $12, so a little on the pricey side for a crepe, but it is definitely worth a try! It will also fill you up for a few hours.",

Presentation wise, \"The Favorite,\" was beautiful and looked delicious to eat, but like I mentioned, it was too tart and the crepe was overdone (as in crispy).  Totally disappointing.

    "text": "Yummy! I got the lemon blueberry crepe and it was delicious!  It was supposed to $11.75ish since I don't have a rewards card, but they had a special and you could get any crepe and a drink for only $10.99! What a steal!  Also, we only had to wait a couple of minutes, so that was a huge plus!",

    "text": "My friend, Deb N., recommended this walk-up window eatery to me while I was sojourning at Bally's. Bally's, for the uninitiated, is linked to the Paris hotel and casino by a charming \"pavilion\" of shops and eateries.  For the thousands of you who don't know me, my mother is Swedish. From Sweden. This means Swedish pancakes! Swedish pancakes are exactly the same thing as French crepes, but not as \"frenchified.\" So, I'm used to simple presentation and simple fillings.  I was eager to check it out, though. And I couldn't help but branch out (they didn't have a listing for a jelly-filled crepe...) so I ordered the Nutella Crepe. This was the hazelnut paste with a chocolatey goodness layered inside the crepes, while the whole thing was topped off by chocolate sauce, powdered sugar and a dollop of whipped cream.  Background: I had been congested and dreary, sans appetit, for 36 hours. Well, this plate of goodness cheered me right up! Zut alors!!! Sacre bleu!  It was yummy, potentially messy and I ate the whole thing.",
