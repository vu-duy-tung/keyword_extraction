The best part was the patio seating and our server, I think his name was Nate. It was a really cool atmosphere and his service was on point. He was really personable, not like your typical Robot server you generally get. After we finished our apps, the main course came right on queue. Seriously great service and overall experience. Two recommendations: 1- Whoever made the menu (food and drink), keep them! 2- Higher more people like Nate (phenomenal server)",

We had a reservation, but had to wait 30 minutes for our table. The hostess seemed very overwhelmed and forgot about us multiple times. She even asked my name multiple times to confirm the reservation. Once we were finally seated we ordered beer and water. It took 20 minutes to get our drinks. At that time we asked to put in our appetizer and dinner order to try and speed up the process (we were going to a hockey game and didn't want to be late). 45 minutes later we received our food. It was frustrating because others around us who ordered after us, ate and left before we even got our food. Some guests in our party never even received their food. We had to ask for the check and leave, because we were going to be late for the game. We asked our server to take the food we never received off of our bill. He was hesitant at first, but finally agreed. He argued with us, and then realized he made a mistake. We will stick to Shake Shack and Bruxie's from now on.",

Rolling into New York New York as I wait for my room to become available at the M Resort I check out Tom's Urban.  Upon hitting the place I grab a seat at the bar, crack down a cold brew from a local Las Vegas brewery and try the Duck Wings! Amazing taste.. not feeling to hunger to consume a big burger or something crazy these things do the job perfect! While I didn't try much more the food was great, my bar tender was very very attentive one of the best I ever met over the years (she was working Sat Jan 31st for staff that read's this) and all around the place was very cool.. I would def come back and check this place out again for a larger meal. Easy 4 star's all day.",

Over time I guess we have gone enough to the point where we are commonly recognized by Erron and out of the thousands that come to Vegas standing out in THAT crowd is priceless and certainly a genuine thing that one can't fake. We have made Tom's Urban an annual wedding anniversary meal and after the recent visit for our 8th year he came over personally and chatted it up while I'm sure he had a million things going on and that warmed the hearts of the both of us. As for Dylan, he certainly displays why he is in the position that he's in and I'd rate him 20 stars if I could. Hands down though the level of professionalism and overall hospitality from both of them personally and with an extension to the staff we have grown to know is mind blowing. This Tom's Urban is a VERY VERY special thing that NYNY has going!  It is Yelp however and how about we touch on some of the recent findings here shall we? Your taste buds will no doubt be your best friend if ya did!  Apparently with the check in now they offer either brussels sprouts or fried pickles which was new, but I highly recommend the brussels sprouts. It'll surely make Mama proud to see you eating your vegetables and LOVING it?!? Only in Vegas. Ha-ha! While the tenderness of the veggies were appreciated what really made it pop was the asian vinaigrette. There was a pinch of it being pampered in soy sauce almost, but then there is a sweetened after taste which is to die for.  Since it was my anniversary and all nothing screamed celebration more than their 16oz NYNY Strip. In a theoretical sense I wish I could've kissed the cook that night because the seasoning on that partnered with medium rare perfection was on point! It was just enough \"moo\" to coat the tummy happily, but not too much to miss out on their famous dessert menu.   Now speaking of that segway, I now have a guiltier than sin (no pun intended), their pineapple upside down cake. Even as I type this I can STILL taste it time and time again. By far this is the best I have ever had and I'm no doubt spoiled for life, but then again I haven't ordered one anywhere since and won't. Ha-ha. What knocks me upside the head is the moistness of the cake itself. Each bite melts away and crumbles in your mouth like golden chunks of heaven. What also gets me every time is the caramelized brown sugar. I literally have tuned out the noise of the restaurant and my wife even until I finish with the last bite. She just laughs, but I swear I could take a whole cake home. Is that offered, \"Tom\"?!?    I could go on for ages, but all good things must come to an end. I am very humble and places like these especially in the times we live in are rare finds. They have treated me well over the years dining with them and that genuine compassion is what keeps us coming back. Well yeah can't forget the ever evolving menu of deliciousness as well, but you know what I mean. Leaving with a smile and a full stomach is a job well done and a job they've perfected!",

    "text": "I had dinner with 2 friends (1 male, 1 female) last night at Tom's in NYNY. While the food was amazing, the server was terrible. While taking our drink order she addressed our male friend first, he politely said \"ladies first\" which she couldn't have cared less about. She took our drink order and when she returned for the meal order she addressed him first --- he again said \"NO, ladies first\" which seemed to now annoy her. Two of us had wrapped up eating but the third was still finishing her plate. Anny returned (without her apron on) and asked \"ready for the check?\" I replied \"no she is still finishing her meal\" not to mention she never even asked how we were doing!  She circled back again almost immediately after asking if we would like a box. At this point she's been rude, and rushing us -- we get the check and ask her to split it 3 ways on 3 cards. She returned and has 1 card charged and says \"I can't split it three ways it doesn't let me so I charged this one.\" 2 of us at the table have been in the service industry for awhile, we know this isn't True. I replied \"ask your manager for help, because you CAN split it\" she said \"but I already charged this card\" and I said \"then delete the transaction and do it again\".  This seemed to really aggravate her.  10-15min go by, we see a manager go back and forth. We see Anny servicing other tables. Finally she asks someone for help, and sure enough, She WAS able to split the checks. She drops them off at the table... and approx. 2 min later returns and says \"can I have the signed copies back plz\". We had not even picked up the pens yet!!  Clearly Anny had somewhere to be last night after she was cut. The food was great. I had the hot chicken and cornbread pancake, my friends had sliders and the jalapeno burger. More than happy with all of it! But the server made the experience miserable. Seeing as how lots of other people are trying to get server jobs on the strip. If you're not happy to be there and SERVE, then don't be.",

It was an enormous amount of food so the price to food ratio was well worth it. My friend ordered their salted caramel French toast and it was crazy delicious and was also a whopping portion. You could definitely split some of these meals if your not ridiculously hungry.  They had really amazing Blood Mary's and they had a wide variety of beers and ciders on tap. You can even do a flight if you like. Definitely check this place out if you want an affordable and trendy meal in Vegas.",

    "text": "Seriously - I don't know why we even did this again. I guess I'm an optimist lol ...  This was a visit that I truly wish had been skipped. Almost 10 minutes before a waiter came over to even greet us - then all down hill from there.   A buddy and myself just wanted some quality people watching with a bit of good food and drink- the people watching was ok. The food, drink and service were an average of less than mediocre, at best. The server had little clue about the menu and even denied having items that were on the menu when asked about them.  Lol it was so bad!   Initially, when we still assumed we might trust the person serving us ... we were directed to order a drink called \"Toms Cup\". This is how found that trusting that the waiter was a bad idea. The drink was gross. Imbalanced and overly sweet - it was just unappealing. Not his fault - but seeing as they were full when we finished the meal - it would have been appropriate for him to ask why they were two nearly full drinks.   We also ordered and fig and cheese sandwich which was the best thing we had - it was served with garlic fries that were almost sufficient. The pot stickers were bland, under cooked and overall boring. Please don't get them.  Neither of us could bring ourselves to complain because we were both in the service industry, and this was honestly just terrible - to an extent that we just wanted to leave and forget about it.   To top it all off - we were still trying to eat some of the food - mainly the garlic fries that were one of the most edible things - but I also asked for the bill so we could go. The waiter brought over the bill and began to stack the food plates - (THAT WE  WERE  STILL EATING OFF OF) - on top of one another, with food still on them.. Literally while we were both still chewing.   I said \"hey man\" we were still eating that. He said \"oh\" and proceeded to unstack the plates and give me the fries that were smashed underneath the other plates. I just looked at him. The guy truly was clueless.   So it was over $50 for two unfinished drinks, terrible pot stickers and a descent fig and cheese sandwich. I will never make this mistake again. There is no excuse for bad service and mediocre food - especially at this price point. It's not going to break the bank - but it's just a waste of everyone's time and money.   Happy eating to you!",

    "text": "WoW! What a different experience this was. After contact with on of the managers about my earlier review we decided tot give Tom's Urban a second change. Everybody deserves one, and we really want to like it. It's nice to see a new restaurant with Strip view in the neigbourhood of our hotel (The Signature).  We made reservations without any special request. Upon arrival (7PM) it was not very busy so we had a choice of tables: inside, at the bar or on the patio overlooking The Strip. No hard choice. Overlooking The Strip. For our standards it was a very nice evening to sit outside. And we're glad that since our first visit about 10 years ago the're much more terraces. Maybe not for July/August, but perfect in spring and autumn. Tom's Urban and the surrounding area are a big improvement.  Elizabeth made us feel right at home with some good suggestions on the eating and drinking menu. Also giving our visit a personal touch by telling us something about her passion (travelling) and here home state. Which we visited on a prior trip to the USA.  We ordered Duck Wings and Ginger Pot Stickers as an appetizer and The Chicken and NYNY Steak as entrees. With garlic fries on the Side.   The appetizers we're really nice. And if you order them: don't skip the salad under the Duck Wings. It's great! Not just decoration ;). And I even think we like Duck Wings more than the more obvious chicken.  Service was quick, friendly and genuine interested. The food was all sizzling hot upon arrival. The only thing you can say about the entrees is that the're no lady sizes. Pfff...I really digged in, but by the time I exploded I wasn't even halfway the plate.......We declined on the boxing offer. I know you've paid for it so it's yours, but we think it's not giving credits to the cook. Reheated is always less attractive and that will be your last experience, not the better earlier memory.  Biggest thing we regreted was that there was no room for dessert. And we really looked forward to the Cheesecake. Well, a good reason to return in September.  All together we had a great evening. Due to the nice food and drinks (try the pineapple cider!) and definitly because of Elizabeth. And looking around us we're not the only ones having a great evening. A lot of smiling faces around us. From staff members and guests.  We'll be back.  (Excuse any grammar or typing mistakes. I'm no native speaker).",

We got there with about 2 hours to go before the game so we thought we were ok.  Actually, we almost missed the start of the game.  Even though there were plenty of tables, it took awhile to get a seat.  Then the waiter passed us about 4 times and always said he'd be right with us.  Finally he took our order, 2 drinks, an appetizer and a sandwich.  At this point 30 minutes had passed.  It took another 20 to get the drinks and another 15 to get the food.    The food was good and so were the drinks.  Overpriced, but good.  After eating, we had to track down the waiter for our bill and then again to let him take it to process the payment.  Not once did he come back while we were eating to see if we wanted a drink refill or how the food was.   I know that it is Strip restaurant but that service was not acceptable to me.  I think because of the location it should be even better since there are so many places to choose from.    I don't think that we will be back there anytime soon.",

    "text": "My experience here was a disaster.  So here goes the story...  We saw this place walking around the strip and checked out menu and it looked good so for our last meal in LV we decided to go here. We were seated right away outside with a nice view which was great, well it went downhill from there. Our waiter came and my sister and I were deciding what to get in our omelet and apparently 5 seconds was longer than he wanted to wait because he just left.  He eventually came back and we ordered. My sister and I were going to share an omelet and sweet potato fries.  My son ordered the cheeseburger  with garlic fries and my mom ordered a coke and also sweet potato fries.  The waiter wrote this down and left.  We waited over 25 minutes for our food and when it came my son had sweet potato fries instead of garlic and they forgot mine.  We told the guy who brought the food and he said no problem he will take care of it.  We also asked him for an extra plate being that we were sharing.  We never saw this guy again.  He obviously had no intention of helping nor did he relay the message to our waiter.  So we had to track our waiter down and tell him the problem and asked for a plate.  Well, it took 2 more times and  over 10 minutes to get that plate.  Then our waiter brought my son his garlic fries and we told him we still had not received our sweet potato fries.  He gave us attitude then came back with more garlic fries. Seriously WTF.  We were so annoyed.  He finally got it right, but not without making sure we knew he was annoyed, but its not our fault he got the order wrong in the first place grr.  My mom never got her coke either he totally forgot.  The food was ok, our toast was cold when it arrived. I also forgot to mention my son wanted a milk shake, but he said the machine was broken and suggested we go next store to Shake Shack,  C'mon really--get it together  We really wanted this meal to be good seeing as it was our last one of our trip, but it was a disaster.  This waiter had no social skills and really sucked at his job.    On a positive note, my son said his food was good and the sweet potato fries were yummy.  Plus, the location is nice.  However, I would never go back after the experience we had.",

I really enjoyed sitting outside in the shaded area drinking hot coffee when it was 95 degrees by 9am (I'm serious). The waiter and those pancakes was what made us chose this place again.",

Our favorites were: Huevos Benedictos, BBQ chicken sliders, Lemon Blueberry poppyseed pancakes and the Tree Hugger Benedict. Everything was awesome - and those pancakes were the kicker! If you love lemon you will love these. Service was really good - everyone was nice and accommodating and the manager actually visited our table a couple of times. They even gave us some bottomless mimosas to go! I am definitely coming back here before I leave Vegas!!!  Came back a few days later and has Tina helping us this time. She was so awesome!! This time we ordered the breakfast BLT, Urban breakfast and an omelet with poblano peppers which was amazing. This place is honestly the real deal...I will be coming here every time I am in Vegas from now on!! Happy eating :)",

The price of the ticket gives you unlimited food at buffet to include: mini chicken, pulled pork, beef tacos, guac, chip and salsa, mac and cheese, mini burgers, wings, buffalo chicken sliders, tatertots, candy bar, s'mores, potstickers. Lots of food! We were greeted with gummy bear shots which were delicious! It was open bar, had a photo booth and we each got printed pictures, and seating!! Go to a crowded club for what???? They had a DJ here and it was an awesome time. The waitresses passed around champagne glasses at midnight smh everyone went on the patio to watch the fireworks! We really enjoyed ourselves! I put 4 stars because the bathroom line sucked!! It was one bathroom. They had a policy for using bathrooms in the hotel area but it wasn't the best. Either way the food was great, drinks awesome, service perfect. I would totally go to another NYE party here again. Oooh ok before I forget- the ages ranged from low 30s to about high 60s. It was a mature crowd that like to have fun and just enjoy the company of others!",

I chose the street bar, where the bartendress was WORKING HER ASS OFF, professionally serving customers while waiting for the relief bartender to appear! Most impressive.  I strongly encourage anyone wishing to visit the NY-NY side of the strip to target this place 4-5 PM..",

It looks good, but man. Maybe see a psyche about this? (I'm just saying had they served our lunch on palette boards, I would have understood.)  We had a great lunch here outdoors right on the strip. This is gastro food so don't expect much, but I would say for the dollars spent and the diversity of the menu, this is an above average strip restaurant. I definitely recommend if you're in the vicinity of New York New York and you don't want to eat indoors.",

I was eating sliders with a fork!   Sliders!   You know... those hand held bite size sandwiches?   I stubbornly ate the meat, but I kinda regretted that when all the salt and slime hit my gut.   No bueno.  However... I had a plan.   I saw a S'mores brownie/ cookie dessert that would save the day.   Right?   Wrong!   There isn't a brownie OR cookie to be found in there.   That dang thing (pictured) is a chocolate and marshmallow dip.   If I had made it for a party, people would dip their graham crackers, have two to three dips, and it would be a winner.   As a dessert, it is just a big pile of goo.   If you have read any of my other reviews I love love love my sweets, but this was just silly.  It was sweet, but in the way of squirtin Hershey's syrup straight into your mouth Sweet.   That's not a dessert.  That's a topping.    5 Stars for the location and staff 1 Star for the food",

I had the frog legs, which was a huge serving. Our server suggested trying a half and half order, where half were regular and half spicy.  Both were really good, but honestly I preferred the spicy.  I also highly recommend on the drink menu that you try the cactus ass kick.",

    "text": "Tom's is easily one of my favorite restaurants on the Strip.  I've been here 3 or 4 times now and their food is consistently delicious.   I have now tried the pork belly tacos, pulled pork sandwich, crispy brussels sprouts, and the Big @$$ Egg roll (pictured).  I would highly recommend any of these items. Their \"Cactus Ass Kick\" cocktail is yummy, sweet, and refreshing. Their outdoor patio seating is comfortable and not too loud. Most recently we went here to watch a Knights' away game.  We asked at the front if they would be showing it and the host confidently said yes. We came back a little while later just before the game started and the outside hostess was unsure if they would.  We sat down anyway and our waiter was happy to have someone turn on the game for us.  The service is, unfortunately, why I had to knock them down a star.  The patio was completely forgotten about and there was a time when we did not see our waiter for 45 minutes. Their pricing is fair for the amount of food that you get.  One thing I don't like is that most of their food comes with a side but many of the sides don't go with the food.  For example, the egg roll comes with a side but doesn't go with fries, tots, or even a side salad. Overall their atmosphere and food is fantastic, making Tom's a great place to hang out as well as eat.",

So we walked in and ordered a table. The guy in the front super friendly, our waitress very friendly and attentive. Very extensive menu, everything looked and sounded amazing so it was hard to choose. We opted to stay under the Breakfast/Brunch menu although the entire menu was open before 10am! Even the apple juice was served in awesome glasses. The fried pickles were very good, not greasy and fried to perfection (not burnt, not soggy). The only negative was the wait time. The restaurant was not full and it still took about 30min. The french toast was amazing- no need for syrup. The hash browns with melted cheese were really good too. I rarely leave food but it was a lot of food-needless to say big portions. Definitely recommend.",

This was a return prior to a concert at the T-Mobile Arena and since I had a large lunch, I opted to have just a dessert as a snack to finish the food day.  The greeter asked me if I wanted to go into the main dining area or just stay at the bar area along the walkway in NY NY Hotel & Casino.  I opted for the bar.  When I told the bar keep I was just having dessert, he gave me a menu and asked if he could get me something to drink.  Opting for ice water, I was soon given a large glass of very welcome coolness.  After looking at the limited dessert selections, I asked about the pineapple upside down cake.  He said that was their best seller and most liked dessert so that's what I ordered.  I enjoyed watching the tourists going by and within a fair amount of time, a server brought the cake.  It's a good tasting cake with fine pineapple flavor.  I don't think there's anything particularly special about it.  It's good and I might get it again.    Tom's Urban is in an enviable spot with the new arena and the Park.  There is a lot of traffic here and I can see myself coming back for dinner the next time I go to a show at the arena.  The bartender was a gem!  Personable and polite, he's a credit to Tom's Urban!",

We were mostly satisfied with the food but.........the service gets a zero! We had a reservation (which gives no option of inside or outside) We showed up and were told our reservation was inside. As I looked around the outside was empty..The hostess just stared at me as I asked to be seated outside..she said it was all reserved. So we were seated inside..(which is no fun at all) My husband decided to speak to someone else. He went back to hostess stand and spoke to another hostess who right away said \"sure I can move you outside\"...WTH!!! THAT 1ST HOSTESS JUST DIDN'T WANT TO ACCOMMODATE US OR WHAT?? So we moved outside and were happy until the grumpiest of all grumps was our waiter. I mean when you ask a person for there opinion of a dish they should have something to say other than..\"I dont even know you, how am I supposed to know what you would prefer.\" That answer just put me off. He was the worst with anything we asked. Even though food is great I probably will make this my last attempt here do to the stress of the staff and their attitudes.",

The decor is also kind of trying to hard to be hip but succeeds only in looking like a dusty 70s basement.   The service was great and the food was good. We went for the happy hour at 4 where they have a variety of bites available for only $4, which in Vegas is a steal. We got the tater toes with lemon mayo, potstickers and a mahi mahi taco. All $4 and all good. I honestly might have considered coming back here for something other than snacks if the music hadn't made me want to slash my wrists with the butter knife.   Maybe if I'm ever staying at New York again I'll try and sit outside on the patio and pray they aren't blasting the same awful music they are inside.

The hostess gals were super duper nice and I was able to snag a high top for brunch with my man.  They offer a nice check in deal and we took advantage of getting some friend pickles that were delicious little salt bombs of flavor.  They had some nice beers available and I ordered up the standard food of eggs, toast, and bacon.  We also indulged in one of those homemade pop tart pastries.  Not too shabby....",

Most eateries in NY NY were closed/closing so we would up here for a pleasant surprise. We did the fried pickles, brussel sprouts with the sprouts taking the appetizer winner medal. (Yelp gives FREE coupon for either, so check in upon arrival, unlike me) The Cubano followed up for entree duty on my visit, and was surprisingly really good. Liked the quantity of meat stuffed in the sandwich. Friends ordered burgers, which I assisted in devouring as well, and they were really good too. The shoe string french fries would be my only disappointment here. If they aren't crisp, and crunchy, meh.. Thanks but no thanks. Luckily tater tots of a dining companion saved the night. There is red, smokey, old bay type sauce that is served along as a french fry condiment that is the BOMB. Order this with your tater tots, and you'll be happy.",

    "text": "I've been to this Tom's urban location several times with my husband, both with ourselves, with friends, and with our children and grandma.  Location is at the NYNY, so it's very convenient if you are staying at that particular casino, but also easily accessible from the exterior as well.  Each time we have been here, the food and service do not fail to disappoint, although I can say that a few times the service has been exceptional.    My husband and I like the patio because of the coolness factor (both figurative and literal).  They have lots of misters, and on the hot days they are refreshing and not too overpowering.  Also, you are right on the strip, just inside the casino's replica of the Brooklyn Bridge.   This makes for great people watching, and at nighttime you have a nice view of the twinkling lights,  and sometimes a little live music from a local musician posted up nearby.  On our most recent visit it was super hot,  so we opted for a semi-patio seat, which was cool, too.  It was a little funny because they tried to sit five of us at a small table for four, but that was quickly remedied by putting two tables together.   Over the several visits at this Tom's Urban location I have had breakfast, dinner, and appetizers and enjoyed all three.  What is helpful is that the menu is very descriptive, so read it thoroughly and ask questions.  The servers and kitchen are happy to make slight accommodations.  I have tried quite a few items but one that stands out is a Mac and cheese / Chile Verde concoction.  Pretty legit mixture of the two dishes, including tender chunks of pork.  Super delicious and unique. Try it!  Last note:  they do not have a kids menu per se, but if you are like us with picky children, the All-American sliders are basically little burgers, and the have good-sized little pizzas.  Both were hits with our 7 and 8 year old.  We will be back for sure if and when we stay at the NYNY again!",

Ordered a chicken dish - waiter did not ask about side and just brought a random side- which was very good- but should ask what is wanted. Chicken was very good- $24 - so it should be. Regular fries come out instead of sweet potato fries. Burger ordered without cheese came with cheese- so that person did not get served at the same time because they had to redo.. So, overall there is a hiccup in the steps of ordering and serving what was ordered- which made the otherwise enjoyable dinner more administrative and instructive then it needs to be.",

Paid $3 extra to receive 6 more ounces of beer, part of which spilled out before he delivered to my table and two inches were missing from the glass. Ordered fries which were supposed to come with two sides of specialty ketchup, never came and had to ask for it. Asked our server as well as food deliverer for water (mind you its 90+ degrees), never got it and had to ask a third time. Ordered a second round of drinks and it took THIRTY minutes to get them. Once checks came of course our server was all over it trying to get the money on HIS time. Mind you, this is a Wednesday at noon that we sat down and this was a table of two. I work in tips and can not believe the lack of frequency to see how we were doing or if we needed anything - especially during slow hours.

Patio seemed full and very few tables in the restaurant at that early hour. After taking our drink order we didn't get them for about 15 min. Worry some. Turns out that was the last glitch of our evening.  We had 8 appetizers, enough for everyone to get at least a taste.  1. Colorado Calimari. Anaheim and Fresno chilis made it tasty. Calamari fried nicely. 2. Ginger Chicken pot stickers (5). These were very tasty and not dry with a sweet dipping sauce. 3.French Fries two ways: garlic fried and cinnamon sweet potatos. Not a fan of the spice on the sweet potato fries.  4.Mini Carnitas Mac n Cheese. My favorite dish. Carnitas shredded and cooked with the large spiral mac n cheese and green chilis. Baked in a small skillet and served bubbling hot.  5. Sticky Belly Steamed Buns. Steamed buns filled with sticky pork belly, Asian peanut slaw, cilantro, green onion. The buns were of good quality, well made. 6. Filet Mignon Sliders. (2). Tasty, tender meat, brioche bun, an asian peanut slaw with cilantro, and onion.  7. Al Carbon steak nachos. a HUGE plate of tortilla chips and lots of cheese with sliced Angus beef, pico de gallo, fresh jalapenos, sides of cilantro crema, sour cream and Guac. ( I could not find the guac?) 8. Buffalo Wings. (5) We had these but without the spices as we had sensitive some palettes. Wings fried perfectly served with a ranch sauce carrots and celery.  After the slow start the server was very attentive and we didn't feel rushed or harried.   Side note: the salad courses on the menu were huge and I would order the  Avocado Shrimp  Roasted chilled shrimp, baby spinach, chopped hard-boiled egg, tomato, cucumber, avocado, fried capers, remoulade dressing. 3.5 stars.",

It was a four egg omelet and came with hash browns and toast for 13.50. The omelet was cooked perfectly folded American style and they did not skip on the toppings. Each bite including the edges had bacon. The hash browns were the BEST hash browns I have ever had. They were crispy and not super greasy they were filled with a cheese that I forget the name of and I ate most of them before I realized how much I had eaten. I also received the wheat toast which came with preserves. Not sure if it is house made but it was absolutely delicious even the table next to ours was blown away. My girlfriend ordered the traditional breakfast which was 2 eggs, bacon or sausage, hash browns, and toast. I can't remember the price of hers. But she also ordered one pancake ala carte. The traditional breakfast for her was perfect same type of hash browns and the eggs were cooked with out being watery or over cooked. The bacon she ordered came out crisp and perfect. The pancake she got was the size of the plate and came with a salted caramel butter and warm maple syrup. I tried the salted caramel butter myself and was instantly a fan. I usually do not like caramel but this was balanced enough that the caramel flavor was not over powering.   The service we received from Nicole was wonderful she gave us a \"tour\" of the menu when we first arrived. And was always there when we needed her. We never had to ask for refills on anything. She even grabbed me more cream after my 3rd cup of coffee without me asking.   This place has become my new favorite in Vegas and will continue to return on any future trips. Wish I could give this place more stars.",

I decided to sit at the smaller bar that is almost a part of the casino. The actual restaurant is bigger than I thought it was and it looks like they have a nice seating area out on their patio which is right on the strip. I ordered the pork belly tacos as I read on yelp that they were a good choice. They were excellent, some of the best tacos I've ever had. I will definitely be back next time I'm in Vegas to get a second round of these yummy tacos and try some of the other dishes on their menu. The bartender told me this place had only been open for 2 weeks, and in my opinion they're doing a great job! Bartender was friendly and asked me about my trip without being annoying or overbearing. I didn't get a drink but my water was kept full the entire time, great and friendly service. This was my best dining experience during my trip to Vegas- would recommend and will definitely be back!",

Items consumed included cheeseburger sliders (incredibly juicy, usually at places those little patties are dried out because they're small but these had juice running down my arm.. no lie!).. the spicy fried chicken and cornbread pancake (delicious and definitely spicy).. figgy piggy (lovely combination).. honey bbq chicken sliders (yum).. ginger chicken potstickers (crisp on bottom, soft inside like it's supposed to be & great dipping sauce) and we finally tried some desserts: the pineapple upside down cake (delicious albeit small) and the ridiculously ENORMOUS brownie/cookie/s'mores dessert which was decadent over the top but a decent value for $10 (easily would serve 4 people).. service was absolutely fine by 5 different servers (we had 5 meals there) so not sure why I see so many issues on their YELP page about service. We never had to wait long for anything, water was promptly filled, managers stopped by to check in and make sure needs were met.  So, our 2016 visit wasn't a fluke. 5 stars for 5 different meals. The only thing that would be cool is a frequent diner discount. haha Looking forward to going back again next year if not sooner!",

My favorite was the pork belly taco based on the mingling of sweet and tangy flavors.  The pork belly was a little bit off putting visually but it is like a think cut bacon.    The taco I enjoyed the least was the shrimp and lobster.  The sauces and fixings on the taco were overpowering to the lobster and shrimp. They were too heavy.  The shrimp and lobster would have been lovely with just a little pico de gallo, perhaps a tiny amount of butter sauce and a squeeze of lemon.  I ended up picking out the lobster and leaving the rest of the taco.    Finally were surprised with a free birthday dessert.  We really enjoyed ourselves.  I wish we were able to return next week.",

I ordered a kale Ceaser Salad, thought it would be safe enough to order but Instead I received a plate of ice burg lettuce, 3 leaves of what appeared to be arugula, and no kale. Chicken was old like it was nucked it the microwave. I couldn't even chew it it was very dried out. I was hungry and angry!!  The waiter seemed shocked until I had her look at the chicken quality. The manager came out and was apologetic so it made it a little more tolerable having to wait for a redo of the salad. Everyone in my table completed their meal while I still waited for my salad. Finally got the salad, but still never saw the baby kale. My BF ordered, The lobster and shrimp macaroni. It was alright... not worth the price, tho. At the end the waitress apologize and offered a free dessert!! So all said and done, the service was a 3... food is a 1 star!!",

    "text": "Had a great meal here during out last visit to Las Vegas. We started with the Xiangxiang Crispy Duck wings and they were really great. Sweet with a little hit of heat and just the right amount of crunch. The serving was of four wings but they were large drumettes, not the mid-sections, like I somehow imaged they'd be. We were contemplating ordering the calamari and our server steered us away from them, saying they weren't all that great. Kudos for the honesty - you don't get that from waitstaff very often.   Next, we put in an order for the Butter Poached Lobster and Shrimp tacos. We had high hopes and weren't disappointed in the least. A chipotle aioli played great against a crema with cilantro and the seafood was cooked perfectly. The two of us hadn't eaten since breakfast and were starving and wanted to try one more thing, so we wrapped up with an order of Shrimp and Grits. Again, the shrimp were cooked perfectly. The grits were the right consistency, but were a little underseasoned - nothing a couple of grinds of sea salt couldn't rectify.  We're in Vegas three or four times a year and definitely plan to make Tom's Urban a regular stop. There are plenty of great places to eat in town, but this one not only has a fun, eclectic menu, but it's executed well.",

    "text": "What a pleasurable meal. Yelp check-in for free appetizer highly recommended. An interesting menu with some unique takes on some familiar items. Great appetizers, including the spicy edamame and charred brussell sprouts. Both great and a very good size. The signature chicken with the Nashville Hot treatment was tasty and fresh, but you might ask if they can spice it up a bit more if you really want the heat. The dipping sauces were very tasty and added a nice enhancement to the perfectly cooked tenders. Especially the green Chile ranch dip. We also tried the pork belly, banh mi style street tacos. All I can say is yum, yum, yum. The sauce and cole slaw used in the taco were real complements to the nice thick piece of pork belly in each one (3).  My only suggestion is that the tacos should be double wrapped in corn tortillas. One tortilla just didn't stand up to the fully stuffed and dressed taco core. Crazy, wide beer selection to boot. Enjoyed the casual atmosphere. Everyone looked like they were enjoying themselves. I highly recommend. Friendly and knowledgeable servers.",

They cooked the living hell out of my omelet, the hash browns and the toast which leached every last bit of flavor out the whole plate. The mimosa (which was $13) was maybe 8 ounces and I would estimate it was 7oz of orange juice and 1oz of champagne. My waitress came exactly 4 times, once to take my order, once to give me my order, once to take my debit card and once to return it to me (it was not busy). On the plus side, their bar area's decor was pretty cool and has a decent view.",

We went back today and ordered pancakes, tacos, hamburger and  meat lovers salad with flatbread- between the four of us. The meat lovers salad had very little chicken, ham and maybe a few crumbs of bacon.  No dressing or flatbread was brought with it and when I asked for the dressing and flatbread was rudely told they were out of flatbread. So, I asked for something else and was offered english muffins or sourdough. I choose sourdough and 15 minutes later was brought pita bread and the dressing.  The burger was literally raw and should have been medium, tacos were editable but not wonderful and the pancakes were okay. There are so many other great choices in Vegas that there is  no need to pay for mediocre food and rude service.",

We tried both of his recommendations and both were equally delicious. I had the filet mignon steak sliders, which had hollandaise sauce on top that really accented the very tender steak. My husband had the sin city burger and said it could easily be the best burger he's ever had. Smothered in BBQ sauce, topped with crispy onions, bacon, and fried egg. His burger came with sweet potato fries, with an amazing chipotle cinnamon rub and some kind of Jamaican jerk ketchup. Definitely not use to finding such great service on the strip with such great food to come with it. We will definitely be back and will be requesting Nathan again!!",

I'll also give credit where it is due and say that the garlic fries were pretty yummy. However, it is unlikely that we'll end up eating here again, especially with Shake Shack next door.",

I told them about it and they offered to move us after we were already done. Not very great service if you ask me. Get it to go",

We chose to sit inside seeing as it was 114 degrees out. The inside is big and very modern. The restaurant was very clean. Our waiter was a very nice guy, he was attentive but not bothersome. I got the Buffalo chicken sliders and the cheesy grits on the side. The person I was with got a prime rib sandwich with fries. My food was delicious. I will say that if you do not like extremely hot food, I would not get the Buffalo sliders. They were hot but very good. The cheesy grits........ delicious. I could just eat a huge bowl of those!!!  My co worker said that the prime rib sandwich was one of the best sandwiches in general he has ever had. Now on to dessert..... the pineapple upside down cake..... yum yum yum!!  I will definitely be back to this restaurant next time I am in Vegas!!",

This was so average and bland I'd rather eat at a fast food joint for breakfast.  The Treehugger has avocado and it was browning on the edges.  The hash browns were almost cold and had no flavor.  The only thing decent on our played was the cheesy grits.  For $15 a plate, I'd say stay away as there are much better options around.",

The food runner ran out pop tart that they offer and had a nasty bandaid on his finger. We had no silverware to eat our food so the table next to us gave us theirs. Rebecca didn't check back once we got out food and my French toast was raw. So I had to walk back to host stand to get a Manager. John (Manager) was nice. Got a new item- pulled pork. Frys were super stale and my guests ordered garlic frys and didn't get the right ones. Terrible service and then brought us the check with all items on it. Including my French toast and new item to replace that so then had to get the check corrected and they tried to \"make it all better\" by sending dessert... it didn't work guys. One waitress to another Rebecca was not personable or attentive at all. We are locals and WILL NOT be back.  To top it off- she brought the bill back with not only the \"free\" dessert on it, but it had 3 additional items we did not order on it. So I left the correct total cash and left. Worst service I've received in a very long time.",

Moved onto the mini mac and cheese.  Followed by the Buffalo Chicken Sliders. Thank you \"whatever deity you pray or not pray to\" for this food!! All delicious! The mac and cheese was hot and creamy. The sliders were perfect. Hot. Spicy hot. Just like I like them.   Tom's Urban never disappoints. From the food to the staff (Thanx Eddie!). Go!",

We changed our orders to accommodate what the waitress stated and waited. After 30 minutes we asked about our order and she said they were backed up. After 45 minutes the waitress came back and said our ticket was \"almost up\". At this point it was after 11:30 and the tables around us surprisingly enough were getting their orders. At this point I requested to speak to a manager and he immediately came up and apologized and stated he would take a discount from our check. 15 minutes later our food arrived, but from the 3 orders, all of them were cold. When finished the waitress informed us that our check had been taken care of by the manager. Also, while we were eating the table that was seated next to us that came in about 35 minutes after had a big fluffy omelette delivered. Needless to say we appreciated the waived bill and left. Definitely would recommend eating elsewhere.",

Pages were sticking together as if a sugary drink spilled all over it. The waitress was too quick for me to ask for another menu so I used my husband's. We were seating against a wall in the corner. Which was fine since we don't really mind. My orange juice came in a small glass with two stir straws as if it had alcohol in it. The stir straws,evidently, was also sticky. Interestingly, the chocolate milk was given in a tall glass. My husband got the urban pop tarts. Apple filling. I got the lemon poppy seed blueberry pancakes. It took 25 minutes for us to get our food. My husband's pastry pop tart was about the size of a piece of bread. He took one bite and it was cold. He had to flag the waitress's attention to inform her his food was cold. She took it back and he had to wait a bit longer. We started to eat my pancakes together which was very good. I was pleased with it. Three large pancakes with butter and side of maple syrup. I'm a big fan of lemon poppy seeds so I was happy we enjoyed something there. Shortly later, my husband got his pastry and it was definitely warm this time! I got to try it and it was delicious. It will not be filling if you are very hungry though.  They have large round seating which I thought would be great for groups and booths. They do have portable TV stands placed around the restaurant which I like but also made maneuvering around the restaurant a little tricky.",

    "text": "Good bar to watch a game in. If it's not crowded, the management will change any TV you want over to whatever game you want, which is all you really want in a sports bar.  Great selection of draft brews - the only downsides to this place are the astronomical prices for everything, which I guess is True almost anywhere on the Strip, so whattaya gonna do?  $8 for any decent beer in a 16 oz. glass.  Pro drinker tip:  There's a miniscule-to-zero discount on buying any draft beer in the 22 or 33 oz. glasses, so just buy the 16 oz.  Unless your waiter is really slow.  I found it offensive that a 90-minute Dogfish Head was priced at $13 for a 16-oz.  High prices on the Strip, fine, but that, sir, is OUTRAGEOUS!  I won't stand for it.  I had some duck wings to soak up my alcohol as well.  They were fine.  Tasted like chicken.  But bigger.",

We were a little upset because bar tables for a giant group of people wasn't great and we even had reservations.   I was a little hesitant about the food because of the Yelp rating and also because of the snafu with the bar top tables, but oh my lord the Nashville hot chicken was some of the best I've had outside of Music City! It is served with either fries or grits - I opted for grits and they needed salt but were tasty.  Others at my table got potstickers, fried pickles, brussels sprouts, and mojitos and everyone enjoyed their food. If you are staying at New York New York its worth checking out for a quick dinner before seeing the Cirque show.",

I have a photo for your viewing pleasure. The Brussel sprouts were barely seasoned and had shoots of raw red pepper on top.  It just felt poorly thought out and rushed.

    "text": "Just  wanted to update my previous review as we had a horrible experience last week while attending the Knights game here in Las Vegas. We had a similar (unfortunately worse than last year) experience as when we dined last year. We've come quite a few times since and had excellent experiences.   We came in last week on Tuesday. Upon entering, the bar had plenty of open seats so we grabbed a seat for some drinks and dinner before the game. We sat for over 15 mins and no one even acknowledged us. Then we got the attention of the bartender and said we are ready to order (mind you she had never even acknowledged us to begin with) she replied with a sigh, and said well as you can see I'm a little busy. We said no problem, got up, and went outside to try to get a seat there.  When we approached the hostess stand the hostess was flirting with the server (not to mention the table right behind them was trying to get the guys attention and he was ignoring them) we stood there a good 3-4 mins without them acknowledging us. We then said sorry to interrupt, we would like to see if you have a table available with a waiter that would be ready to take our order right away. She looks at the waiter and says \"up to you\" he replies \"will you guys be eating for a while, I'm off in 20 mins\"? ARE YOU KIDDING ME! My husband said, well we know what we want so it depends on how fast you can get it to us. He then proceeded to ask us \"soooo more or less than 20 mins\"? We shook our heads, and left.   We went next door and dined at the chicken and waffle place, and although it was fantastic, we certainly didn't get what we came  for which was a fun sports atmosphere to pre game, delicious food and drinks....  As a Retail Director I can't imagine this is your standard for your Las Vegas location.",

The crispy duck wings weren't at all crispy. Chewing on under cooked poultry skin is not a good time. The big ass egg roll was also under cooked and the sauce poured over it made it a flavorless plate of sogginess. The lobster boy was just ok. The shrimp and grits were probably the best dish to hit the table. There was quite a bit of shrimp, but the grits were under seasoned and tasted more of milk than corn. There are so many other options for good food on the strip that I won't go back.",

Then when we complained to management, our waitress came back and said she didn't appreciate us going to manager if something was wrong. First of all, even if something is wrong, you can't get mad at customers. You need to suck up to them. They discounted our bills and gave us free mimosas to go, but when my aunt walked past some staff, it seemed as if they were gossiping since they quickly scattered when she walked by. We didn't trust the free mimosas and quickly discarded them.  Nothing to see here folks.",

    "text": "One of my favorite things about this venue is that you can walk in right off the Strip. No need to step inside the casino and navigate your way through a maze of tourists and gamers before finding a cluster of restaurants buried deep inside. Here, there's plenty of seating both inside and outside, which makes for some good people-watching as you're slightly elevated from the Strip.  The menu consists of \"street favorites\" like tacos, sliders, burgers, and pizza. Perhaps the best value is their progressive happy hour, which starts out at low prices at 4pm and gradually rises on the hour; similarly, their late night happy hour goes in the reverse direction, increasing the discounts as closing time nears. For example, at 4pm, apps start at $4 while booze starts at $5, rising to $6 for apps and $7 for booze at 6pm until happy hour ends at 7pm. Here, the tacos are good bets, and from the regular menu, the sliders and burgers are quite good.  Service was fairly friendly and efficient, and best of all, there's a reasonably extensive selection of craft brews here. I enjoyed a 90 Minute DIPA from Dogfish Head and a Dragon's Milk stout from New Holland. Solid booze and solid, reasonably expensive (for a major Strip hotel) bites - that's enough to keep me happy. Best of all, it was a good way to use some food credits that came with my room at the Bellagio and were valid across all MGM properties.",

On the first night, we went Tom\"s Urban inside area to have dinner and that's the first time we met Yurnell. She was very pleasant and taken such good care of us! On the second night we went Toms urban again but this time we went to the outside area and there we met Yurnell again! So nice to see a familiar face. Although it was crazy busy, Yurnell make sure we get our drinks. We ordered Guinness,cocktails  and paid our drinks and had a good time but later I realize I had a crack on my glass, I understand sometimes these things happen.   Not a big deal so on my second order I just let her know. She apologize. Not her fault! But it's alright, right thing to do. Professional!   And when I ask for my check for the second bill, she said no worries it's on the house since there was a crack on it. Thank you Yurnell!   Later that evening, we asked her about where is fun to go out clubbing, she mention a lot of places and she was super friendly and answer our questions calmly although we kept asking for a lot of informations. It was a busy night and she managed to take care of us and all others at the bar!   This amazing evening is all thanks to Yurnell! She made our evening in Vegas such a great one! Whenever we go back to Vegas, I'm coming back to Tom\"s Urban and definitely staying in New York New York! Staff are friendly and we feel exactly how we should feel in Vegas! Welcoming & pleasant!! It's the little things that matters the most and Yurnell nail it!   Thank you from guests in England & California!   Such an incredible woman! Yurnell!!! THANK U!! We are definitely coming back to see you!",

The cons are that the drinks are drastically overpriced with no drink specials on weekends.  On yelp there was a free appetizer with check-in.  We checked-in and asked to use it and the server refused saying it was expired.  We had literally just opened the app and never been to Vegas before.  So there is no way we had it saved from another time.  The server said he would only give it to us if he saw my husband write a 5 star review highlighting the servers name.  Of course he did it so we could get our free appetizer but then immediately changed it because the server was such an arrogant jerk.   We spent $30 on 2 drinks that were unimpressive and a waste of good money.  I would not go back to this place since they clearly have very rude employees.",

The waitress was super sweet and explained the concept of the restaurant were items that are typically found on food trucks.  The restaurant has indoor and outdoor seating, and with the location and breeze outside we picked outside. There did seem to be some music compeition between Tom's Urban and the shake shack next door.  Thanks to Yelp, we got our choice of free fried pickles or brussel sprouts with our meal with a Yelp Check in. With a ten year old with us, fried pickles it was! They tasted pretty good for being free, but there were other starters that I would have picked over the pickles. They do not offer a Kid's Menu but the waitress automatically listed some suggestions of items on the menu as well as a grilled cheese which isn't listed. This seems to be an issue with other reviewers, but with our waitress it wasn't a problem. I order the Honey BBQ Chicken sliders, which comes with three sliders. I could only finish half of the plate, and my boyfriend and cousin took the rest.  My cousin ordered the honey bbq chicken wings which are his favorite food in the world so he gives this place ten stars. My boyfriend ordered the Tacos Al Carbon Street tacos. These are not your typical Tex-mex al carbon from Texas but he said they were interesting and then ate one of my sliders.  I really liked this place and our experience here!",

We finally decided on this place because they had a nice outdoor patio, so we could people watch. Plus, the menu was intriguing. We ordered several different items and most were really good.  Fried Pickles: these were good but the sauce that came with them really made them awesome.  Brussels Sprouts: these were good but they were too oily. Cheese Grits: these were my favorite - hot, ooey-gooey, and delicious.  Margherita Pizza: I didn't try this but my in-laws really liked it and devoured it. Treehugger Eggs Benedict: I didn't try this but my sister-in-law loved it. It had avocado instead of meat and came with hashbrowns. Apparently the hashbrowns were the best part.

    "text": "Came here for a late breakfast/early lunch on a Friday. We were told that there were no tables in the main area without reservation and were fine sitting at a booth by the bar. However when we looked inside there were plenty of empty tables.   The service wasn't too great. We initially had one waitress. But then her shift was over so another waiter took over. The food took forever to come out and there were mistakes on 2 of the orders so those had to be remade and the fries were cold. They were pretty nice about it and kept making sure we were okay after that.   The food was okay, nothing special. I had the create your own omelette with sausage, avocado and goat cheese. The hash browns that it came with were really good. My friend ordered the blueberry pop tart and it wasn't good. We ordered the frozen Moscow mule. I love Moscow mules, it's my favorite drink, so I was excited to try this version. I was disappointed, it was good but def not a mule. It tasted more like a margarita.  The menu has a lot of options and the descriptions were pretty cool because it was like a funny story. My friend enjoyed reading all of it like it was a book.",

I ordered over easy eggs and they were fully cooked - not a single bit of runny yolk. Hash browns are actually just a bucket of cheese with a few potatoes which they don't tell you at all on the menu. So if you don't eat cheese like me be sure to ask for one. Sent them back and they forgot, brought back out after everyone's food was totally done so I didn't even get to enjoy them. Toast needs butter! Dry as the desert. Final complaint is there are no turkey breakfast meats.",

    "text": "I really really wanted to love this place more. The menu looked amazing, it looked like a really cute hip new gastropub-esque place.  I went there for brunch with my roommate on a Sunday. That was my first mistake: going anywhere on a Sunday afternoon. I'm really not a football fan and toms urban is right next to the NY NY sports book so of course the rowdy fans trickle into the bar to get drinks and scream at the TV over men in spandex. I just don't get football fans and I couldn't escape the game. It was on every TV in the restaurant and I think there were at least ten big screens. Anyway- The staff was nice enough but the service wasn't really that great. It wasn't that busy and it took five minutes for our server to even greet us and about ten minutes for my bloody to get to me (I was sitting right by the bar). The server forgot our napkins which wasn't a big deal but it's something worth noting when the GM had to fetch us napkins instead of our server.  On top of the staff being sort of inattentive they only serve bottomless mimosas till 1 pm, and after that a mimosa is $13. I know it's the strip but $13 for a single mimosa? A glass of champagne was between $6-$8 so why the extra 7 dollars just to add a splash of juice?? It seemed very strange to me. While on the topic of drinks they do have a lot of beers on tap, some of them local which impressed me. Always gotta support your local breweries!  The menu as mentioned earlier is spectacular. They have all day breakfast, small plates, and entrees. I ended up getting the green chile carnitas Mac & cheese pot with crispy Brussels sprouts. The Mac and cheese was so good, cheesy without being too rich. And the carnitas was very tender and flavorful. The Brussels had a balsamic glaze and were excellent. I'm so glad to see Brussels coming back in popularity. My roommate ordered the pickle brine fried chicken with garlic shoestring fries. I would say it's the best friend chicken I've ever next to blue ribbon fried chicken. The pickle brine was perfect and the green chile remoulade was excellent for dipping.  I would probably come back here again if a friend wanted to go with me, but definitely NOT on any Sunday's between now and February.",

It was actually cold!!   I had eggs Benedict and the ham was not heated in any way.   Told the manager.  Janet's was room temperature but we are starved. She ate.  Mine went back. I never send back. Let's see if I'm charged and more importantly, how it tastes. Waiting for coffee and food. Been here 40 minutes so far.  Lol. It came out over cooked. Muffin not toasted See photos! Now 50 min here.

This restaurant was clean, quick and great service. They were playing great music and good sports channels. It's the perfect setting for a great time.  Our server Michael, may possibly be the best server of the year. He was patient and a great food advisor. He has recommended the eats and don't eats, which made of choosing from the elaborate menu so easy. It is very well appreciated when service attempts to give each and every individual the best experience at that establishment.  My choice of meal was the Korean BBQ burger. It a was mouthwatering, plentiful, delicious, and original. The burger was perfectly prepared with fresh toppings and a perfect height to width ratio. The meal comes with a side of garlic shoestring fries or sweet potato fries. This is a meal to grant a return visit. It's simply amazing.  My experience in this establishment is great and can only hope that more people can experience the same feeling I have. I'm saddened that it is not available in Toronto. However, first pits in Vegas in the future would be Toms Urban.",

First impression was that it was a really slow night there so we figured we'd be in and out quick, we ordered at 11 p.m. on a Thursday night. The bar was more happening than the restaurant. We wound up waitng almost an hour for our food (burger plus a mac and cheese) that my wife wanted. The burger was cooked wrong and was sent back. I ordered it medium rare and they messed it up twice. The loaded French fries were cold at room temperature. 2nd time it tool them almost 20 mins to get me the second burger. We got tired of waiting for everything from refills to our food. This is honestly the worst service and food I ever tried....at least we didnt have to pay for the burger is all I can say was good about this.. They need to be more efficient and cook things as ordered. .. Thanks",

Both were good even though I'm not a fan of apple turnover (initially it was suppose to be cherry). The trial by fire omelette is actually spicy. I don't always believe restaurant when they say it is spicy but this one was on point. My partner ordered the chicken and corn bread pancake. It was also good. Finished the meal with the s'mores dessert. Do not order if you are only a table of two. You will need at least 8 people. It was good but very very rich.",

My fiance and I came here after taking a hot air balloon ride because he had heard at his conference that this place had a really good breakfast. We get seated and 10-15 minutes goes by before anyone comes by. The waiter who came by dropped of silverware and said he'd be back, which he never was, we got a waitress instead. We order, and again 5 minutes goes by before we get coffee.  Food arrives, we eat, and it's really nothing special. My BLT breakfast sandwich and hashbrowns was not worth the 15 dollars, but my fiance seemed to enjoy his chicken and cornbread pancake. Needless to say, for the money I paid I'm not impressed and most likely won't be back.",

The decor is cute, and the menu descriptions are very funny. I ordered the eggs Benedict (which by the way I am on a worldwide quest to find my fave eggs Bennie) Finally arrived at my table and there were the following issues: 1. Tomatoes were atop my eggs Benedict which I have never seen before and I hate tomatoes so I had to scrape them off which in turn scraped off the hollandaise sauce so I had to ask for another side of sauce.  2. I said sauce was lumpy which is kind of hard to understand because the hollandaise sauce is just a cream sauce. The sauce itself lacked flavor 3. I cut into my first half of the Benedict and the egg was darn near cooked all the way through. There was no run to the egg and completely over poached.  4. The ham was fine  5. The English Muffin was over done. Crusty outside then extremely chewy.   I expect a lot out of my eggs Bennie and I got a lot of nothing from this order. I was rather disappointed. They could see that I wasn't enjoying it and did not ask if something was wrong or if they could do anything else. I just pushed it around my plate and told them to take it away.",

I think everything was overpriced, but honestly, it's vegas - i get it.  the one thing that saved this restaurant was the blueberry poptarts. those actually tasted amazing. also, it didn't help that the service was horrible. from the hosts trying to find us seats (even though the whole place was practically empty) to finally getting a server to even get some water, it was overall a non pleasant visit.",

Lobster tacos, chimichurri skirt steak,mahi, mahi tacos, 2 orders  of brined Toms chicken (regular and Nashville spice), a cheese pizza for the young one., charred Brussel sprouts and Crispy Duck wings too and we all shared a layered  Chocolate  cake. The steak came out a little to well done, however,  the Manager Jose was so attentive,he quickly rectified  any issues with regard to the \"doneness meter\" and bam....a new order was on the table. The skinny fries were a big hit too. The Price.....one of the best around... you get your money's  worth. And it doesn't  break the bank. Overall , I loved this place....

I was elated to hear they served the full menu so I ordered the taco sampler.  When the food arrived it was not only visually stunning but the taste was so FRESH.  There was one of each of the tacos:  1.  Lobster - delicious! 2.  Carnitas - great flavor and tender. 3.  Steak - good flavor (not my favorite though - kinda typical) 4.  Chicken - good char on the chicken and seasoned really well. 5.  Pork Belly - the clear winner - WOW what flavor!!  Great service as well.  Tom's is a great find!",

I ordered a goat cheese salad with grilled chicken. The salad was described as delicious or \"you'll be so glad you ordered this\" or something to that effect. The salad was a bunch of arugula with cold chunks of chicken breast on top. No dressing aside from a splattering of oil. Not good. My husband ordered wings, and asked for no greens on the wings or the plate. The wings came with coleslaw and covered with chives. The women's washroom was single use only for such a large space.

A table of 8-10 people that got sat after my smaller group ended up getting their food before we did. When the server finally came back out of hiding and brought us our food, I noticed the buns on my sliders were rock solid. The garlic fries I ordered were COLD and hard, so I obviously wanted to ask for a replacement batch, but the server once again did not come around until I was nearly done with all my sliders. When I got my replacement fries, I noticed they were not garlic fries, but instead were normal fries with a ridiculous amount of salt and pepper. I literally had to wipe the salt and pepper off each individual fry prior to eating. For the price of the menu items, I think anyone would expect better quality food and service. This place did not live up to any of its hype. There are plenty of other places to eat on the Strip... my suggestion would be to find a different place.",

Beyond the cool decor and deck I am not impressed and here's why: I ordered the hummus plate and kale romaine side salad. At first glance everything looked great until I realized every piece of baby kale was yellow, limp, and spotted. I never return food but there was no way I was paying for a salad only to pick half of the greens out. Kale looks like that after 2 weeks in the fridge - gross! The vegetable issues didn't stop there, unfortunately. Every piece of celery and carrot on my humans plate was dry, cracking, and had clearly been cut days ago and stored. Any good chef or kitchen manager knows if you cut celery and carrots in advance they need to be stored in water. Come on, Tom's Urban.   My wife did enjoy the flavors of her cornbread pancake and spicy fried chicken, but I wouldn't recommend trusting any of the fresh items at this restaurant as they seem to think it's ok to serve produce that should have been in the garbage weeks ago.",

    "text": "As our one and only day on the Strip I wanted to make sure that I tried new places.  This place was actually recommended to by friend by her friend.  So this restraunt is located on the Northern side of New York New York.  This restraunt has a beautiful outside seating area with a bar and the luxury of watching the people on the strip.  This time we decided on sitting inside only because it was a rather hot October day and we had walked from where we parked at Paris Las Vegas.  This is one recommendation I do have: since you will be walking all along the strip I suggest parking in a central location so that at the end of sightseeing you don't have to walk to the other end of the strip.  So for me a day my friends do the central location was at Paris Las Vegas.   As we sat inside I noticed that the booths in the middle of the restraunt were very unique.  They were full Booth seats that wrapped around the table with an opening at each end.  I thought this was a very cool concept.   Anywho onto what you've been waiting for, THE FOOD!!  OK so sometimes you really can't help what your tummy wants and you end up getting the slider cheeseburgers.  Which I will say are amazing!! The flavor of the meat with the melted cheese and toasted bun was basically burger heaven.  It does come with a choice of garlic fries and I'm sure something else buy once my tummy heard garlic fries there was no swaying it.  Now usually when I think garlic fries I think fries with garlic salt.  Oh no not these fries. I believe they took a garlic bath and came out perfectly seasoned which means no normal ketchup for these fried spuds yes friends I'm talking special seasoned ketchup. OK sorry drooled a bit lol Another thing that I would also like to say about this amazing place was that they have an open entrance which means kind of an open wall.  I mention this because during lunch we had some little birdy friends enter and hop around.  They were so cute. This is basically a higher end comfort food place with prices that won't kill your wallet and leave something for all the souvenirs.  Highly recommend trying this place it's amazing",

Our waiter was friendly and helpful but not really attentive. I'm pretty sure we had to ask for a drink refill.  Anyway, the food was good. It is a bit pricey even for the strip. I had the lobster sliders and polenta grits.  My grits were amazing! The sliders were good. Too much bread though. I pretty much left the entire second bun. My partner had the fried chicken. It was surprising because it's like chicken nuggets and I think it's just called fried chicken.   Oh, and a fireball milkshake. Can't really go wrong there! All in all 3.5 stars and nothing to complain about. Not sure I will go back though.",

    "text": "Six of us made reservations on 2/9/19 before a Knight's game.  We sat at our table for 14 minutes before anyone came.  Finally our server shows up and apologizes for the wait. He asks what he can get us.  My wife says we would all like waters to start so he leaves to go tell someone to bring us waters.    He shows back up about 4 minutes later and asks what we would like to eat.  We all give him our orders and he starts to walk away.  I tell him we would like to order drinks too.  So he then takes our drink orders.  He was very unorganized and was not in charge of the order process.  The music was so loud you could barely hear each other talk.  The waiter could not hear us and we could not hear him.  Others were looking around at the ceiling to see where the speakers were so they must have felt the same way.  A manager was standing around watching things but never visited any tables to see how things were.  He was oblivious to the music level.  The food took forever.  The waiter would come by and say it will be ready in 2 minutes. 10 minutes later he would come by and say he sees our food is almost ready...give him another 2 minutes.  10 minutes later he said I promise it will be 60 seconds more.  We finally got our food after a 35 minutes wait.  It took another 5 minutes to flag our waiter back down to get salt and pepper.  He brought over two salts and hurried away.  We could not get his attention again to bring us pepper.  We flagged another waitress down and finally got the pepper.  Dishes were not cleared, more drinks were not offered and in all the service had a lot to be desired....even for a small group of six.  The food was good, not great.  Prices seemed a little high but then again we were in a strip hotel.  The extremely loud music, long waits and poor service is enough to never come back.  We are season ticket holders to the Knights so it is a shame as this place is pretty convenient.  There are much better places in the NYNY.",

I wish I could pack it up and take it home with me as once you experience such a thing you wish you weren't on vacation and your taste buds could live there. The signature drinks were also very tasty and the list is at bit of overwhelming but everyone tried something different at the table and sampled each other's. I also enjoyed the staff as after we finished eating we lingered for a bit and didn't feel rushed. For the pickle fried chicken alone they have five stars.

The big issue was when the bill came and it looked like I was overcharged for my food.  I thought the $6 happy hour tacos meant that the 3 tacos that were normally $17, were $6.  What a deal!  Nope, I was wrong.  The tacos were $6 EACH, which is not a deal.  So when I called Eddie over, all he did was argue with me and tell me I was wrong and that if I wanted, he could charge me $18 instead of $17.  Huh?  Why would I want that?  Instead he just threw up his hands and said \"Fine! I'll pay for it then!  Is that what you want?\" and walked away.  Soooo as soon as he left, my friends explained to me what Eddie failed to do.  That they were $6 each on the menu.  Oh, shoot, ok!  So when he came back to basically throw the bill at us, I tried to apologize (even though he was rude and didn't deserve) and he wouldn't hear it. \"Nope, nope\" and walked away.  Good talk.  This meal could have gone one way had \"the customer is always right\" been Eddie's attitude.  Look, I used to be a server and of course the customer is wrong sometimes, but you have to leave them wanting to come back.  Unfortunately I won't be back and I won't recommend to my friends.",

It's a good location and patio is nice when the weather is warm-  to sit outside and people watch. The inside of the restaurant it cute too.   But the food is just so MEH. And I've been here  enough times to say that wholeheartedly. It's so underwhelming. We're had the steak nachos a million times. There's never any steak on them, the chips at the bottom are always dry. The pizzas look (and taste) like something I can make at home. The Kale Caesar is more like a romaine/ mixed green Caesar. Which is fine, but then specify that in the menu. Potstickers are  actually good though! I'm sure you get the point here and I don't need to list every item I've ever had. I think it's a bit overpriced for the quality of the food.   I will definitely say no to friends next time they suggest going here and will offer other places in the area that are wayyy better.   Ps. They do have bottomless mimosas which I need to try and I'm sure the food  will be better after that!",

It took about 15 minutes for our waiter to come by and take our drink orders after being seated by the hostess. Throughout our meal, our waiter was non-existent, only stopping by to drop off our food and the bill.  After debating on order something off the brunch menu (offered daily) and a burger/sandwich, I decided on the Banh Mi burger. Although the toppings were fresh, just because you add Asian slaw, jalapenos, cucumbers, pickled onions, and cilantro to a burger doesn't make it a Banh Mi burger. The burger patty itself was cooked as ordered, was juicy, and had lots of flavor. However, it tasted just like a regular burger. The patty was pretty thick, so I felt the toppings got lost. Jalapenos were fresh so the burger definitely had a nice kick to it. I enjoyed the brioche bun, which wasn't overly buttered. This was a good regular burger...just not what I was expecting for a Banh Mi burger. I thought the garlic fries were okay. They had way too much garlic for my liking.",

Their HH is reasonably priced if you want to catch a drink before the hockey game.  1/2 off anything that pours!  Also several appetizers at a discount.  I like the menu.  It has a range of comfort food and healthy meal choices.  My favorite healthy choice is the avocado shrimp salad.  The fried capers really bring out the flavor.  They have a great wing selection that includes sriracha, honey bbq, Nashville and duck (first place I have seen duck wings).  The pizza and sandwich selections are a great variety.  My two favorites are the cheese steak and the BLT lobster roll.  So when your walking down the strip or taking a break from the sports bet, check out Toms!",

My must-order Tom's Urban menu item is the Figgy Piggy (applewood smoked bacon, fontina, brie, havarti, Croatian fig jam on grilled sourdough). It's a grilled cheese with jam and bacon basically. The balance of flavors are perfect with the savory cheese and bacon and sweet jam. Delicious.   We also ordered: *fried pickles: tasty, but even better because they were free with a Yelp check-in!  *urban chopped salad (Baby kale, romaine, cabbage, avocado, bacon, ham, grilled chicken, edamame, cucumbers, tomatoes, goat cheese, green chile ranch, rosemary flatbread) - such a big portion! It was full of great ingredients & it was super tasty. I enjoyed the rosemary flatbread as well.   121/365",

When ordered our app, server asked if we use Yelp, we said yes, said if we checked in & gave him a 5 star review, he'd comp us our app.. lame over attempt to get a high review.   Ordered the prime rib dip, super greasy & unappetizing.  Husband had a salad which was decent.  Our take away - overpriced and underwhelming.  Too many other places in the strip to get a good sandwich. Won't be back.",

We had the fries two ways, (but they came out cold - sent back for a reheat) pot stickers, edamame, and brussel sprouts to start - all really good.  Dinner we had - Sin City burger, lobster/shrimp mac and cheese and a breakfast burrito.  No complaints on the food.  Waitress was a little ditzy and not all that we ordered came out as expected but nothing to write home about and not a reason not to go back.  Sh!t happens.  Big place, super cool decor and seating.

The jam on toast was perfect. The omelet was delicious would recommend to sharing omelet as it comes with hash browns and toast. Would have preferred no cheese in hash browns but it was something new. Price was reasonable, give it a shot you won't be disappointed.",

I do not throw the term racist out loosely as I have lived in a brown body and have encounter many situations and name calling. But never did I imagine to be transported back to a time of racist bigotry. I have ate at a Tom Urban's before in Los Angeles and during rush hour never experienced bad service. This waitress name is Kayla. I am be reading the situation wrong but when two white parties sit next to me at different times and have their orders/drinks taken while I wait for her to even acknowledge me is beyond me. Not only did I have to move to get better service but the entire rest of the evening that I spent their watching my Dodgers advance to the World Series, she would pass me by and would not look at my direction. It was clear that she knew that she purposely denied me service base on the color of my skin. I was un-bothered by her actions as I stated grew up a brown human in a world that is constantly trying to put us down. But for my girlfriend, this was her 1st racially experience and was outraged that things like this still happen. I hope the manager or GM reads my review regarding employees they hire.",

Still, they were able to seat us right away which was great after a day of travel.  Our waiter however was very slow, not very personable, and to be brutally honest, quite clueless.  For the menu... I was extremely disappointed to see that the only plant based options were sides like sweet potato fries and edamame. I think that it is very important for a restaurant to have at least one vegan option for those of us with dairy and meat sensitivities (or for those of us who also just don't want to consume animal products for ethical reasons). I ended up having a pizza. I got the truffle, portobello mushroom, and arugula pizza - it was pretty good but my stomach was most definitely not happy with me afterwards.",

Big portions.    I would suggest putting sliced pears in the grilled cheese.   I like that there were options for the side rather than just plain fries.    Service was decent.  I did have to ask for water refills and the aioli for my tater tots but it was a fun experience.   Oh and the music was rap and loud for 9am on a Monday morning.  Would've preferred different music. We weren't at a night club.    We will be back!! Want to try some other things.",

You can get charged $12 for an iced tea if you have two glass.  The kids liked the pop tart $6.95 and pancake (ask for kid's size).  It comes with one pancake instead of three for $6.95, where as the three is $11.95.    I had the traditional eggs with bacon, toast and home fries.  The kids ate all my home fries.  Tip:  Remember to ask what the favor of the pop tart is before ordering since it changes daily.    Also, if you are not fond of the sun shinning directly into your eyes, make sure you ask for a shaded area.  We were there when the sun was upcoming up on the east and my son could barely keep his eyes open since the sun was shining right at him.",

The owner, Tom came by and made us feel so welcome. He made some excellent recommendations. The Cheddar Avocado Mashies are sinfully delicious. The staff treated us like movie stars and really knew the menu like the back of their hands! We had such a great time at Tom's that we went back again the next day!

Hash Browns were covered in cheese and a little on the crispy side which were not my favorite. Service was pretty rough - coffee only refilled once and I had to flag down a waitress for my check. It wasn't busy at all the staff was just not that attentive.   Still not a bad place, but a little overpriced and eh service.",

    "text": "Tacos, nachos, sliders.. things that are always good no matter what. NOT HERE. 16 bucks per dish literally almost made me vomit after two bites of the \"Mahi mahi\" tacos. Tasted like frozen fish sticks out of the grocery store but half the size of a fish stick, like fish stick chicken nuggets, stuck in a dry tortilla with a few sprinkles of cabbage. Fake steak on the nachos, gross melted cheese. I'd much rather have the nachos you get from a high school basketball game then wonder what this was I stuck in my mouth. Sliders bun was like an old McDonald's bun. Everything here was fake. How can they call themselves a restaurant when they serve no real food. The worst food I can remember having. And I'm not exaggerating. This is literally like my first Yelp review. I often think about doing positive reviews when restaurants thrive in outstanding customer service and exquisite food but am to lazy to actually do it. I am simply making this review as a caution to everyone out there to not step foot in this restaurant. The atmosphere is fine, menu seems good and then you get your \"food\" and I'd rather just starve for 4 days.",

Has a great vibe when you first walk in. I had the lobster/shrimp mac and cheese... yum! Unfortunately, we had Ashley B. as our server.  She spent more time hanging out at the bar with her colleagues/boss than taking care of us.  Example,  we had finished our food and waited 5+ minutes for her to clear our plates and offer dessert. Yep... I wanted the pineapple upside down cake... I SUPER wanted this... she gave me the menu and went and sat at the bar again for 5ish minutes... I was so torked I changed my mind and left her a crap tip!  This is just an example of her attitude and behavior.  Now... I won't be back.",

Oyr servwr Tori was great. She moved us to another area no problem.  My dining companion had a bloody mary and the steak breakfast burrito (very tasty). Their drink didn't have enough ice in it and it was warm. My m'lady mimosa was good. We had a Brussels sprouts starter/side. If you've been to Roast in Detroit and had their Brussel sprouts, nothing else compares. I had the spicy crispy chicken and cornbread pancake. Chicken had good flavor, but pancake got cold quickly. The maple syrup on the side added a good sweetness. Would come back here again.",

I also mentioned that we were 7 girls and I was told that it would not effect the wait time. We were pretty happy to have finally found a restaurant that did not have and hour+ wait time so we gave it a try. Once we got there we were told that we might not be seated because we were 7 girls and they might not have a table for that many. I was pretty confused since I had just talked to that person on the phone. We did get seated after the manager helped set a table up for us. However, when we got our food the majority of us were not satisfied, but we also did not want to be rude and send it back. When the manager came over to ask us if everything was ok one of my friends explained to him what went wrong and he took care of us throughout the rest of our time there. Very nice manager and restaurant, but the service/food was not that great :(",

The flatbread on the humus selection first served was cold, tough and chewy.  We asked for a re-do of the flatbread and the result was great, the bread was warm, tasty and as it should have been in the first place.  The other disappointment was the fries two ways.  The regular fries with truffle oil were delicious, but the sweet potato fries were a disaster.  They were not hot, not crispy, and not tasty.  Fail.  The lobster sliders contained well prepared lobster salad, but the buns were almost a copy of the flatbread failure.  They tasted old and stale. This kitchen needs to do much better on the First try in order to retain business!!",

You should order \"She's My Niece\" (they changed the name but they shouldn't have) or \"WTF\" but really, they are probably all good. Also the sweet potato fries were nothing short of the best sweet potato fries I've ever eaten.   Beyond the food, I loved the atmosphere; it was casual and fun looking. The music was eclectic and fantastic, it was like having my iPod on shuffle back before streaming music.   And our waitress Davina, was quite entertaining and nice. The service at many places during CES was boring and not great, likely because it was busy, but this place - wonderful. She really made the experience.   I came in with reasonable expectations and was blown away.   It's great.",

Tom's Urban was across the street from our condo so it was a perfect location. We arrived and the hostess was this adorable gal whom I didn't catch the name of, but she was bubbly and fun. She sat us on the patio and brought us water. Our waitress arrived and took our drink order. She was able to give us recommendations on what the most popular drinks were or what she prefers. We got our first round of drinks, and my only complaint was that my bloody mary wasn't spicy enough. They didn't have a huge selection of hot sauces, but we made due. The bloody mary mix is house made and delicious. I ordered the traditional eggs benedict with the cheddar polenta grits. The grits were amazing. Super flavorful and creamy. The benedict was delicious and the eggs were poached to perfection. It was the perfect breakfast to start our day. We were all more than satisfied. The service and the food were both on point to our expectations, and I will most definitely visit on my next trip to Vegas.",

I am a Las Vegas resident, I will not bring any out of town visitors to this restaurant. One more thing, restrooms are \"one holers\", amazing for a restaurant of this size. Lines all the time.",

    "text": "I'm sorry to give Tom's Urban a poor review but honestly their food is mediocre at best and not worth the money. Skip this place and go to another restaurant right next door on the Strip. So sad because the patio has a great view of the strip but the food is pathetically pricey and unoriginal especially given what it is. Sadly, I have a gluten allergy and when I asked about their options, I had two choices. I opted for the grilled salmon mango salad and when they brought it to the table, I got a bland piece of salmon served with white leaf cabbage and cucumbers. That's it. Where's my mango? Clearly no flavor of any kind. So I asked if I could have some GF dressing plus a few spinach leaves & tomatoes. No dressing choices for me and they charged $2 for a super tiny portion of spinach. Just awful. If you're into deep fried, buttered, super salty, bland food drenched in sauce then maybe this place will strike your fancy. But in Vegas, come on.... You have to do better than that. Up your game and add some creative options so that others can enjoy tasty food too. Discover flavor in the kitchen and add some creativity to your food. Only way to survive in Vegas.",

Unfortunately not going to be giving them another chance after 3 tries. too bad since the food isn't bad but only had opportunity to try twice...",

This place is gorgeous and colorful and has a patio right on the strip. I'm glad shake shack was too packed to take us, otherwise, I wouldn't have popped my head in here. Menu is a standard $10-25 but can be more with a steak or drinks or what not. The food was great.  Mac & Cheese- this small plate isn't a small plate and it came piled with pico de gallo and shreaded meat. I've never had this twist on a mac & cheese before and not sure if I loved it. BUT I love the idea of it. On any other given day, I would order this as would anybody else. Who doesn't want a crack mac and cheese?  Shrimp po boy sliders- came with 3 of these babies. Same thing, I loved the concept. The shrimp was battered and fried and I prefer them grilled but It was still good.   The bourbon bloody mary- Was ok. 3 stars. It was more ice than blood mary and it was poorly garnished. And normally a bacon bloody mary comes with a strip of crispy bacon but this one didn't.   Anyhow, our waiter was super friendly, attentive, and asked if we needed a split check at the BEGINNING instead of the mess at the end. Greatly appreciated it.",

    "text": "Despite some rocky service and so-so food, I'm bumping this place up a star because I can see a lot of happy hour potential and I had one of the best mixed drinks ever!  I met a friend here for dinner and we were initially seated on the patio, but after no one acknowledged us within 15 minutes, we decided to move inside. Good thing we did, because we were promptly served and our waiter (Berin?) was fantastic.  My friend is vegetarian, which is part of the reason I selected Tom's Urban. They have a large vegetarian menu along with plenty of food for meat eaters like me. But we both stuck with the veggies, splitting spicy edamame ($6.50), a small kale Caesar salad ($4.50), a hummus duo ($9), and roasted Brussels sprouts ($6.50 on the menu, but free with a Yelp check-in!). Not a fan of the edamame, which was WAY too salty, and the salad and Brussels sprouts were pretty pedestrian. But the hummus duo was really flavorful and came with carrots and celery as well as pita chips, which was great for a low-carb eater like myself.  My friend nursed a pint of Stella Artois ($9.50), but I was Ubering home and decided to sample a few of their $14.50 mixed drinks. Started with a Mule Kick, which is basically a Moscow Mule, and ended with two Tai Chi Chai Teas, which I can only describe as Christmas in July. (Yeah, I know it's November as I write this...) This drink would be perfect on the patio on a hot Vegas day: a spicy mix of coconut water rum, lime juice, ginger, and bitters that's allegedly only 110 calories. Two was not enough, but my budget couldn't afford more. Just wish I had skipped the Mule and started with the Tea!  We were there on the weekend, so we didn't get to experience their progressive happy hour, but next time I'm in the area, I'll be back. Drink and food specials are from 4 to 7, and the prices rise every hour. I'm not sure if that Tai Chi Chai Tea is on the menu, but I could definitely do some damage if that's the case--and, if not, it's worth paying full price for that tasty concoction!",

Manger on duty was Daniella and another guy whose name I didn't catch. Just for reference in case anyone cares about the horrible service that we received.   We also went in for breakfast Saturday morning and had a server named Jerome. He was training someone and the trainee was wonderful but then he left and we were left with Jerome who was just rude. So we figured it was just one bad employee and decided to give this place another try for drinks at night. Then we met Antonio and he could get an award for worst server ever. So apparently Toms Urban does not have friendly servers. I don't understand the positive reviews here. Is Saturday just the day all the bad servers work? Anyhow after our experience with Antonio we left and went down the street to the bar Double Barrel and received EXCEPTIONAL service.",

    "text": "One of the best sandwiches ever! I'm in Vegas for a convention and staying at the MGM. I saw an ad for Tom's Urban on the Vegas channel at the hotel and decided to try it. I like to check out menus online before going to a new restaurant, so I arrived thinking I was going to order the lobster and shrimp mac and cheese, but the Philly prime rib dip sandwich jumped right off the menu just begging to be tried. Whew! What a great decision that was (although the mac and cheese may be just as amazing).   The prime rib beef was out of this world delicious, tender, juicy and full of flavor. It was served with a beef demi glace. It's thicker and richer than au jus typically served as a dip. I'd never heard of it, so I had to look it up:  Demi-glace is a rich brown sauce in French cuisine used by itself or as a base for other sauces. The term comes from the French word glace, which, used in reference to a sauce, means icing or glaze (Google is a magical thing).  For the side, I chose the lemon rosemary tots. Crispy tots served with a lemon rosemary aioli dip - genius! I gobbled those up even though I was already stuffed from eating just half of the sandwich! I'm a big eater and I was stuffed to near food coma status by the time I called it quits and I still had half a sandwich left!  Here's how good it was. I couldn't leave it on the plate, so I got a box while wondering what I was going to do with it since my hotel doesn't have a refrigerator and there was no way I would be able to finish it the same evening. The food was way too good to just throw away though, so I wandered around trying to find someone who looked hungry. I didn't want to offend anyone, but I couldn't imagine wasting that awesome sandwich. I finally found someone who reluctantly took it from me, but at least I didn't have to witness it going into the trash. I hope someone was able to enjoy the second half of the sandwich as much as I enjoyed the first (they were served cut in two pieces, so it's not like it was half eaten and not totally gross, right?).  Now I'm going to have to go back before I leave, because I still want to try that lobster shrimp mac & cheese!",

The patio seating would be better and I would request that next time - indoor seating needs some more life or vibe. The calamari appetizer dusted in cornmeal was excellent. My husband ordered the BLT Lobster Roll and it came with huge chunks of lobster meat. So good!  I had the butter poached lobster and shrimp street tacos which were not bad but just lacked flavor. We ordered the street corn on the side and it was delicious!  I would like to come back for brunch and give this place another try.",

Anyway yelpers, here's what you shouldn't order:   The fish in the fish taco was the driest I've literally ever had and although the slaw was tasty, I really should have thought better about ordering fish in the desert. Queso fundido appetizer came out with our entrees in the teeniest, tinyest dish with like one slice of melted cheese. That'd be fine had it been free but for $10+, it was absolutely absurd. Shrimp po boy sliders were okay in flavor (remoulade was on point!) but these were also quite dry thanks to the heavy-handed cornmeal breading.   The Bloody Mary was well balanced despite being a touch too salty for our taste. The location is great, the patio seating was lovely and the table next to us ordered breakfast which looked pretty good. I would possibly go back to try their breakfast offerings and/or sip drinks and people watch at the patio bar but definitely not for another lunch or dinner.",

Also got brussel sprouts.  Well, got back to our room and salad dressings were so spicy that she could not eat any of it, also the potsticker were not really steamed all the way.  They were really thick and chewy and had a gooey texture.  I had asked if we could get them fried but he said no.  Disappointed because it was a waste of time and money.",

She was attentive without being over-bearing and laid back without seeming like she didn't care. I would give her five stars. She helped custom make a beverage for me.  The atmosphere was nice. Not crowded - we were there on a Wednesday afternoon. There was a nice mix of music selections from various decades with cool videos as accompaniment. I like the open floor plan and decor.   The food was just okay. It was kind of non-descript and lacked flavor. I've been to farm to table restaurants that seemed to use seasoning that enhanced the natural freshness. The best item, to me, was the garlic french fries - which weren't all that garlic-y, in my opinion.  I'm glad I tried this place but I probably will not return. While the service and environment were enjoyable, I'm a foodie so I expect more in that area.",

We ordered brunch food and it was alll amazing. I got the Beach Bum omelette and it tasted so good. Heads up, the hash browns have cheese in them but they are so good.

Took a short walk across the sky bridge to New York New York and we're thrilled to have a truly delicious meal.   I had the bacon avocado burger which was both huge and scrumptious. Bacon was apple smoked and crisp, avocado was perfect, burger was delicious and the homemade brioche bun was to die for. Garlic fries were good - very thin and could have been a bit hotter but that's a quibble. Will definitely be back, especially for a late night meal.",

    "text": "I've visited this bar/restaurant twice now and have passed by several times when staying at New York New York Hotel and Casino.   My first visit was with a group of 12 people, I know, a very large party. Tom's Urban is a pretty large restaurant and there were tons of seats available but we weren't seated right away. I understand it was probably due to our group size, but we were completely content with sitting in the bar area. This was something we had to suggest before it was even an option. The vibe was fun, there are tons of TVs for sports and the food was delicious; however the service was okay. Maybe our group size was a little intimidating. We unfortunately didn't get checked on often or waters/drinks re-filled. Overall we had a great time - still cool place.   The second visit it was just my husband and I during Sunday brunch (12-2pm). It wasn't busy, many open tables and we were seated farthest from the televisions and bar. We felt like we could have easily been hidden or forgotten so we asked to sit a little closer into the restaurant for better views of the sports games and service (if needed). Unfortunately it seemed that they were incredibly understaffed because service was very slow. I felt really bad for the server and saw that she was working hard, where others in the audience just felt service was poor. We ordered a few small plates and overall enjoyed our time.   I rate this place three stars cause I think it has so much potential! Its so fun, good location, vibe, music and food. I just wish they staffed better to make the delivery and overall experience more memorable.",

Our food came out super quick which was odd to us and once we started eating, we then realized why it came out so fast. We ordered the burger medium and it came out well done so it was tough eating through it. Our fries with the burger were supposed to be garlic fries and they tasted like they were sitting underneath a heat lamp for a while because they were tough and not garlicky at all. The potstickers were super cold and the Brussel sprouts were supposed to have some vinaigrette on them and they were just plain crispy sprouts. After telling all this to the bartender, he was extremely apologetic and put in everything again to come out right. This time we waited way longer to get the food and just ate the new postickers that came out because we needed to get going.   The bartender was great but the food was horrible. I will not be returning back to this place and would not recommend it to anyone.",

I was just looking for a place that I could sit immediately, fortunately, it turned out to be a good spot.    I had the Beach Bum Omelet, it was quite good.  It needed salt, but the server brought some once I requested it.  I was sitting at the bar, not a table.  The coffee was fine, nothing special.  Hash browns and sourdough toast come with my omelet.  They were both fine, nothing special.  It took almost 30 minutes for my food to come out, wasn't particularly busy, so I don't really know what's up with that.  I liked the atmosphere, it didn't feel so much Vegas and felt more like a \"normal\" gastropub in another big city.  The service was good, especially to be at a bar setting at 11am.  I thought the price was actually fairly reasonable considering the location!",

Since I loved it so much the first time, we ordered the Prime Rib Philly Cheesesteak Dip.  This comes with your choice of sweet potato fries or garlic fries.  This sandwich did not disappoint.  Mounds of shaved prime rib were piled high with melted havarti cheese on a brioche roll.  Yum.  Although we also ordered the Hot One Pizza, the sandwich would have been more than enough.  The shoestring garlic fries on the side had a great flavor although very greasy.  The hot one pizza is good with all of the spicy toppings they include - spicy giardiniera, jalapenos, spicy pepperoni and spicy oil.  Just make sure you have some water nearby.    We wouldn't hesitate stopping back in again.  Great location in NY NY with a great menu!",

If I remember correctly, I got pork (pork belly? Just shredded/carnitas? I don't remember.), lobster and shrimp, and carne asada tacos. I will say that Tom's Urban is definitely on the pricey side, but to get good food in Vegas, you tend to have to spend a lot of money, as made evident here -- the three tacos were about $20 on their own.  Our table also split a side of fries, but I forget the seasoning that was on them. Rosemary garlic or something? I'm not quite sure, but they were very good, especially with the ketchup they had -- I think it was called Moroccan ketchup, or something like that. All three tacos were fantastic, and it's hard to pick a favorite, but I'd probably vote for the seafood ones. My reason for four stars though (other than the price) is that two of the three tacos had to be eaten with a fork because they fell right through the tortillas when they were picked up. My suggestion would be to simply double up the tortillas to prevent (or lessen the chance of) that happening.  The service left a bit to be desired as it was rather slow despite it being I believe 11:30 on a Thursday, but the food was tasty enough to have me give Tom's four stars. I'd likely revisit the next time I'm in Vegas.",

Our server Maggie was fantastic.  She was very attentive and made recommendations that made our dining experience better.   I ordered the pickle brined fried chicken.  The chicken was boneless so it was more like a chick strips.  Made of of breast and thigh meat.  The chicken had a great crunch to it where it wasn't too hard.  The meat was juicy and tender and you can definitely taste the pickle brine.  The chicken tasted was seasoned with a Lawry's like seasoning and tasted good by itself, but with the Green Chile Ranch sauce that came with it, gave it a different dimension to the dish.  Even their ketchup was good.  It tasted home made and not store bought.  They have other different sauces that you can ask your server for.     I also checked in with Yelp and received a free crispy Brussels sprouts appetizer.  It was very good also.  They are usually open until 2pm so it's a great late night eatery if you are staying close by.",

If you're looking for a spot with decent food in large portions, this is your spot. They do everything well-- but nothing is finger-lickin good where you dream about one bite of that speciality entree for months to come.   We came here for brunch and I ordered the Beach Bum omelette, which was pretty tasty... wish I it was topped with more than 3 slices of avocado, though. It also came with sides of toast and hash browns. This dish could definitely serve 2! Hash browns were a bit mediocre (lukewarm and unseasoned) but not enough to get me riled up. Overall, a good place with quick service. Only complaint I have is that for such a large place, the bathrooms are single occupancy for each gender, so lines can get long!

I asked for a manager and when he came out, he was shaking profusely and then said okay hold on... no I'm sorry about your experience, nothing and he went back and took $40 offf!!! Wtf!

    "text": "I met up with some friends who were visiting from Georgia. We stopped in for lunch around 1:15. Our server Andrea seated is immediately in a comfortable booth, and got our drink orders. She brought our drinks immediately and got our food orders, making some recommendations. My friend T ordered a cuban and a kale side salad, and his wife E had the all American burger with regular fries. I got the Urban Chopped salad. Our food came out quickly, and our server was extremely attentive and friendly - I can't recall the last time I had such an excellent customer service experience dining on the strip.   My friends realized they had actually been there twice already during their visit but had eaten outside on the patio. They mentioned this to the server, and the manager Renzo even stopped over to thank them for their return visits - as he pointed out, there are so many choices in the area, it's a pretty big testament to food and service for someone on vacation to come back 3 times in a week!!  My salad was excellent! I live in the NW part of town and would venture back just for the salad! Such a great mix of flavors and textures. My friends really enjoyed their meals also! Since the lunch rush had cleared out, they paid and lingered to visit, and Andrea went above and beyond to still check on us, and offer us fresh water. It was an excellent meal, excellent service, and I will definitely be back....soon!",

The hostess didn't seem happy to see our group as she squeezed 2 tables and arranged a few chairs to accommodate us.  As a group we had the urban breakfast platter, killer chilaquiles, colorado hot brown & the urban slopper.  We all like to share so everyone can try a few different items.  It was all very good but the hot brown got the majority vote.  One in the group picked a shake called the Kraken, unbelievable!! That shake was so good we all ended up with one & wondered how we could get a kraken IV drip to wheel around with us on the strip.  After the initial seating experience, it was awesome.  Great table service, atmosphere, food & drink.",

Apparently, kitchen messed up our order and so they gave us extra tacos( which we didn't even finish as we didn't want to eat much). Our drinks took forever and the waiter was clearly having troubles with other customers. We constantly saw that people were coming up to him and com playing about something. In the end they messed up with our check and overcharged us. The waiter said that he couldn't find his manager so he decided to give us cash instead . He was really rude.

While we did not have a rude Hostess this time, she still seemed a little under trained. Our experience left us with almost the same opinion, the food is just too average for the price. We ordered fried pickles for an appetizer the big ass egg roll and a sloppy burger for an entree. Problem 1) they didn't bring the fried pickles until they brought the food at the same time.. what's the point of me ordering an appetizer to have it brought with my entree. Problem 2) the food was really average, the fry on the pickle was almost non-existent what was there was soggy the egg roll was overcooked and the sloppy Burger was a big plate that looks like throw up with a burger in the middle. Problem 3) is a bit of a good and bad, the location is nice to sit out on the patio and people watch but if you're sitting along the edge it's also close enough to be accosted by a homeless person asking for food - which we were. The positive was sitting outside during nice weather, drinking beer, and watching an MMA fight...I could probably do that anywhere else and not pay $8.50 a beer. So while I appreciate the management efforts I wouldn't come back here.",

The food was great but the service is the reason I will be coming back. Our server Dom was fantastic, he was friendly but not fake, well versed on the menu and made great suggestions. He checked on us multiple times and actually seemed to care if we liked our food. I have had a ton of bad service in restaurants that were supposed to be \"nice\", so I would easily recommend this place!",

Finally got my champagne.  Ordered food, when it was finally delivered, it wasn't as I'd ordered (I didn't make a bunch of high maintenance substitutions, just chose options from their menu).  The plate looked so completely unappetizing that I did not want the meal corrected, I just said forget it.  I couldn't have eaten what they delivered anyway, there wasn't any flatware on the table other than a knife and oversized soup spoon.  Ugh!

Our server was pretty terrible. Anytime we needed anything we would have to flag her down. She would come out to bring food to one table & not check on any of her other tables. We started with a few small items, then we ordered a pizza. We wanted black olives on it, but we were told that they do not have them, no worries. When the pizza was brought out by someone other than our server, we asked him for Parmesan & red pepper, he seemed a little bothered by that & replied \"give me a minute\". Well after 10 minutes I just ate the pizza without it. When I saw him walk by later I said \"you never brought us our Parmesan & red pepper flakes\".  His reply was \"oh I told you're server to bring them to you\" & he turned around. No apology, no accepting any sort of responsibility, nothing. I've never had a server respond to me in that manner. I will never be back & would definitely not recommend anyone to go here. Oh also, one of the other problems is there is only ONE men's & ONE women's single stall bathroom for the whole restaurant!!! Ridiculous, I don't even see how that is legal!",

However, people with the same amount of guests (3) in their party that got there after us were seated before us and we began to get irritated.   When we were seated, we waited over 20 minutes for a waitress to even greet us, let alone take our drink orders. It took us about two hours to get our food and eat, which was a little excessive. The waitress never checked in on us after taking our orders and bringing us our checks, and one of the people in my party didn't get everything she wanted on her burger.   The food was great, and the prices were relatively acceptable for the portion sizes, but the service makes me never want to go back. It wasn't worth the wait.",

Lobster & Shrimp Mac n Cheese: One would think that the dish is rich and creamy with delicious seafood. The Mac n cheese was decent and flavorful, but the lobster tasted very dry and overcooked along with the shrimp. I would skip this one (3/5)  2. NYNY Strip: The steak came out burnt and dry. The picture would say otherwise, but it didn't taste so great in the mouth. It came with sweet potato fries, which were decent, along with Moroccan ketchup. The ketchup was okay. For a pricey meal, it just wasn't worth it (3/5)  Service was decent, but we could tell that they kind of wanted us out of the place - that sucks, one shouldn't feel rushed to finish eating; we are the customers! But anyways, for the price that you pay for the meal, it just doesn't match up to par with the quality you expect from the food.",

Although the menu is alluring with the offering, I found each item ordered lacking.  Item one was the Mexican grilled street corn. This had a peculiarly foul taste as the corn was frozen. The lobster sandwich was a rip off. Barely any lobster but tons and tons of lettuce bacon and my god the freakin bread was like a full loaf. My wife had the steak tacos which too were average.   Worst of this experience was the service. Horrible. Brought wrong beer twice and barely could find her. We waited and waited and waited.  Need an overhaul here of food quality and service.",

The hostess took my information to see about a table and then came back 20 minutes later and asked me \"did you put your name down already?\".  Apparently she forgot about our group... Our waitress was running around the place like a chicken with her head cut off so I am not sure if she was overworked or if waiting tables is not her thing.  It took at least 20 minutes to get 1 beer and 1 moscow mule and another 30 to get our food.  The dishes came out in different orders so the birthday boy started his burger while the rest of us were already licking our plates.  We were going to order dessert (as we were celebrating a birthday) but I was afraid that I might have to sit there for another hour.

The music is obnoxiously loud and when we politely asked for it to be turned down we were told that it was restaurant policy not to change the volume on the music, that people ask all the time, but \"management\" doesn't allow it.  So if people ask for the music to be turned down all the time, that truly should tell management that it is too loud!  We were there to eat and socialize, not to have pounding and blaring music so loud we had to shout our order to the server, etc.  I wanted our party of 10 to walk out at that point, but since we made a reservation and the restaurant wasn't too busy due to it being Christmas Eve, we wanted to keep things pleasant.  But we certainly will not return.  Very disappointed!",

I have to continuously call the waiter over - first to fill an empty water glass and then to ask for ketchup after he delivered a sandwich with French fries.         Our waiter (Tim) was about as bad as a waiter could be.  Inattentive, grab-assing with the other wait staff while we were trying to flag him down, and reaching across the table in front of me to reach my wife's glass (instead of walking around to her side of the table.  Really bad in so many levels.       The food was extremely mediocre - pulled pork sandwich was skimpy - roll was soggy, and the sauce was weak.  Sweet potato fries were over salted.  The Margherita pizza consisted of undercooked dough, what tasted like Ragu pizza sauce, and a melted string cheese stick.  Top this off with our waiter, Tim, serving it with his thumb firmly planted in a slice, mmmm delicious.  Not.      The music was loud and competed with different music coming from outdoor speakers beyond the patio and a street electric guitarist.  The drinks were expensive but I am giving the place 1 star because of its perfect patio location - great for people watching.  So, other than the food, the wait staff, and the pricey drinks - this place rocks.",

I should have just paid a couple more dollars for the breakfast plate instead. Would have been more worth it.  The pizza was about 11 inches cut up in 4 peices. It was soft and chewy and tasted very generic. I make better pizza in the oven buying it from the store.   If I ever came back, I know not to at least get the pizza.  My guy had burger and garlic fries.  I didn't care for the fries but they were VERY greasy! So just a heads up for that one.",

Managers,even the GM AND the corporate center refuse to respond to him and help identify where is paycheck is or even reissue a new one. Even when they've admitted to have seen it.

I asked the gal 3x for water and kept having to remind her for napkins. Not to mention the portions are small and the chicken was on the dry side :(   UGH!!! Between the servers' 'whatever-like' service, the over priced food, and the poor management, from an ex-employees experience, Im just soo done with this place!

We tried to call ahead for a table but they weren't taking any reservations.  Think it was because of St Patricks Day and March Madness.  No biggie though.  We grabbed shots and beers at the bar while we waited for a table since there was 6 of us.  Great beer selection and cool patio which was packed.  So, not really sure if it's a sports bar but there's lots of TVs and the host set us up with a great spot where we could see multiple games all at once which was cool.  Big food menu with lots to choose from.  Pretty awesome they serve breakfast all day.  I got the steak & eggs and lemon poppyseed blueberry pancakes.   Both were on point and the portions were huge.  Way too much food!  Other guys got burgers, pork belly tacos, buffalo wings, steak and fries .  Gotta try the sin city burger next time.  It had a fried egg, fried onions, cheddar cheese and bacon.  Looked delicious and my buddy said he loved it.    For how busy they were, service was good too.  Our server Zooey was super cool.  2 of the steak dishes were over cooked so we had to send back.  She was very accommodating.  Of course they were too rare the 2nd time.  We're a fairly high maintenance crew though.  And I was good because my steak was cooked perfect.  Lol.  A manager did come by to apologize since they weren't to our liking even on the 2nd try.  He ended up bringing us a couple pop tarts (yeah, they have pop tarts!), a Fireball milkshake, a caramel Kraken milkshake and he took the steaks off our bill.  Pretty cool.  I've never had a milkshake with liquor in it.  Yummy stuff   Aside from the steak incident, everything was really good.  Interesting food with lots to choose from.  Cool vibe.  Good service.  Will definitely be back again soon",

Other notable dishes were the lobster mac n cheese, the canitas sandwich, and the big ass eggroll. Our waitress was super friendly and made sure we had a good time.

Pros:  They sat us in our own quiet corner,  Cons: Service was poor, our waitress was not good about checking on us.  I had the steamed bun sliders - it was not what I had expected.. (its a combo of a steamed bun and a slider) ..  My boyfriend had the black bean burger. It was huge, but had poor texture (was falling apart and dry).  We ordered sweet potato fries but got regular fries. Once we got the waitress's attention she did bring us the right ones. They were both good.  The adult shake was quite good, and it would be the only thing I would go back for.  Not our best meal in vegas.  Decor was fun.. I wonder if we had sat in the bar, while loud, it seemed to have better service.  They had a happy hour that would start in an hour, perhaps we caught them at the lull of the night before the late night crowd came in.",

So far they are still working out the kinks as with any new restaurant opening, but it should prove to be a go-to spot. This is their third location in 2 years so clearly they are doing something right. The menu is a mixed bag of twists on different ethnic dishes like burritos and potstickers with some good American standards with Tom's Urban flair as the base. I've only seen the day menu so far, but supposedly their breakfast plates are to die for. I'll be back.",

    "text": "Loved the food! The restaurant just opened yesterday (12/29/14) but I could already tell that this is the spot to be! My boyfriend and I got tired of gambling and wanted to have a late night snack (if you call it a snack) but didn't feel like fast food. We are done walking and after a few beers/drinks at the slot machines there's no way we are driving anywhere. I know it's Vegas baby but still after all day walking from one casino to the next I'm pooped! We stumbled upon this spot coz it seems like they're still serving food and yup we were in luck coz they were! We were so happy we didn't even care to look at the menu before going in (we had no idea what kind of food they served) I thought for a second that it was a mexican restaurant coz of the hot sauce on the tables but the siracha threw me off though! Could it be Chinese? Ahhhh so the friendly hostess sat us and gave us the menu. They have burgers, tacos, sandwiches, breakfast items from pancakes to omelette and shakes as well (with alcohol may I add). So it's not Chinese after all hahaha. I ordered the filet mignon steak with eggs and toast. My boyfriend ordered the portobello mushroom swiss burger and garlic fries. And I did try to order a chocolate shake but their shake machine has not arrived yet (that's how new this place is) no biggie I can live without the shake. The food was great! My steak was cooked medium rare as I requested and melted in my mouth. My boyfriends burger was cooked medium and he ate it in less than 10 minutes. He said its one of the best burgers he had. He's a burger lover so I'll take his word for it. Over all the foods great, the service was great and we will definitely come back to eat here again when we come back to Sin City!",

The reason for the 2 star review is that within 10 minutes from leaving, everyone who ordered the omelettes instantly came down with food poisoning. We were all talking during lunch that we wanted to return for brunch tomorrow, but now we're a little apprehensive about the sanitation/quality control in the kitchen...

Tom's Urban is a brand new, fresh, unique, delicious twist to a classic American cuisine for the whole family. The restaurant is gorgeous. Everything is modern- from the dozen flat screen televisions to the beautifully decorated walls. The staff was incredibly welcoming. We were warmly greeted at the entrance and shown to a comfortable circular booth. Our waiter, Alex was fantastic. He's the type of waiter we all enjoy- down to earth and able to answer any type of question. I was extremely impressed by the menu. All items had a unique twist, like a \"Big Ass Eggroll\" and a \"Korean BBQ Burger\". We made up our minds and ordered. The appetizer, Buffalo Wings, came. They were spectacular. A spicy chili sauce coated the six meaty wings. They were juicy inside and had a buttery finish. Definitely a wing to write home about. For the main course I enjoyed a burger and fries which were perfectly prepared. Tom's offers a half pound burger cooked to your liking. The fries were shoestring cut with a garlic finish. The food was perfect and I can't wait to come back to Tom's on my next visit to Vegas.",

No, this fondue was delectable and it left me wanting more. The next time I went there I got the breakfast burrito...and it is more than enough for 2 people! Holy cow! It was also very delicious.

    "text": "I'm originally from Connecticut, so we wanted to visit and have lunch inside the New York New York Casino to feel \"at home.\"  We were starving after walking around for a couple of hours and kept getting disappointed that the restaurants we wanted to eat at were only open for dinner. Tom's was open, and lively - it was Sunday, so all the football games were on. We had to wait 15 minutes for a table of 3 which wasn't bad, considering how busy every place in Vegas always is.  Once we were sat we noticed a breakfast/brunch buffet. We didn't ask but assumed that is an option for earlier in the day?  I know they are one of the most basic bar foods, but I have never had sliders, so I decided to try them here. The Buffalo Chicken Sliders come with chopped celery, blue cheese dressing (I am a ranch substituter) and topped with a cherry tomato. They were AWESOME! Buffalo sauce is one of my favorites and they nailed the taste. I ordered garlic fries as my side - they were VERY garlicky. My friend and I loved them, but her fiance said the taste was overpowering, so I guess they're for garlic lovers! I tried some of my friend's turkey club. It was piled HIGH and tasted great - very fresh.  If you're looking for something simple, comfortable and filling, this is a great place.",

But, after walking around the casino I work in, I stumbled upon Tom's Urban and the rest is history... Let's just say, their happy hour is f***in killer!! With their extensive craft beers on tap and beautiful restaurant setting and smack dab on the strip, this place is hard to not come to after work. Half off the entire bar pretty much, like a 22oz is only $4 and like a 40oz of any beer your choice is $10 like wtf!?! Why did it take me almost 4 months of me living here to find them!?  Anyways, staff is hella cool and hospitable they remind me a bit of home (San Diego) and that's one of the many reasons I keep coming back and bringing new faces to their restaurant. The food is great here too and this place is well kept and modern like. Only downfall is their bathroom is one-at-a-time stalls so you may need to use the casino floor restrooms but their not that far. Overall, a MUST PLACE TO VISIT!!! If you hate having a good time, smiling or even good selections of craft beer on tap this place is not for you. Just saying (sorry not sorry).",

Their happy hour has some great bites, including the tots, at discounted prices. The steak nachos on the regular menu was disappointing. Some of their chips were WAY over-salted. Their drink prices are pretty good for a place that overlooks the strip and you can get discounted drinks on happy hour too at 1/2 off. Great deal! I recommend their urban marg. The service has been great each visit. The bbq pizza was good, but it said it came with jalapenos, but ours did not have any. Otherwise, we'll probably make a visit every time we stay at NYNY.",

    "text": "How does this place stay in business. I guess I should have known how the food was going to taste by how empty the restaurant was. This wasn't our first choice of restaurant to eat at but the hotel gave us a comp so we picked here. Big mistake!  So remember, our food was comped so it was free. Plus this wasn't our first choice. So our expectations were not high at all. Just wanted a decent meal. This restaurant failed in most areas.  First of all, a soda costs $4.00! Ridiculous.  Then we order deep fried pickles. It was so salty we had to ask them to replace it with fried Brussels sprouts. After eating about half of the sprouts, the bottom half of the dish had sprouts that were soaking in oil, so we didn't eat the rest. They don't even care about the health of their customer to drain the oil before serving. They would rather have us to consume extra frying oil to clog our arteries.  We also got the loaded tater tots. This was the only menu item that was decent. The tots were crispy and had cheese sauce and bacon bits.  I love tater tots so they would have to be terrible for me to not like tater tots.   We ordered their Tom's Loaded Pizza for $16.49. Their pizza is a joke. The pizza tastes like a bad frozen supermarket pizza. Crust looks like it's pre-made and frozen, and it's SPONGY. Not crispy at all. Look at the posted pics. It tasted really bad. I didn't even finish the first piece and the rest of the pizza you see in the picture was dumped in the trash. What a waste. The only positive thing is the pizza is kind of small (only one size) so at least I didn't have to throw away a huge pizza.   The fries came out cold. The sweet potato fries were very soggy, didn't finish it. The garlic fries were cold but still tasted crispy so we just ate it.  This place doesn't have have unique or creative menu items, but at least make whatever you do serve taste halfway decent.  I wouldn't go back. Definitely wouldn't pay my hard earned money here. But it's pretty bad if I won't even come back here if the food was free. Go somewhere else. Plenty of other choices nearby. Believe me you'll thank me.",

My friend got the jalapeno popper burger, which was more of the same: good, but nothing special.  There were a few flies that kept annoying us during our meal, and we weren't that close to the door, not sure how that could be fixed, but just something to note.

I feel like whoever made the cornbread pancake forgot to add something. It tasted like corn meal and nothing else. It wasn't savory, sweet, salty, nothing. Even with the syrup...blah. I wouldn't order that again, but Tom's Urban was a nice spot. Very spacious inside, but also with outdoor seating prime for people-watching outside New York casino.

Our dining in Vegas this week was hit or miss and this place just exceeded my expectation on all fronts.  We stayed in the quieter bar area and listened to music while chatting with the bartender who was a TOTAL sweetheart and ensured we were well taken care of the entire stay. I wish I got her name because she is truly an asset to Tom's Urban! She recommended the burger, which I had - it was named the \"BBQ burger\" but I got it with the sauce on the side.  Let me tell you-the burger was SPOT ON. Thick, juicy, and done to medium rare perfection. The grilled jalapenos offset the crispy onions and sweet BBQ sauce perfectly. It really was a great recommendation. Also, I got garlic fries on the side. Sometimes when you get garlic fries they are so sticky with garlic that you have to practically visit the dentist to scrape the flavor out of your mouth. Not these! Crispy outside, tender inside, just enough garlic and nice and salty.   My fiance ordered the Nashville hot wings, which of course I confiscated one of - let me tell you-this may be THE perfect wing. Crispy fried coating with some heat to it, just after you bite, though, you get this SWEETNESS underneath that comes through. I seriously would come back to Vegas just for that wing. His other wings were the Honey BBQ - and even though they had a bit too much sauce on them, miraculously they were crispy underneath - and also delicious. Just not the level of deliciousness that the Nashville Hot Wings brought forth.  The drink I ordered was a blueberry mule and it was nice and stiff ans till cold and refreshing, with a pop of ginger.  Great all around experience! we will be back for sure.",

Place was far from packed so... if the brussel sprouts and fried pickles were not as good as they were this place probably would have gotten 1 star",

Kudos to Toms Urban for not cutting corners on the food preparation & taste!!!",

We wanted to sit outside on the strip so we waited for about 10 minutes which wasn't had. The atmosphere is very cool and party-like. They have loud music playing and the seating is very close together like a party. They have a nice sized brunch menu and bottomless mimosas. This is what made me come here. I did the create your own omelette and it was AMAZING and big! The mimosas were very strong. I don't know what champagne they use but...usually I do not get drunk off mimosas. All it took was three from here and I had to catch my balance a little to stand. AWESOME! Lol   The service was a little on the bad side. Our server didn't check on us much and she messed up my order. I order sausage on my omelette and she put in bacon so I had to wait for mine to be remade. No apology or anything. We also had to chase her down for our bill. But I will definitely be returning! I want to try their dinner!",

I was stuck with either having the sun in my face or sitting in the chilly shade, but I also could've just worn warmer clothing.  The people watching outside New York New York was a nice way to pass the time.  I ordered the urban breakfast platter.  My sunny side up eggs were cooked well, though the bacon was quite oily and chewy.  The sourdough toast was a little light on the butter but had a great chew.  The standouts were the amazing asadero hash browns and the little cup of preserves for the toast.  I would definitely go back for the cheesy goodness of those potatoes, and the sweetness of the preserves was a perfect compliment to the salty toast, especially after it had been dipped in egg yolk.  It's probably partially because I was seated on the patio when it was very windy and chilly in the shade, but my only real complaint is that the temperature of my food was off.  The cheese was solidified on the hash browns, the toast has hardened into sharp rock-hard shards, and the bacon was not crispy.  Perhaps my food was waiting at the pass longer than it should have been?  Service was otherwise great, my water stayed filled, and my request for a new ketchup bottle was taken care of promptly.  I feel their prices are very reasonable considering their location, especially when compared to the prices many of the casino's cafes are charging.",

It may have been just a dash of garlic oil  Brussel sprouts - amazing! Best deep fried Brussel sprouts I've ever had!  Flavorful sauce, perfectly crisp but not burnt sprouts,  and good portion size  Honey bbq chicken sliders -pretty tasty although the bread could have been toasted more,  and was just a little stale/cold for my taste.   Although the sliders were breast meat,  it was not dry, and you can't go wrong with honey bbq  Honey bbq chicken wings -we were given this on the house due to a misunderstanding,  pretty standard for wings.  Overall, this is a solid place if you're people watching on a cooler evening on the strip",

The menu is quite extensive and an interesting twist on various street foods.  The location is good with entrances from the strip and from inside the hotel. The server was friendly and engaging.   The bad - the prices!  Especially on the cocktails.  $22.50 each. And the Long Island Iced Tea was horrible. Truly awful, mainly lemonade not sour mix.  The food was just okay.  I expected more flavor, more spice; it was all a bit bland.   The crazy annoying - it was very warm, so we asked about the A/C and the manager came over and said it was under the control of the hotel and there was nothing he could do. Well, calling engineering is something. Then while serving the entrees, same manager fumbled two entrees and they crashed to the floor.   The total failure - the staff said the could not split the check more than the two tables we were sitting at, not by couples.  Then when the checks were presented everything was mixed up. Drinks from Table A on Table B, appetizers from B on A.  And it took them 40 minutes to correct it. Forty minutes!  Final thought - it's an interesting concept that could be executed better. The staff's attitude is one of indifference since they cater to tourists and locals will avoid.",

    "text": "I stopped in for the first time, for lunch today and woah! The burger craving that I DIDN'T even know that I had... was cured.   It didn't start with the burger though... first we had an order of the chicken pot stickers as a starter. Pretty dang good. The dipping sauce served with it was great - not too sweet, not to spicy...it was kind of syrup-y but not in a bad way! The chicken in the potsticker had a nice flavor to it that thr sauce really compliments.  The burger... I had not had a burger with a fried egg as a topping, not before, not ever. After hearing my boss rave about the Korean burger, I instantly found myself searching for a burger, in general. The server (very polite and attentive) recommended the Sin City burger so I went with it. It looked good when it was brought to my table and I noticed that it was something that I wanted to finish, but might not make it (large burger) ha! I did get my burger sans bacon and onions, and I'm now regretting omitting the bacon. I had been worried about the bbq sauce conflicting with the egg... but I wanted to try it as it was (as much as I could do, diet wise) so I left it and holy bbq! It went so well! The bbq especially complimented the grill produced crunch that the burger had around the outside. I think I've found my new favorite specialty burger :)",

    "text": "This place seems good, but our personal experience was meh.   We were relieved to find a place that offered a menu with more variety than just late night, greasy fast food. We were hungry & wanted to enjoy our first meal in Vegas.  We ordered a shrimp salad, duck wings & burger to share.  The salad came out first. We started eating it and realized it was all just leaves. We waited around for our waitress for approx 10 min & ended up flagging down another restaurant employee before she returned. We complained that there we shrimps to be found in the salad... He apologized and went to pass on the message.   6-8 shrimps show separately on a mini plate about 5 min later. The salad was made up of leaves, dressing and basic shrimp. Definitely a disappointment & really nothing to write home about.   The duck wings were the highlight. They were delicious. Crunchy, sweet & tangy! They are on the pricey side @ $14 for 4 & I am not a huge fan of the mound of raw cabbage they laid on. The flavors were amazing. This owns a star rating in itself.   The portobello burger was meh. The cheese was melted into some rubbery plastic inedible texture.. The mushroom and buns were dried out.  The fries were good! We enjoyed those - the sweet potato and garlic fries each came with their own \"Caribbean\" and \"Mediterranean\" ketchup dips, which were fantastic.   I think it really comes down to what you order.. I wouldn't return unless it were for their duck wings and fries.",

Massive restaurant with multiple seating areas (yet spotty service) and a gigantic menu that spans several cuisines- none of them particularly strong. This may be a decent-enough option for all-hours dining on the Strip, but as a local, it's not a place I'll seek out to revisit.  The killer shrimp and grits dish I experienced at a Yelp event fell flat when I came back and received a bland, boring version with cold, flavorless shrimp. The duck wings are a delight, but the regular wings were dry and unappetizing. The prime rib philly was the only version of prime rib I've ever seen my guy refuse to take more than a few bites of: it was overly salty, tough, and generally not appealing. The drinks were okay, they just took our entire meal to get.  All in all, I'm not impressed. Pare down the menu, retrain your servers, and try again. If I'm in the area in need of a quick, tasty bite, I'll be heading to Shake Shack instead... and it's not because I'm a big burger fan.",

Ordered the vegetarian eggs benedict, they were perfect. Opted for the side of asado hash browns, which ended up to be about half cup of cooked hash browns with a melted white cheese on top... good but slightly out of the ordinary.   Also shared the fig and three cheese panini, went for the piggy figgy (with bacon) which ended up meaning bacon in the panini and on the side... not sure if that's how it comes or if our waiter was off. Delish. Recommend sharing as it came with 3 halves and a side..  pick sweet potatoe fries!!  Also they have \"toms sized\" drinks. We didn't see the size differences listed on the menu so we asked our waiter what the difference was. He just said \"the size\"... Yea dude we get that part, but like the differences in ounces?? Ohhhhh, 22 vs. 16 oz. So think of Tom's size as a Venti, or about a Venti sized glass of alcoholic goodness.   They also have urban pop tarts. We missed out since they sold out, the waiter told us they were making more. But didn't give us the option to order when they were ready. Too bad!",

There was another large bar on the opposite side too. The  sandwiches come with a choice of either garlic or sweet potato fries. I ordered the Cuban (without onions) with sweet potato fries and my husband ordered the prime rib philly with sweet potato fries. Both of our fries were only Luke warm. Hubby liked his sandwich but didn't care for the juice to dip it in. It was thick like a gravy. I did not care for mine at all. It barely had any pork on it and a excessive amount of mustard that overpowered everything. It also had onions on it that I picked off & didn't say anything. The bartender noticed all the onions on my plate and he offered me a cocktail because they screwed up. I thought that was pretty nice of him. Usually people just pick up your plate and say nothing. We'd go back again for drinks but probably skip the food.",

This was slightly better but there is nothing that inspires me to return.  We ordered lunch here on Saturday 5/14 and sat right at the edge where the inside and outside meet.  The weather was great and that was probably the best part of the lunch.  Our server was nice but as has been the case with Tom's Urban twice now, the staff doesn't do a good job of keeping on their customers.  Our waters went unfilled several times and in general, while there are a lot of people running food, it seems way too scattered.  It must just be the chain in general.  We started with the Double Dip Hummus with was good but they short you on the pita bread so you end up with half of your dip left without anything to dip with.  So we ordered more pita bread which came out burnt to a crisp so that was that.    My wife ordered the Urban Street Tacos.  She to two of the shrimp and lobster and one of the mahi mahi.  The mahi mahi was terrible.  She said it was basically unedible.  The other two were good however.    I ordered the Boulder Club and specifically asked for it to come without avocado and of course it arrives with a nice heaping pile of avocado on it.  It was a bit dry otherwise and the bread was over-toasted which seems to be a theme here.    Since we are 0-2 on this restaurant and that's in two different states, I doubt we will try it again.",

Home run recommendations: High Roller (refreshing on a scorching day), duck wings (scrumptious) upside down pineapple cake (heavenly and came out hot and fresh). The food came out quick too. BBQ ribs were soft and tasty (but not hot), didn't care for the hash browns, stick to the sweet potato fries, milk shakes are so-so.   Sit on the patio and its a great people watching. Many people take pictures in front of the resteraunt since it's near the fake NYC bridge. Don't worry  the water misters will keep u cool.",

The mini Mac and Cheese with carnitas and green chiles was amazing, the avo bacon burger was perfectly cooked and I think these were possibly the best garlic fries I've ever had - full of flavor but not punching you in the face with garlic. I regret not saving room for their pineapple upside down cake with mango sauce, thank god there is one in LA so I can continue fattening up in 2015.",

So imagine my excitement when I was planning a Vegas trip and saw they had recently opened a location in Vegas! My mom and I visited the night we arrived and the location is perfect. Right on the strip, great people watching, lots of indoor and outdoor seating. We opted to sit on the patio and people watch.   We started with the Mini Mac & Cheese Pot (one of my favorites from Denver). It's gooey delicious mac and cheese with pork green chili carnitas and pico de gallo. Not as good as I remembered, but still pretty awesome! For dinner, we ordered the Avocado Shrimp and Urban Chopped salads. They were very generous portions and packed with flavor. I was starving, but couldn't even finish my salad as it was so big.   They have so many other items on their menu that I would like to try, so I will be back when visiting Denver or Las Vegas!",

We didn't end up just getting the beer, our check was $80+. Food was good, don't get the buffalo wings. They were overpriced by double in my opinion. Mini mac n cheese pot was delicious.

The portions are good sizes while the quality of food is good. The garlic fries are a must try. Our waitress was awesome and attentive, I believe her name was janiffer she had an awesome accent as well. I will eat here again and if your in town give it a try.

Decided to eat here again on our next trip in May and brought along another couple who had never been here before.  Made reservations online but were able to get in 45 minutes early.  We were nervous wondering if we would get the same high quality service and food we had the first time. We were not disappointed!  Server and Maggie was attentive, friendly and helpful with menu questions. The potstickers were as good as I remembered-soft, tasty little pockets of goodness with a yummy dipping sauce. I was so excited to eat them I forgot to take a picture so my only photo was of an empty plate. Our friends tried the nachos which they loved and we also tried the brussel sprouts, which were the best I've ever had in a restaurant.  Charred but not bitter, and the sauce was full of flavor but not too spicy or sweet.  We sat on the patio and enjoyed the shade and the stripside sights and sounds. We took advantage of the 4:00 happy hour prices so even the overall bill was better than expected. Tom's Urban is definitely on our \"go-to\" list when in Las Vegas.",

Both were great!! ...but I was still hungry.  Between the two small plates and two ipa drafts I rang up a $45 tab.  Draft beer options were impressive (30+ on tap). Docked a star for pricey-ness.

Service was excellent until they got slammed before the hockey game...then it took a little while to get our check.  We came back the next morning for breakfast...once again the food was delicious and service excellent...highly recomend the lemon, poppy seed, blueberry pancakes...unbelievably good.",

He then came back with our drinks and then asked what we wanted to order. Again our food came out pretty quickly but I also asked for a side of ranch for my fries. I waited another 10 minutes for the side of ranch and had to ask 3 times. I would understand if the restaurant was packed and super busy but it wasn't. He never asked if we enjoyed the food or how we were doing. Not even a smile. If you want to earn a good tip you should probably act like you don't hate your job. Not a pleasant dining experience",

The frites were delicious and the chimichurri steak was okay.  Friend had the Philly cheesesteak dip and it looked bad.  Even the dipping sauce looked like thick gravy.

BLT Lobster roll was fishy and the bun seemed like stale left overnight bun, too thick for the lack of lobster filling 3. All American sliders were as unappetizing as it looks... worst slider buns, Hawaiian buns would have been better 4. Kids Cheese pizza - son ate it all so I guess it's decent or that he's super hungry 5. Lemon poppyseed & blueberry pancakes we the best, quite fluffy and delicious  6.

They made a new Mule without protest and it was perfect. I ordered the breakfast blt and my other two friends ordered benedicts. We were all thoroughly satisfied with our selections.

The beef tacos were cold, uneventful, no taste. We swapped for the mac n cheese, which after a LONG wait came out and was hot and covered with pulled pork. The pork chili was tasty, but really thin like a soup not my expectations for chili. If you want a tasty soup it's a good choice. It was accompanied with a folded tortilla that was so hard and dried out to be inedible. Ambience is different. Roomy. Loud. Too many other good places to eat at.",

We were handed menus and it took awhile for our server to take our order.   We ordered a variety of dishes: salted caramel French toast, an omelette, filet mignon with eggs, two of the breakfasts, and two burgers. We ordered the french toast as an \"appetizer\"  The salted caramel french toast was average, it was warm and the caramel added just enough sweetness that I didn't need to add maple syrup.   Almost everything else was horrible. First off, it took over 30 minutes for our food to come out. If the restaurant was busy, I'd understand, but it wasn't busy at all. And when our food did come out, it was grim. We asked for eggs to be scrambled soft and they came out like hard jello. The omelette was completely cold. The hash browns that come with the meal were disgusting. I understand that they melt cheese on top of it, but it was barely edible. The filet was supposed to be medium rare, but it came out black and blue. The only average things were the burgers and that's because they were hot.  We asked for the food to be sent back. Someone came out and talked to us, but made it seem like it was our fault that the food was like that. He told us that the omelette was going to seem cold because of the avocado on top. Yes, the avocado was cold, but I didn't realize eggs and bacon were supposed to get cold because of that too. He eventually took off the breakfasts that were sent back.   Definitely wouldn't recommend this place. There's so many better places on the Strip!",

Ordered and waited for about 20 to 30 min before getting our food which I would say is good timing based off how busy they were. Waitress was really good at filling up our drinks before they went empty. Overall if you want to watch a game and get a bite to eat I would suggest this as one of the places to go.",

    "text": "This resturant is one of a kind. I'm still shocked about my experience here, and hopefully my input might possibly save you from leaving completely disappointed.   The decor and the concept of the restaurant is beautiful and fabulous. HDTVs everywhere, it's simple which would lead you to believe that they serve great food here. The service here is fast and friendly. To be honest with you, my server accidentally made a mistake on my order and I wasn't even mad at that. Everyone makes mistakes. The server was friendly, and provided excellence service. Even the manager was also around asking for feedback and checking on customers. When you have those components at a eatery it usually leads to great things.   However, I would avoid this place because the food is M E D I O C R E! What puts the cherry open top is the prices. I ordered a Carnitas Cubano, the presentation looked like a normal grilled cheese sandwich but the only thing I tasted in the sandwich was mustard. And they charged 15 dollars for a sandwich that tasted like mustard? It came with a kale salad which didn't have anything appealing to it. It also didn't have any dressing. The menu is overpriced and not worth the value. 18 dollars for nachos? The place just leads you on for a epic let down. Just to put this into perspective, Earl of Sandwich cost 7 dollars for a sandwich and its taste great. They're too many places on the strip that charge half of what Tom Urban charges for more appetizing food.   So honestly, I don't think good service nor the manager can change my mind about this place until the food actually is appetizing. I don't understand how this place is holding down a 4 star rating? This the only meal I've ever regret having in Vegas.",

We were a party of 11, where 7 of them got their food within a reasonable time. 5 minutes pass, 10 minutes....server comes and says I'm not sure what happened to the rest of your guys' food let me go check on it. Another 5 minutes, then another 10. Server goes to the other server who took our order to see what happened. We finally get our food over 20 minutes after the others received their food, all of them pretty much done eating. I ask for a manager. Manager looks confused and says \"which table are you talking about\" and I say who else, our table. She then says it only took 5 minutes. Our whole table laughed because she had to be joking. But nope, that was her story and she was sticking to it with a massive attitude. She walks away with nothing resolved. Some time later she sends a server to tell us we got 10 percent off the check. Manager was very rude. The food- lobster Mac and cheese was fishy and cold. Chicken club was not good, tots tasted like oil and the fries had the texture of 3 day old fries.  So many other choices in Vegas, best to skip out on this one unless you are into cold bland food.",

The pulled pork sliders were yummy, but the garlic fries that came out with them were matchstick style and cold. Asked to have them exchanged for the kale side salad which was just OK. We shared the fried pickles - don't forget to let your server know when you check in for your free fried pickles or Brussels sprouts! They were interesting, and pretty good. Beers were over $9, kind of high. Overall a fun experience with good food.",

Awesome breakfast and lunch options of all varieties and they have Bloody Mary's with bacon in them, so good! I went for brunch and got the Figgy Piggy sandwich which was so freaking good I wish they had this restaurant in my home state so I could get it again. It had 3 cheeses on it with a fig jam to top it off. This sandwich came with shoestring fries and the serving was so large I couldn't finish it and saved the rest for later.   I also loved the atmosphere! When we were there recently, they were playing classic 80s music videos on their tvs. Our server was also very friendly and efficient.  The menu also had really fun meal descriptions!!   Can't wait to return to LV and visit Tom's Urban!",

It turns out they only have drinks from one company ( once again choices are being taken away from us ) we asked for medium well done meat. They came completely pink, no dressing, no lettuce, no tomatoes, no pickles. It was about 21:00$. When we asked about that the server said I can bring you those as side order. Which we did ask for them. As soon as we ate the burgers, our stomachs started growling and immediately we had to run to the bathrooms. We had ordered two different type of hamburgers. My wife's was about 17:00 $ the jalapeno burger. None of us had breakfast nor lunch today and since we were hungry and had waited 30 minutes to be seated , we had finished more than 1/2 our burgers so, we paid for them and left.    I felt that for the first time I should write a review for a restaurant and let others know and not to waste their time and money for this place or if you still want to go, please lower your expectations way, way down so you won't be so disappointed.",

    "text": "An overall regrettable dining experience. The hostess was unapproachable or dare I say, \"bitchy.\" Also, we had no server once we were seated - a random server came up to us to let us know, explicitly, that he wasn't our server but he will take our drink orders. As we were ready to order, we also had to place our order with our not-so-server, but we kept having to flag him down to ask questions about the menu. I was irritated since we didn't receive a proper introduction, recommendation or detailed explanation of the menu.  Unfortunately, we were seated in a booth that shares the same corner as the staff's registers - what an awkward set-up. While we waited for our dinner we heard, loud and clear, server conversations; bickering and critiquing each-other. We also couldn't avoid hearing an earful of servers singing, obnoxiously. It's not a comfortable ambiance for us to relax in each others presence, or even enjoy private conversation.  The food was laughable. There was only one dish that we could honestly recommend and it was $13 ghost pepper chicken wings. That's it? The menu seems very confused and I'm sure the chef is just as confused.  Let's go through the items we tried:  Ghost pepper wings ghost chili BBQ and green ranch chili sauce $13 -Shockingly, this was the only item of the evening that we actually enjoyed. I loved the perfect balance of sweetness and the spicy heat offered in the ghost chili BBQ sauce. The ranch consistency was watery, but the flavor was unique and delicious. The wings were cooked properly and had a decent amount of moist meat. But seriously. Wings are wings, you aren't really missing anything here. Flavor rating: 4/5  Sticky belly steamed buns $9 - Total white-boy style (in a bad way) we weren't a fan of the dry, hard bao bun, tough, overcooked thick cut bacon & weird tangy salad dressing sauce. Also, the cabbage slaw looked wilted and brown. I've had my share of tasty baos in Vegas (try: Bachi Burger, Gordon Ramsey BurGR, Fat Choy) and this sits at the very bottom of the list. This dish needs major work. Blegh. Flavor rating: 2/5  Low country shrimp and grits $10 -  A serious disappointment. The \"crispy pork belly\" was a prank that was written on the menu description. It's actually tiny bits of chopped (hard) bacon. The fishy, tiny, frozen shrimp was offensively over-salted and lacking substantial cajun flavor. The grits were dry and bland and tasted like oatmeal, plus the cheddar cheese was sparse. All amateur mistakes. Flavor rating: 2/5  Sweet potato fries with Caribbean ketchup $4 - They arrived at our table room temperature and stale; we sent them back for a re-do. I was offended that we couldn't even get freshly fried sweet potatoes and that they offered us unwelcome fries from a heat lamp. The fries were standard, the ketchup was unique - but it's still nothing to write home about. You may want to go the extra mile and request some of the green chili ranch to pair with these fries - they work well together. Flavor rating: 2/5  After a disenchanting dinner, we were ready to leave our experience far behind us. This place is not for us and probably not for you either if you appreciate your taste buds.",

    "text": "After a fun-filled night of drinking and shenanigans, it has been my experience that people go for the cheap, heavy and greasy foods to \"revive\" and rally for the next round of debauchery. Call me crazy, but I want a light-ish quality dish to bring me back to life.  Even though I come from the Los Angeles area, I have not had the opportunity to snag a bite at this place before so I was excited to give ol' Tom's a go.   Pros: Upon arriving my guest and I were promptly greeted and seated. We requested to sit outside on the patio despite it being over 100 because of the awesome mist machines they have all over that made it feel like a refreshingly warm day. Not uncomfortable at all. I ordered the tree hugger eggs benedict with the side salad and a classic urban mule (waiter warned against frozen). The food was amazing and very well done. The eggs were poached to perfection and there was just the right amount of hollandaise on the dish. The salad complimented the dish very well and was exactly what I was looking for. Tom's Urban sports a very casual and relaxing vibe after a night of craziness. The staff was very friendly and I had a positive experience overall.  Cons: However, as with most things in life there are a couple things I was not a fan of. After being seated the waiter asked if we would like a bottle of water, as if it was the only option. We said yes to the bottle and were a bit irritated to see that it was $7.00 on the bill. He made no mention of price. We also ordered a homemade poptart to start with (very tasty). Apparently they have different fillings every day and we were not told what the filling of the day was. We ended up liking it, but it is nice to know what you're getting yourself into. In addition, someone else got fresh berries atop theirs, we are not sure if they forgot ours or they requested...the world may never know. Lastly, although the food was very good it was also very expensive. I would come again, but sparingly due to the price.",

The wings were fatty and not good at all. I think my husband ate two. The steak didn't seem like steak (imagine Taco Bell steak and that's what it taste like, and the fries looked like they were frozen and not fresh cut. Our waitress was awesome, that's the ONLY reason I'm giving them two stars! After a tip, we were really upset we paid over $90 for a meal that you could of gotten at Taco Bell or Sheetz for $10! VERY VERY Disappointed!!!!!!!",

My kind of joint really.    Service was okay - she was right on time and just as she should be.  Not super friendly, but that doesn't bother me.    Two of the four of us had sandwiches and they were enormous!  I had the carnitas tacos and they were delicious, nothing memorable, but they were good.  I loved the fried pickles and chicken wings we ordered for appetizers too!  Great options on adult beverages . . . . truly no complaints whatsoever!",

    "text": "Went there with my boyfriend for an impromptu casual dinner. The outdoor seating area and cool decor appealed to us, as did the rather varied menu.   Liked: the terrace decor with its high tables, colorful lanterns, elaborate bar with cobalt, turquoise and pink hanging bottles. Plus the view of the Vegas strip without all the noise - a nice compromise between feeling the Vegas vibe but getting a bit of peace too. It was a fresh, welcome change from stuffy and formal hotel restaurants. Also liked the fact that they did not shy away from using condiments and spices in the food: both our dishes had a nice kick to them. The soft drinks were refilled for free which was a nice surprise. Our waitress was well-informed and efficient.   Disliked/ could have been better: the food albeit tasty lacked that wow factor. My chicken tacos were not served as piping hot as I would have liked them to be (which i.a. made them look a bit trite) and the chicken carried a little too much fatty skin (I found myself examining each piece and cleaning it up before eating it). The leaves in my boyfriend's salad looked a little tired and weren't as crunchy and fresh as they could have been. My rhum and ginger beer/ lemon drink tasted ok but I would have expected the ginger beer to make it extra fizzy - instead it was kind of flat.  Overall, an ok dining experience - if I went back I'd try other dishes to get a better idea of the restaurant's True pedigree.",

Everyone enjoyed their food, service was great for us (fast seating, good service, drinks kept coming). I still wish I hadn't had a moscow mule (my fridge is now full of ginger beer and my cabinet full of vodka).   The highlight for me was definitely the braised short ribs and cheddar polenta. so delicious and satisfying in the way that only something with real fat in it can be. Even thinking about it my mouth is watering. I wish I were in vegas more often so I could go through the rest of the menu. I recommend going with at least three friends so you can all have something different and try each others. Take your time and enjoy their cocktails, they were all great.",

I drink peets coffee everyday and their 'peets' coffee doesn't taste like peets. It's very watered down. I asked for a fresh pot and it was still weak. Maybe the coffee is old or something because it had a hint of dirt flavor.  Our neighbor also complained that their breakfast had no flavor. They ordered a Bailey's coffee and when complaining that it doesn't taste like Bailey's the bartender came to the table to explain that they've been out of Bailey's for a week and they used something else instead.    Bottom line, their ingredients are cheap and they obviously don't care.",

For meat lovers, this is a good point. But as a waitress your job is not to judge or lecture your visitors. My friend felt bad at ordered an appetizer instead. I ordered half sweet potato fries and half regular fries with a side of the avocado chicken tacos.  The food arrived around 25 minutes later and super cold. I would've kindly asked the waitress for warmer food but she just dumped the food on our table and left as fast as she could. We didn't see her for another 20 minutes. I wanted some ranch to make the food a little edible since I hate wasting food. I went up to the host and asked for ranch (our waitress was still mia) but with even more attitude she answered \"your waitress can get you that\".

When I pointed them out to her she said we could sit there. Strange. We ordered the Baja Fish Tacos which was in the entree section of the menu. It took 35 min to get our food. The waiter was very apologetic and explained that they were short staffed. That was fine except when we got the tacos there were 3 tiny mini fish tacos....kinda like an appetizer. 2 bites and it was gone. I wish I took a picture. They didn't have much flavor and was ok. Btw....$16.99 for 3 mini mini tacos. No side dish, nothing.  We have no problem spending money for good food which this was not. What a waste. Maybe it was what we ordered. Just an FYI.",

We were excited to try a bunch of the foods off of their trendy looking menu, and for the most part, the foods were what we expected.  When It comes down to it though, the food just just good, not amazing, but still good.  We definitely got what we payed for and I don't regret coming here, but I am in no hurry to return here.",

    "text": "OK. So we came here because my friend and I were in the area because we wanted to see Zumanity. I got the tom's butcher steak. now it didn't really label what kind of cut it was but they stated it was a butcher cut so I said what the heck.  Come to find out it was a shoulder cut. Not really what I was expecting but it looked good. The chef properly prepared it. It was cooked to a rare and cut on a bias. Unfortunately there was not enough salt on the steak to taste good but there was pink sea salt shaker on the tablet which provided a mild salty taste. The steak was beautifully cooked. The salad was nothing to write home about. It was a blue cheese salad with baby romaine lettuce that complimented the steak well. the bread that the steak was sitting on was so delicious. Usually I don't eat those thingsbut somehow they made it taste good.  Now I got garlic fries and these are pretty good. I have to admit that the garlic taste was very splotchy. Some of the fries had a parm taste. Some had a garlic taste. some had both and some had none? but overall it tasted phenomenally.  I probably would have gone for the nyny strip next time because I could choose my side, but  this was nothing bad. The environment was nice and urban/beachy. awesome 80s\\90s music was playing in the background with music videos. Totally would go here again.",

It's probably the best choice out of the places in the New York New York hotel though!   //TREEHUGGER BENEDICT (3/5): The definition of just o.k... One of my eggs had already been popped by the time the dish got to my table, the English muffins were too hard, and the hollandaise sauce has literally 0 flavor. AND it was an extra $2 to add bacon. On the bright side, the $2 were well spent because the bacon was cooked perfectly - chewy, crunchy, and not too oily. Also, the avocados were plentiful and super fresh. However, the one thing that completely saved this dish was the AMAZING HASH BROWNS! They were mixed with some cheesy goodness to make the potatoes really stringy and chewy, but not overwhelming... They were the best hash browns I've ever had at a brunch restaurant.   //LEMON POPPYSEED BLUEBERRY PANCAKES (4.5/5): Suuuuper good and something I would definitely get again! It comes with sweet cream and salted caramel butter, which offered additional flavor to the already super lemony pancakes! I have really high standards for pancakes so I was impressed - it tasted like a lemon muffin but in pancake form! I just wish the pancake was toasted a little more so that the outside would be a little crispier.   Basically, 2 defining items at this restaurant were the hash browns and the pancakes. But great service and environment! :)",

I can't comment on the food, unfortunately, since the hostess decided to completely disregard my reservation and give me serious attitude. Long story short, I made a reservation requesting a view of the Golden Knights playoff game...in Vegas...I was lied to online and on the phone. The hostess put us in a corner, no view of the TV, and told me my only option was sitting there or leaving. Look, you don't want my business, that's fine...just don't lie to me on the phone or waste my time. Tom's Urban sucks, especially the hostess.",

However after that we did not see any service for 30 minutes, not even water glasses or table settings. After flagging down the hostess, not the server who we never met, finally got water/drinks and food ordered. All of our food came in a relatively ok time after that. My friends had sandwiches and salads which had good portions and they did tell me were good. My wife had duck wings which were okay. I ordered the chicken and cornbread pancake which was described as a cornbread pancake with a large serving of fried boneless chicken, basically like standard chicken and waffles but with a pancake. What I got though was a giant cornbread pancake which tasted great, but then there was 4 tiny chicken \"nuggets\" on top. So basically I got a pancake with some chicken for garnish, not what one would expect when ordering a chicken and waffle/pancake dish. +1 star for clean okay atmosphere, -1 for my order, -2 for no service... still never knew who our server was supposed to be.",

The food was tasty and we had a good time. The issue was with the time it took to get food. I am patient when a place is busy, but this was far past acceptable. Our bartender and the manager were both attentive and took care of us while we waited. That is why they get three stars instead of one or two.  The first thing I tried was the Asadero Hash Brown. They are great. The textures and flavors are spot on. These are a very good side for any meal.  Next up were the Buffalo Chicken Sliders. These are exactly like they sound. No need for further description. The buns, meat and sauce are good. These  are a nice appetizer.  The last thing I tried was the Sticky Belly Steamed Buns. These are steamed buns filled with pork belly, Asian peanut slaw and green onion. They normally come with cilantro as well, but I hate cilantro so requested them without it.  If they can get the kitchen figured out we will certainly visit regularly during our Las Vegas visits.",

    "text": "Overall, this is one of the worst experiences I have had on the strip. Exceptionally low quality food, mediocre service, poor serving choices (plastic cups!?), and WAY overpriced. Avoid at all costs.   First of all, EXPENSIVE. EXPENSIVE. Yes it's on the strip and yes I understand it's a tourist trap, but I'm not a tourist I'm a local. If you're a local, stay far away from this place. There are spots on the strip that don't charge exorbitant prices just because they can. This is not one of those spots. This place just wants your money.  I ordered \"Al Carbon\" steak nachos and a milkshake. Let's start with the milkshake.  First, it came out in a plastic cup. A Solo cup-sized plastic cup, and it wasn't full. Second, it is quite thick, and comes with the same straws they use for the water. I can't drink it without the straw because I'll look like some kind of milk-mustached 3 year old. I can't use a spoon because there weren't any on the table. I can't use the straw it came with because the straw is far too small and the shake is much too thick. A buddy of mine grabbed me a big straw from the restaurant next door on his way in. The flavor was not good, just super sweet. A low-quality shake for sure. And on top of not being able to drink it, and not being very good, and being a very small quantity of shake in a plastic cup, it costs $8. WHAT A JOKE.  Steak nachos were awful. The meat was overcooked and poorly seasoned. The quality of the meat itself was extremely low. I asked for no cilantro, it came out covered in cilantro. The cheese and cheese sauce combination was terrible. The chips were cheap junk. There is nothing good to say about them. They also cost $18.  Our server was nice enough; she made a couple jokes and we got along fine, but she really didn't care about us as customers. She saw when she came by to refill drinks that I hadn't touched my nachos. (Because they were awful.) She never asked if they were alright (they were disgusting), she never asked if anything was wrong with them (they were covered in cilantro after I asked her for none), in fact the only thing she ever asked me about them was if I was finished. She didn't ask if I wanted a box when she came to take them away, so she obviously knew I was unhappy with them. Same lack of interest for all the others I was with.",

We were looking for somewhere close since they were staying at Excalibur Hotel. I mentioned Tom's Urban. It great spot for family dining open area, diverse menu (even have kids menu), and something that don't see back in 808. It just walk across the street. So they were down for it. I was excited go back not that I never got my fix in or tasted enough of the menu. It always good idea go back after yelp event get honest opinion minus all the special treatment.   Me I would give it 4.5 star review. The ambience was the same vibe one that really enjoy the spacious dining room, my niece and nephews LOVED that fact had wide screens all spread out in the restaurant (one that was playing music videos; yup like they even made music videos anymore!?!?!?), so keep the kids interested cause late at night they were fading from long day of soccer tournament day, and the wood decor is awesome more so when understand the history behind it. Our server not sure if she worked the yelp event looked familiar. She was awesome, love the excitement she brings to her job, friendly, passionate, upbeat, free spirit, professional, and interactive with the kids. She notice my nephew soccer warm up jacket and was asking if they were here for soccer tournament. She plays soccer herself and was telling us about tournament she went down to AZ of recently or something. The bottom line was love the interaction she engaged with us. It make the whole experience that much more memorable plus she is very professional. We never had empty glasses answered all of my family questions since was their first time, and was on it.   Food I ended up going with familiar dish one that had at yelp event. I went with the street tacos. I went with three combination of pork belly and two al carbon. You can order one, two, three, or all five different ones. That was way too much food. It was delicious. It tasted just as good as just few days prior at yelp event. My family visiting they had couple of pizzas, grilled cheese, and chicken fingers. They all enjoyed their food. The only thing would say is the chicken fingers not that eye appealing but then again plain old chicken fingers.   The only reason fell short of yelp perfection was we must have been the only people at the restaurant. We got there late around 10pm surprise for Saturday night kind of empty. We got seated fast, server she was prompt, awesome, and on it. Once she put the order in no fault of hers took over thirty minutes. I could understand if was swamped but the place was empty. Anyway long day we were all starving so might have been short but we left the restaurant past 11pm. Server apologize. It nothing that would stop me from coming back or bringing out of town visitors for some of the ono grinds.",

Slow service, especially for how slow restaurant was and for what we ordered. Food wasn't great either. Had hummus trio. Hummus was fine but toast points I was give were stale. It was pretty gross.   I would pass on this place, better places in the same area.",

The decor of the restaurant is awesome. It's immediately apparent a lot of thought and money has gone into designing a space that's comfortable and fun. Our server was very friendly and knowledgable about the foods on their menu.  We ordered the Crispy Duck Wings, Ginger Chicken Pot Stickers, \"Sticky\" Belly Steamed Buns and the Carnitas Cuban Sandwich. Although on the pricey side, their food is definitely flavorful. We really enjoyed all of the dishes. Only the duck wings gave us a slight pause. The wings were good, but I would have liked to have been able to taste the duck a little bit more. The sauce was somewhat overpowering. But overall, an excellent culinary experience.",

We also tried the homemade pop tarts. Flaky crust, loved it! It was my first time, and since breakfast is the one meal I definitely eat I'm always looking for a delicious breakfast. They serve Peet's coffee, and it will wake you up!  Now I normally eat breakfast at Hexx (formerly the Sugar Factory) every time I'm in Vegas. But this place definitely gives them a run for the money. Bonus they have nice patio seating. Perfect for people watchers like myself.   Service was good. Everyone was really nice and attentive (I'm big on service, a former server myself! My college jobs). Bad service automatically drops to three stars regardless of the food.  Nice decor.   Ambiance!   I definitely will be back. I have to try the Mac and cheese before I leave.",

    "text": "Items Selected: Coffee Colorado Hot Brown - Shaved turkey and smoked pit ham on sourdough, smothered with pork green chile, pepper jack and cheddar cheese, tomato, applewood-smoked bacon; served with sweet potato fries and jerk ketchup Blueberry Buttermilk Pancakes with Caramel Butter Big Carrot Cake - Six layers of carrot cake with cream cheese, pecans + fresh toasted coconut  Newly opened at New York New York, and apparently part of a trio with additional locations found in Larimer and Los Angeles, Tom's Urban is not exactly the sort of restaurant one would rush to during opening week yet with the words \"Hot Brown\" featured prominently on the breakfast menu the sprawling space spilling onto the Strip immediately became a destination, a 6:30 arrival finding the kitchen just firing up as I sat in the two-hundred-plus person room with only the GM, Bartender, and a lovely server named Melissa during a seventy-five minute stay.  Recently redesigned, with urban-rustic flourishes including unfinished ceilings with globe lights above cement floors speckled with plenty of wood and glass, the general feel of Tom's Urban is of the lively variety and with plenty of LCDs showing a variety of sports the biggest flaw is that the game volume is rendered mute, the restaurant instead opting to blare Iggy Azalea and Taylor Swift at levels clearly intended to draw in traffic from the strip.  Featuring a 'late night and breakfast' menu from 11:00pm until an hour before noon the dining options at Tom's run the gamut of 'global' cuisine and with at least fifty selections available there were tough choices to be made - Las Vegas Boulevard pricing yielding $10-for-3 flapjacks and the aforementioned Hot Brown for $21, the $3 cup of coffee kept brimming throughout the meal the only real \"bargain,\" though aside from False-maple syrup the ingredients were high quality all around.  Waiting and watching Kirk Herbstreit's mouth move while Katy Perry's voice poured from speakers overhead it was perhaps fifteen minutes before two plates arrived and greeted by the GM during that time suffice it to say that neither portion was skimpy, the bursting blueberries amongst buttermilk batter not really benefitted by upsold butter but light, fluffy, and flavorful when gilded with syrup brought from home while the \"Denver\" take on the Louisville staple was anything but authentic with a bold spice profile only serving to enhance the smoky sapor of pork alongside moist turkey on thick, buttery bread.  Originally told that desserts were only available at dinner, but pleading my case that Carrot Cake is a perfectly rational post-breakfast treat, it was with 'best I've ever had' promises from my server that the moist slice arrived and although certainly not quite matching the high standards set by Jerry's Nugget or Citizens the $9 six-layer selection was still quite impressive with a restrained spice profile still allowed to shine by keeping the frosting less sweet than most, a spin that may appeal to those desiring a more savory dessert.  Clearly suffering from Strip-style pricing (and unwilling to offer this info online) those sitting down for a meal at Tom's Urban are likely to find something they enjoy from the wide ranging menu and although several similar \"upscale American\" restaurants exist throughout Las Vegas none of them are serving a Hot Brown of any form, nor Duck Wings or an interesting selection of street tacos, before dawn.",

The hostess was rude and her attitude appeared as you were bothering her.  The waiter seemed more interested in sitting with the table behind us chit chatting for a good five minutes per visit instead of taking our order or checking on how we were doing.  We got a glass of ice water that had cilantro stuck on the glass.  Decided on ordering one of \"Tom's Favs\" which was their steak nachos and also their mahi mahi fish tacos.  Nothing special about the nachos...it had multi color tortilla chips, cheddar cheese sauce, SOME shredded cheese, leftover steak (you can taste that it wasn't fresh), a tiny serving each of guacamole paste and dressing, sour cream, and a little bit of salsa.  The fish tacos were extremely dry...no sauce or anything to go with it.  Just the fish, some lettuce or cabbage and a lime wedge on top of a corn tortilla.  Overall, the atmosphere was nice, but the table set ups were kinda weird.  I guess they want to be \"different\" and to each their own.  I think it could be a happening place if their service and food was better.  For the price you pay ($21.95 for a burger by itself) you would think this place would be more upscale and have amazing food to brag about, but it's not and they don't.",

After checking out the menu options we made this selection because of the wide variety. I had the Chimichuri Steak and fries, my husband had the Cuban and fries. First off, there is ZERO chimichuri sauce served with this meal. I asked the waitress if she could bring some and she advised that they do not serve chimichuri sauce anymore, only a vinaigrette dressing that is included. The steak was over done and the fries were very cold and stale. My husband was happy with the Cuban, which is my reason I am even giving one star however, again, his fries were horrible due to being cold and stale tasting. I brought this to the attention of the server she did take my meal away and took it off the bill. I would not recommend this restaurant despite the great location.

We were a group of 6, we came here to eat and have a few drinks on Halloween before a show, the tab was around $186, my 5 friends all put down cash and I had a card, we told our server, Bernadette, we wanted to pay cash and put the rest on my card which was about $56. I assumed this was a common thing that any server can do but when I got the receipt back she charged the whole bill to my card and tried to pocket all the cash. This is not OK! I will never go back to this place they hire SCAMMERS! We called her out and she knew exactly what she did. If you go to this place make sure to double check your bill because they will try and get over on you.",

Instead of going to a crowded bar to watch, we went here as it was not crowded. Now, I understand why it was not crowded. I was not very impressed with their choice of food but drinks and service were good. The waiter seemed discouraging on questions about their dishes. The prices for appetizers were a little too much if you ask me. We wanted to spend money on apps since we would stay to watch the game but that didn't happen..   The Colorado Calamari we ordered was small and super salty. I didn't like the breading they used or the sauce. I basically ate most of the jalapenos in the dish. We also ordered Buffalo wings. Very little for what we paid. The wings were pretty decent but it was just coated well with the buffalo sauce. Again, it had the same sauce as the Colorado Calamari that I didn't like. We didn't want to try anymore as after those two apps, it might be the same. We had their drinks. I ordered the 32oz souvenir cup with their Sin City Punch. The drink was ok. After awhile the coconut milk was separating and started to taste weird. I liked the souvenir cup but it was plastic and I paid $32 for this? I am not sure I would go back here. I can tell the food is not all that especially for the bill we got at the end. The service was the best part and able to watch the game. Go Warrior's!! =)",

The sugar in the sauce was caramelized from the cooking process.    The outdoors space is urban and bright. The seats have funky bright colors that gives the space a fun vibe. The space is airy and open. The open outdoor space has an overhead of showering water heads. The outdoor bar is open and large.   I highly recommend this place.",

It really big and spacious. We had made reservations at 11pm but we arrived an hour early. When we arrived there wasn't anyone one in the front. We waited about 5 mins and the hostess helped us. She was really nice and she took us to our table. Our waitress Evelyn came and asked for our drinks. I asked for a lemonade and my husband a blue moon beer (40oz). She was really nice and gave excellent service. We decided to order Adobe chicken tacos, pizza, lobster Mac and cheese. We also ordered dessert, cheese cake! Everything was really good, beyond delicious. The chicken tacos are so perfect you can either order them with flour or corn tortillas. The lobster Mac and cheese was delicious with great favors. When we were a lot done eating the restaurant manager was also helping us. I didn't get his name but he was really nice to us. Thanks for a great dinner!",

Looked like a decent option, with bright, hip decor, loud music and a big menu.  Unfortunately, the mediocre service and high prices made for a real letdown. We waited a while for a server to show up, and after she did, a second different server showed up and took over. I ordered the \"limoncello\" chicken wings and was pretty shocked to get 5 skimpy wings for the $14 price tag. Two thumbs up for the side of street corn that I ordered extra. It was the only redeeming part of the meal.  Though, they screwed up the order and brought me tater tots instead.  My wife ordered a chicken sandwich that came with avocado, but it was missing from the sandwich (I'm starting to think this isn't a coincidence, as this is the third time recently that the kitchen overlooks this). No biggie, except that it took a while to get it brought out.  The table next to us was having similar issues, with slow service, cold fries, and other randomness.  Maybe this place is a better option during their afternoon or late night happy hours.  At 2pm on a Saturday, it's a real drag.  No thanks.",

The mug is taller with a small circumference than normal so it's probably the same volume as any other Moscow mule.

My friend ordered the Lobster Tacos and they were delicious. I saw so many things on that huge menu I'd love to try. Very good and pleasant service too. The drinks were high priced but not as pricey as the drinks at the Park Theater. I'm looking forward to eating at Tom's Urban again. Meals range from $10 to $25",

The worst part was the hummus which you can get anywhere, nothing bad about it, just nothing great. The Sandwich though was delicate and violent at the same time.  I ordered exta fig jam and did a little expirements with fig to cheese to to bacon and found moments of pure culinary bliss.

We weren't given water till our food came out 40 mins later. The food portions are way too big and quality is mediocre at best. Something as simple as french fries were undercooked, too crispy/stale and cold. You can usually tell when there are too many items on a menu that the food itself won't be good. Barely any vegetarian options. This is my second time at Tom's Urban (went to LA one and LV now). I won't be coming back unless I have no other choice.",

Pot stickers arrived and tasted like they had freezer burn, The beef in my tacos ended up being pork with a chalky fried liver texture, the salsa was just present for color. I advised the waitress that my tacos were pork, and easily shredded a chunk of the chalky substance to show her the white meat. She said it can't be pork, and looked at me like I was an idiot.  I decided I was not going to gamble on whatever else came out of the kitchen. In retrospect Toms Urban is a bar, that thaws out food served by barmaids. I will recommend it if you want a 12 ounce, 7 dollar draft domestic beer. The food is better at a fast food joint.",

But first, I'll tell you the best thing about this place...their sauce for the calamari. Okay. Now back to the crap.   Food was terrible. Ordered a medium done burger, got charred well done. Partner ordered a well done burger got medium rare. Friend got a chicken sandwich, chicken was dry as a bone. Shrimp was slimey and garbage.  Don't waste your money. I know it's convenient being in your hotel, but seriously--I wish I would've walked down the strip more and spent my time at a place that has better service and better food. period.",

    "text": "We came here tonight for a parents and team dinner...first off we made a reservation for a party of 40 people and they acted like we were a party of 2 people trying to check in. It started with when we called to check in for our reservations and they acted totally weird and asked why didn't we go through events management? Seriously why didn't you ask this 2 months ago when we made the reservations? Then when we showed up they wanted to split up our party even though the restaurant was totally dead. Even more disappointing was the management team didn't even come over to even deal with it. But to be honest our waitress Ashley B and Jose did an outstanding job getting us all in one area and taking care of us...for me they made up for all the shortcomings!   The food fell a little short in my opinion and was just ok...and pretty expensive for what you get for 4 people and 2 beers was $110 and one daughter got fries for dinner? Beers are $8.50 a piece as much as a meal!",

The food here is excellent, filling, and beautifully presented. My family and I opted to have the breakfast menu option. I choose the BLT-ECM( egg,cheese, mayo). It was packed full of each ingredient. They use applewood smoked bacon and fresh lettuce and tomatoes, all on toasted sourdough bread. It's also served with Asedero hash browns( asedero is a mild cheese). The sandwich was delicious. It looked and tasted amazing. So much so, both my son and my husband requested I \"cut\" a piece for them to try. The small bite they had left each of them wishing they had opted for the BLT as well!   The seating is abundant with a natural flow to the arrangement. A party of 1,4, 7, 10 could all be easily acclimated with opportunity to still remain near your party for conversation and enjoyment.  The staff are pleasant and take great care of each customer.",

We walked past them and located our friends. We sat down at a two top next to our friends and ordered our drinks. The waitress was very nice and attentive, it was 4 pm and there was about 4/5 tables of people. We ordered the Prime rib sandwich and the chicken caesars salad. About 15 minutes later one of the hostesses approached us and asked do you have a reservation? We said no, she said that our table was reserved and we would have to leave???? The restaurant was almost empty. We told her we already ordered, she told our friends, who already had their food, to pick it up and she was going to relocate us all. Pretty embarrassing for all involved. We cancelled our order and went to Gallagers for a great dinner. I can't comment on the quality of the food, nor will I ever be able to. I will never go there again.",

He added some bacon on for an up charge, and he could not stop telling me how tasty the bacon was. Be aware, the portion is huge...you get three very large pancakes! Unfortunately, he was unable to finish his meal but it was so delicious. I loved my eggs Benedict and liked the touch with the green onions garnished on there. My meal came with hash browns, which were also tasty. Additionally, I thought the prices for breakfast here were incredibly fair considering the location.

We initially were going to go to a place further down the strip but the menu and food looked good here. From the moment we sat down to the moment we left we had the most amazing service.   Mike our server was extremely knowledgeable, warm and friendly. He made our experience here perfect. Service in Vegas is sometime a hit or miss and barely ever memorable but I am pretty sure we will be requesting him the next time we come back.  We ordered the Crispy Duck Wings to start. These were delicious! They were crispy and juicy. The flavor was amazing too, just the right amount of kick. The sauce is hella sticky so ask for extra napkins.   I ordered the Shrimp and Grits, they were freaking amazing. The Shrimp were plump and juicy, the grits were creamy, luscious and cheesy. Everything went very well together with a spicy sauce and thick cut bacon bits to top it all off. My love ordered the chicken which was also pretty amazing. Crunchy and full of flavor. The chicken portion is humongous so order with care.  Mike made sure we had everything we needed throughout our meal, the manager even came by to check up on us. The service was just great and the food was even better.   Mike informed us Tom's is coming to Oregon which is closer to Seattle. I can't wait to come back!",

    "text": "04/09/17  Decided to grab something to eat on a Sunday night at the New York New York Casino. It was close to midnight.  All of the other restaurants around the market were already closed except this one.    Kudos to our server Ruth who provided a great dining experience to us first timers.    My wife and I ordered the Crispy Brussels Sprouts, Lobster & Shrimp Mac & Cheese, and the Prime Rib Sliders.   Crispy Brussels Sprouts (v) - Red peppers, Asian vinaigrette  At first we thought is was just your ordinary Brussels Sprouts until I took a sprout deep inside the bowl.  I took my first bite and thought, \"What the hell is that?!\"  I noticed that the Asian vinaigrette was sitting at the bottom and sprouts that soaked in more of this sauce took the flavor to another level.  I asked my wife to try it again with more sauce and she agreed.    Lobster & Shrimp Mac & Cheese - creamy mac & cheese with butter-poached lobster & shrimp  This is a very big portion!  A great serving size for 2 people. Once it hits your table you can see the shrimp and lobster sitting on top of the creamy macaroni.  It is a very filling dish and tastes great right off the line.  I would recommend eating it as soon as you get it so the cheese stays creamy and doesn't thicken up during your meal.  Prime Rib Sliders - Slow roasted & shaved prime rib topped with beef rosemary demi-glace, natural Havarti cheese, crispy haystack onions  You get 3 sliders with this order,  It can be a meal for 1 person or good for sharing with 2.  It was a tiny bit on the greasy side for us, but since we had the Brussels Sprouts it all worked out.  I would like to try the other options of sliders on their menu before ordering this again. With that said, this was an okay dish for us.    Overall, I give this place a 4 for the dishes and the service that was provided. I would like to go back there and try out the other items they have to offer.  This is based on our experience and our palette. So your taste buds might say otherwise.",

    "text": "My summer fishing buddy back on Cape Cod in 1976 was named Tom. This was the summer after Jaws took the world by storm, so the vibe on the Cape at that time was surreal. I'd liken it to San Francisco just 7 years prior but I wasn't there at the time (Vietnam). Anyway Tom and I spent a lot of time out on this little schooner in '76 tossing back beers and talking about fishing, about the war, and about bathrooms. Typical guy stuff. Tom would join Gloria and I at Seafood Sam's for fried clams (decent bathrooms there). After the summer of '76 Tom kind of dropped off the map. We didn't have the Facebooks back then so it's not like we could easily stay in touch. The only Tweeters we had were on our quadraphonic sound system loudspeakers :)  I like to think maybe Tom moved out west and started his own restaurant chain. Typical American pub fare with beers and whatnot. Called it Tom's Urban. Turns out this Tom's Urban was started by a guy named Tom who also has a company that makes really flat griddled hamburgers. That doesn't sound like my ex-Gunnery Sergeant turned fishing buddy Tom. Trust me, my Tom wouldn't make a bathroom as despicable as the one at Tom's Urban on the strip in Vegas. We spent too much time on that little schooner off the Cape talking BRs (bathrooms) for him to have designed the literal \"S\"-hole I discovered at Tom's Urban.  Being that I was in town for the Indoor Ag-Con this past April (the \"Are container farms economically viable for commercial production\" session was riveting!) I needed to eat somewhere on the Strip relatively close to the Convention Center. Some Con buddies of mine and I (fellow green thumbs) chose to unwind after a long day of Conning with the Tom's urban Happy Hour. We requested outdoor seating on the patio overlooking the Strip near New York New York Casino and Resort. Our request was initially denied, but after a table of tourists paid their bill we were offered a great corner table on the patio.  You'll want to ask your server the location of the bathroom upon being seated. You won't see much of her during service and the beer offerings are a bit watered down (I gave up Old Style years ago, I'm a Belgian Quad man now). The sprawling bar and restaurant requires a bit of a hike to get to the bathroom. But once you find it (walk to the back, turn this-a-way, then that-a-way) you're in for a shock.  Tom's Urban, with it's seemingly hundreds of dining tables, countertops and bar seats, has ONE single-use bathroom for men. So, like, if you chose Tom's Urban as your desired destination to watch the upcoming Super Bowl (2017) you'd probably be fighting hundreds of gentleman for the privilege of relieving yourself in ONE. SINGLE. TOILET.  For what it's worth, the bathroom was quite clean and orderly. Nice tiles. Aromas of pine and citrus, with only a touch of chemical acidity. A low seated toilet (which is passable because I didn't have to sit to do my business this time) with a push-button flusher (which I later found out was also automatic, but that's besides the point). The problem with the push-button flusher is that in most men's rooms the toilet seat is ALWAYS in the upright position. It's almost impossible (with paper towels or toilet paper in hand) to hit the push-button flusher without some portion of your hand hitting the upright toilet seat. GROSS. The sink features both hot and cold faucets, with the requisite foam-y soap dispenser (whether it was anti-bacterial or not I do not know) nearby. Once again - and it seems like I always have to say this - if you're going to offer the option of air dryers, which most of today's youth prefer to a good old fashioned paper towel - you can't only have a bathroom door that opens into the bathroom. How many people do you think wash and dry their hands only to soil them again pulling the door open to exit the bathroom with their bare hands? I'll tell you who WON'T ever make that mistake. Me.  Until we can find a restaurateur who is forward-thinking enough to design an ergonomically sound bathroom that caters to the person who wants to come in contact with the least amount of surfaces possible, deplorable bathrooms like those at Tom's Urban chain of fast casual restaurants will continue to proliferate.  The Nashville Hot Chicken was delightfully spicy. The \"XL\" size was more than enough for one human male. I heard the Boulder Club was \"okay\" but \"sloppy\". The beer selection left much to be desired. Guinness and Shock Top? C'mon Tom, get your act together. Maybe next time (if they fix the bathroom issues I experienced) I'll try the mac and cheese skillet. It looked tasty.",

The drinks were just ok. I ordered an Old Fashion and it was watered down and the other drink a Mexican Mule was too sweet. I ordered the Carnitas Cuban Sandwich. The sandwich was more like a ham sandwich. Carnitas to me means fried chunks of pork not a slice of ham. The other entree we got was the chimicheree steak which was ok. Not much flavor to it but the the meat was soft. We were too hungry to complain and ask for something else so we just went with it.",

We ordered the burrito, but unfortunately it came back cold. We told them and they took it back to \"remake\"- again cold. I think these are pre-made burritos because the outside was always hot but the inside always cold.. Like when you microwave a hot pocket! Also: carnitas sandwich had no shredded pork- purely ham.  Ambiance: urban eatery- just what you'd expect from the name :P  Price: overpriced for what you get. $17+ burgers; couple small plate items for $7-9. They're nothing unique in terms of their dishes (buffalo chicken sliders, Brussels sprouts, etc). Not to mention the poor quality control.  Service: they took back the burrito when we told them it was cold. But you'd think they'd check to make sure it didn't happen again...",

I feel like I can't give a full review as we only came for breakfast and had the basics (eggs, bacon and hash browns). The music was good and uplifting (especially after a long night in Vegas).   Probably would have given them 4 stars had the waiters been a little nicer and faster. We didn't have much contact with the 2-3 waiters who helped up. The food took quite some time to come out. We both had the simplest of breakfasts and it didn't seem that busy.  Maybe it was just a one time flook. I loved the ambiance and the food was good so I'd probably give it another shot and even recommend to try it,",

We ordered duck wings, chicken pot stickers, buffalo chicken sliders, fillet mignon sliders, and shoestring fries.  So the food came out pretty quickly and  it was pretty good.  Our favorite was definitely the buffalo chicken sliders.  The filet mignon sliders had to be my least favorite.  I found that the meat was a little tough.  The reason why I gave three stars is because 5 small plates and 2 soda's came out to $80 which seemed a little steep, even by Vegas standards.  I really wanted to try to the taco's but it was 3 taco's for close to $17.  So this is in the middle.  Good food, not so great price",

We started with the Brussels sprouts. Excellent. I had the Crispy Chicken & Cornbread Pancake. Very flavorful. The chicken a little TOO crispy. I'd go back to Tom's, but order something different.",

While in Vegas all I've been craving was buffalo wings so that's what I ordered. I ordered a drink during happy hour and waited for my food. When it arrived I received honey bbq wings and my Mac n cheese. I sent back the honey bbq because it wasn't what I ordered. When I finally got my buffalo wings they were all cold but the plate was hot to give you the illusion your food was warm I guess. Spoke to the manager and got that taken off my tab. After this the waitress completely ignored my table. When we were finally able to ask for our checks we get it back and they charged us the full price for our drinks that were on happy hour special. Be careful! The table next to us ALSO were charged full price for their drinks when it was during happy hour. We told our terrible waitress and got our tabs changed (again). We got our tabs back and finally my receipt was correct. However my friends tab upon receiving it had the happy hour price for his drinks but when he got his card back he was charged the full price.... sketchy! Needless to say I never do this but I left no tip. Sorry service, decent Mac n cheese, cold wings, utter disappointment, trendy ambiance, sketchy tabs! All in all make sure you check your receipts and hope you get warm wings and a warm plate! Oh did I forget to mention my friend found a hair in his Mac n cheese? Yeah... that happened. Gross.",

The inside dining area has round booths that can probably accomodate about 8 people. Service was fast and friendly and we got our drink order pretty quickly.   I ordered the Filet Mignon Steak & Eggs. The steak was cooked perfectly (medium-rare), and had a delicious, melt-in-your-mouth consistency. Unfortunately, that was the only part of the meal that I liked. I specified over-medium for the eggs, but they came out looking fried - no chance of getting any runny yoke here. The hash browns were a bit tough. As though it were cooked by three different people. Too bad. Those things ruined an otherwise tasty dish.  My girl had the Truffled Maine Lobster Roll, which is basically a lobster sandwich. The sandwich was good - lobster tasted fresh. It would have would have been nice if they included a lemon wedge with it, so that you can squeeze it over the lobster. Also, toasting the outside would have given the texture of the sandwich a little more contrast. I didn't see if that option was on the menu, but I would ask for this if I were to order this sandwich again.  Overall, this experience was kind of meh, but I'd be willing to give this place another shot - maybe.",

We were sat on the patio with a great view of the strip but that's where the fun ends.  Our server was a jerk.  He handed us menus with a happy our listed so we decided to order a couple of drinks from that.  I think it was 1 min past the time or something but he made a snarky comment about the time and that we can no longer order from the happy hour menu.  I ordered a beer and the wife ordered a mixed drink.  We also wanted to order an appetizer but it took forever for the server to come back.  Once he did we ordered the fried pickles.  We checked in on Yelp and we were given a coupon for fried pickles.  I'm not a guy that's always looking for a deal but if I have one I am going to use it.  When we got our bill the total was over $35 for 1 beer, 1 mixed drink and pickles that were in a tiny little metal serving dish.  I gave the server my yelp coupon only to get another snarky comment about how that expired in April and he's tired of people trying to use it.  I'm sorry dude.  I JUST checked in and your coupon popped up.  He said he would honor it if I went on Yelp and left him a great review.  Here's the thing.  Your service was terrible.  We all had 1 drink because you never came back.  No you do not get a great review.  Next time we are in Vegas we will skip this joint.",

    "text": "Tom's Urban is a relaxed, beer-focused, modern-dive-bar type place.   I stood by the hostess stand for a while until it was clear no one was coming, so I sat myself and the inside bar where it seemed a bit more quiet and relaxed. I'm not sure if it was because it was a Sunday night, but this place was pretty empty and a fairly casual place, which is a nice departure from the glitz, glam, and LOUD that you normally find on the strip.   I was excited to see about 40 taps of draft beer. Of course, the beer was a little pricier than I am used to, but it was nice to drink something other than domestic bottles from the casino floor. I appreciated that they had a printed beer list that appeared to be up to date.   I ordered some steak nachos that were not that great. I mostly ate only the chips that had cheese baked on them, and left the other trimmings on the plate. The order is definitely large enough for 4 people to share as a hearty appetizer.  My server / bartender seemed like a really cool, chill person, but unfortunately I didn't get great service. It took a while for everything - from water, to put in a beer order, to put in a food order....I had to really intently watch her walk around the bar in order to eventually make eye contact.   It seems like with better food and service, this could have been a 3 or 4-star experience, but I was left wanting more.",

    "text": "While I can appreciate VGK game nights have a bit more traffic than normal nights, I do have to question why management would not take this into account for staffing purposes. We (party of 6) were seated next to another table of VGK fans (4). Placed a simple order for 3 beers and 3 mixed drinks. Not certain if they had to go to St. Louis to retrieve the Budweiser but it felt that way. 16 minutes for 3 beers to arrive, all very lukewarm at best and another 3 minutes after that the mixed drinks arrived. As we drank, I could hear the angst of the table next to us who had been there for 20 minutes with no server yet approaching their table. They finally flagged down out waitress who graciously took their order. Gluttons for punishment, we ordered another round. Waitress clearly apologetic for another similar wait time. Took a pass on ordering any food as the thought crossed all our minds that we would miss puck drop. Best part-all this for close to $200.00 for two rounds of drinks.",

And to the wise: if you check in here, you get a free appetizer which could be fried pickles or the crispy brussels sprouts. They have quite a large selection of bottles and draft beer, and the food selection is outstanding considering there are about six or seven pages of sandwiches, flatbread, salads, etc. No matter what you were in the mood for, you'll definitely find something. The only reason I am not giving it five stars is because it is extremely pricey to eat here, which is to be expected since it is in the New York New York hotel and resort. A major bonus about this place is the outdoor seating which makes for great people watching on the strip!",

    "text": "I've gotten to visit for breakfast food and for Hapoy Hour. Here's what I've tried and how I think it rates!  CRISPY CHICKEN & CORNBREAD PANCAKE - A sweet cornbread pancake is topped with fried spicy boneless crispy chicken and salted caramel butter, served with a side of maple syrup. 5/5 The fried chicken is nicely seasoned and the pancake had great texture and flavor. This dish is probably my favorite!  HANGOVER SLOPPER* - Beef burger on a butter-toasted brioche bun, smothered with pork green chili, topped with queso fresco, pico de gallo, cheddar & jack, two fried eggs. 1.5/5 The bun was probably the worst part. The patty is nothing special and the pico is a little too spicy for my tastes.   CHILAQUILES A.K.A. BREAKFAST NACHOS - Tortilla chips simmered in tomatillo salsa, topped with two eggs any style, Asadero cheese, cilantro crema, queso fresco, pico de gallo. 4.5/5 How can you go wrong with chilaquiles?! Even though the pico is too spicy for me, I couldn't help but go back for more and more. I think the Cheese helped to put out the fire in my mouth...  URBAN POP TARTS - Apple Filled. 3/5 Nice filling, but not enough icing for my tastes.   BACON TWO WAYS SKILLET - Bacon and pork belly atop cheddar polenta grits plus pico de gallo and two freshly cooked eggs. 4/5 An obvious winner due to the amount of pick. Plus, the polenta was so flavorful and cheesy!!  GIGANTE BREAKFAST CUBANO - Carnitas, ham, hash browns, two fried eggs, Swiss cheese, yellow mustard, pickled onion and kosher dill, piled inside butter-toasted sourdough. 4/5 Another solid choice. Lots of meat and lots of flavor.   SALTED CARAMEL SKILLET FRENCH TOAST - Challah bread with topped with a caramel drizzle and salted caramel butter. 2/4 Skip this one as it's nothing special. The toast itself is just bleh. And there's barely enough caramel to take it anywhere.   Brussels Sprouts - 4/5 Free with check in! These are absolutely drenched in some kind of soy sauce. I happened to enjoy it.   French Fries two ways - 4/5 Half garlic fries and half sweet potato. The sweet potato didn't have a mouth seasoning for my tastes - definitely needed some salt and pepper. But the garlic fries were super solid!  Steak taco - 4/5 Hubby's favorite taco.   Adobo Taco - 4/5 My favorite Taco.",

Bear in mind, it's $25 for a drink at the top of the Waldorf (formerly Mandarin Oriental) in Las Vegas.  Drink sort of tasted as if ingredients were dumped one on top of the other. There's a training to mixing a cocktail in which all the flavors blend together which this was far from.   Bartender/waiter didn't really know what the specials were or anything, but otherwise the service was adequate.   Would recommend the Peppermill, less expensive and much much more fun.",

Sprouts had a nice flavor to them (on the sweet side) but in my opinion, should have been served in smaller chunks to give them an even crispier bite. For the entrees: we had the following:  1. Crispy chicken served with French Fries and grits. Chicken was delicious and perfectly crispy. The grits on the other hand was way too dry. My husband had a spoonful and left the rest untouched. 2. Seafood Mac and Cheese. Also very dry. Such a shame since I hardly order Mac and Cheese. I decided to treat myself and left disappointed. I ended picking the shrimp and lobster and like the grits, left the rest untouched.  I think this pretty much sums it up. With so many other restaurants to pick from, we ended in one where we left disappointed. As the saying goes: win some, lose some.",

I opted for an omelette that was perfectly done with mushrooms, avocado, tomatoes, and cheese. It came with grits/ polenta which was excellent. My friend went with the salted caramel French toast (omg) - phenomenal! I thought it would be too sweet but it was amazing.

Although Buxton was too hungover to drink, and he doesn't really eat any solid food, the others all had a meal.  Mr. Bloewen and I had a breakfast burrito each.  When they first came out, the first thought was, \"We both could have shared this!\"  However, it was so good, that we both ate it ourselves.  This is saying a lot, since Mr. Bloewen rarely finishes his food!  Mr. Booth made his own omelette and also seemed to enjoy it.  Best part of the meal was the $20 all you can drink mimosa's (until 2pm).  I still have no idea how we were able to drink so many of them after the prior 3 days of booze, but we did rally.  Big time...  Our server was fantastic, as we never had an empty glass.  She even gave us large \"to-go\" cups for a final mimosa that took me quite a while to finally put back.  I gladly will come here for breakfast next time I am in the area, and prefer this over the champagne brunch buffets.  If you check in on Yelp, they will give you an order of fried pickles or brussel sprouts.  Unfortunately, I don't like either.  But, since Boothie loves his pickles, Buxton insisted that we order a serving.  They were good, but nobody really ate them.  Recommended for a breakfast / brunch meal!",

The end result for those was just very average sliders. The crispy chicken and buffalo chicken sliders had mixed results. The chicken was a bit fatty for the crispy sliders, but the buffalo version was deemed good. Other dishes were the $5 hummus (decent) and the free order of brussels sprouts (Yelp check-in).  They also have all the baseball games available if you can find someone to change the station.    On a second visit, we had to walk out as the bartender was a straight-up cocky fool, refusing to change the TV station and asking us if we had been there before. That question should not be asked unless your at a place that is different or exciting, not just a normal restaurant where I look at a menu and order food and drinks.    Oh yeah at HH, watch out because the waitress asks what kind of fries you want with the sliders, but she doesn't tell you they cost about $5 extra. Luckily the manager took those fries off the bill.",

I got a double which in retrospect, was too expensive. But very very good.   Xiang Xiang duck wings for an appetizer. They were perfectly crispy with a spicy finish that was not too much.  Then it was on to the Lobster and Shrimp Mac N Cheese!!! WTF  This was the creamiest Mac N Cheese that I have ever had.  Ever!!!! Loved every moment of it. The shrimp was cooked to perfection as well. Skimpy in the lobster though.   Would definitely come back but please be mindful. There drinks are a bit pricey for Vegas eateries.",

As a plus - it was a cheaper option than other restaurants!   Things I loved and highly recommend:  + Their version of a Moscow Mule + FROG LEGS (...I'm so serious) + Sliders + Attentive Service + Fish tacos + Boneless pickled chicken tenders (easily shareable!)  Things that I could have passed up:  - Their Garlic and Parmesan fries. Try the tater tots instead maybe?  - Hummus Dip  These two options weren't bad necessarily but paled in comparison to the others.  Highly recommend!   Pro Tip: If the weather permits, definitely get a table outside and enjoy your food and drinks while Vegas people watching!   xo",

    "text": "FOOD POISONING  Get your attention? This horrible review follows up my NY, NY review I just finished. What a way to end my already horrible CES stay in Vegas.  I had a comp from MLIFE -- because I dropped $2k on the tables -- that I figured I should use before I leave. Tom Urban was the new spot at New York, New York so I thought, why not?  The comp was $49 dollars, which was plenty to have breakfast, even if I decided to get the most expensive thing on the menu.  I ordered the Filet Mignon and Eggs and a side of pancakes, because, why not? The filet mignon and eggs came out at a decent time, but not the pancakes. I went to cut into my steak only to realize I didn't have a steak knife. So after waiting 5-minutes my waitress to come back to check on me, and for me to ask for a damn knife, I picked away at the eggs and potatoes. They were just.. ok.  I finally get my knife and cut into the filet mignon medallions. They were bloody red, which wasn't what I ordered. I asked for medium and it was far too rare.  At this point I'm just annoyed, even if this wasn't my money paying for the meal. Now 20-minutes into my meal and the pancakes are still missing. You can tell the waitress forgot to put in that order with the way she was talking to the other help. When I finally receive the pancakes I noticed one is missing, but say nothing. I knew I wasn't going to be eating all of them, but wanted to at least taste them.  About 15-minutes after eating the pancakes and finishing up the rest of my meal a waiter comes over and says, \"I'm so sorry, you were suppose to have 3 pancakes, not 2. I'm going to bring another one over to you.\" In which I said, are you serious?  Now on to the fun part. The food poisoning. I'm going to go ahead and say it was the meat. The filet mignon was not good.. at all. I only took a few bites of it, and that's all I can think about making me sick.  To the management of Tom Urban: I know you're new and all, but that's no excuse for shit service and bad food.",

Cooked to perfect medium well burger-ness.  Sweet potato fries were crunchy on the outside, soft and gooey on the inside. Salted just enough to create an interesting flavor.  Ambiance: Great for happy hour or a fun, Friday night dinner.  Rather loud for a business meeting.  Service: Excellent.  Our waitress was kind and attentive.  Typical Vegas standard.

They came out wrong, had to be remade. They were not very good. Sounded good in theory but not good in reality. Especially with flies around. Yuck. Could not understand waitress, way too soft spoken. The prices are ok but any money spent on food not up to parr, is too much. Atmosphere is fun though and the location great.",

It was surprisingly delicious! My hubs is pretty picky when it comes to his food so I was glad he loved his burger!   His burger bun was like dinner rolls that are soft and he got garlic fries to go with that and they were delicious! Also the ketchup was a bit different in a good way. It had a bit of spiciness.   My Baja tacos were pretty great too! The service was pretty quick. Our waiter Oscar was awesome!",

    "text": "Dined here on a Saturday in the summer and got the best service from a server named Maggie. I have never said this in a review, but if you dine there, just ask to sit in her section. Seriously, some of the most attentive service I've gotten in a long time. I never had to ask for anything and she was just the sweetest gal.   Now onto the food. Here's what I got and my review on it: - Mac & Cheese with Lobster & Shrimp -  Super creamy cheesy (the kind that stretches from the plate to your mouth). It honestly was much better than I expected it to be. It didn't need any salt or pepper. It had just the right amount of seasoning and we ate the whole plate. We decided to get that as an appetizer. Hey, don't judge. We were heading to a concert later, so this was a late lunch/early dinner.   - Breakfast Figgy Piggy - Yum,  yum, and more yum! The bread was so buttery and delicious! And that fig jam is the perfect accompaniment to the salty cheese. I ordered it with a side of \"asadero hash browns.\" These were tasty too, but I was sandwich focused. It was just the right size - not too big...and did I mention buttery? Mmmm, so freakin' good!  If you're near the NYNY hotel or the Park MGM (which is where we were), definitely stop in and have a bite at Tom's Urban. Maggie, our server, told us they're open until 3am. This would be an awesome place to come for a late night snack!   I can't give this place high enough praises. Delicious food with great service that isn't too pricey - that's my kind of meal! And hey, Maggie - if you're reading this, you were AWESOME! Thank you SO much for taking care of us the way you did.",

If you feel like you are going to have more then two glass of mimosa and blood mary then their unlimited package is not a bad deal. I only had one glass so I just got the regular priced one.  Food: I ordered lemon Pancakes with the syrup on the side which is soo good, beware the pancakes in my opinion is sweet so really didn't need the syrup.  I also ordered Veggie spirit I substitute some things with a side of hash brown and side of grits. The grits were my favorite was really good, very creamy and I am sure very unhealthy but it was soo delicious.  The service was not to bad, I mean it was great I had to wave him down a few times for him to refill our waters.  But overall I like this place for breakfast I have not gone for lunch or dinner so not sure how the food is. But this my favorite place for breakfast/brunch. It is on the pricey side but in my opinion its huge portions that you can share.",

Our waitress took our drink orders and came back, one water short, left and didn't come back for about 20 minutes. Finally able to request shorted water and order our food. Probably another 15 minutes before she checked on us again and able to request refills and straws. Shorted one glass of water refill and never brought straws. Had to grab pitcher and fill ourselves. Had to request from manager passing by napkins and utensils. About another 20 minutes food finally came, short 2 meals, which apparently were never ordered, every meal we did get (some ordered breakfast and some lunch) were all cold!  On top of all meals being cold, the hash browns weren't cooked through, cheese on hamburgers not melted, and eggs on the benedict were overcooked to hard boiled. Manager was sent over and at first trying to fix things, but would take another half an hour to fix all new meals. He was clearly annoyed with us and said we didn't have to pay. But not worth the hour out of my vacation, the additional time it took to go somewhere else and get food or the other couple of hours it took to finally stop being upset. Apparently the reviews aren't read by the hotel or restaurant because the responses to the negative reviews are thanking them and happy they enjoyed the meal when they clearly did not. Do yourself a favor and skip this place!!!",

    "text": "Tom's Urban may just work in a pinch.   Being located on the Las Vegas Strip cannot be easy. Tom's Urban is within a football throw of Shake Shack, Eataly, Bruxie, and countless others in every price and genre spectrum you could dream up. This makes it tough to compete when there is a cult status $10.00 fast food Burger located literally next door and you are schlepping a $26.00 Double Burger in a sports bar sit-down format. Dollar for dollar Tom's Urban just can't compete even with a superior Angus pair of patties.   Or you could go to L'Altier, Best Freind, or In N Out.   Tom's Urban is a familiar set up that reminds one of Stack'd or Eureka! here in Orange County. The service is solid, the atmosphere is upscale while still being entertaining, and the Bar is gigantic as well as the focal point. There is nothing to hate on Tom's Urban for and had this location been in a random suburb I bet this would be a 4-star review but it isn't -it is in the middle of all the action on The Strip.  I stopped in very late on a Saturday night with a large party and we took over a couple of table facing Las Vegas Boulevard and we ordered several Craft Beers along with the Sriracha Buffalo Wings to help soak up some of the debaucheries from the past 5 hours. At $14.99, I figured the price was reasonable enough considering the locale. That said, I would have fancied a bit more generous portions.  These Wings feature a - you guessed it - Sriracha Buffalo Sauce, along with Celery & Carrots and you can choose either a traditional Blue Cheese or Green Chili Ranch for dipping. The sauce was an amalgamation of Sriracha and what seemed like a heavy-handed fist worth of butter that was simply used to toss the Chicken Wings in. Not exactly culinary genius but it lived up to the advertising at a bare minimum. The Celery & Carrots were Celery & Carrots as was the Bleu Cheese Dressing.   So there you have it - the mother of all 3-Star review for Tom's Urban. Sorry, no pictures. That was mandate made early on in the evening.",

    "text": "Had a great experience dining here with my large family on a recent Tuesday evening. Reservations helped and this location accommodated our party of 19 comfortably.  Our group was pleasantly served by Eddie and Ashley. They were friendly and attentive. With so many items on the menu, they gave us some good suggestions on what are the popular items as well as their favorites.  Food overall was good. I ordered the pork belly bahn mi tacos. A quarter inch sliced cut pork belly with Asian slaw, cilantro chile mayo, sliced jalapeno and pickled onions on the side. Had a good combination of flavors and touch of kick. Enjoyed it with a glass of the whiskey business.  The rest of my family seemed to have enjoyed what they ordered and although the desserts all sounded good on the menu, we were too full to try em.   Note: Free fried dill pickles when you check in on yelp!",

I also ended up ordering nachos and was surprised by how good they tasted, but it could have also been the beer that made them taste delicious. The waitress was very nice and prompt and always kept our glasses filled with water.  I sat outside in the patio and really enjoyed the experience. Since it was later in the evening, the weather wasn't too hot and the music was great.",

We like the dynamic menu and convenience of the location. Our server was nice, however the food came in unsatisfactory. Presentation was awful, my our orders came in different times and we had to wait for missing side dishes. It was frustrating, the person delivering our food was giving us someone else's order and looked confused. I have never experienced this before in this location. I will NOT come back again, since it is a little pricey I expected better food, great service and prompt attention. Our receipt had this info 8/27 Check#15133276 table 375, making that we were an actual customer that dined in today. If could ask for a refund I would, but I can barely get server to assist us and just wanted to leave.I would not recommend it.",

No one has taken our drink order, said \"hi I'll be right there\" nothing.... The people next to us got their food, changed their minds, asked for it to go, got boxes for everything, got their check, paid and left and still we sat there... Feeling kinda dumb at this point.  It has now been almost 10 to 13 minutes with no service what so ever!  So I asked my girl if she wanted to go and she what I was thinking \"yeah let's go. They don't seem to care that we are here.\"  So we got up and left. No one said a word. So FAIL today Toms . So we ended up at New York pizzeria.",

The waitress Megan was so fun and sweet.  We loved this place so much we went back for dinner and had the BLT Lobster roll with garlic fries! That sandwich was filled with lots of lobster and it tasted so fresh! We loved it. I could have used a little more mayo on it but it also came with a spicy ketchup that was amazing. The fries were crisp, thin and not overly topped with garlic. Our server Eddie was so great and recommended we try the fried chicken next time. I highly recommend you give this place a try!",

Last time I had a grease burger that bad was at Hardee's.  Awful.  Too lazy to put condiments on the tables? I don't remember ever having to ask to \" not\" put ketchup & mustard on a sandwich. Typically you add those to your taste.  One star only for our service, apparently Joanna couldn't see that three fourths of my grease burger was uneaten, the second time!  Zero stars to management and the coo coos in the kitchen.",

We were there during happy hour and sat on the patio. There were a few other tables filled but it was not busy. The happy hour menu was meh so I had the Benedict with hash browns. It's nice to be able to order breakfast for dinner! The meal was good but not quite hot enough. The sauce could've been tastier too.  We enjoyed the videos which were pretty much right above us at our nice corner table. Some bevvies are $5 during happy hour, but I chose the Tom's Big One (beer option) a 33 ouncer of Lienenkugel Oktoberfest. At $15, the Big One is a nice option to have, and a semi bargain as well. I noticed the menu showed Tom's giant martini glass photo op inside the casino and offered a free printed photo via social media. Our server didn't know about it and asked a manager who told her the printer wasn't working. Boo!",

    "text": "What a horrible experience! I came here with friends on a Saturday afternoon shortly after landing in Las Vegas. I came specifically because my co workers told me how great the Patron Milkshakes are and that the food was tasty!   Well first blow to my experience was that they were out of Patron milkshakes! Can someone explain to me how a restaurant that is located on the strip of Las Vegas on a Saturday afternoon is out of anything?!! I was livid. They told me that they were out of the milkshake mix but not the Patron. Sounds like bad managing of inventory if you ask me.   Secondly the customer service was horrible. They did not offer a replacement drink for my troubles and our waitress was switched out without warning and the first waitress gave us the wrong information. She allowed my friends to order $19 bottomless mimosas and then after serving the mimosas told them that the deal would end in about 10 minutes!! Wth!! Basically meaning that in 10 minutes they had to drink as many as they could. That's horrible.   The waitress ended up taking it off of the bill but here is where it gets worse.   The mimosas were watered down like they had been pre-made and were sitting in a pitcher of ice all day. They must do better than that. The food was disgusting. The English muffin on my eggs Benedict was stale and hard. The hollandaise sauce lacked flavor and my food was cold. I'm just so fed up with place. Do yourself a favor and don't waste your time. Maybe try Shake Shack next door. Come to think of it. I should've just gone next door ordered a shake from shake shack and told them to put Patron in it. But I was so pissed off and in complete disbelief at the service and experience I couldn't think logically. This place has got to get it together.",

The staff were attentive and took care of everything, even when an order didn't come out right they took care of it right away. Great addition to the strip.",

They have a lot of seating inside as well as some outdoor seating as well. Vegas doesn't have ideal weather much of the year so if they have it, take advantage of it!  I have been to the one in LA and the hometown location of Las Vegas. They both offer the same food and at roughly the same price. During my time here, I ordered a Hangover Slopper which sounded the most appealing with the burger, eggs, fries, and additional deliciousness that followed suit. I also ordered some beers, in which they have a pretty good selection for you to choose from. Our service was good with the occasional person checking up on us to see how our food was and if there was anything else that we needed throughout the night. It can be a bit pricy, so I wouldn't recommend coming here too often, but definitely a nice place you can enjoy one in a while.",

The wings and pot stickers were really good, the salad came with a Tuscan dressing that was super tasty, and the pineapple upside down cake was amazing!!!  It was the best I ever tasted!!!  Drink prices are reasonable.  They also sell regular or spiked milkshakes.    You can access the restaurant directly from the strip or from inside New York New York.  It also has indoor and outdoor seating.  Tom's Urban really delivered especially considering it has only been open for few days.  Definitely check it out!",

Everything was downhill from the moment we sat down. Waitress took our order and repeated it a couple of times...  the place was empty and they seemed fully staffed so i dont know why it took 25 min to get our food. there was 5 of us and only 4 orders came out...apparently one of the orders had been burnt and they had to start all over again... Only 1 of the 5 orders came out correctly  Someone had specifically said no bacon in their burger...the burger had bacon in it Someone ordered sprite and the waitress brought out Sierra mist Someone ordered a double cheeseburger medium well and one of the patties was medium well the other one was rare which means they cooked them separately.  Anyway we were a bit annoyed so we called someone over and asked to see the manager.  Mr. Hancock came by and calmly we explained our situation to him and kept cutting us off and making excuses for all the mistakes then he proceeded to say \"well what can i do to make you NOT be hostile right now...because youre being hostile\" Which was a big NO-NO because nobody was being hostile.  Anyways long story short i think Mr. Hancock realized he approached the situation all wrong and quickly changed his attitude and took a different approach in fixing the situation instead of making excuses for everything. He comped our meal which was nice and brought out some deserts on the house. He made sure to come back to our table several times to double check everything was ok and if we needed anything else.  Furthermore,  Im not sure where the miscommunication was and how almost all our orders came out wrong, however we did appreciate the manager, Hancock salvaging our lunch and turning the situation around for us so that we were able to enjoy our last meal in Vegas.",

Lots of toppings and the dog was thick and juicy, no homo. Fries were good too, thin style, a tad undercooked, but didn't stop me from eating them. Had a few beers, selection was pretty decent.

The food could be better, and I am sure that it will improve.  We had the truffled mushroom flatbread (if I can remember correctly).  It was tasty, although a bit oily.  Not to the point of being inedible, but more than to my liking.  I gave feedback to our waiter simply because if I was opening a restaurant, I would want to know as well.  Overall taste was pretty good though.    The patio here is superb for people watching!    In a nutshell, I am always understanding when a restaurant first opens.  I would try this place again.",

Despite a packed restaurant, Michele made sure we wanted for nothing.  She was also kind enough to give us tips on places we should visit according to our likes.  we loved everything she suggested.  I ordered the chicken taco dish.  You get three tacos full of meat.  The food needed a little extra seasoning, but tasted great after a small dash of salt.  While the food was pretty good, I truly gave Tom's four stars because the service was impeccable.  What I appreciated second to the great service was the fact the food came out extremely fast.  Be sure to ask how each dish is prepared, as the dishes don't come out the way you would expect them to look.  For example, the Prime Rib Philly Cheesesteak Dip has very, very thick slices of medium rare beef, and the Boulder Colorado Club is served open-faced in an oblong baking dish - it looks more like a bowl of lasagna.  With all the options in Las Vegas, Tom's Urban is worth a try.",

We were starving, but we wanted to eat something light for the day clubs in Vegas, so this place was the perfect place. They had some great selections of salads that were HUGE. It filled us up and was so flavorful. I got the cob salad. It was filled with great ingredients. It had cabbage, blue cheese, bacon bits, avocado, corn and so much more. It didn't even need a lot of the salad dressing because it was so flavorful.  My sister got a salmon salad and this was soooo good. It was on a bed of cabbage and the dressing was slightly spicy.  The server was very friendly and made sure she took care of us.  They had a really delicious breakfast menu too. I wanted to come for breakfast, but never found the time to come back. I wanted to try their breakfast pop tarts.  A very good option if you're starving in Vegas. It is pretty pricey though, but I feel like everything on the strip is around that price. So you should come check it out!",

We then were seated to eat and when we asked the waiter about some brunch items he said he didn't eat meat and wouldn't eat any of this crap.

When I arrived to check in however, the girl at the front said they don't do bar reservations that it was all open seating.  Okay, so why did the other girl tell me it was fine to reserve the seats - even asked if there was a certain game on that I wanted to be put on the tv. (It was Sunday and we were there for football)    Speaking of asking what I want to watch on tv - we were snapped at when we asked to change the tvs to a different game and were told that managers pre set everything and they couldn't be switched.     The service was awful.  Everyone in that place looked like they had just rolled out of bed.  Maybe that's why they moved so incredibly slow ? My bartender, who never mentioned her name, was less than inviting.  Maybe the service industry just isn't for her ?  She seemed very overwhelmed with the three tickets in her well.   My bacon bloody was far from hand crafted.   It was poured straight from a container.  Whenever we wanted a Refill on our bottomless mimosas - that are served in a stemless wine glass - we were forced to ask.  And then wait.  I feel like all we did was wait.  20 minutes just to take our order is crazy.  Learn to multitask.  Food was alright at best.   We left at halftime.   The only reason we even stayed that long was to watch the game.",

I have no complaints about the omelet it was great, but the potatoes were covered in cheese.  While most people wouldn't complain, I couldn't handle that so early.

The place wasn't busy. 10 minutes later no one came to our table. No biggie. We got up and moved to the bar area (back part). Bar tender was on the other side of the bar so he couldn't see us. We called a staff walking by and asked for the menu. Another 10 minutes passed by and we saw the the staff we asked organizing the tables and utensil on the other side of the room. What the heck? She forgot about us! There were also lot of staff walking around and cleaning and no one bothered to come to us. Hhhhmmm. So upset that we just left.   When we got outside, a man who appeared to be a manager greeted us \"thank you for coming\" and I said, \"We didn't even get service\". He immediately apologized and asked us to come back and we refused. We appreciate the apology, but not coming back again.

They don't have particularly vegan/gluten-free options, but I was able to price together a good lunch with a side salad, Brussels sprouts, and hummus. They subbed the flatbread for tortilla chips for me as well. They were flexible with the menu, which was nice. Atmosphere is nice with some relevant music going. The beer and cocktails menu is huge, and they offered coconut water cocktails. Overall I found it to be pretty good for my family's diverse needs (mine gluten-free/vegan, my husband's carnivore tendencies, and my son's desires for pancakes all day).",

I ordered the *Gigante Breakfast Cuban* which has carnitas, ham, hash browns, fried eggs, swiss cheese, yellow mustard, pickled onion, inside of the butter-toasted sourdough and I got the shoestring garlic fries. Filling and amazing breakfast sandwich as the name says it all.. so yummy!! I also opted for the unlimited mimosas at an extra charge.

I really hope they had a talk with the bartender about her customer service skills and that nobody ever has to go through what I did.  With that being said, upon our return to Las Vegas last week, we paid Tom's Urban another visit suggested by upper management to give them another chance,  & boy oh  boy, what a change and a great change at that. Redemption is a good word to use. We were greeted by the hostess, met with management; might I add they apologized for last time and was served with excellence. They surely  righted a wrong and showed us what real customer service is. Our waitress Amberly (spelling) was on point, checked on us frequently, and made sure the libations and the H20 was flowing.  Excellent come back! Two yums up it is!",

Our drinks were good, but expensive. $24.50 for a Bloody Mary...Vegas prices!?!  Whatever.  The bottomless mimosas were just as expected.  The best part was the to-go cups with a fresh mimosa.   The food.... well, I ordered the Huevos Benedictito, a Spanish version of eggs Benedict.  Great in concept, but not execution.  The English muffin was tough and burnt, the carnitas was hard (how do you get meat hard & dry...too much time under the warming lamp perhaps), but the eggs and sauce were tasty.  At least there was something redeeming about the plate.  And don't even think about getting the hash browns unless you want some undercooked and not seasoned potato strings.  (I think they were potatoes?) They were bland and blended into the plate. My hubby ordered the Beach Bum omelette which looked good and full of veggies. He said it was okay, but he had the same lifeless pile of cardboard shoestring things they called hash browns.   Lastly, the table had no condiments.  No salt & pepper, no sugar, NOTHING. It's the little things that make up the big picture.  I hope it was just an off day, but I don't think I will take a gamble with giving Tom's Urban another chance. Sorry...",

The wait took a while to greet us and take drink orders. We started to look up other places to eat just when our waiter walked up. Once he came around he was on it taking our orders and serving. We had fish tacos, shrimp salad, honey bbq chicken sliders, & baby back ribs. The food was good, nothing extraordinary.",

I swear I wasn't drunk yet haha.  I had the peach Cosmo which was (super expensive) really really good!!! My experience with cosmopolitans isn't a good one but I tried  the Peach Martini here and it was delicious!!! *pic included   With the yelp app we got brussel sprouts for free with our drink. And boy oh boy were they good!!! So make sure you check in!!!  I took off a star because our interaction with the first server wasn't the best my cousin was highly disappointed. She wasnt much help in info on what was offered. So once Victoria came over it was a breath of fresh air and or experience enhanced 10 fold!  Basically if you're looking for a good drink and a free app stop here along your way down the strip.",

And being tired and hungry, we weren't too picky for a dinner choice.  Unlike other sports bars, Tom's Urban actually never get's to the point of being too loud for conversation. At least while we were there. And for the very first time, my wife followed my lead in the use of the free Yelp check-in items offered here. So we ended up with 2 free Brussels Sprouts appetizers to share between the 3 of us. Our youngest son joining us on this trip. And some amazing Brussels Sprouts they were! Everyone enjoyed them, and that's saying a lot for my wife and son who normally don't care for them. I've been a fan my entire life.  For our entrees, my wife went with the Baby Kale Grilled Chicken Salad. My son the 3 Steak \"Al Carbon\" Tacos. And for myself, the Crispy Chicken & Cornbread Pancake; which our helpful server stated was her favorite. We were all pleased with our choices, with my wife's only complaint being that the grilled chicken was a bit dry. My dish was amazing and I'd definitely consider ordering it again.   Tom's Urban, a very good choice for a casual dinner.",

What a great, chill atmosphere. Some of our party were in and out gambling and beginning day 1 while we feasted on steak and omelettes, breakfast toasters and the like.  PAMELA: and by Pamela, I mean our AMAZING waiter and host who was respectful, fun and efficient. Drinks were constantly refilled and made and everything else was above and beyond!

The appetizers were quite good as we passed around trays of duck wings, nachos and potstickers. Their famous fried chicken was just their version of chicken tenders.

However the bellhops at New York New York didn't recommend him and said they were too high, I'm glad I didn't listen to them. We had excellent service with even better Mamosa's. The prices are typical Las Vegas Strip cost, but you do get a large portions for what you pay. We definitely left a table full & didn't feel cheated at all.",

Look at it as a bar with an occasional aroma of passing food. Nice people but I would recommend passing unless you have a lot of time to kill. Besides this, be prepared to deal with pigeons flying past you and going for your food. My picture shows what can happen as soon as you walk away for a second. My tacos were good but for $17, I'd pass if I were you.",

For the overall price of the meal, and the quality of the food. This is a good place to eat. Would like to try more options on the menu. Felt like a bargain compared to most places.   We both got the steak tenders med rare. Mine was med while the other was med rare. It tastes good with out the sauce. The sauce was like a spicy Italian. A bit of a kick of spice in the med-hot range.  Very good with or with out the sauce. Garlic fries were nicely cooked. Ketchup had a nice flavor to it also. Couldn't tell what the additive was. Service was very good.    We were pleasantly surprised. Must try!",

It's a casual, chill atmosphere to hang out with friends and drink.  The bad: everything else.  Firstly, the food is okay; good wasn't worth the price. I ordered take out and got the Barbecue Bacon Jalapeno burger, but instead I got Bacon Avocado burger. While not what I wanted, it was good enough so I ate but I looked over the receipt and I was charged the jalapeno burger. The two are priced about the same but I just found it weird that the order is correctly put in but it was still the wrong food. Second, I wanted to sit at the bar while i wait for my food, but the server, Rachel, was very suspicious of me. Showed my ID and everything but she was very wary of me, very suspicious looking, making comments like if I can pay for my food because it \"doesn't look like I'm old enough to work,\" joking that i can have some water since i don't look like i can order anything from the bar. So I am not surprised that the order was incorrect because obviously i wasn't taken seriously enough.",

The pizza was 8 slices so I didn't even make a dent in it but I was able to take the leftovers with me for later.  The pigeons do come around as soon as someone leaves their table.

I came back the next day for breakfast because it's pretty hard to mess up breakfast.  Well my omelette took 40mins to make it to my table and it had a definite crunch to it.  If you want fruit instead of hash browns too bad they charge you extra for fruit.  For some reason the fruit was cut into itty-bitty pieces making it a bit tricky to eat.",

    "text": "My girlfriends and I decided to meet up at Toms Urban the other night after work for some cocktails and laughs. We met at the bar and decided just to stay and order food instead of sitting at a table. I have to say that the best part of our night was the service we received from our bartender, Juan. JUAN is the BOMB! He went above and beyond to make sure that all of our needs were met. He was on top of everything from all the signature cocktails we ordered to the numerous small plates we devoured. He was so attentive and seemed to genuinely care about experience there. He is also very easy on the eyes!! I love that the bartenders were wearing bowties and suspenders! All of the cocktails and small plates were delicious! We all agreed to make Tom's Urban our new hangout!",

Being a creature of habit, I was a bit skeptical to try a new place. Tom's Urban really out-did themselves and have now become my new favorite place to dine on the strip.  The atmosphere was great, and the staff were very friendly. I ordered the filet mignon sliders with sweet potato fries.  Oh my, were these delicious!!  My boyfriend ordered the carnitas tacos, which of course I had to have a bite.  The menu has a blend of items to satisfy the most picky eater.  We sat inside, as it was pretty cold outside, but they have an outdoor bar and patio area that will be prove to be prime people watching during my trip back to Vegas this summer.   We loved it so much, we're going to the one in LA Live tonight!",

We ordered coffee and when they brought it to us we were told they had no cream. I asked for a small shot of baileys in lieu of cream and was ultimately charged $10.50 for the shot. We had to ask for silverware, water and butter for the toast. Bloody Mary's were $13.50 each, we both ordered sausage but one of us got bacon. We had to flag down our waitress for hot sauce, salt and pepper. Overall the meal was very bland, both of us had 2 eggs. Hash browns, toast and 1 Bloody Mary each and the bill was over $80. Avoid this place. Try Americas at NY NY.",

The first day, they gave us four 22 oz beers for free instead of giving us four 33 oz beers and making us pay for two. The second day, they told us that they weren't sure how the coupons worked, but that they would figure it out and make it work. Then, halfway through drinking our beers, they said the coupons don't work, but that they would give us one beer for free. Really, we only had to pay for one extra beer, but it was frustrating that they told us that we could use it and then told us we couldn't after we had already ordered. Service was also very slow, despite that only a quarter of the bar was full. They also had to comp an entire table near us because of bad service.",

He asked our waitress (Geri) several questions and she checked with the kitchen on several occasions to see how they could accommodate my dads requests. I was impressed that she didn't seem irritated at all (I work in F&B and would have been so pissy with my dad at this point). She was very helpful, patient and attentive. I normally wouldn't have written a review if this were a normal dining experience with delicious food. Geri was great and what made our night exceptional. THank you for all of your help! Dad says that when he is off of this diet this will probably become a regular spot based on the great service, location and great menu selection. I promise he won't be such a pain next time",

You could tell he was excited about not only his job but the food, which is awesome to see. We had a few of the mixed drinks on the menus, some local craft beers, and for dinner the pepperoni pizza & burger with fried egg/onion strip on it. Both meals were amazing and fulfilling, burger cooked well and very juicy. Even though we didn't try any of the other eclectic items on the menu, we left very satisfied and had fun!",

I ordered the shrimp and grits which was great.  Just wish they put more crispy pork belly in it. Also tasted some of the carne asada from my wife's nachos and it was really good.",

All of the scrambled dishes were almost inedible, I suspect they use freeze dried eggs or something based on how terrible it was.  The Benedict was cooked correctly and while it wasn't awesome it was up to par.  Second problem was the service which was totally inattentive, I couldn't get catsup in less than 15 minutes.  The last problem was they upsold us on bottomless mimosas but left out the part about them costing almost 20 bucks each!  We left with a bill for breakfast well over $100 with bad service and terrible food.",

    "text": "Although I said I would never go back, my wife loves the duck wings here so we decided to give it another go. The place was relatively empty for a Friday evening so I was a little worried that there was a problem. We sat at the main bar and were immediately greeted by Danni who was very friendly, upbeat and professional.  Bar service was excellent.  Dani got our drinks right away and checked back with us regularly to see if we were ready for another round or needed anything else. We ended up ordering some appetizers (duck wings and sliders).  The one thing that has not changed about this pace is the inordinate amount of time it takes to get food from the kitchen to the table. I didn't time it but the place was 75% empty and it must have taken 20-30 minutes to get two appetizers.  When the food finally did arrive it was hot and fresh and very good so no problems with quality.  I ended up telling Dani about the last review I did and told her how much we appreciated the professional service we were receiving from her.  Dani let us know that she was the bar manager, which we were both glad to hear since that will hopefully influence the overall performance of the staff at the bar.  There was another bartender on that night (Stephanie?) who was also very friendly and professional so it looks like Dani is managing her team well.  Dani also bought us a round of drinks which was a very classy thing to do. It was definitely a better experience this time than we had in January but if it were not for Dani I would on the fence because of the slooow food service. At this point, I'd say it was overall a good experience.",

Our last morning before we headed back to LA we had breakfast. We both ordered the same thing. Eggs, bacon, hash browns and toast. Good size portions and fresh. The highlight of the breakfast though had to be the hash browns. The only way to describe them is if you take mash potatoes added cheese rolled them up into a ball, smashed them flat and then fried them. Soooo delicious! Ended the meal with a coffee and a mimosa and called it a morning. Great new spot on the strip I'll definitely will visit again.",

We walked in because the outdoor dining area was right on the strip and looked like a great place to have lunch, and then we asked to sit inside, go figure. Our hostess Amariah was very friendly and suggested a few items that we tried. We were not dissapointed. The shrimp and grits was first and it was a wonderful dish. It was a tasting plate big enough for two people. For entrees we had the colorado hot brown and the street taco plate. Both were large, although pricey dishes. They were excellent and everything was cooked perfectly. I was planning on ordering one of the many different milkshakes but was too full after my meal, i guess i have a reason to go back now. Great lunch. Would be 5 stars if it wasnt so pricey.",

Once we finally ordered she topped off my water but not my wife's, which left her with out anything to drink for a while cause she then stopped coming for 5 minutes (bitter sweet break). As far as the food goes .... Super expensive bar food ... 75 bucks for two burgers , fries , fried calamari and one beer...

The portions are reasonable to generous, the prices are also reasonable for casual dining and cheap for Vegas. Once the food got to us, I forgave the questionable start.    The food is fabulous!  I had the \"Sticky\" Belly Steamed Buns appetizer and the Sadler's Texas Pulled Pork BBQ.  Both were well seasoned and delicious!  The entree came with shoestring garlic fries which were skinny, crisp and garlicky and accompanied by a distinct homemade ketchup.  My friend had sweet potato fries and that was accompanied by a different ketchup. Each side is paired with its own variation of homemade ketchup.   The pulled pork was cooked perfectly with just right amount of BBQ sauce so that's the tasty but the bread doesn't get mushy. I had half the next day and it was still delicious and not mushy.

What I'm not crazy about is the food. It's average at best. Sticky belly buns ($9) suffered from hard buns, overassessed pork belly and a slaw drowning in liquid reminiscent of a dirty mop soaking in a bucket. They don't have a kids menu but offered kid-sized portions of their cheese pizza (which was overcooked) and chocolate shake. On the brighter side, the ginger chicken potstickers ($8) showcased a nice sear and ample filling, while the bacon avocado burger's ($17) chargrilled, well seasoned patty between toasted brioche reminded me why I'm a fan of Smashburger (also created by restaurateur Tom Ryan). It's a simple, well executed, juicy and greasy burger that satisfies that craving. Washing it down with their Kraken spiced rum salted caramel shake ($13.50) was the perfect way to say F-you to my sometimes healthy eating habits. It was a touch heavy on alcohol (that's not really a complaint) and I was surprised to hear that waitresses are responsible for creating the shakes, not the kitchen or bar staff.  With a location right on the Strip in the boulevard/district area off of NYNY leading to the under construction arena, they'll probably stay busy. Unfortunately, it won't be because the food is a hit.",

I had some sort of burrito with a Thai themed food, our friend had calamari and my husband had bbq chicken sliders. We had a senior waiter who was very rushed and a new trainee. The food was ok and staff were nice, but just as in Malibu, you are in a fun spot for the view, it is crowded, and the food is all right. Being locals our expectations are extremely high for there are so many off-Strip gems and world class chefs to please our palates. We would come back if we had newcomers because the staff really make the place: problem is they seem pretty overworked.",

When the cooks messed up once she totally fixed it and took it off the bill. She even gave one of us free fries, too, for waiting. Oh, and the food was also delicious.

The table areas were not nearly as clean, as I had hoped. They have numerous TVs, to watch sports, but don't ask them to change a specific TV to a specific sporting event. They won't oblige. It is Vegas, so expect a higher cost for average food. There are numerous other choices, along the strip. Unless you can't walk any further or are absolutely starving, then go ahead try it out.

After ordering and receiving our food/drinks, no one else came by to check on us or refilled our water. When we asked for the bill, it took about 10 minutes for them to bring it. Then, we asked for the tea to-go and that took them another 5 minutes. It honestly doesn't take that long to get a check and a drink.   Food:  Despite the service, the food was amazing. They have vegetarian and vegan options which is a huge plus for my family. The food was cooked to perfection and the portions was a decent size. One of my family member got the Eggs Benedict and I got the homemade pop tart. My family said the eggs were delicious and were cooked perfectly. My pop tart was utterly sweet, but delicious. For all the sweet tooth people out there, this is a must try.",

The space is bright and airy. It includes bar seating, restaurant style seating, and al fresco, with some pretty cool misters for the Vegas heat. One thing I like about Tom's Urban is that the serving staff are considerate and don't mind speaking up about what their favorite dishes are in the restaurant. I've had brunch and dinner here, and both times my food was yummy. I like that Tom's takes a different/eclectic/fun approach to food. They aren't intimidated by new flavor combinations, which is so refreshing. I believe Tom's has more beers on tap than I have ever seen in my entire life in one place. Additionally, they have a well-stocked well. Seriously, look up and all around at the many variations of alcohol they have. They even have a pretty amazing happy hour. I can't say enough good things about Tom's Urban. A side note: take a selfie with the big martini glass on the other side of the casino, post it to social media, and get a discount. It's a win-win unless you're embarrassing yourself in the selfie (remember social media selfies don't stay in Vegas). Seriously, though, try Tom's Urban if you're interested in something off the beaten path with good flavor, good service, and good ambiance.",

I had the chop salad, super shareable for two, the hummus was delicious and super fresh as well, and the dumplings with hoisin sauce to compliment.   I would say only downfall is he bathroom area. Restaurant is so nice but the bathroom needs a revamp. It's not a deal breaker.   They had so many areas to sit at and three bars for drinks to consume. I will definitely be back for my next visit. Great job and hope people appreciate good service and great food. Toms Urban has me sold, I will definitely check out the LA location when I get back home. Hopefully it's just as great.",

Both times we were there it wasn't busy, but it took awhile for someone to come over to take our orders, to receive our food, and to get the check.  I had to flag someone down to come to our table, and the dining experience was more drawn out than it should be.",

    "text": "Upon entering from the LV Blvd side, the patio looked nice and relaxing as they were all filled up.  We walked up, were greeted by the hostess and seated right away.  Checking out the bars, monitors, modern tables, and the overall roominess of the place made for a great layout.    Our server was April, and she did an excellent job!  Presented the menus, made a few good suggestions, and followed up with us as we grubbed on our order.  Here's the goods we had: ~ Colorado Hot Brown: ($21) Slices of turkey and ham sitting on top of a piece of sourdough bread, but imagine it smothered with a pork green chili sauce and tomato.  This is no sandwich mind you!  And finally to add on top, sprinkles of melted pepper jack and cheddar cheese, and applewood-smoked bacon.  Served with you choice of shoestring garlic fries or sweet potato fries.  I chose the yummy crispy garlic shoestring fries.  As for the Hot Brown itself, it wasn't bad at all.  A tad salty.  There was also bit of heat with the nice chili sauce, but overall a great combo of meat.  Almost stew-like.  ~ Truffled Maine Lobster Roll: ($22) Maine lobster with a truffled mayo on a butter-toasted brioche roll.  Not bad not bad!  I gotta say it was nice and lobster meaty.  In comparison, I also tried a lobster roll from Phillip's Seafood at Ceasar's.  Now the textures were quite similar, but Tom's roll just beat them out.  It's gotta be the truffle flavor!  If you can't decide, choose this.  Now, I can't say that I totally fell in love with the place, but I can't say I hated it either.  With only an average taste, the prices sorta speak for themselves when browsing through the menu.  IMO, this was a straight 3.5 star experience simply because of the good clean atmosphere and great service, but I'm being generous by rounding up.   ~ Would I be back to try something different?  Yes.   ~ Is it worth a try?  Check the menu, and if price isn't your issue, then Yes.  There's a lot of good looking items on that menu.",

The first time I had a bunch of snacks as my meal: roasted edamame w jalapenos, kale salad side, chicken potstickers and cheesy polenta side. I was happy my eclectic choices.   What's extra great was that they had a sparkling wine that was delicious and only $7 a glass with a nice pour.   This place was extremely comfortable temperature-wise because they have shaded outdoor seating with nearby misters to keep you cool and indoor seating if you opt to go inside. I found a little spot at the end of the bar where it's a perfect balance of not too cool from inside air conditioning yet not too hot from being fully outside. And lots of activity for people watching! As well as TVs if there's a sport you needed to catch.   Both bartenders that's served me had great personalities. I'm a fan!",

Was there for a conference and on our longest day we had a two hour gap for lunch and were sick of the options and lines in the three main connected hotels that most conference attendees were staying in (that may or may not have been right across an outdoor walkway). We stepped up to Tom's on a whim and after a quick glance at the menu, we decided why not. Went with a group of 4, informed them we were in a bit of a hurry and they assured us their kitchen would be able to whip up the food quickly (and they did!).   Three of the four of us wound up with brunch, and one went with a lunch sandwich and we were all really pleased with our food. I got a build your own omelet, with the sourdough toast and the asiago hashbrown (which I highly recommend!). The food was cooked perfectly, exactly as I specified, and was hot and fresh. The serving was very large, definitely worth every penny of the cost. I got a latte, was better than your average diner coffee, but I could take it or leave it. The waitress we had was a sweetheart, and she split our bill without an issue. The restaurant was clean and True to their word, we were in and out with time to spare. Probably one of the better options at New York New York.",

Beer was cold and refreshing however our server had a major attitude. Didn't like the fried pickles so they were a let down as I love pickles. When we got the bill the waiter thought he was being slick and trying to pull one over on us when we had a coupon 2 for 1 beers. We have used this before and always received a credit for $21 on our bill. He told me this did not apply to happy hour but the price on the bill reflected the happy hour prices so his logic was very flawed. I was getting upset bc he was arguing with me over something I have used before no issues along with several others who had the same credit given to them no matter the time. Also this was my actual birthday and he was treating me poorly. I regret coming here to celebrate and should have gone elsewhere to be treated properly for my birthday. Staff is rude and they ignore you even when nearly empty. They also seem to makeup their own rules and there is not a blanket rule for how things should be handled which is fishy at best. Felt like he was scamming us.",

It was definitely busy, but the whole team was very accomodating. We ended up having a few more people with us as well, and it was no problem for them. Our friends had actually went the day before and liked it so much they wanted to come back!  The Ghost pepper wings were FANTASTIC! I love spicy foods and this was right up my alley. My husband tried them, even though we knew they were too hot for him, and he liked the flavor as well. His mouth was on fire after, but the manager came by with a glass of milk for him. Very thoughtful.   I also had the chopped salad, and it was huge! I couldn't finish it! I liked that the dressing was served on the side as well. So many times I feel salads as overdressed for my liking, and this way I am able to control that.   Dessert was the smores, and by far my favorite thing I ate my entire weekend in Vegas, I am still dreaming about it.   My companions all said there food was great and had zero complaints. One of them ordered the same lobster tacos as the previous day, but he did comment that they were a little dryer than that day before, but the pieces of lobster and shrimp were much bigger (maybe just a small ratio mishap, no one every complains about extra lobster)! He was still very happy with his meal.   Great spot to people watch, good prices, and good food.",

    "text": "My family and I had breakfast here solely for the reason of bottomless mimosas. My sister and I shared pancakes and the Urban platter that came with eggs, sausage, and hash browns. My cousins ordered an eggs Benedict and an Urban platter as well. The pancakes were very good, fluffy and sweet. The rest of the food was just okay. Their sourdough toast was as hard as a brick and there was no butter at all on it. When asked for butter, they gave us two small packets of butter to share for our four pieces of toast. The hash browns were bland and so we added salt and pepper to make it taste like something. My cousin also said her eggs Benedict sauce was bland and it wasn't what she was expecting.  Although I did not get the bottomless mimosas myself, that was probably the saving grace of this place. All three of my family had 3 mimosas each, in which had a decent amount of alcohol to pay off for the price of them.  Overall, I recommend this place for the bottomless mimosas. The food? Not so much. The service? Decent!",

Pork belly taco sweet and smoky with a kick from sauce and jalepanenos, good but spendy for one taco.  I enjoyed carnitas Mac and cheese spicy but the citrus aftertaste on the carnitas may not be to everyones liking.    Service was good and had decent suggestions.  Charged too much for taco the Bartender Elaine fixed very quickly.  Great service.",

To her defense, our waitress did try to manage expectations in terms of wait time, she was attentive and comped us a drink.   FOOD WAS COLD AND SUB PAR: eggs Benedict, nothing special. Shrimp salad, spinach was okay but the shrimp was GROSS. Tacos, corn tortilla was hard and yet somehow soggy.   SAVE YOUR TIME, MONEY AND ENERGY to go anywhere else.",

Our server, Blue, was on the money with everything, from drinks to menu suggestions (and boy, was he SPOT ON with his recommendations). At one point when the boyfriend spilled his beer all over the table, Blue was on top of helping clean up the mess, as well as replacing our silverware and getting us a new beer. He made sure we were taken care of for our entire meal. We were so happy, we asked to talk to the manager to give him and his employees kudos for helping making our New Year's epic and memorable.  The food was also AMAZING. We ordered a few appetizers and it was a great amount of food to fill us up. I suggest the brussel sprouts. Blue did and they are to die for.  That being said, I will be sad if I don't see a Tom's Urban opening in Salt Lake City in the next year.",

Our waiter was actually really nice and explained thing to us, but we had to wait a bit to get seated in this awkward area. That was not an issue though, just something to mention. No stand to indicate where we should wait.  Next, the menu. It looked amazing! So delicious and descriptive and imaginative. Now if only they could follow through on the execution, it would have been a wonderful meal.  We ordered Calamari, small plate mac n cheese with the pork, side of creamed spinach and a burger. The calamari was the best thing by far. My BF said the burger was good, but I didn't have a bite so I can't judge. The side of creamed spinach was nice, but not great. Just sort of eh. The mac n cheese was made with american cheese. Or velveeta. Either way, it was just odd. I mean, kinda tasty in the way that I could eat it and didn't need to send it back, but not so much that I would ever order it again.  Overall, I think I may skip this place next time around, unless I read they get their act together and get some better quality food.",

Everyone we asked, \"what's good here?\"  They had recommendations- and best of all- they said what they DON'T like- which, honestly... I don't think anyone at any other restaurant has ever said to me.  It made a huge difference knowing what to avoid.  I had the chicken &pancake- savory sweet.  Get the sauce on the side!  Wow- it's HOT!  It is not buffalo sauce... it's much hotter.  We also had the Brussel sprouts, and the steak nachos- yum!  Someone had the potsticker salad which he was practically licking the plate- looked amazing!  Someone else had the Figgy piggy sandwich- fog spread, ham, cheese grilled... didn't even leave me a bite!?  I had the sangria rojo- great taste!  My 4 star is that I don't like how expensive the food/drinks are.  I understand- you're in business- and the restaurant is not likely affiliated with the casino- and the rent is probably astronomical... BUT- $9 for a sangria mixed drink? $6 and it would have been 5 stars here, folks.",

We were very disappointed when we asked for the menus and were told they \"stopped doing that already\". We already paid for parking and schlepped through the casino to try this place so we stayed.  The waiter was kinda pushy suggesting I not get a happy hour drink but pay for a larger one and convinced my husband not to do a beer flight. I decided on the happy hour Tom's backyard lemonade and he got a beer he's had before. Both drinks were good, mine was plenty big enough. We got a couple happy hour bites to start and they were good, nothing special. Then we started to notice that we were swatting away flies, that was pretty annoying. Was also confusing until we realized part of the restaurant is open to the street so I guess flies just get in. I took the waiters recommendation and ordered the lobster & shrimp Mac n cheese and my husband ordered the pickle brined fried chicken with grits. The chicken and grits were both very good! My Mac n cheese was not. The pasta was cooked perfect and the cheese was tasty but overall it had a very \"fishy\" smell and taste. After finding a 3rd bite of uncleaned shrimp I couldn't handle eating any more. All I could think of was how many shrimp veins had I eaten?!?  We decided to not bother with desert. We had planned to spend $40 ea + $ on drinks for a pre-fix 3 course meal for restaurant week, our check was instead about $75.",

    "text": "This morning I dine with my dearest Sprinkle, alongside Papa and Gerty Sausage. A wise man once said, \"let's eat brunch.\" I agree!  We started with a round of coffees. Normal!  Sprinkle gets the first food - the Birthday Poptart. \"It's brown inside,\" she exclaims! \"It tastes like brown.\" I couldn't agree more, Sprinkle. In fact, the not-so-flaky pastry was filled with brownie. If I'm being frank, she seemed a bit let down, dear readers. I'm not sure if she'll rebound after this one. There weren't even sprinkles on it. The photo had promised her sprinkles...  Papa has gotten the Three Little Pigs omelette. \"The hash browns are weird. They are really thin and mostly cheese.\" \"Not bad...\" He mutters between bites.  \"This is one of my favorite times being stuffed by 3 kinds of meat.\" Care to elaborate, Papa? Perhaps it's best that this secret doesn't leave the bedroom...  Gerty ordered the Boulder Club. \"It's very tall.\" Allow me to explain; this sandwich has three slices of bread. Imagine a Big Mac, but in sandwich form (all you trolls out there that want to argue a burger is in the sandwich family, take it offline!) \"It's not anything real special,\" she says. Sorry, Gerty!  Sprinkle has received the Hangover Slopper. Whoa whoa whoa! The meaty burger is soaked in egg juice and salsa. I try to determine what is more moist: Sprinkle's watering mouth, or the meaty burger. I will say that it is a tie. \"Shmeh,\" she ultimately determines. \"Soggy, shmeh, and undercooked.\"  Two little birdies pop into the restaurant. This is a sign! Perhaps we have two new best friends. This day is complete.  I have ordered the Huevos Benedicto. I must say, this entree is quite delicious! It is a nice balance of spice and sweet. The pork is of great quality and the green chili hollondaise sauce is indeed unique! Tom of Tom's Urban, I am proud to be your tuba tooter. I will climb to the tallest building and sing the praises of your Huevos Benedicto, but I will be so high up that I'm afraid no one will hear me. Do you ever feel alone, Tom? Do long silences make you uncomfortable? Tom?  The Sausage family has had another successful outing, all thanks to Tom. He is welcome in our home anytime. We will prepare plenty of activities throughout the house - in the kitchen, yard, bedroom, etc. Thank you, Tim's Orphan!",

Their Bloody was ok but they couldn't keep the Irish coffee coming fast enough, day two.  Outdoor bar seating was nice considering the weather and accompanied by an attentive barkeep who offered me a sample of something on tap I was looking at.  The eggs Benedict the first day was average; the ham being the most boring part of the \"sandwich\" while the sandwich the second day (my coworker got the first day) was very good and outrageously huge.  Considering it was right off the strip and opened at 7 am, I'd make this a pretty good option if I have (yes, have) to go back to Vegas again.",

    "text": "My beautiful Canadian-ish homegirl and I were walking around the strip trying to find a place for brunch.   I suggested Tom's Urban because my hubby and I walked by it the night prior when we walked over to shake shack.  Tom's urban's location is great, right on the strip, patio, with lots of people watching from every corner.  We were seated in a nice spot where we were able to enjoy the music and watch the hungovers make their way around vegas.  At the time we went, around 1030a, the whole menu was available which made it difficult to choose a meal.  She's vegetarian though, so it does help with narrowing our options.  We decided to share the veggie omelet which came with toast and hashbrowns. And we also ordered the lemon blueberry poppyseed pancakes. Our dishes came fairly quickly and those plates were huge--definitely meant for sharing.  Our omelet was full of veggies and nicely cooked. I especially liked that it wasn't greasy like many omelets can be. The potatoes and toast were also awesome sides.    I think my friend and I would agree, however, that the star of that meal was the plate of pancakes. Those pancakes were light, very fluffy and very tasty even without the butter or syrup.  At some point, we were just picking at the pancakes!!   So good. so good.",

    "text": "This dining experience exceeded my expectations. Especially for a meal at 12:30am on a Friday night.   As much as I enjoy eating out, I am not enthusiastic about eating out when visiting Vegas. I expect every restaurant in and near the hotels to offer decent options. I also expect most to have a cool, trendy or themed decor but that's about it. And usually the places are good, but you could easily leave just as satisfied if you had gone to the place next door instead. Or having grabbed a slice of pizza from the fast food joint. Tom's Urban has changed my mind. The food is so much more than the Vegas status quo of decent food.  The menu was pretty extensive and most items (breakfast, sandwiches and spiked milkshakes) are offered 24/7. And if you are having a difficult time choosing between the sweet potato fries and the famous shoestring garlic fries, you can get half and half. How's that for awesome and accommodating?!?!  After a long day and no plans of retreating, we decided to refuel, enjoy the sights, lights and a different location on the strip. We perused the menu and decided to stop in. From the moment we sat down until the time we left, we were pleased. And I seriously enjoyed our dining experience enough to have double back which says a lot.   The service was phenomenal, the patio seating is one of the best on the strip, the food was absolutely, positively delicious and my drink was superb. If I had to choose one word the describe this visit, it would be outstanding.   I came, I thoroughly enjoyed it and will return.",

As we started to review the menu we noticed that the omelettes were made with four eggs.  Holy heck, that is one big omelette, let's just share.  We went with a Denver, hash browns, and my husband got a side of grits, and I added a side of fruit.  This was plenty of food to share. I will say that the omelette was a bit overdone and dry. It was crispy around the edges.     Our server was prompt, and quick to refill my Husbands coffee.  The bloody Mary's here are also very good.",

Best food and service in town. This time our server, Oscar, was out to impress though. He was the most attentive and knowledgeable server we have had in a long time. I would return just based on the customer service Oscar provided.",

    "text": "First off, great showing of customer service by Tom's Urban reaching out to me after my last visit and encouraging me to come back. And second, I'm so glad I did come back.  On our return visit: - 'A' on the cocktails. Perfectly made and tasty. Tip: Get the bacon bourbon bloody mary. - 'A' on the service. Michael was a wonderful server. Friendly, helpful, attentive, funny, etc. The complete opposite of our last experience. - 'A' on the food. We left full and very pleased with our food decisions.  The mac 'n' cheese pot was superb. Far better than I even remembered from my very first visit. And the green chile was even better. It was spicier and more flavorful. And the macaroni was perfectly cooked and was full of cheesy goodness. This is one of the best mac 'n' cheese dishes in Vegas. It's officially in my top 5.  The buffalo wings were great. They're of average size, but very good quality. Cooked well - not too greasy, not too crispy. Excellent sauce coverage. I just wish they were spicier. But the flavors are good and will please those who aren't super spicy fans. (Unfortunately, the ghost pepper sauce was not available as apparently it's not all that popular. Otherwise, we would've been eating those wings.) We opted for both the blue cheese and green chile ranch dipping sauces. Both were excellent. So all needs in my wings were met - quality, sauciness, and good dipping sauces.  The hangover slopper was huge and delicious. This is the regular slopper, but with a fried egg on top. And a runny egg always makes everything even better. We were actually asked how we wanted our burger cooked this time. And it came out nice and edible. And again, the green chile was even better than before. I practically wanted to lick the plate. It was some seriously delicious green chile. And it's awesomely enjoyed when there's a burger and fried egg involved. This is a tasty dish. And it's definitely big enough to share.  All in all, we had an excellent return visit. This spot is back on the list of my favs. If you're looking for tasty comfort food with a twist in a laid-back, enjoyable environment, Tom's Urban is a wonderful choice. And if you like mac 'n' cheese, wings, and/or green chile, you've got to come here.",

It's right on the strip, you can hear the music being played by the Brooklyn Bridge DJ and the people watching is phenomenal.  My recommendations:   1.  Sit in the bar area and enjoy the water misters on a warm, summer night. 2.  Have breakfast for dinner!  My omelette was yummy! 3.  Have a frozen moscow mule (or any happy hour cocktail) and get on with the people watching.   Thank you for a fun second visit, Tom!!",

Just be aware that if you get a seat in the sun, it could get uncomfortably hot. Although they have most sprinklers to help cool down the area.  The waiters/waitresses are quick and friendly and they have your order out very quickly. The food is great and if you check in, you can receive a free order of fried pickles or brussell sprouts.

We had Michael for our server today and he was great. Very knowledgeable about the strip and fun to talk to, great member to be on that staff hands down. The drinks at the bar are also on point. There is thousands of places to eat on the strip but this is our go to for sure. Thanks for never letting us down.",

Brother had one of their burgers (sorry, I can't remember which one). He said it was very good and it was  cooked to order (med rare). I ordered steak and eggs. The filet medallions were excellent. I had ordered my eggs over easy and one of the egg yolks had broke. Next thing I know, a server brings me perfect over easy eggs, since the ones I had on my plate were not as they should be. WOW, that is very nice customer service. I wish I could remember her name...our server was so friendly, as were the rest of the staff we encountered; especially the guy that brought me more eggs.

We went to the Bar never got greeted by the bartender she looked like she wasn't very happy to be there she asked us what we wanted to drink and gave us the food menu. We order our drinks and right away I smelled bleach inside the glass I looked over the food menu but the smell of the glass started to bother me... I could not  bring myself to order anything the vibe was off the smell was just nasty it wasn't a very long visit we left right away...  We went back to our local bar and enjoyed the rest of the night.:-) finally!",

Before deciding to go to Tom's Urban, I read the restaurant description promoting itself \"serving an eclectic blend of the world's favorite street food.\" When I got to the restaurant and looked over the menu, it offered sliders, pizzas and street tacos. When I read \"world's favorite street food\" I had entirely different expectations and was expecting more international fare. I come from the perspective of having traveled abroad and eaten street food and was expecting something similar. My bad for having this expectation.",

Had one of the best restaurant experiences I've personally ever had, and it's shocking that it happened at a hotel like New York New York.  Service: 5/5: Our waitress was Ana, who was really nice, and provided really helpful service.  Staff is funny, chatty, friendly, and extremely helpful. They asked us about our day and tried to even make the most out of our trip.  Are here on a Wednesday, so he restaurant was a little slow, and the restaurant was clearly overstaffed, so we got a lot of attention. Upon asking why we were in Vegas, we informed them that Two of us had Birthdays. (One turning 22 and the other 23).  We were given 2 FREE rounds of shots: a raspberry lemon drop and a chocolate cake, and both were DELICIOUS! (That's a total of 20 free shots).   Food: 4.5/5 The pricing is pretty reasonable for Vegas. $15-25 per person. The food was pretty good too, and the portion sizes are fair. The shoestring garlic fries were delicious.  Another thing to know is this place is fairly vegetarian friendly (at least relative to the rest of Las Vegas.) The items were clearly labeled with a (v) icon.",

The filet mignon was so tender that it literally broke apart as you bit into the slider.  The butter-toasted brioche buns and the unique hollandaise sauce enhanced the flavor of this dish.  YOU HAVE TO GET THE FRENCH FRIES TWO WAYS because you need to try both of the fries they offer here.  They are so different, yet equally delectable.  It also comes with two different kinds of ketchup (Moroccan and Caribbean) that compliment their respective fries perfectly.  My friends tried the Big Ass Egg Roll and the Steak Burrito.  Both of them were pretty good.  The Big Ass Egg Roll is basically a huge deep fried burrito, which would get tiring to eat after awhile unless you love fried foods.  I had two cocktails: the Ultimate Peach Cosmo and the Skyy High Roller. The Ultimat Peach Cosmo is a little sweet, but was still delicious.  I loved both of them and would recommend them.  The service could use a bit of work, but I think it is just because they recently opened and are still working on the kinks.  I would definitely return here again, especially to try out the outdoor patio bar area when the weather gets warmer!",

Sunday: breakfast over at 11:00am (boo, no brunch)   Food: took long which would have been ok, IF our food was made correctly. It wasn't. Both burgers were cooked Rare instead of Medium. Also, they brought out the wrong burger to my friend all together... Or rather put on extra condiments that weren't listed on the menu. My mini Mac and cheese was a little soupy, tasted ok. I will say the Garlic Fries were really really good. Pizza was greasy and not crisp. You gotta be fast, or you gotta be good. --- neither happened for us today. Wasn't cheap either!   Our server was kind of a d-bag the manager wasn't too friendly. But the hostesses and food runners were helpful.  **Update** The manager tells me they are open for breakfast all day.",

Overpriced food attempting to be chic, horrible selection of beers unless you're a metrosexual hipster that pretends to love swill and horse water (a euphemism).   Honestly, I'd be surprised if any of the food isn't prepackaged. It might as well be the cardboard packaging itself, as both my wife's and my food were totally bland and utterly tasteless.  Again, the service... Don't go here unless you enjoy being ignored. And if you do wish to be ignored, why not go across the street to Dick's Last Resort where there is at least comedy entertainment value. Whoever imagined this place was sorely mistaken. Don't be fooled, the menu items appear palatable and creative, they aren't. The service appears friendly and expedient, it isn't. People were dissatisfied in droves.   Eat here if you want to take part in disappearing Vegas history, because this place is about to be demolished for something bigger, better, and grander.  Bleecccchhh!",

We started with the \"crispy\" Brussel sprouts and a small beer. When it came out, the Brussels sprouts had no crisp to it whatsoever, but atleast the taste was still pretty good. Also, my beer took almost 15 min to come out when the place was not really busy and they gave me the wrong size. I also ordered the truffle Swiss burger which was really good, but you got to eat it quick because the bread gets soggy quick. My gf order the smothered burrito with adobo chicken and it was very flavorful. The tortilla that's used for it is very thick which I didn't like too much. At the end of the order, the credit card machine was down so I had to pay cash. Luckily I had cash that day. I understand they have been opened for only 2 weeks now but still got a few kinks to fix. I'd still come back but probably try something different.",

Nate was my server and he recommended the club sandwich which was just perfect! Great fresh avocado and cucumber was just the right touch.

Since the menu at Tom's Urban looked interesting (and because there was no wait to be seated), we decided to check it out. Mistake -- BIG mistake. If Tom's Urban was entered into the NCAA Tournament of Bad Service, they would be the Kentucky Wildcats of the restaurant industry. Their servers and managers were a combination of slow, inattentive, ignorant and disinterested.  At one point, we were pretty sure we were the \"before\" crowd of one of those reality TV shows about restaurants on the verge of closing because  of incompetent service. Bottom line: I will never visit one of their restaurants again...and I learned the lesson that...we should have waited the hour for Shake Shack. In keeping with the basketball theme and quoting Sir Charles: \"turble.\"",

Sandwich, salads and few appetizers and of course the apps were cold.  We ordered a ginger soda. The sever didn't tell they don't offer it and went and poorer it from \"the bar area\" and came in 6oz glass.  After one refill we had to pay $12.45 for it. Her explanation was that they don't have a Bartender for the servers today and she had to go to the bar and get it from there. Didn't bring all this the to the management. They looked very careless about everything anyway.  One lady came out of no where and ask as how was everything without presentation of who she is etc. just send her away with quick ok.  Her clothes were covered with bunch of anal hair and i even didn't want to talk to her.  We live in Vegas and we go out at least few Times a week and for Vegas standards this place its a disappointment. Sorry",

The eggs were inedible, they used so much vinegar when poaching them that they were sour, gummy, and left a film on my teeth. The \"secret\" to poached eggs is actually just using fresh eggs, you dont even need vinegar and if you do use it, it's just a smidge, they shouldn't taste like vinegar. The hash browns which I swear had a (v) on the menu were actually a blob of fried and congealed cheese with some shoestring potatoes in there. I'm not vegan but I don't eat dairy so I was unpleasantly surprised when I got my food. My husband got the bacon skillet which was not as scary as my order but very greasy and although he could typically eat like a horse he picked around and left half which says something. Place was slow when we were there and the waitress was very nice and only charged me for the avocado which is all I wound up eating.",

We were so frustrated, we didn't wanna send it back a 3rd time.  The salad was also limp & old, obviously straight out of a bag.  Crappy food & service.  I live here & actually work for a sister company on the strip.  I took my cousins there from out of town, pretty embarrassed I did.  For 4 people, we paid $180!  Btw, how can the cook mess up on grilled cheese sandwich? -cold too!  I also witnessed another disappointed patron who returned their food & eventually left pissed off.  U can relay this review to your VP of Operations, Doug Winter.  It was just a terrible experience going to your property",

Note, if you want to have a conversation with the people you are with make sure to sit close, the music is super loud.    We ordered drinks and our food. Drinks came in about 10 minutes, which consisted of a Pepsi and an iced tea.  Our food didn't come out for 45 minutes and when it arrived it was obvious that it had been done for a while and forgotten in back.  Since we were hungry we ate and just wanted to leave.  Mind you the waitress, who I believe was named Ashley, never came around once to refresh our drinks until we were done and wanting the check. Had the food been hot and the music been a little less blaring, would easily give 4 stars.  But was a terrible experience that won't be repeated ever.",

The garlic shoestring fries with the jerk ketchup and the Cinnamon sweet potato fries were perfect! My one year old loved them too! For dinner, I had the \"Big A- Eggroll\" and my husband had the lobster and crab mac and cheese. Mine was good, a little spicy and tough to chew, but good flavor. I tried the Mac and cheese and it was surprisingly good! I normally think Mac and cheese is bland, but with the lobster and crab, it was great! We got a cherry homemade pop tart for dessert, and I have to say, it was the most disappointing part of the meal. It was cold and kinda soggy and the icing was too sweet. But, overall, it was a great place, good food, great service, and I'd definitely go back and bring friends!",

She filled us in on some interesting things to see around Vegas for our next trip when we rent a car! The food was so good, I got a burrito with bacon and my husband ordered pancakes. Everything was so good! The servings are quite large some make sure to come hungry!",

We chose his place based on other Yelp reviews and menu.   I wish I could give a bette rating but....we ordered the Urban Bloody Marys and although tasty, the advertised fried jalapenos did not come and when asked our server informed us they did not have them. This is not enough to penalize by two stars but then came the food. Everyone ordered something different...my food came about 10 minutes after everyone else's. At our table was the Piggy Piggy...tasty but the toasted bread was a little burnt. I ordered the Crispy Chicken and Corn Pancake. Although my chicken was wonderfully crispy and spicy, the pancake was cold. .   Service was wonderful from the hostess station to our waitress. I would definitely say give this restaurant a try.",

Our group arrived at the outside entrance and asked for a table in which the hostess replied she didn't have anything, even though the restaurant had about 10 open tables just on the patio itself. She said the bar was available so we sat there, it was windy and a little cold outside. Later I found out there was a huge bar inside with about 20 seats available, which she would have mentioned that so we weren't as cold.   Our bartender was nice and our drinks delivered in a timely manner. Our food, however, came out all at different times. We had 5 in our group and each plate came out 5-7 minutes separate from each other which I thought was super weird. The food was ok, nothing too crazy. My pulled pork sandwich was a little dry but the sweet potato fries were great.   The restaurant itself is huge. From the inside of NYNY it looked small until you actually walked in. There is plenty of bar space and indoor outdoor tables. The menu had quite a selection and the cocktails were tasty. I just wished the service was a bit better.",

I don't know if soda is less but that seems kind of high to me. But, it is Vegas.   The tree hugger benedict was mediocre. The edges of the English muffin were quite tough. Nothing special about the hollandaise. The eggs were poached perfectly though. Hash browns were not brown at all. They looked anemic and were not hot. They also seemed quite dry. If they're made fresh I think I'd rather have frozen.  I'm not sure if I'll try them again on future visits. Maybe I should try lunch or dinner instead.",

Service was prompt and attentive, food came out pretty quick. Princess had the big egg roll, and yes it's a meal. Hot, nice balance and served hot, with a side of tots. It was a little sweet for my taste, but she liked it. The lobster mac was very good. They use the velvetta/American style sauce which is not my favorite. It was topped with cheddar, baked and came out piping hot, so that saved it. They use a nice noodle, ALOT of seafood and overall a nice balanced dish. Nice vibe to the place and wasn't buried at 6 on a Sunday. It's attached to New York casino so stop by and get a great meal at a fair price in this crazy town.",

    "text": "Delicious and affordable brunch place right on the strip!!   Thanks to the suggestion of our waiter, the BF and I decided to share an omelet. The omelets are huge so I'm really glad that we did! We ordered a make your own with avocado, bacon and goat cheese. They accidentally used cheddar instead of goat cheese, but provided us with a side of goat.   We also ordered a side of garlic fries. Yum! You can never go wrong with fries. Those two items were definitely enough to fill us up! The meal cost about $20 in total. Great price, especially for the quality and quantity of the food.   The only thing that keeps this from being a 5 star review is that the service was really slow. We didn't see our waiter for the majority of our visit. It took a really long time for a water refill or to even see anyone to ask about getting some of the goat cheese. I noticed the restaurant had a lot of empty tables but there was still a wait when we first got there so I'm assuming they were understaffed.   Even with the slow service, it was definitely a great brunch place and somewhere I'd like to come back to on my next trip to Vegas.",

We were having an early dinner, so they were offering their happy hour menu. We ordered tacos (pork and chicken - $4 each), pork baos ( $4 for 2 baos), and the split order of fries. The tacos were nothing special and the pork was dry. The baos were just off, the pork belly was hard and the bao (which is normally soft) had a rough consistency on the outside. The only memorable thing about this meal was the garlic fries - those we really good. Skip the sweet potato fries and just go for the garlic ones.  Service was great though.",

Great area on strip for people watching. JoAnn our server was awesome. She made several recommendations and even questioned my manhood when I ordered a regular sized beer so I manned up and a red bull vodka to show her. Haha! I ordered a few more after too. She was super cool. I stopped by a week later but didn't run into her.  The food is great. I ordered an egg white omelette and they brought me a regular one but they fixed it. Took a while but manager came by and told me my meal was on the house. Sweet! I still had to pay for drinks but I was like nothing beats free. I ordered a kale salad with it as well; just cutting carbs. I did share the house made pop tart which was off the hook.  After a long fun day at the pool I brought my friends here for dinner. Sat on the patio on the strip. That was very entertaining bc of all the debauchery happening. It's Vegas so it's a normal Friday night. All of the food was delicious.  Stopped by on my 3rd morning and ate at bar area. Laurie took care of me. She was awesome! She knows her golf courses in the area and gave me a bunch of recommendations for my golf trip the following week. Funny thing happened again when I ordered the egg white omelette. They brought me a regular one. They fixed it but I payed for it this time. It was 8am and some guy was doing shots at the bar. Overall, I really liked the atmosphere and the food was great. Best part was the service. I stopped by again a week later to see Laurie but she was off. I had a great time golfing. Thanks, Laurie. P.S. Badlands was brutal.",

My only gripe is having the waiter talk me into getting a larger cocktail. I didn't look at the price but to go from a small to a large is a considerable difference! We paid $23 for a weak Mule Kick.

We requested fresh fries and got a second set that was even greasier and only a tad less chewy. We requested the potsticker apps to come out first but they arrived with our main meal. They were also cold and soggy. The presentation was totally unappetizing (wilted greens with sad garlic slices). The Mac and cheese with pork and green chile was the best of bunch, but definitely not memorable.   Expensive mediocre food for a casual restaurant.   They have a nice strip-view deck that will be lovely in the summer. Go for drinks and the ambiance, skip the food.",

Ordered two happy hour items (the fries and hummus) and it was obvious both had been sitting out for awhile... Fries limp and cold... The pita with the hummus was dried out. Blurgs! I then ordered the steak sandwich (can't remember exact item name) that I asked for medium rare. Gross... Chewy meat on a bun surrounded with unappetizing lettuce that had weird dollops of what looked like mayonnaise. Is that the best they could do for an entree that was over $20?! Sad.   The only positive were two things: The service staff and the drinks. I would give Tom Urban's another chance to prove me wrong... So get your act together please! Make it a priority to have pride in your food and what comes out of the kitchen, hot and fresh... My impression must be changed but now the ball is in your court!",

The host at the lectern outside seated us right away. We requested seating inside, as it was already blazing hot outside. This guy had a lot of tattoos and long hair and looked like a rocker, but despite the gruff appearance, he was SO friendly and nice, we warmed up to him immediately. And our server was a doll; very attentive, brought us waters and drinks right away, went over the menu and gave good feedback on the many, many options.   I forget what hubby ordered but he liked it a lot. It was some commonplace breakfast fare. I ordered a veggie omelet which was huge, and I gave most of it to my husband. It was delicious, albeit a tad too buttery for me.   Portions were large and, we thought a great value for the prices charged.  A shout-out to the interior decor and color scheme. We really loved the vibe here: soft, cool aquas and warm ambers, suspended glass orb lighting, wood planks as art panels on the wall... it all made for a soothing, warm dining environment. A nice change of pace from the frenetic neon decors of the Strip. And it was cool how the exterior wall to the Strip was totally opened up, so this was more of an inside-outside space. Very airy and open and large.   We loved this place and our meal here and agreed, we'd definately return.",

It was her second day on the job there, but our drinks showed she was pretty experienced at pouring.   I ordered the poppyseed blueberry pancakes, which filled a huge plate and were bigger than my big appetite could handle. My boyfriend got the Treehugger with bacon eggs Benedict, and claims they were the best he's ever had.   The drinks were fantastic as well - The Dark and Stormier was delicious and very boozy, and the Tom's Cup had great flavour. I also tried a salted caramel rum milkshake - it would be worth a trip back just for that.   Overall, excellent place, great food, great drinks, great atmosphere.

    "text": "This place definitely surprised me. It's at the Nyny I'm here all the time and have not tried it. I got the lobster and shrimp mac and cheese, a Cuban sandwich, and cheddar avocado mash potatoes.  I give the Cuban sandwich a 4 out of 5. It could have been better with more carnitas on it overall it was good just a little short on carnitas.  The lobster and shrimp Mac and cheese was on point! A huge portion too which made it easy to share and worth the $22 it cost. Lots of lobster and shrimp.  The mash potatoes were also good and avocado adds and extra creaminess too it. That with the Mac was a little to much cheese for me and I love cheese.  Good did take a little long to make it out and the place was not overly busy. Service was nice they could have checked on me a little more. If the prices are few dollars cheaper and service a little faster I would give 5 stars.",

We walk in and half the restaurant is empty and the bar had maybe 4 groups sitting at it. We sit down at the bar and do receive menus quickly, yet just as quickly my husband notices a giant glob of syrup on the bar. He asks for a wet rag to wipe it up and we have to wait about 10 minutes for someone to come wipe it up. While wiping it up the waitress asks if our drink order has been taken yet and we say no and she walks away and starts serving another customer who walked in after us. At this point having waited almost 20 minutes just to order drinks we end up leaving, since we don't have eternity to wait for breakfast. Seriously the most pathetic bar staff I've ever encountered!",

When we finally got seated, we noticed it was only half full, so why did we have to wait?  When I bought this to their attention, they said they didn't have enough waiters.  First of all, it was the weekend.  What kind of place staffs half the waiter needs on the weekend?  Then it was March Madness, the busiest weekend of the entire year.  Boneheads.

Only decent thing was $5 beer on happy hour.

After being greeted by the hostess, she had asked if we would like to sit in the lounge or in the front lounge/bar area which they would be able to seat us faster (don't know why she would say that because it was only at 15-20% capacity during our lunch visit) so not busy at all.  Our waitress (Jenn) was pleasant, took our order of a regular cheeseburger and my wife had an avocado sandwich, and I had to repeat myself stating that I wanted my burger well done, as she was walking away she turned around said \"medium well??\" :0/  No, well done as in no red please.   10min goes by.....nothing yet, ok. No problem.  20min goes by and we look over and our waitress Jenn is folding about 50 napkins.. Ok, maybe give them another 5min and ask if our food is ready.  35min goes by and by now you would think placing a patty on the grill and some French fries would be done right? Nope...   43min and we finally look over to Jenn and she's still very busy folding another 50 napkins, we get her attention and she says let me go check.. And wouldn't you know it? She comes back with our food and said \"sorry we were just waiting for the fries to finish\" wtf?!? I don't know about you but since when do fries take 43min to cook?   Food was ok, you can tell it wasn't hot and fresh off the grill and the service was below average.  Had a MUCH better service at Cabo Wabo across the street.",

My favorite part about Tom's Urban is the sauces.  Fantastic dipping sauces from the Moroccan ketchup to the ghost pepper sauce on the wings.  This time around we had the ghost pepper wings and buffalo sliders.  The wings are killer.  They will burn your stomach for sure.  They will make you tear up.  They are exactly s I had hoped when ordering ghost pepper wings - 5/5.  The buffalo sliders were fine.  A little bland, plain with only celery and sauce on the chicken, but tasty nonetheless.  Beer selection definitely could be better.  I love the location and atmosphere - Tom's . Urban seriously could be a contender for best place to watch a game.  However, the beer selection is not good and doesn't tread past the usual macros.  A few good selections like Stone and Dogfish, but no rotating or even good local brews.  Food great, beer average, location terrific.",

I hoped to inquire about gluten free items. We decided to try anyway and upon entering the restaurant and speaking to the waitress when we asked about gluten free she started talking about vegan food. After some frustration, because when I want gluten free directing me to your gluten filled vegan options is not the way to go, we decided we would have to go eat elsewhere as they apparently have nothing gluten free or just didn't want to offer us any gluten free dishes. The staff is rude and incompetent. I really wonder how such a place stays in business when there is so much competition in the area? Just go elsewhere, the options are endless in Vegas, don't make this one of your stops. Of course if you like greasy cheap, low quality food then stop in. Thats all we saw when we looked at other peoples plates.",

At the suggestion of our server we went with the fried pickles vs the brussel sprouts and were were not disappointed.  The sliced pickle batter was light and crispy and the pickles weren't overly salty.  For my meal, I went with the cheeseburger sliders and fries, finished off with a Bloody Mary.  The slider bun was a little overwhelming, so I did remove 1 side to reduce the bun size, it was fine at that point.  The Bloody Mary was actually very good, but definitely spicy.  Since I'm not a veteran \"mary\" drinker, I could only finish 3/4 of the drink, but it was enjoyable.",

Really cool inside/outside bar physically on the strip walk-way which is a cool atmosphere! We sat at the bar for a few apps and were greeted promptly and offered drinks! We ordered the limoncello glazed wings which were phenomenal. I've never have wings with that particular dressing but man they were amazing to say the least. Also got the seafood Mac and cheese which was a very generous portion and tasted delicious not too much cheese where it over powered the seafood which was perfect for my linking. Obviously being on the strip the prices tend to be a little steep (which is expected) being a local, it kinda stings to pay those prices but it is what it is. If you're in the area for an event I would highly recommend checking out Tom's!",

Took quite a long time to get a drink order in. Ordered the urban Bloody Mary and it was pretty bad. Looked similar to a well Bloody Mary from the sports book. Did not have ingredients listed on menu.  Bartender had really bad costumer service, refills were scarce, getting closed out took way too long for barely anybody in the bar. She was more concerned about scoring hockey tickets from a regular than she was hospitable to people at the bar.   Ordered shrimp and grits for $23 not worth the price. Shrimp were good size and pretty spicy, it had good flavor but come on $23 for shrimp and grits.    If you're looking for a place to eat before Knights games, skip this one.",

The food is amazing but the service was not that great. The server forgot my friend's Philly cheesesteak sandwich. We went there for breakfast before hitting the road so she was starving because we all hadn't eaten since the night before. She eventually got her food but it was a struggle getting a discount since the rest of the group ended up waiting longer until her breakfast was served.   I also would be wary of going here if you're looking for a quick bite. We waited longer here than any other restaurant from that weekend trip. It wasn't even that busy (we went during breakfast hours when most people are still sleeping in Vegas) and it still was a two-hour thing.   The food is good though once it comes so if you want to kick back with friends, check it out!",

We opted for bottomless mimosas as it's a better bang for our buck. Even if we only drank two, we'd be saving money. We had early dinner plans so we shared a Cuban sandwich with a side of lemon rosemary tots and cheesy hashbrowns. The food was really good. The pork in the Cuban was tender and moist. The cheesy hashbrowns were delish. The tots were meh. The mimosas kept flowing and were quite strong. After about 4 I was a bit tipsy. If I'm in the area again I would return. Hopefully it won't take twenty minutes to place an order.",

    "text": "Tom's Urban was a great choice for dinner. My sister was in town visiting, and we had just left downtown and wanted a nice sit down spot to grab a late meal. We got there around 11:30pm on a Sunday, and it was not terribly busy so no wait. The atmosphere was great, and we enjoyed the variety of music (and accompanying music videos) being played. We were able to enjoy nice conversation and admire the unique art work and decor around our booth. The menu had quite a bit of variety and it looked like there were some really unique drink options and cocktails (although we didn't order any).  We are both health conscious eaters, and I follow a strict paleo diet so I was concerned about finding options that would work for me. I was pleasantly surprised to find that they offered tacos in lettuce cups, and that's what each of us ordered. I got the Mahi Mahi tacos, and my sister got the Poached Shrimp & Lobster tacos- both were delicious! The Mahi Mahi was so juicy, well-seasoned and flavorful! There was a guacamole and pick de gallo mixed topping that was simple and not too spicy, but really added a great pop! With fresh orange and lime to squeeze over the tacos, they were perfectly zesty, sweet, and had a lot of texture (not to mention delicious)! The Hibiscus tea was really great and refreshing too. No sweetener necessary, and it still had a great taste and sweetness.  I had a large appetite, so I was left wanting more after my 3 tacos. They didn't come with a side, which would be my only complaint about the food. For the price, I would like to have a little bit larger portions or a side included with the meal.  But the service and time waiting for food were both quick, and our server was very friendly and helpful. I had some Mlife Rewards points available to use to pay for the meal, but for some reason they were unable to process that request, so we missed out on the perk of having earned a free meal from playing so much in the casino. That was a bummer but not a big deal, and our server was very friendly and apologetic about it.  Can't wait to try it again in the future!",

My husband and I had the Adobo Chicken Tacos $16.99 each! They were just a basic simple small taco. This should be under small plate section because you get 3 tiny tacos with no beans no rice nothing....nata!! Service was extremely slow and though it didn't bother us our server apologized numerous times throughout our stay.  We both had two 12 oz draft beers and for this the bill was $80.00 with a tip!! Yes the strip has become very expensive to dine and drink which is fine if you get a good dining experience but the unprofessional reception desk, small portion and huge price tag is just silly AND we left hungry!

When I ordered my cocktail, I also asked for a glass of water. It never showed up, and no one refilled my wife's water glass. We had to remind our server about one of the entrees that probably would not have showed up had we not asked. At one point, our server came by to do the \"How is everything?\" but he failed to slow down, stop, make eye contact, or give us an opportunity to say anything in response. That was rude. I can tell he felt really busy, but I don't think he should have been. The place was NOT busy.

We decided to dine at Tom Urbans inside the  NYNY and we're immediately  greeted by a manager name Joe  and were seated at the bar . Our bartender Jeff greeted us with a big smile eventhough he was busy he took the time to go over some of their specialty cocktails my favorite was their version of the Moscow mule and my girlfriend had a peach cosmo . After few a few drinks we all got hungry and decided to dine at the patio . The patio is outdoor overlooking the strip with beautiful views  . Our waitress Miranda was hands down the sweetest and nicest waitress I've been served by she was attentive and always had our water filled and the food was amazing and came out quickly . The favorite dishes of the night were the truffle pizza , carnitas  nachos and the Cuban sandwich :) . Overall it was an amazing experience , highly recommend to anyone on the strip looking for great spot yo watch games over great food, drinks and service .",

Food: Had the shrimp and avocado salad which was good, except it was served on a plate so my lettuce was spilling all over because there was so much lettuce. Maybe I'm just sloppy, but it would be much better suited in a big bowl! And like I said, lettuce to \"good stuff\" ratio was off. Flavors were good though, especially the fried capers.  Atmosphere: The place is way bigger than I thought it was, but kind of spread out into sections, so I actually really liked the vibe. Nice decor, big bar, great location right on the strip. There is outdoor seating as well.  Service: Just ok. Nothing special, but nothing to complain about except my beer was forgotten right in the beginning of our time there.  I will go back to drink probably, and I would like to try some new things, but not my favorite spot as of yet.",

It was early enough for breakfast but after checking out the menu my wife and I decided on a delicious shrimp, spinach, and avocado salad and filet mignon sliders; not exactly bacon and eggs but the menu is so diverse and fun we were inspired to expand the breakfast horizon. I recommend everything about this restaurant, from the strip-people-watching on the patio, to the helpful and friendly service from the staff, to the quality of the food. It's not really a restaurant that is going to show up on Zagat, but it is high quality, clean, very well done with a successful system for service and quality food. Very relaxed easy vibe and inviting. Go there. You will not be disappointed.",

Street tacos- pork, steak, and chicken. The chicken was average and the pork had great flavor but a little too salty for my taste.  The steak had great flavor and my favorite of the 3.  Pineapple upside down cake- Unique twist, as the cake is drizzled with caramel and mango sauce. The mango is quite differentiating. It was delicious! Would definitely order again.

We arrived at the front of Tom's Urban and after an unusual five-minute wait in front of a half-full restaurant with a reservation, we were sat in the back corner of the least busy and least visited part of the restaurant. We sat there for over 15 minutes without any service at all. No welcome greeting, drink orders place, nothing. We then decided to get up and leave when one member of the serving team asked if anyone had taken care of us. We replied that they hadn't and walked out of Tom's Urban and went to Bruxie just outside New York-New York inside The Park. Whether or not this restaurant earns my recommendation should be obvious.",

    "text": "I like to go here for lunch.  This is nicely located on the strip at New York New York facing MGM Grand right next to Shake Shack.    The atmosphere is trendy/rustic.  TVs everywhere playing sports or music videos.  A popular place to be on a Friday.  The tables and booths along the wall are nice, but the booths in the middle of the floor were kind of strange.  It's circular shaped, and will probably only fit 6 people at the most.  Just my opinion, not used to these style of booths.    Favorites: Lobster Mac & Cheese and the spicy XL Pickle Brined Crispy Chicken.    Spicy XL Pickle Brined Crispy Chicken: fried chicken strips on another level!  super spicy and filled with dry rub spices.  Comes with parmesan garlic shoe string fries.  Super large portion that is shareable with 2 people.  Lobster Mac & Cheese:  Comes with portions or lobster and shrimp on a hot metal dish.  They are pretty generous with their seafood portions on their mac & cheese.    Not so favorite: steak in chimichurri sauce.  The steak was not tender at all, and a pain in the ass to cut.  There were very few pieces of the steak that was not chewy and somewhat good to eat, but it was tough for the most part.    Price: It's on the strip, so you may somewhat pay \"strip\" prices, but it's not too bad.  Cheaper than most places on the strip.",

Having heard good things about the LA location we decided it was a good choice.  The hostess was extremely nice. She sat us down in Nate's section. After about 10 minutes of waiting for Nate to greet us or let us know he would be with us in a minute we gave up. We decided we'd seek service at the bar.   The bar tender gave us minimal service. Our potsticker and fry appetizer took 20 minutes to finally hit the table. The potstickers tasted like they had freezer burn.  As a small snack I ordered the pop tart. It was cold.   Overall the experience was subpar. We will not be revisiting this establishment nor recommending to others.",

Another server told the a bartender \"a lot people are now at your bar\"  he replied \"they can wait\".  This was Super Bowl Sunday.  Get with the program. They even opened 15 minutes late.

The other two were fine, just couldn't beat the Bahn Mi. Yum!   My SO said his burger was perfect and it filled him up itself, but he ate all of the fries anyways because they were amazing.  Location is perfect, I don't think there is a bad seat in the entire restaurant and the atmosphere is perfect for brunch or an early lunch. The specials are pretty good too in the evening.

The kitchen was going to close in 5 min so we put our order in and she made sure our food would be put in quickly!   I ordered the lemon blueberry poppyseed pancakes... To die for!!! My fiance ordered the Big Ass Egg Roll. I can't believe how delicious and freaking big this egg roll was!! The flavors of both dishes were delicious!   The environment was chill for a Sunday night, but I can def see it being extremely busy! Def would go back next time in Vegas!!",

I got the chicken and cornbread pancakes. It came out wrong initially but they were super quick to fix it. They gave us free dessert to make up for it which was amazing. The chicken was super moist. The pancake was ridiculously huge and awesome. I could have totally made a second meal out of this except that I had nowhere to put leftovers. My husband got the Cuban sandwich which was also pretty good. It was nothing super out of the ordinary but it tasted good and had everything I would have expected. The chocolate cake was to die for, even after it sat in my purse for several hours and got crushed a few times. They had some really interesting items on their menu and good happy hour specials. I'd like to go back and try more things. Also, their prices were really reasonable. We had two sodas and both meals for a little over $40.",

My friends dishes both came with cheese, so they had to remake her dinner.  My steak came.  It was not a filet.  It was a thin cut sirloin that tasted like old betsy.  The tacos came back after the rest of the table was almost done eating and the corn came out with cheese again.  I ate about 4 bites of meat that was over cooked and tasted nasty and just stopped.  I told the waitress I didn't want anything in return but to tell the cook the meat was not good.  He comped the meal, and she was very irritated when she brought the others their bill.  First and last meal there, ever!",

The only drawbacks were that the presentation and plating was sloppy.  Also avoid the skillet corn it tastes nothing like real grilled Mexican street corn.  Service was friendly and fast.  Good place for a quick bite.",

    "text": "Came here hoping for some good breakfast food before our flight back home to San Diego. I ordered the three piglets and my boyfriend ordered the eggs Benedict. I asked for mushrooms in my omelet, didn't get it. The worst was when my boyfriend cut open the egg on top of the eggs Benedict and was hoping for a nice runny egg to ooze over, that didn't happen either. I called the waiter over and told him about my mushrooms and how the egg didn't run on the Benedict, he told me \"sometimes the egg gets cooked a little longer and sometimes, they don't run.\" Didn't say anything about my mushrooms, okay that's fine.   We go on and my boyfriend looked very disappointed. The manager came back and told us he'll give us a discount. Wanted to stop him and say no thanks, take the food back instead. But hey, at least they acknowledged us. He came back with a whomping $4 off?! So I'm paying like $7 for a piece of bread and ham. Worst part is. He finished about half and threw away the rest because the egg was supposed to be the best part. Should've ordered something else. And the coffee cup and utensils were stained and dirty. Something about this place... 4 stars? When they can't even make a signature eggs Benedict. Should've went to Cocos or Dennys, or hey, even McDonald's would've sufficed.",

We were seated inside for our lunch on this occasion which was a bit chilly on account of the air conditioning (however it was extremely hot outside so this maybe wasn't a bad thing), the waitress was so nice and friendly and gave advice on the cocktails and meals available, she also gave us loads of time to decide without pressuring us to order.  I opted for the shrimp po boy sliders, my partner ordered the stack of ribs and the rest ordered the sin city burgers! There was no side with my meal which made it feel quite small, whereas all the other meals came with fries etc.  The cocktail I went for was the sangria rojo which was delicious and some of my party went for the sin city punch, we were divided on that one-some loved it and some hated it lol  All in all this is a lovely wee place for a meal and a drink...next time I'd choose to sit outside for the nice weather.",

So I got the cornbread pancakes and lemon poppy seed pancakes with chicken crisps and tater tots. The flavors of the lemon zest with the poppy seed was DELICIOUS. And the syrup seeping into the cornbread pancake and chicken crisp made my taste buds feel like I was in the South! Pricing was average about $20 per person or less. Go there! It is so worth it!",

Saw this place & it sure looks inviting because of their patio bar & seating. We were greeted by a couple pretty hostesses &a seated by The awesome Michael. He's been really good & friendly to us. We were treated like VIP's and been checked in by him every 10 minutes to make sure we're still good & have everything we need.   Food is amazing, had fried calamari, Brussel sprouts & steak nachos. Ordered a punch bowl called the Grapefruit jailhouse Rita. It's super good & we've been staying here for a couple hours now -yes, writing this review while I'm seating here as some of my friends are watching the Baseball World Series which I'm not a big fan of but they have these tv's all over which makes it more entertaining.  Shout out to Michael! Restaurants need more of you!",

    "text": "In vegas and we were looking for something to eat. As we walked down the strip we came across this place. We walked in and got seated right away. There was a wait if you wanted to sit outsides. So we choose to get seated inside and have lunch. Our waiter was very friendly and on his toes. We looked over the menu and placed our order. Everywhere we go we always order appetizers and notice after the fact that it's to much food. Well this time was no different and not knowing that the serving sizes of the meals were so big we ordered appetizers to start the eating extravaganza.   Mini Mac & Cheese - Pork green chili carnitas with some Pico de gallo and or course mac & cheese. I do have to say it was just OK. I was expecting and nice and cheesy mac & cheese but it was a little soupy. Not what I expected but it was ok.   The Sin City - Can anyone ever go wrong with a burger. This burger was huge and had great flavor. 1/2 pound angus beef toped with american cheese, applewood smoked bacon, BBQ sauce, crispy onions and to seal the deal a fried egg. Yes you heard that right, a fried egg. That egg just add's richness to the burger. Cut the burger in half and only ate one half. IT also came with garlic fries and home made ketchup or at least it tasted home made.   Boulder Club - Now this was a big sandwich. It's a triple decker sandwich stuffed with shaved turkey, havarti cheese, slices of avocado, butter lettuce, tomato, mayo and cucumber all on toasted wheat. My wife really enjoyed it and also did not finish the sandwich because of the size and it also comes with a side of garlic fries.   If you are looking for a nice size meal on the strip stop on by Tom's Urban. You will not be disappointed.",

    "text": "About a decade and a half ago, this storefront was created and opened as ESPN Zone Las Vegas.  The grand opening was a star-studded event with various athletes and actors brought in for the event with live broadcasts on ESPN.  I know because I was one of the ESPN hosts flown in to do my national radio show at this grand opening and stay the entire weekend.  So many good memories from that weekend, such as me inviting a gorgeous friend named Tanysia from LA to come hang out with us and convincing Trey Wingo that she was actually Carmen Electra. (He still thinks it was her to this day)  Jason Alexander of Seinfeld fame was out there too, promoting his big new sit-com on ABC. You probably don't remember it, because it was a complete disaster and was yanked off the network after a handful of episodes.   We had an awesome time, fantastic shows and fun stories such as my pal Dennis Haskins (Yes, everyone's favorite prinicipal) chasing my ESPN producer's friend from USC. I called her Dr. Lush, because she was a damn sexy dentist and she could throw back Red Bull and Vodka like a champ.  Unfortunately, the ESPN Zones in every city died off a handful of years later including this one.   Fast forward to present day and Tom's Urban has completely made this location in NYNY their own with major renovations.  Honestly, it is better than the original tenant. The ESPN Zone was too boxed in, too dark and the menu stunk. Besides, this was Vegas and because ESPN was owned by Disney, nobody could actually make a bet inside the ESPN Zone. They had to go to the sportsbook. Lame.  Tom's Urban really lightened up the place, created a significantly more comfortable atmosphere and knocked out a lot of walls, most notably the ones near the Brooklyn Bridge and Las Vegas Blvd. That is really a nice bar and patio now with great people watching and views of The Strip.  You can still easily watch sports on TV in here, but the place is so much more than that. Excellent draft beer selection, the menu has everything you would want in an American casual dining setting and the Beat the Clock weekday happy hour is also a nice touch.  Put it to you this way: Tom's Urban is everything Beerhaus around the corner is not. If you're attending a hockey game or event at the arena, walk the extra 50+ yards (take the shortcut through the casino) and get a much better experience at Tom's Urban.",

It was about 11:30pm.  The restaurant wasn't too busy, but definitely had a good amount of customers seated.  We started off ordering some drinks while looking at the huge menu.  There were so many choices, it was hard to decide.  I chose the Sin City burger, while my husband opted for the Lobster BLT.  Both of our dinners came with shoestring fries.  My husband loved his Lobster BLT, I was just so-so about my burger.  The burger, the egg, and the crispy onions on the burger were yummy, but the barbecue sauce on it was so spicy, it was almost too hard to eat.  It definitely took away from the flavor of the burger.  Once I scraped the majority of the sauce off, it was delish.  My only other real complaint (if you can even call it that), is that the glasses that our beers came in weren't cold, therefore making the beer not that cold.   All in all, our late night eats were good.  Looking forward to trying something off their breakfast menu next time.",

The craft beer list is very admiral and they even offer two for one Tom Size beers through the MyVegas app. Portions are very large so I'd suggest splitting if you can. Our table started off with the calamari which is fried to perfection and then we split the lobster macaroni and cheese. If you're looking for a creamy, cheesy entree then look no further than their Mac and cheese, it's so amazing! My friend had the bacon breakfast burrito and could barely get through half, but said it was the best breakfast burrito he'd ever had... now that's saying something. I would stay away from the bloody Mary's as they are almost $20 with no refills and just don't do the trick. Cheers!",

The setting is open and clean.  Entrees: XL Pickle Brined Crispy Chicken- chicken bites battered crispy, swapped out the fries for tots. Dipping sauces were tasty especially the rosemary lemon aioli. Chimichurri Steak and Frites- medium rare steak bites, very tender with tasty sauce, garlic shoestring fries. We will return next time in Vegas.",

She said it would be 20 min to sit inside, so we chose a seat inside the bar.  We noticed three other couple walk up and were immediately sat side. Waiting on the waitress took her 10 minutes to come over, even though there was only two other couples in the bar.  We waited 25 minutes for some extra cold food.  We sent half of it back, that's how cold it was.  On the other plates the hash browns were cold, as was the toast.  Not good at all.  The other couple next to us just walked out after complaining about their food.  Wouldn't recommend this place unless you enjoy horrible service and cold bland food.",

The meat was excellent and it comes with a thick gravy to dip in. Wish they had gone a little less crazy on buttering the bread, but that didn't slow me down much.   Normal and sweet potato fries come with specialty ketchups that are pretty fantastic. Makes a good appetizer or comes with sandwiches  Ordered a side of street corn too which was also excellent. Not quite velvet taco, but definitely worth ordering.  The grilled cheese is super rich but pretty amazing if you want something a little more manageable in size.   Nachos looked pretty good, but it's a pile so I didn't get to try any.   Pizza looked pretty sad, soggy in the middle, but that was the only thing even remotely disappointing.  If I end up at the New York New York hotel again or maybe even the mgm grand next door, I would definitely come here again.",

We asked for the patio seating which was right on the strip.  Excellent for people watching while you partake. Greeted with huge, welcoming smiles we were shown our options for patio seating and were allowed to choose.  We chose the bar stool height table against the glass in the corner, perfect venue.  We ordered beer and wine to start and assist in the almost overwhelming menu.  Judy was our server (shout out to the I.E.) and she was helpful but not forceful.  She pointed out the most popular dishes and her personal favorites.  We started with the honey bbq wings. 6 Perfectly crispy wings, unfortunately over sauced.  It came with cole slaw, unfortunately under sauced. Sauce the slaw, de-sauce the wings! My 'Dirty Dog' IPA (7.1) had my eyes bigger than my stomach and I ordered the Cuban sandwich and my wife had the chicken tacos. The panini pressed sandwich was flavorful and bigger than most.  My wife ate two of her three tacos before announcing she was full.Another IPA and I was buzzed and stuffed. I took the second half of the sandwich with me.    Thank God we were in Vegas and didn't need to drive anywhere. Service- 5 stars Food- 4 stars Value- 4 stars",

My daughter had the pancake which was huge, ask for the kids portion and they will give you two pancakes at a discounted price.

He gave us honest recommendations and kept our party excited about the dining experience despite our jet lag! As for the actual food, it was a bit of a let down. Aside from the chicken lollipops the entrees lacked the meat promised in the dish. Taste is comparable to an Applebee's or Friday's. If I return I would try a sandwich or burger as I think that's what this restaurant would make best.",

It was 2 full size pieces of Argentinean style skirt steak, topped with a herb chimichurri sauce and garlic fries.  Honestly, it's enough for two people to share.  I also had the pomegranite/lime iced tea which was yummy.  They have flat screen TV's all around. You can access the restaurant from the strip or inside New York New York Hotel/Casino.

Looked up nearby places and chose Tom's Urban because of the 4 star review and 2 dollar signs. I disagree with both those evaluations. $18 for nachos with flimsy salty chips and hardly any cheese or meat and just bad quality ingredients overall. Server was very kind and had the nachos taken off the bill. Even so, paid $60 for 2 beers, 1 cocktail, and 2 items off the small plates menu (fries two ways and brussel sprouts) which were just okay and overpriced. My boyfriend felt sick immediately after eating here. Staff were the only highlight of this restaurant and were all friendly and attentive.",

    "text": "I have never had such a horrible experience at a restaurant in my entire existence. I go with a group of 8 girls to get lunch, and our server tells us she can give us the bottomless mimosas for $19 (which ends at 1) if she punches it in the system before 1 pm. So its 12:50 and she checks all our ID's and brings us the first round. Next thing we know, the manager walks over and tells us he can't accommodate that, after she's already charged us for it, and tells us he can bring us \"one more round to be nice\"... First off, none of us would have ordered mimosas in the first place if our server hadnt told us she would still serve us bottomless after 1 pm. So we talk to the manager again, he's completely unwilling to compromise with us and then after 15 minutes of arguing back and forth he agrees to give us two mimosas for the price of what one costs. They bring us back a round of 8 glasses of literal orange juice, thinking we wouldn't notice. As if the cheap ass manager couldn't just do one thing right. So a random bartender, Spencer, probably sees that this manager has half a brain and comes over with a bottle of champagne and fixes the problem immediately. THATS ALL WE WANTED. We just wanted what we paid for. On top of all of this, our food was cold, and everytime we asked for something, like napkins, they literally ignored our existence. One star is gracious for an experience like this. All in all, don't come to this establishment unless you're here for Spencer.",

In addition when my Reuben sandwich came out, it was barely warm. The person I was having lunch with asked for the $20 food special where you get a salad, entree, side, and dessert. When he ordered the chicken entree it clearly said \"original or spicy\" to which he said he wanted it original. So of course it comes out as spicy. When the waitress came over she said \"oh, did you not see that it said spicy?\" to which we reminded her we ordered it \"original\". She then said her and her manager didn't know it came as \"original\" despite it you know, being on the menu. But never fear! They weren't going to charge us for this plate.....but wanted to make sure we still were charged for the pop tart and salad as part of the \"deal\".  So thank you, I couldn't eat my entree but glad to make sure you got the salad and pop tart out of me. Third time is the charm and it's told me to never recommend this place to anyone again.",

    "text": "Last week, my daughter and I and several friends found ourselves in Las Vegas for my daughter's 21st birthday.  On our first night in town, we decided to enjoy a nice, shall we say expensive, meal at a restaurant that, for our purposes, shall remain nameless.  Although the food was delightful, the service was slow with a food drop mishap and the experience was subpar.  The next morning, we were walking along the Strip when we happened across Tom's Urban.  The decor was hip, fun, and inviting, so we decided to give it a try.  We made it just in time for breakfast, and immediately ordered an array of omelets, egg dishes and drinks.  The food was taking a bit longer than it should have, and, when it finally arrived, one plate was absent--mine.  I encouraged everyone at our table to eat, as their food would get cold.  Several minutes later, my food arrived, however, it was overcooked. (Oh no, here we go again!)  I immediately sent it back, and within 2 minutes, the manager came to our table.   This was when our experience changed completely.    The manager', Joanne, was kind, understanding and extremely accommodating.  She had a friendly personality and everyone at our table immediately fell in love with her.  She took charge of the situation, making sure the rest of the meal went smoothly, and voluntarily eliminated my meal from our check.  My food came out piping hot and cooked to perfection.  Everyone's meal was delicious and we were in excellent spirits by the time we took our last bites.  In speaking with Joanne, we raved about how great this experience was compared with the previous night, and how we were celebrating my daughter's 21st birthday.  Without hesitation, she asked what my daughter liked to drink, and brought out two delicious, generous Raspberry Lemon Drops for my daughter and me.  Joanne truly went above and beyond to ensure that our meal at Tom's Urban was the best we would have that weekend, which it was.  There is more to tell, but I will leave it at this and encourage you to head over to Tom's Urban and experience this place for yourself.",

We were pretty disappointed with it. We did have to wait a long time for these two items to be served, which wasn't really a big deal to us as we were just enjoying each others company but the waitress brought out two pork belly tacos, compliments if the chef, to apologize for the wait. We were pleasantly surprised! My husband said they were better than the meal he had ordered. overall, not a bad dining experience, but not a particularly memorable or outstanding one either.",

It also too over an hour to get our food. After waiting for our food, I was told they forgot to order my food. It took another 40 mins to get my order. Not to mention that we had 3 people who come down late and had ordered 5 mins after the rest of the group and it too there food 30 mins longer to come than the rest of the table. When our food did arrive, it was cold, as if it had been sitting in the window for awhile. When all 11 of us agreed we had a bad experience, I know they restaurant did something wrong.  The only reason I didn't give this place a 1 star was because the manager, Tim, did everything he could to make things right. The food also tasted good, albeit, cold. Ultimately, the damage had been done, but for the 2+ hours of miserable service, it was a relief to have Tim comp our meal. At least we left with a less of a sour taste in our mouth. I would love to recommend this place to friends and family, but after this experience, I just can't do that.",

The sauce was overpowering and you couldn't taste the actual wings. I ordered the Cleveland hot brown which was a pile of soggy meat covered in cheese. I don't know what the flavor was supposed to be but it was not to my taste. The garlic fries on the side tasted like eating a pure garlic clove. Gave this place 2 stars because the service was quick and our server felt bad I didn't like my food so she took it off the bill.",

    "text": "The only reason why I didn't give this a higher score really came down to customer service we went there around 11:30 on a Tuesday night for a late night snack. We checked out the menu it was really awesome good variety and we could sit on the patio which was right on the strip! The sweet potato fries and eggs were good milkshakes were also good but on the pricy side. The part that sucked was the wait and miscommunication among servers. We had a total of 3 servers. One apparently was cut and left without letting us know or anyone else I guess as we had to ask someone for our bill after a good half hour of watching server after server walk by us. It's to bad we would have loved to go back but it wasn't worth it when there are so many great restaurants with servers that go out of their way to help you.  Update Even though our experience in the restaurant was poor I appreciate that Mr.Winter contacted me personally via email and addressed my concerns. My husband and I will give Tom's Urban another go and hopefully we can really enjoy our experience, after all it is a pretty trendy little restaurant with a great location!",

We asked about happy hour, server LISA said it won't be until 11pm. Ok fine so we decided to let her know that we will think about it and she said she will be right back. Literally NO one was on this restaurant. We had our mind set and ready to order. We asked a gentleman to ask for our server because it was time to order. (11pm happy our time). We kept waiting hoping Lisa would come, but she was just standing with her Co worker at our eye site looking at us and not doing anything at all. It's past 15 minutes, no water, no service we all decided to just leave the place. Being LOCAL checking out this new place. That was a terrible service.. in which this is being in the strip, expectations of good customer service should be implemented. Therefore, we went to CPK next door and received phenomenal customer service from Austin.",

My wife ordered the pull pork sandwhich soaked in a tasty bbq sauce and topped with their homemade coleslaw, like every pull pork should be! For being a new restaurant, these guys got it going on!

We received our food and he never checked on us or asked how everything was. We got finished with a couple of our plates and we sat them on the chair next to us because we didnt have room on the table. Our server walked by numerous times and failed to stop and pick them up. We even saw a manager that was standing right next to our table. He seemed more content socializing and hugging all over the hostesses instead of making sure things were ok and that our dirty dishes which at this point were attracting flies were removed. When the server would ask if we were ok it was just passing by not coming by the table. He finally dropped our check and when he finally ran our card and brought it back he didnt even thank us. Overall TERRIBLE service and terrible management.",

Toms Urban has a sports bar vibe on the outer area of the restaurant and a classy indoor vibe on the inside (where you can bring your kids). Although they are on the pricier side, you pay for a good portion and a decent meal, unlike the surrounding overpriced and mediocre meals you might get at neighboring restaurants.  I ordered the lobster and shrimp Mac and cheese with a side of crispy Brussels sprouts and my boyfriend ordered the philly cheese steak dip with garlic fries. The food wasn't out of this world to the point where I would religiously tell my friends and family to visit, but it is among the better places to dine in, especially if you are a tourist.  There is adequate parking, but as I stated before, if you are staying in any of those hotels this restaurant is walking distance.  On the plus side, if you enjoy breakfast food they serve their breakfast all day. One of the options I was eyeing was the filet mignon steak and eggs, which I'm sure would be worth the money.",

    "text": "My friends and I are convinced that this restaurant paid for all of these 4 or 5 star Yelp reviews because our experience was abysmal.  We came here for brunch at 10:30AM on a Saturday and the place was pretty empty, which we were excited about because we thought that meant we'd be seated and would get our food pretty quickly, since we were pretty hangry. Uh, yeah, no. That couldn't have been farther from the truth.  Even though literally 2/3 of the restaurant was empty, we were told that they couldn't seat us until a half hour later. We then asked if we could just sit outside and the 'hostess' went, \"oh ok\", as if she forgot that that was an option. Since it was around 50 degrees, we asked if they could turn the heat lamps on so as not to freeze to death and got a snide remark from the hostess, \"yeah but you're gonna have to wait because we need to get someone from management to do it.\" So yeah, great service so far.  After waiting a good 10 min, our waitress finally arrived to take drink orders.   20 min later, still no heat. After giving up getting service from them, one of us just got up and turned it on.  30 min later, our drinks finally came, except for the tea that a bunch of people ordered, which apparently only came in flavors that the waitress assumed we wouldn't want, so she just decided for us that we wouldn't want it.  After the drinks came, we finally ordered our food and waited at least another 45 min to an hour for it to arrive. When it finally arrived, we were treated with burnt toast, over-cooked eggs, a lack of condiments, and more.  All in all, unless you want to spend a good 2-3 hours at a restaurant that delivers inedible food and terrible customer service, my friends and I definitely would not recommend this place.",

This is my new spot to drop in for amazingly filling foods. I came in with a group of hungry girlfriends, and we left stuffed and ready to lay by the pool. We started off with bellinis that were absolutely perfect to hydrate from the Vegas heat. For food starters we got a bunch of the small plates to share, and the duck wings were amazing! If you are unsure of duck you have to try them. The sauce is a perfect sticky stick to the duck sauce, and you have to eat the slaw with it. Absolutely yum! Brussels sprouts, fried pickles, and spicy edamame were equally as amazing. I highly recommend the fried pickles because they are the ones you want and expect- perfect crispness and not dry at all. Okay being 7 girls ready to eat we ate, but we couldn't conquer because the portions are absolutely huge! I had the lobster and shrimp Mac and cheese.... To Die For!!! It's baked, comes out in a skillet, and each bite will have seafood all the way till the end. One of the girls had the Hangover Slop, she said it's a must and didn't want to stop. I saw one of the girls having the eggs benedict and I was blown away at how huge the English muffins were. They could hold up to the thicker slices of ham on top!  Thank you Erron, Lina, and Carmen for the amazing customer service. You guys had the best recommendations. Lina was the sweetest for constantly refilling my water. It's so hot in Vegas and needed to rehydrate. Erron was our manager who came out to see how we were. Thank you being so kind and your awesome vibes.  Oh P.S. the homemade poptarts are a freaking must!!!!!  Coming back tomorrow... Or dinner...",

When we were ready to leave, the server gave me a Mimosa to-go, which was awesome! Fantastic place, I'd recommend to everyone!",

This place is only open because of their location. We arrived and were seated in a corner.....we waited patiently for about 15 minutes and NO ONE came to our table....finally after waiting I decided to go see if they over looked us...they did! An Asian girl with leopard print sweater approached me and said let me help you!! Great! But alas the server came to the table next to us and had a great conversation for 5 more minutes and walked away! Yes the table sat 10 minutes after us got service!!!  This place is not worth your time money or energy. The food sucks and the service is even worse. Go somewhere else like Back stage Deli open 24 hours!",

With such a big menu and being very hungry I was surprised how long it look me to find something that sounded good to me.  I finally did though.  I got the buffalo chicken sliders and my date got the all American sliders.  She liked hers and I liked mine but there was nothing standout about them.  My fries were a bit flavorless though and definitely lukewarm.  The waiter was good and prompt and the meal definitely wasn't bad, it was just average, as the amount of stars given suggests.",

ARY was our wait person and he was very professional, attentive, and accommodating! The restaurant was rather busy and I feel as though we receive special attention. Kyle served our meals, which came in a timely manner, and he had a very happy disposition, a quick pace, and responded with a sense of urgency as he delivered food to each table! When we left the restaurant, after selecting our delicious desserts and carefully savoring them, we were very satisfied and quite happy with our wonderful experience at Tom's! ARY and Kyle, you made our day! Your excellent customer service skills are very much appreciated! Keep up the good work and will see you again, tonight at dinner!",

We ordered the philly cheese steak dip (French dip style, NOT a dip), lobster roll, Cuban sandwich, and lobster tacos. Philly is meaty and gravy dip is thick and hearty. Lobster roll has big fat pieces of lobster in it and bacon too!! The Cuban bread was super crispy and full of mustard-pork-pickle goodness. The three lobster tacos had tons of  lobster and shrimp in them. Skip the fries and order the tater tots, super crispy.",

It looked like street foods such as: burgers, tacos, wings, etc. My friend and I walked over and got a table immediately. It was pretty empty for a Friday night. When I saw the place, it looked like a big sports bar.   I ordered the mahi mahi taco, chicken adobo taco, and a muy thai. The chicken adobo taco blew me away. The chicken was so flavorful. Really captured the adobo like flavors. the mahi mahi taco was alright. It didn't have much tuna in it and the tuna was not that flavorful. Almost couldn't taste the fish. The muy thai was tasty. First time having one and it was stronger than I thought. I felt the alcohol afterwards haha.   My friend got the roasted brussel sprouts and potstickers. The potstickers were good, but nothing special. The brussel sprouts were fantastic though. They fried them and then put it in balsamic. I thought it tasted like a soy sauce base, but it was just balsamic. Best I've ever had. Also got a cheesecake with raspberry drizzle. It was so good! the cheese part was nice and creamy. It was not overly thick, which is good because it is huge.   Prices were not too bad for a place on the strip. This place has happy hour during many hours of the day. The earlier the time, the cheaper the food. It can get down to $4 an item (ie. a taco). Check it out! It's in New York New York.",

Food: the breakfast food was so good. I had the breakfast burrito and it was amazing. It was huge though.   Price: the pricing wasn't bad for a restaurant in Vegas. The portion sizes and price went very well together.   Drinks: I was pregnant at the time but they do have bottomless mimosas which I heard were really good. They do have your normal breakfast drinks like orange juice.   Atmosphere: the atmosphere is very lively since it is right on the strip. It was also laid back and seemed like a great place to just relaxed.  Service: The service was pretty good. We did have an issue with our appetizer coming out but we needed getting two appetizers out of it.  If you are looking for a place for breakfast where you can take in Vegas while eating, I would stop here.",

However, we ate at Tom's at least three times. The late night (after 11pm also available 2-5pm) menu is great, and was the key here because after eating an early dinner we usually were ready for another bite before the night was over. The potstickers and tots are good, the Mac is great and the sriracha buffalo wings are AMAZING. On the regular menu the fried chicken and cornbread pancake is unbelievable, and while we didn't personally try the burgers some of our friends had good things to say about them. Aside from the great food the service was always amazing too. Friendly waitstaff and speedy service. Do yourself a favor and try this place if you're in Las Vegas.",

    "text": "Tom's Urban has been on my \"to-eat\" list for a while now. I like to play and stay every so often at the New York New York Hotel & Casino and have walked pass this place way too many times. Just recently I decided let's end the procrastination! I arrived the other night just in time for Happy Hour! Score! On top of that there was no wait and we were seated right away! Our server was Eddie (I think that's his name) for the evening. He was great! There is nothing more that I appreciate than an attentive and honest server. When you are able to provide your own personal favorites on the menu as well as let the dining customers know what's not so good you get plenty cool points with me. Since I've never been there were two items I inquired about one being the full rack of ribs and the other the lobster roll. Both of these were explained to be \"just ok\" for taste. My theory is if I am going to pay extremely crazy prices for food I better be getting something damn delicious and well above \"just ok\". I finally made my mind up to eventually order the BBQ Bacon Jalapeno Burger Double Down Style which means double the meat and cheese! Score! With a side of sweet potato fries? Yeah I was in there like swimwear! Mouth just watered after ordering. To kill the immediate hunger me and my partner in crime decided to order the Hummus dip off the happy hour menu! If you are a hummus lover please do yourself a favor and get this to start! You won't regret it! When the burgers came out they looked amazing! My plate was just everything I thought it would be. The second burger that was ordered was the \"Sin City\" with a side of the garlic fries. Now I had to dock them a star on the fries on that plate because they were ridiculous! Cold! And you could tell they've been sitting. They lost even more points because when we brought it to our server's attention he took the plate of fries and returned within maybe 2 minutes? We are no fools I know that chef or whoever was in the kitchen just put those same fries in the hot grease and returned them to us. You can tell the difference between a fresh batch of fries or what was reheated..  After everything I still wanted desert and opted for their signature cheesecake with some raspberry sauce and whipped cream. To-go though because the burger was huge! All in all this was a pretty good visit and really enjoyed the burgers. I've heard brunch is great so I will be back to see what that's all about soon!",

The atmosphere is really cool, good music, plenty of tvs, and CLEAN. Growing up in the Midwest and living in the south for some time I was a bit skeptical because I like REAL mac-n-cheese. The mac-n-cheese was just a tad bit runny, just a little. It came with pick de gallo, pork green chilis, and green onions. The combination of different flavors wasn't bad at all. On a scale of 1-5 I give it a 4.4  I would recommend this place. Can't wait to try something different during my next visit.",

The shrimp salad was dry and had to ask for more dressing. The kitchen forgot how we ordered different entrees or maybe it was Brian the server. He was horrible. He  actually said to us that the kitchen sometimes modifies dishes but it depends how busy they were. We asked to modify the Cuban sandwich with no onions. He said he couldn't because the sandwich was made the day before and everything was already inside - gross .....glad I didn't have an allergy. Then I asked for a plain cheese pizza for a child. He delivered a margarita pizza. Not the same especially with all the green stuff on top and garlic. Needless to say all of us were done eating by the time the 7 year old got this plain cheese pizza. No apology, no refund. Managers were never around. No one stopped by our table. Stay away of you can. Too many good restaurants in Vegas to choose from. Plus we booked thru open table. I didn't get credit for the dine. Put in a special occasion of a birthday and nothing was recognized. We booked reservations at 4:30pm for a 6:45pm dinner. The place was empty..... we should of known ...........",

Nick and Haley we not friendly and seemed to act in a discriminatory way with myself and my friend. I guess the both of them didn't expect us to tip because we are African Americans but me being a fellow server I understand the business and believe in showing other servers respect with a nice tip. I still tippped the 20% even tho the service and food was not great. Nick and Haley have a lot to learn. They were both rude and stand offish and only entertained us once they saw how much we tipped... sad! They were so nice to all the white folks at the bar tho... gotta give it to them... they were consistent about that. This was my 2nd and last time going, but the first time didn't even quite happen because the bartenders from the day before took 45 minutes to bring us our order that never came and all we ordered was an omelette. My friend and I ended up leaving hungry. We got better service at Hells Kitchen and the food was great!!!",

I didn't realize that in the world of bloody Marys, you now have to specify if you actually want it spicy. As a result, ours was a bit bland, so we tried to spice it up with some table condiments. Our server checked on us, and we told him it was kind of blah, so he offered to take it back to the bartender. He actually returned with the same glass; half doctored-up by us, and half doctored-up by the bartender, and it was awful! Strange method for fixing up a broken cocktail. I'd expect a bit more care and quality from a bartender.  Also, the service here really took quite a while. Four cocktails and two appetizers for four people took us easily over an hour. We waited quite a while for our check, too.",

The fries had really good taste with the garlic and butter. To top it off the ketchup salsa was on point with the fries.

BUT my server Annie was beyond rude, never smiled once, didn't help with the menu when i stated i had never been here before. When i asked for no ketchup on my burger she acted like i asked for a crazy request.  I definitely felt like a burden, felt uncomfortable the whole time. Super awkward. Was extremely rushed by her, all she wanted was my signed receipt so she can get her tip. she did not care to give any remotely good service. She basically ran back to collect my signed receipt the moment my pen left the paper!! lol I even apologized (since she was obviously miserable) she didn't even look me in the eye and said \"its ok!\" with an attitude. I shouldn't be the one apologizing for HER horrible manners. I live in Vegas.... next time my friends visit from out of state i will not be taking them here due to the service alone. It ruined the whole night out. Food was really good though....",

It took forever for her to finally bring out waters and coffee -- almost as long as our meal, and then she forgot to bring out cream/sugar and we were almost done our meals by the time we were able to flag her down. We didn't have utensils -- which seemed to be happening to several other customers --  and since our waitress was nowhere to be found, I had to go find another waitress. I politely asked for utensils and she barely even acknowledged me and had an annoyed look on her face. I could maybe understand this type of service if the restaurant was really busy and understaffed, but it didn't appear that way.  After eating, we noticed that the container on our table that held our utensils had some disgusting, dried up fries stuck to the bottom of it. So we realized we had ate off of the forks that were placed on top of that.  There were birds flying around inside the restaurant, and eating off of the floor, which I didn't really mind since it was kind of entertaining, but I'm sure other customers weren't as happy when they were flapping above their tables.  Overall, would probably be 4 stars with better service and cleanliness, because the food was good and decently priced for The Strip.",

    "text": "Man, good reviews and the place looked nice but what a disappointment.   First the place was basically empty and yet they had a 20 min wait. No problem, I know how that works, I worked in a restaurant for years. Understaffed on a Sunday morning NBD. Then we get seated at the bar, cool we're in Vegas and I'm gonna want an Irish coffee, sounds great to me! The bar tender has the whole area to himself but there weren't that many people there so I figured it shouldn't be too bad but I guess I was wrong.   We ordered two waters and two Irish coffees. He forgot the waters but serves the Irish coffees. I try to get his attention but it was near impossible. Maybe this guy was new? I'm not sure but he took forever to do everything. It was taking about 10 minutes to get his attention and I really needed some water before diving into my Irish coffee since I had a slight headache (probably from being dehydrated) so I leave the bar and walk to the deli to buy a bottle of water.   Then it took at least another 10 minutes to get our order taken and he was putting the order in right in front of us as we were telling him our order. After 35 minutes of waiting for our food we realized it's probably not a back up in the kitchen that's taking it so long... so we ask the bar tender (again, took forever to get his attention) to check on our food. He comes back and doesn't even say anything to us first but looks in the computer. Ya know... I was a server before, I know the \"oh shit I didn't put it in\" look and that's ok, that stuff happens. But that only happened when I was hammered with too many tables which this guy did not have.   By this point I was done with this bartender whom I had so much patience with up until that point. While waiting for our food another table had sat down and was ignored so long that they got up and left. Another table also sat down and while the bartender started to put their order into the computer they left too. It was just so bizarre that he didn't have that many tables and he didn't have that many drink orders to make for the rest of the restaurant yet everything was taking forever and he didn't seem to be in a rush at all. His demeanor was very sluggish for a bartender.   Anyway after looking in the computer he looks up at us and says \"I don't know what happened but the kitchen doesn't have the ticket, can you tell me your order again.\" So either he forgot to press \"send order\" or the kitchen dropped the ticket somewhere. Either way, at that point of waiting approximately 40 minutes for food the manager needs to get involved and something should be given up, free app or like 10% off the bill. Doesn't matter what it is as long as SOMETHING is given. This guy doesn't even think to ask and that's when I realized he's just naturally bad at this job.   I would have asked for a manager but we were so hungry that we were fed up and didn't want to wait any longer. I asked for the bill and for two Irish coffee's it was $22. WHAT A RIP OFF.   We went to a crepe place right across from them and had food within 3 minutes and it was DELICIOUS.   The next time we're in Vegas I think we'll try this place again, but we definitely won't sit at the bar. I hate to judge a place after only one visit, and we didn't even try the food, so we'll be back. Hopefully the second time will be much better!",

I would say 3/4th of the restaurant was full so not a large rush or anything.  I ordered a caesar salad and a \"french dip sandwich.\" The server was confused because what I meant was the \"PRIME RIB PHILLY CHEESESTEAK DIP\" so she asked me to clarify if i wanted the dip with the salad and I said \"I want the sandwich as one order and the salad as a separate order. 45 minutes later she brings everyone their food and I get my salad and a side of au jus.... no sandwich. I asked the waitress where the sandwich was and she said \"oh I thought you just wanted the dip part\" ... why would i just want the dip part? I asked her to bring some extra dressing and the sandwich itself. Another 30 min later she finally brings out the sandwich after all my friends had finished eating and no extra dressing. Food here is really good, i recommend getting it to-go.",

Prices as high, as expected on the Vegas Strip, but that could be overlooked if the food is outstanding or at least good.  I ordered the chopped salad.  Wanted it without bacon and ham (also has chicken) and was told they could not leave the ham out.  Weird, but I said okay - figured I could pick it out.  Chicken in the salad was nit grilled as stated and was very salty and processed tasting.  I am sure it was some kind of packaged pre-cooked chicken which I really hate.  I also felt that my salad was missing some other ingredients so I checked on-line later that night and I was right.  They left out the romaine, baby kale and goat cheese.  I did not ask to have these items omitted.  The other entrees were pretty lackluster but I think they contained everything they were supposed to.  We all agreed that we would not return here.",

Finally, my friend went to the bar to go get us some waters. I then got up and approached one of the waitresses and asked her if she could help us locate our waiter. Her response was \"go talk to the hostess\". Annoyed, I then asked her if she could send a manager over. She turned around and continued serving her tables. Finally the hostess came over and I asked again to speak to the manager. The manager finally came over to our table and asked \"can I help you?\". I started explaining the situation and he cut me off before I could get one sentence out and asked what we were ordering. He was uninterested in our concern, did not apologize, and made some lame excuse like the hostess shouldn't have brought us there. Our food came out quickly, but they forgot a side salad that we ordered and the food was questionably not warm. The manager never followed up at the end and clearly did not care about our concerns in the slightest. The horrible service and mediocre food is not worth stepping foot in this place.",

The service was horrible not to mention that the waitress didn't even make eye contact with us. I had questions in regards to the menu and she made a face like I was stupid. Just ignored my question and basically told me are you going to order or if I'll come back when your ready. When she came back with my drink the glass was covered in fingerprints and food stains. I notified the hostess which seems like she felt bad. It took our waitress 15 mins to come back with my drink. When our food came out she passed by us and just said enjoy without stopping at our table. I didn't have utensils to eat my salad. We had to ask for our waitress to come to our table and ask her for them. She was aren't they in the holder umm no.. so she grabbed some from the table behind without even looking and left them on our table. We over heard other ppl at another table complain as well. Management didn't do anything..the only person that felt bad was the greeting hostess. For the price and experience I wouldn't recommend and if u do decide to eat here its at your own risk.",

Sever removed one meal (the only one we commented on) from the bill and also poured a couple to go mimosas for the bottomless mimosas.  The Food:  Worst hash browns I have encountered.  They were undoubtedly reconstituted hash browns from a box or bag.  Many if not most breakfast joints serve these prefab potatoes and sometimes they can be decent, these were not!  I think this may be why they come with a slice of cheese melted on top, an attempt to cover the sin of botching these so badly.  The Huevos Benedicto was ok if it weren't for being cold.  It was removed from our bill.  Gigante Breakfast Cubano was the best thing we ordered, nicely grilled sourdough with a lot of ham, cheese, carnitas (I assume roasted pork shoulder), a couple eggs, pickles and mustard also the hash browns, which covered in swiss cheese and eggs and layered between the meats didn't stand out as much as when they were dried out on the side of a plate.",

    "text": "My wife and I decided to try a meal here because there was an intriguing happy hour concept. During certain hours, the prices of drinks and food would vary, from lowest prices about 4 pm, and higher prices into the evening. We got there about 6 pm, when the price for a selected menu was $6 each item, and the price of a drink was $7. These were supposed to be happy hour, or discounted, prices. The regular price for a draft of domestic beer was $7. I assumed the happy hour price would be less than $7, so I ordered 2 Buds. The price turned out to be $7 each. No discount at all. On the food menu, the regular price for the steak street tacos was $18, The price for the happy hour was $6. That looked like a good deal, so I ordered it. Several minutes later, the server brought out a corn tortilla, about the size of a small bagel. On it was a tiny amount of cheese, and a little spoonful of meat. I asked the waitress if this was the regular price, and she said the regular price of $18 was for three of these minuscule servings.  I pointed out that each would then be $6, which was the happy hour price. In other words, for the happy hour you get one taco for $6, but the regular price was 3 for $18, which is $6. So, the beer and the taco were exactly the same price for the happy hour and the regular menu. Very Deceptive. My advice - before ordering at this restaurant, be very careful. They really offer no happy hour deals. By the way, the taco was OK, but not worth $6. I would say a fair price for the tiny bite is 50 cents.",

It was very good, just flat out a good burrito.  For dessert I had three things with my group. We had the cheesecake, excellent crust and a good taste throughout, also the pineapple upside down cake was very good as well.  Finally on a hunch I order pop tarts which are not on the dessert menu.  All I can say is that you have to try them, very unique and very good.  Overall a great experience, I will be back!!!",

Although our experience did not entail too much (we had a spiked shake and a couple beers) it was a very pleasant one.  The atmosphere here is pretty relaxed and the design and architecture kept the eyes busy.  The setup is actually quite ingenious to me as it flows very seamlessly from inside to outside.    The staff was very helpful and accommodating.  The hostess working that day was able to answer our questions with a smile and the bartender was personable and efficient.   Not a bad place to stop in and get a couple drinks and from the looks of the food probably more.  It was unfortunate that we had already eaten.",

As I stated before eggs were over cooked. Hollandaise was minimal not very tasty. English muffin was too dry to eat as eggs didn't run and lack of sauce. Best part was the \"hash brown \" which is really shredded potato in a pan with melted cheese. Not very warm. Server didn't ask questions when the eggs and muffin were left on my plate and I said \"I'm done with what I can eat\". She did ask if we needed anything but it was before I had tried my eggs. Needless to say we won't be back. Oh yea there were a few black flies and a few birds.",

I could talk about the rude hostess, the long wait, or the vanishing server but I think I will focus on the food.   The food itself is about the same quality as a Denny's. We started with a pizza as an appetizer, and it tasted like something purchased in the frozen food aisle and warmed up in a microwave. I expect food to be overpriced in Vegas, but at the very least it should taste good.  We should have known better after the pizza experience, but we gave them the benefit of the doubt and proceeded to order the street tacos. They were miniature, cold, and barely edible. Quite honestly, these tacos were insulting to tacos everywhere.  After realizing how awful the food was, we went next door to Shake Shack. After our experience at Tom's Urban, Shake Shack tasted like heaven.  I have never felt the need to write a Yelp review until my meal at Tom's Urban. I'm trying really hard to think of one positive thing to say...but I am drawing a blank. If you want to stay open in a city with so many great restaurants, you'll have to do better.",

The sauce that comes with the Brussel Sprouts was delicious but I preferred to eat the Potstickers without the sauce.

Some of my favorite words like \"aioli\", \"brunch\" and \"tacos\". We ended up ordering the lobster shrimp tacos which were great because you cannot go wrong. Would have loved some crazy sauce on there but I'm not complaining. We also ordered the fried pickles: great sauce and fresh tasting pickles (also ended up getting for free because of great yelp check in offers!) and the dumplings: very tasty but kind of crunchy on the edges, not exactly what I expect in dumplings. Over all good food, but minor rooms for improvement.   Accompanied my dinner with a kiwi margarita and an atomic duck IPA, always my go to duo.   Service was fast, attentive and consistent. Not a necessarily personable waiter, but that's nit picky. He took care of everything quite professionally.  The place is pretty cool, overall nice atmosphere supported by great food choices. Was not necessarily wowed by anything in particular but the place got the job done well and left no room for complaint.",

We were one table out of 5 others that were currently filled in the restaurant. It took about 10 minutes for our waitress to come over and take our order. It took another 10 minutes for my husband to get his bloody mary. We waited over 30 minutes to get our food. My hashbrowns were very cold and seemed to be stale.  As the restaurant became busier, we noticed that people who arrived after us had already received their checks while we sat waiting. The entire experience dragged on for over an hour when it could've been 40 minutes max.  One other note is the price of their food here. I know it's Vegas, however I find it to be very expensive for a bacon, egg and cheese sandwich (their BLT breakfast sandwich) to be 16 dollars.  You'd save time and money by choosing a different restaurant.",

The only real complaints I have is they have tables right next to each other so it's super easy to eavesdrop on others weird conversations. It was uncomfortable having a conversation or even hearing the tables around you bickering. Especially if you're not busy spread us out.  The server was fast and friendly it was perfect for a late late late dinner.",

We got the Mac n cheese, loaded tots, & chicken pot stickers. Oh, and for checking in we got FREE Brussels sprouts! The Mac n cheese was not what I expected but none the less it was pretty damn tasty! The loaded tots weren't very \"loaded\" but still I think I love them. The pot stickers were good, not really my thing but my husband wouldn't stop talking about them so they must've but delish! The Brussels were also not what I was expecting bravura nobody does them right.... but not Tom's Urban! They got them right! Get these! Super fresh and al dente'. My only regret is that I didn't order these from the get. So freaking good! Our server Judy is on top of her game as well. What I truly appreciate is a server who not only checks in on you throughout your visit but comes by before HH end to make sure you don't miss out on the specials! Yes! She was awesome!",

    "text": "Perfect spot to recap your vegas night out with your friends. Grab a patio table, order a bloody Mary & enjoy some perfect bar food while reminiscing about last nights events.   Located at a prime spot street view outside the NYNY its draws you and with its unique entrees you become curious.  Enjoyed an evening dinner here after stumbling upon it while walking around started with a drink. I started with the peach Cosmo which was a bit disappointing because it tasted more like lemon than peach. It wasn't too sweet though so that was a plus. Next the Bellini, not a drink I would ever order again. Its usually made with champagne but they use sparkling white wine. It was way too sweet for me to finish. Lastly the gin and juice was awesome, the muddled strawberries and cucumbers were a great added touch.   The pork rib sliders served with fried onion rings came out and looked pretty cool. Truffle oil, arugula and mushroom pizza was good! Lots of truffle oil, yummy! Cripsy brussel sprouts. Must try!!   Definitely recommend sitting on the patio if its not too hot.  I see this place more for a group gathering and catch up spot with friends, not so much a romantic or date night.   Service was average at best. A manager stopped by and checked on us but our server was not so easy to locate at time. Nonetheless, the service was average.",

The food is very good and some of the entrees were fabulous, particularly the prime rib sandwich and the club.  Will definitely try and return.

However, after a long week, a friend and I wanted to get breakfast and mimosa-wasted-on-a-budget, so we decided to try this place out.  Tom's Urban is surprisingly large and Pinterest-looking. With its aqua and persimmon-colored orb lighting dotting the ceiling coupled with its wooden rustic paneling, it looks straight out of something from Austin, TX...I dig it.   For $18, you get bottomless mimosas, provided you get there somewhat early (the cut-off time for this deal is 1pm) I had the Classic Eggs Benedict ($13) and my friend got the Lemon Poppyseed Blueberry pancakes ($10). We split our entrees and had a good combo of savory and sweet. I have to say the pancakes were amazing! My eggs benedict looked like it was sitting under the heat lamp for longer than expected (see picture), but it was still good.  Our waitress was friendly. It took awhile for the first set of mimosas to come out, but after that, they seem to keep coming. By the time we paid the check, we were both nursing bad champagne headaches. Actually, the menu states they use sparkling wine, so I'm not sure if that contributed to the intensity. Nonetheless, we got what we came for! Overall, breakfast prices are decent, but I agree with other reviewers that their other foods run a little high.",

    "text": "Pros: Once we told the hostess we had a reservation, we were seated quickly. We requested indoors, rather than outdoors (it was windy & hot) and they were accommodating. The food was good. I loved the Nashville Hot Chicken; but even more than that, I loved the cornmeal pancake that was underneath the chicken. It was a large portion, so you could easily take half to-go.   Cons: People without a reservation were being turned away, and even though we had a reservation, we had to wait in a line 12 people deep at the hostess stand in order to be seated. Our waiter was not good. I ordered a mocha (it's on the menu) and he said back to me, \"A what?\" I said, \"A mocha.\" He said, \"What is that? I guess I could get you one, but our machine we use to make them is broken.\" I said, \"I guess I can't order one then, right?\" How was he thinking he was going to get one for me if the machine was broken and he didn't even seem to know what a mocha is? It was a weird interaction. He was also extremely slow to bring our check. We asked for it, because we were going to a concert after we finished eating -- which he knew, because we had told him -- and it still took him at least 15 minutes to bring our check. There are other places with similar food and better service. It's also a personal annoyance of mine when a place serves Pepsi (which I despise) and they don't also offer Dr. Pepper.",

We can handle lukewarm coffee but Luke warm eggs Benedict??? An assault on my taste buds, wallet and time. Skip it unless you are in a budget, but even then... just skip it. Sorry Tom, middle class deserves better!",

We came in tonight, Tuesday, before game 4 and met up with 3 other people at the round tables right next to the bar. We were NEVER greeted by our server. Apparently our friend sat at these tables for 10 minutes with no service so he went to the bar to get a beer. The server saw that and came over to yell at him for going to the bartender and not ordering from her. He apologized he wasn't sure who to go to since he was never helped. We came in and sat at the table for 25 minutes with ZERO help. We finally went to the bar and asked Andrea if she was able to help us. She was slammed at the bar and still made time to help us out. She apologized for no one helping us and took great care of us. I will be back, but only to sit at the bar. Thank you, Andrea, for turning our experience around and still taking care of us even though we were not in your section.",

The waiter seemed kinda chill at first, chatting with us but after the initial conversation he disappeared a lot, and it wasn't that busy. The calamari we ordered was amazing but that was the only good thing about our meal. I ordered the carnitas Cuban and in the description it says there's supposed to be pickles on it but half of the sandwich did not have pickles and the carnitas lacked flavor. My boyfriend ordered the prime rib sliders, and they were messy and flavorless as well. The French fries he ordered were very oily. Overall we spent close to $80 for sub-par food. Probably will not return to this restaurant ever again",

I had a drink called Gin and Juice (cucumbers, strawberries, gin, and splash of soda). It was honestly probably one of my favorite drinks ever. I had the Thai salmon as my entree. It came with plentiful veggies and a large filet, but the sauce was very spicy. Too spicy for my liking, as it made it not enjoyable to eat. The fish was cooked perfectly however, and it was still a delicious meal.   They serve breakfast all day, and this seemed to probably be the way to go. Apparently they make their own PopTarts!   It was chilly when we went, but the patio looks like a fun place to eat out on. They do have heating lamps, but it was a bit too chilly in November for us to brave it outside.  Overall, this is one of the most memorable meals i had in Vegas. Prices are a bit crazy, but it's Vegas...and unlike most of the restaurants you leave without feeling ripped off.",
