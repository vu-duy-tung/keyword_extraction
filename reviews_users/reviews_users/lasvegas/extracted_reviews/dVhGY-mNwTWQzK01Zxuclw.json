My pet peeve with this place is that the owner of this restaurant keeps all the tips, not the waitress.  One of the owner, the older lady works as cashier/waitree is the one takes all the tips. I think she is also the wife to one of the owners. That is why you don't see her do too much work.  I learned this after I went to eat with one of my friend, and she knows one of the former waitress that used to work there.  That is why you would get substandard service there, and what the restaurant is doing is deceiving to the customers.",

A  small hard to find hole in the wall place in China Town in Las Vegas but if you are willing to look it is not a hole in the wall and not that hard to find!  The decor is nice neat and the service is competent and polite for hard core China Town.  I don't mind having a fake smile greeting for great authentic food.  This is one of the places  I find it...  This is authentic Northern Chinese food so if you do not like spice please avoid because most of it is hot hot hot.  However if you like heat and you know the difference between Hot and Burn your face off, hot v/s spice is the question.  This place uses chillies, peppers, veggies and spice to create a perfect balance of flavor.  Don't get me wrong it is HOT but it also has flavor any HOT person will love this place I personally LOVE it as much as my stomach and intestines will allow it.  My father in-law whose glasses steamed up and sweat running off his face, also claimed he love hot but after clarified not hot but spice will disagree with me.    So, know your spice, and love every minute of this place!  We got the Spicy White Fish, some days it is very deep fried most days it is nicely deep fried The Cumin Lamb is our favorite.  I look forward to trying some veggies after reading other reviews asian veggies are my favorite and will forgo other options some days for the best veggies!  Can't wait to come back...",

I have never had better tofu-based dishes, loaded up with fresh Chinese greens, garlic, pea nuts, onions and chile flakes.  Just an intense flavor bomb.  Better still, thin strips of pig's ear, the preferred source of porky goodness.  Do yourself a favor and dive deep here.  The seven dishes we had were a miracle in highlighting the nuanced joy of eating this cuisine.",

This cuisine is effing delicious and little havens like this restaurant just aren't too many places.  Not only are they rare, but to experience the food well you really need to be open to new experiences and have someone there who speaks Chinese. It's hard to thrive otherwise.  Anyways, what kind of food can you expect? Well ... let your Chinese friend handle it or go with anything with noodles (they're made in-house) and order some of the cold plates at the counter to start.  My absolute favorite dish was the Szechuan style spicy fish soup. Get some rice to eat with it and you have some TASTY stuff. Order this even if your Chinese friend doesn't want to.  If you're in Vegas for vacay you'll probably be busy with restaurants on the strip. But if you want something different then come here.",

FOOD: Chinese restaurants in Vegas are either unauthentic, too salty, or leave a bad taste in my mouth. Yun Nan is authentic and will kick your butt with flavor. There is so much to choose from; the menu is huge! I haven't had the opportunity to try more than a few dishes. The Noodle dishes I could live without.... but their Mapo Tofu is the best in town and their white fish seafood dishes are ALL delicious.  SERVICE: The service isn't bad. Its just hard to communicate with the waitresses. They don't speak a lot of English. If you can't speak Mandarin... just order using the numbers.   CREDIT CARDS: Minimum $20",

I'm with  my family and my brother so we walk into this place and it is packed and we are the only non-asian people in the place (I took that as a good sign).  Anyhow when I asked for crispy noodles the waitress looked at me like I was from Mars.  The Chinese lady in the table next to me came to my rescue when she overheard me and knew what I was talking about and began explaining to the waitress what I wanted in Chinese.  She quickly smiled and looked at me and said they don't serve crispy noodles here, at least not the type you are thinking of.    I'm thinking boy I must look like your typical American moron, so I quietly began looking at the menu for dishes that looked familiar.  I settled for a scallions and onions, a kungpao plate, some of the speciality fried rice, a noodle bowl with some of the more exotic meats like stomach, and a couple of other dishes that were recommended by our neighbor friend.   I must say I have never eaten such good food.  All of the dishes were amazing. It was one of the most enjoyable and best tasting meals I have had in a long time.  I wasn't the only one in our group that felt that way.  We all raved about how good it was.  I don't think we left a crumb of food on any of the plates.  I can't say enough about how good this place is and how much better authentic Chinese food tastes in comparison to the American version we are used to being served in even fine places on the strip.  Just the night prior I had eaten a crispy noodle dish at the Aria casino which I thought was pretty decent but this place puts it to shame.    I will come back to eat at this place every single time I am Las Vegas.",

Of course I Yelped it, and this place came up with high marks.  Amazing menu with so many items you never see on the \"Americanized\" version of so many menus.  Don't worry, for those who love the same ol' standard, they have all those items as well, but there was frog, dried fish, whole fish, tripe, and all kinds of amazing sounding dishes I wanted to try.  I love the photo inserts of the house special dishes.  Although I really wanted to order 10 things, we decided on 2 dishes.  Spicy lamb with cumin which was phenomenal!  And guess what?......it was SPICY!!!!  Thank you Yun Nan for making the dish how it's supposed to be and not downgrading the spice levels because of some fear to upset the obviously out of place diner!  I love it!  Also had shrimp with snow peas which was absolutely perfect!  Firm very fresh shrimp in a light sauce and wonderful fresh and crisp snow peas that barely hit the wok!  This is a great little spot and I will be here many times to come!  My new favorite Chinese restaurant in Las Vegas!",

Over here you'll find much better and like 3 times cheaper than what you'll find at the strip restaurants.  Do try the hot oil wontons, they are small, so an order for 1 is still ok. The beef noodle soup was good, beef had good texture, noodles were nice and chewy and crisp but soft. Lamb hot pot stew was good, but too much cumin in my opinion. The pan fried one was better. Sze Shrimp with peanuts was great. Always a crowd pleasure. One girl ate all the shrimp and left the peanuts!",

I've had this dish called Chongqing Spicy Chicken at Jugoo but now they no longer exist so what to do, what to do?!?!  Friend told me about this place because they have that exact dish BUT not the type of chicken I was expecting. It was deep fried or something and only decent at most. Disappointed with the chicken, but the dish is the same one, with all that influx of spices and such. A friend's mother says you're supposed to ask for the other type of chicken so I guess I could attempt that next time.  We only got two dishes. The one mentioned above and the Lamb with Cumin. YUMS. I would totally get that again and again. Of course, I'll probably try other dishes but that one is a plus. I'm not much of a spicy person cause it just tortures me but it's still so damn good.",

We tried the stir fried Eel with dry pepper....the eel was very flavorful and the dish was spicy!  It had a nice consistency and tons and tons of taste going on!  The portion was huge and they did not skimp out on the goods!   Check out the pic :  <a href=\"http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/yun-nan-garden-las-vegas?userid=eZZyuJDouIg4p-GYB3PV_A#roxUo3o8u3yg7px8D7wgaw\">yelp.com/biz_photos/yun-...</a>  Had the salt and pepper shrimp, and it was good, just thought it would be full head on and done a little differently.  Also thought they would/should have been larger at $12-13 for the plate.  I wouldn't order these again, unless I can specify that I want head/shell on.  Pic :  <a href=\"http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/yun-nan-garden-las-vegas?userid=eZZyuJDouIg4p-GYB3PV_A#7M6BnswF5BV-esTvISeL8g\">yelp.com/biz_photos/yun-...</a>  Lastly, tried some fried egg and green onion dish.  It was light and flavorful.  Wanted something that wasn't spicy, and this filled in well.  Also a generous portion and inexpensive.  Service is typical authentic Asian.  Just friendly wave if you need anything and you will get it fast....just don't expect service like you would in an American establishment (auto/fill drinks, check on food, getting bill etc), and you will have a great time.  I WILL be back again.  Even their non spicy dishes are packed with taste, and blow away any other spots I have tried in town thus far (Chinese food wise).",

I started with a delicious noodle beef soup. Although this was more than a bowl full, the flavour coming out of the kitchen prompted me to take a second course. I decided on Szechuan stir fried beef with steamed rice. Although not marked as spicy it certainly was! Having said that it was nicely spicy. Perhaps the best chinese food I've had for a long time. Being the only non chinese in the restaurant I think that I'm not the only one who likes this restaurant.",

    "text": "Leave it to a bunch of millennial hipsters to give an authentic Chinese Szechuan cuisine 3.5 stars huehuehue.  Let give you a bottom line of why Yunnan Garden is so amazing. It's simply because they produce rare quality flavors you wouldn't find elsewhere in Vegas. That and while having existent service. I don't think Yelpers understand how rare service + authentic Chinese food is.   My experience: A couple of my Chinese friends suggested this place after having a few drinks. My only experience with Szechuan at this point is an Americanized greased out joint I used to go to in college for some cheap Chinese food. I agreed since I love spicy food and I wasn't picturing the flavors to be that much different. When I first stepped foot into Yunnan Garden, I knew I was in the right place because I couldn't understand a word anyone was saying. Facilities were very clean for such an authentic Chinese restaurant too. We placed our order and asked for very spicy. The service was very kind. The waitress made effort to converse with us with her broken English, which just shows that they're up to do their jobs even in uncomfortable situations.  Our food arrives to our table at a reasonable time. After having Americanized Szechuan food, I would have never imagined Szechuan to be so aromatic. The spice your tongue feels isn't the typical bitey-vinegary spice either. The best way I can describe the spice is that your mouth feels like it's under anesthetics (weird, but it was the best I could do.) According to my friends, this is THE place to go for authentic Szechuan food and I must agree.  Overall, Yunnan Garden nails it with spectacular food, good service, and clean amenities.",

Don't know about you, but for me that's a pretty good sign for a chinese restaurant.  I filed the place in the back of my mind as a place to try and then of course forgot about it.  Fast forward a few months and our neighbours told us they wanted to take us to one of their favourite restaurant.  And then we pulled up here.  How exciting I get to try the place finally!  We had the kung pao chicken, garlic vegetables, wontons, and fried rice.  Starters were around $7.99 and entrees averaged about $14.99 so they aren't your dirt cheap asian joint, but everything was excellent.  There were four of us and we were well full by the end.  Food came out quickly, everything was extremely flavourful and well prepared.  I've had my fair share of mediocre chinese food and this definitely wasn't it.  Very authentic.  I would definitely return.",

If you truly enjoy Szechuan food with some spice I would recommend these two dishes. The portion sizes are huge so there are always left overs, which is great if you have a place to store them. There is also great value in this meal because of the portion size and the dollar size. All in all a great place to try some authentic Asian cuisines!",

I was served hot tea and my order came in a reasonable time.  The chicken was cooked in a crunchy manner and it had a lot of red chili pepers (which I like) but I found the food way too dry and salty.  I asked the waiter if I could order some sauce to put on my food (and rice) and was told No.  I said the rice and chicken was rather dry and I would like to ordrer some sauce, any sauce, to top my order.  He brought me 3 packages of Soy Sauce.  I said the table already had soy sauce, vinagar sauce, and chili paste on the table, what I wanted was some sauce like a gravey to top my food and he said, \"No Sauce\".  I bagged my food and left.  I didn't feel the service was even close to adaquate.  I was under the impression that the place you eat at should accomadate your taste and wishes, I was eager to pay for some sort of sauce (gravey like) to top my dish and do not feel there was any attempt to accomadate my wishes.  From this experience, I will not probably ever eat there again.  All the other dishes that customers odered looked good and looked like authentic Chinese food.  I wanted this experience to be good, as I heard a lot of good things about this resturant, but I have  nothing good to say about my dining experience there on this occassion.",

The moist ham-like pork is very tasty and I definitely recommend it.  The beef stew noodle soup has some nice heat and is great comfort food.  The cumin lamb is the spiciest dish I've tried.  Also the saltiest, but still great.  The service is acceptable.  The staff was friendly, but the english was pretty limited so ordering involved some finger pointing at the menu.

The street is basically the rear parking lot to the main strip of restaurants and is easy to miss.      Get the cha chang mien, stir fried bean curd, shredded pork in brown sauce (comes served atop a bed of cabbage), and the house special noodles and soup (item #1).  The chicken was gamy so I tossed it aside, but the broth was light and just right.  Everything else had me thinking I'd be back for another nice meal.   Other reviewers were on the mark about the level of oil the restaurant uses on some dishes but it was tolerable.   More authentic and out of the ordinary if you're willing to try a different menu. You won't find sweet and sour pork or walnut prawns here if you're craving Chinese Am.  But what a pleasant alternative in the middle of nowhere.",

NO Guandonghua spoken here! Loud, busy,crowded and energetic with AWESOME food that will knock you on your ass. Go ahead and WHINE about how its too small, its not easy to find on a main drag, you have to wait too long for a table, the decor isn't fetching enough or the menus  are mostly in CHINESE; blah, blah, blah. WHO CARES? The FOOD here is the main event (isn't that why you go out to eat at restaurants in the first place?, DUH!) and WHAT an EVENT it is! Yeah, it's spicy with lots of chili and chili oil...but its all FRESH: the MOST authentic and creative Chinese food I have expereinced anywhere outside of Mainland China. On top of everything else...it's ONE HECK OF A DEAL: our dining party of six ordered two appetizers from the cold counter, 10 main dishes and two rice plates. The total tab was still LESS than $100. For the uninitiated, certainly worth at least one trip to see how its done in the old country because if you have not yet experienced it, you won't understand.....It doesn't get any better than this...THE REAL DEAL!",

    "text": "It's hidden behind Chinatown, as it is hard to find. We ordered wontons, noodles, fried fish, and small lamb chops. The wontons were soaked in chili oil and salty, which I do not prefer. The noodles and fried fish were okay. The lamb chops were too hard and salty. This place lacks service because when we asked for boxes the server asked us, \"don't you think our service is good?\" while she packed our food. She didn't look happy, probably that we didn't give any tips. She left without even giving us a bag to put our boxes in. One of my good friend's friend opened this place, and she agrees with me that the food was better back then than it is now.",

The salty food is still good, but needs to be toned down with a lot of rice. The Yunnan noodle soup is OK, not amazing. Do try the cold appetizers! And if you like fresh greens, ask the server about the seasonal Chinese veggies which aren't on the menu.",

    "text": "Had to write an update and correction. This is neither a Sichuan nor a Szechuan restaurant as I had concluded earlier. A knowledgable friend pointed out that it is a Yunnan restaurant, featuring dishes from a province by the same name in southwestern China. The steam table that I mentioned earlier actually sells dishes typical of this region and the regulars actually order items from the steam table as appetizers along with the main dishes. Items on the steam table include duck heads, chicken feet, thinly sliced tendons, vegetables, thinly sliced pork, peanuts fried with what looked like white bait and shallots, etc, etc. What the regulars do is order items from the menu then walk over to the steam table and order items from the steam table in small plates to share. Another popular dish with the Chinese regulars is a noodle dish with a clear chicken broth accompanied by thinly sliced meats and vegetables on the side which one adds to the noodles. Almost every table would start off by sharing this noodle dish before going to the other dishes. We tried it and it is really good. There is a picture of it in the menu.",

It's very unfortunate to say that I finally have to say no to this restaurant!!! Made a reservation for dinner, party of 8 for my mom'a birthday. When we showed up the restaurant was full, and apparently they forgot about our reservation. We waited for almost 15 minutes, no one came to apologize for the mess up, and what really pissed me off and finally decided to walk out of the restaurant is when I told the the owner about what happened, he replied and said regardless if we made a reservation or not, they are too busy, if they don't have a table ready for us, we just have to wait! In my mind: \"&@&!/']\" this is definitely not the kind of reply to any guests at any restaurant!! How rude and  arrogant, not to mention I coordinate our company dinner at this restaurant once a month and spent over $300-$400 each time and the owner recognized who I am. Apparently this restaurant is careless for any customer service or loyalty guests!! There's a new Yun Nan restaurant at the 99 ranch plaza one block away, for those who also had experienced the \"customer service\", I heard this new place is not too bad, will check it out!",

    "text": "Oh, my....this is the kind of Chinese food I am crazy about.  The flavors are so intense and complex that I get full within a few bites.  I had Dan Dan noodles and a plate of their cold dish offerings from a converted salad bar setup.  I don't know exactly what the cold dishes were:  I think one was some kind of seaweed, one had edamame, chinese greens, cilantro and dried red peppers, one had big chunks of cucumber, one had fried or braised tofu slices, and one had pork ear (I asked because I like pork ear).  There were other things, but I wanted some green stuff to offset the noodles.  The plate of cold stuff costs an extra $4.50, but I got way more than my money's worth.  The Dan Dan noodles were thick and chewy, with a distinctive wheat taste, a rich, oily, spicy meat sauce that perfectly embodied ma-la flavors underneath, and chopped peanuts on top.  I'd had a very difficult time trying to choose a dish from the menu:  so many things looked good to me.  Sliced fish?  Preserved pork?  Lamb?  I'll have to go back again and again.  If you aren't used to spicy food, you might want to avoid some of the dishes marked as spicy on the menu.  Or maybe not, because you would be really missing out.  The atmosphere and decor are spartan/casual.  It doesn't matter.  The food is that good.",

Their flavor isn't exactly delicious, but they come amid a mountain of crazy-tasting bits of fried garlic with a strange carnival candy taste to them.  It's a fun dish, but I wouldn't order it again unless I wanted to show the novelty to a friend. The cumin beef, on the other hand, is a steel-toed boot full of flavor right up your tailbone.  I didn't realize anyone on earth would eat this much cumin... and it works!  It comes with tons of fresh cilantro, jalapenos, and garlic, and if you're a tough guy, you'll love it.  If not... go eat at Panda Express, you little sissy baby.",

The service was definitely lacking - I suppose maybe we insulted them by picking at our dishes instead of eating them.  In the end, we finally gave up.  \"Boxes?\" -- asked one of the servers.

The Yunnan rice noodle soup (#1 on the menu for $7.25) was delicious and not spicy or oily like some of the other spicy noodle soups. We were there twice during our stay in Vegas, and ordered the Yunnan rice noodle soup both times. We also enjoyed the appetizers where one would go to the front to order. The overall price was reasonable.   If you cannot take spicy food, be sure to tell the waitress, because what is mild to her maybe a bit spicy hot to you. Or simply stay away from any dish marked with a chilly pepper.   Yes, we will revisit this restaurant again if we go back to Vegas.",

In addition, she's from Wu Han which is accustom to spicy food.  She was all smiles and loved the speed of the service, taste of the dishes, and the spiciness levels.  Whew!  I was afraid she'd be bitching about eating American or Vietnamese food.  In any case, the food here is authentic.  Even the customers are from the mainland too.  The flavors are deep, oily, salty, and above all, spicy.  If you're looking for real Chinese food, this place is pretty close.  The service is real too, which is you gotta flag down the waitresses, be curt, and expect fast responses.  I took off one star for room for improvement.  Service could be more Americanized, more courteous, more structured.  Ahh, I guess Chinese will always be Chinese.",

But it is a good spicy as you can taste the flavors of the food, not just the spiciness.   I was kind of lost in the menu since I didn't know most of the dishes.  It is not your \"typical Chinese American food\".  If you are looking for typical Chinese American food, this is not the place for you.  However, if you like to try something new, I would highly recommend it.  I must confess that I don't remember what I ordered, but it was really good (and spicy).  The prices are reasonable.  Most dishes are around $10.  If you like spicy food, I would rate it a must try (10/10).  If you can handle some spicy food, it is worth a try (8/10).  If you don't like spicy food, go to Panda Express.  The service was good and the waitress was friendly.  She was very patient as we didn't know what to order, but she kept checking on us.  10/10.  Location The restaurant is located off the strip, but not too far away (maybe 1-2 miles).  If you have a car, its no problem.  If you don't it could be a problem.  The restaurant had a homely feel.  It is in a newer building, otherwise I would call it a hole in the wall restaurant.",

It looks new so I'm guessing they remodeled or changed owners recently.  The drawback is that this place is hard to find being located behind the main Chinatown plaza on the backside.  But it's worth looking for if you're in the mood for something different or wanting to spice it up.  The restaurant isn't huge and you most likely will be served by the lady in charge.  She speaks Mandarin and is pretty nice.  The menu is sectioned off and specials are recommended -- she can give you advice if needed.  It looks like this place was given ratings by local dining reviewers (newspaper articles on wall).  The Chinese cuisine is more northern style with more spices and hot peppers which kept people warm during cold winter nights.   We were able to try a handfull of dishes as our party consisted of 5.  We had a plain but fragrant taro soup, 'melts in your mouth' pumpkin squash dish, talapia fish, spicy eggplant & string beans, hot kumin lamb, and pickled long beans.  You can ask for spicy or non-spicy depending on your hot pepper tastes.  All dishes were great and we had plenty of food to go around.  It reminded me of some meals I had while in Asia.  Just thinking of coming back here to try other dishes makes me hungry again. good LV stuff!",

    "text": "I am sorry to pour on everyone's parade, but this place isn't all that.  This is the sister restaurant to the one in Monterey Park, CA.  Okay that is dead central Asian community, many may say this place can't compare and it's not bad for Vegas.  I am sorry I have to be fair and honest.  If you have been to the other restaurant then you will know that this place can NOT hold a candle.  For the full review and pics go to <a href=\"/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.kats9lives.com%2F2008%2F07%2Fsame-store-in-different-states-not-same.html&s=6d78a9d0b4cf0feb5387681da78702136fdb3069f4f6cfab5bee1c595227ec4f\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">kats9lives.com/2008/07/s...</a>  First off, this place is located in the most remote area.  It's back behind the more popular stores, away from the eyes of people.  There wasn't that many people there and when you go in you will see the people working there just sitting around chatting, which is fine.  We immediately went to get some small plate dishes.  My favorite at the one in Monterey Park is the \"Fu Chi Fei Pian\", which they had here.  It tasted somewhat similar but not quite.  Yes, it is spicy but it lacks real flavor.  My family really liked the Dan Dan Mien and they thought that was really good, but what I really wanted there was the Wontons in Chili Oil.  HUGE DISAPPOINTMENT! It was just pure chili oil and no flavor.  The one in Monterey Park is spicy and emanates flavor.  I didn't really care for the wontons either.  It really was just not that good.  I am glad we only came for an after dinner snack.  So disappointing after reading the rave reviews.  I was so excited to find out that this was the same chain as the one in Monterey Park.    Yelpers, you got my hopes up and really let me down.  My family is pretty Chinese and my sister LOVES spicy food, but none of us really liked this place.  I guess for Vegas you can settle?  But I don't believe that to be True because Vegas has tons of great restaurants.  This place just doesn't measure up.  Sorry.",

The fish reminded me of a dish I experienced in Beijing and was tender, included napa cabbage@ and was tasty. The mapo tofu and shredded pork were just as yummy and the portions were decent.  The waitress who was younger and from northern China was friendly, spoke good English and had only been in the US for a few months. We had good conversation and she was efficient.

There were crowds of people waiting for a table in this intimate location, so we opted to do take-out. While Yunnan is known for their spicy dishes, we went ahead and ordered their non-spicy options - house special soup rice noodles, wontons, and a pork/veggie mix. We also ordered some of their cold appetizer dishes - I believe a box of whatever you wanted was $6 or so. The noodles were awesome and on a cold day the soup definitely warmed me up. Everything else was also pretty tasty and affordable, so I'll definitely be back again to update on the other offerings. :)",

We came on Christmas Eve since we were with our Chinese relatives from china and they much prefer Chinese food over American cuisine. Found this place with a quick search on yelp. There is ample parking and this is located adjacent to the Chinatown plaza. We had a party of 9 and was still seated right away. Let me just take a moment and add a fat shiny star for their extra speedy service. Have you been to jimmy johns before? This is seriously almost as quick as that but way more quality food. I swear this place gave me my dinner faster than any fast food places. I wouldn't say the service was good but the speed makes up for it.   As for the food, it is so good! Even my Chinese relatives said it taste like the food in china! Definitely not americanized. I loved the chicken feet and even bought some extra for later. I also really enjoyed the pickled sprouts, cucumber, mapo tofu, and spicy fish. My spicy chicken mi fen noodle was good and warm! Not too spicy and tasted so good with the other appetizers we ordered. I was very stuffed and we still took a lot of leftovers:) it was definitely one of those homey, satisfying meals! If you are in Vegas and craving a good, delicious and simple Chinese meal, this is the place to try! I enjoyed it more than those fancy American expensive dinners:)",

I have been meaning to try this place since I moved to Las Vegas a year and a half ago, but it wasn't until this past winter break did I actually get a chance to go.  My husband and I came at the end of the lunch rush on a Friday and were able to share a table with another party of four right away.  It didn't bother us, but it is just a heads up you are in a small group and it is busy.  There was a large extensive menu and we probably didn't order the most popular dishes, but they were delicious!    Mapo Tofu - Chunks of soft tofu surrounded by perfectly flavor sauce.  It is vegetarian friendly (not that I'm vegetarian, but I thought I'd share) and was everything that I wanted it to be.  It was marked as spicy, but I felt that it was pretty mild.  I might have felt this because the other dish we ordered was really spicy.  After I sample a couple of their other dishes, I'm sure I will order this again  Chongqing Spicy Chicken - Soooooo Good!! At first it is a little scary because the perfectly fried chicken pieces are surrounded with chunks of chilies, but it was amazing!  The batter was light and very well-seasoned.  This is spicy, but not in the \"OMG my mouth is on fire where is the water?\" kind of way, it is has the occasional bite that numbs your taste buds, but it comes back in a couple of minutes.  I know that doesn't sound appealing, but if you avoid those chilies it is so worth it!  I will without a doubt be back!  I can't wait to update my review when I get to try more dishes.",

They have a to-go looking stand to the left where they offer various cold salad appetizers. You can pick 3, for $4.5 I think is a good deal. We got braised tofu which was nicely spicy, a good but standard seaweed salad, and a sliced chicken gizzard salad which was nicely fragrant.   We got:   Spicy Chicken Dry Pot - they asked if we want with or without bone. Normally bone makes for better flavor so we opted, but it made for some work. They chopped up chicken wings and fried them crispy and tossed them into this pot with a chili sauce, jalapenos, bell pepper and bean sprouts. The flavors and textures were very nice, though I'll try boneless next time.   Fried Fish Filet tossed in spicy sauce was actually no sauce at all. it was more like salt and pepper fried fish, but better. It's the familiar flavor, but had also dried chilis, cilantro and celery tossed in chili oi, and jalapenos on top. The batter on the fish was perfect.   Was it spicy? It was a good managable spicy. It isn't like crazy Thai spicy, more flavorful chili flavor with a decent pinch of heat. I could use MORE spicy, but I like to teeter my spicy threshold.   The portions were good, but things were eaten clean and I think is a testament to how good it was. These were enjoyable in the way that you can just not get tired of the bold flavor offered.   The lady server was nice, but this is a place where you kinda have to wave to get some service sometimes.   This was definitely one of the better Chinese restaurants we have, specially if you want to try something a bit different. The menu definitely had many curiosities that even one of the most foodie of foodies will discover a new food. I don't know why it took me so long to go back, but the next time will be soon.",

    "text": "I had a roommate several years back who hailed from the Szechwan Province of China. He would cook up some of the tastiest food, I'll have to say - best roommate ever. Of course, I could barely feel my tongue after enjoying some of his dishes, but boy did it taste good.  Now if you are a mid-western white boy like myself, you may have noticed that some of the fine dining establishments in Chinatown will ask you, point blank, if you are certain you want it spicy. I could just be imagining this, maybe they actually ask everybody that (not just white boys), but I secretly suspect that they are always taking it down a notch on the heat level, to protect me from myself - and they are probably right in doing so.  Of course, this is not the case at Yun Nan Garden - they always bring the pain.  Last time I was there, my buddy and I ordered the beef stir fry and the lamb stir fry (local style). First of all the lamb was amazing, absolutely blew me away - I could have eaten another order. It was spicy (very spicy actually), but not when compared to the beef.   They must have cut up 3 or 4 whole jalapenos and at least a dozen or more Thai chilies in that beef stir fry - holy hulking jalapenos batman, it was hot. Oh but it was sooo tasty.  I suspect the location of this place has something to do with it, but they never ask me how hot I want it or if I'm sure I want to go with this or that option. Maybe being of the beaten path makes it less of a touristy place and so they figure I must know what I'm doing if I ended up here.   This place is worth hunting for and do not deny yourself the lamb, but I would recommend asking for a pitcher of water up front - something I plan on doing next time.",

When we went one evening we were the only non-Asian people in the restaurant.  Service was quick but not what you would call friendly.  At exactly 10pm (closing time), the waitress came over with the check and asked us to pay then so they could close out the registers.    The food, however, was fantastic.  The entrees come with huge portions and are definitely not the Americanized fare you find in most American-Chinese restaurants.  My partner got a dish of lamb ribs about the size of a finger.  I tried the kung pao chicken.  The chicken was delicious but extremely spicy.  Their steamed dumplings were great and very garlicky.",

It's crunchy and so yummy...completely unhealthy for you, but I'm not really looking to eat healthy when I come here.  I also tried the beef dry pot since I like dry pots, and we all thought the beef one was better than the lamb (it's made the same way but we just like beef more).  The dry pot has bean sprouts at the bottom which I think makes a nice contrast to the spicy beef (it helps to lessen the spiciness and add a crunch).  As for the tofu dish, I ended up liking it as well, but it wasn't what I thought I had ordered.  It's completely my fault though since I don't speak mandarin or read Chinese.  I was thinking by the English description \"fried tofu with pepper sauce\" that it would be cubes of crunchy fried tofu with a dipping sauce on the side, not a stir-fry with vegetables.  My only warning about this place is that if you are like me, and don't speak or read Chinese, you will find it more difficult to speak with the waitress and read the menu.  I'm ok with trying new things though so it's not a big deal to me.  Also you might feel a little uncomfortable among a full restaurant of Chinese speakers.  This time around, the waitress didn't say a single word to us, hehe, she didn't even try.  I don't care as long as the food comes and is yummy.",

Szechuan doesn't always mean spicy, although some of what they serve will peel the paint off the walls.  Heat without flavor is just an exercise in pain control.  Oh yes, there is heat aplenty, but there's also a deep flavor underlying the heat.  We started with the Yunnan noodle soup.  It was a clear broth, but very flavorful, and a good beginning to what came next.  At my Brother's recommendation, we ordered the boiled fish and beef in sauce (piquant), the Chongqing Spicy Chicken (it's a popcorn chicken style with deep fried chilis), and the green beans.  I was sweating by the time I was done, but what we took home was gone within 10 minutes of getting home by our son.  Oh yes, the place is only about the size of a postage stamp, and we had to sit at a round table with two other groups.  We were also the only ones in the place using English menus, if that tells you something.  I will not go to any other Chinese restaurant in Las Vegas again if I can help it.",

In the same plaza as Floyd Mayweather studio, and the VIP sport (you know, from that reality TV show about sports gambling). Delicious yunnan rice noodles+affordable, delicious side dishes. Their side dishes are at $6 for a plate- you can choose up to 3 side dishes per plate. Their beef combo (fu qi fei pian) side dish is amazing- super authentic! We also got the spicy firm tofu (dou gan), and the sliced pig ears. The spiciness from their side dishes is very numbing -just the way Yunnan and Sichuan dishes are supposed to be.   Will definitely comeback here when I'm in Vegas again!",

Once that happens, you can appreciate the deep, complex flavors in each dish.   When we come here, we always have to get at least the Fish in Chili Oil and the Lamb in Hot Pot or Lamb with cumin. They are perfect dishes. Not too spicy or salty, just right.   And though many other restaurants have similar dishes to those, that are just as good, what sets Yunnan Garden apart from the others is their cold dish selection. You get 3 choices for $6. They have these peanuts with fried fish and chili that is amazing. Also, they have this spicy tofu (Kao fu) that is equally as good. And if we don't want to spend the money to eat in, we'll just get the cold dish sides to go.   No one has cold dishes as good as Yunnan Garden, and combined with the high quality of their main entrees is what makes this my favorite.",

    "text": "I've been meaning to try this place and last night, I finally got to go with one of my friends. My friend had already bee to this place about twice before so he knew his way around, which was very helpful! I was pleasantly surprised that when I walked it, it was already semi-busy -- it wasn't like SLAMMED but it held a good decent amount of people. Almost all of the tables were already taken.   So my friend and I got seated, then some menus arrive, and then I start looking. Well, almost nothing looked familiar. Which was fine, but sometimes it's a little overwhelming but I do know that the one thing I want was LAMB. Anddd I left the decision to my friend HAHA :)  He ended up ordering lamb with cumin, fish and pig intestines boiled in chili oil, and chong qing spicy chicken.  Lamb with cumin: this dish came with a bunch of jalapeno peppers, red peppers, onions, and cilantro. It was delicious and by far, my favorite. I simply love lamb and cumin -- it is a wonderful taste. If you are unfamiliar with cumin, you may not get used to the flavor right away but trust me, this is the way to go. There is no better way of eating lamb than having it cooked with cumin. Definitely a dish you have to order when you're eating at Yunnan Garden. I also loved eating the jalapeno peppers from this dish too. Some were spicy and some were real spicy!  Fish and pig intestines boiled in chili oil: they actually messed up our order and gave us fish with pork instead of pork intestine but they later on corrected it. Anyways this dish didn't seem spicy to me at all ... but that's probably because I was eating the jalapeno peppers from the lamb dish? In fact, it really didn't do anything for me. The fish was good to eat and pig intestines is always a favorite of mine but the flavors were kind of bland. I was expecting some spicy action going on and this dish did not deliver :(  Chong qing spicy chicken: we originally ordered this and asked them to sub chicken wing for it cause according to my friend, it tastes better....but that didn't happen. Apparently they didn't have chicken wings. This dish, like the previous, did not deliver. I wasn't too interested in the flavors of this dish but one of the reasons could be that I was never really interested in popcorn chicken to begin with. And other than the numbing effect from the chicken, there wasn't much from it. The flavors just didn't wow me or captivate me, and wasn't really that spicy.  Perhaps I'm just not into the Yunnan style of cuisine.   One thing that I did NOT appreciate was that at the end of our dinner, they pretty much rushed us out even though there weren't any customers waiting for a table. When my friend went to use the restrooms, a server literally came over and asked if I wanted to box one of my dishes -- which was fine cause I was done. Then she boxed it, bagged it, and proceeded to take all the dishes, including the tea. Before she even finished, another server came with the check. O....kay? When I put my credit card down, it got swooped up quick and was charged in a minute.   I filled out their portion of the receipt. Then I was filling out mine with the final price but before I got to set the pen down or put the receipt in my wallet, the server came over here and decided to explain to me that the receipt I was holding was mine. She said that I didn't need to sign it and it was my copy to keep. Thank you for that but you could have at least waited to see if I really was going to give you both copies first. It's like saying, \"Oh thank you for giving me both gifts but you didn't have to!!\" Well gee, they weren't both for you but thanks for assuming. I know which copy is yours and which is mine. I mean, I supposed it's nice of her, but I was already annoyed that she took away the TEA before I was done and that just kind of annoyed me a little bit more.   I typically like to enjoy a cup of tea or two after a meal and before I leave the restaurant. I appreciate their fast service cause sometimes, it is hard at other restaurants to close the check. But damn, my friend didn't even come back from his restroom trip and you already took away everything AND charged my card. He couldn't even get a last cup of tea. I've never had that happen to me at a restaurant before. And I guess I know now ... you do not take my tea away from me!   Would I come back? Probably. I'd come back just for the lamb with cumin dish. Maybe try something new as well. But I'll remember to have to hold onto my tea stuff at the end.  A tip. Try to bring someone Chinese with you. These servers loved talking to us in mandarin and unfortunately, that was not our native tongue. We understood but we couldn't really reply. Their English wasn't that great either. There was a younger server whose English was decent -- she at least understood what we were saying to her in English.",

When I go to Vegas for business, I know that no matter what, I have to come here to get my Sichuan fix.   I highly recommend the chopped fried chicken pieces with chili peppers, the beer with chopped onions, lamb in dry pot, and the mapo tofu. You really can't go wrong with anything.   I am kind of down on the fact that I've always experienced Chinese chefs being stubborn. They changed chefs not to long ago and they don't have the whole fried fish and the chef just won't make it. The atmosphere is also not the cleanest. Overall, this is a great place where the food won't disappoint and it will make you forget you are in the U.S.",

    "text": "2 words describe my experience at Yunnan: pleasantly surprising. I'm half-Chinese and I'm very picky when it comes to Chinese food and Americanized \"Chinese\" food makes me sad.  A lot of Chinese people told me about this place but I've been putting off giving this place a try since I heard most of the items on their menu is spicy. I don't do spicy.  I was browsing through the menu and sure enough, 90% of the items on the menu had not one, but two peppers next to their name! Yikes! I saw the spare ribs with garlic didn't have the two pepper symbols and I love garlic so I chose that. The garlic was minced and crispy fried and the flavor was just great covering the spare ribs. I sprinkled the fried garlic on the other dishes we got including the MaPo tofu. I think tofu is the only thing I don't mind eating spicy. It was good and it took several bites before my nose started running.  The shocker on the menu was the Chongqing Spicy Chicken. The big plate was at least 50% red peppers. I was very afraid and highly intimidated until I tried a small piece of chicken. The chicken was lightly breaded, fried and super crispy. Reminds me of my Chinese grandmother's fried chicken. To my surprise, it wasn't spicy. I mean, there was a bite to it but not a kick. It was absolutely delicious and enjoyable. This was my favorite out of the dishes we tried and I'll get this again.  The service was ok. A lick of Chinese might help you a lot. I was watching and listening to Shawn and our server's interaction and it wore me out!",

    "text": "I've actually been here quite a few times, twice in the past month or so. Probably been here maybe total 10 times or so, so far? But none of the times have i seen this place so packed. Last time i came here, granted it was xmas day, so it got to the point where my friend and i \"dap toi\" (cantonese saying) which pretty much means, multiple parties sitting at the same table, just for the sake of having a table to use, period.   This time, i came with my friend, on a sunday night, and it was pretty packed, almost full, but not to point where people were waiting at the front for a table.   The two times, had some overlapping dishes so will describe it when it comes  Lamb with cumin: This time, my friend is a huge fan of lamb and cumin (skewers) so i decided to order that. Both this time and last time, flavor was pretty spot on, if anything that i had to critique, was not enough lamb. Aside from that, the jalepenos was a hit n miss on if it was spicy or not, but flavor wise, with the cumin... Delicious ! Probably was the \"spiciest\" dish of them all.   Chong Qing La Zi Ji (Spicy chicken w/ chilis): First time, i had ordered this, i was expecting it to come as cut chicken wings, but this time, it was like, popcorn chicken. Cuz i SWEAR, thats how it was before. Thinking it may have changed, we decided to eat it. After talking with my mom, who i have came here many times with before, she said you had to specially request it to be made with wings. Ok, so this time, I had specifically asked the waitress for chicken wing, she said ok. When the order came, it was the \"popcorn chicken\" style again. Asked another waitress why it was this, and not the chicken wing i had asked for, and she mentioned they dont do chicken wing, only this style. HMMM.... (more later) but back to flavor, it was like popcorn chicken fried with dried red peppers. I mean, its seasoned nicely, but hey! wheres the spiciness ?!   \"Water Boiled Fish\" (Fished cooked in chili oil): Didnt get it last time, but ordered it this time because this friend loves spicy. Originally, i had asked for water and pork intestines, but the first time it came out, I dont know if the waitress who took our order didnt understand (more later) or what, but it came out fish and pork. like pork cut into little strips. Asked a different waitress, had it re-done with fish and pork intestine (why they use pork instead of pig, i dont know....) When it came out, its either their chef changed or style changed. i dont recall the sauce being so thick. Back then, when it came out, you could almost swear theres like a centimeter of red chili oil on top. Flavor was fine but as with the previous dish, not spicy.   So usually after dinner, not only for chinese, but any other cuisine as well, you like to sit there and rest, drink some tea/soda/water/etc, and let the food settle a bit before leaving. For some odd reason, they seemed to be rushing. I mean, if it was busy, like it was on X'mas, its understandable, but it wasnt THAT busy. I had went to the restroom while my friend finished up eating. After i came back, i was told that the lady came to box up leftovers, cleaned EVERYTHING up including our tea and tea cups, brought her the check, took it and charged her, and brought it back, all within the period of me going to the restroom. WOW! I mean thats great they are so fast, but what the heck? We felt really rushed at the end. NO GOOD !   I swear they used to be more spicy, and better on their accuracy. I mean, even the mapo tofu was spicy enough to make me choke sometimes, let alone these few dishes we had ordered. I was sweating, but no where near how much i used to sweat, due to the spiciness.   Ok now to emphasize on the \"more later\" parts. Since being seated, they love speaking to you in mandarin. Granted both times, we were able to understand, but this time, we understand, but arent fluent enough to reply. I'm not sure if its their style to be against those who can't speak mandarin or what. I'll probably give them one more chance, with my mom next time. If still off, welp.... you know what that means..",

    "text": "Experience:  Friends invited me to try this place. They said it was their favorite Chinese  restaurant in town, and they have great taste in food, so I was definitely in!!!!  There were 8 of us who met up.   Facility:  This place is tucked back off the main streets in what you would think are the back of the strip malls, but they actually added another one facing the opposite way. I guess just GPS it.  LOL!  Anyway, it is a very small place with that family owned feel having tables and chairs and maybe 30 seats total, if that. Clean enough, with a display case of very interesting cold food appetizers, such as ducks head.   Service:  the service is VERY attentive.  Very polite and helpful. The only issue is that most of them don't speak English. This makes asking for extra napkins a little challenging...hope you practiced your Charades skills. LOL!  There was at least one waitress who spoke fairly good English.   Food:  So this group decided to do the family style.  So every person ordered something different, and I ordered the plate of smoked duck. I can't remember the names of everything we ordered, but some of my favorites were (these will not be the exact names on the menu - sorry!!!) Lamb soup pot - the broth was delicious on rice, and although there were a ton of bones, the lamb was tasty too.  Sweet/Sour cabbage - I LOVE cabbage, so I liked it...just wish it was more savory than sweet. Just not a huge fan of sweet food.  Fried fish - this was so light and delicious.  The lady at out table who ordered it, got it \"non-spicy\", so I would love to try their spicy version next time.  There were a lot of dishes, but these were the stand outs.  Oh yeah, and they forgot my duck, so I never got to taste that dish. LOL!   Overall: I would agree this is the best Chinese I've had in town here, but I would consider this authentic and amazing. This is not your fortune cookie egg roll type of Americanized Chinese food.  But I have to admit, I'm still looking for that call in Chinese place that has the folks cooking in giant woks where I can get some decent beef and broccoli and a good eggroll!",

It was INSANELY busy last night and they were trying to just get people seated, served and get them out.  Again, don't expect excellent customer service here, just expect the best Chinese food you may ever have here in the states. It's the best.   We brought my boyfriend's parents here last night and they haven't had much authentic Chinese food, and they were very impressed.   The best thing we had last night was the Rice Noodles w/ Sweet and Sour soup and spicy pork stew. I can't even begin to tell you how amazing the taste is with this soup. It's a perfect blend of spices, herbs, the cilantro that gives it that nice topping and just the pork itself...mouth watering.   We also shared: Cured pork with green beans, which was okay. It was more like cripsy dried out bacon. It was the only thing I've ever ordered that I wasn't a fan of.  Cumin Lamb, always a favorite. Not too spicy, but the cumin in it is very strong. So be prepared.  Garlic Shrimp, good, but not my favorite. A good dish if you can't have soy.  Chongqing Spicy Shrimp, awesome. This is one of the most recommended dishes and I see why. It is friend with tempura, but it's so bold, spicy and full of flavor.  Overall, I absolute LOVE this place. It's so good and the prices are still very reasonable for the amazing quality this place has. They raised the prices by $5-7 per dish. But again, it's so worth it.   Be prepared to wait, but also be prepared to be amazed. This is Chinese like you've never had it. You'll never wanted Americanized again.",

Much of the menu was accompanied by little chili symbols, some dishes up to 4 or 5 if I remember correctly so if you like spice this may be a good spot to kill off some tastebuds.",

Its the best Chinese food in Las Vegas for Yunnan style food. If you are from North Dakota and eat Egg rolls and General Chows chicken, you will not like this place. Go to Panda Express. Do not expect beef and broccoli.  If you have an understanding of very fresh Home made Southern Chinese food and like spicy well made dishes, this is your place. (They do have some non-spicy dishes)  Do expect super fresh, very well made food. (Not much sea food here).  The have cold appetizers that are great. After you get a table, go up to the cash register. You will see all of them laid out. You can get 3 on a plate. I like the dried beef, cucumber and cabbage.  They have a fish dish that is simple and does not smell like fish. No bones. Not one. Its so tender. Its the fish filet in brown sauce with garlic. Its not spicy. I think its #58  Their soups are very good.  I love their beef in spicy szechuan sauce and the wonton in chile sauce. Kung Pao chicken is great!  You can feed 8 people for under $100.   The decor is sparse. But the food divine. Do not go here on Christmas (oy vey).  This is real Chinese food. Tour buses full of people from China go here.   The wait staff is very attentive. You can take a cab from the strip. Its not far. Just off Spring Mtn Rd. It is hard to find as its hidden in a strange strip mall. Good for me, I know where it is.  This is not your typical Chinese food style. Many dishes are spicy but there are some that are not. Give it a try. You will love it.  UPDATE: 4/30/14 Looks like they raised the prices a little bit. Just as good as ever.",

    "text": "This place is Terrible. I can't believe I wasted a Vegas meal on this place. Where do you go for the best Chinese food? Chinatown right? WRONG. So we walk into this place and are greeted with obvious shock and surprise, like what are you doing here? It was bizarre to say the least. We sit down and look at the menu, lots of choices most of which are spicy. We sat there for quite some time before a waitress came to take our order, she couldn't speak English very well so we pointed to the item which was also written in Chinese. The food comes out one dish at a time. We ordered house fried rice. Which turned out to be shaved cured pork belly, not bacon mind you..think salty pork, green onion and rice with an overwhelming flavor of fish sauce. It was also quite oily. Our second dish of pork spare ribs in sweet and sour sauce comes. The flavor is good but there is very little meat and mostly bone in bite sized pieces. It's not cool to be fishing in your mouth for bones especially when you feel like your being observed by patrons and staff alike. The third dish of smoked duck comes, clearly it is liquid smoke, not True smoked meat. Nothing good about this meal. I am not a rude person so we asked our server to box the leftovers so as not to insult them. I told her she could just put it in one box. I believe this offended her as she was adamant that they be put in separate boxes...ok, we walked out of there and immediately threw it in the trash which was our intent from the beginning. Hence the one box. Don't go here...fair warning. Hard lesson learned. I will be eating on the strip for my Chinese food fix from now on. I almost forgot a very angry lady came inside to complain about their delivery driver, apparently he cut her off or something in the parking lot. She asked to talk to him but the waitresses never went and got him. They were rude to her and she left very upset.",

    "text": "We had a simple meal at Yun Nan Garden, but sometimes it's the uncomplicated dishes that leave you with the biggest smile. Yun Nan is known for Szechuan style Chinese, and I think most people go there looking for mind-blowing spice or some other adventurous menu journey. We just wanted some vegetables and some noodles.   The restaurant is a tad hard to find. If you know where DJK, Mr. Tofu and Pho Kim Long are located, then you are a step ahead. It is kind of in that same shopping center, but about 3 blocks south down either Valley View or Wynn on a mysterious parking lot street named \"Schiff.\" The street has its own name, but it is literally a parking lot. The interior is nice and clean, and the staff is young and friendly.   We ordered a chow mein, which my husband was concerned would be a fried noodle, but the server assured it was a soft noodle, and for our leafy green, she recommended the snow cabbage. After scarfing down those oodles of noodles, I demanded another plate, but my hubbie curbed my gluttonous impulse. He was right. I didn't have room for more. And that snow cabbage has been placed on my top\" 5 favorite vegetables of all time\" list along with regular cabbage, okra, broccoli and A-tsai.  The only complaint: They charged us extra for using our credit card despite the fact that our bill was $19 and change. Their minimum is $20. Next time I'll have to get that second plate of noodles. I'd rather put a buck towards a tasty treat than towards a silly \"service charge.\"",

One of the biggest complaints that I hear from Chinese travellers in America is about the quality of the food in restaurants. I set myself a challenge to find a restaurant in Vegas that would serve the same quality of food that can be found across China, and I was extremely pleased to discover Yun Nan Garden... If you want to eat authentic Chinese food, this restaurant is highly recommended!   My colleagues had all been to Las Vegas several times, and were very sceptical at first. As soon as the food arrived I could see the smiles appear, and everyone started making comments about how good the food looked and tasted.  We ordered a full table of food: A wide range of spicy eggplant, duck, pork, and lamb dishes, and everything was very good (the mapo tofu was particularly excellent).   The restaurant is small, and off the main road, but more importantly it's clean and the service is very good. There were only two English speaking westerners in the restaurant when we arrived, but they were well served so there's no need to take Mandarin lessons before going!",

    "text": "A cuisine that has recently started appearing on the Vegas food scene is Chinese Szechuan, and one of the first restaurants to start serving it was Yunnan Garden. Szechuan cooking is much spicier than food from other regions of China, yet traditionally, Szechuan cooking was not as pungent or as hot as it is today. I don't find Szechuan cuisine I've had to be nearly as hot as what I've had at Indian or Thai restaurants, so if you prefer milder foods you don't have to avoid this cuisine that sounds spicier than it is.  The first dish that came to us today was the least impressive and least expensive, the Dan Dan Noodle ($5.95). It consisted of a sweet and overly salty sauce underneath a mound of noodles sprinkled with peanuts. You mix the noodles and sauce to combine, which you can somewhat do in a way that caters to your own preference for heavy or light dressing. The next dish to arrive was #156, sauteed seasonal vegetables with garlic sauce ($7.85, I'm not an expert on Chinese vegetables, but after looking at some pictures online I think what we had was Choy Sum). Though this generic 'seasonal vegetable' dish appears on most Chinese menus, you aren't quite sure what exactly what you'll be getting, and the degree of expertise used to prepare it can vary dramatically. This version was fantastic, with perfectly cooked vegetables, a light sauce that barely coated them, and excellent flavor. It's hard to tell where the flavor is coming from since there is barely any color, but I'm guessing there might be some MSG in there somewhere, judging by how shiny it was (Anthony Bourdain claims food gets glossier the further West you move due to the use of this magical ingredient. MSG produces a sensation on the tongue which can only be described as umami). Other than the fact that children and pregnant women should stay away from it, I'm not averse to the use of MSG. It's a pretty remarkable ingredient that can really add to a dish, however, it should be consumed in moderation and is usually considered culinary cheating. If the vegetables didn't have MSG, the Fish Fillet in Spicy House Special Sauce ($10.25, #57) that was our entree almost certainly did (see how shiny it is in my picture). I was totally willing to risk consuming the controversial ingredient, however, because the dish was great and a fantastic deal; the plate could easily have served four people with hearty appetites. Though seafood is not an integral part of Szechuan food, freshwater fish is, and there is an abundance of it on Yunnan's menu. This fish was flaky and moist, and the sauce was pungent, spicy, and rich with the color of chilies. I loved the use of crunchy fried soy beans on top and the bed of incredibly fresh soy bean sprouts underneath, but it was a bit oily. Despite the oil, I didn't feel stuffed, and despite the possible health risks, I would order it again.  It's a little difficult to get your bearings when ordering at Yunnan Garden as the choices are numerous and the descriptions vague, but everything coming out of the kitchen looked pretty good. Don't count on much help deciphering from the waitstaff unless you speak the language, but if you stick to your personal preferences you should be fine. Just remember, don't bring the kids and leave the pregnant ladies at home. (Note: Many restaurants -not just Chinese- use MSG, and it is also present in a lot of processed snack foods because of its addictive qualities. I'm not trying to single out Yunnan Garden as a culprit.)  Tip: The restaurant is difficult to find. The best way I can direct you is to go to the far back side of the one story strip mall between Valley View and Arville on the south side of Spring Mountain. It's part of that same set of buildings.",

Yes there is one pretty waitress who doesn't smile much but if you can get her to smile she is beautiful (This is an entertaining challenge)! The food here is consistently great! Noodles are fantastic and one of the best in Las Vegas hands down. Anyone who slams this place is either from a competing restaurant, has never eaten At Yun Nan Gardens or has no clue about what Great Spicy Chinese food. Best tip to how good this place is...Tours bringing visitors from China bring their travelers to Yun Nan Gardens by the bus loads daily! Don't shy away from going there because they always have tables for 2 or 4 to accommodate you while the bus loads eat at tables for 10-12. Do yourself a favor go to Yun Nan Gardens, enjoy the food and take the challenge to make the Waitress Smile!",

Average service, not much to say on decor, but..  OMG!  SPICY!  SPICY SPICY SPICY!    I normally can down just about anything, I LOVE Curry, but a third into my meal, I had to cry uncle, it was too much!  I was there on a first date and we couldn't stop laughing because our faces were bright red!  I even tried taking it home and eating it later that night with some yogurt and it burst into flames while eating it!     (Maybe it's a great date spot, all things considered, because you can just make small talk about how spicy everything was...)",

We were probably the only non-Chinese in there on a week night, which was definitely a good sign. The food was quite spicy, but tolerable if you're used to it. In fact, if I went back, I'd probably get a spicier dish. We has some spicy garlic shrimp, noodles, spicy tofu, and a very nice cilantro-filled soup. They made some plain noodles for my flavor-averse son. Certainly a refreshing break from the fatty, bland crap typically available on the strip. This place is worth it if you like a good Chinatown-type restaurant.",

    "text": "Superb!  And a shocker to some degree. (more on that in a bit)  Can't argue with the reviews already given. I don't know what region the food is of origin, but Spicy is it's foundation. And it's tasty!!  A Saturday lunch. 3 tables active. Two other couples, and one big family. I was not the only tourist looking patron. But I was outnumbered. And thats GOOD! Maybe 15 total tables in the place available. Nice size in my opinion. Good clean room too. Yes, new owners. \"wun yeer now thank yoo\" (no offense intended)  Spicy & Sour Noodle Soup, $5.95 (like spaghetti w/ chili broth, and herbs) Wontons tossed in chili sauce, $5.95 (YUM, nice garlic hints) Sliced Chicken w/ Szechwan Sauce, $8.95 (YUM YUM, spicy smoke flavor  trails off w/ a sweetness, YUM) Yes the rice is done w/ perfection as a goal. Details, all in the details.  The \"shocker\"........ This menu is as authentic as I've ever seen.  Reminds me of times in San Francisco's Chinatown when I might have ordered off a menu to be refused by the wait staff  \"No no no no, shaking their head\". You see, I'm a big tall Gringo looking dude......they were just protecting me is my guess. Saving my fragile \"naive\" palate.  Yun Nan Garden offers what I think you can't get many places in SF anymore. At least spelled out on the menu, here they are. Chongqing Spicy Frog. Blackened Pepper w/ Eel. Three Flavors (Squid, Fish, Black Sea Cucumber) Chickens Intestine w/ pepper sauce. And the afore mentioned Pigs Ear.  Don't be afraid though. You will just be missing out on some tasty meals.  I like the location, easy in, and easy out. Great parking!! Just below Spring Mountain, 3rd driveway on the right off Valley View. Yun Nan will be on your right, far corner of the first building. (mid lot)  7 days a week, 11am - 10pm.  And they have 2 additional locations: Monterey Park, CA. 301 N. Garfield Ave. Hacienda Heights, CA. 1229 S. Hacienda Blvd.  Enjoy!!",

The thing that I love about Chinese food is that there are so many different types of Chinese cuisine.  Yun Nan Cuisine is extremely spicy and the peppers they use will actually make your tongue go numb. I didn't like it as much when I was younger but it has grown on me.  My parents took me here one night when we visited Vegas and the dishes were made so well.  The dish that stood out the most was surprisingly a simple Chinese vegetable dish.   I could tell the Chef knew what he was doing. With real Wok experience, he brought out the \"wok hei\" or \"wok qi\" for my mandarin speaking friends.  If you have never experienced eating Chinese food embodied with wok hei then your missing out.   Seriously wiki it and then come here and try the food. I hope the Chef is still flipping and frying that food, in that wok over an open flame because everyone should get a chance to eat quality Chinese food.",

Yun Nan China is well known for their spicy foods! so they can really make it tingle. just letting you guys know.  but overall its a great place to eat, only downside, they close at 9pm. wtf is that right, especially if its vegas, cmon everything is open 24 hours.. apparently not..    but if you wanna just go grab some grub somewhere youve never been try Yun Nan,.. tasty tasty tasy",

My family is from the yunnan province of china so I am use to the home cooked dishes! The yunnan noodles are nothing compared to kunmings noodles but it's close enough!",

We ordered the bean curd pork and boiled spicy chicken. We liked the bean curd pork and spicy chicken. The food is good but i'm giving it 3 stars because of our difficulties with the servers.",

When walking into this restaurant you honestly feel that you're not in Las Vegas but in China.   So I tried the Beef spicy mini dry pot which was out of this world. It's a dish that's like a mini hot pot but without the soup. It had bean sprouts, tender beef, onions and love because this dish was amazing!  My second dish was the Chongqing Spicy Chickens and it tasted like salt and pepper pork chops which are my favorite. It had tons of dried peppers and fried chicken. This dish is a winner as well and a must try.   Overall, I'll be coming back for more.. Just remember this place will make you sweat but in a good way..",

    "text": "Originally, we were planning to visit the place next door, but it was too crowded, so we ended up here instead.  The literal translation of this place is Yunnan Crossing-the-bridge Noodles.  The place was just mostly filled when we arrived, but filled up quick shortly after we sat down.  We got a variety of dishes of just the two of us, starting with Spicy Fish & Tofu, it was just ok spicy, and the broth was a bit too soupy for some reason when compared to other pictures that were posted here.  The flavor was a bit bland overall.  The Spicy Lamb Chop a disaster, might as well call it lamb bones instead, as there was not a single piece of lamb meat it, and the dish was a bit salty too.  As for noodles, I went with Braised Beef Noodles, it had a few pieces of beef stew in it and a few beef tendon, a nice warm bowl of noodles.  Yunnan Crossing-the-bridge Noodles is really similar to dipping ramen, except the noodles and broth were already together, noodles are Chinese rice noodles, and only the ingredients come separated.  You can throw everything in there, just a few things, or even none.  It was pretty good as well.  I guess they did not have much option to customize here like other places I visited.  If I come to Yunnan Garden again, I would just stick with noodles, since their other dishes here are just not up to par with restaurants in this area.  Service was provided by your typical Asian poker face servers like most Asian restaurants.",

    "text": "Items Selected: White Rice Szechuan Dan Dan Noodle Yunnan Style Dried Beef Ma Po Tofu Lamb with Cumin Eel Sauteed with Dry Pepper Eggplant in Garlic Sauce Chopped Smoked Duck Chongqing Spicy Chicken  Tucked away behind the Kim Long Mall, near Chinatown Plaza, and doing the spicy thing in Las Vegas long before Chengdu Taste rolled into town, it was on the suggestion of a friend that five adults and two children sat down at Yun Nan Garden for a meal of *red star* specials that did little to dissuade even the timid thanks to the sort of spice focused on flavor rather than scorching the tongue tasteless.  Named for the Southwestern China Province of Yunnan, an area revered by practitioners of Eastern Medicine thanks to its diversity of plants and herbs, diners visiting Yun Nan Garden are quickly met by a golden Buddha on walking through the doors, a dining room featuring tables of varied sizes spread out to seat perhaps one hundred comfortably, and all that space to be filled on a Friday night by 6:45.  Providing English-friendly menus and forks, but otherwise as traditional as anyplace on Spring Mountain from its service structure to the clientele, it was at a rounded-table with a rotating center that decisions were made with a focus on a variety, most the choices denoted as spicy, though a more detailed look would prove that the warning was present on almost 50% of Yun Nan Garden's Cuisine.  Struggling for water and dishes at first, but oddly finding the service improving incrementally as the restaurant got busier, it was with a flood of plates that the table was suddenly alive with color and bold aromatics, the dried Beef which arrived first eating much like Jerky with a mild numbing effect while the Ma Po Tofu featured a heaping portion of soft cubes bathed in an oil-based Sauce that carried the spice straight to the sinuses without the more expected effect of leaving the lips and tongue tingling.   Turning next to stir-fry, the noodle-like Eels pleasantly slippery in a tangle of Onions and dried Chiles, Lamb with Cumin proved to be the nights most fragrant dish with both the tender bits of Meat and Peppers picking up a lot of earth and nutty notes, the Eggplant in Garlic Sauce similarly submitting to the flavors around it while still maintaining a fibrous, springy texture.  Turning up the temperature with Dan Dan Noodles served Szechuan style, the combination of the region's eponymous Peppers and a whole lot of Garlic best taken in moderation for those moving from plate to plate, chopped Duck was a complete change of pace from everything else with a great bit of smoke and bones that are navigable, the Chongqing Spicy Chicken a return to Yun Nan's strike zone that mostly tastes like really good double-fried Chicken...unless of course one chooses to chew up a few of the accompanying Peppers that almost immediately renders the palate tone-deaf and mouth watering.  FOUR AND A HALF STARS:  Doing the 'hot' thing right, not just trying to torch mouths but instead focused on flavor, Yun Nan Garden is a hidden gem removed from the main drag that is Spring Mountain Road, the service better than many similar spots and everything from the tables to the restrooms also much cleaner.",

We showed up for lunch on Tuesday, around 12:30 and waited about 15-20 minutes for a table for five.  We ordered a little too much food, especially since it's considered an early lunch for us.  Braised beef noodle soup - good and flavorful  Dumplings in chili oil - too much garlic, but not enough flavor  Spicy fried chicken - flavor was good, but the meat was chopped up into tiny pieces which made it hard to find under all the chili peppers  Dry fried pork intestines - flavor was good, but you can smell that it wasn't cleaned very well  Deep fried beef jerky - not good, do not order  Snowpea leaves in garlic sauce - flavorful  Service was just ok.    Food had a lot of MSG.  I don't mind MSG in my food, but I don't like it to overwhelm everything else.    Probably won't be back.",

This place has cold cut side dishes at the front of the counter that you can also order with fair prices - you can choose 3 items for $6.   #1 which was the \"Famous Yunnan Rice Noodle Soup\" was bland, but may be ideal for someone who is looking for a less oily noodle soup.

Other reviews state that prices have risen in recent months, and it certainly doesn't make me want to rush back.  WON TON SOUP WITH SPICY PORK: Generous portion, boxed with noodles and dumplings separate for at-home assembly. Spicy broth with plenty of cilantro and pork, tasty dumplings and generous portion of noodles.  GARLIC PORK SPARE RIB: A little underwhelmed by this. I'm a huge garlic lover and the plentiful crunchy-fried version in this dish was sweeter and more understated than I expected, it's used more for texture. Did not finish this dish.  Service was typical for the area. Location is clean and organized. Other reviews mention the tour bus visits being a regular occurrence, which would be a deterrent for me.

Spicy fish fillet- 5 stars. Super crispy, slightly spicy, and very flavorful. I love he cilantro and chiles that add to the dish.   Spicy pork wonton- 3 stars. It's not as good as noodle man, and that's because all you gotta do is add the chilli oil with pepper flake sauce on top to almost replicate it. The standard dish just comes in the chilli oil with no pepper flakes. Once I added it, it bumped up a star.  Boiled beef in spicy soup- 5 stars. This stuff wasn't as as spicy as I had anticipated. The beef is suuuuuper tender and flavorful. I wish there were more veggies in here but yummy!! I saved leftovers and turned it into a stir fry the next day by adding a ton of veggies.   Chongqing spicy chicken - 4 stars. Definitely good, but I have had better elsewhere.   Spicy mini lamp chops- 5 stars. This was reallllllly good. I'd come back and get this again without a question. The fried batter was flavorful and it was slightly spicy.   Service- I don't think some of the waitresses understood what I was asking. The pointing at photos method has worked out well so far. Service is inconsistent.   Total: 4.3 stars.  Will be back to try more!!!!!!!",

Talking about it now make me want to make another visit. There is always lots of people and line out the door. So get here early!!!   Service is quick and friendly!",

Almost did not qualify on our hole in the wall list as their bathroom was way too clean and their decor actually followed a matching theme and no chipped plates, so we were a little worried.  However, the service was great and food was fantastic and authentic Yunnan, their soup was so pure and flavorful. Really made you feel great after eating.",

It's located in Chinatown right when you get off the Spring Mountain exit, a few streets behind the plaza Pho Kim Long is located in.   I come here frequently for take out if I'm craving something spicy. Their spicy boiled white fish is my favorite and is mouthwateringly delicious! They give you a generous portion of fish and cabbage boiled in a spicy soup. It's a little pricier ($18 or so) but well worth the amount you get. It couldn't definitely feed two people and make a phenomenal dinner with some white rice!   I was recommended this restaurant from one of my old coworkers who is Chinese. When I told her I'm addicted to spicy food, she told me I had to try Yunnan Garden. I took her advice and would now call myself a loyal guest. Love this place!",

I ordered beef noodles and while the broth was flavorful, there was hardly any meat. The broth was far too hot, and I had to wait almost an hour to fully enjoy. I did like the fact that you get a lot of noodles, and the meal was only 10.50 (including drink). I enjoyed the fact that the service was so prompt and ordering was relatively easy. They do have a sort of serving line in the front of the restaurant (almost like panda express)/ except the food looked amazing. Its only if you order certain meals and eat in though (I asked about it and was rudely told \"No, that's only for an appetizer. You can't have that\". Other than that, it was an okay meal, may try something different next time I'm there.",

The food is OK but definitely needs to step up their game to compete with the new competitors. Their service is the real problem. The waitress acts like she hates her life. She first ignored us when we try to order and then gave us an attitude when we asked for to go boxes. I feel that they have already stopped trying and don't care anymore. IMHO, they need to change their mindset in customer service and need to change it quickly before too late.",

    "text": "Located in the China town just a hop away from the strip (u do need to drive there).  Had our last meal in vegas last Saturday  here as a family.  We ordered medium spicy periwinkle for me, pot stickers for my older son, Yun Nan rice noodle with chicken for me also, beef with black bean sauce for my husband, and tomato egg (not on the menu) for my younger son.    Everything tasted ok to good to me, we all had our fill for Chinese at the end except my younger one who was the picky eater for the night.  They are not related to the one in Temple City on Las Tunas according to the old waiter,  even though the name is the same.  The menu is very different also.    Overall, the food was decent but not great.  The \"over the bridge\" rice noodle or \"guo qiao mi xian\" as in Chinese is not authentic in taste at all.  I've had this so many times to know the taste was off right away.  It could be passed off as \" guo qiao mi xian\" to the less experienced palette, but it didn't quite nail the nuanced balance of meat, aromatics, and body.  I didn't try the pot stickers, but judging from my older son's swift action, I know it must be edible.  But then again he is such an easy kid, when he's hungry he pretty much tolerates any food except the sea food.   The beef with black bean sauce was ok but not great.    The periwinkle dish was pretty good.  The tomato egg is little bit on the salty side and too oily for my taste.    Overall it was an ok place.  No service, no water on the table either just a pot of tea which is not what I wanted at 10pm at night.    Medium portion compare with some of the Chinese restaurants in LA.  But the price is not too high for Vegas.    Owners don't speak English.  With tax, tip and my hubby's beer, the bill was under $100.  Not too bad for Vegas.",

We ordered the noodle soup and it was exactly what we were hoping for.  The spice level was numbing and the broth was so flavorful- just as we had experienced in the Yun Nan province.  This alone is a 5 star dish and I will definitely order it again and again.   From the cold counter, we picked out some spicy cold beef, pig ear, and peanuts with dried anchovies-  to quiet our rumbling tummies while we waited for our order. It was the perfect appetizer and the heat in the beef prepped us for the spice level that was to come. We also ordered the spareribs in fried garlic, sauteed pea sprouts, and chicken fried rice.  These were pretty good as well- but obviously that noodle soup was the star.    The service wasn't the friendliest, but quick and efficient.  It is that numbing spice that is calling me back! I am so glad to have finally found a Chinese Restaurant that I can proudly take my in-laws when they are visiting from Hong Kong.",

    "text": "slow service, unique menu, VERY spicy food via over-roasted chili seeds ===  In the same way that Peet and Starbuck extract extra flavor by burning their beans, Yunnan uses a very oily (peanut-based) burned/blackened chili seed paste as the base for their dishes. Must admit I'm new to food from this province/style, but every dish seems to imitate the flavors of my nana's hottest salsa: lots of cilantro and red-hot peppers that leave your nerve endings twitching for relief.  Other Yelpers weren't kidding that this is a destination for Chinese folks. We were the only non-Chinese people in the restaurant.  SERVICE SO SLOW WE THOUGHT THEY'D MISSED THEIR MEAT DELIVERY... When we arrived we were seated in the corner and the server dropped the menus and hot tea. We then waited 30 minutes while three other parties arrived, were seated, their orders taken and their food delivered. Finally after a large 8-top next to us left, someone noticed us and came to take our order. We had started to wonder if the tea was a special arsenic blend and perhaps they had missed their New Year's meat delivery!  After 20 minutes I thought we might flee, but with the order taken from the third table to arrive after us I just wanted to see what would happen... I am on vacation after all, and am not rushing anywhere (ah, what a feeling). When the girl finally came over and I asked her for a reality check, her quizzical look reminded me why the menu items are numbered -- no English here. \"Thirty minutes\" with a distraught look seemed to convey something because she bowed her head in shame and took two steps back. Freeze frame. Non verbals abound. Impressive.  [aside] Sometime soon I want to do some research on cultural gestures of the body. Chinese take to pointing with a single finger, arm outstretched in a very quick motion -- think Godzilla. I noticed it standing in front of Notre Dame in Paris as hundreds of folks made this gesture at the 20-story monster in front of us that was the cathedral, as if there might be some mistake and they'd be looking at something else instead. This gesture contrasts the open-handed seemingly humble gesture of hospitality from Japan. Hmmm...  [end aside]  Goddam this food is effing hot. The noodle soup is dark red because that's oily chili paste in there! Tofu has a single flavor -- HOT. Lamb is exactly the same. GODDAM. It's uncomfortable to the absolute maximum that the body can take without just wretching it out all over the table.  I love it. What a burn! My scalp's every pore is pouring sweat down my neck and back and my nose is running faster than Usain Bolt in summer at Beijing. My face is on fire. My eyes are watering from the fumes wafting from what's left of my lips. My stomach is yelling bloody murder and threatening to take matters into its own hands with a promise that if I don't purge soon, the back-end burn will be at least as bad if not worse. Wow.  At some point, I gave up before I lost consciousness and stumbled to the counter to pay the bill. \"How was it?\" they asked.  My eyes widened as I drew a fiery breath, tears still streaming down my face, \"OH! MY! GOD!\"",

I may have checked in once, so far, on here but have been at least 15 times and will continue to come here.  Real review:  Timing: Why should timing come before anything else? Well, during peak lunch/dinner hours, this place often gets flooded with tour buses full of tourists. I think this is a testament to how much this place is loved but it damn sure has deterred me from eating there a few times because of the wait times that'll come with such an influx of diners.  Plan your day accordingly or wade through a sizeable wait....either way...it's worth the effort. Which brings us to....  Food: As many commentators have notice, this is pretty un-Americanized Chinese food, if you're looking for simply a better version of Panda Express you should go to P.F. Chang's. So if  that's what you're expecting, get ready to either be disappointed or have your mind blown. The first thing you'll notice is that they have a huge selection of food across several categories: Soups/Noodle dishes, Seafood, Beef, Pork, Poultry, etc. The second thing you'll notice is that many of the dishes are spicy. They have plenty of delicious non-spicy dishes but if you're ok with the heat, you'll be able to enjoy more of their selection. Unfortunately, I tend to be a creature of habit, so I have not branched out and tried a lot of their dishes but what I have tried, I love, and I am sure their other dishes don't disappoint. We usually stick to Mo Pau Tofu,Crispy Spicy Chicken and Salt and Pepper Shrimp when we go and they never disappoint. Also, on cooler days, their soups are great and do not skimp on portion.  Atmosphere: Not the biggest place but it is pretty comfortable even during tour bus time (see above). There are modest decorations and decorum that give it a nice ambiance.  Service:  Overall, service is decent. Food is served relatively fast. However, getting your server's attention can sometimes be difficult, especially when it's busy. Some might think this is enough to knock the rating down to a 4 or 3...but not me. While it isn't the most friendly staff in the world (mostly due to the language barrier making conversation difficult) they are never rude and, when you finally do get their attention, they do respond fast.   Overall, this remains my favorite Chinese restaurant.",

    "text": "I do not know what I would do without Yelp!  How would ever I find this hidden gem on my own?   Walked up to the cold counter, picked three items for a plate and was helped by the owner, Ivy.  Tried the fried tofu, garlic cukes and a chinese Kim Chee (wrong word but you get the idea).  Wifeypie and I were dripping from the Kim Chee and the tofu, and it got hotter when we stopped eating it!  Ivy then came over to the table, inquired if we had been to the restaurant before and then proceeded to help us order, we had not a clue.  This smiling cheerful woman was a pleasure to share some time with.  We ordered the number 1 rice noodle soup and number 55, Deep Fried Fish Filet Sauteed w/ Spicy Sauce.  The soup was very good, the fish was one of the best fish dishes I have ever had, SPECTACULAR!    After we ordered, Ivy brought over another plate from the cold cart, with dried fish with chili and peanuts, pork and beef tendon (I am guessing it was tendon from the texture) and seaweed salad.  Again, it was all delish!  This was her gift for us!  I hope this place stays True to its roots in the future, we will definitely be coming back here on future trips to visit our money in LV!  Thank you Yelp, thank you Ivy, and thank you whatsherface for picking Yun Nan Garden for lunch today!  ;-)",

This is right beside Chengdu Taste, which is busier and, IMO, better. But beyond the peculiar pricing, I don't really have much complaints about this place.",

I always get the dan dan noodles and request for the noodles to be al dente as I like a bite to it. All the noodle dishes they use, use the same noodles however this is the third or fourth time that when I requested my noodles to be al dente it came out soggy, not to mention the owner coming out and giving our table a nasty look. Portion sizes have gotten smaller and more expensive and the service is really disappointing now. All three waitresses don't help with getting take out boxes and were busy on their phones. As much as I love this place, I don't think I will be back considering how downhill the food and service has gone down.",

    "text": "We ordered the Beijing yogurt in a ceramic container which cost 6 dollars and it tasted not a lot of difference compared to the yogurt in the plastic container($3). but the container was kinda cute.  For main dishes we ordered the rice noodle, chongqing spicy chicken and the spicy \"mini\" lamb chop. the rice noodle was out first, it was literally under 1 minute and it's ready. of course they pre-made the food but I understand maybe they were too busy on a slow Monday night. the chicken was horrible, seasoning was good but the chicken was dry and too much breading. and then here's the \"mini\" lamb chop only about 13 pieces in the plate, almost every lamb chop had no meat on them. just like the chicken, same seasoning and lots of breading. what a rip off, both of the dishes priced 15 dollars! oh yeah they also charge for steamed rice, does not come with the dish.  The waitress was great at the beginning, helping us order and explaining the menu. but after serve all the food, she just standing there and talking with her coworkers, never asked us if everything was okay or refills.  And just when we think we can at least take the yogurt container home and maybe grow some plants in it. they said we can not take it home, unless you pay 3 dollar extra to buy it. because they're gonna REUSE it. excuse me? I checked the brand and expired date on the paper that covered the container. so i don't know if it was fake or what. but the yogurt inside might be expired. so for you and your family's safety. DO NOT VISIT THIS PLACE  Ratings Resturant. 3/5  Server. 2.5/5 Rice Noodle 4/5 Spicy Chicken 0.5/5 Lamb Chop 0/5 Yogurt. haha what a joke  , ",

The green beans with minced meat was good but again, overpriced at 9.99.  The dandan noodles were tasty, spicy and appropriately priced at 6.99. Our last dish was a cold sliced pork dish that was small for the 12.99 price tag.  They even charge for white rice which is a sin considering the cost per dish.    The place was clean and appeared to be properly maintained.   The doors facing West are annoying at 6pm as every time it opens we got a face full of sun and heat.    The staff got the job done but spent their time between customers dashing to the lockers.  They were either snagging food to munch on or checking their cell phones.  After the 10th time this one server checked her phone, I thought she was playing Pokemon Go or something.    All in all, the food was passable albeit overpriced.  The restaurant itself is small but clean.  The service was sub-par at best.   With all of the great places to eat in Vegas, we won't be back.....there are better Szechwan offerings.",

Initially wanted to go to Sichuan Taste next door, but given it was SO crowded, loud, and had a long line, we decided to just go to this place next door. It was less crowded and quieter. Service was prompt and we ordered fried rice, beef noodle soup, 3 ingredient stir fry (you pick), and 3 cold dish sides for $6.99. The stir fry was kind of boring but everything else was so phenomenal! The fried rice was fluffy and had tons of flavors and ingredients. They were able to achieve this without drowning the rice with soy sauce! The noodle was decently chewy and the broth was absolutely delicious - tons of umami flavors and probably a lot of MSG - my boyfriend and I finished every drop. The beef wasn't too tender and was weirdly chewy though. The cold dishes were all flavorful and a bit spicy, Sichuan style. Super cheap and wish we had gotten another plate with 3 more cold dishes!",

    "text": "Came back here after a year of two later.   Got the boiled fish drowned in chili oil and spices. Satisfied my craving here. Not overly too mala spicy that u can't feel your tongue. Just enough numb for this dish. I did have to scoop out the fish from it's oily bath to drain it out a bit before eating.   Had a weird craving for bitter melon and can never say no to eggs so when I saw it offered on one dish, I couldn't say no. Unfortunately I was disappointed. The bitter melon was a tad bit too salty as if they purposely did it to mask the bitterness of the melon. The egg was almost unnecessary because I couldn't taste it.   Spicy wonton was just ok. Felt like all the dishes I got were too similar in taste that this one missed its spot light.   String beans were ok too. Wish it was fried a little more to give it a little crisp. The texture was just bleh.   Good spot to go if you're sick of the Las Vegas scene and want to fill your belly up with some Asia food but I probably won't be craving these any time soon.",

The best dishes we ordered at Yun Nan:  Mapo Tofu Dan Dan Mien Salt and Pepper Shrimp  The mapo tofu was one of the best I've ever had, great flavor, perfectly spicy and just great dish here.  The Dan Dan Mien was also delicious with sesame paste, pork, and noodles.  The salt and pepper shrimp was very addicting...we ordered two plates of all three dishes.  This place is great for large groups, service is friendly, and is one of the best cheap eats in Vegas.",

For two, an order of their Eggplant in Spicy Sauce and House Style Spicy Lamb was enough for two meals. Now, I don't mean for it to sound like throwing an abundance of food on a plate makes it good. There are plenty of restaurants where it is quite the opposite. Not at Yun Nan Garden though.   My friend and I were both pleased with our meal. All the veggies maintained and kept their textural integrity. The lamb was tender and kept it's promise of heat. The eggplant was oily, but the flavor was complex. It was not spicy and made me think that they gave us the Eggplant in Garlic Sauce. Either way, I loved the meal.   They do not have any lunch specials, but the prices are low. Most dishes hover around $7-$12. Our bill came to $22 before tip. For two meals, I would say that is a win.",

    "text": "Since last night was my fourth visit to Yun Nan Garden I suppose it is time for a review.  This may be my very favorite Chinese Restaurant.  One of their signature dishes is a famous noodle called Crossing Bridge Rice Noodle that is named from a famous legend of a woman who walked a long distance crossing a bridge to bring her husband lunch and discovered a way to keep the broth warm and cook the noodles and thin meats to have the dish taste fresh when she served it to him.  As soon as you are assigned a table go to the appetizer counter and select three items which they will put on a plate for you.  I highly recommend the baked tofu, chopped pickled long beans, and peanuts with dried fish.  Don't worry about the spice, my friend with the delicate palate was fine.  For entrees stick with food from the Sichuan or Yunnan region.  These are their specialties.  Be prepared for flavors you have never experienced.  This is a must in Las Vegas, even if it does mean you have to get in a cab and leave the strip.  If you go for dinner, the prices will more than compensate for the cab ride.",

This rice noodle soup did not strike me as being that special.  It just wasn't that particularly flavorful...but everyone else around us had a bowl, and they seemed to enjoy it.  Next we had the soft tofu with fish in szechuan sauce.  I enjoyed it...I'd say the intensity is dulled a bit, but the flavor is still there.  This dish was an enjoyable departure from our usual fish in chili broth.  I think my favorite dish though was a completely non spicy dish:  bitter melon with eggs.  In Yun Nan's version, they stir fried the egg separately with the bitter melon.  The melon was not overly bitter, and so very palatable.  Our second noodle dish was the cold noodles in szechuan sauce (?)...nothing really special, though the noodles were very chewy.  Next time I will try the dan dan noodles.  The service was very prompt with all the dishes coming out rather quickly and at once.  The ambience and location were nothing to note, but the food is good enough for us to return in the future.",

    "text": "After beginning our recent dinner at a nearby restaurant and knowing that we were going to leave unfulfilled, The Husband and I suggested Yun Nan Garden to our friend who is always curious to try something new.  * Boiled Beef with Szechuan Sauce ($9.25) - We knew we wanted something with their specialty sauce, and we've ordered this dish twice before.  It's always been a winner, so why not go for it again.  * Bean Curd Fish with Szechuan Special Spicy Sauce ($9.25) - We asked for a recommendation for fish, and the waiter suggested this one.  It has a very similar sauce as the beef dish, but it also has peanuts in it too.  Loads of spice again!  * Home Style Potato ($7.85) - We wanted a potato dish and thought it was the same one we've ordered before where the potatoes are cut into strips and stir-fried.  This dish is different since the potatoes are sliced and boiled, it sits in a chicken broth with jalapenos.  It was good, especially against all the heat from the other dishes, but we wished we had gotten the other potato dish instead.  When you eat at Yun Nan Garden, you have to be prepared for the heat.  Our friend said he liked spicy, but had no idea it was going to be this spicy!  Bring on the water and tissues!  And for anyone hoping to skip the rice, impossible here because you need the white base to slop all the spicy goodness to slurp up!  Service was better this time.  A male waiter seated us and took our order.  Another girl brought our food, beverages, and our check over.  We had minimal contact with the wait staff this time, so maybe that worked in our favor.  We had plenty of leftovers from the two spicy dishes, but then it  might be because our friend couldn't handle the heat! Haha!  3.5 stars.",

    "text": "I'm still breathing flames, feeling chest hairs sprout, and honestly dreading what morning will bring, the food was that spicy...not all of it, but what was spicy, was hellish.  Tonight was a personal (read party of 3 with husband, mother and me) at Yun Nan Garden.  I did my homework and citysearched it, too -- finding a website that gave me the menu (so I thought) and I'd even made a list of dishes we were absolutely going to order...and while it did give me a quick introduction to Yun Nan province cooking, it wasn't the same restaurant.    We ordered five dishes -- Szechuan Style Cold Noodles, Chongqing Spicy Chicken (no relation to ChunKing, but I'm sure this is where that mess of a name is derived...), Potato with Sour Sauce, String Beans with Chinese sausage and Yunnan Style Dried Beef.    The place is tiny -- about 15 tables, and it's actually quite attractive.  There's a small display case on the north wall, in front of the kitchen -- and that's where those side dishes (see pics) of pigs ear, tripe, chicken feet, chukka seaweed all live...  The food came out fast and furious.  There was only one other table of Caucasians in the room -- we were eyed with what felt like suspicion since it's located on the back side of the third building in the same center that houses PKL...  We dug into the noodles first -- they needed to sit -- and be stirred lots -- because the best bites are at the bottom where they've had a chance to soak up that incredible sauce -- don't think peanut butter -- this is the real thing -- light, perfect for hot Vegas weather.  The dried beef was hot, but not incendiary if you avoided the dried red chili peppers -- flavor is great, but it's sliced thin, so it's not really jerky like (say like LOS), think shit on a shingle kind of dried beef -- and I happen to like that, so this was good.   The potatoes were astounding -- although we're pretty sure it's mountain yam, not really potato.  I saw it on another guest's table, and it was terrific.    The string beans had nothing that resembled sausage -- it was pork belly and since bacon's our favorite vegetable, it was great.  The chicken -- at first I thought our server was just humoring us, then she said \"really, it's my favorite\" -- and smiled...so we were in.  You know those little dried red chilies you avoid when you see them whole in \"spicy dishes\" -- imagine taking oh, about a pound and chopping them up like scallions -- in other words, kinda hard to pick out, and mix that up with chicken pieces so tiny, it's hard to tell if it's in fact chicken (tasted more like pork rinds -- again, not really a problem for us...).  We soldiered through it, then after about a gallon of water, decided we'd try to pick out the chicken which now was about as hot as the chilies...  by this time the noodles were all happy, as were we...even though our concerns about tomorrow morning started to gel.  We sat for a while watching other tables eating -- mopping their brows -- and checking out their dishes... the fried salt and pepper fish looked phenomenal, as did the tofu dishes.  Our server also recd a fish with garlic sauce...  The menu is seriously fascinating -- I guess I've lived a sheltered life -- and I thought I'd been adventurous, but I've not seen a menu like this in America ever -- eel rice, spicy pork intestine, spicy frog, cold kidney, stir fried eel with pickled pepper, fat pork with garlic, black sea cucumber, chicken's intestine, pork leg skin...  This is some serious adventurous eating folks -- tonight, I took baby steps...   We went to Red Mango for relief...and I made a note to go back again.  p.s. I'd have killed for a cold beer -- but they don't have a liquor license.",

It was packed and we grabbed the last available table.  We surveyed the offerings on the cold buffet (3 for $4.50) and chose the pig ears, the beef tongue and chicken feet.  A very generous portion and all were delicious.   For our mains, we had the \"Boiled Beef and Fish in Szechuan Sauce,\" which is actually the classic Szechuan hot pot and an order of Dan Dan Mien (spicy noodles with ground meat).  We ordered both with maximum heat and they were both pretty spicy and absolutely delicious.   Everyone in the restaurant was speaking Mandarin and all of the staff and 99% of the customers were obviously Chinese from the PRC.  This is no Taiwanese or Hong Kongese upscale dining experience.  It's an authentic PRC chow hall.  It was extremely loud and lively and pretty much exactly like being in this class of restaurant in China.  Szechuan is my favorite province in China and although the food wasn't  quite up to what you'd get in Szechuan it was a pretty damn good facsimile.  We didn't bring our own beer but half the other tables did and I'd advise you to do the same.",

I ordered Mongolian beef and was given Onion beef for $14.99! Didn't want to argue the price since I've always liked the restaurant. Everytime were in Vegas we get good here but what a disappointment. I was gonna give them a chance if the food tasted the same but it didnt. I think the prices for the food we got were outrageous. I don't think we'll order from here again.",

Upon sitting down, the waitress came over and waited at our table for us to decide on a dish, little weird but ok. I chose the Kung Pao Shrimp and my friend chose the Yunnan Style Dried Beef. What came out was shrimp in a pile of oil and my friends dish was even worse. It tasted like beef jerky from a 7-11, and it resembled Shit on a Shingle. $11.99 for each dish and PLUS they charge you for rice $3 extra. I didn't think my shrimp was spicy at all. My friend couldn't finish her plate is was so salty. Then the waitress comes back around with our bill and stands there until we pay. This situation was bizarre. Too many other places in Chinatown to ever give this place a second try.",

If you can wait, you can drive to 99 ranch to buy it afterward. Its only $1.39",

    "text": "3.75 stars for now. I had a few dishes I didn't like but I'm addicted to the ones I liked.  I took 4 tums today and my stomach (and anus) is still on fire. This was my first experience with Szechuan food and by the end of dinner I concluded that I liked it. I also learned that (1) I should bring a Chinese friend and (2) should order non-spicy items to balance out the meal.   Our group of four ordered 8 dishes + appetizer and I ordered 4 of them (fatty, I know!).   1. Fish fillet and tofu in spicy soup - Tasted like fire. I love spicy but not when there is no flavor to it but fire. Didn't even take the left overs home.  2. Fish fillet in house special sauce - Spicy but flavorful! This plate is HUGE. I think it's about 4 servings.  3. Pork spare ribs - Sweet, spicy, crunchy, fried, fatty! This was one of my favorite dishes. Must try! Be careful of the small pieces of bone though.  4. Chicken with onions - A Chinese dish you can find at Panda (but superior). Enjoyed it even though it was mild! And the onions were sauteed perfectly.  5. Dumplings (spicy) - Mediocre, I wouldn't get it again.  6. Lamb (spicy) - I liked it. The flavors tasted to the Beef dry pot. The only difference was the lamb has more of a distinguished taste.   7. Beef dry pot (spicy) - I liked this dish because it incorporated vegetables but IMO it looked better than it tasted.  8. #1 noodles in egg soup - The waitress recommended this noodle this as their most popular one. It's not spicy (which is fine) but the soup was somewhat bland. One of my friends used the soup to rinse off spice from the other dishes. Even though I didn't love the soup, I'm willing to try a different noodle dish because quality of the noodles were pretty spectacular.   9. Appetizer - Cold items: Tofu, Seaweed, and Beef. Out of the three, the tofu was the best. It was thinly sliced with nice salty taste. The beef resembled very thinly sliced beef jerky. It was good but it wasn't so memorable. The strings of seaweed reminded me of a Korean side dish. To be honest I'm biased because I don't really like the Korean version of the seaweed so obviously I didn't really like the Chinese version either.",

    "text": "For my first review of 2009 I really wanted to find a 5 star place but I guess this one will have to do! It's hard finding 5 star places anyway so a 4 star review is just as good I'll say.  For some odd reason, everywhere else besides Orange County seems to be able to get Yunnan/Sichuanese food right. San Diego has awesome Sichuan cuisine and now we've found something in Vegas as well.  We decided to try this place out after reading the reviews and I'll have to say, yelp didn't lead us astray!  We started off with the appetizer buffet station where we got the ma la sliced beef and the tendon. I saw this table with a plate full of chilis so I asked the waitress what it was. She told me it was the 'spicy chicken'-- la zi ji. We got that cuz I wanted something super spicy. Then we got a dish for the young man, dried tofu with Chinese chives. I also like 'mi xien' a Yunnan speciality. Sichuan province and Yunnan province border each other so the food is similar --spicy as hell, mostly, featuring the Sichuan peppercorn.  The la zi ji kicked my ass! I mean I can eat spicy foods -- ie habanero -- but man this spicy chicken was super spicy. Maybe because the entire dish was filled with dried chilis -- about 70% chilis to 30% chicken. I was glad I ordered the other stuff which contained no chilis to balance out our palate.  When your mouth is in flames, take a few bites of the mi xien and drink a few sips of the broth. It really calms your mouth down.  All in all, a really nice meal. The gals there were sweet and came around many times to make sure we were enjoying our meal. I would definitely come back here again!!",

Bean Sprouts with various vegetables: Stir fried pretty well. It wasn't overly done but can still taste the oil and heat from the wok. Got to have some vegetables with all that meat.  Service was good. There was enough waiters and waitresses to help with all the tables.  The restaurant is in a plaza so the amount of space they have isn't large.

It's an impressive sight to see a group of Asians, not one over 5 foot six, demolish 30 some plates in less than a couple hours. Coney Island All American hot dog eating contest, here we come!  For appetizers the pig ear disappeared in seconds and the tofu slices were second. For main dishes I highly recommend the Mapo tofu: the tofu was soft and silky and the dish got the flavors right. Also good is their stir fried kidney (sounds strange but walk on the wild side!), tasted fresh with a consistency between squid and bamboo shoot. Lastly their home brewed chicken soup finishes off a dinner that set your tastebuds on fire.",

We got the cumin lamb and spicy/sour rice noodles - both were oily and the meat was quite fatty, so we found ourselves overwhelmed by the grease very quickly. However, the Yunnan noodles (first item on the menu) were delicious. The broth is delicate enough to really let the texture of noodles come through, and is definitely still flavorful without flooding your mouth with MSG. The 3 cold dishes for $6 were also a hit.",

We absolutely wanted the lamb in spicy dry pot, and I convinced him to try potatoes with green pepper, and we also wanted eggplant.  We tried to order eggplant in spicy paste a few times, but the waitress just said \"garlic sauce.\"  She asked if we liked spicy and oh yes, we do!  The lamb pot had schezuan peppercorns which coated my mouth and tongue with a numbing sensation, and the jalepenos in the dishes were fresh (mmm), and it was very tasty.  We got complementary hot tea but no water.  The spice was legit but we survived nicely!  The food came out very fast, the waitress spoke English, and it seemed very authentic.  I thought it was a cool place to try out and would give it a go again (Derek eyed the non-spicy smoked duck on the menu). See pics!!!",

My family is from Yunnan, and while I would say this is not necessarily authentic Yunnan cuisine (I would say that it's difficult to find authentic Yunnan food in China aside from the actual province itself), it is the best spicy food restaurant in Las Vegas (and most likely in the state of Nevada). If you're in Las Vegas and are looking for some authentic Chinese cuisine, definitely come here!   The reason why I do not give it a full 5 stars is because of the service. Just remember that while it might seem like the servers are rude, they aren't. It's just the way it is. This restaurant gets crowded really easily so you should try to avoid the popular hours of lunch and dinner. Either arrive a little earlier or a lot later. They have a new system in place where you grab a number and wait outside.  To the left of the entrance is a bar with some cold dishes. Definitely grab some for the table to snack on while you wait for your order to be taken and for the food to come out. All the dishes were flavorful (though some were a bit oily... so if you're watching your grease intake, be wary :P) -   -Definitely try Yunnan Rice Noodle Soup (guo qiao mi xian) - a well known Yunnan dish (the dish here is lacking in the soup, but there aren't many places in the US that get this dish right)  -Some other great dishes to try out - Boiled Fish with Sichuan Special Sauce; Szechuan style spicy lamb chop; Pork with chinese celery and green pepper; Stir-fried pork intestines with pickled pepper; Lamb with cumin",

    "text": "Yun Nan Garden could be an intimidating place for many people, thanks to its slightly hidden location and a menu that's not going to be familiar to those whose experience of Chinese food doesn't go much beyond Panda Express and General Tso. But Yun Nan Garden holds some of the best Chinese food in Las Vegas, and is well worth venturing out of your comfor zone for.   The atmosphere really isn't anything to speak of, it's pretty typical Chinese restaurant stuff. Booze is, as far as I know, limited to cans of Budweiser. But you're here for the food, and really not much else. There are a few standard Chinese dishes on the menu, but go for the Sichuan/Yunnanese dishes. I recommend: - Chonqqinq chicken - this is my favorite. It's a pile of small pieces of deep-fried chicken served in a mound of Sichuan peppercorns and dried chilies. It's hot: you notice the kick with your first bite, but it's not too bad. Then your lips start to tingle and numb from the peppercorns, then your mouth catches fire from the chilies, delivering a satisfying burn and great flavor. - Dan dan noodles - a standby of Sichuan cuisine, with ground pork, preserved vegetables and chili oil over noodles. - Pea shoots sauteed in garlic - a nice change of pace from the heat and complex flavors of other dishes.  Prices are excellent, most dishes are $10-12 or under. One warning, though: it's not the best place for vegetarians, or even pescatarians. There's meat and poultry lurking in a lot of the dishes. But all in all, it's a star of Spring Mountain.",
