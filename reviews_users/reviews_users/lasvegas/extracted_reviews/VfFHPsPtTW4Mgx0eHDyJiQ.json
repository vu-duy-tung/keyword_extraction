Service was quick and our table actually had 3 servers take our orders/serve our food/check on us.  Well drink was $3, like the price and value there. Also enjoyed their chili fries, chicken sliders and chips and salsa. Just a personal thing, I really don't think that any restaurant should charge for chips and salsa but I will give these guys a pass as the salsa was pretty good. Definitely going back to spend a little more time to feel the vibe. Also looking forward to hanging at the patio when the weather warms up. As a former Agave patron, I am happy to see a cool place in this beautiful space.",

Summerlin has been lacking a solid bar that isn't over the top and doesn't feel like a den full of local drunks... this place is the sweet spot.  The inside of the bar is comfortable and inviting. There is a separate dining area for those that don't want to hang around the bar. The patio has a variety of seating options and a mister system which makes sitting outdoors relatively nice in the evenings.  The wait staff, bartenders, and the manager Dan make this place a standout. The bar is staffed with good people and it shows. Overall vibe of this place is excellent.  I've noticed that the crowd that comes here is mixed with both older and younger people. A lot of casino industry people come here and love it. Everyone gets along and great conversations are the norm.  This is now my \"go to\" bar. I will continue to go to Distill with my wife, family, and friends.",

    "text": "I have been to Distill twice. Both times we sat at the bar.  The first with a girlfriend who happens to like margarita's.  The bartender greeted us and introduced himself, then gave us the \"Happy Hour\" menu, which consisted of 3 house wines, limited cocktails and VERY limited food (chips and salsa at a discount, WOW!) The bartender convinced my friend to try their famous fresh squeezed margarita at the cost of $10. (Not on the Happy Hour menu).  The drink was so tart and bitter she could not drink it.  The bartender replaced the drink with a glass of wine and charged us for both!  The second time, I took my dad who loves a good hang out bar.  The bartender again greeted us, introduced himelf, shook our hands then promptly disappeared never to be seen again.  It took us 10 minutes for the next bartender to see that we did not have any drinks and ask what we would like.  For happy hour they offer draft beers for $3.  My dad ordered one and instead of the bartender asking, \"Would you like a large one for an additional $1.25?\" brought him a large one.  We did order an appetizer, but since the \"Happy Hour\" menu is so limited, we ordered the Calamari off of the regular menu.  It is very good, served with a mango/sirracha sauce for dipping.  We asked for a little extra sauce and then found that we were charged for it!  You don't always get what you pay for and at Distill, you pay for everything!!",

This place is loud, at least the night we went. Had to literally scream to talk type of place.   The food wasn't that great, at all really. It was either too hot or too cold and just generally didn't taste the greatest. The only good thing to eat here was the dessert.   And the reviews about the service are True. I think we only saw our waitress a total of 3 times, that's it. And that was only to quickly drop off the food. I had to literally wait for some other guests to leave their table so I could steal the ketchup bottle because I know there was no chance anyone was coming back to ask us how we were doing.

Prizes for the first 100 people!\"  I really didn't think we'd be in that coveted swag group even though we got there at 6:40. But seeing that Distill was re-distilling in the space occupied by the late, lamented Agave Restaurant, a cavernous place, we didn't expect to be fighting for wall space. How'd this happen?  They opened at 4:30!  What happened to truth in advertising??  They did have a buffet station set up, with pizza, round potato bites, beef strips and all the fixings for fajitas, chicken & artichoke dip, bruschetta, and jumbo shrimp for shrimp cocktail. The fajitas were very good, the potato puffs were delicious, but the rest was just okay.   Finally we snagged a booth, and except for the demo girls handing out Royal Crown & Jack Daniels' Tennessee Honey samples & some cute t-shirts, we couldn't snag a server even to clear the table, let alone slake our parched palates. Servers are also bussers, which didn't help speed things up. And the bar was backed up with drink orders. They definitely could benefit from a second bar.   We did manage to fill up on the free offerings, so I'll reserve my food critique until next time. We checked out the menu, with its standard assortment of appetizers, salads, burgers, and sandwiches, and prices are pretty reasonable. But the Happy Hour (3-6 pm and 3-6 am - catering to early joggers?) menu is completely unimaginative and eminently skippable.   I'll update my review and impressions of the food after all the excitement dies down (and hopefully the noise - this place is jet-takeoff LOUD!!!!!), but my initial impressions are just ho-hum.",

I honestly don't know why they have a pool table when all the sticks are broken and neither table has a pool rack. So I went and watched a game at a table. The first chair I sat in had a small tear, thankfully there was another nearby which didn't have the same problem.  The bartenders were alright, but they are nothing to write home about and they seemed to be always rushing. I never felt like anything other than another guy in seat, especially after I went through $20.00 in a machine at the bar and got asked, \"are you still playing?\" I answered, \"not right now,\" and immediately got asked to move down.  I get it the machines are reserved for players, hence the placard on them. But it hadn't even been more than five minutes since I blew that $20.00. I finished my beer and left. Maybe one day this place will be alright, I'm just not holding my breath any more.",

    "text": "On New Year's Day we just had to watch my Green Bay Packers with lots of folks, knowing there would be enough fans at Distill.  The best part of this great sports bar/restaurant (besides the food) are the big cushy leather chairs & sofas, enough space between others, the just-right lighting, and the greeting one always receives from a terrific staff.  I recommend Angela, our server for the few hours, who goes the extra mile & does it with a fun personality (as though she loves her job).    The menus are vast & include:  football day menu, happy hour menu & B/L/D.  Wanting to begin my take-off-a-few-pounds resolution, I chose the fish & chips, & was I a happy camper!  Three sizeable, lightly-breaded in beer batter fillets served with lots of good fries (I gave to my partner), coleslaw and a salad  of gourmet greens (or clam chowder) for $13.25.  He had the steak nachos from football menu & they were plenty, being generous with the steak portion.  And not too gooey.  Your choices on that menu are terrific, incl. generous & attractively plated fish tacos.  The music that night (we asked for the game \"noise\" instead) was for anyone's taste; a nice departure from the usual screams of Brittany Spear types.  The prices are righteous on all menus, and after 3 yrs. of stopping by-- in good weather a favorite patio of mine for dining-- I've not had a mediocre meal.  Kudos to Distill !",

    "text": "LOUD!  TOO LOUD!!  My guy and I came here with another couple because our friends have been wanting to check out this \"local bar\".  The music was so loud, that we had to speak in raised voices the entire time we were there and STILL could barely hear each other. Clearly, everyone else in the place had a hard time hearing each other as well. Most of the people were leaning in to talk/yell to/at each other. All those people yelling over the unnecessarily loud music just makes the entire bar/restaurant even noisier.   We sat at a nice four top, which was clean and were greeted very quickly. Our poor waitress was very sweet and smiled a lot as she yelled \"HI CAN I START YOU OFF WITH A DRINK?!?!\"  I had the \"Mad Mule\", a specialty house cocktail. (Citron vodka, mixed with \"fresh lime juice\", simple syrup, orange bitters, and ginger beer.)  With this kind of ingredient list this cocktail should be awesome, but it was just ok. I will have to try something else if we ever go back.   Distill has a big variety of sliders to try, but we went with something simple. The \"Bacon Cheese Burger sliders\". Sadly, not much to write about, they were just average.  The best thing we had all night were the \"Mashed Potato Bites\". They take mashed potatoes and mix them with cheddar, pepper jack and parmesan cheeses then add a \"blend of spices\". They roll them into bite sized balls, then bread crumbs and fry them. I recommend trying those if you eat here.    I'm giving our server 5 stars as she somehow got our order completely correct over all the noise. She was attentive, smiling, easily split the check for us between two cards AND said \"I HOPE TO SEE YOU AGAIN!!\"  Maybe...maybe not.",

The bartender actually got very friendly while I was ordering and we were on a first name basis after just a few minutes.  They have some sofas for lounging and drinking, as well as tables for traditional eating.  They make a good mix drink and their beer selection is actually quite good for a local bar.  Their prices are on par with most other bars in the area.  I enjoyed myself at Distill.    My main problem was that they double charged me on a beer I ordered.  It took three separate calls for me to get the charge removed. I would possibly come back to hang and try some appetizers when I'm in the area, but there are so many good restaurants in the Summerlin area that I might just make Distill my local watering hole and use it as a pre/post dinner stop rather than the full evening experience.",

There is no separate room for smoking so even though we were sitting quite a distance away from the bar I could still smell the smoke enough to make it my last visit.  I'm not sure how they get away with allowing smoking in a restaurant as there are laws in NV regarding the topic.  Food and service get five stars.  Smoking allowed inside the restaurant gets a 0.  Limit smoking to outside on the patio and I would be back.",

Although the food and service did not blow me away or make a lasting impression, I will say that the ambiance and atmosphere is lively and fun.   Single ladies *side note* if you're looking for a MAN this would be the place to go, it's like a MAN cave in there! Lots of MEN Haha. Well in all seriousness we came here for a going away get-together a group about 7 to 10 people.   We sat outside and loved the feel of it next to the fire pits they had. Almost everyone of us ordered drinks and either an appetizer of some sort or entree and shared so when I say the food was just \"ok\" my credibility comes from that of being able to taste plenty of dishes.   Our server was not the most friendly but not the worst either, but I'd imagine working at an upbeat trendy place like Distill She'd have a bit more of an outgoing personality or serve up at least a few smiles here and there but no luck. All in all a great place to grab drinks and have a good time with friends but not the first place I'd choose to satisfy any cravings but in the end it is called \"Distill-a Local Bar\" rather than \"Distill, a five star restaurant.\"",

She introduced the happy hour menu which consists of small bites and well drinks. Well worth it since me and my friends weren't in dire need of a full blown meal or fancy cocktails. Service was awesome. Music ambiance was mellow. We met Channel and Rick during shift change I guess, and I have to say, WOW. Quite the family atmosphere. These two are loved and I totally see why.

Food was stale and looked like frozen reheated stuff. The best part is That food gave me and my girlfriend food poisoning.... So if u want to clean yourself out and impress your girlfriend by making her run to the bathroom 10 times in one night I highly recommend it....",

We split the chipolte chicken nachos, the filet sliders,  tacos, and Greek fries. Everything was good. The Greek fries were okay but I have had better--there was no sauce so the meat and feta just fall off the fries. The nachos were really tasty!   They have a really cool patio that is decorated. We sat out there and our first waitress was SO nice! She had to leave so we got a different waitress. She made comments that we were too far away and made us feel uncomfortable. I am not sure if she was mad that we sat outside,  but there were others there when we got there.",

Walked in, somewhat loud for a weekday, seemed the music would get louder as the people would get louder.   Seated myself, was served by Sydney, who was really attentive and friendly. She made the experience enjoyable, even though it was a little busy she took a few minutes to chat.    I ordered the grilled chicken without the sauce  and chicken soup.    The soup of surprisingly really good for a bar.  It had a pretty good spice kick to it. The chicken was average, not being able to see what you're eating because of how dark it was in the bar was a little discouraging.  I'm not a sweet potato fan and there were a lot of them.  I was not able to make out the difference between normal potatoes and the sweet. The red peppers were mushy, but edible.  Overall the customer service from Syndey would bring me back with my friends or even again alone.   I would probably stick with a burger next time since the reviews are very high   Updated on July 27  Food 4 out of 5 Service 5 out of 5   So like always I need to try an eatery two times to make sure it was a valid review the first time   I walked in and instantly I was greeted by Kayla to took my drink order.  The sever, Sydney, from my earlier review was here and was up next   I Ordered the amazing chicken soup with the kick and it was like before amazing.  Ordered a burger with bacon this time and it was well prepared. Fresh bacon, Tomato, and lettuce.   While I was eating the bar back stopped to check on me to make sure all was good. The price for the Quality was better than the chicken.",

It has a somewhat elegant ambience about it, especially in the ladies room. It has two pool tables, why can't all bars have pool tables? The breakfast here is amazing! Whenever I'm craving breakfast I come here. I had to knock off a star because one time I came here in the early morning of New Year's Eve, and when it was time to pay my bill with my credit card, it took over an hour to get it back. I had to ask the bartender for it and start the process of paying for the bill all over again. It wasn't busy either, I mean there were only like 4 other people in the bar. During this waiting period another bar patron spilled my beer all over my machine and wanted to buy a replacement beer for me, and the bartender accused me of spilling it myself and made me pay for my own beer, despite someone else wanting to buy my drink. I left in a horrible mood that night. All the other bartenders rock though. Amy the marketing manager is just the sweetest person ever!",

There was a place to lock the bike outside the front door and it was safe out of view from the plaza's streets.  I've been here when it was a Mexican restaurant and the decorations have changed.  There's a lot of whiskey barrel type furniture with leather/vinyl coverings.  There are also a lot of decorative signs with funny sayings.  The room is quite dark until your eyes get adjusted.  There are a couple of spaces at the bar that have no video poked machines built in and I chose one of these paces.  Lelaine was the bar hop and she was there with my coffee quickly and a menu.  I ordered the Distill breakfast sandwich with sausage, eggs over easy, jack cheese, and English muffin.  You can get the sandwich with other cheeses, eggs cooked the way you want, biscuits or bread, and bacon or ham.  There are lots of choices.  The sandwich was brought with a nice helping of hash browns and my coffee was refilled.  The sandwich was a nice break from the normal omelette I get when I have breakfast out.  I enjoyed my stop here and I'll try it in the evening to have on of their burgers.  Good service and good food.",

Few things: 1) For yelpers, if you check in you get a free shot of their house whisky. Bad thing is, it's horrible. Cinnamon / orange infused. Pretty much tasted like Triaminic cold and cough. Pass on it, trust me. 2) The bathroom sinks...I can't stand these things. Whoever thought a slightly tilted slab of tile would work as a sink...dude, you were waaaay wrong. Give me a basin and save my clothing from the splash back and the whopping 2 inches of space to place my hands under, please.

I've tried most things on the menu and I can't think of anything I haven't liked. The wings are a personal favorite, or the 24 hour breakfast menu. They have a cool brunch menu on weekends as well, complete with a bloody mary bar. And plenty of TVs and seating to watch football with some decent drink and food specials.   Distill is definitely one of my favorite local places and I recommend it to friends regularly.",

My friend dropped a drink on accident and he could have easily refused to bring us another but it was still full and because the tables in the patio is so flimsy he was kind enough to remake it. I will be back in no time simply because of his service. We also ordered a chicken quesdilla and the chicken nachos. As well as a breakfast shot he recommended. Totally delicious if you don't want to taste the after taste.! Taste just like pancakes.",

    "text": "Today was my fourth visit....Eh... It's always a hit or miss when I come here. Four stars for the Tavern Atmosphere. It is really enjoyable and comforting here to hangout with friends or coworkers after the late night dinner shift. They have a comfortable patio too!  Unfortunately, there isn't much consistency with the drinks, however; I send my liquor back every time I visit or exchange it for wine (because you can't mess that up).  I had a pizza here almost a month ago; it was small for the \"large\" portion, but really tasty. However tonight, it was terrible [both the food and service]. Waitress was not very attentive either.  Overall, this place has potential if the staff and management get it together before downtown summerlin opens up in October. Otherwise, I could see this place closing up shop before 2015. May try again, but I won't suggest to distill to friends.",

A lot of the reviews said the food wasn't that great I noticed. My cheese pizza was really good other than the crust being a little bland. Nothing some Ranch couldn't fix. Our server was friendly and attentive too.  I loved their outdoor patio area. It was cool and rainy so we ended up going back inside but I bet it's a perfect place to enjoy some grub and drinks in the spring. Admittedly, coming from somewhere you can't smoke inside, the smell of cigarettes hanging in the air inside was a little off putting. Overall a cool place with a cool vibe if you're not expecting a Michelin-start experience and just want some basic food and drinks.",

Outdoors; boasts a rustic chic style with even more seating and fire places to create a nice ambiance. I often find myself looking up and wishing that my backyard could look like this.   The drinks are super affordable. The staff are around enough to get drinks, but not so much that they intrude on your conversation. I have never been hungry while here, but a couple of friends have ordered food before. It is nothing outright amazing, but definitely better than some of the chain bars.   Between the inexpensive cost of drinks and cool atmosphere, this is definitely a place I can see myself relaxing.",

    "text": "I've heard good things so we decided to do dinner here with a friend.   I dig the laidback vibe and decor, I love the quirky patio space! It was a bit hot this day so we stayed indoors. Just note this is a bar and is a smoking establishment but it was not smoky when we went. I will probably try to smoke a cigar on the patio one of these days.   Make sure to check in, there's a offer for a infused whiskey I didn't see until after we were finished and paid. D'oh!   We shared the shrimp artichoke spinach dip. The dip was really creamy and nicely seasoned. It only had a few shrimp on top and it really didn't need it. My philosophy is don't be skimpy as it gives a lesser impression than if it wasn't there at all. Just don't put it at all and offer more quantity of the dip as that was good and we had plenty of unused chips as we polished off the small dip quite fast.   I decided to get a black and bleu burger. This was a pretty good burger, not skimpy of the stinky cheese and I like the horseradish sauce though wish it had more kick vs just the flavor. Comes with a side of choice and I picked fries which was standard, but good. Our friend got the Cure burger and between the two, that was the definite winner. That was uber yummy so I took two bites instead of taking a small taste.   The fiance get fish and chips. This unfortunately was a bit of a miss. The batter had decent flavor and fish was good but it wasn't very crispy at all and should have been fried up longer. Whoever plated it, should have caught it and let it have a few more minutes. Slaw didn't have much flavor as it barely had any dressing on it. The fries were good.   The fish and chips was in the entree section of the menu which comes with a soup or salad. He chose a caesar salad which was actually pretty good caesar and was rather sizeable for a \"side salad\".   Our server was pretty friendly, and was reasonable with checking in on us and refilling.   While one entree was a miss, I think we will be back soon as we can see the potential. There is a industry half off happy hour on Weds. starting at 10pm so we will probably come back soon for that and I am definitely in for The Cure!",

My boyfriend and I decided to check this place out on Sunday evening.  It wasn't very crowded at all.  We were greeted and told we could sit wherever we wanted so we chose the patio.  On this visit we didn't really see much of the inside.  Happy Hour is every day from 3-6 but we missed that but checking in on Yelp got me a free drink so can't really beat that.  Off the appetizer menu we ordered the chicken quesadillas and avocado egg rolls.  Basic bar food but no complaints about taste or portion size.  I wish the tables outside were a little bigger.  We felt cramped eating having to use the small round table and a couple chairs to hold the times.  Not sure why the waitress didn't offer to move another small table for us since it was empty on the patio minus one other group of diners.  I know I will find myself back here soon especially during happy hour.  They also have a loyalty program.  I mean if you are going to frequent an establishment you might as well take advantage of the perks that go along with it.",

I didn't receive what I ordered but chose not to say anything and just pick through what I did want.

Ive been here several times mainly for sporting events and the seating they have in front of the tv's as if your watching comfortably at home, but with waitresses bringing you food you dont have to clean up the kitchen after!   The outdoor patio is nice on clear not so hot nights to enjoy the fireplaces and a good dessert and a drink. The interior is not bad either and the servers have always been super helpful and friendly. BUT my main gripe is the food, as its lacking in my opinion.   Had Fish tacos - Flavorless, even with a weird sauce they laid over them.  Sliders - Dried out meat, and just not dressed with anything special. Breakfast burrito w/sausage - The best thing i had which was just okay but nothing to write home about as how can you mess up eggs, and meat in a tortilla. Bread Pudding - YES! Do have especially if you dont like raisins like me.   All in all this place is an okay go to spot in Summerlin for the sporting events, and a bite but i wouldnt come too often as the menu is just kind of bland for me. Points are mainly for the service and outdoor patio area.",

    "text": "We were looking for a place to get a good burger on a Saturday night and I have seen the \"Cure\" burger mentioned many times so we decided to head on over. Overall, we were really underwhelmed..  First off, it is seat yourself anywhere, which is fine, but when you walk in, it really seems like a place that they would seat you, for the tables at least, so after standing there 5ish minutes and having several waitresses pass us by, we walked up to one to find out it was seat yourself...the lack of interest from any server was to be a theme for the evening.  We found a table and sat while several servers passed us by, easily a dozen times. No menus to look at, no drinks, just us sitting there, and (I would think) obviously looking like we needed menus. Server finally came over with menus, and then back about 5 seconds later to take drink orders. As I had literally just gotten the menu, I asked for \"a water to start\"   They did bring the water out pretty quickly and then cue the same dozen waitresses walking by while we sat for 15 minutes waiting to order. When the waitress arrived she actually asked \"Did you want to order some dinner?\" I was very tempted to say \"No, we just came for water\" She seemed surprised when we actually wanted drinks...at a bar....anyway, I could go on, but the rest of the evening was the same service wise. Waitress nowhere to be found, dinner took forever (although the man who dropped it off did apologize for the wait) and just feeling like we were almost inconveniencing the servers...it was very odd.   I could almost understand if it was meant to be more of an actual bar, but it is set up like a very large restaurant with tables everywhere, so it was just weird. I was tempted to just hit the bar myself and get my own drinks, but I kept playing the waitress must be coming over here any minute game, even though I could have gone to the bar and back 20 times in between visits from her.   Anyway, on to the food. Short story, everything was meh. Long story, we ordered mashed potato bite appetizers, very bland, almost no taste at all actually, and was only marginally helped by the sour creme sauce. Pretzel bites, again incredibly bland and no taste, and again only marginally helped by the mustard sauce.   The Cure burger which I have heard good things about was also fairly disappointing. It had some good flavor, but was probably the messiest burger I have ever had. Everything was dripping all over my hands and the plate below and sliding everywhere, resulting in bites of just burger or just sauce toppings. I finally gave up and ate it with a fork, which was 1. ridiculous, and 2. only worth it if it had been really good, and it wasn't. I edited to add that it did not have the fried parsnips in it either. I thought that was on the description, then thought I mixed it up with another burger, but I didn't and they were missing. Sweet potato fries that I ordered along with it were tasteless (sensing a theme on their fried items here) and the margarita (one of their $10 \"distill specials\")  was also just eh with a short pour for sure...definitely had better.  It's one of those places that had the service been top notch, it would have made up for the food, or if the food had been awesome, it would have made up for the service, but considering both were not good, it's not worth a return trip at all. Too many other places in Vegas doing it better.",

So essentially they would rather turn away business because I don't have a group they can auto-grat! My boyfriend and I went elsewhere and ordered up!

    "text": "Distill is a local bar located very close to my workplace. I've been in the area long enough to know that the building they occupy is where restaurant and bars go to die. I thought I'd give this place a few tries before reviewing since I've seen the building change hands from one establishment to another and wanted to give them an extra fair shake.   My first experience didn't leave a very good impression since my coworker and I walked into an almost empty building at lunch time and the wait staff was visibly hanging out while preparing place settings in one of the booths and one of the guys appeared like he was taking a nap. Distill has a decent-sized menu so I asked our server what she would recommend and she claimed everything was good. I ordered their street tacos and the chicken, unfortunately, had the taste and dryness of sawdust. My coworker seemed to enjoy his sliders so I thought that would be the play for my next visit.   I came back with a small group to celebrate with a coworker who was leaving the company. All the staff seemed awake -- big plus. This time, I ordered a variety of sliders. The philly slider was OK but not worth the calories. The western BBQ slider was like a dry hockey puck. The tiny country fried chicken slider which consisted of 40% bread, 30% mashed potatoes(inside the sandwich), 20% breading and 10% chicken was just inedible. It's probably just my luck that I ordered all the wrong food items. So much for the \"everything was good\" claim the initial server made.   On a positive note, when I returned to celebrate another coworker who was leaving (a recent trend), I realized this place seems like a nice place to just hang out for a few drinks and watch sports on their large TV screens. Sans food.",

The main thing that has me coming back is the atmosphere. Nice lighting and woodwork, flat screen tvs, couches, tables and an overall nice environment and crowd.",

I am not a steak connoisseur but if that qualifies as Filet Mignon, next time I'll just have the chicken please...  What was good was the Greek Fries. Just simple greek fries with feta cheese, slices of shawarma meat and tomatoes. This is something I expect from a bar like Distill, nothing extraordinary but everything you can expect when you crave fatty greek fries.  Please don't have items like the Filet Mignon Sliders on the menu only to leave us crestfallen. Leaves a bad taste in my mouth..literally.   Besides mediocre food, I love the outside atmosphere. Real nice if you want to get away from the noisy compounds of the interior, especially during a game night.   What's cool is that they offer a Football Menu during football games whether or not you're there to watch the game. My sorry Chargers aren't worthy to watch this year (last in the division, currently at 0-3) so I wasn't really there to watch football but glad to see an additional menu as an option.",

    "text": "All three stars go to the happy hour specials. They have good deals, decent bites, and it's a good place to go with friends when you just want to hang out and chill.  However, I had a sort of disturbing experience when it came to the service (aside from it being slow in general). I had gone with a girlfriend, both of us driving about 25 minutes to meet up here in Summerlin since it's a midpoint between both of our neighborhoods. We had been there ordering drinks consistently for 2 hours, then we decided to switch to water since we both had to drive. When we were ready to cash out, the bartender gave us a hard time! He kept saying things like, \"No, no... you're gonna order more.\" and LITERALLY: \"Wow, you girls are boring! What are you going to do, go home and take a nap?\" We politely explained that we had been there for two hours, and were being responsible by sobering up before driving home. He CONTINUED by egging us on with \"Well, that's what uber's for!\" and \"Yeah 2 hours is nothing, the night's just starting!\"  This really, deeply bothered me. As a bartender, I would hope that your conscious and wanting your patrons to get home safe would be a higher priority than more tips based on my drinking volume.",

They area really hasn't had a local bar scene (aside from those in the neighboring casinos) before and this place really adds convenience and ease when grabbing drinks with friends after work.    Their menu is pretty impressive.  It is a step up from your average bar food and has a very diverse selection (plus pancakes lovers rejoice, breakfast is available all day!)  My personal favorite item is the avocado eggs rolls.  They staff is pretty friendly.  Our server was relatively new so she was still getting into the swing of things, but you could tell she was trying so I won't judge too critically.   The interior decor is warm and inviting, and the patio layout is kind of fun.   The bathrooms, however, could use an update.   Overall, I enjoyed Distill, will be returning and would recommend to others.",

We seated ourselves on the patio to enjoy the sunshine. We were welcomed quickly by Erin and got our drinks in a flash.  We decided to order appetizers and settled on the mashed potato balls and homemade poppers.  The manager brought them out and introduced himself.  Bar food but really, really good!!! (try the poppers) We then ordered another round and a six pack of assorted sliders. They, like the appetizers were served diligently, quality ingredients, and tasted amazing. A free whiskey shot and full belly later, we  again spoke with Tony the manager and  although we are not \"local\", were made to feel extremely welcome.  We felt these people really care about the customer.  During our next  trip to the Red Rock, we will visit Distill again.",

However, the next day I had notifications of fraud from my banker. My card was charged an addition $650.00!! I did not leave a tab open and only used my card that one time. My account was frozen and informed me that the charge was from this establishment. Mistake or not that's a pretty dramatic amount to \"accidentally\" charge someones card. How could this have been authorized and overlooked? I attempted to email the contact listed on their site but it was invalid. Needless to say I wont be returning. Luckily my bank caught it.

I swear on the bible it was the best I've had! She needs to order it again. The street tacos were amazing, I wanted to lick the plate! Caesar salad was good...I might get the dressing on the side if you like it light but I loved it. The poppers are not traditional they are actual pieces of jalapeno with cream cheese and fried, hot and yummy.  For all these people that went opening night you need to give it another chance. I was very happy with the service, drinks and food. I will definitely be going back. One more thing...I did not smell any smoke and I'm super sensitive to that so I think they must have aired it out.",

I had to give him 0 tip and cash to the waitress whose area was not to service the bar. Stay away unless ur drunk and forgot the last time u saw a service tender was after u paid the bill to another server whose job was not to serve you. Sad. Mike should be doing better. This was my first time here in 4 years since it opened and I live across the street.. It's no wonder I never made it my hub or place to stay still or distill.

We came around midnight, and seated ourselves in kind of a dead area, so I was concerned that we might be overlooked, or that the server would take a while to get to us, but she was very attentive the whole time. Good pub food. Good portions. They're open 24/7 too.  Food:   Avocado Eggrolls - Not what we expected. The eggrolls were stuffed with a mushy guacamole, rather than avocado slices or chunks. It wasn't very enjoyable biting into a crunchy wrapper and having the filling squish into your mouth. Taste was meh, but the ginger dipping sauce was tasty. Wouldn't order this again.   Biscuits and Gravy - Standard, nothing special. Not great, not horrible. The sausage in the gravy was a nice touch. $3 price point doesn't hurt either.  Potato Nachos - Tasty. Exactly what it sounds like, slices of potato, fried, and topped with the normal nacho ingredients.   Calamari Straws with a Mango Curry Emulsion and Sriracha -My favorite of the bunch. The calamari was soft, and the sauce was interesting; just savory enough and just sweet enough for me. Ask for more on the side, because the drizzle on the plate isn't really enough.   Bread Pudding - Ok, but not great. Nice and buttery,  but too dense.   Overall a good experience, I'd come back some time for the calamari and to try out some other items.",

    "text": "I don't leave many yelp reviews, but something caught my eye this morning.  As I scroll through the reviews, I can't help but notice \"locals\" leaving mostly great comments, and a couple miserable people leaving obvious erroneous reviews.  Distill has always had exceptional service since they arrived.  My wife and I regularly have lunch at the Southwest location and have always been treated like Norm from Cheers!  (We feel very welcomed) Our dining experience at the Charleston location last night was no different. We were greeted by a young woman in a Vegas Strong hat, she said her name was Tracey. She was extraordinary and her service is noteworthy. Very charming and attentive! I mention the hat because it's such a classy move by Distill to let their employees remember our fallen friends from that horrible tragedy.  We will definitely be visiting this location weekly from now on.  I hope to never run into these miserable \"professional yelp reviewers\" who are obviously looking for free sh*+",

I've really only gone there to gamble and I wish I have had luck but the machines seem to be extremely tight.  Because it's so open it's extremely loud.    As far as food goes I've only tried the quesadillas and they were very average.  Service is decent but bartenders get lost when busy and takes a while to get a drink.  However the tall blonde is excellent and the curly haired brunette is also very good.  A few of the times I got fast friendly service from them.  Maybe I need to try more of their menu, but for the few times I have been there it is just kind of meh.",

    "text": "First time I came here was at the Yelp event that I purely enjoyed. Came here last night to see how it's like on a regular night. The vibe is very relaxed. The bar seemed pretty packed. But, You are able to sit yourself in the dining area. Someone automatically brings you a menu & lets us know our server will be with us.  Erin was our server for the night. We automatically checked into Yelp & redeemed our free whiskey shots. We also ordered Mad Mule $10 (which was served at the Yelp event) & a Cinnamon Apple Sour $7. Apple sour was on the sour side & extremely strong. The whiskey shots came in coffee & cinnamon flavored. Yuck! Those drinks did the job done alright!  For food: Shrimp Spinach Artichoke Dip $9.99 -- it was very very very very bland. It didn't have enough cheesiness. The shrimp didn't blend in well with the other ingredients. A lot of chips, not enough dip.  Street tacos $7.99 -- shredded chicken with usual contents that comes with a taco. It had a chipotle dressing on top. These were pretty good. Still, nothing that made me want to order it again.   New York Steak & Eggs $11.99 -- beau said it was good cooked perfect. It came with hash browns. & you can choose between English muffin or toast. I tasted it, tasted like regular steak  \\_()_/    French toast $7.99 -- beau also got French Toast (guess he was hungry). These were excellent. Probably best thing we ate last night. It was light and fluffy.   Erin, our server, was very attentive. She came and checked on us every so often. She was nice & had lots of personality. When asked if we can change the channel of the TV next to us she said she would but she never did, but we didn't make a big deal out of it. Other bummer, she charged us for our free \"yelp check in\" shots. Of course I told the beau to look at the itemized billing like I ALWAYS do & of course he said he did but really didn't (men!) and just signed his life away. Later I looked at the bill & we were charged for them *insert angry face*",

    "text": "One of our favorite places here in Summerlin. The food is decent, not a five star restaurant, but it is good overall. My particular favorite is the avocado egg rolls. You can't go wrong with it all.  The atmosphere is nice. There is a large bar in the center (good luck getting a seat - it's fairly busy) and plenty of seating even at its peak times. There is also a patio area that is relaxing and doesn't get too hot/cool.  Lastly, you have really good servers here. My friends and I have always had positive experiences with the staff here. Our particular favorite is Jade. She's very outgoing and helpful with whatever you need. The bartenders are also friendly and keep the drinks flowing.  Overall: a nice establishment with great staff.",

Guess it wasn't good enough for the bar tenders because they turned off my music.  When I asked the bartender what happened he lied and said that there's a girl that walks around the bar with a 3000 track list and she skips songs as she wishes.  I told him I should at least get my money back because I put $10 in to the machine.  His response was that he would tell her my issue next time he saw her.  After expressing concern... My playlist magically came back on.  This guy clearly thinks I'm an idiot and I don't appreciate it.  Overall, we have just been treated like pee ons.  Not cool bro. Not cool.",

I went for what I remembered as one of my top 2 favorite desserts in Vegas- the Distill Bread Pudding!   It's been about 9 months probably since I last had it but unfortunately, it was not much how I remember it! It was about 60% of the size it used to be. It used to be twice as tall. Today, it was about an inch thick vs. about 2 inches, was more chewy and not as fresh as in the past, and didn't have the caramelized nuts it used to have. So I have to say I was disappointed and it certainly was not the second favorite dessert I remembered it to be.   That being said, I still did enjoy the restaurant. That is the only food item that I had so I cannot comment on the other menu items. I still enjoy the atmosphere of the restaurant. Although smoky, it is cozy.   I sure hope they go back to their old ways as it relates to the bread pudding!",

Mike the bartender had the entire crowd engaged with his infectious personality, so much so that he had everyone there sing a rendition of \"Happy Birthday\" to one of the guests, while he was holding a dessert item w/a candle in it. He did a great job of giving us all our equal amount of attention, which was a nice change compared to some of the other bars I've frequented in the past where the bartenders only pay mind to their regulars. Not only will I continue to make this my late night spot of choice, but I'll be sure to spread the word that is Distill, and it's all because of Mike. Bravo sir, bravo!!",

Graveyard late night mostly but  today being July 3rd going into the holiday my friend and I decided to find a place with a nice patio and some good music. We found it at Distill Summerlin but that's where the fun stops. On this occasion and the one previous to this the service just absolutely sucked. Whether inside at the bar or outside it's just bad. It's real simple. Just waiting 15+ minutes to be served and having to go in and ask for service after the bartender said she'd send.the server out to us. By the time Cindy finally came out we were pretty thirsty so we downed our first beverages rather quickly. After having to wait another 15 minutes for another drink we paid our check and left.

    "text": "My expectations weren't low enough.   For a smokey dive bar, i was excited about outside seating. We were greeted enthusiastically and our waitress showed up soon after to take our order of a couple drinks.   now.. whenever i see beers on a menu i've never heard of, I like to ask about them. I like beer and i like trying beer. One might suggest that behavior likening to beer tasting be done in a place that serves beer... such as a bar.  However, it seems to be an unwritten rule at Distill that if you sit outside, you are immediately dubbed an a$$. AND... if you ask about beers, you can expect the waitress to only really know the size of the beer and have about a 60% accuracy rate on the hue of the beer. Getting any info on what a beer tastes like was pretty stupid on my part to think that a business would actually know the menu that is printed on paper and not handwritten on a chalkboard.   Having asked a few simple questions about a couple beers i had not heard of, it was clear that the waitress was really bothered by having to do the minimum amount of work; and, that we were outside was even more so of an insult to have to endure the constant walking to the nether regions of her place of employ to deal with people she clearly thought sucked.   I'm to blame for ordering the beers I ordered. However, the beers were crap. Whoever is in charge of ordering beers isn't good at their job.  The waitress was not a happy soul in any regard.  The outside seating was nice.   If either of the two previous failing businesses that were in this location returned, so would I. But as long as Distill somehow manages to profit in what is a pretty nice location, I guess i'll just be happy to have my beer outing adventures elsewhere.",

I have been here many times, but never had the Cure Burger.  Away we went, all 3 of us ordered the burger, and we were not disappointed! It was awesome! Big, messy and delicious!   Our server was awesome as well! She was funny, and a bit snarky in the most entertaining way! We loved her!   As I said, I have been before. Never left unhappy.

It came out beyond well done and all I could taste was the black char on the meat. She came over to see how everything was, took back the burger and I ordered avocado egg rolls in its place. I love avocado but this plate was disappointing as well! Absolutely no flavor! It comes with 4 pieces and and I still had 2 left on my plate when the server came over and cleared the table.

My now wife and I held out wedding rehearsal party for around 100 people in the outdoor patio and it absolutely exceeded our expectations. They were well staffed and very organized. Christine (one of the mangers) set up the entire event for us and everything went great. The set up was perfect, the food was fantastic, the staff was very attentive and helpful, and price was right in line with comparable venues around town.  They set up a full bar outside on the patio, had waited service as well, and set up a full buffet spread. It was also the little things that made a big difference like they had both regular and cucumber water available for guests to refresh at. They ensured that all guests were able to get transported home safely.  I absolutely recommend this option if you are ever hosting a party.  Every guest told me it was one of the best parties they had ever attended.",

A few people have said they doubt they would ever go back. It's very disappointing. I went there for lunch again today. We had to move two times to get away from the smoke. This could be a great place. In a day where smokers have options why does a non smoker have to be exposed and have a miserable experience? Management should reconsider their policy. Doubt we will go back unless it becomes smoke free.",

In fact, they have a sign in front of the restaurant stating that Distill was voted the \"best brunch in Summerlin.\"  Well, I do not know who voted, but it seriously is \"the worst\" (not just one of the worse) breakfasts I have ever had in the past 30+ years.   I had their Protein Omelet, and it had absolutely no flavor -- it was terrible. Another in our party ordered the Strawberry Waffle, and the strawberries (there are only 4 small strawberries on their so-called Strawberry Waffle) were FROZEN. Yes, FROZEN. When it was brought to the server's attention, she apologized and informed us, \"we don't have any fresh fruit.\"  She was right -- because the watermelon, cantaloupe, and other melons they serve as a side dish with their breakfasts also were frozen and tasteless. So, while the reviews for Distill are positive for the drinks and the typical \"bar food\" you get at a place like this (and I agree that this is a fun place in the evenings), they definitely need to drastically improve on their so-called \"best brunch in Summerlin\"!!!!!  Oh, BTW, the server (Maggie) was EXCELLENT.  Maybe the votes Distill received for being the \"best\" actually were intended to praise their servers (assuming that all are as excellent as Maggie).",

    "text": "Been here a couple of times since my last review (which wasn't very flattering) and had a blast. Kudos to Ronnie & Jade the bartenders for making one experience fantastic. Great bartenders who are laid back and a lot of fun that don't act like they are doing you a favor for being there.   Due to a step up in service, decided to do a little something different from our usual Sunday Football meetup and chose Distill. Our teams were in the Championship (Green Bay for some, Patriots for most of us) games so we got there early to take up tables and seats right in front of the screens. One thing really nice about this place is the multiple big screen TV's with plenty of tables / comfy seats set up in front of them which makes it a great place to watch the games.   Right after getting comfortable and drinks ordered, a super nice guy came up to us and introduced himself as Jeff the General Manager. Very genuine and hospitable... not often you have the GM take the time to go around and introduce himself in \"A Local Bar\". Took the time to raise the volume for the TV's in front of us to go along with the overhead volume so we could really hear the games and even came by to check on us to see how we were doing during the games.  Jeff mentioned he has been the GM there for about six months and I could certainly tell the place has improved.  Place ended up being jammed by game time with a great crowd. Ordered up tons of food for table sharing and the orders that really stood out were the Chipotle Chicken Nachos (delicious and huge) and found out why \"The Cure\" burger is rated one of the best in town.   Overall a great experience. The only things I could point out to have made it a Five Star experience is the Waitress never bothered to even introduce herself / give her name, wasn't very personable and didn't mention any of the drink specials taking place. Found out there was a special for pitchers of Bloody Mary's for $19.95 at the time we got there (after ordering single Bloody Mary's and paying full price to start off the day) and around the 4th quarter of the first game we found out that there was a Miller Lite special for the big 100 oz. self serve towers of beer. We only found out because we asked the table next to us that were ordering them. Kind of would have been nice for her to mention that when we were ordering up single beers and paying more than twice the price for pretty much the same thing. Four big bud lights for $24 a round or $12 for 100 oz of Miller Lite.... hmmm. Kind of a no brainer what to go with if we would have known to begin with.  Guess we should have asked when we first got there. Regardless, still a great time and we left stuffed, tipsy and happy.",

The appetizer (shrimp & artichoke dip) was so bland and lacked flavor that we traded out the dip for salsa.... No better. All you taste was pepper and again no other flavors. I then ordered the street tacos.... Soooo dry had issues actually swallowing the chicken. My BF got the Distilled chicken sandwich and that's when we found all the salt that was lacking in our other dishes. And to top it off our waitress had a bit of an angry personality. Sadly we will not b returning here. The atmosphere was ok.",

The food was delicious! It was nice that the manager checked on the party at least twice to make sure that everything was going well and see if there was anything we needed. I would definitely recommend Distill for your next event! The patio is nicely decorated and there is plenty of seating. The fireplaces add to the ambience.",

So my husband and I just went here today initially for a few drinks after work, but we enjoyed the vibe and the look of the place so we decided to stay for dinner.  We are very glad we did.  We had these tasty crab bites to start.  My husband had a patty melt that he liked so much that I barely got a bite.  The thing that sealed the deal for me were the banana fritters for dessert - fried just right with a rockin' carmel sauce.  As locals, we finally feel like we may have found a place that has the right balance between being a funky bar and a very good restaurant.  We are going to go back to see if we are right.",

I had bacon and eggs, which were ok. I think they used powdered eggs which is why I say the breakfast was just ok. On the plus side, the service was great! Plus the bar has lots of tv and seating. Look forward to watching football games there in the fall, or trying out the pool tables. I'm definitely going back to try out lunch and/or dinner and their happy hour!",

Upon getting our food, we were never approached by the bartender again.   Our friend joined us later on and sat down. Another bartender came up and asked our friend for ID and then looked at us and asked us again. (we had been eating and drinking for an hour already at this bar).   Our friend was able to get one drink from that bartender, then never saw him again. After 25 mins of us waiting to order another drink, and our friend waiting 15 mins to find the bartender to order food, we had enough and had to yell across the bar to get our check. The bartender apologized for the wait and never offered us anything else after.   The food was alright, but the service sucked. We work hard for our money, and expect great service when we spend it. This place will not be on our list again.",

Unfortunately, despite it not being very busy, the service didn't match my limited amount of time. I even told the server, when she finally came around, that I had a pretty short lunch hour.   She was quite leisurely, to say the least.   The menu is pretty extensive, with everything from breakfast to burgers to pizza. Most items were between $10-$15.  I ordered the Blanco pizza, and it was fine, if a little bland. The crust was good, though. Not too crisp, not too doughy.   The patio area looked really nice, and I wish we'd gone out there, but I completely forgot about it until it was time to leave.   I'd probably try it again when I can sit and enjoy myself, but if you're in a hurry, I'd suggest going elsewhere.",

Out of the 4, Greek fries was probably the best. Chicken lettuce wraps was too salty for me and the short ribs tacos was okay - nothing special.   Service was great and our server was attentive. I give it 4 stars since the food wasn't all that.",

    "text": "Distill is a warm and inviting place. Its located close to BJ's in Summerlin, with tons of parking.  They have a large outdoor patio with plenty of seating for you and your friends. Very large location, Irish beers, and easy to read menus!  *  Welcome Experience -  Ordinary - Upon entering the main door I was expecting to find a server or greeter standing there, however there wasn't anyone.  Within a minute or two a lady approached me with a warm smile and told me I could sit wherever I wanted and a server would bring us some menus.  I wish I would of been greeted sooner, but in the end it worked out.   *  Establishment -  Outstanding - The design of the overall business is fantastic. Its clean, open, casual, with great music playing in the back ground. There is a pool table off in the corner, a large bar in the center, and a really awesome Patio area.  *  Service -  Outstanding - Our waitress, and her assistants were awesome! They checked on us routinely, and made sure we had everything that we needed. Wish I remembered the ladies name. I found out that she had worked a double shift and was still cheery and all smiles!  *  Food Quantity / Quality / Presentation -  Outstanding - The Food was amazing. You never know how a place is going to be when they first open.  Wish I would of taken some pictures of the food. The Mashed Potatoes Bites were DELICIOUS!! The Appetizers were well proportioned, and the quality was amazing.  Kudos to the kitchen staff on a job well done!,  * Stuff that isn't important but I felt it was worth mentioning.  They have power outlets everywhere! We were there for a business meeting and I was surprised to find power outlets in the main dinning room near a lot of the tables.  Great place to have a casual business meeting.   Looks like they could accommodate large group meetings as well.   The menus were very easy to read, and well put together.   *  What I'll remember - The Moscow Mule Drink! AMAZING. and the food. soo good. I will also remember the reasonable prices.  The quick prompt services.   *  What I can't wait to forget   Nothing! It was all quite amazing. And I am a huge critic. This place rocks, way better than some chain restaurant.  They have nice views, and would be a great place to go on a date, or to have beers, lunch, and dinner with your friends.   Suggestions:  - I would suggest they take dinner reservations during prime dinner hours",

All the bartenders are nice and personable and pour amazing drinks! The food isn't too shabby either. A lot of their menu items are very good and you can run into some menu items you normally don't see at a local bar. I enjoy their Cajun chicken wrap or the southwestern chicken salad. On their happy hour menu, the filet mignon sliders are great as well.   It does get really busy and crowded on the weekends and if you're not sitting at the bar, sometimes the service lacks which is why I rate this place a 4 instead of 5.  There has been times where we've taken a seat and no one has came by and we would have to get the attention of some of the servers just to get started. My advice, sit at the bar. You'll get great service there regardless when you go.",

First time, sat at the bar, ordered the mule drink and a chicken dinner. Cute bartender took our order for drinks, then disappeared...finally another one took our meal order. Chicken had good flavor, lots of food on the plate, but was a touch dry. My friend has the tacos, he enjoyed them and got full on 3.  2nd time came in a bit drunk with a couple friends. Not too many people there except the bar/wait staff off work. Had the chicken fried steak breakfast and it was pretty good. My friends didn't win any money so they went home early and unhappy.  3rd time came in with a group of 3 other friends, we had some cocktails and some chips/salsa while watching the college hoop games. TV's are a little weird if you sit at the hightop table. Our waitress was fantastic, gave us a free beer (mistake) and a free philly cheesesteak sandwich (another mistake). We all had a good time.  Drink orders were a bit slow to start with, and a glass of water had to come from someone different which is strange. The place was relatively busy and I didn't notice it being smoky. I guess the only reason I'm downgrading to 3.5 stars was the slow service on visit 1 and 3, and the chicken not being that great. I guess I'm used to really good food. This was typical normal bar food and nothing special.",

First time I came I tried the mule on the specialty cocktail menu, it was terrible. Tried a regular mule and was still a disappointment. Decided to come back and give them another shot, A friend and I tried every drink on the specialty cocktail list and a margarita. None good at all. What's a bar without good drinks? If you're a beer drinker or just want to come and play pool, definitely worth checking out.",

I got really excited last time I was here because I found out they had Chainbreaker IPA on draft (woop woop) and it was delish! But the food here is wack. It's just something to fill your stomach with. Sliders are sub par. And the pizza is TERRIBLE! Seriously, some store bought shz that took forever to come out. Idk what this place is trying to do. After living in the area for a while, I know that all the businesses that try to take over this building don't do well. And idk why. But this place needs some work too. If the prices were cheaper, then I guess I could reason out the quality, but as of now...it's overpriced for stuff I could microwave at the grocery store :-(   As for ambience--- I mostly just like that there are a lot of seats. The bartenders are kind of weird/borderline rude. Not really friendly? But seem to have side comments galore. There's also a random \"I Love the 80s\" poster in the middle of the room, smh.",

We came on a Sat. night around 7:30/8 towards the end of a Golden Knights game that was on nearly every TV in the place & although it was very crowded (I think there was a Christmas party or 2 going on at the same time) we were able to get a low table with some comfy chairs.  The service was fantastic! I didn't get the servers name (on the receipt it said her name was: Banquet Server2) She was great, knowledgeable about the menu and attentive even though there was tons going on.  This place is open 24/7 and they proudly serve bar food, but this food was above and beyond the normal bar food I'm used to or was expecting.  My compliments to the chef and the kitchen, because everything came out tasting fresh, flavorful and detailed!  You can't mess around in Vegas, there are too many options. I was expecting a run of the mill PT's menu, but this place was outstanding and I can't wait to go back!  We ordered Cracked Bread with artichoke dip, buffalo cauliflower, stuffed mushrooms and the Greek Sandwich.(we split everything) and we brought way too many leftovers home! Let me just say this sandwich was one of the best I've ever had. The chicken breast was moist and tender. Who/ whomever is running this place is on their game!",

Granted, it was fairly busy with football watchers. One of the electric pool tables had no power, and the other had an overhead light out. One was in a spot too tight for shooting as well. The pool cues were terrible. I ordered the Filet Sliders, and they were absolutely gross. Under-cooked, disgusting. I demanded a refund after just one bite. If you sit at the bar on a Sunday afternoon drinking beer, you might like this place. If you don't, there are dozens of places better.",

This might have been tolerable if the pizza hadn't been cooked on what seemed to be a rehydrated piece of hard tack. It was almost like they took a generic digiorno pizza crust, put some stuff on and microwaved it for way too long. I know, it might not have been there signature dish and all, but why have it on the menu if it's some half assed supreme boboli faux pizza bs? If that is how they treat something as simple of a staple as a pizza, I can't imagine what they do to the other items on their menu.  On top of that, our servers kept rotating so it was hard to keep track of who to ask for what. Most of them were fine but the last guy (dark spikey haired bar tender guy) was a complete jerk. Totally inconsiderate, ill tempered, abrasive, rude and disrespectful. He made me and my girlfriend very uncomfortable to say the least. Like he was trying to ruin our night but I'm glad I could keep my cool. So if you're ever looking for a place with jerk bartenders that unjustly belittled their customers, distill - a local bar - douchebag central -might be just the place you've been looking for. But seriously, do yourself a favor and please, just go anywhere else.",

I think he officially insulted every single group out there.  He repeatedly called the players '*itches'; screamed out that one player must want to 'blow' another player because he put his arm around him; yelled out the 'F' word over and over; made fun of an injured black player being taken off the filed and told him to 'go see his 7 kids' ....but it gets better...he screamed out that if his team didn't make a certain play that he was going to 'kill every single person in the bar' - oh really?  And where was the manager you ask? Standing behind the guy just staring with wide eyes...CLEARLY not knowing what to do.  Ridiculous!  I don't care how passionate you are about your team or a game...but you don't need to scream obscenities or threaten to kill people.  C'mon Distill Management...you should have booted this guy after his first episode!  So disappointed and disgusted!",

It was quality and delicious food. I ordered again another day, same great quality and tasty food. We then decided to come in and dine in... you're immediately reminded that it's a bar with poker machines etc, but aside from that the food is pretty freaking good.

She did not break! What a trooper! Her attitude remained positive from beginning to end! She had to deal with ALOT and she never broke her uplifting positive facade! I'm just obsessed with her and her immaculate service!!  We come back months later, and she still remembered us and welcomed us into her section with open arms and a wide happy smile! She's my favorite type of server! Just overall wonderful! And her attention to detail is top quality!! Her attitude towards her job and towards everyone else both happy and difficult, stays the same! She gives her best service to everyone! That's a tough quality to find in a person! She just doesn't break! She's smiling, happy, positive, and genuine from the moment you walk in to the moment you walk out! Always polite, responsive, quick, and on top of everything! She stays ahead at all times!

    "text": "I love distill. The food is usually top notch. This time I got The Cure burger. The patty itself had no flavor or seasoning. The jalepeno  jelly that comes on it is sweet but no kick of jalepeno at all. I didn't taste the spicy mayo or the soy in the onions, and I feel like it was missing the fried parsnips. Soggy bun on top of all of that. Bottom bun was soggy. Not the worst burger I've ever had BUT the description made it sound super rich and flavorful & it  was plain and had no texture. The fries are some of the worst ever. Not crisp, lackluster flavor, not even a hint of salt. Doused them in honey mustard & buffalo sauce (both of which weren't great). Side salad with ranch was super good. I can't get myself to give this place low stars because I love it and the food usually is good. Maybe cook was busy or it just wasn't his or her day. I'll give the food a couple more tries and just order something else next time",

Walked in, no one greeted us so I had to hunt down a server and ask if it was \"seat yourself\" ... It was. After we sat ourself we waited for almost 10 mins before our server showed up with water. We knew what we wanted so we placed our order. The service was slow. The food was sub par. The margarita tasted like straight mix. The water was tap so we had to ask for bottle. Nothing about this place would have us coming back.... We were better off going to BJs where the food and the service are great!!",

    "text": "The gentleman sitting next to me at the bar and I were in agreement; a name like Distill might not appeal to both sexes equally. The place did appear a little lopsided, with few members of the smarter sex represented in the crowd, but maybe it was just an off night.  You have to be envious of the location (though I cannot for the life of me imagine why the prior establishment closed down, they made the best $5 burritos every Sunday morning in the parking lot), many a west-sider will find themselves in this area when on the hunt for food.  At first I wanted to bemoan the continued downward spiral of the local Las Vegas food scene, specifically the burger I ordered that they affectionately refer to as \"The Cure\", but then I realized -  YES - I definitely want to bemoan the continued downward spiral of the local Las Vegas food scene.  The Cure was, well, unremarkable in every way, despite a description that promised so much:   \"Hand crafted burger: ground beef and pork blend stuffed with fontina cheese topped with soy marinated onions, jalapeno jelly, lettuce, tomato, spicy mayo and fried parsnips on a brioche bun.\"   Doesn't it just sound tasty? Well it's not. Unremarkable, is the best way to describe it. There was one more thing, the second half of my burger was ice cold by the time I finished the first - not that the first half was piping hot or anything, but ice cold?  The bar menu has no section for \"distilled spirits\", despite the name, another thing the gentleman sitting next to me thought was curious. They did have a coffee infused whiskey as part of their signature Manhattan, but if you didn't read the description of the drink you would have never known they offer this unusual item. I asked the bartender about the coffee infused whiskey - and before I could even finish my sentence, he returns with TWO shots of the curious liquid - one for me and one for this gentleman I just met - and then charged BOTH of them to my tab. Wow, really?  If I were the one opening a restaurant in this enviable western valley location, I personally would have avoided the poker machines. But then my goal would have been to wow patrons with good food and service, rather than just open another smoky gambling hall.  In all, the food is not great, the service needs a little, well, delicacy and the place sure was overflowing with men - but I thought is was okay.",

With a brewery style decor that has lounges, table seating, pool tables and a very nice large bar to boot, Distill is great setting for groups or a sit down meal.  Checking in on yelp you'll grab a Distill bar infused Bourbon on the house. The bartender gave me a pretty sweet Coffee infused bourbon with diet coke. I'm gonna say this was pretty nice drop and if you like a little sweet I recommend it.  For dinner we ordered some mash potato bites as an app!!! Order them! They are amazing. For dinner we got the six pack sliders!!! A mix or combo of different sliders. Ruben, cheeseburger and Philly cheese steak. All were pretty tasty.  Id like to give this place 5 stars but maybe because it was full and hard to find a seat I didn't get the full experience. For sure a place to come back to and will be a nice watering hole for a lot of people",

    "text": "Having lived on the Summerlin side of town for a long time to see this actual building rotate though a former life of being many different restaurants/bars over many years, I think there might be a recipe with this new Distill that might make it stick.    Unlike prior restaurants/bars in the same space who really never changed it up so much, the decor and design has changed just so to make it feel and look brand new and that time and consideration was put into this remodel.  It is still built on a round center bar, but they have knocked down enough walls, put up enough brick and done enough design changes to make it feel welcoming and different.    Pretty expansive menu considering it is basically a bar (which includes breakfast 24/7, which I personally found to be a big bonus), what I thought to be reasonably priced and many nooks/spots to sit and hunker down to meet with friends, it seems like a good \"local spot.\"  Often in Vegas, we (or maybe me) look to restaurants/bars that are unique/have an edge/have a niche, when indeed to great solid, basic staple with nice staff, good food and a nice atmosphere.  Although there is nothing earth shattering or noteworthy to say \"this place is awesome\" (although there are pool tables in the back),  I still enjoyed going and will absolutely go back.  As it advertises wanting to be a local hangout, I think they might be on to something and being a local in the Summerlin area, I will go back.    Curious about the smoking policy, for the nice hostess indicated that you could smoke anywhere and I saw only one person smoking who was sitting at the bar.   With people eating everywhere and NV law, not sure the hostess was correct.  I am not a smoker and a \"you can smoke anywhere\" bar would surely be the only thing that would turn me off about this place.  Again, I did not grill the nice hostess any further, although would clarify when I am in there again.    Maybe it is indeed my new local hangout.",

If you're looking for an upscale, napkin folded in an animal shape kind of place, well then this place is NOT for you.   When we walked in, we weren't greeted nor were we seated. It was odd yes. But after we found a table, the bartender came to us and made us feel at home. We cracked a few jokes, she took our drink orders and made us feel like family. When our waitress finally came, she too, also made us feel at home.   The food was good. We had breakfast and it felt like large portions. Maybe it was the fact that the plates were the size of platters. Nonetheless we all couldn't finish our meals. We all ordered different dishes and I have to say, their breakfast menu is pretty good.   A future plan to visit this place is in the works. It's a great place for food, fun and a great atmosphere.",

Made sense to me, especially when the Golden Knights are located just down the street from here.  I guess I will need to find another place to watch the game from here on out",

I like the bathrooms, though it can get tight opening and closing the stall doors.  New gambling card sign ups get a $10 free play after some play.  I like their liquor selection, specifically the tequila brands I don't see very often.  Mr Bartender took great care of us on this late night visit. Lots of regulars.",

My friend decided one night after shopping Downtown Summerlin we weren't really ready to call it a night so he suggested this place. Of course I had to check YELP first to see how the reviews and overall ratings were before agreeing (YES I am that person) anyways, I'm glad that I did because it was a great time.   Our server was Brittany (I believe) and she was AMAZING. It wasn't long after we seated ourselves outside on the patio that this big ray of sunshine came on over and started with our drink orders. I love to try",

The bar is super large and the decor is quintessential, especially some of the waggish signs they have on the walls.  The bar was very very busy, but the service was still pretty good for being that busy. I ordered some appetizers and the food was, in my opinion, very satisfying.   I found that this location is seemingly better than some of the others like Flamingo/Durango. The ambient low lighting and other unique factors of the building made this a great choice to hang out at.  There is even a cool little patio area...if you can get past the nunerous cicadas that are out there!!",

It's a fairly large it's a sports bar and it has very nice outdoor seating which if you don't want to listen to the music or watch the sports at the great location to sit and chat and eat and drink with your friends. The staff really takes care of you and I make sure that if you don't get your food you are taken care of and they make sure that you are a happy customer. The food is delicious at least what I've had there I've enjoyed. The drinks are also very good.  The restrooms are really dark but they try to keep them clean. In general I'm pretty happy with this location and terms of going out for happy hour, whether you drink or you don't this is definitely a place you want to visit.",

They offer a selection of specialty martinis, and the few I've tried have been good. One of their burgers, the hangover cure or something, won a best burger award from Thrillist. I had it and it was very good. I recently had the Italian sandwich, which was pretty tasty as well.  For a poker bar, it's not bad. Nice decor, decent drinks and food.  Their anniversary parties are memorable, and the 5th was a Luau party.  It was a great event, with a free buffet, raffles and drink specials. On the buffet was teriyaki beef, chicken & macadamia crusted mahi as well as macaroni salad, green salad & macadamia cookies. The free photos offered at the party was a nice touch also. They were photo booth style on a green screen with multiple backgrounds available, and who doesn't love free pics!   Distill also has a yearly 80s party, which was really nice the first year. They handed out sunglasses, buttons, etc. to accessorize with. The 3rd 80s party didn't compare to previous ones. They do have themed drink specials during the parties, such as Long Islands, lemon drop martinis and various beer specials.",

    "text": "Cold beer, nice space and plenty of TVs!  OK friends, if you agree that you can tell a good bar by the way they pour your beer, specifically Guinness beer, then hang in here with me for a couple of minutes!   If you are a beer lover, when you step into a bar for the first time, ask them for a glass of Guinness and then watch carefully! Here are the five factors that you must monitor:  1) Right glass! You can't pour beer into just any glass, it has to be the right kind of glass! If the glass is not right, cancel your order and run out!!  2) The angle! Pouring Guinness, the glass must be held in a 45 degree angle. If the angle is not 45, you high tail it out of there!!  3) Fill it to Harp!! If they are using Guinness glasses, they must fill it to just under the Harp icon on the glass. If it is another glass, they must leave about an inch or so empty. If the bartender fills it up to the rim, leave!!  4) Let it settle! They must let the beer settle for just about 2 minutes. If they are rushing it, they don't know what they are doing! Get out of there!!  5) The Top Up!! After waiting for two minutes, they should hold the glass straight under the tap and top it up so that you get that nice foam on the top. Not enough foam? Don't touch the beer, cancel your order and vanish!  Got it? Good!  Now based on my completely unscientific research, most bars that pour Guinness correctly, can do most cocktails right too!    That brings us back to Distill. I was watching my bartender like a hawk! At first she did not impress me as someone who would get this right, but to my pleasant surprise she did pick up the right kind of beer glass, even better she did keep my glass at almost 45 degree angle and before filling it up, she put it down and walked away to attend to other customers! As soon as I saw that I thought \"Yessss!\" Sure enough she came back about a couple minutes later and topped it up and put it on the bar right in front of me. Perfect glass full of \"correctly\" poured delicious Guinness!!  Distill is very spacey and comfortable, they have a nice bar, good bartenders and service, good bar food and plenty of TVs on the walls if you are into sports. Now I often visit Summerlin (Northwest Las Vegas) because I have family there; this visit convinced me that I should stop at Distill for a beer or two every time I go to there.",

I got the Atlantic salmon. The rice pilaf was delicious, the asparagus, average and the salmon was so terribly over salted. If I weren't so hungry, I wouldn't have finished it.  Good enough for a second try.. next time we'll try their burgers and sliders instead of their entrees.",

The ingredients were all very fresh and it was a large portion. I really enjoyed their fries too especially with a side of ranch. They have the good, watery type of ranch. My friend's food looked great too.  I would definitely come back here again. The food and service were great & you can't beat $15 beer towers.",

    "text": "Last night a group of us met up to hang out and say farewell to a friend and coworker.  When you first arrive the place gives off a charming vibe with hanging lights over the patio and cozy seating areas.  It easily accommodated our large group of 9 but does enforce a strictly 21 and up policy.   Our waitress was friendly and was able to provide several recommendations on food and drinks to try. I had the \"Slippery When Wet\" which was delightfully sweet with its delicious blueberry liquor and beautiful green presentation.  For food I tried the clam chowder (special of the day) which was a little chewy for my taste but still decent.  As well as the classic staple of chicken fingers and fries.  I got to try the mashed potato balls which were downright melt-in-your-mouth tasty with the pink sauce.   They were rather busy so the drinks took a while to come out but the staff was attentive and checked in on us several times throughout the evening.  All in all a great hangout spot to have a relaxing evening on the patio or just head inside towards the bar for a more lively (albeit loud) experience.",

    "text": "Generally good food with unpredictable service catering to gamblers first. I've been coming here since it was the Agave Mexican restaurant (succeeded by Dos Caminos and then Distill).  The building's roots as a restaurant explain the unusually large size for a gaming bar and Distill's persistent trouble providing table service. Gaming bars were never meant to be this big.   What's really interesting is that the quality of service seems to have no correlation to number of staff or patrons. I've literally been the only person there with a bartender and a server on duty, and I couldn't get a drink to save my life. Nota bene, it's been quite a while since I've had this problem. The current staff are much better but YMMV.  Tipping has minimal impact on service. Your can have a few drinks, leave a 30% tip, and the bar staff just wants to hustle you out so they can focus on the gamers. The tip out on gaming can be 10% or more. That's where the money is (for the house and the bar staff).  That doesn't mean non-gamers shouldn't patronize Distill. It means you should understand the establishment has a gaming focus and don't expect the same kind of service you would get at a traditional restaurant.  I gave Distill three stars because the beer and liquor selection is pretty diverse with boutique/craft offerings and because the food is very good for the money (salads, burgers, and breakfast items stand out in particular).",

Croque Madame - Swiss, Ham, Bechamel, Eggs, Hash Browns Chicken and Waffles - Fried Chicken drizzled with caramel chipotle sauce, waffles French Toast - Bread Pudding with Banana Foster Sauce  Located just a mile from my front door, and recently offering brunch as only a 24/7 'Local Bar' in Las Vegas can, it was just after 8am that I entered Distill and with the crew mopping floors as a few locals sat playing video slots beneath the echoes of KISS's \"Shout it Out Loud\" it was to a Please Seat Yourself sign that I was greeted - a seat in the upper rim selected with a young woman named Chrissy interrupting her duties of setting up the Bloody Mary Bar to procure me a menu, water, and the first of several cups of surprisingly good coffee.  Offering a 24/7 menu of items ranging from snacks, sandwiches, and salads to entrees and even hearty breakfasts it was largely for the weekend-only 8a-2p brunch that I'd scheduled my first visit to Distill and ordering in two rounds with every item recommended as a good choice by both my server and Assistant GM Kristyne, who stopped by to chat no less than three times, the meal unfolded in four plates that all showed surprising creativity and execution one would generally see reserved for far more 'fancy' spots.  Beginning savory, it was with a paper-lined cone full of tender cheesy potatoes beneath a golden topcoat that the meal began, and paired with a duo of sauces from which the smoky sour cream was undoubtedly a standout the flavors were up front without a bit of the greasiness oft associated with fried potatoes - the hashbrowns served next to a competent croque madame for example, though the sandwich itself was little more than ham, egg, and cheese on toast as the Bechamel was a touch too thick and unfortunately under-flavored.  Moving on to two more brunch-specific selections, as the soundtrack shifted briefly to Pink and copious coffee refills continued, round two saw the arrival of two substantially larger entrees and although the chicken tenders proved no better than the sort one would expect at a decent pub the waffle was executed beautifully with a crunchy exterior and springy crumb, the spicy sauce keeping sweet caramel in check - a sense of balance equally achieved by three thick slices of custard-soaked breaded seared crisp with sticky bananas foster finding its foil in a toasty layer of nuts.  --------------------------------------------------------------------  Far exceeding modest expectations in terms of food, scene, and customer service with prices trending far lower than several other spots in the city it is only a matter of time before I return to Distill and although I'm certainly not the bar's target audience for booze and games I also look forward to seeing whether the quality carries over to Elixir and Remedy's, the Henderson based members of their growing 24/7 family.",

I went to the bar and ordered a rum and coke and a sea breeze (vodka cranberry) for my wife. $6.00 cool with a $2.00 tip. We find a seat and a short haired blond waitress asks if we want anything after about 30 mins of sitting there. Sure another round and a side of fries (frozen) about $3.00. we were sitting and the band came on, so we walked up to see the band I found the waitress and I told her I would take care of her when the band was over. She kept on watching us like a hawk as if we were going to skip out? when the band was over I went to the waitress and said I want to close out. She gives me my bill which should have been about $9.00 and it said $16.93? I looked at it and said whats this? It said I ordered a sex on the beach and something else. She oh that's how it rings up, I said a sex on the beach and a sea breeze are 2 different things. I gave her money for the bill as she was getting my change I walked to the bar where she was at and I said can I see that bill again and tried to explain to her that she gave me the wrong bill. She said yelling at me I'll take care of it, it's not worth it to deal with this and gave me my change and threw the receipt at me. I still walked out of there paying someone else s bill.  I will not be going back with that kind of service.",

However the server who was supposed to be serving us in our section completely ignored us, didn't give us menus and when we asked if our table had a server she said yes and she would be right over, never came, which in turn, made us go straight for the bar. For someone who works in the service industry, I'm pretty understanding and patient, however she didn't have many tables, and it wasn't that busy, and to just ignore a party of 3, is a clear sign of bad service. If I return, I'll make sure to only order from the bar, where we get immediate service.",

Atmosphere is great, plenty of TV's available from all seats with the ability to watch multiple games at the same time.  We decided to hang out in the pool table/video game area. Even though we weren't at a table or bar we were given prompt service from the bartender and got our food and drinks ordered. They have a standard bar menu with plenty of items to choose from burgers to seared salmon. As we were here right in the middle of the afternoon I just went with their bratwurst sandwich. It came out pretty quick and was actually not bad at all. It cooked perfectly, bun was lightly toasted and came with a generous helping of fries. They have a full bar available with a wide selections of beers on tap. There is a Yelp special of getting their house whiskey for free if you check in but drink at your own risk! All and all, a great place to kick back on a Sunday.",

The atmosphere is very enjoyable and usually always fun, depending on what crowd has managed their way in side! During our first visit here, it was extremely hard to get a bartenders attention, and when we mentioned it to the bar back Rob, not only was he on top of the customer service..he got us our drinks and convinced us to come back. As we continued to come back the service has definitely changed for the better.. But I must say, there are still  sometimes it's hard to get a drink. That could easily be fixed with just a little more organization behind the bar.   The food is absolutely delicious! I'm a pretty picky person for the most part but I'm definitely trying everything on the menu! Mozzarella sticks, salads, wings, wraps, pretzel bites, sliders... It's all delicious!  Phil, Dan, Rob and Rick are pretty awesome bartenders! I enjoy coming in when they're working. Rob is usually on top of his game and is always checking up on you to make sure you're okay and if you need anything!   There's two of guys that I have not named; that I could careless about due to their attitude. So I try to stay out of the bar when they are there.   I've had some crappy service at bars before and ended up not even enjoying my drinks.. At least at this place I know I'm going to have a great time!   Anyways great local hangout! Pretty chill, fun environment. See you all there!  Rick is by far my favorite bartender here!",

There was more lettuce than anything...it was seriously a lettuce wrap. Now if you're going there for drinks, their prices are pretty reasonable.

When I was in high school this place was Agave (a Mexican restaurant), and now it's completely revamped into a great local spot! The outdoor patio is super cute with string lights and comfy seating areas, and the inside is decorated very nicely as well. The restrooms even say \"For those who sit\" and \"For those who stand,\" haha. Especially compared to the other 24 hour local bars around the city, I would have to say this is my favorite.   The only reason I took off a star is because I ordered the sweet potato french fries (which were INCREDIBLE - they even came with their own maple/brown sugar dipping sauce) and I guess there was a miscommunication between the bartender and the kitchen, because I had to ask about 20 minutes later where my fries were. My friend said she's never had that happen to her before, so I assume it must've been a fluke. The bartender was very apologetic and immediately went to the kitchen to see what had happened. Other than that, this place was great! I'll absolutely be returning.",

Listen the place is open 24 hours and its close to a lot of things on the west side...     after a certain time of night...   your options are limited...      Im just glad to have a place like this to go to any time of day or night...      the good FAR out ways the bad with this place.      You can check in on yelp and grab a free inused whiskey...    I'm a whiskey fan, but I wasnt a fan of it...    but I do  appreciate it.",

My friend and I decided to meet here Thursday to watch the return of VGK hockey. We showed up an hour early to get good seats. We noticed a ton of other VGK supporters so we were excited. We asked the waitress (after ordering food) if they were going to switch the sound and TVs over to the hockey game instead of football. Waitress wasn't sure. Ok. Food came. We both got the same thing, chicken fingers. Once again we asked about the game. It was now close to 7pm. Again we were told it was the managers discretion. I was getting pretty frustrated. Finally some TVs switched over but the sound is AWFUL omg does it only work for half the bar? They were having issues all night, even the waitress said they were just putting out fires everywhere. It made the experience unenjoyable overall. Definitely not a good environment to watch big games at. Also my friend ended up getting food poisoning, even though we ate the exact same thing. I say if you want to watch sports, go somewhere else.",

It amazes me that this bar and this particular burger are not more popular, as it is a fantastic amalgamation of all the best flavors a burger should have: savory, cheesy, just a bit of spice. It's stuffed and juicy without falling apart, and every ingredient successfully harmonizes with the others. It's a hefty patty, and when assembled with all the fixings it's so tall it's difficult to bite into, and you will make a mess. But it will be worth it, because this is a damn good burger. And a unique one, at that!  I am going to make a bold statement and declare this THE best burger in Las Vegas... for now. It's a competitive city for this title, but the Cure comes out on top.  Excuse the god-awful blurry photos, my haste to devour this amazing meal apparently affected my picture-taking abilities. You'll have to see (and taste!) it for yourself.

I will definitely think twice before doing that again. This was the worst service I've had in a long time, and the food wasn't great either. We were up in the pool area and were ignored by the waiter for 30 minutes while he helped all the people around us. Once helped, drinks took way too long to arrive. A little later, he was off duty and someone else came to help us. I was relieved, but my relief was short lived. After we asked for a menu, it took a while to arrive, and then she didn't even come back to take our order for another twenty minutes. Wouldn't you assume that someone who asked for a menu was hungry and would like to place an order sooner rather than later? I had to make uncomfortable prolonged eye contact with her from across the bar to even get her to come over. The food took a some time to arrive, and my sandwich was not good. I asked for it without sauce and got it with sauce, along with a piece of chicken that was 100% gristle. I dared not ask for another one. I will not be returning any time soon, if ever again. I left quite a few things out, but I think you can understand that I did not have a good experience. I expected more, for sure.",

Go ahead order a bloody mary... You won't be disappointed. There's an extensive selection of fun stuff that you can doctor it up anyway you choose. The plate of bacon was a huge hit with my friends.   The food is really good too. I ordered the steak & eggs and it came out perfect. Nice quality new York strip and good portion of eggs. I'm pretty picky about my potatoes but the hash browns passed the test. Other crowd favorites were the Bubble and Squeak and Chicken and Waffles - both recommended by the manager, Kristyne. I also really liked the chicken street tacos.   As far as staff, everyone was very nice. Channel & Rick behind the bar took great care of us. Kristyne was very hilarious and kept a good eye on us. Everyone seemed to really care about making sure we had a good experience. I'm sure I'll be back for more of that bloody mary bar!  Oh my gosh, I almost forgot to mention how much I liked the bathrooms. Haha I love the angled flat sinks and individual wood stalls, very nice touch!",

    "text": "I went here specifically to try the \"Cure\" burger. I saw some legit reviews, and also was on the hunt for the best burger in Las Vegas.   Cure burger - 2 star.   I was unfortunately disappointed. The burger tasted as though it was missing something. I found the meat patty itself to lack flavor, the other additions in the burger fell a bit short. There was some sweetness to it, but it was needing either a tad bit more, or some contrasting flavor to bring it out, which I didn't experience.   The only assumption I can make is that, it was a busy night with a major game, and happy hour time. I don't know if it was cooked differently than if I had come at a less busy time. I hate writing this review, since I was looking forward to this burger.   Chipotle Chicken Nachos- 3 star. Average nachos. The chips though, were delicious, and I'd probably come back and get the chips and dip or the chips and salsa as the salsa was VERY fresh and delicious.  I do want to note that I LOVE the interior design of this place. The outside patio is gorgeous, and if the weather isn't too hot or too cold, it'd be such a great place to sit and dine with friends. Inside, there was an area where there was a huge couch, and a tv right in front, almost as though you are watching a game from home. So brilliant!  Service was a 5 star.   For some drinks and game days, this place is ideal.",

First impression after walking into the building was \"this is a dark, dingy and stinky dive bar.\"  There were 3 of us dining together and we each ordered a bar drink... only 2 showed up. And one of the drinks we ordered was a Old Fashioned. That's a classic drink any bartender should be able to make... but that's not the case here. We did have the drink remade, it tasted better but still not made correctly. We asked our server where the 3rd drink was at that we ordered, he asked \"what was it?\" (Thinking t myself, you wrote all 3 down you should know.) we told him what it was but then just declined the drink after the disappointment of the Old Fashioned.  Then to our appetizers: We ordered the Avocado Egg-rolls and Buffalo Chicken Dip. They egg rolls  were really good... but the chips that came with the dip not so much. After yet another disappointment, we decided to not order a dinner entree and left.",

Being in the service industry myself, was very nice having such a nice friendly person taking care of us.   Most of the food was very good, except for the sliders which were rather tough.

I ALWAYS order my steaks/burgers medium rare, but this was a time where I couldn't because it wasn't an all beef patty, the cure burger is a mix of beef and pork, so we ordered it medium. We also ordered Their steak sandwich(forgot the name) and split both. I think it was kinda like a French Dip.  Our Server was great, offering suggestions and answering questions we had about anything on the menu. Our orders came out rather quickly and dug right in. The steak sandwich was very tasty, meat was well seasoned and the roll was nicely toasted. The Cure Burger was love at first bite, and is as good as everyone raves about! A bit messy in a good way, and the Jalapeno Jam gives it a nice kick. We enjoyed every bite.  I don't know about you, but after having something savory, I crave something sweet, so we took a look at the dessert menu. Their Bread Pudding sounded good, so we went with that. When our server brought it to our table, our initial reaction was WTF!?!? This BEAST could seriously feed 4-6 people and pretty much covered the entire plate almost! The gooey nut topping part was good, but the custard part needed a little more love. After a couple of stabs, we were done.  Great visit, and a good spot for late night drinks and bites, but the kids aren't allowed...ALOHA!!!  Shaka Meter:  \\uuu/  \\uuu/  \\uuu/  \\uuu/  4",

He kept asking me the same questions over and over. As soon as my meal came, I quickly ate and left, most likely not to return. The bartender must have been ok with the customer being drunk, as she constantly interacted with him in a very friendly way. The 2 stars are for the food only.",

We had the chips and salsa and mashed potato bites - both were delicious.  Happy Hour counts on Saturday so I had the red sangria- and as recommended it was tasty! For dinner we had the grilled shrimp tacos and the Distill chicken sandwich. Both were very well done and delicious. They are working on new menu updates so I'll be back to see what else they come up with.   The staff was super attentive and friendly. Kudos to Connie and Tony for taking such great care of us.

The yummy fried artichokes were battered served with a mayo based dip.    The bruschettas were toasted and garlicky served with chopped tomato and onion.  The salsa was smokey and delicious.  The chips were heated but a little on the hard side.  I like my chips to be light and flaky, but at 2 bucks, I can't complain!  My server Laney (sp?) suggested a Jameson and Ginger Beer with 3 lemons.  OMG it was delicious!  We will be back!  Update:  We came back for breakfast and were  lucky to get Laney again.  We both got bacon and eggs and shared a short stack.  The coffee was roasty, delicious and refilled frequently. My over easy eggs were perfect.  A side of applewood bacon, crispy hash browns and sourdough toast completed this huge breakfast.  We couldn't touch our supersized pancakes.  We probably will be back for dinner!!!",

The menu is really diverse so everyone can find something super tasty to fit their dietary needs. They have great burgers, tacos , ahi, vegan items and breakfast. Try the patty melt, you won't be sorry.   The best thing about this establishment is the amazing staff. Everyone is really friendly and they make sure you have everything you need.   It's great to have a place to go in Las Vegas that feels like a small hometown bar.",

    "text": "Distill Bar is the old Agave.  The decor hasn't changed much but didn't really need to.  Got here early - around 5.  Wasn't too busy.  Had couple drinks at the bar - my friend won $20 bucks :) - and then sat at a high top table just a few feet away when my other 2 friends arrived.  The one thing that stood out for me was the staff.  Positive attitude and attentive.  From the bar to the table.  We ordered the chips and salsa ($1.99 happy hour) at the bar.  The salsa wasn't bad but the chips just wasn't like Agave when we ordered it was hot and freshly made.  We ordered the mashed potato bites, as we were told it was the most popular.  It was ok.  I guess I expected it to be more crispy on the outside.  I'll try the pretzels or the poppers next time.  Breakfast is served 24/7!  I asked our server for suggestions and settled on the steak and eggs breakfast.  ($11.99)  I forgot to advise how I wanted my steak cooked and wasn't asked so I got it well done.  Bummer as I'm a medium rare girl.  Eggs were cooked perfectly.  Steak was very thin, and had as much flavor as I would expect a well done thin steak to be.  Friend ordered the chicken fried steak special and it came with soup or salad, mashed potatoes and vegetables for $11.99.  He liked it.  Another friend ordered the chicken fried steak breakfast with the sauce on the side and that got confused - amazingly it took only a few minutes to have fresh one made.  The sauce was made with sausage.  Funny part was we had a hard time figuring out the \"sausage\" in the sauce and had to ask.  Our server didn't know and had to ask herself.   That being said it wasn't bad :)  The soup was a chicken and artichoke.  It came out - to me - barely warm.  It was my friend's soup and he was content with it.  But I like my soup hot.  Couldn't even see any steam.  My friend had the black and blue burger.  He loved it.  Gave it three thumbs up!  Seems to be the food of choice as I saw quite a few sliders and burgers at other tables.  I was just hoping the breakfast would've been better as most of the time you can't really mess that up.

    "text": "Finally got around to checking this place out and I'm glad we did. Made a point of sitting out on the patio, which has a great atmosphere. This inside does too, but the weather has been so great, it's a treat to sit outside while the breeze is blowing.   We came mid-week, after happy hour. I'd wanted to get here for happy hour, since the prices are incredible for that, but once I saw the very limited food options, I was okay with our arrival time. The patio was open and not too crowded. Erin was our server, and she was great from beginning to end (and we sat for awhile just chatting).  Specialty cocktails are always fun and we tried two of theirs:   Distiller's Delight -- bourbon-based, not too sweet, very refreshing. Probably my favorite of the two. Also tried the Mad Mule (without the simple syrup). This variation on the Moscow Mule is nice, but the addition of all the extra sugar would be too sweet. As it was, it was pretty sweet with a nice ginger bite at the end.   Food:  Shrimp Spinach Artichoke Dip  -- Bland, bland, bland and very watery. No cheese, no garlic, not even a bit of lemon juice to brighten it up. The shrimp tasted like the frozen precooked rubbery kind. Mixed in a bit of salsa with it just to choke it down. Told Erin about it and she said that sometimes it's bland and sometimes it's not, it depends on who is in the kitchen. Sorry, but a commercial kitchen ought to have the recipes perfected, especially when it's a basic 5 ingredient appy that has a bunch of 5-star recipe options all over the food websites.   Chicken Nachos -- Surprisingly good. Once again, not made particularly well, as the chips in the top center were covered in toppings, and then there were a pile of naked chips underneath, but the chicken was good (not spicy as advertised), the refried beans added a salty edge, the cheeses were pretty good, and the guacamole was very good. We used the salsa to save the spinach artichoke dip.   The chips on both dishes were good, but the items themselves came out only lukewarm, so they were cold halfway through. I've seen this comment on a couple of other reviews, so I think it's an issue with the kitchen.   Total bill for 2 drinks and 2 appetizers + tax/ tip/ etc. came to $50. Typical Summerlin prices.   All in all, I loved the atmosphere, the drinks and the nachos. Looked like there might be a few other items to try on the menu. And the inside of the restaurant looked really nice too. So we'll probably be back.",

    "text": "I'm giving Distill 5 stars because I had a great experience both times I went and plan on going back soon. My roommate and I wanted to go out and try something new. We saw the free whiskey shot with check in offer and figured why not? The first time we came, I ordered the coffee infused whiskey and my roommate got the orange cinnamon infused. We agreed that the orange cinnamon was more our style so that's what we will be ordering from now on. Happy hour is definitely a good deal. $1.99 chips and salsa, $2.99 bruschetta, and $3 well drinks...yum! The chips and salsa were a great deal for only 2 dollars. Spicy salsa and a bunch of chips! As for the bruschetta, the bread was delicious and crispy, good enough to eat alone. But the tomato/onion topping also goes great with it! We ordered fries too that aren't considered happy hour. Just normal cut fries with a hint of salt for about $3. Both of us love fries so we have to try fries at every place we go, and they were pretty tasty here. The well drinks were also a good deal! $3 for a whiskey and ginger ale. They bring it on the rocks though, so next time I will ask for it chilled. Sitting outside just makes my ice melt and waters the drink down. But speaking of the outside..it's wonderful and where we choose to dine every time. They have nice high top tables, and lower seating with couches lining the patio area. Cute fire places and lantern hanging lights. Both times we went was during happy hour but I would come back during regular hours too. It's open 24/7 so we were thinking about trying it in the early morning sometime. The staff was excellent both visits too. Friendly and fast service. One of the waitresses even remembered us from the first time and came over to say hi. All in all a great place. (Both of us are vegetarians/vegans)",

So when I show up during the week to have dinner it took 20 minutes to get water another 10 mins to get a server to realize we are even there and then another 15 mins to get drink. The food is decent and forget asking for refills because that takes another 10 mins. Plan on going on the weekends? Well I did and it took just as long to get a drink. Our waitress forgot about us and when she finally realized we ordered drinks she made another waitress serve us. So sad that a cool urban bar is just another waste of space",

But he did say they have a great ventilation system. But we still smelled smoke. It's too bad, it has good food but I'm not asking for a side of cancer.",

    "text": "This place is amazing because it offers a lot of things other bars/restaurants don't in the area - 1. Out doors patio with cozy fire pits and live music on Saturdays.  2. High ceilings so if you don't like smoking you never smell it ever in this place. 3. Saturday and Sunday Brunch that beats any on the strip and don't have to wait in long lines. 4. Several pool tables to challenge your friends to a game. 5. Cozy large man cave chairs to set back and enjoy some football with your crew. 6. Many areas to handle large parties even when not planned because the owner is always around and is happy to make any occasion special. 7. The food is above the normal bar menu ( salmon,shrimp,pizza hand made to order,street tacos) endless choices. 8. Happy hour/football specials (monday,Sunday, Saturday,Thursday) menus. Stop in and say Hello you won't be disappointed!",

    "text": "Two things you need to know off the bat.  First, 21 and above only; no problem.  Second, SMOKE SMOKE SMOKE everywhere; gross.  Went to the opening last night, and it was packed and loud, but a good vibe and crowd.  There was a band playing, but after talking with one of the owners that won't be an \"everyday\" thing, at least not for now.  Even though it was busy, the servers were quick and prompt and very very friendly and upbeat.  The decor is warmer and more inviting than when this place was Agave, with a lot of lounge chairs and tables replacing the old table booths.  The patio is still there and will be a welcome place to hangout in the warmer weather.  There is also a game room area, with video bowling, golfing, pool table, etc.  And, the \"jukebox\" is pretty cool, with the ability to sync to your iPhone and music playlists.  And of course plenty of  TVs throughout to catch your fave sporting event.  This morning we decided to try out breakfast, since we were running errands in the area.  We sat in the main bar area, and my first impression was \"I don't want to eat in a place that all I can smell is cigarette smoke.\"  It's just not appealing.  It didn't seem so smokey the night before, but this morning was a different story.  The menu looks good, and they serve breakfast 24/7.  My husband had the build your own breakfast burrito (sausage, spinach, tomato and cheese), and they forgot the sausage.  I had the patty melt and it was \"meh\".  Not great.  Not horrible.  I ordered a bloody mary...let's just say it needs work.  Like, a lot of work.  I don't know what I had, but it was no where close to a bloody mary, lacking in taste and \"zip.\"  Our waitress seemed nervous, and I'll chalk it up to the place only being open for 2 days.  But first impression, she had the personality of a log.  On a side note, the manager came over and introduced herself and was very welcoming, perky and nice.  Like I said, I'll chalk it up to nerves and the newness of it all.  This place has the potential to be a great locals hangout, and the owners are experienced restauranteurs/tavern/grill operators.  We'll give it a month to work out the kinks and go back and give it another go.  However, it'll have to be on the patio to avoid as much smoke as possible (if I want smoke with my food and drink, I'll go the casino across the street, or to the Irish bar at Boca Park; point is, Summerlin doesn't need another smokey bar/grill).  And, maybe I'll hand the bartender a good bloody mary recipe while I'm at it.  I do hope this place does well either way.",

    "text": "The drinks were a bit small & watered down for the price but the burger I had was pretty good!  Upon the recommendation of other yelpers, we also got the potato appetizer.  VERY good.  A friend also ordered the fried mozzarella & that was also tasty.  The waitress we had was friendly & was quite attentive in the beginning but as time went on, we had a hard time finding her & she forgot a few drinks people had ordered.  I will say that I was super impressed that with our large party, they had no problems with splitting the check up.  A lot of places scoff at you for asking but they were great about it.  We'll go back if we're invited but I can't see us going there purposefully without someone requesting it or a fantastic special of some type.",

They'll wait a long time to take my order so they can order my food and drink at the same time. Or bring my food before drinks. Or not offer water before taking my order. The place would be great if they had their wait staff properly trained. Which is really a problem with management. Servers please read the proper process: greet your customers and offer them water, then come back and take their drink order, then come take their food order, then come back and check that things came out correctly and that your customer needs nothing else. It's called \"customer service\", and it means exactly what it is called. I'd love to see service improved , so I can change my rating.",
