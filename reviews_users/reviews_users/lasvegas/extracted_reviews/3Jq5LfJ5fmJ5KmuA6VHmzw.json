    "text": "I spent 2-3 hours here with a couple of friends. None of us have any meaningful golf experience but we all had a blast. 5 stars.   Food is typical pub fare: wings, pizza, etc. Great drinks, lots of TVs. Not exactly fine dining but it's not supposed to be. Totally met our expectations. 5 stars.  The top floor is totally child-free (21+) which is major plus for guys like me who actively avoid the presence of children. 5 stars for any establishment that offers child-free options !   Price for a bay on top floor was $100/hr + $270 food and drink minimum (for three people), so make sure you come hungry!  We did have one peculiar experience with our server though, and it's the the only reason for the three star review:  We had only used $170 of our $270 minimum not long before leaving, so we figured we'd use the remaining $100 on some to-go items. But our server Ruby H. went into panhandling mode, asking if we'd like to donate that $100 to \"feed the staff,\" implying that they apparently aren't paid enough money to feed themselves. I found this to be grossly inappropriate.  My friend politely declined and ordered a pizza and some other items to go. Server Ruby became argumentative at that point, claiming that it would be silly for us to spend that $100 on ourselves since the pizzas would \"never keep\" for any length of time anyway. She really fought tooth and nail with my friend, insisting that our $100 be  used to \"feed the staff\". Not to state the obvious, but she likely had no interest in feeding her coworkers; She clearly just wanted to feed *herself* using someone else's money.   I suspect she tried to retaliate by adding a number of bogus items to our bill.  It was a truly surreal experience. We asked to speak with the manager, Miguel. He was apologetic and comp'd us a free hour of golf. He cleared out the bogus charges and stated he'd speak with server about her behavior.   Manager also made it official: Aggressive panhandling by the servers is NOT allowed. This was presumably an isolated incident.  Strange experience with our server notwithstanding, it was a positive outing overall. Final recap: Pay the extra money for the top floor private bay. Totally worth it. Come hungry. If your server is Ruby H., watch out for panhandling at checkout time, and double-check your bill!",

    "text": "I was in town for a conference and came here for lunch the other day with colleagues. I have to say I really like the layout of the place. When you first walk in it feels like you are checking your bags into the airport, with the long line and people zig zagging. When you walk past it, you can see a large row of seats laid out liked a bowl alley and behind it were some seating space kind of like a lounge with a bar. There was this big ass TV, which was 16 ft high and 24 ft wide from what I remembered when I asked about it.   We ended up dining on the 3rd floor in one of the booths and we ordered a bunch of food like buffalo wings, sliders, burgers, salad and pizza. Just a little bit of everything. Everything to be honestly was incredibly delicious. Top notch, the only thing I didn't like that the waitresses recommended were the fish sliders. I got the Memphis burger and I could be bias because I love PB&J but this burger was the best PB&J burger I ever had in my life and it came with a side of tater tots. Basic PB with raspberry jalapeno jelly with smoked pork belly and white cheddar. Delicious combo. I've had other PB&J burgers before and this one is for sure my favorite.  Now in regards to the golfing experience, I believe you pay by the hour and depending on what time of the day it is will determine the rate. The range is 200 yards long and there are targets you aim for to get points. There's a sensor in the ball that keeps track of where your ball and it will calculate the points depending on where it lands. My group did not consist of many coordinated people but when they were able to land a clean hit, it was a big deal and that made it very fun.   The only issue is that it did get pretty chilly. I can see why all the waitresses were all wearing insulted jackets. Aside from that, I genuinely enjoyed my time here and can't wait to go back with a large group of friends. I wish I had taken more pictures to post but when you are having a good time, your phone should be set aside.",

Very slow to get our initial orders taken and delivered, yet we were repeatedly reminded before and during our event about our minimum spend.   Multiple servers were downright rude and arrogant (they switched our main server during the event as the first one was ending her shift at 6pm so we had 2).   We did not hit our minimum spend, which was fine so we figured we would just pay the difference - all good.....but as we were going thru our bill to settle up the server gave me an odd request to allow her to put more items in on our bill because they were running some kind of server contest and it would \"help me out a lot\". She was very rude (when she actually showed up to our stall) to begin with - I just said \"do whatever you need to do - we want to pay our bill and go\". Just an odd and IMO greedy staff, based on our 2+ hours there.   There was a bus boy that came by a lot and he was very nice and attentive - a shake he wasn't our server!   I've been to other Top Golf's (ie Atlanta, Dallas) and it was nothing like this. I'm going to chalk it up to the lousy culture of Las Vegas strip - but either way won't be back here again.",

However in my most recent experience, my one hour quoted time became two hours before I canceled when they quoted us another 30 minutes. At one hour, I was quoted for another 20 minutes which was not close either. I understand it's an estimate but with it being over double the time (I'll never know the True amount), we wasted a lot of time. If you have nothing schedule, by all means it's a fun place but with a high price tag and my latest experience, I definitely do not believe they're on top of their golf game.",

    "text": "I have mixed feelings about Topgolf... There are definitely many pros but there are cons as well. I'll tell you both. The parking situation is terrible. If I was not here for date with the Mr, once experiencing the ridiculous parking situation, I would just go elsewhere. BUT as Topgolf put a dent in my vibe, I did not want to ruin the vibe for my honey so I kept it together. The parking lot is under construction so there is NO parking there. You have an option of parking at the MGM, which is a 0.5 mile walk OR attempt utilizing the valet which will likely be full, as it was for us. A chance for valet being full is pretty high since they are only able to take about 10 cars and the only other option is 0.5 mile away. So, dressed for date night, I had to walk 0.5 miles in 100 degree weather AND pay for parking at MGM. As much as Topgolf charges, it's unacceptable. There is a shuttle running between Topgolf and MGM but there are no signs anything else letting you know where it is or that it's even available, so good luck finding it. After having my soul irritated by the parking situation and walking from MGM, we came inside to be treated by very friendly staff. Straight from the door smiling faces were saying hello and directing us where to go.  There are different levels with different pricing. Levels 1 &2  are $15 cheaper and cater more to families. Level 3 is 21+, has a bar, and better views. We opted for level 3 ($75/hr on a Monday). Each section has a leather sectional with some throw pillows and a table. Cool vibe. We ordered some food and drinks which were pretty good but I found to be a bit pricey. The Mr. ordered a wing app that came with 6 wings that carried a $13 price tag...  I am not a golf player so this was a pretty new experience for me. There were several club options which were divided between men's (left) and women's (right) sections. After trying out a few clubs, i found the right one for me and actually scored some points! Who knew golf can be fun? Or may be golf + cocktails is fun? Either way, we had a blast!  The concept of Topgolf is awesome. I just feel that at this price tag they should take better care of their customers, even with parking lot issues, it could have been better managed/organized.",

You can do so much at Top Golf, obviously you can come play golf, drink, watch a game, and then hit the pool. I also really liked their pro shop.  The only cons were the service and food, we waited about 10 minutes at a table and no one came up to us to ask us for our order or give us water. I had to go hail someone for this. Secondly, I ordered the chilaquiles and they were awful. Chilaquiles are supposed to be a warm breakfast option but here they were basically cold nachos. I honestly wanted to send them back but just settled on eating a few bites and letting them be.  I'll definitely be back for the entertainment but will probably choose to eat beforehand.",

    "text": "This was our first TopGolf experience and there were mostly positives to highlight in my review. Let's start with the good - 1) the music, atmosphere and open layout are inviting, 2) the staff is knowledgeable and polite, 3) their beverage and food menu is all-encompassing, and priced well. They heavily advertise the injectable donuts which looked appealing but we ordered the cast iron cookie skillet with fresh berries and a huge scoop of vanilla bean ice cream- consensus was \"AMAZING!\" 4) we ended up on Level 1 for golfing, they have 3 levels and several bays per party. They have golf clubs for women and men segmented by distance (yards). The TV screens show your points and distance, you wave your golf club for the ball to drop down to you when you are ready to hit. Very fun and convenient way to golf!  Now...for the not so great aspect - you cannot pay and reserve a bay in advance, we arrived at 4:49pm on a Saturday hoping to beat the crowd but were told it would be almost 2hrs before we could golf!!?! Whoa, well this sucks when you plan a double date night and have a babysitter waiting at home charging by the hour. Lol. The text-back waiting list is nice but maybe TopGolf operations and revenue should consider the ability to pay and reserve a bay by app/phone. This would also allow players to see when next available is so they can plan their night accordingly. Tourists have nothing but time to sit, socialize and drink during their wait time - but us locals need to maximize our time. Haha! Just a thought.  We all enjoyed ourselves overall but the wait time was a sticking point. We'd return but would understand time may be an issue.",

There's plenty of outdoor and indoor seating, multiple bars, cornhole, a pool, and private golf bays with a spectacular view of the Strip. To do Topgolf right, come with a group of friends to lessen the sting on your wallet. Six people can golf per bay, but spectators are welcome in the bay at no additional cost. It was $75 an hour for our bay on the third floor. We ended up staying for two hours.   GOOD TO KNOW: 1) Smoking is only allowed on the 4th floor. 2) Reservations are wise - a friend in our group was wise enough to take care of this, otherwise the wait would have been a 2 hour wait on a Thursday evening for a golf bay on the third floor! 3) No self-parking is available. 4) There's an ATM on the first floor outside.   My group started on the bar at the fourth floor for some grub. Our bartenders, Lindsay and another young woman whose name escapes me (she was a vegetarian with a colorful half-sleeve), were amazing! Lindsay was hilarious and took care of us. When my husband's meal came 15 minutes after mine, a manager comped us a round of beers. All in all pretty awesome customer service.  GRILLED PORTABELLA ($12): I switched out the vinegar chips for tater tots, which were awesome with the dipping sauce provided. The apples and arugula on the burger broke up the richness of the brie and the portabella mushroom. This burger was A-OK. I'll probably try the flatbread next time. 3/5  MUSHI ($14): My husband got this upon recommendation of our bartender. He loved it and presentation was on point. It's a burrito sliced up and presented like sushi. Super cool. 5/5   I opted out of the actual golfing part, but hanging out in the bay watching everyone golf and knocking back some drinks was the highlight of my visit. Everyone in my group loved Topgolf. We cannot wait to come back!  YELP 100 CHALLENGE 2016: #49",

So we asked should we make a reservation next time and she informed us that they don't do reservations, it's first come first served and we should try to get there about thirty minutes before they open in the morning, which is ridiculous. Oh well..",

The servers were very very sweet & attentive and were very professional & detailed in their help. We were greeted right away by someone when we walked through, and were shown where our party was without any hassle. Overall, very very satisfied!",

Its a cool concept that makes the driving range/golf fun, its like playing a fully interactive video game. You can do the typical hit golf balls as far as you can, but they have several other challenges/games to play based on accuracy to range. The equipment here is super up to date and modern and the golf clubs they provide are more then adequate (you can bring your own if you want). The range/game system is easy to use and the staff do a great job explaining it. The staff here were all very good, well informed and attentive to the guests. service gets 5 stars in my book. Each bay/tee comes with table service to get drinks and food which I would recommend. You can have up to 6 people to share the space so its great hang out spot when you get tired of the clubs/bars/casinos and want some fresh air There are plenty of televisions to stay update on the sports going on and they have a lounging pools and music stage with live music from time to time. This place really changed my mind on golf/driving range and I would gladly go back as it was a ton of fun. One of the highlights my visit to las vegas",

    "text": "GOLFERS BEWARE...  I should have know from my elite Yelp event here that there were issues however I was optimistic that since this place has been open for a few weeks some of those issues would have been resolved.   LMAO NOPE!   First off we arrive and no valet parking onsite no parking onsite at all.  I do realize that miss USA needed a tent and that wasn't the issue.  The issue lies with having to take a shuttle wasting 20-30 minutes each way. It took the same amount of time for shuttle service than it did when driving from my house!  And yes it's a 106 out. No shuttle stop with a place to sit and the top golf employees didn't understand how the shuttle systems operates.  One guy told us it's an as needed or on demand shuttle so we would have to tell the valet guy.  So we went to the valet guy and he was told two shuttles running with additional stops.    When we got there we did find our party by the pool.  Which I was told I need a wrist band not sure for what reason but I did know there are a ton on minimum charges for pool and golf depending on the floor and time of day but between three different employees and again ranges of different prices. My friend got the manager and it was somewhat resolved.  I get it it's Vegas that means charging for everything.  If you want to sit by the pool without a bay it's a charge or the bay is a charge then the food and beverage minimum by the pool or bay on the third and fourth floors with a two hour minimum charge for play time.  I get that part but why does no one know their prices!!!! I mean come on they work there.  What a joke.   My biggest complaint is the lack of communication.  I'm talking communication between staff and their lack of knowledge.  Everyone told us a different story.  This is the same complaint I had during my elite Yelp event. The difference there was I overlooked it since it was free event.",

We came in on Monday evening and the place wasn't that busy and it still took our waiter 20 minutes to take our drink order.  The food was okay, but not worth the price.  Overall,  I don't see myself returning until this place service and menu updates.",

We reserved 3 bays and cabanas by the pool and gave us ample space to play and lounge. Food was decent, with a few gusta of wind hot apps got cold quickly, but with such excellent service with drink orders no one but this event manager seemed to mind. The game itself is fantastic and not intimidating to non golf players which is ideal for corporate events. Overall I recommend.  Event management services: 5/5 Service: 10/5 - seriously the staff they had working our bays were super friendly and on top of it 100%. Really made my guests feel well taken care of  Food: 3/5 Place: 5/5, bays by the cabanas on the third floor are the best!",

As an avid golfer and someone who works in the golf industry, I was curious to see what all the hype was about.   First off, it wasn't too busy out front for valet on a Friday night at 5pm but I can see how it could be a crazy mess. There were a lot of open bays as well for the golf part, so it wasn't too crowded at this time. Plenty of staff people around, most just patiently waiting for someone to show up.   I would have to agree with another reviewer, this is probably someplace to go to kill and hour or two and drop a couple hundred bucks. Not sure its more than that, or some kind of lifechanging experience. From a golfer standpoint, I'd rather go to any other driving range and hit a $8 bucket of balls. The holes in the middle are quite large, and with the synthetic grass or carpet, your ball is bound to bounce into one somewhere. On the positive side, they do have Callaway XR irons and woods to play with.  Overall my impression was, not worth what they charge. I doubt I'll be back.",

    "text": "This is my first Top Golf experience and I was blown away.  I am a Las Vegas local for part of the year.    Easy entrance can be found just off of Koval, between Tropicana and Harmon.  The parking lot is huge and valet is there at specific times (when it is busy I would guess...it was not available when I showed up a noon on a Thursday).   As a general patron, I was impressed by the size of this place, the four extensive floors, the big bars (two total!), the pretty pool, ample shade and hospitable staff.    As a local, without any charge to enter the facility, you could come on in, drink at the bar, people watch the golfers and even eat a meal.  The bartender informed us that we could even take a swim if we wanted.  We had lunch and enjoyed a really great meal!  All items were fresh, creative and tasty, especially the rock shrimp appetizer.  Food was about $10-15 an option and a beer set us back $7.50 a piece.    There are air conditioned parts of the facility, but the place for the most part is outside, heavily covered with fans and misters about.  Even in 115 degree heat, I was surprised I did not feel hotter than I should, considering it was noon when I was there.    As a golfer, I was impressed by their golf set up.  After lunch, we then paid to play for an hour, which for the two of us, was $30 a person, plus $5 for a little membership of sorts (this part is optional).  Rates vary based on time of day, floor level and maybe day of week (not certain).  First floor was more kid friendly, so it would be my rule to stay away (LOL!).  They were busy at noon on a Thursday, but there was no wait and we easily were able to eat, drink and play some golf.    After you check in for your specific numbered spot at the front desk, a host will show you to your golf area.  You pay for your time after you play, not before when you get your spot.  Couches, bar/food server, Callaway club selections (for both men and women....although you can bring your own clubs as well).  The yardage and games are all controlled via a computer screen and their golf Top Golf technology.  Hit the ball and your yardage is recorded on the computer screen behind you.  It keeps your score as you play with a partner or a group.  The hour goes by quickly and it is easy to see how your tab could rise quickly...just kind of know this before you go.    This place I thought was awesome though, as a patron and a golfer.  I was really impressed.  I was advised that this is their cream of the crop locations in the Top Golf family of facilities across the USA, because of four floors and pool, amongst other things.  To do with friends, a group or just my spouse, I would enjoy going back and look forward to doing so in the near future.",

They have about 3 different levels, the higher the level the more you pay to play golf. Each level has a bar so you never have to wait long to order a drink. The food and drinks are average for the strip, but they might be a bit high for locals. Mix drinks start at $14 and bottle service at $500. This place is like nothing here in vegas. They have a small area for a live band and a pool!! And the view at night time is awesome! This is a great place for all ages specially adults! There are tons of Tvs to watch the games, you can play bags, JINYA and even place bets at the sport's book. This place hasn't been open for long so there are still some issues, but hopefully they can fix them soon!",

    "text": "I came here May 13th for the Andrew McMahon concert so this review is based solely on my concert experience - I did not golf during this visit.  I called ahead for the set times because their website only had 7:30pm listed but it was not clear if that was when the first band went on or if that's when doors would open. When I called they refused to give me the set times and just said the doors WOULD OPEN AT 7:30pm so I took that as a \"arrive at 7:30p and the event would start at 8pm\"  When we arrived at 7:30pm, the Valet was full and after 20 mins we decided no one was leaving and the only choice was to PAY to park at MGM and then take the free shuttle. We parked at MGM by 8pm only for there to be no free shuttle so we walked over and finally made it into the venue at 8:30pm to find out the second band was already performing. Great! This is why I wanted estimate set times so I wouldn't miss the first two bands.  Only the staff member holding the venue entrance door was polite the staff accepting the tickets were so rude. When we got to the bar all the bartenders were busy but instead of asking us to wait or thanking us for waiting they just ignored us until they had nothing better to do. When we finally got one of the bartenders attention she gave us attitude for my friend having a top golf gift card - why does that matter? you're getting paid either way.  Finally, Andrew performed and he was amazing of course. The security staff to the left of the stage was kind enough to move the trash can to let me stand against the barricade so I could watch the band with a decent view as I couldn't find a good view due to being late and short in height.  After the show we stayed for dinner at the bar and our server/bartender was new and actually really awesome. I hope I never have to go back here for a concert ever again but would like to try golfing or something else if the opportunity is given.",

    "text": "So, I don't play golf but you don't really need to know how to if you come to TopGolf. It would help, though, if someone in your party knows how to play so you can get pointers.  We came here on a Sunday at 10:00am and got a 2nd floor bay for our party of four.  My boyfriend knows how to play golf and so do our friends, so I got a mini-tutorial on how to swing the clubs enough to enjoy myself.   This is a unique entertainment venue with four floors of hitting bays that are climate-controlled so you won't sweat to death in the summer time.  There seemed to be a bar everywhere we looked, plus two swimming pools, and an area where you can watch sports on huge screens.  Our bay had two comfortable couches to sit upon as well as our own TV screen and another one that kept track of our golf game.  The staff was very friendly and very attentive the entire time.  We had a glitch with our game at the start where it wasn't registering one of the players' scores so an IT guy came and fixed it and we were comped for the time that was lost.  The food was enjoyable, too, with shared orders of tater tots and the Injectable Donut Holes (of course).  I also had the Ketel One Mule and it was a really good Mule.  The others in our party had more food, but I can't speak to their dishes other than the fact that they ate them all up.   I was definitely wowed by this place and I can't wait to bring my dad, who is also a golf player.  Even though you may not play golf, you can still come here to hang out, have a drink and a bite, watch some games on the screens, and just chill.",

We decided to wait. We arrived at 3pm & still at our table at 8pm, with no bay to golf. We finally decided to leave after being told it would be an additional hour. Spoke to the manager Abigail, and she provided us no assistance. We even asked if they could accommodate for a different day, and they too provided no help. I like the venue, but TERRIBLE customer service!!! Such a shame, since we definitely had high hopes for this place !!",

They greeted us and guided us to the rest of the group and had us on our 3 bays within minutes.   The information and instructions from the staff were clear and helpful. Then they immediately took our drink orders and basically made sure no one had an empty glass for the rest of the night!   The food was extraordinary. We had a little buffet for our group and it included all types of meat, mac n cheese and salads! I can't say enough about the food, it's just so good!  The tvs are plentiful and the staff was very willing to put on any channel we requested, and we made a few of them!   A special shoutout goes to Dana, our head server, she was a superstar and just 100% dialed into our group and was extremely friendly. Probably the most efficient server I've had in years anywhere. (That's saying a lot considering we're big foodies!)  I absolutely love this place and have been begging for HQ to come to SoCal!   Go see this place next time you're in Vegas. It's a great break from the casinos, it's fun, amazing food and excellent service. Ask for Dana.",

Think bowling and target practice you are half way there.  My server (Michelle) was great and the sliders I had for lunch were very good!   I played for an hour and that was plenty.  If I had played with a group, it might take longer.  Levels 1&2 are family oriented, level 3 is adult only and includes a bar and a pool.  Level 4 is more for parties and VIP needs.    Fun place, moderately priced by Vegas standards, a good way to socialize with a fun activity.  I will definitely go again with a group to maximize the value!",

    "text": "Topgolf is amazing & so much fun. Even if golf isn't your thing, it's still a great time and worth checking out. Yes, they have a few flaws/kinks, hence the 4 stars. But if they can get them worked out, and I think they will, this is easily a 5 star review.   So what is topgolf?  It's a driving range, with a bit of bowling and darts influence. The range is set up in bays. Each bay can accommodate up to 6 players (or non players).  Each bay is equipped with a scoring monitor facing the group, a TV with choice of 12 channels, a scoring monitor for the golfer, a couch & table, right handed male/female golf club (left handed are available upon request), and a charging station where you can plug in your phone (charger or USB cable required).   Each bay has an assigned hostess. Who will take your drink & food orders and follow up to see if you'd like to extend your play time.   The scoring monitor is touch screen, and allows you to choose the next player. Each player can hit as many balls as they like to. Once done, choose the next player.  This is great if your companions go MIA, haha.   To get a ball, the player waves their club over a sensor, which dispenses a microchipped ball associated with the player. The player then hits the ball, and the scoring  monitor displays where the ball landed in the driving range (based on the microchip location).   The driving range has a series of pins, with zones setup similar to darts. The closer to the pin you land, the more points you earn. Also, distance earns points.   The scoring monitor allows you to choose from multiple games, where you can work on distance, short game, or just earn points by landing in points zones. For more information on the games, consult the website or the scoring monitor, or ask a hostess at topgolf.   Fees to use the bay's are based on hours played. It's the same cost for 1-6 players in the bay. And can range from $30-70 per hour depending on the time and day. Check website for pricing.    Other cool things topgolf offers:  2 pools with a swim bar.  Beer pong  Cornhole boards  Plenty of seating. From chairs to couches to weird chairs to ottomans.  4 levels - level 1/2 kid friendly 3/4 21+  Several bar locations.  Server service with food/drink anywhere in the facility  Free entrance. So if you have friends playing, no fee to hangout.   The flaws/kinks: These may have been due to opening weekend & can be easily overcome with a little training & staffing. Btw, I won't let these flaws keep me from coming back...just including them in my review for full disclosure.   1) Mandatory valet. I'm all for valet, but it's unnecessary in a parking lot this small. Furthermore, they don't have enough staff to park the cars in a timely fashion, which results in cars blocking Koval waiting to get in. The through lanes were blocked both times I visited, making it difficult for those taking a cab/Uber to drop off/pick up.  Note: if you are on the strip, you can either walk here or take the free shuttle from mgm. Shuttle run times are listed on the website.   2) The scoring monitors are a bit glitchy. It is a new establishment. So I think they're working this out. We had an issue with our monitor, and the hostess credited the 15 minutes we had to wait. She was very friendly and handled it quickly.   3) Staff knowledge. Again, this will work itself out with time. When I asked about the use of the pool & fees, I was given different answers. The first guy said you have to rent a cabana, which didn't add up for me as there were plenty of non-cabana lounge chairs. The second person didn't know. And the third person said they thought customers can purchase a wrist band or rent a cabana, but didn't know pricing & told me to talk to group reservations. The group reservations desk was busy, so I never got a straight answer. Prices for the golfing are listed on the checkin board, but not for pool use. The other lack of knowledge happened when we ordered donut holes for dessert, which come with choice of 2 fillings but for $1 more can try all 3. We ordered all 3, but the hostess wasn't aware that was a menu option.",

It was a little on the pricey side (but I have to remember it was a Saturday evening in Vegas). I would recommend this Top Golf.",

    "text": "Pretty fun way to kill some time in Vegas if you want to get away from the traditional vices for a bit.  Especially recommended if you're a golfer like me, although judging by people's swings  I suspect that many patrons here are not golfers.  Pros:    -Beautiful facility, places to lounge and TVs playing sports everywhere.  This is probably a good place to come just to watch a basketball or football game. -Climate controlled hitting bays (wasn't too hot in the hitting bay even on a 110 degree day). -Golf games are pretty fun, I recommend Topgolf and Topchip. -Contrary to some other reviews, the service I received was pretty good.  Drinks came quickly and they explained the system and games pretty well.  I went at a non-peak time though (about 4 pm on a Sunday).  I think this place gets a lot busier at night.  -Tip:  you choose how long you want to play, but if you want to stay longer, you can extend in 15 minute increments.  So don't feel pressured to finish a game right on time, you can extend without having to pay a whole additional hour. -Tip:  clubs are provided, and they are actually decent clubs.  However, I'd recommend bringing your own golf glove.   Cons:  -Valet parking is not located right at the Topgolf entrance.  Valet is located about a 10 minute walk (or short shuttle ride) away from the entrance.  Maybe we lucked out, but we didn't have to wait long for a shuttle at all.  If you don't want to valet, you can park in the MGM self-parking lot adjacent to the valet; however, I think this might be a pay lot.  It was free when I went, but that might have been because it was a Sunday. -A little pricey for what it is, and kind of lame that they charge more to be on the 3rd floor (with a slightly better view of the targets).   -$5/person for a \"membership\".  Not a huge deal, but I wish I had known about this beforehand. -Golf system is a little glitchy but not terrible.  Some of the shots (especially shots that did not land in a target) did not register in the system.  The targets do not distinguish whether you hit a shot with a nice arc straight into the target, or you hit a terrible shot that happens to bounce into a target.  Not sure if there's a way to correct that.  But overall, not a huge deal esp if your goal is just to have some fun with some friends.",

She checked in every 10 minutes it felt like. We got appetizer wings and tots and she did a great job inputting how she felt about what was on the menu. Both were fantastic tasting. We had two friends who didn't golf agreeing it'd be dangerously fun if we had one of these in San Diego. It truly makes golf a fun sport just like how bowling is.

It is pricey, but it is still packed so maybe they hit the right pricing range like Disneyland. 2. It is fun to golf and be able to watch college or pro football however they have fox and ESPN but no pac-12 network. 3. We came here for an event that was three hours and we were suppose to check in at the event booth and escorted to the event area however we spent 20 minutes waiting and missing our event and ended up just walking and looking for our event! Most of the people at top golf seem like they obviously don't play golf, food and drinks were good, waitresses were friendly and helpful. It is kind of nice the balls are chipped and if you hit it in any of the hole areas it shows up on the screen!",

Assuming your paying customers time is not valuable speaks volumes about management. They bank on the fact that most will wait 1-2 hours because they've already made the trip. They'd rather have people sitting around waiting (building hype like a club I suppose) than give the courtesy of a wait time. A/C units above the bay are just for show. The staff is friendly but incompetent. Everything we ordered took forever to arrive and several items were way off the mark. Actually hitting the balls and competing with friends was fun but overall I wouldn't recommend this place. I won't be back. If you'd like to sit around in the Vegas heat with high hopes and have your low expectations not met I suggest having a yard sell.",

We first went to the bar on the first floor to get a drink. The bar was empty yet we were ignored by the bartender until we finally went to the upstairs bar. It was also not busy and took over 10 minutes to get our drinks. After we signed up to rent a bay we decided we would order food while we waited the over or under hour that was estimated. We sat at a couch with a menu and watched servers walk by but not one asked us if we wanted to order. The waitresses seemed just walked around in pods. We were sitting there with menus in our hands trying to get someone's attention. It was not busy at all and completely over staffed yet not one person interacted with us. 15 minutes and our pod is ready!!! We were stoked! When we went to check into our bay we were ignored until we finally decided to leave. The whole time I was there I felt like was begging to spend money.",

    "text": "The Top Golf experience itself is great. This would've been 5 stars if it was just left at that. But the staff/service is pretty... Meh. I'll start with the good.  Good! The actual premise is awesome, and a lot of fun. Enough space for you and your friends to not be bumping shoulders with other groups. The Golf process itself is entertaining. Free WiFi. The food is fantastic. Live music.  Meh. We had an expense-paid trip from my company, so I probably would have been more pissed if it were my dollar being spent. We paid for the more expensive 3rd floor area, and were  told that it supported up to 6 people hitting balls at the same time, as we didn't want to do the whole bowling thing where we all waited while one person went. The staff put us on the second floor anyway, and somehow were convinced that it was the 3rd floor, even after we asked (and, yanno, the giant staircase leading up). Given that, it only gave us enough time (2 hours slot) to go through one game.  While the food itself was great, the actual process of getting it was not so much. Our waitress bungled our order not once, but twice. First was simply a burger mistake, someone wanted medium well, it was medium rare (and marked as such). Honestly, I usually overlook this, but it got sent back. Second, we had an order of Sashimi. They returned with a $75 plate of tacos. Nobody really questioned it, as again, it was the company's dollar and we were certain someone ordered it. After asking around, we realized nobody had. When asked, the waitress said we never ordered sashimi in the first place. Huh? By that time we didn't want to waste precious time, so we just went with it (The tacos were great, really. But not the point). It's entirely possible that this could be due to the (While lovely) live music, which is REALLY loud. Like, my throat hurt at the end of the night because all talking must be done at the top of your lungs, including ordering.  We also weren't notified that you shouldn't enter players names while someone is playing, or their swings will go onto whoever is editing. It screwed up the first 2-3 balls of our game because one person put their info in and started hitting while the rest of us put our info in.  I highly recommend it, and I'll go again. Just be forewarned that it will be expensive, and possibly frustrating. When something is 'pay by hour', getting orders wrong and having system issues is literally cutting into your wallet and fun.",

There are different choices for games but we chose Top Golf.  You aim for targets and get points based on where you land!  Food and drinks were also amazing!  You get a bay (just like a bowling lane) and can order food and drinks right there!  Super fun and I recommend it whether you play golf or not!",

It ranges from about $50-75/hour depending on the level you choose, but each bay fits up to 6 people so it's not too bad after splitting the cost. I would say level 3 wasn't that much of a difference for an extra $12/hour, so I would stick with level 2 next time. Keep in mind that weekend waits can go up to 3 hours, weekdays are much better.",

    "text": "Local non-profit, Create A Change, had a private fundraising event on the top floor last week.  We lucked out on great weather to enjoy the evening.  The top floor is mostly outdoor with covering over the seating / golf area.  There are two separate quarters that were enclosed with AC, the entrance from where the elevator and escalator lands as well as a private VIP room at the opposite end.  Despite a few hundred attendees, the staff were friendly and in good spirits.  Immediately after the check in desk, two cocktail waitresses were passing trays of vodka tonic.  Solid way to set the tone of the party.  As a full book out, there were 2 buffet spreads in the main area, a large full bar, and servers all around to take drink orders.  There were walking entertainers including a fantastic Austin Powers (Yeahhhh, groovy baby!)  impersonator and we got to see some incredible street magic by a strolling magician named Cameron who ripped and restored dollar bills, turns a coin into a real rose which he gifted to me, and he managed to get our $1 inside a full bottle water when we clearly saw it pressed on the outside a second before!  In the VIP room, there are 2 lanes, a private restroom, a large L shaped couch with the ladies from the Fantasy show mingling with guests as well as a golf coach named Brandon helping guests with choosing clubs and giving pointers / instructions to whomever was on the tee.  This was definitely the highlight of our evening as about 40+ guests were surprisingly civil in rotating in and out of the 2 lanes to it out.    Initially, the Producer from Fantasy really broke the ice by stepping up, trying his hand at a few shots and having a great laugh about the ones that didn't go well.  After Brandon gave him some instructions, he hit a great shot and stopped on a high note to pass the club on.  At least 4 more ladies from the Fantasy show then stepped up and tried a few shots and got instructions.  There were some regular golfers occupying the other lane while one lane was mostly for people looking for instructions.    It was my 3rd time ever at a driving range.  Being completely inexperienced, I was really glad to see so many people that were not golfers giving it a try to give me the courage to step up and not feel embarrassed about driving the ball poorly.  My husband and I each hit about 15-20 golf balls throughout the night where we alternated between hitting 3-5 balls, leaving to get snacks and drinks, socialize, and then return to the tee 30mins later or when it became empty.    After some solid and professional advice from Brandon after each shot who corrected my form, hand grip, and patiently came up with various analogies to help me understand finding a natural golf swing vs brute power, I went from a bunch of mishaps like missing the ball, slicing it left and right, driving the ball to hit the interior's pillar padding to driving the ball consistently down 60-100ft!  My husband was really impressed with my progress and took Brandon's card to get me instructions in the future.  Our friends had a different section in the general area with a couch and 2 lanes.  There was also another instructor there who stood near the tee and were giving people pointers on their shots if they seemed receptive to it.  I think Top Golf had a good environment to allow golf enthusiasts to practice their swings as well as training their instructors really well to encouraged novices such as myself to not be shy and feel ok at working through the terrible shots to get better.  I didn't feel judged and we had a really great time!    If you ever want to spend an evening besides gaming and going to night clubs, I definitely recommend considering doing bottle service at Top Golf with a few friends and enjoy driving a few golf balls down range or getting lessons with Brandon.  The parking lot has a small drop off area with a large public lot but no valet and it is not patrolled by security, given the neighborhood near Koval, make sure you don't leave valuables visible in your car.  Many people simply Uber and Lyft and it was an easy drop off / pick up.",

(No, you don't need to know how to golf, everything's relaxed and calm). You can learn easily!   PS: Expect to wait for a bay Friday-Sunday nights. I've had to wait both times, but it's worth it.

    "text": "Great concept and execution on the golf side but my experience transitioning from waiting having drinks with friends to golf was poor.  The wait was two hours on a Friday night which was totally fine but when we got our slot I had to close my tab out. I wanted to close out so I went to the bar because the waitress would come around every 15 minutes or so which was plenty but I didn't want to lose golf time and not just stand there like a dummy. I went to the bar and asked to close out which I figured I could do because my card was on the POS system but she couldn't  pull it up so I had to hunt her down for the bill. When I finally got it I paid the bill tipped her and took the bill to the bar so it wouldn't get messed with. About thirty minutes later the waitress hunts me down on another level taps me on the shoulder and asks for the bill. I told her I took it to the bar.  I hope this is a isolated situation because the tradition to a timed session should be much smoother. I lost like 20 minutes of terribly swinging a club which I was fine with. Everyone was really nice and working their best. It sounds Like a POS system problem.  Drinks and food are well priced for Vegas.  Would I go back?  Yes Would I only pay with cash? Yes, I wouldn't have lost 20 minutes of golf.   Is the concept awesome? Yes Does the Transition of the POS system from patio bar to golf need work? Yes.",

Luckily we had a coupon from MGM. The first level is open to all ages. The upper levels are 21+. I wish we made a reservation bc the upper levels all had an hour wait time. We ended up going for the lower level and just waiting 10 minutes.  The staff was great and explained everything. Make sure to ask for left handed clubs if you're a lefty! We tried a few mixed drinks and got a beer tower.  We also ordered some fries. Our server surprised us with some free donut holes for my birthday.    There is also free shuffle board inside and a bar.  I wish we got to see the pool area but it was closed for a private event.",

Located next to the MGM, this expansive campus is a great place to come hang out with a group for a couple hours. Offering a wide variety of activities besides the  driving range such as six way beer pong, ping pong, sack toss, basketball hoop game and the pool on the 3rd floor.   They charged us a flat $75 per hour to rent one of the bays (prices vary weekday and weekends) where you can order great cocktails and eat from a wide menu. The price point is reasonable for Vegas standards.   I highly recommend this place if you want to spend a couple hours of fun in one spot and not go shopping.",

    "text": "Yo! You MUST believe the hype. Top Golf is dope! I would highly recommend this experience to anyone and everyone, especially for groups of at least six. The best way to describe this place is a driving range - Vegas style! Neon lights, club music, drinks, the glitz, the glam, but all very masculine too!  Our party of 7 arrived at 11pm with an assumption it was going to be expensive, so our plan was to just tour the place in order to be able to say \"yeah, we've been there.\" To our delight, the price of $60 per hour was not that bad after-all (initially we thought it was $60 per person!). $60 divided by 7 of us on Level 2 - take our money now!  After checking in at the desk, our party was escorted to the bay by a staff member who ended up giving us an overview of the games available and terms to which we all agreed upon (like the net is not a hammock, but there for safety). He was thorough, funny, patient, and just all around awesome! We were ready to get our 1-hour game on.   The line-up is limited to 6 players with a complete entry of your first & last name and email, so our 7th member just shared a few rounds from each of us (unfortunately his name could not be inputted). In total, each participant gets 20 rounds. Therefore, it was recommended each person took turns after hitting 5 balls to get through all 20 in an hour.  For all of you expert mini-golfers, this experience will make you consider moving your golfing skills to the range. Boy, did I feel like a bad ash! Hehe. After a few warm-ups with the driver, an improvement in my form, and a beer, I was able to connect and hit the sweet spot more than several times. What a natural high. So much fun!  After an hour of golf, we proceeded to give the rest of the place a tour. Levels 3 & 4 had an awesome view of the range, a 2-level swimming pool with a swim-up bar, super XL movie screen, plenty of hip lounge areas, and more fun activities like corn hole and a shuffleboard table.  If you're local, just show your resident ID for a 20% discount; or if you're military it's a 10% discount on the Top Golf fee. Sweet! Our party was able to take advantage of both discounts.  Whatever happens in Vegas, stays in Vegas?! Nah. This spot is too much fun to keep a secret. Tell all your friends and book your reservation now. You won't regret it!",

    "text": "So glad they brought Topgolf to Vegas. My husband went to the one in Houston when he went for a bachelor party and they said they had a lot of fun. I am so glad we got to try it this past weekend in Vegas.   We went in a group of ten. Walked in and didn't make any reservations prior, but we only had to wait half an hour to get a Bay on the first level. The levels increase in price the higher you go and there are four floors. As we were waiting, they have a full bar inside and places to sit. There's also cornhole if you're bored and want to play.   They get you set up with six players but we rotated between the six of us. The first part where they set us up with six cards that were membership cards was kind of tedious, we just wanted to get in and play. Someone explained the games to us and showed us how everything works. It's neat that the screen, balls, and everything are all computerized and it'll show you how far you hit the ball or which color zone it landed in.   We started playing and you pay by the hour. There's some comfy couches to sit when you aren't hitting. You also get a waitress who will take food and drink orders. We ordered the five layer dip, chicken wings, and popcorn shrimp, all were good. We also kept the drinks coming.   Love the cool misting fans!!! It was nice to hang out in the shade and in the coolness since we knew it was hot outside (summertime), such a better way to spend an afternoon rather than at a day club.   We went to go take a look at the pool on the third floor too. It's much hotter up there, less shade and in direct sunlight. The pool is small, there were a few people in there. Some cool pool inflatables like a donut and pizza. There's also a DJ up on the third floor playing music. In my opinion, it was too hot up there, glad we were on the first floor. I think second level might be best. Since the view is cooler and it's also in the shade.   Would definitely come back in the future! Highly recommend!",

We have the best time every time we come whether it's with friends from out of town to watch the sunset and grab a drink, to golf, or on industry nights. We were here last night for another industry night and had a great time.   It's the perfect place. Sit in a cozy, comfy bay, hit balls, eat delicious food, hang with friends, listen to music and relax. There's heaters in each bay so we were warm, toasty and happy. Had great service all night. The place seems really organized and well run. It's like being at a restaurant with a really great patio and you can play the whole time!   And the food is good too. We tried some different items last night- ordered the crispy rock shrimp which were Amazing. That sauce omg. Also had wings which had a really good flavor. Also ordered the Mushi- only Bc I saw it on another table and immediately had heart eyes. But it was a waste. It's basically a burrrito (filled with mostly rice) cut into 6ths and plated well. None of us liked it and felt like it was worthless. Tasted like a bland burrito/ no sauce from El Pollo Loco. Luckily I dipped it in the sauce from the wings and the shrimp and it was better. But still a waste. Anyway I won't let this stupid burrito affect my love for Top Golf.   We will be back soon! ESP Bc my husband won the raffle for two free hours of play. See you soon Top Golf.",

At the entrance there's a huge movie theatre style board with the prices listed. You rent a Bay and it's sectioned off with VIP club style cushion seating so it feels semi private. It comes complete with a set of golf clubs clearly marked for drivers, irons and wedges.  As you swing and wack your golf ball trying to make it into one of marked holes you can watch a game. At the far end is a huge screen. You can order food and the novelty drink holder is a golf bag with the golf club as your straw. Awesomeness! At the entrance there is a gift shop to the right. Then a huge area to sit in and watch more gigantic TV screens. There's shuffle board and a bunch of corn hole sets. A bar is located farther in the building but there are several bars. Even a section for live music, you can take lessons. Women you can take lessons in a relaxed environment specifically catered to women. Luv this. You can even get professionally fitted for clubs here.   This is a great alternative to have Vegas fun if your aren't into the club scene. Awesome place to be day or evening. The crowd here is friendly and everyone is just enjoying themselves. Very casual. It's multi level so you can go to floors above the main floor. Ellen Degeneres even came to hit a few and had a great time at TopGolf. Out of all the driving ranges I've been to. This definitely is my Top Golf choice and another favorite thing to do in Vegas.

Definitely a snobby vibe from the staff and no desire to go above and beyond to make your experience memorable. One of my guests lost a jacket and the manager wouldn't even communicate with us, he sent a bodyguard to do the talking? Pretty baffling...but maybe snobbiness is a norm in Vegas? Either way...this place rocks, but buyer beware: great customer service not included in the price!",

    "text": "I came here for a company event & it's pretty cool. It's not your typical driving range. They serve food, drinks, and each section is like a lounge. It's basically like a socializing lounge with the option to golf.   The food is really good too. My company had the BBQ platter & ended with the donuts... and omg, they were <a href=\"/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2Fbomb.com&s=bb4f996415a9c2f21137e27cfb68f439a48cec2652b53e9b50dd7e766dbe177e\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">bomb.com</a>!  The price is definitely pricey compared to regular driving ranges, but if you split the cost, it's reasonable (food & beverage are additional cost).  There are 3 different levels: 1st level, lounges for each group is a bit small. 2nd floor lounges are more spacious, and 3rd floor lounges are more VIP looking. You can even rent a private lounge that's all pimped out & even has mini-kitchen/wet bar.  During summer they have a pool area that looks pretty cool as well... makes me wonder how crazy packed the pool gets tho!  Overall, it's a cool place which definitely presents the Vegas lifestyle.",

    "text": "I'm a fan of Topgolf, and this was one of the better spaces I'd seen at a Topgolf in a while. I'm very much on the casual side of the golfing spectrum, but it's always a good time to drink some beers and hit golf balls far away. This served as our day activity during a bachelor party weekend, along with watching the evening college football games on the many TVs they had around. They had a lot of the games on, and it was just a marvel to be able to watch so many games during the downtime of not blasting golf balls into the colored targets.   I would say that the important difference between Topgolf and a regular driving range is that Topgolf stresses precision and accuracy more than sheer distance, which is pretty cool. The technology behind the Topgolf system is pretty impressive, and even if you don't particularly enjoy golf, there's a lot of stuff for you to do. Make sure to get a reservation in advance for weekends. Also, know that it is a bit on the expensive side, and with food and drink, the tab can really add up.  I think the only thing that was sub-par was the service, and it was definitely sub-par. We were constantly asking for drinks, and they got our food orders wrong 3 or 4 times, sending us things we didn't order, and forgetting things we did order. It also just didn't seem like they were trying very hard, and we didn't seem to have a dedicated server, so there was just a lot of confusion. The food was decent, although just a little higher quality than a typical gastropub.   The facility is top-notch and modern, and it's just a really cool place to hang out and hit some golf balls, but the service has to improve. I'd recommend it if you haven't been before, or if you reaaallly like golf, but for the super casual golfer, it might be worth it to explore other options.",

Also, they treated my brother in law fresh donuts for his birthday and it was delish! We also got drinks (the most expensive part of this entire place but it wasn't a buzzkill when having this kind of fun) and nachos... yum!! Lots of fun.

It is fun at night when the music feels like a nightclub and the holes flash to the music.    Open to all ages.    Stand behind the red line, before someone's golf club knocks you out.   The golfing space should probably be wider.  They've got golf clubs for lefties, upon request.",

Pros: TG golf is a playground for avid golfers, but a fun hangout for those who are not. It offers large and heated suites for putting, with games and equipment provided. If not interested in golfing it offers spacious and multiple seating areas with big screens showing worldwide sports. There is also a menu with drinks, apps, and dinner options.   Cons: while daytime slots are easy to come by, the wait for evening can be quite long. Additionally, do not expect this to be a serious range. The clubs are weak and the balls have chips. In them, which impact how they fly. Also, expect to pay a membership fee to play in addition to range fees.",

When we initially arrived on a Saturday night at around 9:30pm, we expected it to be super busy with a long wait, but we were wrong. We only waited 15 minutes for our Level 3 bay. The whole experience was top-notch! It felt like being at a lounge/club-like atmosphere along with a high-tech driving range where the balls are tracked via RFID so it can precisely score where you hit the color target areas. Our hostess and other employees were very friendly and attentive. The drinks were alright and the best food item we ordered were the \"adult\" donut holes. I highly recommend that dessert especially going in the evening after having dinner. I will definitely be back to Top Golf next time I'm in Las Vegas!",

The first time we came on a Saturday night and were told the wait would be two hours. OK. We decided to stay and wait at the bar. Drinks were TERRIBLE, way too sweet and poorly mixed for the price. After 2.5 hours I went to check on the time status. We were told it would still be at least an hour wait. We left... Not worth the wait.  The second time, we planned ahead, we checked in a top golf early (told 3 hour wait) then went and had dinner and drinks to kill time. Showed up at top golf after waiting 3.5 hours, and were told it would still be an hour wait!! I've spent HOURS trying to swing a club here and never actually got a bay.

First- you don't have to like golf to love this venue. It's absolutely beautiful, multiple bars, pools, tons of seating and places to lounge. You can spend an evening there just people watching and enjoying the views.   I parked myself at the bar on the fourth level and enjoyed the breeze and surroundings.   Drink and food prices are consistent with any other gastropub, and considering you are practically mid strip- not bad at all.   No, there's no parking. Either Uber/Lyft it or valet, it's not that serious.   Now as far as being family friendly- I won't be bringing kids by anytime soon, even though there are spots kids are allowed. The crowd is largely mid 20-early 30 and atmosphere is pretty testosterone charged, and abundance of silicone enhanced view is not all that PG 13.   If you are a large party with a few kids sprinkled in, you'll be fine, however.   I definitely recommend this spot as a cool new hangout, golfer or not.",

The rest of the group took the shuttle from the main entrance of the hotel around 11:30 am.  We got a \"bay\" on the 2nd deck without any wait.  We were told that it gets busy, particularly in the evenings and waits can run a couple of hours.  It may pay to call ahead.  I have nothing but good things to say.  The games are fun.  Technically, they can only accommodate 6 players, but a couple of folks in our party split turns.  Don't let the 6 player limit stop you from trying this.  The technology features balls with an inserted chip, so the ball knows who hit it, and where it landed.  You get points for accuracy, but given the layout of the targets, it is hard even for beginners to miss every target.  We had a total beginner in our group, and he still had fun.  They have several bars and pub food.  There are open lounge areas with big screen TVs.  They even had TVs at the end of the driving range.  Everyone in our group thought that the food was good.  The servers are very attentive.  It is clear that customer service is a priority.  This place would be an absolute blast for a night out with a group.  They even have a pool with cabanas if you are not the golfing type.  Like anything in Vegas, Top Golf comes at a price.  We paid $60 an hour for the \"bay\".  Prime time is a bit more, early morning a bit less.  Food is not included.  Our group of 7 was able to get through two games in two hours.    Overall, Top Golf is a fun time for a group, no matter their golfing experience.  I'll go again the next time I'm in Vegas.  Top Golf rates five stars from me.",

The only reason I gave 3 stars is because the bartenders barely ever smile and I always feel super uncomfortable. I tip well, order drinks and came to relax and mingle. They are look so angry other then that you'll love it here, if you can get pass the bartenders frowning.",

    "text": "My fiance and I are locals and I work on the strip as many locals do. My mom who is 60 came in town to visit so we thought Top golf would be fun for all of us.  We went on a Tuesday around 4pm and stayed for one hour. We were greeted quickly and shown to our bay within about 3minutes. From there we had a host explain the system and all the cool features our bay had. It was a bit chilly outside but there were heaters which made it comfortable. We ordered waters until we could decide what we wanted to munch on they have a great selection of treats. We each took our turns and had a great time playing but I will say we are golf challenged lol I ordered tater tots and some hot tea which arrived promptly. When our time was up the waitress asked if we would like to extend our time and we opted out due to other plans we had made.  A few hours passed and I realized I forgot my purse which I thought just had my ID and a few other things. We are home when I start rubbing my hands together and find that my engagement ring isnt on my finger. I remembered that after my first few swings i took off my rings and put them in my purse because they were pinching my skin when i would swing the club. When I remembered that happened I called Top golf immediately and spoke to a few different individuals all of them said that nothing was turned in to lost and found. When we went inside to speak with guest services they directed me to a manager and then we went to look at the bay we were at and nothing. Then she introduced me to the head of security Zach and he explained that he would check surveillance and get back to us. I felt hopeless because in all honesty theres not a lot of time to go looking through surveillance for some ladies purse. We waited in the parking lot and Zach got back to us within 15-20minutes.  I appreciate the staff not only for there customer service the first time we went in to play but also  when i retuned full of anxiety and nerves they were all so helpful and did everything they could to help me retrieve my belongings and especially my new engagement ring. There are not a lot of businesses on the strip in Vegas that would take the time to do what they did.",

    "text": "First off this place is an amazing facility, and the concept of a computerized driving range with private table service food and beverage and a pool on site could be so awesome. In theory. Our golf computer went down twice (see the photo), resetting our scores both times to zero. They charge you $5 per player just to save your scores with your name?! We were without a playable computer for about 30 minutes total. Most of all though, the service was a TRAIN WRECK. We hardly ever saw our server, who was gone for 45 minutes at one point. We had items on our bill we didn't order, and the compensation for the computer problems never arrived. The manager then nickle and dimed us for 15 minute time charges for out problems, and it took nearly 45 minutes to settle the bill. I left extremely disappointed for something that could have been so awesome.",

    "text": "In a word \"excessive\".   On a Thursday night and excited to come for the first time i was a bit overwhelmed when we pulled up. Valet was super backed up but not a bit deal, as i can be patient at times. Walked up to the counter and was told that it was an hour to hour and 15 minute wait. Got on the list and began to walk around the facility to check it all out and take in the view. Sure the facility is well setup with bars, tvs, and a few games, and what i enjoyed was plenty of seating on all floors. What i didnt like during my tour around was the fact that it was obvious that the place wasnt packed enough to justify a wait of an hour, or really a wait at all. I honestly feel as if it was a tactic to force you to order food & drinks and get a tab started. Once we finally got a spot to hit from the 1st floor, the machines were a bit slow on reading the balls, but it wasnt horrible. The games are entertaining and its nice that they provided clubs even though they were not the greatest (better than nothing). We played for an hour and change, had a pitcher of beer and a few drinks between the 3 of us and the tab came out to $210. Im sorry but i felt that was a bit ridiculous. I will not be going back for the sheer cost of the experience here. You cannot use the same excuse everyone does when things are over prices \"but its Vegas\"... who cares, as hitting balls at a traditional range is pennies compared to this madness. Its the new thing to do in Vegas, but i came, i hit, and im running....",

We had a group of 5 and we were told a 45 minute to an hour wait, totally fine. The girl at the front desk Janelle, was nothing short of extremely rude and unprofessional. It had been a little over an hour and my buddy asked her how much longer it would be and she said there was a handful of guest ahead of us  still, that it shouldn't be over 30 minutes, an hour later, we were still there waiting with no sort of update. When we approached her one last time, she didn't seem to care at all that we had been waiting well over the advised time. So sad that the great atmosphere created gets COMPLETELY overshadowed by the poor service.",

Go at night (although its a high rate per hour to play in the evening peak hours) I think its worth it with the view. People of all levels and people who have never played golf before can play. If they are super anti golf they can find fun at the pool, or other games that top golf has.   Attire is kinda weird at top golf - depending on the time that you go some people get really dressy in the evening and some people look like they are going to a night club others are super casual. But there is no dress code that I am aware of so just wear what you want.  Also the food and drinks are pretty darn good! They have a drink that comes in a golf bag shaped drink glass that lights up. ITS REALLY COOL and all your friends will be jealous !!  Pro tip-  You can bring your own clubs if you don't want to use the callaway clubs that they have and if you have time, remember to bring your golf glove !",

The place is clean, free parking (at least in the daytime), food is great and beautiful, comfortable decor. You can have a business meeting or a birthday party here. You don't even have to play golf - You can come for cocktails! I took my first swing of golf here and now I have a whole new respect for the sport. It's definitely tough but it's fun to learn here.

The food and drinks were amazing too. If you're going just for that, it's worth it. I had a margarita, burger, and tots. All were great. My boyfriend had the wings and was pretty impressed as well, far better than hooters offers down the street.   Ladies - if you're tall and new to golfing, consider the men's clubs. The staff kept trying to get me to use the female clubs, but at 5'10 I'm just too tall for them AND I have years of golf experience, the heavier weight of the men's club was better.",

Make sure you sign up for a membership while you're there. It'll give you 20% off your visits. Attire is pretty much whatever you like.

    "text": "I have always wanted to go to the golf course and hit some rounds. My friends and I decided to check out Top Golf while in Vegas and boy was it an adventure. As a newbie to golf I definitely struggled with picking the right club and hitting the ball but it was fun and cheap. We went before noon so it was $30/hr for the bay. Each player gets 20 balls. We took turns but you could hit them all at once if you prefer. You pick your club and wave it over the sensor and a ball is kicked out to you. Then the swinging begins. If you are like me then you will spend lots of time swinging and missing the ball. You aim at the various targets and the closer inward the higher the points. The balls contain sensors and the points are automatically computed. You are given the option to extend your time during your remaining 15 mins. We declined but only because we had other places we wanted to check out. We all agreed that we would definitely do it again and that we had fun.   Seating area: The bays are separated with short sectionals and a table. You can order food and drinks and they are brought to you. Each bay has a separate tv, separate clubs for both men and women, and score tracker.   There are also seats at the bar.   1st and 2nd level are for adults and kids. Levels 3 and 4 are adult only 21+ and includes a pool. Levels 1 & 2: $30 before noon, $45 after noon, and $60 for the evening time slots. Levels 3 & 4: $45 before noon, $60 after noon, and I cannot recall the evening price.   New players must get a membership for $5 but it last for a lifetime. We chose the top shot game since we are rookies. We didn't get any alcoholic drinks although they offered a nice selection. Instead we opted for fountain drinks. Drinks before noon make me sluggish and kills my productive.   We encountered a minor issue when my friend could not locate her coin purse. Luckily she had left it in the car. The staff deserves MAJOR KUDOS. The staff that provides the drinks searched for us very thoroughly. The guy in charge of security assisted as well as the manager. I think his name was Das. Everyone went into search mode. Our bay neighbors also assisted with searching. It was great news to find out that it was not missing just misplaced but in a safe place. So the good news is if an issue does arise here they will definitely go above and beyond to take care of you and help anyway they can.",

Food and bottle service/drink prices are actually very reasonable by Vegas standards and our servers (Jasmin and another gal) were awesome to work with.    Definitely a great place to go to for a huge crowd and I highly recommend the 3rd floor cabana/driving range, as it had a great crowd and a lively mix of people, mostly under 40 (which did surprise me a bit...maybe we came there at a good day?).

There was plenty to do while waiting for our bay and although service was slow while we were waiting it was really good once we got into our bay. Overall a really good family friendly experience.",

    "text": "First off, when i called to make a reservation... the customer service was HORRIBLE! The first \"sales\" lady I talked to was rude and very dismissive. I wanted to make a reservation for my husbands birthday. Apparently if you make a reservation they charge you premium rates and force you to spend a certain amount on food and drinks. When i asked why if you dont make a reservation its $69/hour (for locals) but if you make a reservation it was $100 per hour (minimum 2 hours) and you HAVE to spend at least $320 on food and drinks. She couldnt explain except that you were making a reservation. I told her i would have to think about it and i would call back.   I decided that i was going to go call back and go through with it. So i call back and the First Lady put on my notes that i was no longer interested. Ok, that was not in our conversation. But thanks lady!   They girl said that she would transfer the to the same lady, and then a man answered. Clay. Clay was ok in customer service and did a better job of explaining things. So if you make a reservation you are taking the golf bay \"offline\" and they make you buy a certain amount towards food and drinks. Still seems completely absurd to me. But ok, apparently it works for them. He said that he would send me a document that i would have to sign and a deposit of $250 would be required.   I got the email and it was a bill for $600. Are you kidding me? $600 for 2 hours? And there was some \"service fee\" in there as well. What a joke!  So i decided that we would just wait! It was an hour and a half wait. We sat at the bar to grab a few drink while we waited. The female bartender was cold and rude. But i guess she doesn't have time to bother with girls! Obviously her time has to be occupied by flirting with male customers. Our drinks sat empty for a solid 15 minutes. Thankfully a male bartender jumped behind the bar! Apparently he believe in equal rights for drinks haha  It was finally our time to play some golf. The lady that came over was nice enough and explained the rules. Our waitress was ok. Not very attentive, and took a double Jameson ginger that was half full, so that was super cool. But at least she was friendly.   The one star is that the actual golfing part was fun. The machine didn't track a couple of your balls, but overall that part was enjoyable!  Not even 5 minutes after my paid 2 hours was up were were being \"shooed\" (not literally) to leave. A bouncer looking guy said we needed to wrap it up, came off a little pushy and rude. I guess when your time is up you're not allowed to finish your drinks, you just need to get the f out so they can have a higher turnover. I guess that works in Vegas because most their clientele are tourists.   I do not think that we will not be returning to this establishment. And I DEFINITELY do not recommend making reservations as they take advantage. The only thing i would recommend would be to go there expecting at least an hour wait, and sit at the bar and have a couple drinks while you wait.",

    "text": "So recommended when in Vegas! It's like going bowling with your friends, but, of course, it's golfing instead. Golf clubs already available. Different games you can play. Like shooting to the hole color that the game chooses or getting high score by how close you hit the ball into the center of one of the holes and how far you hit. Live band playing at night. Bar available but you can order drinks and food from a server who comes to your table. About a 2 1/2 wait when we got there at 5:30 PM. We walked to the MGM through the parking lot/conference/pool area and ate dinner before heading back to play. You can eat at Top Golf but we chose to eat at casino. Text message sent to your phone when your bay is ready. Definitely a fun experience. AND I don't play golf. If you want to save a little money, play before 5 pm. After 5 pm, prices jump a couple tens. Also save money by choosing floor 1 or 2 versus floor 3. We got floor 2 in the center. We got lucky!   Customer service- server was great! Came around a lot! Check in desk was ok. Not too many smiling workers willing to greet you. Worker who greets you at your bay was definitely impatient with us. Felt like she wanted to get out. It may be that the service was slightly lacking because most of the workers were really young. 4 star is for the lack of quality customer service.",

I would like to share my feedback through this channel to let whomever reads these know how much of a horrible experience my friends and I endured here on 12/26/18 @ approximately 8:45 PM we were finishing up a game of golf when our server Jennifer C. brought out the tab. There were 3 of us so we needed time to divide the bill out according to what each person ordered. We let Jennifer know that we needed a moment and within maybe 5 minutes (if that) she returned 3 times hovering over us and rushing us to pay. In so many words that we needed to hurry up. My best friend wasn't feeling well and went to the bathroom and we let Jennifer know this but she didn't care. Once my friend returned we were told that we needed to exit the bay immediately and sit at one of the table tops and finish our payment there.   This was done in an extremely rude way and we began to feel as if we weren't welcomed after spending 355.44 dollars in total. Jennifer's condescending attitude and tone towards us was absolutely unnecessary for which resulted in less of a tip. Not sure how in the hell you can expect to be tipped well when you treat people like they are just a number and like a piece of shit. Prior to golfing we started in the bar area and had a pleasant time and tipped the young lady well in that area. One of the signed copies for the split bill was taken by accident after leaving. Jennifer called the security to have them stop us while being transported in the free shuttle to MGM basically saying in so many words that we ran out on the bill. This was heard by everyone in the shuttle as the driver had the walkie talkie volume up pretty loud. We turned around and headed back to the front of the building. Jennifer came flying down the stairs approaching the van in an aggressive manner. She then proceeds to say that she needed this bill signed and told us verbatim that she lost out on money because of our table. Told everybody in the shuttle that we didn't tip on a $400 dollar bill which was completely False as we tipped the prior person in the bar before the transferring of the tab. Very unprofessional behavior to cause such a scene in front of the other passengers in the shuttle and embarrassing us as if we were criminals even though every persons card was approved and we paid. A simple mistake of taking the signed copy turned into a whole showdown argument between Jennifer and our group.   We believe whole heartedly that we were being racially profiled from the beginning. The series of events and her sickening attitude towards us clearly can justify this claim. I am beyond embarrassed still till this day about this as my best friend drove out from Los Angeles and this was her first experience. We did receive a manager card which I no longer have however I wanted to make this into a formal complaint to go on record. I really hope that this type of behavior from Jennifer C is acceptable. I can't imagine such a situation being handled like this aligning with Top Golf's vision/values for the public.",

The waitress recommended we get 2 of everything we wanted because of the size of our group. We had 9 people.  When we were done, we could have fed at least another 20 people with the left overs. I guess she was trying to make more tip but comon. We trusted her and she made us order food for 30 people.  Our bill was over 1k for 9 people. We were all too embarrassed to complain to the manager so we let it go. Do not trust them when they recommend an amount of food to you. Just order a little and you can always order more.  The food was bar food. It came out cold and got colder within 10 minutes. We all felt ripped off and that's not how you want to experience something for the first time.    It would have been better if she brought out the first round of food and then if we finished it, asked if we wanted more.  But even one of each would have been too much for us. Wasted food wasted money.   I sure hope she enjoyed her extra tip.  I had a long conversation with the management.  They were fair and refunded us for the extra food they oversold us.  Thank you",

    "text": "This place was awesome. It gives another spin into the golf game. Wether you can golf or not, it's a fun time for the whole group.   If you're coming from the MGM lobby, they have a shuttle for you to take you all the way there next to the Wet Republic Pool Party. That way you don't have to walk! There's also a parking lot for anyone else who drives.   Make reservations! If you didn't, like myself we had to wait about 20-30min for the lower floor. If you want the upper floors, it will be greater than 1 hour wait. We came on a summer weekend so just know it's more packed. Sign up for a membership beforehand if you're new.   It's actually not bad waiting because they have seating area, bar, food, TV, and games. So you can still enjoy yourself before playing.   Now, when you get to your location, the attendant will explain everything to you if you don't know what to do. Afterwards just start golfing and try to make as many points and score depending on what type of game you play. If your time is running out you have the option to add more time. Know that if your last game ends in the middle, it won't record your score onto your account.   It's cool you can track your play and score on your account over time. Top golf has innovated itself where anyone can enjoy golf.",

Highly recommended place to go if you want to hang out with a group of 4-8 people.    I think you can pay up and play from the higher levels (different floors).  Would love to comeback in the future!",

From the moment you step in it's very inviting even for those who aren't up to embarrassing themselves on the tees. Comfy seating whether it's just you or a group there is plenty of room to get comfortable. Great service from the wait staff so drinks and food are quick to come to your table. Huge screens to keep track of all the games you bet on AND heaters at every seating bay and golf bay so even in the dead of the Las Vegas winters you still stay warm enough where a jacket is optional.   Prices are great because you don't pay per person if you golf so you can divide it up across your group making it very affordable depending on how much time you want to golf for. Waiters and waitresses are also always waiting on you as you golf so there's never any need to waste time trying to find someone for a refill or a plate of wings. I completely recommend going here after a long night out or even before a long night. All ages are welcome.   Awesome, awesome place and I will definitely go back!",

    "text": "Fore!   My husband and I were invited for a company event.  Many of the employees gathered for some golfing fun along with some shared food.  The facility is very large but incredibly clean.  It is set up like a driving range with points to score.  It's definitely family friendly and fun for all ages.    In addition to golfing, they offer a wide variety of menu items for groups or just one.  I had nice options of pulled pork, burger sliders, veggie trays, chips with guacamole and flatbreads.  The best of all were the injectable donut holes with jelly, chocolate or vanilla filing.  Certainly delicious.    The only downfall is when the temperature is warmer, the mister system automatically comes on in all golf bays.  So if you have food and drinks sitting on the table, it all gets the lovely mist on everything.  The waitress said there is no way to shut them off.  I would hope they could remedy this situation.    All in all it is a fun place that hosts locals and visitors.  Even for me, who is a non golfer, I would recommend trying it out!",

That is absolutely ridiculous.  The fun Top Golf experience is not worth that kind of money of you ask me. We decided to forgo the golf and instead just have a drink and bite at the bar. The beers are not cheap. $8 for a draft beer is a bit high. This is theme park prices. We decided to split the steak skewers with shishito peppers. The steak was well seasoned and sitting in a vinaigrette dressing. Super tender and just the right kick with the peppers. I really like this appetizer. We enjoyed the nice weather and beautiful view, but not sure how often I would come to this location for the high prices.",

If you are reserving a bay as a private party, just know they add an extra service charge (our was @ $70 on top of tax & gratuity) plus they require a deposit. If there is a required deposit, why the extra service charge?  Food was surprisingly....excellent. I think we were all shocked at how great the food was. We got the bbq platter, taco platter, pizookie and donut holes. Everything tasted great with generous portions.   Had to dock a star for that dumb reservation charge, but will definitely come back as a walk-in with a smaller group.",

We still had a ton of fun here as it is a really fun spot to go to with the family. Just be prepared to wait for a long time here because they dont have any reservations allowed at this location like others do. So its a bit of chaos with the lines and it was a bit dirty, tables were not really wiped down. We waited 30 mins plus and thankfully there is an area where we can chill to watch the big screen and some mini games to keep the blood flowing. When we finally got our lane, there was like 4-5 visible open lanes to our suprise given how long we waited.   Food: we ordered some snacks and stay away from ordering fries. Typically fries is my go to inexpensive snack for the family but here....they charge you $6 for a smallll handful of gormet style fries. Big rip. Opt for the layer dip or the salt n vinager chips. Learn from our mistake.  Drinks: glad they had delicious bloody marys. That kept the grown ups happy.  Overall, we had fun and this topgolf has the flare and lines that matches vegas.",

Top Golf is a multi level golf putting arena with stocked up bars, a pool, and a lounge area with big screen tvs for the sports fan.   This is my first time here and I am not a golfer but it is a fun atmosphere to hang out with my friends. The menu offers a variety of foods from Grilled New York Strip,  wings, flatbreads, Burgers and sliders and Cabana packages.   This is a kid friendly place, it's a fun for the whole family hall around.   Top Golf is totally entertaining! I am very impressed.",

We really wanted 3rd floor, but we had a minor with us so we settled for 2nd. The facility is technology friendly.   After choosing a club (female and male differ), you wave it over the sensor and a ball pops out. Across the course you have colored hole markers, marking score as you make it into them. I couldn't believe the advanced tech. TV screens informed you of where exactly the ball went into. Trust me, keeping track of that tiny thing is hard. No, the ball cars have no points if you hit the poor suckers.   Ok....fyi. I SUCKED. Not just kinda sucked, but was insanely horrible. I scored like 10 while everyone got over 20. My only comment on this place would be to wish they had someone show you how to swing a club in order for me to actually hit the ball rather than spending half my time swining air. It was nice to see others sucking just as bad, so I didnt feel too terrible.   I'm definitely coming back! Local discount for Nevada residents! Check online before coming.",

Some were really good.   Service. Someone was always around, excellent. Golf instruction. Very good instruction but weird to have this during a charity event. No one was willing to hit and risk looking bad. Most women were in high heels, and couldn't hit golf balls. Most guys hit a ball and then got a drink.  Facilities. Not just toilets, the place is new and hip with televisions all around.   Bad: Cookies. Dry. Not worth the calories. So disappointed because I'm a cookie guy. Brownies. Also dry. Not worth the calories. Doubly disappointed because brownies are a close 2nd to choc chip cookies.  Drinks. Some were really bad.  Chicken skewers. Dry. Fried foie gras. You ruined foie gras?

They were so good and so very nice of them. We weren't expecting anything at all. The games were fun and even if you suck at golf, like me, you will still have a good time. It is fairly pricy but you can have 8 people per bay. Also if you're a local like us you get 20% off which is awesome. I will definitely be back on special occasions but I will see other driving ranges for the frequent trips.",

We stayed for an hour and a half, and ordered the Kalbi tacos (soooo delicious) and a few beers. The place is clean and feels brand new, the staff are very helpful and friendly, and the experience is totally awesome. I'd recommend coming during their \"off\" times (cheaper by $15-60 depending on what floor you get). There was a very minimal wait for the first floor so we opted for that. The next time we come here (we will definitely be back) I would love to try it at night and on a higher level, but the difference in price at peak times really made it worth our while to opt for the cheaper level to get more time on the range. We were told they're opening a Topgolf in LA too! Can't wait to visit that one too!",

Decent food and drinks. Expensive. $600 for six people for two hours with about two drinks each and a platter of tacos. I won't say outrageous, especially for Las Vegas, but you should be prepared. My major complaint is with the arrival experience. We are locals and when we pulled up to the driveway we discovered there was no onsite parking or valet as we've experienced in the past. Apparently they had put a convention tent on the parking lot, and so they were sending all cars to the MGM. We ended up valeting at MGM at a cost of about $20 plus tips. Yes, we could have self-parked but everyone knows MGM self-park is among the worst in Las Vegas.  Either way, it stole about twenty minutes of our two hour window just to get the car parked and then to make our way back to Topgolf. With all of the real estate MGM has, I don't know why they needed to occupy the top golf parking lot with a pop-up tent. They should expect this to cost them locals business if this becomes the norm.",

Parking is free, and if you are a local, you get 20% off your time (so about $60 for peak times in the evening on the 2nd bay).  If you come in the evening, it can get quite busy.  Both times I've had between 1.5-2 hour waits, but you can leave your name and they will call / text you when it's your turn.  Note if it's your first time to Top Golf, they charge you a $5 membership fee to be in their system.  Each bay allows up to 6 players and 10 people.",

    "text": "I went to TopGolf for the exclusive pre-opening VIP event and I was NOT disappointed. My review may be biased because I didn't spend a fortune playing, but the employees, the atmosphere, and the customer service was top notch. There are pools on 2 separate floors at TopGolf and there are lounging areas as well. It's a lot like bowling, where you can put in the members who are golfing, it keeps track of points, and whose turn it is next, etc. There were a few occasions where we had to ask for assistance because we had technical difficulties with the system not working. That put a cramp into things, but I'm sure they were still working out some kinks at the time of the event.  I was told that you could reserve a bank starting at $40/hr, but that's all the information she gave us. I wasn't able to discern if that was a weekday/lunch hour special price or if that is inclusive of the weekends. From the other reviews I am reading, it sounds like it is a lot more than $40/hr. I would call to confirm before you head down if you are on a budget to avoid any surprises.  Overall, this place is fun, exciting, and the service from the team as great as well.",

I think this is a fun place to go with out-of-towners or your local friends for something different. Drinks and food are pricey, but worth it. The bay rental is reasonable since you can have up to 6 people...if only I had that many friends...  I've been several times now, first time was a Yelp/Media preview night which was lots of fun. I then got my team at work to do our quarterly outing there and then took my folks when they were in town. Each time has been different but awesome.   I suggest renting a bay higher up, yes it costs more, but at night the view is awesome. I have yet to check out the pools, cause to me it just feels odd to swim there...maybe next summer.  Big selection of beers and cocktails, the food was catered each time so I can't comment on ordering food. Check it out, bring some fun people and enjoy a driving range right next to the LV Strip.",

We had a family group and found ourselves with an hour wait as they don't reserve here.  We left and went to eat...paged while eating but they gave us another 60 minutes.  This was good.  Returned and waited a little but was able to get a \"booth\" and lessons on playing.  Unfortunately it took about 15 minutes to instruct us and set up two memberships.  Playing w 6 poeple is a chore and we didn't have enough time to finish the game so we added 30 minutes.  All worked out at the end as we each were able to hit another 10 balls before out time expired. The check out interesting as they charged us for 4 memberships which we already paid for before coming.  Front desk confirmed same prior to us playing.  We also mentioned resident which wasn't on the bill.  The server was good and apologized and had the charges adjusted.  I had 5 receipts as the booth was one, beer another, gift card another, total itemized and then the final bill.  I asked again to be sure which after checking my cc appears to be correct.   Overall it was a nice time with great views...advice would be to make sure your invoices are correct and you sign in for membership days prior (which always isn't possible for visitors).  Since you can't reserve a regular 6 person booth, you should allow hours with wait and play.",

The moment the food arrived we got a text saying we could check in so we picked the option to delay checkin by 15 minutes.  Apparently 15 minutes is not Really 15 minutes.

We got there at 10:30 AM on a Saturday - no problem getting a bay. By the time we left at 1 PM, the place was packed, even on the 2nd level with some people waiting. Nice quality clubs in each bay, including lefty clubs and kids clubs. If you are successful at hitting the targets, you score points. So if there are some competitive sorts in your party, friendly betting is an option. There is also table-top shuffle board - more competition and more friendly betting. There is a large lounge area with big screen TVs (several college football games on while we were there). We planned to come for just one hour and ended up staying two and a half. Everyone had a blast. When we were there, it was $45 and hour for each bay. With 6 sharing the bay, the price per head is very reasonable (they do charge $5 per head to \"join\", which I felt was kind of tacky). The food service was pretty reasonably priced as well (and fairly tasty). We are planning on returning with 2 or 3 couples as an evening out. A very unique fun outing.",

Another guests sea bass sliders were again stone cold. I won't blame the waitress, I blame the kitchen staff. Somebody needs to be raked over the coals for this. We are walking away without golfing or drinking anymore. 6 guests all disappointed.  UPDATE  Ok so the manager came to our table and apologized and explained why our food was cold. They comp'd us some food so we decided to stay for golf. We were greeted and brought to our bay. We were told if we wanted to use a 7 iron we had to reach across to use the one on the next bay. We did and a young lady (no sorry, a young girl) was very nasty to my family and berated us for doing exactly what you hostess told us to do. If she worked for me, I would have fired her on the spot.

    "text": "This place is Fantastic! The price is great - you pay per bay and play up to 6 people. Each persone pays a \"membership\" of $5.00 but if you ever go again you won't have to pay as it is a lifetime membership. The food and drink prices were great. Most of our group had never golfed other than putt-putt and we all had a great time. Service was wonderful and we didn't have to wait long for our bay. There are bars and cornhole boards to keep you occupied until your bay is ready. The prices change with time so if you want the cheapest price go before noon! We played on level 2 and it was great. Level 3 is more expensive and the bays are a little more posh but for us level 2 was perfect. there is a pool etc on the 4th level. If you are on the Strip you can take a shuttle right from the MGM lobby in the TopGolf Lounge - it is complementary.  Visited June 2016",

    "text": "Great facility for parties or groups of friends. The fact that each ball is tracked and displayed on the screen is awesome. It's very similar to bowling alleys that display which pins you hit. My only gripe is that their video system for our bay got very buggy in the beginning when one of the names that was registered stopped showing up. To took them about 7 minutes (of our purchased hour) to get things working again. Then towards the end of our hour their app started slowing down and would take 2-3 minutes each time before being able to dispense a ball which eventually ate into our hour. And they weren't able to extend our time anymore l so we were able to get our money's worth.   Overall it was a good experience and my family enjoyed it. I'm sure it's an easy fix for them and it probably doesn't happen much. Just disappointed it happened to us. I'd definitely go back next time I'm in Vegas and even throw a party there.",

Last week went to their \"Movie at the Pool\" and while the movie was showing, there was no sound!  Asked the bartender what was going on with it and he said he didn't know.  And that was it!  Seriously?   Finished our drinks and left out of frustration.    Went back this week for a corporate event.  Checked in at the Corporate Event desk and was told, \"I'm not sure, I think it's on the 3rd floor.\"  Mistakenly walked up to the 4th floor, asked again about the event and was only told we're \"on the wrong floor, check at the Corporate Event desk downstairs.\"  Instead went down to the 3rd floor, was told there were no events on that floor and finally an employee went downstairs with us to figure it out.  Finally found the event, nice food and decent drinks.  Goes to show once again it's SERVICE that makes and breaks a place a lot faster than prices, facilities, and food.",

Showed up at 9:30pm on a Wednesday night thinking we shouldn't have any problem getting in. They told us the top two floors were reserved for private events (even though there were probably 20 unused bays on those floors) and the bottom two floors had a 1.5 hour wait. Really? 1.5 hour wait on a Wednesday night at 9;30pm? Okay.  Anyway, we waited and played for a couple of hours. We spent $350 on food/drinks/golf. Our time ended sometime after midnight. No more than 5 minutes after we finished, an employee brings up the next group and tells us we have to leave. THERE WERE AT LEAST 10 OTHER BAYS OPEN ON THAT FLOOR AND IT WAS AFTER MIDNIGHT! You're going to kick us out and not let us even finish our drinks at the bay we were in? After we dropped $350? Piss poor customer service here.   The employee that did it noticed that we were pretty upset about this and must have realized he screwed up because he kept apologizing, but we'd had enough at that point.",

    "text": "First time at TopGolf. Previewed it online to see what to expect and see why everyone was talking about it. It actually looked pretty cool so I went to check it out with some of my buddies. Let's start with the good news and I'll end it with the bad:  Positives:  - The concept is pretty cool, it's kind of like going to a bowling alley. Instead of bowling alleys, they have \"bays\". Each bay can have up to 10 people but only 6 can be logged on to play. Another difference is, you don't take turns driving the ball, but instead, you have 20 balls \"per game\" and you can switch off between people by selecting your name on the screen at any time. You pay for bays on the hour so if you're a good and efficient hitter, you can get in more than one game.   - Food and drinks are normal, nothing special. This place is on the strip so expect to pay above average  - Environment is great. There is uptempo music on floors 3&4 ($75.00 per hour on bays) and kid-friendly bays are on floors 1&2 ($60.00 per hour)  - The views on these bays are unbelievable. You can see the strip and it's beautiful. There are also 4 big screen TVs for you to watch sports  - Great place to hang out to drive balls  Cons:  - They DO NOT have a parking lot. They only have valet at the moment. If you want self-parking, you have to park at MGM. Supposedly there's a shuttle, but I took my chances and walked. It's right across the street and took me 5 minutes.   - If you self-parked, it's a journey because you have to walk along Wet Republic and it's quite confusing if you miss the directions.   - TopGolf has installed amazing technology for the range of your balls to be tracked. But if you do not hit inside the targets, you get a ZERO. It's ridiculous for you to hit a ball very far out and if it doesn't land on a target, you receive a goose egg.   That's about it, I guess for the money I spend to hit balls, I'd rather go to a cheaper regular driving range and if I'm going to spend $60 per hour. I'd rather go to a golf course. That's why I gave this place 3 stars. Nothing special, but also not basic.   I would recommend going here just to experience it though, quite a few celebrities already stopped by this place and it's not your typical driving range.",

    "text": "We had a blast at Top Golf!!! We went during the daytime on a Monday around 4:00pm so obviously it wasn't as busy as the weekends. I would expect a long wait on weekends and probably wouldn't come on weekends as a local unless someone else was already here. We waited for about 2 hours for a bay which wasn't bad because we ate the food while we waiting and it was pretty good food. The kids had a lot of fun playing with the bean bags and other games they provided while we waited. The couches are really comfortable to sit on as well.   Golf was so fun!!!! We ended up staying for 3 hours rather than 1 hour. It's impossible to just stay an hour, so be prepared to cough up more money for a longer stay. It's quite addicting. My favorite part was that there were HEATERS above us in the bay, so it was perfect as it got a little cold when the sun started setting.   The only negative thing I have to say: the Bay seats up to 10 people, however only 6 people can golf at a time, and they never told us that up front. So we were kind of disappointed that we couldn't have the kids have their own section, we had to share golf balls with them and it affected our scores (and we are really competitive family).  Other than that, we had a great time and the service was great. We waited a little and paid a lot.... but it's Vegas, you've gotta be used to that.",

    "text": "I can't believe I just gave a golf place 4 stars... I was a skeptic before showing up, but here's the rundown:   The excellent:  * The golf - Lots of fun. I'm not a golfer, most of the people in our group of 15 were not golfers. We got a \"private suite\" with two bays in it for golfing, and it was perfect for our group of 15. We didn't actually follow the rules, we just hit balls, and everyone had fun.   * The food - This was the biggest shock for me. The food was actually REALLY good. We had a BBQ plate, and the meat was awesome. It came with delicoius texas toast, and pickled veggies. It was great. The sushi plate was surprisingly great also. One of the \"rolls\" had crispy rice as a base, and it was awesome. I'm craving some now.   The not so great:   * The drinks - This was a big bummer. The drinks were REALLY watered down. Drinks on casino floors are better than these drinks here, and these were expensive. Order a bottle and mixers instead of individual drinks unless you like something really specific.   * The cost - It wasn't cheap. I wasn't paying, but I know we had a $1100 bar and food minimum for our group, and it wasn't hard to spend it. That's on top of the cost of golf (which I think was $500/hour ???)  All in all, it was a lot of fun, and if someone else is paying I'd do it again.",

I had told her I was ordering for everyone in the group and she went to ask for orders from everyone else without telling them I had already ordered for everyone. In the end, the management took responsibility and apologized. Overall, great staff who learns quickly. Fun environment for sure! I would come back",

We ordered some appetizers, solo drinks, and a big tank of beer....total with tip for the 4 of us came out to $280...definitely not cheap but the experience was cool...",

I don't know how to golf at all and I was terrible playing it here but I think it's just a good spot to hang out with friends. There's plenty of TV's, food, drinks, and games to play. The wait was a bit much since there are no reservations when we went on a weekend - we waited almost 2 hours to get a bay in the lower level but the time goes by fast getting drinks, playing shuffleboard, and watching people fall off the mechanical bull! It's always entertaining watching people ride it :) It's nice to be outside of all the casinos in Vegas and get some fresh air out in the open at top golf so I feel like it's a good daytime activity to get you prepared for a long night out. Food was normal American bar food - we had flatbreads, sliders, tater tots, 2 bottles of red wine, and some beer. I would recommend coming here if you have some free time in Vegas - it's a chill place to hang out especially if you had a large group.",

We had a booth on the 4th floor, it's a whole lot quieter, and less people. I like that. However, you aren't allowed to use drivers there. The food was surprisingly delicious. There's a loop hole, if you drive it straight to the back, you get 50-75 points, versus 2-8 points if you hit the \"green\". This fancy driving range stuff is a great idea, I'm not sure why we don't see more of these elsewhere.",

He answered all of my questions and handled everything for us. We arrived and checked in after a very small wait giving us a chance to check out the other areas. He gave us a quick demo on how to use the golf machines and some pointers on how to maximize our fun. This is one of the best corporate events we've ever had. Everyone had an absolute blast. I can't wait to come back. Our server was ok, but honestly no one really noticed because we were all having so much fun. She wasn't overly motivated as I felt like I had to track her down to order drinks. I don't know maybe she was just letting us enjoy the golf. Either way it was so much fun. It's harder than it looks but also easy enough that pretty much anyone can enjoy themselves. My boss is 75 years old and he had a blast. Usually when we do these team building corporate events - he prefers to sit out and watch everyone else. I was so happy to see him enjoying himself and being competitive against the rest of us. Money well spent!   *My office did have some issues with trying to book the event for us but I wasn't involved in that at all so I won't let it alter my review. Once I was involved and dealing with Mike Lichwa everything was incredibly easy. I highly recommend calling him for any reservations.",

Just FYI, we came here last night at about 9:00 pm and there was a 1-hour wait for a bay. Uhhhh.....no thank you!  So there we were bright and early ready to hit some golf balls and have fun.   If a driving range and a bowling alley were to have a baby, this place is it! You're welcome to bring your own golf clubs but they also have some for you to borrow, even junior (kids) clubs. An employee walks you to your bay, explains some basics of the concept and enters your players names into the monitor. Similar to bowling, you pay by the hour, up to six players per bay. You will also pay a one-time $5 lifetime registration fee if it's your first time there.   The object is to hit the targets/flags/holes. The closer to the flag you get, the more points you score. There are a variety of specialty games listed at the back of the menu you can choose to play. Or you can just take turns hitting balls like a normal bowling game or driving range like we did.   If you're hungry or thirsty your own server comes around to take your food or drink orders and check on you, so similar to a restaurant or bar. We came early but didn't eat here. We had just eaten breakfast before we arrived so we had some water and juice. They had an Early Bird Grub Menu, with choices like breakfast burritos or mini doughnuts.   This is a great family place--Levels 1 & 2 only. There's cornhole/bean bag toss games and tabletop shuffleboard on the second level, as well. Lots of TVs in the common area where the cornhole and shuffleboard games are, as well as one in your bay and a few way out past the holes and targets.   For the Happy Hour and 21+ guests, levels 3 & 4 offer more bars and a swimming pool for you.   We would definitely come back here again!",

They also have a full bar with top shelf liquors if that is your taste. The food served was buffet style. Everything I tried was delicious. I think the smoked pork butt and macaroni and cheese were my favorites of the evening. The atmosphere is relaxed and I love that you do not have to be good at golf to have a great time.

The bartender was beyond nice and helpful. He had the food brought out to our table. The food was so good! We had the 7 layer dip (pre made in jar so you cant leave anything out was kind of a bummer) but it was delicious since I'm a sour cream fan. We also had the wings (bone in) buffalo and asian..The buffalo was delicious and preferred by the table, the asian was sweet and sticky. Good flavor. The sweet and sticky shrimp was also very good. Was very flavorful and cooked perfectly. The steak tacos and the pastor meat sticks were also a big hit at the table. Prices average for Vegas. Spent about $100 on the apps. Beer and drinks plentiful and a good variety. Cant review golf since we didn't do it but the room with band had A/C so that was a plus..I would definitely go back .",

The wait time is long but once you start playing it's a lot of fun! They serve alcohol and food so it's a good time. Most people here aren't very good so no worries if you can't play golf. You're basically just hitting balls and aiming them at things. Good stress relief and just pure entertainment. They have a nice lounge feel. One of my new favorite things to do!",

Very comfortable couches, with heaters on a cold day and AC during summer.  Prices vary by the time of the day and Day of the week, higher on the weekends and in the evenings. If you walk in on a Sunday morning, there is hardly any wait, can rent a booth for $45/hr that includes all the golf equipment and balls. There is a one time membership fee of $5. My kids love it here. Food is awesome and service is great too. We celebrated my son's birthday and our server Brian S. was the best! He took care of both our booths, helped our big group with setting up the game, refilled drinks so quick and excellent with food orders. He even got my son complimentary donut holes for his bday which were sooo good! They also have a kids menu. Nice drink menu for adults and wine list is great too. Oh the best part... 20% discount for locals on golf when you show your nevada ID WooHoo!!",

That's a powerful combination. Great idea to get golfers and newbies swinging away. The clubs are not great but so what. Give it a try and have fun.   One less star for the cost.....$60 per hour per stall. Bring a group and it's more fun and affordable.",

Hey? Las Vegas Top Golf?   Your place blows, the food sucks, its too expensive, YES YOU SURE DO NEED TO TAKE RESERVATIONS!!!!  Update:  Hugh D. from Top Golf got back to me to ask me to \"reach out to him\" so we can discuss the situation. Hey? Hugh? Get off of my rant!  All you need to do Hugh is read the first post again, comprehend the content, have a meeting with management to go over better food, fair pricing, reservations for actually participating in Top Golf experience by allowing customers to get into a Top Golf stall, stop running your business the way you currently do and change it soon.   Pretty simple Hugh.",

Idk.    Once we got settled and managed to get a drink the next hour and a half was very fun.

Topgolf is an excellent place for a social event in Vegas. A great alternative if you are not into clubbing, gambling, or shopping.   No skills required. I've been to a golf range less than a handful of times. I enjoyed the skill/arcade selections that are available to choose. I'm also impressed with how they have a way to track all your shots, including some of my god-embarrassing swings.   Service was reasonable. This place gets four-star because of the tiered price. It costs more to be at the third-floor than at first, and pricing varies depending on what time you play. Be prepared to pay a premium on the third-floor in the evening.",

The hosts gets everyone logged into the system quickly so you can get the game started quickly.  Servers swing by your bay at least every 15 minutes to check on your drinks and food.  Everyone is upbeat and very personable.  Service at the numerous bars have been hit or miss with me in the past.  Topgolf...golf and more:  This is a multi-tiered driving range with massive round targets to aim for and you get points for knocking golf balls in there.  They provide the clubs and have sets for men, women and even lefties.  Each bay has a flat screen near by and there's massive screens throughout the facility and even down the driving range.  This is a great place to watch sports as you hack at golf balls and grab drinks.  They have a decent bar food that pairs well with drinks.  It's a little pricey for the volume of food you receive but is pretty tasty overall.  Cornhole sets and tabletop shuffleboard is open to all and free to play.  There's a small pool to lounge by during the summer months. Overall the bill can add up quickly but the Topgolf experience is a blast.   You don't have to be a serious golfer to play and it's favorite for my out of town visitors.  hite em straight!",

We had a freaking blast!   When we arrived for our reservation, which was 7pm on a Monday evening, they were really busy, but still accommodated us quickly. Checking in was easy, we stood off to the side for a little bit, and then we  were led to our table/ golf bay. (Which was dead center second floor- AKA the perfect middle of the whole place).   Most of us had been before but the server explained everything for those who hadn't and set up our screen so that we were ready to go, which was super nice. We ordered drinks and just started playing! The only thing that would've made this a better experience, is if I won. Ha!   My sister in law ended up winning twice. We were trying to keep the party going, so we ordered buckets of Mich Ultra and Miller Lite. Our drinks came promptly throughout the night and service was excellent. We order some appetizers while we played, the nachos and the Brussels sprouts were piping hot and delicious. Honestly, I was more focused on golfing than anything else.   I cannot forget, however, the donut holes. They surprise brought out donuts because someone had told them it was my birthday. There were these syringes that had icing in them, you pump the donut holes with icing and then pop them in your mouth. It's the perfect dessert while you're golfing. No mess, one bite. The donuts were baked perfectly and super warm when served.   When in Vegas, you gotta' Top Golf, y'all.",

Without a doubt, you'll be entertained.   Pick a floor, rent a bay, order some food/drinks, have fun. Repeat! Check the website for pricing. Better to come with a group to share the cost. Free parking but it's limited, valet is available too. Weekends get crazy so come early or try to make it out during the week. They close at 2am and the pool closes at 9pm so be mindful of that.   Locals 20% discount available.  Check out the Memberships too.",

Not being a golfer and having hosted several events at Top Golf locations around d the country I have to say I was less than thrilled to spend a night at a golf venue.  Never say never - the experience was none less than awesome - great food - we had the bbq buffet - and fun nightcap of injectable donuts - a must !!  I have to say the gold was fun but the people are what make it !  Definitely a great alternative to the casino !",

The staff was very attentive and had food and drinks flowing the entire time.  There were a couple of TVs in the suite as well as ample seating.  The nice thing is there's something for everyone - even if you're not into golf!    The driving range is brand new and has an awesome view of Vegas.  Giant TV screens at the end of the range are an amazing option - I've never seen anything like it!  Overall, a huge success and everyone had a blast!  Thank you TopGolf for a great time!",

Of course, if you're at Vegas, you go big. Reserve a bay, smack some balls with your friends, enjoy a Modelo beer tower or three, and place bets on who can do it better. What better way is there to kill a couple of hours before you attend some shows. Keep in mind that there are plenty of other games here and loads of TVs. AC is just overhead cooling fans though, so expect to get toasty.",

    "text": "We heard a lot about Topgolf as they're scheduled to open on O'ahu and looked forward to previewing them while in Las Vegas.  Since we had just eaten brunch within the MGM Grand, we followed the arrows out through the pool area.  We didn't know about the shuttle service that will take  you from the MGM Grand's entrance to Topgolf until after this preview.  Anyway, we went in to check out the facility and got the fee structure for play on the different golf bay levels (Levels 1 - 3) AND the play times (9AM - NOON; NOON - 5PM or 5PM - Close) from the friendly starters.  YOUR PLAY TIME IS CHARGED HOURLY.  Also, they do not take reservations unless you're there for a pre-arranged group function.   There is a $5 membership fee per person that will be charged and can be used at all Topgolf facilities.     Being in Las Vegas where it's hot and dry, we noted misters at each bay to help keep the players cool.  Each bay is sectioned off by comfortable and nice sofas and there are rental clubs for both men and women.  You can select from a number of games to play with your group as this experience is target golf and NOT just a driving range where you'll see more the long ball hitters.  Also, unlike the actual game of golf where the lowest score wins, the target games will award the high score.  We returned during early evening and stayed for 2 hours.  Playing during the early evening appealed to us as it was a bit cooler and not as blinding from the sunlight.  We got to enjoy their bar and gourmet golf course snacks and the good service.  However, during our play, we did have a computer glitch that caused us to pause for 10 minutes until we were told that they're still working out \"bugs\". Both the scoring and golf ball tracking were inconsistent.  We managed to complete our games but didn't get credited for the 10 minute loss.  SUMMARY: It was a good and fun first time experience for most levels of golfers and non-golfers.  It was sort of like a driving range with nightclub atmosphere with all of the colored lights and music going on.",

So she did okay for serving our tables although I feel she should of needed more help due to us having to wait a little longer for what we needed.  I ordered the sweet crispy shrimp. It had a spiciness to it rather than sweet that I had to order ranch dressing to offset the heat. Other than that it was okay. Other friends at my table enjoyed their food they ordered. The hosts that seated all of us were very friendly. The comedy show was good. This venue is always fun and lots to do here. They also have a bar right outside the entrance of the comedy show. I would go back to try the golf and come back again to see another comedy show and try other food items on their menu.",

Pricing is cheaper if you come in the morning....you pay by what level bay you get and price is per bay not per person. So the more people you come with, the cheaper it will be. If there is a long wait, there's plenty to do. There's swimming pools, food, bar and some fun activities to do while you wait. So we got level 3 which was 47 dollars since we got seated at our bay before noon and we ended up extended half an hour because it was so fun. Ordered drinks and food and everything was really tasty. If you're a first time golfer, it's a lot harder than it looks. But you get the hang of it after awhile. Come see for yourself because we had an amazing time. Next time we'll try it out at night.",

First time was on a Saturday, we had to wait about 1 hour to get our lane. The second time was on a Monday we arrived around 12am and stayed till closing 2am, absolutely no waiting paid and went up to the 3rd floor. I recommend 3rd floor it's more pricy then 1st and 2nd floor and pricing increase on Fridays and weekends. I'm not a golfer or have I ever played golf but this place is really cool and if you come with a group you tend to become very competitive. Plus you kill about 2 hours of your time preventing you from playing in the casinos and loosing your money. They also serve alcohol and food, have not tried their food but will on our 3rd trip.",

Get a group together, because depending on the day of the week, your price is per group, and when it is split it is really affordable!   If you don't play golf don't fret (I sure as heck don't) - check out the adults bar and pool Lounge area on the 3rd floor! It's where I spent most of my time while the guys golfed. Great Loungers and cabanas by the pool, and the place wasn't crowded at all!  Our servers were great, with the exception of Bryce at the swim up bar. He got a little snooty when I asked if I could order drinks in the pool and have them charged to our table. OBVIOUSLY while I am in the pool in your swim up bar that you provide, I am not carrying cards or cash on me. It only makes sense to charge them to the table. He begrudgingly did it, but it came off as rude to me (and I have 8 years of service and bar tending experience). The rest of the staff was great, and so accommodating with our separate bar bills and confusing last names.  Lastly, the food we had was great! We ordered the rock shrimp, the edamame, and the donut holes. I would go back for all three - they were yum! I was rather surprised at the quality and effort they put into the food there.  I definitely see myself coming back here again. It's nice to have other things to do in Vegas but still have a great time - and from families to adult drinking groups this place is sure to please everyone.",

    "text": "Even though I haven't golfed before, and I found out that I ain't cut out to \"drive the ball\" either, it was honestly fun.  I have to attribute it to the friendly hosts that check patrons in and the wait staff at/for the bays. The hostesses at the check-in counter gave us the run-down on how it works (e.g. letting us know to let the wait staff know to apply the locals discount). The actually hostess that registered all the players and how their system works was also pretty nice. Wait staff was awesome and friendly like everyone else - checked on us multiple times during the game.  Food was also yummy. The family enjoyed the shrimp and garlic flatbread.  Only criticism has got to be us being confused and not given any direction/checked on by anyone when we were trying to just order food/drinks before being sent to our bay.  I think I spent around $190 for our group of 7 in 1 bay for a 1 hour game. The breakdown of it was paying for first-time registry of all the players, a locals discount for the bay/hour game, 3 plates of food (shrimp, edamame and flatbread) and 2-4 alcoholic drinks.  The family enjoyed it quite a bit to want to go back and improve, but we'd make adjustments like request 2 bays for a whole group of us - it was kinda tightly spaced, especially when we ordered food and drinks. Plus it's hard to completely finish a game without feeling rushed for a group of 7.",

Great way to hang out, play some friendly (and competitive!) rounds of golf, drink and eat.  There are three levels here and the third level has a swimming pool. The entire floor was booked for a private event so I haven't seen it myself, but how dope does that sound? Also, our hostess informed us that it can get very busy with a 4-hr wait here, but luckily, we were seated right away.  It's set at an hourly rate and each person gets a membership card. There are golf clubs for both men and women and a list of games to choose from. Each golf ball has a microchip that can record where it lands to accurately track the score.   I found that cool af. We had a few issues getting the game set up and some problems with the player rotation, but Lela was sure to get it resolved as soon as possible.  Food was also good! Our favorites were the rock shrimp and the sliders. I would recommend checking this place out if you wanted to do something different in LV.",

So we waited, but the time went fast especially with drinks.  We got to explore the other levels and the views were so nice. The pools are more like tanning pools. I think the deepest I saw was 3'6. There's one on the 3rd level and the 4th.  When our Bay was ready, Kyle showed us the ropes. He was really cool and explained everything. Once he left and we got playing, our system glitched. So we had a staff member to restart the game. Then the system screen froze *rolls eyes*. We had to get Charlie (I think he was the supervisor or manager) to fix that. THEN the censor for the golf balls to come out stopped working! Charlie had a system maintenance worker come restart the entire system for our Bay. Afterwards, every thing worked smoothly. Charlie even got the birthday boy a shot on the house as well as donut holes for the table and these cookie sandwiches. Those donuts with the filling were really tasty! They even added more time to our Bay.  Then came the checks. So you can have up to 10 people at your Bay, but they can only split the bill 6 ways *OMGEEEE* -_- so that had to be figure out but our server Johnie worked it out somehow. Besides the kinks, everybody had a really fun night. Not sure if I'll be back any time soon though.",

All of the staff was very friendly, but I do think they forgot about us.  They stopped coming over when we had about 20 minutes left. When the game was over, it told us to wait for our server to give us the bill, but no one ever came back.  Eventually they brought another group up to take our spot, but we hadn't even gotten to pay yet.  I think it was just a little miscommunication, but we felt weird about it nonetheless.  I would recommend doing this if you have a few night, or are looking for something to do before going out!

    "text": "This place is kind of a cool concept. Instead of a standard driving range, there are targets and all the balls are microchipped so you can tell exactly how far you hit and if you hit any targets. It gives a bit of a competitive element to the game.   Think of it like paying for a bowling lane by the hour. You get up to 6 players in one bay and each round is 20 balls per player. You can decide how to divvy that up with your party. Just touch the screen to change players.  I feel an hour is a bit short for a game if you are playing leisurely. We kinda had to rush a bit towards the end of the hour to finish our game. We had 5 people. I think if you have 6 people playing, you may need more than 1 hour if you want to drink and play at the same time.  Service was good and staff was friendly. We played at noon on a Friday, so the cost was $60 for a floor 2 bay. The prices change depending on the time of day. Evening/Night hours are the most expensive, but probably the most beautiful with all the Vegas lights. I think mornings might be best for a summer day so it isn't too hot and you can still see where you are hitting the ball.",

    "text": "Topgolf Las Vegas is very nice. Great location to see the fire works on NYE. My family and I decided to do something different for New Year's and rent a bay at Topgolf. We knew about the $250 deposit that was required before booking for their private event. Which included 3 hours of golfing for up to 6 people, unlimited well drinks (below $10) and soda. Of course you have to pay for food, which isn't unreasonably priced.   We show up around 9pm, check in and went straight to our bay. I had myself, two kids which weren't golfing, my parents, sister and boyfriend. I was told that there was going to be a fee for the children even if they weren't golfing because \"they rented out the place for this event so they were limited on space.\" In the contact it states \"each area accommodates a specific number of guests. Should your guest count increase beyond the capacity of the area reserved for your group, Topgolf will accommodate additional guests if possible, based on availability, and a $20 per person surcharge along with other applicable per person charges will be applied to your final invoice.\" I had no idea that the surcharge was going to be $150. I of course argued that the price was not mentioned in the contract and that's ridiculous to pay that for a 3 year old. A manager came to me and said they he'll reach out to the GM to see what they can do. Came back with $99 again for my 3 year old. Long story short, we received our receipt and saw that she was basically charged the adult beverage package, but she's a child.   I understand that the extra adult that came was $150, which I have no problem with, but to charge a child $99 for alcohol she can't drink is beyond ridiculous. Make sure you read your contract with them and ask questions, because it's not a very detailed contract. This isn't the first time Topgolf has basically screwed me over, but it's certainly the last.  Update: Carrie from Topgolf, was very professional and provided great customer service to get to the bottom of what happened. I must say I am very satisfied and I appreciate her efforts. Thanks Carrie!",

As we were walking thru the parking lot we saw a valet attendant running thru the lot pushing a car key to see which one beeps.  We thought nothing of it until we were leaving and the valet attendant asked us \"Which car is yours?\"  ummm, what!?!?  Then they asked us where are keys were, seriously?!!??  So 40 minutes later they found our car and they left the keys inside the car.  So obviously the valet system is crazy, they take cars, theres no records or policies in place on how they handle your car or keys. Another hiccup.  When we checked in the counter person said it would be a 2 hour wait, we almost walked away, but with 8 of us we just figured we'd get some drinks and see how it goes.  10 minutes later they text us and say the booth is ready.  WTF?  We almost walked, and when we got upstairs there were plenty of booths open.  Why would they say 2 hours?  Do they want people to leave? We had a great time golfing and the waitstaff was attentive.  The place is great for a group and kids.",

The venue is nice and the concept is very fun but you can only valet park or you have to walk from the MGM; just like I have to choose a star even though I would give this business NO STARS.   And if you want to be told what you can and cannot afford, then you might enjoy Top Golf!! Upon ordering food with our server and expecting it to come out we then find out the kitchen closed with no last call but our server took our order like it was okay. Once the manager got involved and said, \"we apologize for your server not informing you of the kitchen closing, we will get the order in complimentary.\" Long story short the server brought a bill to the table even though management said it would be complimentary. Upon clarifying with her she responds, \"I knew that was going to happen, I knew someone like you wouldn't pay\". Not sure if it's cause I'm African American but the bill was not paid and the food was returned to the kitchen since I couldn't afford it. Even a manger who was African American couldn't get me to change my mind. Thank you for attempting to be my accountant, but I didn't go for that purpose!   I will not recommend to anyone and not interested in helping resolve the issue because I will not even come 50ft within this place when I have to consider that I will be discriminated against ... I'm almost turned off that MGM name has to be dragged through the dirt cause of this place. Created a Yelp just to post this so thank you for allowing me to rant and inform others of this prejudice and stereotypical business.",

    "text": "I'll start with TopGolf is a fun place to hang out. The facility itself is well put together from the furniture, lounge, bars, view, etc. There's no doubt that this is overall a very cool place. However, I am unimpressed with the staff/service. Being a local I am very understanding of service in vegas - good and bad. I am easy going when service is bad, but also extremely appreciative when service is good. I will say that I am very critical on service because I have worked behind and in front of the bar as well as managed restaurants and other departments.  With all that being said, me and my girlfriend were excited to check out TopGolf since we've never been. When we arrived we were hungry so we decided to check everything out to get our bearings, eat, and then play. We were approached by a women (who I didn't catch her name) she was very helpful and started to explain where everything was until we were interrupted by a gentleman who said that he would take us up. He introduced himself (keone) and asked us if we worked at SLS, and confused we said, no, and kept walking. I questioned where we we're going and what we were doing. I wasn't sure if he thought we were someone else or if he was just showing us the facility. I was kind of ignored and we kept walking. He sat us at a bay and then came back with three other girls to join our group... which us or the other girls were not expecting. We were all very confused because at some point he thought we asked for bay 302. Which was completely wrong we never said a word about meeting any one or had said the number 302 because we didn't even know that it existed. Keone literally came out of no where and told us to follow him. To make matters worse, he tried to put us at his friend's bay who was an older gentleman that was there by himself next to where he sat us to make up for the confusion. He said that it was okay and we can order whatever we want. It was just really uncomfortable and awkward. I'm pretty sure that he was a manager which made it weirder. We both were being very nice and took a couple swings thanked them for their time, but we really just wanted to go get some lunch. We went to the nearest bar and was greeted by bartender, Agnes. We were the only two at the bar, and then shortly after 3 other gentlemen came and sat for some drinks. I ordered the strawberry jalapeno margartia. Since I have bartended I like to watch how my drinks are made, and it was very apparent that Agnes was an inexperienced bartender. Which, to her defense, she may have been trained to make her cocktails a specific way, but she really just exuded lack of confidence behind the bar. She built the cocktail with ingredients, dropped some cut up strawberries, rolled the drink a few times, and poured it over ice. The strawberries weren't muddled, and the cocktail wasn't shaken with any ice. Again, she may have been trained that way, but the cocktail was so mediocre and aesthetically unappealing. It just seemed lazy to me. Agnes lacked personality, she barely spoke, wasn't very attentive, and didn't really smile. We ordered our food. I asked for no onions on my burger.... got onions. I ended up picking it off myself. It's just annoying because it was slow and she only had 5 people sitting at her bar and we were the only 2 eating which means that it was a careless mistake. If it was a full bar and you're getting your butt kicked I can understand forgetting to type in \"no onions\". The food was extremely delicious, and they have great options on their menu! So, I'd say the first hour of being there was just so awkward and annoying just from the staff/service alone. We finally get checked in and are waiting to be walked to our bay. The girl at the check in didn't have much personality either she lacked confidence as well. Everything seemed a bit unorganized. We get walked to our bay, and I wish I remembered her name, we finally had someone with personality that was cracking some jokes, and made me laugh. We finally played some TopGolf and was having a good time. We went when it was 108 degrees outside @4pm. I assumed that there would be AC which it looks like it was set up, but it wasn't on/working.   The game itself was a lot of fun. A bit pricey, but I didn't mind spending the money. The staff seems inexperienced/lost, and it shows that there wasn't a lot of fundamental training done or guidance from management. The employees just seem really socially awkward/goofy which is okay, but there has to be some level of professionalism. Hopefully they tie up loose ends with staff so that everything is seamless from check in - ordering - check out and farewell.",

I admit it took me a few swings not just to get the hang of it, but also to understand what I was aiming for. Maybe I missed the super-obvious instructions but they would benefit from some larger flat-screens or just signage?  And the heaters seemed to only have two settings - Surface of the Sun & Off. Maybe dial that in a bit?   But I'd definitely host another work event or birthday party here. Definitely concur with the reviews that say Top Golf is to golf as Lucky Strike is to bowling.",

They also have signs all along the walk way to guide you to your destination (Top Golf)  My favorite thing about Top Golf is that you can come and enjoy their pools, their pool table, their giant tvs, their outdoor bars, their corn hole, their ping pong tables without playing golf. I also loved their delicious food and drink menu as well as an amazing view of the high roller (Linq).  This is a nice chill place with great food that is worth a try.",

We are in Vegas for NYE and he brought us for early lunch and an hour to hit golf balls. It was $45 for an hour to rent a bay to hit balls.  My boys really enjoyed themselves hitting balls on the second floor. This place is huge, there are a lot of different seating areas and games to play if you don't want to play golf.  They have a great food and drink menu. We ordered the breakfast sandwich from the early bird specials and a flatbread pizza.  To our surprise that was enough for 4 of us.  The food and service was great!  The staff here are really on it and very nice.  This place is family friendly so if you have little ones you can bring them along.  It's a little pricey but it was worth all the fun we had as a family.  It was an awesome experience for us!",

    "text": "I married into a golf family, so when we visited Vegas, this was a must for a night out.   I'm Scottish, but I'd never swung a golf club. That didn't really matter here. It's kind of like bowling for golf enthusiasts.  It was a relatively quiet Monday night, several other groups around but it kind of felt like we had the place to ourselves. The booth was comfortably big enough for the 7 of us, the servers were friendly and efficient, and we got stuck in right away. It was getting quite chilly but the climate controls worked a treat.   I have no basis for comparison here, but everything was in good nick, there were full sets of clubs which were all in great condition, and the computer controls were a bit finnicky but manageable. You take 5 turns at a time and I think around 30 strokes total. There are goals to hit, like aiming for the various markers, but for beginners it's really just about hitting the ball and seeing how far you can make it. The drinks were flowing and we got a few snacks, too, making it an enjoyable couple of hours.  I think we paid around $200 for the time. With drinks and tips it rounded off to around $500 - for a couple hours entertainment for 7 people, including drinks and snacks, it's not cheap but not too bad for Vegas. I'd come back.",

It is a lounge with a bar and several lanes (like bowling) where you can hit the ball onto a legit golf course. I was surprised I could even hit the ball (only a couple of times) but they do have a computerized system where they keep track of your points based on how far you hit the ball.   They have a pretty decent beer selection and they were accommodating with setting up a good buffet (Southern food!). It's very much a lounge - no dance floor or anything. It was mostly guys unless there were other group events like us where it was more co-ed.   The scene was pretty casual - no need for preppy, golf attire. There were also people looking fancy who were ready to go to the club but plenty of others chilling in jeans.   Fun event!",

No point in golfing without the view from upstairs. So we decided to stick around and have lunch. Unfortunately a big mistake.   Service was friendly. Food on the other hand was overwhelmingly mediocre. Typically we're golfing and drinking so the food has been an afterthought. Everything was extremely overpriced, even given the location.   Jalapeno Cornbread Muffins were oddly dry. Couldn't peel them off of the roof of my mouth. House-Marinated Steak Skewers were average. Where were all of the shishito peppers like in the pic?? So generous with all 4 peppers. They've created a great atmosphere there, but serving food like that will certainly make us think twice before venturing over again.",

Shanking your 7 iron definitely doesn't suck nearly as bad when you've got the bright lights of Vegas to bring your spirits up before the next shot. Also, the service staff here was totally top notch, but that's to be expected in Vegas.   If you've never done TopGolf before, beware that it's not really the best place to work out your swing at. It's more like the driving range version of Lucky Strike Bowling, so it's more made for group outings, birthdays, or in my case...a bachelor party.   This is the perfect activity to pump up a Vegas weekend that isn't drinking yourself silly or losing your life at the tables.",

VALET KEYS ARE EXPENSIVE TO REPLACE! *Hoping* they find my key in the next 48 hours, otherwise they will need to pay to replace that key, OR better yet, pay to have the whole key system to my car replaced since they don't know where that valet key is or who has it.  There were numerous chances that Top Golf *could* have shined with positive customer service, yet they are a day late and a buck short, and clearly they are SEVERELY lacking in proper communication among their team.   They want to compensate me with free golf?! I HATE GOLF! I didn't even play golf on 11/25/16!! I was there to hangout with friends who were visiting from out of town and to be their DD! Yea, let me go back to the place with mediocre customer service, where they make you valet because there aren't enough parking spots, annnnd then they lose your car keys! Sounds great! #BOTTOMGOLF",

    "text": "Mixed review. 5 stars Luxury oasis one day- No stars swarm of needs unmet locust people the next day!  Don't reserve - walk in, save $$.  Thursday this place was shangri-la. Had the place to ourselves- great hitting bays with the newest Calloway clubs. We brought our own Calloways which were about 2 years old- and made a direct comparison with the latest technology. Pools are 21+ and no smoking- which makes them paradise in this city.  But the following day- we were met in the parking lot by staff, telling us that something 'happened' which delayed the opening on Friday until noon. When we arrived back at noon- there was a sea of newly arrived unhappy tourists jammed in the lobby(some with luggage) - hot and complaining. Not enough staff on the job to process the large glut of people. Plus - there is no bag drop off on the first floor. You have to lug your clubs up a long flight of stairs to get to the lobby. Games concept here is far better than other TopGolf Venues- you rent the bay by the hour, and the ball dispenser is superior at this location. You never know what conditions you will encounter at this schizo location- so don't bother reserving. That way you can just go do something else.",

Yes there could be a long wait it is a popular place.  But while you are waiting there is a lot to see and do.  From cornhole to shuffle board and food and drinks you should never be bored.

    "text": "This is the new joint that opened up in Vegas.  Came here with a few colleagues after CES and we got a booth.  We ordered a bunch of appetizers, drinks, and a few rounds of golf.  It's a golfing range so you just swing into the lit up colored zones.  I have never swung a golf club before so this was an interesting experience.  Made me realize that there is a lot more technique to golf than just swinging the stick.  The booth tallied our points depending on which zone you land in and gives you points.  It was windy that night, but they had a heating system right above the booth that helped with that.  The only annoying thing would probably be the booth chairs that we sat in.  It kept sliding apart because people would be getting up and sitting down a lot which shifted the chairs and creating a gap so you would have to keep pushing it together.  If they had like a long chair instead of a bunch of smaller chairs put together to make a long chair that would probably solve that issue.",

They told us it would be a 45 min wait (even though while checking in there were TONS of open stalls) we ended up waiting close to 2 hours. While waiting we sat at a table to have some drinks and had to wait for about 20 before a server came by and that was only after we asked if they could have someone come and take our drink order. To apologize for making us wait so long they said they would comp our first hour of play but when the server gave us our check at the end it was for the full price. It just sucked.

    "text": "Great experience! It was super fun. They charge you a $5 membership fee for each new player. They only charge you per bay per hour, which is nice, but if you have too large of a group, you'll need more than an hour. It was my first time \"golfing\" and it was super fun! It was difficult to get the hang of at first because my balls were just flying diagonally but after trying all the clubs, it's kind of fun. There are different clubs for men and women (I assume the clubs for men have a little more weight to them). There are a lot of different games that you can play. I only played TopShot because I wanted to try to aim for accuracy. There are 3 different levels, the level that you check in on where the bar is, is the 2nd level (I thought it was the first). You have to be 21+ to be on the 3rd level and it cost a tad bit more.   ~~Parking: I personally walked here from the MGM, but there is PENTY of parking b/c I've seem most other people walking here or using a rideshare.   ~~Liked: It's a great way to destress and have some fun!   ~~Worst part: The waiting.....I would go around 10 and the wait times would already be 2 - 3 hours (I tried going one day and decided not to wait, but returned the second day and left my number to be texted when the bay would be ready).   ~~Service: Okay. The cashier had said that I would receive a text when my bay is ready and if I ventured off out side that I would be able to text that I'm about 15, 30, or 1 hr away. I was at the MGM and said that I would be arriving in about 15 min, but they texted saying back that I had been placed back on the waitlist. At least the second one was about a 20 min wait in comparison to the 3 hr wait previously.   ~~Tip: Go to the MGM Grand hotel and talk to someone in the lobby @ the TopGolf desk that they have b/c they have a $10 off (which can help pay off your membership fee if you are new)   ~~Return: Yup!",

We had one guy chuck a club at us because he wasn't holding on tight enough so that was interesting. No other issues though! Staff is nice.  Expect high prices just as anywhere else in Vegas. Top floor will run you $75 per hour, cocktails $15-20. Beer is average price. Food is above average price but totally depends on what you get.   Long wait times on weekend nights. They can run up to 2 hours so come here ready to drink and play a few bar games or leave and eat some dinner. They text you when they're ready for you to get started, but you can request more time and specify how long which is very nice since a lot of people do choose to leave and come back.  We have been here once on a weekend night with a short wait time- only a 25 minutes that once.  My one complaint is that I ordered two things from the menu and they never brought it because the time was down to 15 minutes and we weren't adding on. They never told me they wouldn't be bringing it out and didn't give the option to bring it to one of the tables or bar area so that was super annoying since I just kept waiting and waiting for it to arrive until they kicked us out of the booth. Hello?? Where's my food?? Other than that one time incident nothing bad. Pizza is a small flat bread but delicious regardless.",

    "text": "What a cool spot! My family and I had a few hours to kill before our flight home, so I decided to bring them to Topgolf. My mom recently took up golf as a pastime, and I thought this would be the perfect place for her. We parked our rental in their huge (uncovered) parking lot and made our way up the stairs to the lobby area. The prices were clearly marked behind the front desk, which varied depending on the amount of time spent playing, the floor chosen, and the time of day.   We were only there for an hour on the 2nd of 3 floors after 12pm, and our price was $45 vs $60+ for the 3rd floor (21+ only). We had a runner greet us and bring us to our bay, where she showed us how to register each of our players into the computer system. The seating area was heated and had a great view of the Strip.  In our short time at Topgolf, we all had a blast and were able to enjoy some of their shareable plates and have a few drinks while we were at it. Everything came out relatively quickly, giving us just enough time to return our rental car and head to the airport.   Tip: Review your bill carefully! You may want to base the gratuity on the total for your food and drinks only, minus the price for the game and any registration fees.  Enjoy!",

Good music, drinks and food available that come straight to your bay (love their chicken wings :p), and games to play while you wait. They have huge, like HUGEEEE, big screen TVs to watch all games inside (with lots of seating, first come first serve) and outside past the range. Also, there are multiple bars on every level to grab a drink while you wait.  In the summer they have the AC blasting in your bay and in winter, they've got heaters to offset the cold!  The reason I knock off a star is because there is usually always a wait. While they have so many bays on 4 different levels, they're always busy! They accept reservations but I believe there is a minimum to reserve.  I highly recommend this place to those who want some non-nightlife activity, especially for bachelor parties.",

The first time I came to Topgolf was a few weeks ago on a Saturday afternoon around 2pm, and the wait to golf was around 4 hours. Although I didn't end up golfing the first time around, it was still fun because topgolf has an area for shuffleboard, bean bag toss, ping pong, and great places to just lounge!   Learning from my mistake, my friends and I came again at 11am on a Saturday and the wait was only 1-2 hours. We only ended up waiting around an hour. The price was $60/hour, with $5 membership fee for first time top golf players.  Besides playing golf, we ordered some drinks and food to share. My friends and I ordered sweet potato fries, nachos, burgers with tator tots, sliders, and korean beef tacos.  The food was delicious, but on the slightly pricer side, $15-20 per order.",

The concept is fantastic!  This Topgolf location Appears to be well run, staff is friendly, service is good, clean bathrooms. We requested a left handed set of clubs when we reserved our time. We waited approx 30 minutes for those to be delivered at our bay. The staff was apologetic and reset our time once the clubs arrived. Overall a good experience and I would definitely return.",

I am not sure why it appears you cannot reserve a bay at the LV location, there were plenty open and it seems it would only improve efficiency. I needed left handed clubs, which they asked about straight away, but they took a bit longer than I thought reasonable to show up. Our \"clock\" started and I think it was several minutes before I could take a swing. Not a big deal, but the rates aren't exactly dirt cheap and it is something that could be easy to pay attention to.  Service at the bay was excellent. Every person on the staff actually was really friendly and helpful.  Huge projector/TVs along the back showing sports (British Open this week), which was fantastic.  The technology and tracing is just really cool, and seems accurate at least comparing where I see the ball go to what they show on the screen. Games were fun and simple to run.  Clubs were just okay. But you are allowed to bring your own clubs if you like, and they were fine overall.  They did a good job spacing people out as the bays filled up, never felt crowded though I am sure on weekends and evenings the place is packed.  Overall, this is an awesome option to have basically on the Strip to mix up your LV experience. I could definitely even see people who do not golf going with a group and having a great time because of the atmosphere, food, and drink options.   Will be back for sure.",

I really like the system because it is very organized.  You pay per hour for golfing and it's organized on a screen, we've had 6-13 players each time, it's so fun! You just wave your club over the laser and the ball comes out, and you swing away. The points are then recorded and it shows you how far you have hit.  The food and drinks are great! I recommend the largest white sangria! It is enough for about 4-5 people to drink! It also comes in a cute souvineer cup that lights up with golf club straws! I have only had the chicken fingers which were 5/5, the wings 5/5, and the fish sliders (they sucked like 2/5) everything was priced perfectly and the service was great. Definitely my new favorite spot!",

The group had a great time and we had the best waitress and service team!  Bri Stiler was our waitress and she was extremely helpful and on point with everything! It is always difficult to plan for a big party of 16 and keep everything within budget, but everything went off without a glitch!  Thank you Bri for being the best waitress ever! I will ensure to ask for you as my server going forward!",

We went to this place because a friend recommended we watch the game here and it was one of the best decisions we made. Came here on a Tuesday afternoon and the customer service was on point, the food was great, the pool was great, and the overall experience was amazing. Everyone was helpful and professional and very attentive to the patrons. I love the fact that I did not see one employee on their phone and they cater to their customers. Wish they open a top golf in Los Angeles with the same high standards as this one. We will be returning on our next visit to vegas.",

Once you get to MGM, you have to walk inside for awhile to find it. But it's several levels, with each vestibule having its own table and golf accessories. It's pretty fun once you get the hang of it. You can either do strictly driving range or some type of points based system with targets (where you're just trying to hit targets, not long drive). Since it was a work event, there was a ton of free food and drinks. They had buffet style inside and the staff was always walking around taking drink orders (there was a bucket of beers waiting when you got to your station). They were also really accommodating if you had any questions or concerns. I'd definitely come back sometime (you even get some type of discount coupon when you initially sign up, which is free).",

We were a little confused on the levels as you enter on the second level so we had assumed that it was the first level. We accidentally chose the second level (thinking it was the 3rd, 21 and up, level) but I am glad we did because I am 99% sure there was a man walking around with two prostitutes or strippers on the third level interacting with guests. They didn't come over to us but the way they were putting their hands on other men, I probably would have been quite upset if they did that to my boyfriend! On a brighter note, the frozen red bull drink is freaking amazing so definitely try that out when you stop by!",

The wait staff were very friendly and accommodating, we ordered a bunch of different foods and everything was great: Chicken Nachos, Steak Nachos, Steak on a Stick, BBQ Wings, Hot Wings, and more.

If someone was to tell me 10 years ago that I'd be flying to Las Vegas for 30hrs to golf, I'd laugh at their face and go head to head with them on Jager shots. But here I am... picking up golf clubs and swinging at balls.   Why. Was. This. So. Much. Fun.  We came here around 2pm, waited 30-45 minutes to get our area. We upgraded to Level 3 (21 and up only - for $10 more). The price was decent, $75 an hour. Each game is 20 balls per person and you can play as many games you want within the hour. The place is open until 3am - i heard night time they spin music but can you really see where your golf balls are hitting?! Stick to day time if you are in it for the game.  THE ATMOSPHERE. Fancy! Nicest golf range I've seen. Mature crowd, people who ARE NOT twenty-one and sloppy with their liquor. Alot of people watching sports because they have a lounge area with cushioned seats as well as high tables with huge TV screens and a menu of (good) food. Three levels of golfing. Level 3 is the best with a bar upstairs too. There is a pool - reserved for private parties. When you get your reserved area for golfing you have your own private cushion seats and a server if you want to order food and drinks.  THE GOLFING. There are plenty different golf clubs to choose and use. For newbies who have a hard time hitting the damn ball, pick up THE BIG DOG clubs (the fat one). We got in about 2 games (40 balls) within the hour. First few rounds took some adjusting but you find your rhythm and start smacking balls left and right. Golfing doesn't sound that fun BUT BELIEVE ME, THIS WAS SUPER FUN. Note: be sure to click on your name prior to going up because you might be hitting someone else's balls. I wish the screen would automatically change for us.   THE FOOD. We should have ate lunch here instead of on the strip. We ordered a side of fries and dessert called the ADULT DONUT HOLES. It cost $15 but well worth it and a shareable item. Two small containers filled with donuts and two injectors. The reason they are \"adult\" is because the cremes are infused with alcohol and you sure can taste the alcohol. The two creme flavors in the injectors were Raspberry Jelly and Bavarian Cream.   So my future Vegas trips will consist of Food, Shows, Slots, and TOP GOLF.  JABA APPROVED. Until the next review...",

    "text": "I've been here a handful of times now and I love the experience!  There are four levels with multiple bars (and different themes; my favorite is the Riv Bar), two pools, games, TVs, and of course, golfing bays. It is a very fun environment and I encourage a tour of the facility before you indulge. There's a lot to take in!  I have been in bays on the second and third floors, always toward the center. The outdoor furniture, sectional and coffee table, is relatively comfortable. It's a little difficult to eat and there's not much room for a group to dine, but it's manageable. Clubs for men and women are provided with details for novices. If you're left-handed, they'll provide appropriate clubs upon request and place a tee on the other side of the green. Each bay is equipped with three screens, two for your game to keep track of everyone's plays and one with television. You also have a dedicated server for food and drink orders.  The bays have heating lamps for the colder months and they're very warm. As for the hotter times, I've seen comments stating that bays are air-conditioned, but I was there twice this summer and I don't think it exists (I guess it's probably there, but it's terrible). Also, we couldn't locate the temperature controls (nor were we told about them) and the misters do NOT help when it's in the triple digits. One particularly miserable visit was when it was over 100F and uncharacteristically humid at 11PM. We thought going in the evening would be easier, but it was almost unbearable. Pro tip: The bathrooms are heavily air-conditioned and the perfect place to cool off. Oh yeah, the pool closes at 9PM. Boo!  Prices vary a lot depending on floor, day, and time. Floors 1 & 2 is $30-75/hour and Floor 3 is $45-90/hour. Nevada locals receive 20% off bay rentals, so it's $24-60/hour and $36-75/hour. There's also a 10% discount for military, police, fire, and EMS personnel. The best time (based on price) to visit is Mon-Thurs, 9AM to 12PM. Note: It's six people per bay.  They offer valet (complimentary when I was there in July) and there is on-site parking, however, it's frequently unavailable due to events and conferences (you'll notice the large tent overwhelming the parking lot). Another option is parking at MGM Grand and catching the complimentary shuttle that runs every 15 minutes or walking over (approximately 5-7 minutes).  Food: The menu is constantly changing, paying particular attention to seasonal ingredients, so it's always exciting. However, I've had to say good-bye to some favorite eats (though there's a possibility of dishes returning with their respective seasons). My all-time favorite dish is the Burrata because it had the most delicious grilled bread and tomato jam (I'm hoping it'll make a comeback!!). I also like the 7-Layer Dip, Deviled Egg Sampler (the steak one is the best!), and Chicken Boursin Bacon Flatbread. The Heritage Turkey Meatballs on the Summer menu is fantastic as well. My family and I ordered the Texas-Style BBQ Platter ($110) and it was great. It had SO much food; I especially liked the hot links, brisket, and variety of pickles.  Cocktails: Their Frozen Mule and Summer Frose are really fun drinks and perfect for the heat. I liked the Pineapple Punch (Captain Morgan, Malibu, pineapple juice, and Monin Ginger), too. The latter is available in their souvenir golf bag mugs with club straws (super cute), 30 or 60 ounces ($20/$35).",

    "text": "4 gals had a few hours to kill between hotel check out and flight back to Reno.  Since we had golfers in the group we figured that Topgolf would be a great place to kill some time.  Unfortunately the golfers were not into hitting balls.   Bummer it looked like fun eventhough I'm the worst golfer in the world.  Each putting station had a box of clubs, an automatic golf ball dispenser with lounge seating.  The balls are shot into a large area with targets that light up at night.    There was plenty of thing to do in the other areas: Several bars. Sofas in front of mega-sized TV showing nothing but golf.  Tables for dinning. Swimming pools. Private meeting rooms.    We opted to hangout on the sofas and watch golf.   I just got an iced tea but there was a full bar.  Snacks were ordered: buffalo shrimp -- tender shrimp with a spicy sauce was the group favorite.  2nd favorite was the onion dip with home-made chips (not enough chips).  The pork sliders missed the mark and were dry.    I'd love to go back at night and hit some balls.",

The atmosphere is A+, whether you're a golfer or not it's a fun place to be. The wait was 45 minutes, but there's so much you can do in the building while you wait that time goes by quick. My friends and I just played ping pong, hung out at the bar, and watched the live band while we waited. We all had such a great time and will definitely be back here. The only thing is the food and drinks are very pricey. The price you pay for the golf is worth it, especially if you're splitting it with five other people. But my boyfriend paid $14 for a shot of Crown on the rocks and $13 for a beer. $27 for two drinks is pretty crazy so be advised if you plan to drink a lot.",

The only drawback is the location it a the back of the MGM and was a pretty decent walk to get there.

The pool and cabana is a nice touch but if you're seated next to a rambunctious group it may put you off. The third floor is limited to 21 y/o and older which is where we were last time. Food is pretty good and goes well with the beer and golf. I like the 7 layer dip and wings to share; then let the everyone choose one dish for variety. The games you can play make it fun and competitive. My main complaint this visit is that it took 30 minutes for the staff to get two members of our group left handed clubs. But definitely fun was had by all!!",

In other words...I had a blast on someone else's dime....:D  The service was top notch. They refilled our drinks before it was empty and they even showed me how to hold the golf club since I've haven't held one in over 20 years....Lol in other words, I really really suck. :) Empty plates and dirty napkins were cleared.... Silverware was replaced before I even missed them. Couldn't ask for better service. (5/5)  Fun (7/5)... Let me tell ya...I suck... And when I say I suck...I mean I really suck... But it was so much fun! Just hitting the ball... No matter where it ended up...I still had a blast. I might have sucked but the time you got to chat with the people that were \"golfing\" with your was great. And for me it was a great team building activity.  Overall, after checking out the prices I definitely want to come back on my own dime. It was well worth it. With the service being top notch and the fun I had... So worth it. I would recommend this to anyone. It doesn't matter if your are a golfer or not.... You will have fun! :) 2 thumbs up!!",

The place was packed on the Thursday night we visited; there was a 30 minute wait. It's a nice concept to apply technology to make hitting balls more social and entertaining. Friends with varying skill levels (even non playing) can now share & enjoy the experience together in a relaxing repurposed driving range environment. We got a private bay on the lower deck with comfortable seating and monitors that track ball carry, yardage, speed, hang time and height. We realized later the upper deck is better for you can see and aim at the colored targets better looking down. Four of us played for an hour: the tab came to $120 which included $60 for an hour plus 4 membership fees totally $20 and drinks and snack (the strawberry shortcake was moist and yummy). It was an easy walk back to our Hilton hotel on Harmon.",

    "text": "Fun place to check out in Las Vegas, and not far from the Strip.  Go for the beautiful Strip views alone!!    I have wanted to try Topgolf for a while now, and tried to go in KC one weekend only to find a 3 hour wait.  Figured it must be because it was a Holiday weekend evening, but I've come to find out that there must always be a wait time while at Topgolf.  5 of us went to the Vegas location on a weekday early afternoon.  First thing that stood out: FREE PARKING!!  I hope this continues, but we were prepared to paid since Topgolf is right next to MGM Hotel (and maybe owned by?!) and MGM now charges parking (BOOOO).  But there was a nice little parking lot with free parking.  I also noticed that they have shuttle service to and from MGM, so that was nice.    Inside- WOW.  It's a great mix of party atmosphere, relaxation, food, and entertainment.  We learned there was an hour and a half wait, and since we had nothing else to do we figured we would wait it out.  We went in to their lounge area where they had huge screens showing several sporting events and news.  From the lounge there is a bar, and the tables and couches (lounge feel) had menus on them.  However, even after sitting there for an hour, we never had a waiter/waitress come up to us to order.  For awhile we didn't even see wait staff, but after a while we saw them at other tables.  Not sure if it was because we already had drinks from the bar, but it was odd that no one checked in on us.  I loved this area though because they had some games off to the side (such as bags) to keep people occupied.   When your bay is ready, Topgolf texts you which is a nice features.  Payment isn't by person, but rather than bay, and up to 6 players can play at a given time.  Our bay was on the third level, which is more expensive, but still reasonable.  Wow, the view.  Can't say enough about it!  You can pay by the hour, and all money is collected at the end by a server who is assigned to your bay.  So if you decide to only do an hour but then are having so much fun you want to stay longer, you can.   There are at least 10 different games you can choose from.  We went with the most popular one, which is basically hitting the ball wherever and hoping it gets you some points.  We then switched over to a rookie level game where it tells you which color of hole to hit at.    We had a few problems with our bay. First, we would have balls that wouldn't be counted for points when clearly they went in to the hole.  I guess with all the balls being electronically equipped, we can't expect them to work all the time, so no biggie.  However, after the first game, somehow the computer lost one of our players and suddenly we had some guy we had never heard of playing on our screen.  It took several minutes to waive down our waitress to see how it could be fixed--she couldn't even fix it, so we just ended up playing with the name still there.  I had asked her to credit us 5 minutes since it had taken some of our time to try and fix this glitch, to which she agreed.  However, at the end, she told me she forgot to give us the extra time so instead subtracted our playing fee ($5 per person for a \"lifetime membership\") for a total of only $10--but this was still a happy result.   Pros: View, a place where you can get food and drinks (draft beers run about $7-$9), huge screens on the range so you can watch games while hitting golf balls, and a fun atmosphere to do something different.   Cons: Price is reasonable if you have 6 players--if it's only 2 people, it kind of sucks.  The glitch in the computer was annoying.  Definitely pay attention to what time you start.  I forgot to look, so had no idea if we truly got an hour or not.  Overall, fun hour to spend at a untypical golf range!",

There was a 2 1/2 hour wait, but bottom level was open. Bottom level is worthless. Can't see ball due to blinding screens in distance. Music is loud. Food nothing special. Assistant assigned to setting us up couldn't speak",

I don't understand how you can have 300 people at your event and have 100 parking spaces.  Not the best part of town to be walking from a casino parking structure to your destination. The Greek chicken was over cooked.   Bartenders redeemed a star by being fantastic.",

She just wanted me off the phone.. well I guess they got my money so they don't need to talk to customers any longer.. bad business",

They have 3 levels and a private deck and pool. Since we were there at night the pools were closed. I didn't see a huge difference in the 3rd and private deck. Also they pushed the 3rd deck is only 21 and over. From what I saw there were definitely kids wandering around the 3rd and 4th floors.   So we ordered a pitcher, which was expensive, after doing the math if we had just ordered beers we might have saved a couple of bucks. Then we ordered fries for 7 bucks. Which were the size of McDonald's medium fries, which was really small. We also got no plate so we mcguivered a way to dollop ketchup  The experience at topgolf is fun, hit as many balls as you want, they charge you on time not the balls hit.   Overall it's something fun to do if you like to golf, think upscale driving range, beers, and a great time.   The staff were great and very hospitable. They explained the game to us and the hostesses upstairs were really attentive.",

So the server (not the host) brought it directly to her and my other friend was livid, LIKE IT WAS SUPPOSE TO BE A SURPRISE AND THE LEAST THEY COULD HAVE DONE WAS PUT A CANDLE ON IT. Total facepalm.

    "text": "Definitely a fun thing to do in the area especially if you have kids. The wait is pretty ridiculous but you can make reservations. We came on a Saturday in the early evening with a party of 12. The first and second level are less expensive than the third level. The third level is for adults and require all participants to be over 21. We wanted to visit the first or second level given the price range and because we had underage individuals. We added our name to the wait-list and were given a 1-2 hour wait-time. Thankfully, they had another section on the second level that has cornhole, TVs, food and drinks, as well as plenty of comfy seating. We waited there for about 30 minutes and were then called for our reservations. I'm guessing most people don't like the wait-time and eventually bounce.  The actual experience was a lot of fun. The staff was great, super informative. The food was delicious. I got the Chicken, avocado, and jalapeno ranch flatbread for $14 which pretty damn good. Definitely, not spicy that's for sure. We also got the 7-layer dip and the inject-able donut holes both of which were fantastic but honestly how can you go wrong.    I would recommend it but I would highly suggest looking at the prices and discounts. We used a military discount which made the price seem much more reasonable. I know they do offer a discount for Las Vegas residents as well.   I mean I'd even go just to sit at the second level, order drinks and food, lounge on the comfy seating and watch the big screen.",

We met Tyler the Hospitality Sales Manager on Saturday and explained how we wanted to treat our friends to a round of golf., We explained that Sunday was a work day and our friends had a long drive back to California..  We agreed to pay the $100 an hour instead of $60 to avoid the 1 1/2 wait.. He also agreed he would wave the $250 food & beverage min.  We showed up and was told we would have to wait a 1/2 hour which we agreed to. At 8 pm we had another guy come over with the worst customer service and tell us he will make it $120 an hour and $150 min food and beverage because they are so busy the have people willing to spend $500. With customer service like that and Tyler no where to be found we were appalled at this behavior, we left. Pretty sad that they are all about the money and not at all about their customers.  They are taking adult fun and treating it like a Vegas night club, making you stand in line and /or buy your way in. Gorgeous place, horrible attitudes.",

It is a cool place to hang out, a little bit hot, because the golfing is outside. The food was good, drinks and golf was fun. The only negative is when you close your check they add the golfing to your food bill so you are tipping  on the golfing also. The golfing was $90 for 2 hours and our food and drink was $100 so the bill was $190. I think you should only have to tip on the service. So they are getting $20 extra for doing nothing. Tipped $40, but I think it should have only been $20 tip.",

Yes, an awesome host and made us feel really comfortable knowing we do not know anything about golf except to aim and hit. I got lucky and got a hole in one! Scored! One of the farthest targets too! Different games to choose from. Beginners to intermediate. They have heat lamps in the bays so no need to worry about being chilly ( vegas winter) since it's an open air venue. Had so much fun with the ladies. Food was amazing and so were the cocktails. Only downfall, valet filled up quickly so you will have to park at the MGM parking garage. Paid parking per hour and top golf cannot validate it to get free parking. Wise to just car pool together there to save a bit of money so everyone doesn't pay $7 or more per hour... It's just about a 5-10 minute walk so no heels ladies! Shouldn't be in heels anyways if you are planning to play. Just saying. Have fun!!!",

We then went back to the check in desk and let them know what we were told and after a few confused moments the head agent let them know the 3rd level was indeed available for the rental. Had a less than enthusiastic attendant take us up to our booth. Barely explained the games or process and left. The waitress took our 2 beer and one margarita drink order. Never asked anything else. Then as we paid our tab with minimal tip (based on the very sub par service) she asked us if 'that's it?' !! We explained that she didn't provide good service and our trip reflected so.

    "text": "I have to say that it's a great environment, the golf was a blast especially if you are with good people. Unfortunately the service was the worst that I have experienced. We were greeted right from the start and said we needed a moment to look at the menu. We never saw the server again until our time was up and they were asking if we wanted to add time. We got a second hour because the golf itself was fun. We then went to the bar to serve ourselves and then, and only then, our server shows up... I truly believe the server didn't care to serve us because they thought we were under 21 and it wasn't worth their time (which all of us were). As a server and with other industry people this scenario would have been ideal to serve... With five people and nearly the late night meal time both food and cocktails could have built a nice check. But seeing our server once every 55 minutes is a bit ridiculous. A 5 star venue and a 5 star experience but failed to serve its patrons.",

What was really great is that we got to choose between a putter and driver.   We had someone in our group who was left handed, and they accommodated for him-- so thoughtful!   They had a great selection of food and drinks. I ordered the Pina Colada and it was delicious! We also ordered Nachos and donut holes, which included various jellies and syringes that contain alcohol, so you could make yourself a small jelly donut!   The overall ambience of this place is great! There's something for everyone to do and was very inclusive. It takes place on a patio terrace area with shading so you can beat that Las Vegas heat if you're visiting during the summer. I would love to come here again in the future!",

We were informed that it would be about a 45min wait, and would be texted when our section was ready. Well, it was ready in like 10 mins! Pleasant surprise. Price wise, I think it lands on the $$$ side.   The service was fantastic though! Attentive & sweet server (forgot her name aweh). The drinks we ordered were pretty good - friend got a beer, I grabbed a spiked iced tea.  I've never played golf before, and this was definitely not easy lol. But a staff member named Kevin was super helpful & friendly. Would definitely return when I'm in Vegas next time!!",

It's so much fun to get your friends and family together to have some drinks, food, and fun! Even if you're not a golf expert or pro, I promise you'll still have so much fun laughing at one another lol   They even have heaters above your booth that will keep you warm in the winter that you can control yourself. The food was surprisingly very delicious! If you like tacos and Kalbi (short ribs) then you HAVE to get the Kalbi tacos! The quality of the meat is . It is pricy though just to give you a heads up. But they do give local discounts if you are a Vegas local. So other than the prices, this place is pretty fun and we definitely come often!!",

Several of us ordered skinny margaritas which kind of tasted like lime-water. Not sure what the other cocktails tasted like but I probably wouldn't go there to drink anyway.   They were pretty busy so requesting some drink refills & the bill were a bit delayed however, good customer service overall and a fun time!   We will definitely be returning to play again.",

Drink and food prices were steep but everything was yummy and service was excellent....from the person that got us set-up to our server! They had lots of different games you could play and were fun even for the  novice.

The concerts at this venue are a bonus so try to catch the band or a yoga class while there too. This place is full of surprises and at least inovative!!

The service was great and the drinks came quickly most of the evening. Occasionally the bar would get backed up and you'd have a little wait.   This was a fun evening, well worth the money!

You have your own stall/bay with a U shaped couch, coffee table, golf clubs & interactive screen. The food is like bar food, there's sliders, appetizers, cocktails, beer and etc. It's like if Dave n Busters, golfing & a nightclub had a baby.  I love how they make a driving range be interactive and game-like. There's a few challenges you can play against the people you are with in your bay.  Another thing we like is they have a whole area with a bar, huge projection screens, tables, couches, shuffle board and cornhole. So if you're done with the driving range, just hang out here!   The one thing i dislike is that it seems like it is close to the strip, but it's kind of not. You definitely have to Uber to get here, or you can walk through a rundown, questionable block.",

Came to celebrate my gal pals 30th and had bragged about the mimosas and my entire experience from my own visit... so now I am prepared for a different experience every time.  What I am thrilled about is the customer service of the staff here.  Have a ball every time  Clearly seeing my disappointment and knowing that I wanted to make my friends 30th something special they took it upon themselves to provide a birthday treat and surprised us both!  Love that they do the Sunday yoga every other weekend, nice touch of keeping it healthy and letting loose - especially in the warmer months.  Great to come with a group to explore more of the menu and keep costs down, but worth a couple trips for the experiences for sure.  Not sure this is really a kid kind of place, but I know they have different levels so maybe another level might be different then the pool and bar level.  Also not the kind of place to try to call a ton of times and get answers.  They are busy and not in the market of having someone in an office answering phones - although maybe not a bad idea to have a dedicated person... since we do get a lot of travelers from all over.  If you want to ask questions, better to stop by and take a quick tour to get your questions answered so you can see for yourself.",

    "text": "Topgolf is in a league of its own.  With Share-ride drop offs rigt in front and an ample amount of parking, this place is easy to get in and out of.  There are video poker and blackjack machines for those that want to get their gamble on.  There's endless amounts of big screen tvs for those that want to watch and root for their team or teams.  For those that want to eat or drink they've got that too all at reasonable prices.  Their donut holes, chicken wings and pizza are surprisingly delicious.  Portions are huge and meant to be shared.  So kepp this in mind.  For those that want to hit balls all day long, oh yeah, they've got that too!  With all sorts of promos for locals and tourists, it pays to join their membership club.  You can have an all day or all night type of fun without breaking the bank.  It's good for families but if you don't want to deal with kids, there's a level strictly dedicated to adults.  I had a great time and can't wait to get back.  Maybe I'll see you there.  Until then...  Cheers! Get your swing on!",

Being as we were a large group of 10, we made a reservation one month in advance. This allowed us to easily check in without having to stand in line. Because of our reservation, we were also guaranteed spots on the 3rd floor, a prime location for both newbies and seasoned golfers.  With our reservation, we had to order at least $600 worth of food & beverage, which is actually pretty hard to do, especially if you're hungover. What was great was that we were able to pack any of the leftover food we had.  My one star taken off was for one of the hostesses we had. She made a snide remark when we didn't really order alcohol (WE WERE HUNGOVER, OKAY), which made us all feel uncomfortable.  9/10 would recommend splurging but 10/10 would recommend making reservations in advance!",

We were placed on the 3rd floor which was a good height off the ground. Would definitely come back here to play again to practice my golf skills. Been telling the rest of my friends that live in the area that we need to go here it's a lot of fun!",

    "text": "When to top golf for the first time a few months ago with my husband and our friend who is a Vegas native. The golf was fun and the games were a blast. But my main issues have to deal with the customer service that we received.  Side note: our bartender that we dealt with in the second level was fantastic and the only reason why I didn't give one star. He was a blast, and was very attentive to us.   Getting back to the poor customer service on the Bay Area. The lady that took our order seemed to care less about our table but FAR MORE ATTENTIVE  to the group of young men behind us, and seemed to be flirting too. Which I would not mind if she ever brought us our drinks. We had to ask another waitress who was walking by to grab her and have her bring us our drinks. Finally they came, and they were delicious (hats off to the bartender!). After our game time expired we were still waiting for our check, and then another 10 minutes goes by and no sight of our waitress. We grab another waitress( who was amazingly sweet) to grab her or our check. She couldn't find her and just brought us our check for us! She was great and the bartenders!   Needless to say, not impressed, see no need to return, AND WE LOVE GOLF!",

The food that my gf's family had was huge and we had specialty drinks like vodka, cranberry, OJ, sky vodka and some bottles of Bud Light. The tacos were so good! We had like guacamole and that was the perfect blend, natural and stirred. Like you can taste the flavor and the spices. Top golf, you can get a range of golf sticks like short, medium or long and it can be MVP, long shots and short range shot for the golf balls each hoops of golf range, ranges by points, like if you shot inside the middle of the golf hoop, you would stacked more points and the most. We got these sugar filled donut holes and two syrups either chocolate and raspberry in these plastic syringes and you put it inside the donut holes, tastes very good! The only bad side is that the tacos and food would take a long time, waiting like 45 mins to 75 mins. The bartender lady was really nice and she kept asking us if we were fine and if we needed anything else. Overall, we stayed at Top Golf since like 3 PM all the way till 9 PM. Can't wait to go again!!",

The drinks are reasonably priced and food isn't half bad given the venue.

I am not a golfer, can barely hit the ball from a tee, but I can appreciate the fun in trying to whack the ball to a target on the grass. I decided to take my 2 sons (pre teens) here to do something a little different in LV.    The facility is clean, large, well maintained, and stocked with great amenities.  The service is stellar and the food was surprisingly delicious. I was happy that the clubs and equipment were in good shape.   We came just prior to noon, and of course, missed the AM pricing by 5 minutes- though that's my fault for not being more organized.  I'd advise you bring a small group to get the best bang for your buck.  There were 3 of us and paying  $20/person + mandatory membership fee (why?  I don't even even live in NV.  Just another way to get $ for them.) seemed steep for an hour of swinging at air.  Add in food and drinks, we left paying well over $125 for the hour.  We enjoyed ourselves and it was something different, but I wouldn't return if I was back visiting LV.  Simply too pricey.",

Its been a while since I've went to a driving range but didn't know that Topgolf was going to be so different than my expectations. Topgolf for golf as Lucky strike is for bowling.  A pay by the hour lounge for you and your friends to play golf in which you hit the balls for score. Food was good, drinks were great, and the concept of a scoring driving range is brilliant. Our hostess did a great job explaining everything to us as it was our first time and she helped us with time management since I felt we were going to surpass our 1hr playing time.   After golf, we were escorted to their lounge to hang out to finish our food and drinks. Within their lounge were some corn holes, and that became another set of fun for our group. (for free =) )  VERDICT: Rinse and repeat.",

    "text": "this is a review of this particular Top Golf as I've been to a few and the other ones are better as far as service at the bar goes. I sat down to wait for my friends meeting up from out of town and was at the bar for about 5mins before anyone even acknowledged me, no \"I'll be right with\" or nothing. I was about ready to walk away when one of the 3 bartenders finally asked if I needed a drink. Having dated 3 bartenders I know that this was plain bullshit. After getting our stall and having a waitress come to take our orders it was ok. Waiting at a 1/4 filled bar for service while looking at 3 bartenders walk right past you is not good business. Thank you to the pregnant waitress who was very good to us. We ended up spending about $500 between the 6 of us my tab alone being almost $200 cause of all the shots I was buying for everyone. I'd much rather find another place to spend my money next time if they are just going to ignore me like that at the bar. As far as golfing is concerned, it is on the high side to hit balls but still fun. For some reason we had top floor reservations but when we got there they said there were no open stalls, only while we were waiting and drinking on the top floor there were about 4 stalls open, another little red flag... oh well now I know.",

It was 60 bucks for our pit for the hour, we ordered drinks, appetizers and lunch. The drinks were decently priced for Vegas.  We had the edamame and hot wings for an appetizer and margarita flatbread for lunch. Everything was so yummy!  Great service from our waitress and all of the staff.  It has its own uber pickup location so it's easy to get to.  I definitely recommend stopping here on your vacation! So fun!",

    "text": "We were so excited to check this place out, but left kinda disappointed in the whole experience.   We tried to make reservations ahead of time, but could not get through to someone on the phone when we called. We arrived at 7ish and decided on a 3rd floor bay- $75 plus a ridiculous $5 membership fee per person. The price list when you arrived stated all the \"walk-in\" pricing. So, I informed the woman who was taking our reservation that we tried to call ahead, blah blah blah and I was frustrated that now we were stuck paying walk - in pricing. She explained that Top Golf does not accept reservations and the \"walk-in pricing\" is their only price. Then why not just call it the price....  But whatever, we decided to play and have some fun. My father-in-law was assured that all clubs, balls and gloves would be available to us in our bay, included in the fee. He was pleased because he did not have his gloves with him.   After you make your reservation you wait for a host to take you to your bay. The place is beautiful, brand new and the bars on the 3rd floor were awesome. We got to the bay and the hostess proceeded to speak so fast that we had trouble figuring everything out. I was with my husband and in-laws, and the music was so loud that they could not hear her explanations. Getting set up on the computer system was another annoyance. Again, it was loud and we are all huddling around a small computer to give our personal information. Seemed very inefficient.   Finally, we got set up on the computer and were ready to play. But no gloves - the host explained that gloves could be purchased at the store for $15 a pair. Wtf. We were told not even 10 minutes earlier that they were included.....   Then, our server came to give us the whole menu schpiel and ask for a credit card to keep the tab open. We only played for a hr because of the expense and she must have come to our bay more than half a dozen times asking if we wanted food/drinks. Her interruptions took away from our hour of play and it began to get very annoying! There should be a call button for bar service. I don't need someone babysitting me.  $100 poorer and an hour later, we left. It was a fun experience once we figured out the games, but the service and the organization leaves a lot to be desired. In a place like Vegas where service is everything, this place is lacking.",

    "text": "Having been to Topgolf at this location over the last few years and had a great time I was initially very disappointed with our visit.  We were told our wait with no reservation would be 45 minutes which wasn't bad but when that turned into an hour n a half we were more than a little disappointed. Each time we went to the front desk we were told only 10 more minutes by the same customer service rep. Finally after the hour and a half we called it quits. I asked to speak to a manager and was referred to the end of the counter where having explained the entire experience I was told she wasn't the manager after all but that our bay was ready.  Our group of 6 was done and just wanted to leave. I again asked for a manager and was introduced to Janelle Reynosa. She was amazing to say the least. I just wanted to speak with her about how the breakdown occurred and that she should be aware of it. Our group was not looking for compensation of any kind and nobody was going away angry just sad we didn't get to have fun with our family at top golf. Janelle was honest about having a special event going on ( which the front desk should have mentioned upon our arrival) she apologized for the confusion and extended wait time (which we would have completely understood had we been advised since we didn't have a prior  reservation).  At any rate she offered 2 hours of complimentary play at a later date of our choosing which was a wonderful gesture.  Top golf is lucky to have employees such as Ms Reynoso she really turned a bad experience into something very positive.",

    "text": "If you are a good golfer and like competition amongst friends then this is a very fun place to go to on occasion if you have the money to spend since it's quite pricey for such a limited number of range balls per person. You're paying the premium for a very well-staffed business and the very cool scoring system so as long as you know this and aren't expecting to hit anywhere near a bucket of balls per hour you'll have a lot of fun. There are LOTS of very friendly and helpful employees all around the facility that cater to making your visit perfect. The greeters outside give you an overview of the facility, carry your gold club bag inside, offer and explain the playing options and prices, help you check in, show you to your range slot location, show you how to use the scoring system, and allow you to order food/drinks because every range slot has a table that seats at least 4 people as well as rental clubs which are included if you don't have your clubs with you! The scoring system not only tracks each person's ball speed and flight path, it also knows exactly which part of each target they hit every ball in and keeps perfect score based on how close to the center you hit. I went with a group of 5 and we each hit 20 balls in our 1hr session. It's easy to find a staff member at all times to get help or ask questions so it feels like when I stay at a high-end hotel in a $5000+ suite which was a very nice surprise the first time I went there when they just opened as I was only expecting the normal golf course type amenities and basic service. I've made it a point to go back there each time I'm in town (approx once a year) and amazingly the level of service has remained just as great! I'd like to compliment all the employees there for their continually excellent service because I greatly appreciate that level of professionalism, courtesy and dedication which is why I enjoy playing there every time I'm in town. Thank you!",

They offer a \"Veteran's Discount\" and claim when you reserve your bay that they have applied it to your bay. We had a Veteran in our group, so that made us happy. But then when our bill came, they had removed our Veteran's Discount. No explanation ever given. Just a bait and switch, I guess.  Third, we ordered food. When I asked several times where some of our food was, they kept assuring us it was on the way. 30 minutes later...\"oh, ma'am, we forgot to put in your food order, we just did it now...sorry.\" Which is fine. Things happen. People are human. Not the end of the world. You know what they did to make it up to us? Nothing. None of the food comped to make up for it being 50 minutes late. Not even a glass of beer comped as a sorry. Just food that showed up 50 minutes after we ordered it.  Great service, there, folks.   Hot, sweaty, and untrustworthy servers. What more can I say?",

The food was amazing we ordered all the platters and the drinks were super good even the mixed drinks you could definitely tell they put the right amount of alcohol. The golfing was fun even though I suck at it and was drunk it was so much fun lol. Not sure how much this place runs but our bill was at least 1300.

Time flew because there are tv's and a lively bar atmosphere.   The structure of the building is new and you can tell with its beautiful light fixtures. After our drunken round of golf, we headed to the Pro Shop. The store itself was super clean and organized. We were assisted by this little red headed girl, Malia? She was able to provide extensive knowledge of the products and great customer service. Although we went in to window shop (and sober up), we ended up buying a couple items.

    "text": "Be prepared to be treated like an ATM and disrespected.  This place should have been great. It's an awesome idea and the facility is set up perfect. Unfortunately my experience was terrible.   This is not a cheap experience and for the $600 I spent to take my 6-8 (some people came and went) friends out for 2 hours I was extremely disappointed.  I'm not even going to go into how terrible the follow through was trying to get a quote and reservation.   From the moment we arrived there was confusion about how the time was started and we received almost no instruction on the system. This was not a problem it's pretty intuitive but a few hints would have been nice. For instance once a ball is dispensed you can still change player on the screen, but that previous ball is still logged to the prior player.   The food and drink minimum policy is ridiculous.  Form the minute we got there we were under pressure to order. Although I wanted to get rounds of beer going I was pressured to order shots because as I was told beer would not cost enough. As soon as we placed food orders and it arrived we were pressured to order more and more shots. I finally got pissed when I realized that after 40 minutes I had spent more time trying to order and deal with the staff than my friends. I asked what the hell all the pressure was for?  I had assumed we could just finish our tab when we got off the lane. Management told me this is not possible, and as soon as our time was up we would be charged and we would be out of time to eat and drink our minimum.  Would could not order anything else without being charge additional.  In the middle of all of this a staff member we had not seen before came over and turned off our lane and said we were over our time limit. We had somewhere around a 1/2 hour left.  My friends and I were already feeling uncomfortable and this sucked the energy right out of the group. Everyone already had their things gathered up before I could get the manager to figure out what was going on and turn our bay back on. Also the way this individual walked up and spoke to my wife with disrespect made me extremely mad.  We were not credited back this lost time at the end nor apologized to.  At the end of 2 hours we still had not reached out minimum, I had done very little golfing and I had to take a bag of 10 or so full beers in order to reach our required expenditure. We made lots of fun with our beer bags as the night went on but were made to feel like a joke walking out with a bag of beer at the time.  If your dedicated to try top golf in Vegas, know that the required food and drink ingestion conflicts with the ability to actually engage in the event. You will have a limited time to make this happen that leaves you almost no time to waste while ordering and dealing with the staff.  We came ready to spend, eat and drink and could not complete the mission. By the middle of out time I was aggravated and feeling disrespected from all the pressures.  I was not treated as a guest nor hosted with respect while we were there.  I did not intend for any of my friends to know how much this cost or to care about the money.  Unfortunately it was the main focus of our host and everyone was made to feel very uncomfortable about it. This made ordering more difficult and I was very upset.  You can find a way better venue to host your friends for $600. Good luck!",

The bays have couches and heaters, and they play music and have TVs going. You can even make your sports bets there.

This was my third time coming here and couldn't believe we waited to be seated in a booth on a Saturday night when 2 floors had more than half of their booths open!!! There is a crazy long wait and all these booths open with staff walking around everywhere!!! They told us we had to wait because they reserved some seating but we were paying customers... Willing to pay the price to have a good time! They told us the first two times coming that they didn't do reservations and that it was first come first serve. Well we are here now on a Saturday and it's dead at the booths and we are waiting. Not coming back!! And I'm a local and active duty military. No love...",

I enjoyed myself as well . Our server was very attentive , refilling our ice water . We didn't order anything from the menu because we had just had brunch but some items on the menu did sound appetizing . It can be pricey depending what time you go and there is a third floor or top floor that caters to a younger group . Families usually use the bays on the 1st and 2nd floor . We will definitely visit again . My only grip is a $5 membership fee per person and since we are a family of 6 that added an extra $30 to our bill . Just seemed unnecessary. But I'm still giving 5 stars . I do hope they continue the great service and welcoming faces.",

The facility has many games to play like corn hole, skeeball, and even pools in the uppers levels. The wait staff is extremely accommodating. They have clubs for juniors and women's.

They were really nice in explaining all of the cost and details.  For Saturday, during the day, you can book a bay with can accommodate 8-10 people (only 6 can play at a time).  They charged $100 /hour (2 hrs is the limit) and then a F&B of $375.  This does not include service and gratuity.  If you wanted it in the evening, the hourly increases to $125 and the F&B is over $400.  This may sound like a lot, but is the best way to bypass the line to get in.  Apparently it is not unusual to wait 2-4 hrs to come here.  We came at 2:30pm, still somewhat hungover from the previous night.  We tried our best to order food and drinks (mostly beers and red bulls) and had a difficult time meeting our minimum during the 2 hours.  We ended up asking for a bag and took like 8-10 cans of beers and redbulls home with us. So this is a somewhat pricey option to entertain yourself in Vegas during the day.  We did have fun so I can't complain too much about the price.  overall bill was $680 for 8 people for 2 hrs...",

    "text": "After experiencing Topgolf during their pre-opening media event with fellow Yelp Elite members, I knew I had to check it out again soon.  'Soon' ended up being opening night!  I gathered a few friends and we made our way to the newest and coolest spot to grace our city.  Not everything went as smooth this time around.  The check-in process was difficult.  Entering our info into the machines to get memberships and play wasn't working and a manager had to restart it.   We played for about an hour and a half.    The games were fun and I'd suggest playing top chip rules.     We ordered favorite foods from the Yelp event.  The shrimp, the steak skewers, and chicken wings.   They forgot all the dipping sauces for the chicken which took 20 more min to arrive.   Otherwise delicious.   When we finished, closing out our tab was sadly worse than starting the game.  The machine wouldn't end the game properly, our server was missing for help and eventually we found another manager.   We arrived at 630pm played 1 1/2 hour of golf, how did we leave after 9pm???  Lots of waiting.  Thankfully a manager comped our games and most of our food.    That is excellent service and that is how you retain customers.   Thank you Hollie.   I'm all for giving this place the five stars it deserves and hopefully their staff and their machines in the bay improve as time goes on.  I definitely can't wait to host more friends and coworkers here in the future.     Yelp 100 Challenge 2016 - 28 / 100",

    "text": "Topgolf. Is. Spectacular.  I went to a soft opening last Friday and the venue completely exceeded my expectations. Las Vegas has nothing like this and it's going to be such an amazing addition on the strip.  Topgolf is spacious - 4 floors with everything imaginable! There's 5 different bars, 2 pools, live music, delicious food, and of course - golfing. A very unique type of golfing:  - You reserve a hitting bay which has a booth with plenty of seating (can lounge and order food/drinks here if you're not much of a golfer) - Those who want to play hit golf balls on the hitting bay towards a large, open field with multiple targets - You earn points depending on where your golf ball lands; various targets on the field, closer to the bullseye (flags) and the farther you hit in distance earns you more points - A microchip is in every golf ball so the score is sent virtually to a screen located in your hitting bay  The top 2 floors are for 21+, however, the overall atmosphere of Topgolf is great for all ages. Kids, teens, and adults can all enjoy themselves at Topgolf! This would be an excellent choice for a family outing - and with the great bars, food, and live music, I definitely can see young adults enjoying a birthday or bachelor/bachelorette party here. Oh and of course, I know locals like myself will thoroughly enjoy Topgolf... Especially those who enjoy golfing and drinking!   The service here is the cherry on top. All of the workers, servers, and bartenders were incredibly welcoming, friendly, and attentive during the soft opening. I can't wait for Topgolf to officially open. I was so impressed with everything about this place and have nothing but positive things to say. I can't wait to come back!",

You can't make reservations and when we first got there they told us it would be a 2 hour wait. We decided that we should maybe go eat and then come back but when we asked again they said we were next. Not sure how that worked out but it did! We had around 12-13 people with us and I'm not sure what the biggest space is but we couldn't all fit in the booth we got so some of us had to stand or sit in the outer area. The game also only lets you put in 6 names at a time so we just ended up taking turns on anybody's name. It made it harder to keep score.  I want to say that it's really hard if you've never swung a golf club before. I had 3 people teaching me how to stand and swing and it still felt super awkward.   Overall though it's a nice place to hang out and the food isn't bad either.",

Vegas is different though.  Fast forward to this past long weekend in Vegas. I had no time to play a full round of 18 with my Vegas buddy, so I decided to take my golf clubs anyways to check out Topgolf Vegas (just opened last week). 1st floor is the cheapest rate, as you go higher, the rates per hour goes up. They have 4 floors but the 4th floor has a pool and is only  used for private groups and parties. You also wait longer as you go higher up the floor. We waited about 30 minutes, Sunday night for the 1st floor.   I love the concept but it's NOT cheap and will put a nice dent in your wallet. However, if you go with a party of 10 versus a party of 2, you can split the cost amongst your friends. They charge you by the time you spend in the stall. Our bill for my buddy and I with alcohol and 1.5 hours of play was about $140. Ouch. I highly recommend you go with a bigger group.   As a golfer, you don't really need your own golf clubs (my buddy and I brought our own clubs). Clubs are free to use there for each stall. Waiter service...our waitress Alexis from the Bronx was amazinggggg! She was super attentive and stopped by and chatted with us and her other stalls tons of times. She was well versed in the Topgolf games and recommended what she liked and knew how to run those darn computers for us! A+ Alexis...if you or a Topgolf manager reads this kudos to you!   Liked the concept, didn't like the wait times (even with stalls open). Pretty expensive unless you bring a bigger group to split the cost. Thanks to Alexis and the two Asian girls from LA in stall 103 Sunday night for entertaining us this past Sunday night! Great times in Vegas! :))",

Then we had to walk about a half mile to get to Topgolf. Yes, they have a shuttle and offer Lyft credits, but those are not feasible options when you have an infant/children who need car seats. I ONLY planned this because we could park on site, for free. Well, we schlepped from MGM in the heat. They did give us a $10 off coupon for the parking debacle; however, it wasn't combinable with the local discount. So I paid $9 extra for tourist prices, wiping out the \"free parking.\" At the very least, post a calendar on the site to tell people when the parking lot will be blocked off.",

The bottom two floors have no age limit and have fun games out to play.   They don't take reservations, so you have to wait about an hour for your golf bay. Not to worry, there's so much to do to pass the time, it goes by quickly. All four floors have their own bars, large TV screens everywhere, and either a live band or a DJ.  The bay's hold up to 10 people, but only 6 people per bay can actually play golf. For $5 you get a lifetime membership card. But then you pay by the hour which is a different price depending on the time of day and the day of the week.   The uniforms for the staff are really cute plaid shorts, so they are easily recognizable. The security wears red polo shirts. Our bay server, April, found my cell phone and turned it into Buck, who was happy to return it me, when I unlocked it to prove it was mine! Thank you, thank you, thank you! We'll be back every single time we have visitors in from out of town! This is our new go-to place for celebrations!",

So yes, they are kid friendly levels 1 through 2. Level 4 is reserved for events/big parties, you could call to reserve it or do it online. Level 1 is downstairs and level 2 is on the first level of the building once you enter. They have a full bar on the main level with their own topgolf drinks! You can get a 30oz or 60oz in a topgolf cup. The 60oz lights up and comes with golf club straws. No lid comes with it so  be careful not to spill! Their crispy shrimp was yummy. But to be honest, the crispy outer layer is what made it good, they shrimp was small and could be fresher. I personally wasn't a fan of the 7 layer dip. It comes with frozen cheese on top. And the mango habanero wings, if you've had mango habanero wings from buffalo wild wings, then it does not compare. They just be more flavorful and have more of a spicy kick to it.",

    "text": "As a Vegas local, I honestly have no desire to visit the Strip or anywhere in the area at all, however, I have been dying to check out Topgolf since the location first opened last spring! I've heard a lot of great things about this place and decided that it would be fun to take my cousins here while they were visiting from LA this past weekend.  We arrived at Topgolf late Saturday night and as we were walking toward the stairs to the entrance, the valet attendant quoted us with a wait time of about two hours, more or less. I was a little shocked, but it was a Saturday night and I should've known that was expected. We decided to go in anyway and put our names down on the list and wait for a bay to open. If you don't feel like waiting, I would definitely recommend that you plan ahead and call to make a reservation for your party!  As soon as we walked in, I was immediately impressed. The atmosphere is amazing! Bright and colorful lighting, the current EDM and pop hits playing in the background... Topgolf will definitely give you a little taste of the Vegas nightlife without having to go to a nightclub! While waiting for our text to let us know that our bay was ready, we lounged on the couches in front of the big screens, played Cornhole, and enjoyed a few drinks from one of the five bars. The drinks were decently priced compared to anything you'd order in a nightclub on the Strip, so I'm definitely not complaining.  Once we received our text, we were lead to our bay on the second floor by David. The bays are nice and cozy and are also climate controlled, so you can adjust it as needed. David explained how to use the screen and how there were different games to play. We opted for the basic high scoring game. He registered all of us in the system and we began to play right away! We definitely enjoyed ourselves while playing. Majority of the time, we were just laughing at each other and how terrible the next person's swing was. Nuyen was our server for the night and she took really good care of us. She was so patient with us when we were having technical difficulties with our screen and even comped us some time to make up for it! The customer service at Topgolf is definitely there.  Overall, I really enjoyed my first experience at Topgolf and I know my family did too. The prices are reasonable, the views from the bay are beautiful, and did I mention that they offer a discount for locals? Score! I'm definitely looking forward to my next visit!  Tip: To tourists, the advertisement may be a little misleading because there is a large sign outside of the MGM hotel saying that Topgolf is located at MGM, when it is actually located on a street parallel to the Strip.",

Combined all of that with nice air conditioning in the dry desert heat, and you may not want to leave.  You get a lot of turns to hit the ball. Just wave the club over the sensor and new golf balls will pop out. Then, just hit into the open range. It's actually really hard; you need lots of power to get it on the green. The view is so nice; you can see the Vegas hotels and the linq ferris wheel.  It's one of the most popular attractions in Vegas now. Been to another topgolf in the US, and this one was definitely better.  Upstairs are table games and a really good DJ, the day we went. Jump in the pool when you get tired of golf.  Go earlier in the day for cheaper prices and fewer lines. The higher level you go, the more expensive it is. There's also a gift shop.",

So we all got to rotate. We did level 3 and the highest was level 4. Of course dress casual to be comfortable. The place looks clean, new, and a had a club/lounge feel with their bars and entertainment service, it felt like Vegas!   It was not in any hotel, just located off the strip. The closest hotel looks like MGM.",

I'm not even a golfer and I had fun too.   Getting to Top Golf was super easy. The group I was with took the monorail, which dropped us off at the MGM and then we took a 10-minute walk from the casino.   For a Wednesday night, it was rather busy. The backdrop of the Las Vegas strip while you are golfing is a nice addition too.",

Very clean facility and a must do when in Vegas. Nice to get away from strip casinos. The pitchers of beer took a while to get to the table and definitely don't go there trying to play for anything  less than 1hr. They waste up to 15 mins of playing with explaining how to use the software when they could do that before your time starts. We ended up playing one game for an hour then decided to do another hour after that. All players were required to purchase a membership of $5 each on top of the rental of the hitting bay. Overall recommend and family already planning to go back next time in Vegas, kid friendly, nice staff, and fun experience.",

    "text": "We LOVE TopGolf and will go any time we have the opportunity to.  We were soooo excited that we finally had the chance to stop by their flagship venue in Las Vegas.    It was a little after noon when we arrived on a Saturday.  By then, they were packed!  There was an hour's wait for a bay so we decided to go get some lunch in the meantime.  We walked into the dining area on the first level and found a seat right by the bar area, where the bartenders enter and exit the bar.  At that time, the dining area was pretty open and they were not too busy.  We found a seat and waited for someone to come over to take our order.  And waited.... And waited...    In the meantime, two larger parties arrived after us and were seated further across the room, against the wall and by the stage.  IMMEDIATELY, the wait staff gravitated over to them and started taking their drink orders.  I guess a big crowd equals big money.....  So while they started receiving their beverages and their orders were being taken, we were still waiting.  We finally went over to a manager at the bar who said they would send someone over, but it took about five minutes.  There were plenty of servers that walked by us or were standing around, that were not busy.  After a few minutes, the manager came over and took the order himself.  It took some time for the beverages to arrive, and then it took a while longer for our meals to arrive.  We also had to ask for settings.  By that time, we were there for well over a good half hour from the time we took our seats.  There was room on the table next to us, so another party of five arrived and sat down.  We warned them that service was slow.  Sure enough, they experienced the same problem.  They finally sent a member of their party over to the bar to have their beverage orders taken.  It took a while for their drinks to arrive.  They were looking over the menu and were ready to order.  The problem is that no one came by to take their order!  After about 15 minutes, they just got up and walked out.  Are we surprised?  Well, yes and no: for a flagship location to operate like that - yes; for guests to walk out after being totally ignored - no.  We have seen waaay busier mom and pop restaurants operate better than that!!!  Our bay finally became available, so we were trying to close out our bill.  That transaction took another 15 minutes to complete as we had to wave down yet another manager who asked someone else to come over.  They never came and the manager ended up closing it out himself.  We have never had such a disappointing dining experience at Top Golf!  We can't imagine how service is like when they ARE busy!!!  There was absolutely nothing about that service that made me even think that I was in their premier flagship venue.  As for the game play itself, it was fun.  Top Golf is a total experience.  I don't mind spending so much on a meal there if the service was even decent.  We have visited other Top Golf locations and have had fantastic service.  Would I go back to the LV TopGolf?  Probably not - not for that price point and the service failures.  We'll save our hard earned money and spend it at the smaller venues instead.",

In the bay, you can have 6x people max. Also, if you are a first timer, they will charge you $5 to start a new membership with them.  Come at night because the golfing range will light up. So pretty but it's also more expensive at night than in the morning/afternoon.   If you suck at golf, this will be a place to showcase your nonexistent skills.

What a great concept this is and loving the game as I do it was a must to stop here and a nice break from the casino environment. Prices were a bit high, $60 an hour but if there was a group of people the cost could be broken up.  The location was close to the strip, right behind the MGM and easy to get to. There was a swimming pool here and you could make sports bets too!  My first impression was how clean it was and enthusiastic the staff was. We got there midafternoon and it was pretty busy but what place isn't busy in Las Vegas on a Friday afternoon! There were 3 levels of bays where you could hit balls into a fairway with a view of the strip. Apparently at night everything is lit up with music blaring....sounds like so much fun I can't wait to come back and try it out.  We opted to hang out in the bar area where the Ryder Cup was airing on the largest TV and order appetizers. The spicy shrimp was really good as well as potato chips served with onion dip in small mason jars. Pulled pork sliders were also ordered but not too impressive.",

So now we missed the time and price went up another $15.  WTF???!!  This is why people make reservations.  Pricing is confusing as we weren't sure if it was price per hour or price per person per hour. Haha.   Aside from all that hullabaloo, the place is pretty cool.  There's a bar and sportsbook in the waiting area as well as 2 GIANT tv screens to view the games.  All in all, it was an awesome time!! Staff was fun and friendly and drinks were fairly priced.

After waiting well beyond the time given my boyfriend went to see how much longer it would take, and come to find out my name was no longer there!  They couldn't find me in the system.  They quickly accommodated us and sent us off along with our server.  It was only two of us and an hour went by so quickly that I can't imagine a large group getting much play time in one hour and it can get pretty expensive after that.

We ordered the shrimp with the shredded apples on top and that was also incredible! The hot wings were so good too, there were mild and I was able to enjoy them. We ordered dessert, the injectable donut holes. We all agreed that the raspberry injections were the best!   We initially bought 1 and a half hours of golf but were comped 30 mins because the wait was crazy long that night, so it was 2 hours we got to play. Time went by so fast, we had so much fun!!!! This place was definitely a hit in our books and we would for sure come back!!!",

    "text": "Absolutely love this place.... fun for adults, for for kids. Wish there was one in SoCal, I would go all of the time!!!! They have a very easy check in process. No need to bring clubs (but you can if you'd like to). I think like 16 different golf games to play in your assigned section. Booze. Helpful staff. Sports playing on TV. A POOL. At night sometimes a DJ. Did I mention BOOZE! This place is so much fun and really it doesn't matter if you're trying to go pro or just trying to hit a golf ball into ANY of the playing fields, you're going to have a great time. Food there is less than stellar so go with a full belly or just expect to eat like bowling alley food... overall I highly recommend going here and just doing something fun and inclusive with other peeps. TopGolf please bring us some options to Claremont, CA!!!!!",

You would think that they would have invested in mist on all bases (balconies where you play from) but they didn't. Also the service at least from the agent that takes you to the bay was not good, we asked her if the time had started and she said it had but we where wasting our time \"asking too many questions...\". Coming from an industry of excellence in service this was the worst welcome I've had in Vegas. I would go back in October tho",

I looked on the website, which was confusing as far as how to book, the cost, what is included etc. Since I couldn't figure it out from the website,  I called multiple times Thursday - Sunday to ask some questions and make an appointment if possible, and no one ever answered the phone. I left three separate voicemails over the course of the weekend, and it has now been almost been a week and I still have yet to hear anything back. I ended up not being able to ever get through, so I gave up and we didn't go. What kind of business doesn't respond to voicemails? It looks like this place is pretty big, and they charge quite a bit to play golf. You would think that they could afford to pay more than one employee.",

No, the parking is not super convenient, however, some walking when on the strip should be expected, and it IS Vegas... it's hot here. When we got there around 930 on a Saturday night we were informed there would be an hour wait for a bay so we put our name in and went to one of the many bars inside the facility. Great service and good drinks. Our bay was ready earlier than 1 hour and once in the bay we had an awesome time! The guy who showed us to our bay was very friendly and knowledgeable and our server was on top of our drink situation the whole 3 hours we were there. We ordered the BBQ platter and the food was delicious and plenty for all 6 of us to share. Let's not forget the main attraction, the golf! So fun competing in the games against everyone and great club options to use. Bonus points locals get 20% off, so for a locals night out definitely 5 stars!",

I'm a big fan of the rock shrimp and steak skewers!!! Drinks on the other hand, are made poorly and watered down. Riding a classic drink like a Manhattan would be a mistake here. I place the blame on the ice, it's so thin that it dilutes quickly and changes the elements of the cocktail. I was even given samples of their sangria (white and red) and although it wasn't horrible, it was great either. The samples were straight up. The pitcher came out with bundles of ice and bar fruit, when I expected seasonal fruit. The ice completely changed a sangria that was already not the best, to one of the worst. The pitcher was also suppose to come with souvenir cups that were never received. Basically, if you still with a straight shot or beer, you'll be satisfied. If you need a cocktail, opt for a simple one, like a mule or rum and coke.",

Ask the tourists that lined up to enter. The dinner party at TopGolf had excellent dishes with great customer service, especially on a hot summer day. The service amazing. I had to return, especially to experience TopGolf at night. The most amazing thing was the air conditioners outside, we all stayed extremely comfortable. I felt hotter in my car with the air conditioner on high than outside on the platform at TopGolf. The parking lot was packed. Tourists visiting had to take a shuttle bus to the MGM Grand, but that was right next to the swimming pool. The food was as good as the customer service. The hosts really took care of us to make sure plenty of food was served. Earlier I was at Planet Hollywood down the street. I raise that point, because tourists playing at TopGolf were engaged, excited, having fun, enjoying themselves, whereas visitors at Planet Hollywood looked exhausted, walking in circles, shopping as if they were shopping at a shopping mall back home; Whereas TopGolf was like playing golf in a Hollywood movie on another planet, especially with the nighttime skyline with the ring of the Linq, towers and resort casinos. Plenty of television sets to keep up with the sports on TV. Refreshing, fun, delicious appetizers, plenty of beer, gorgeous cocktail waitresses, levels of amusement.",

Before any negative comments I do want to say how friendly and helpful the staff was. BUT when we got there they said it would be a short wait, which was fine since we could sit at the inside bar and cool off and have a drink, good service, good bar tender. Then we got the call that our stall was ready and we went through the tutorial and then the machine started to malfunction, and they told us it was because they were expecting a corporate event and the computers were locking the system. They politely asked us to sit in a lounge area while they tried to fix the issue. Fast forward, an hour later, we're still waiting so we decide enough is enough we want to cash out pay for our food and drinks (which were good) and leave. The manager refunded the golfing sick we didn't golf and comped the food which was more than necessary but appreciated. THEN on our next trip we were approached by someone working for Top golf in the MGM and told them the story, he made contact with his manager so we could have a \"do-over\" with a discount, we were on board and waited for the management to contact us but they never did. Maybe another corporate event had him busy. If you can golf it looks like fun but it didn't work for us.",

Then before getting kicked out, I met the manager....who did nothing to resolve the issue but said i can play here and he gave me his business card. Wow.

When they saw the cake they told us we couldn't bring it in. When it was already negotiated that we could bring a cake in if we paid a $100 fee (which is ridiculous) but it was a special themed $300 cake so my sis was ok with it.  When I first walked in I had a btl water I was drinking mind you its 110dg out and the girl at the door made me throw it away. Excuse me we have a $650 min & are about to spend over $1000 here tonight and you want to bug me about \"A bOTTLE\" of water ? After the chaos at the check in the guy that walked us up to our bay & cabana was informative and nice. Our server this sweet cute Asian girl was super attentive to us. Our biggest complaint is that it's HOT AS SHIT there!!!! It's def not a place to go in the Vegas summer heat. I saw posts stating there's temperature controlled bays and cabanas well that's a LIE because nothing had air coming in unless you went into the BATHROOM!!! We were swearing so bad we had to take breaks in the bathroom standing there to get some air. The pool water was warm. That was the only thing that's temperature controlled. Get it together and put some air conditioning in this place or in the bay's or else I don't think people enjoy sweating their asses off. Other than that the food was absolutely delicious !!!! We ordered the Vegas steak and scallop platter $225 pretty expensive but what do you expect for Vegas? We are locals so we are use to this type of pricing of we wanna step foot on the strip ! Rock shrimp, sea bass sliders etc all were GREAT!!!!",

    "text": "Just a disappointment. No self parking. Local Las Vegan arrived at 10am on a Sunday and waited 90 minutes for a golf bay. I tried to make a reservation ahead of time but didn't want to commit the $250 minimum in food/drink.  Waited and waited to valet. Waited to check in. Waited and waited for a golf bay. Ordered a Stella while I waited and they were out of Stella. Out of Sam Adams too.  So we ordered two Cokes and the bar tender left the bar.  Had to reorder from a different bartender. While waiting for our bay I asked why there were open bays.  Were they reserved?  Nope.  They just didn't have the staff to service the stations. So we left. Disappointed.  This place operates like a nightclub w/ golf.",

Had a total blast and I would definitely do it again! Friendly and efficient staff! The only thing was that we had about a 2 hour wait but it was worth it!

    "text": "We were visiting the area and found this Top Golf. We have a Top Golf back home and figured it would be a fun few hours to kill.  First thing we noticed is that the prices are DOUBLE what they are compared to back home (Tampa, FL). $60 an hour for a bay?? When we first pulled up we saw the parking lot was 1/4 full, so we assumed there wouldn't be a wait. Wrong. When I checked in with the girl at the counter she let us know there would be a 30-45 minute wait. She then asked what level we wanted. The 1-2 level was cheapest ($90 an hour for the 3-4 level). I told her the 1st level was fine. I was then informed the 1st level was closed for maintenance, so it wasn't available. I then said the 2nd level was fine.  First thing that was aggravating was that we were told it was a 30-45 minute wait, but there were at least 10 bays that were open on the 2nd floor. We went to the bar where there were 2 bartenders were working. We waited almost 10 minutes before we were served. Drinks are pricy ($12 for a Bloody Mary), but being in Vegas we assumed it would be a higher price than back home.  Be warned the bay's are not air conditioned. There was a nice breeze when we went so it was bearable. The waitress who serves us was a little snobbish when she first came to serve us. I asked  if they did pitchers of bloody Mary's (they serve such a thing back home) and I was greeted worth a scoff and an eye roll followed by \"Oh sweety.... We don't have such a thing\". First off I'm not your sweety. I also don't appreciate the scoff and eye roll. Totally unnecessary. It made everyone in my party stop ordering drinks all together due to the lack of professionalism.   All in all I don't know if we we'd ever be back to this Top Golf next time we're in town. The prices, wait time, and lack of professionalism was enough to make us look for a driving range in the area where we can get a bucket of balls for $1",

Me and my husband enjoyed 3 hours of great atmosphere, music, drinks and food. There are 2 pools on the top floors for everyone 21 & over. They have a family friendly floor with games for all to play Bathrooms were big, clean with lockers. If you go before noon it is only $30 for an hour (plus one time membership fee of $5 per person). We were on the 3rd floor and paid $75/ hr but it was well worth the fun. Each bay has a small L shaped couch with a table and lots of misters everywhere. Vegas is hot and they clearly got climate control down to perfection. We will be going back soon. Great time!",

    "text": "Ok, so as a Vegas local, there is always something NEW and SHINEY in town.  From a new bar, club, restaurant, show....or whatever.  Most of the time, these new things fall outside the realm of family friendly.  Bars and clubs...obviously not family friendly with pre-teens or teens Restaurants...so often really want to go, but don't feel like shelling out 50 a head for a 13 year old. Shows... just expensive most of the time.    But TopGolf was Great!  My wife and I took our son and it was fantastic!  Yes, it was not cheap entertainment for a Saturday night (would have been better Wednesday Afternoon) But the place is just tremendous.  Ok...So for the good.  The space is fantastic.  The Technology is Sweet, the bay's are well cooled / heated and the view is great.  6:30 on Saturday night and we got right in to a bay, got drinks ordered, food on the way, and a well run preview of how all the technology / games worked.  The almost good - Apparently, the terminals were all supposed to be hard wired in but some were still running wirelessly.  This presented an issue for a space where there appears to be a lot of competition for bandwidth...but they mentioned that this should be worked out by next week.  The almost good - Sorry to say, but most of the food was good , adequate , passable , ok.  The fish sliders were the best, while some of the other dishes were ok, and some were obvious filler.  Ask your server for recommendations, and hopefully they will get this worked out.  The doughnut holes were really good...  The really good - The technology of the driving range makes this like nothing you've done before.  Its not just grip it and rip it and the cross over Golf/Bowling/Darts kinduve thing makes it really fun.    The Exceptionally Great - Ok, lets be honest. You know what you get when you have Las Vegas with mediocre service?  yup...Atlantic City.  So the bar is pretty high for service around here and TopGolf has Service In Spades!  Everyone was friendly, helpful, smiling, and as a general rule, really were proud to be there... Highlight of the night was Margo L.  Who gave my son some pointers on the game (she's got a great swing) and we just loved the way she took care of us in the way that \"regulars\" and \"high rollers\" are treated in this town...despite being anything BUT.  I've had a number of customers and clients tell me that they are excited about TopGolf coming to Vegas and they all want to go when they come to town.  I'll be sure to ask to be assigned to one of Margo's Bays.  She's every bit the superhero her cape implies!  So, yeah, there are a number of really nice reviews here.  In Vegas, that's important.  In Vegas that is EVERYTHING.  And when you can impress locals...you've done a great job!  So, next time, make a space in your schedule to hit up TopGolf Las Vegas.  Its one of 2 of their 3rd Generation Ranges and well worth your visit!  Oh...and one more thing...they are open until 4am on The weekends...seriously?  Finally something for those of us who want to go all night, but don't want to do it at a 20.00 a drink club.",

I'm definitely going to make this a new tradition in our upcoming Vegas trips.   We walk from Caesar's Palace to top golf thinking I wasn't going to be that bad but it was farther than expected. I do recommend taking a taxi or their shuttle that leaves from MGM",

    "text": "First time at TopGolf here in Vegas.  I signed up online for a membership (only $5 and it's lifetime).  I called to see about getting a card (per the website, said a membership card can be picked up at check-in).  The girl I spoke to said \"YES\" you can pickup your card.  When I got to TopGolf and asked for my card, I was told they don't give them out at the Vegas location.  Oh well...your cell phone number works as your card and is needed to login the computers anyway...so no big deal.  YOU MUST HAVE A $5.00 MEMBERSHIP TO PUT YOUR NAME IN THE COMPUTER (explained below).  PARKING -- there is no parking (didn't know this until we pulled in and guy who I thought was valet told us we had to follow the signs on Koval Ave to Valet). It took a while for the shuttle to show up but it was only a 45 second drive back to TopGolf. The shuttle back to the valet was pretty quick showing up.  Guess you can park at the MGM (locals park free until December :) )  We did valet at Wet Republic...or whatever it's called...I just followed the blue and white TopGolf valet signs on Koval and it took me right there.  It did seem confusing going in for the first time...MANY employees standing at the top of the stairs....they are the ushers I guess.   Just go to the check-in counter when you get there.  For our group I checked in and the others just met me at the bay.  We had 4 golfers and chose the lower level which was $60 per hour (plus the $5 for membership for EACH player).  EACH MEMBER WHO PLAYS AND PUTS THEIR NAME IN THE COMPUTER MUST PAY $5 (added to the bill).  We didn't know this when our group of 4 went.  You have to put in your name, e-mail and phone number in order to put your name in the computer. The computer touch screen didn't work very well (bay 125) and had to wait or retype.  It took us a while to get 4 player names inputted.  If you're already a member, it only takes your phone number so suggest doing the membership online before you come.  The bays are pretty cool...seating for about 6 (at the bay we had). There are electrical outlets and a shelf to charge your cell phones so suggest bringing your charger..it came in handy.   The \"bay manager\" or waiter was nice but was hard to catch him...he seemed to have many tables and we were far from the bar which took longer for drinks.  They staff switched about 20 minutes into our stay and the 2nd girl was better but seemed overly busy.  I noticed many of the staff standing around near the lower level bay entry..not sure why...they stood there most of the night.   Suggest getting a bay close to the middle/near the bar if you want quicker service.    Game play -- There are a variety of games to choose.  We played high score first...you just have to hit a ball into any target area, closer to the pin is more points.  The balls have sensors in them so that's how scoring is accomplished.  Quite a few times it took a while to register the score  and a few times it didn't register at all.   The computer screen gives you info on all the games so you can choose the one you want. The clubs are ok...not the worst.  I guess you can bring your own clubs if you're really serious about practicing your game.  My bro-in-law is a 0 handicap golfer and he did fine with the clubs they provided.  He hit the far net with driver quite a few times.  It's about 220 to the far net....but the screen kept saying 215 when the bar registered.  DRINKS ARE EXPENSIVE -- yep, it's Vegas...4 draught beers was $32.00.  OVERALL -- Hitting balls was fun...a bit pricey on the todal cost for me.  I'm hoping now that I'm a \"member\" that I'll get text and e-mail discounts or deals. Turned out to be $180 with 4 golfers, 2 hours, with drinks.  We of course tipped pretty well. The ladies who work there are very attractive too...just sayin'  MILITARY DISCOUNT -- 10%",

We said maybe can we think about it and finish our food and decide. She said no if we didn't want to extend we couldn't finish out good and we would have to get our shit and move to side.

    "text": "This place is a ton of fun, but it could get expensive fast.  Holiday weekends are $110/hour of golf and bottle service starts at $250/bottle.  This place could get dangerous after a few drinks in - I've seen players accidentally throw their clubs and I've seen close calls of spectators wandering inside the red line.  They even have optional cabana areas if you wanted to dive into the pool instead of golfing.  They need to fix the parking problem, cars were backed up into the main street blocking traffic.  Good thing we UBER'd there. I'm coming here on every one of my Vegas trips.",

Shout out to Nathan who made amazing drinks and gave excellent service!  4 different floors with 4 different vibes.  *we came in at 8pm on a Sunday night*  1st floor is family friendly. Super chill with a bar behind the bays. I also saw a jenga game there.  2nd floor is also family friendly but seems a bit more lively with a bigger lounge area and bar.  3rd floor is 21 and over with a lot more space to chill with lounge area/bars/gambling machines and a pool.  4th floor also 21 and over but more like a nightclub atmosphere. Music seemed louder. Bar is busier. There are just a few bays up there. There's a lot more space to just drink and hang out. They could seriously turn the 4th floor into a nightclub or something. I think you can smoke up there too.  Food was also great!! Kalbi short rib tacos are a must!!",

An alternative to bowling, this is a fair price activity for a group (excluding food and drinks). It was well planned for folks to socialize and move easily through the space. While there are sounds and screens everywhere, it wasn't overwhelming. The food was really delicious - mac n cheese, brisket, and pulled pork. For parking, it is limited at TG; however, it's a few minute walk from the MGM garage. Service was also attentive for it being a busy weeknight.",

If you want to charge double, service needs to step it up. One can only hope this is a one off...  Update: Went the other night with some friends and we sat down at a table in the bar area. Sat for 20 minutes and no one acknowledged. Walked by table multiple times clearing other tables that had since departed. Got up and left!",

Since I had never been, an employee took us to our \"bay\" area on the third level to show me what was up. There was an L shaped sitting area with a table and a heater (If needed) She showed me how the machine scores, and even how to hold the club (lol)  and golf. We had a waitress who was very attentive. I don't golf. And I am not any better than before, but the whole experience was really cool. For an hour and 15 min and 4 beers, it was about 120.00. It was worth it though, and I would do it again.",

Food and drinks are expensive. $8 for a beer, $12 for the cheapest item on the menu.  If you come here for the golfing aspect, you will be disappointed. The scoring system makes no sense and isn't publicized anywhere, so you have no clue where to aim and what point values each shot will earn. The hostess attempts to explain the games but rushes through and there's no information on the graphics on how to play.   As you're playing, you see where your balls are landing or what points you're getting because that TV is faced away from the golfer. If the entourage wants to follow along and tell you how you're doing, they have to read tiny font as that's how each score is shown.   We had (3) golfers and could only get through 120 balls in an hour. Each round is 20 balls per golfer so there was a lot of wait time between turns.",

    "text": "My friends and I went here a couple of days ago as we had heard a lot about it but none of us had been.    The facility is really cool as it's a multiple-levels looking out into a driving range set up with different colored flags where you try to hit your golf balls to get points.  Cool concept and amazing that the system can track every ball you hit and exactly where it went.  Again, the facility looks amazing and the staff was very friendly.  The gameplay itself leaves a lot to be desired.  The game is played by each player taking 5 shots and trying to score by hitting it to different areas of the driving range.  None of us really figured out how the scoring system works (sometimes you get double points and also extra points if your partner scored in the same frame, etc...pretty confusing).  Also, I thought it would have been more interesting if the game \"forced\" you to try to hit to different targets.  But mostly it was trying to hit it to the farthest flag for the maximum points.  As for the food, while it tasted pretty good, the menu selections were pretty surprising given the setting.  Most of the food is \"fancier\" than typical bar food.  Also, most of the food are finger foods but very saucy/messy.  Now combine this with having to use one set of rental clubs that have been touched by every other player that's ever played, and you can see it's not the most sanitary way to combine food with golf.",

By adding food and alcohol and knowing where you ball lands to get points, Topgolf just upped the ante! I had a lot of fun hitting some balls and beating my friends. Not bad for a first (second) timer. There are so many floors and things to do here so if you have a friend that doesn't enjoy hitting balls (I don't know how you wouldn't) they can drink or watch tv or go swimming in the pool. YES! There's a pool! It was raining when I was there so no one was swimming but it's there. My only concern would be the type of food that's served here. Burgers, chicken wings and such. Finger foods aren't good to eat when you have to handle dirty clubs. I would suggest foods on a stick would be better to serve. Or order a salad. But boo! That's boring.",

Guess it didn't help that my friend ordered a bottle of pinot noir, which was unnecessary and also the classiest thing any of us did that week.

I wanted to golf on the upper level (more $ for upper bays). It was booked out until 1pm for a private event. I was told to come back at noon to reserve a spot (which we did). We decided to lounge at the pool until a bay on 3rd floor was ready. We were told 30 min to hour wait at most (one of the first to reserve upper bays). The pool area is insane here. We had fun just lounging in pool watching basketball on the giant TV. The pool staff was down to earth and professional. The bar by pool was awesome. We didn't get a text for our bay until 2 1/2 hrs later. Good thing we were enjoying the pool and basketball. We decided not to golf at that point. The service at the golf reservation left a lot to be desired. 30 minutes and 2 1/2 hours is a big difference when we were one of the first people to reserve. Outside of the upper bay reservation, we had a fun time. The facility here is very cool. There is a shuttle at MGM for drop off and pick up. Guest can walk but it's best to use shuttle service IMO. TopGolf is a fun place to visit while in Vegas. I been to other TopGolf venues, this one is on a different level. The customer service from our bay experience knock this rating down.",

First, the bay's on the bottom and main level are way too cramped.  They claim they will hold 6 people, we only had 4 and barely had room to move around the poorly designed furniture (why have metal arms on the end of the couches, no place to sit down and put on shoes).    Second, the food we had was deplorable. The coffee tasted like dish water so we ordered a cappuccino but it had the same strange aftertaste (I'm not a coffee snob, I love McDonalds coffee). The Mexican rolls had a decent flavor but were too big and had too much rice around them so they were difficult to eat.  The chicken skewers had some kind of weird sauce that tasted funny instead of just being grilled.  At least the golfing experience was okay and the staff was friendly and very attentive.  Paying was painful, took 45 minutes to get our check and the only thing they comped were the coffees. I understand opening day issues (did NONE of these issues pop up during the soft opening, just wondering) but this is not the way to get locals back.  Unless I see a coupon on Groupon or some other discount, I won't be back anytime soon.",

We didn't have to worry about a single thing. My friends and I were able to enjoy each other's company, the golf, and also the incredible setting. Beautiful couches and a spotlessly clean environment. The only downside was that it was quite warm (as it is summer time in the desert). They could've included additional fans to make it slightly more comfortable. I cannot wait to come back for more fun!",

    "text": "I went there on Saturday night to celebrate my brothers bachelor party. I showed up early so I could ask the manager if they could do something special (like a sign or a coupon for my brother). I was directed to where the two managers sat and both of them acted like I was annoying them to ask if they did anything special for events like that. I was told  bro we don't do anything like that and then the went back to what they were doing on the computer. I understand that they don't do anything but they really brushed me off. Then after they checked me in we were taken to a waiting area while a bay opened up. We ordered a pizza while we waited. The pizza came just as our bay opened up. Before we could start a new tab in our bay we were told we couldn't get started until we went back to pay for our pizza. I was happy to pay, but the clock was ticking on our 1 hour reservation on the bay and our waitress was not helpful. She was really put out that I explained that our clock was ticking and it would be easier for us if we could just pay all at once so we didn't have to waste our valuable time. Then a greeter came over of some sort to explain to us how to work the game and get everyone set up. He was nice and helpful but then at then end of his 1 minute speech he announced that he worked on tips and stood there awkwardly until we tipped him. I don't feel like you need to tip someone at top golf for taking 1 minute to show us how to work the computer and then be expected to tip the waitress as well. Overall it was just a poor experience and we were just a number. I have been to Top Golf in Gilbert Az and the experience was far superior. Las Vegas can do a lot better.",

The servers were great, but there was a ridiculous amount of confusion when I explained that I had not paid for the soda my daughter got while we were waiting. Evidently adding it to the food tab was somewhat challenging??? The food options were mediocre and a little pricey. In fact the entire concept is pretty over priced. We paid 75.00 for an hour plus food came to about 150.00 total. This is more like bowling than golfing so if you are a serious golfer bring your own clubs and a glove. Overall it was fun to do, but I probably will not do it again.",

    "text": "My friends and I were at Top Golf on Sunday, August 21st. Our server was August at booth 209. She was very attentive and sweet. Then at the end of the night, when the second level was closing and we were waiting to close out our tabs, a heavy set African American security guard was being very rude and trying to rush us out. We were still waiting for August to come back with our credit card receipts so that we could sign them and he says, \"Are these guys done yet? I have things to do, they're wasting my time.\" It was very rude, disrespectful, and unprofessional.  We finished signing our tabs and started walking out and he continued yelling at us in the lobby and threatening to call 911 on us. Then when I asked him for his name he got quiet and wouldn't tell us and started walking the other direction. The manager, Brent Klimow, then approached us and we spoke to him for a bit. We also asked him what the security guard's name was and he wouldn't tell us. I've been here a few times now and my friends wanted to check it out but I've never been treated so poorly, especially for no reason. If the security guard had things to do after he got off work, he should still be professional and finish his shift. There was no reason for him to be as rude as he was. We knew they were closing and we weren't just lounging there for no reason, we were waiting for our server to come back with our tabs. We're all locals and work in the industry and the way he was acting is not how anyone should be treated.",

    "text": "My FAVORITE spot on the Las Vegas Strip !! After a wonderful dinner at MGM, and a long concert following at the Garden, my group wanted to stay on property. With the current properties all charging for parking it makes more sense to carpool, and plan all your nights events in one property.  We were able to attend a poppin new dinner spot, attend Ariana, win some money, change, and make it to Top Golf .  We had someone hold a bay, even though it wasn't a guarantee , even though we were getting out late from Ari, the mgmt were still kind to hold our bay!!   Everyone treated us so warm and even though it was later , we never felt rushed. We order some food, after hitting a few balls, and the shrimp bites, burgers, and injectable donuts were ooey gooey and melted in my mouth   The female manager checked on us through the night and you can really tell she takes pride in her job and employees. The whole staff have a whole , fresh team spirit that is all about having a great experience. They all seem so happy and it makes you feel part of it all . Unlike some night venues that make you feel like you are a nuisance . I would defiantly chose spending a night here , than a night club.  The game itself is so much fun! Even like a beginner like myself. I was the newest one to hitting there, and was second behind the Champion Daniel who is good at ALL sports. Toward the end, idk what came over, but maybe the over the knee high heel boots, or the plunging Bebe top, but I KILLED it and won, beating him!! I was beyond shocked and I can't wait to go back and try in more appropriate wear. Girls were playing too, and there is food, and shuffle board , pools, TVs. PLease check it out! TopGolf is the best spot in town!!",

    "text": "We had SUCH a great time at this top golf location! I haven't been to top golf in years (I used to go to the one in VA) and my friends have recently gone to the one in phoenix; but, this was all our first time at this location and first time at one with a pool - and it was a blast! I contacted Top Golf ahead of time to make a reservation - they don't take plain reservations, but if you're going to book a premium bay with a food&beverage minimum, they will. Our cab driver on the way there made us nervous by telling us that package is a rip off and we should just cancel and wait for a bay, but we were SO glad we did it!   I spoke with Mike to book our bay ahead of time and he was honest about all of the prices and didn't try to sell me the most expensive option. The only confusing part was that when I called back to book, he asked me what he had quoted me and when we checked in, the lady asked me what I had been quoted - which leads me to believe, they tell different people different prices.  Overall, we had 8 people and one pool bay was plenty. The pool was on one side and the golf targets on the other. We had a $450 food and beverage minimum to meet, but that was pretty easy with 8 of us getting plenty of food and drinks for the four hours we were there. We were committed for 2 hours to the bay and paid extra for every hour after that. Our waitress was wonderful - we had already gone into the third hour and were approaching the fourth and she came to the pool where I was and advised me that no one had hit any golf balls in close to an hour, so to avoid continuing to get charged, we should just move over to the pool area and we could still order food and drinks there if we wanted.  The food was great! We tried the edamame, onion dip, mushi, fries, wings, margherita flatbread, garlic flatbread, and the injectable donut holes. We LOVED the mushi and the donut holes - we got multiples of those dishes throughout our time there.  The drinks were wonderful too - with the money we had to spend, it was a blast getting pitchers of beers, trying different cocktails, and ordering shots.  We had such a blast and I would definitely recommend it if you're celebrating something special or want to guarantee that bay by the pool!",

Tyler was able to make the reservation and we actually were upgraded because the size of our group. Started off ok with the alcohol coming out within about 15 minutes. The food took over an hour an a half!!!! Most of my party left to go elsewhere to eat. Some went back to the hotel to eat and others went to the bar to order.  We had about 15 minutes left on our reserved time and the food platters came out! Absolutely ridiculous. Waste of a night. I suggest spending your money elsewhere!!!!!!!! Didn't even get to enjoy the golf since we were all hungry. Server apologized and told us that for some reason the kitchen was slow. 45 minutes is slow. And hour and 45 minutes means our order was never placed or they ran out of food. Stay away from Top Golf Vegas.",

We had checked their Web site amd Yelp in advance and the chiliquilles looked great and they were. They were full of flavor and the salsa was spicy just how I like it. The pork was scarce but it was enough protien with the egg. We shared and it was enough for two with a delicious fresh bowl of fruit on the side. The Bloody Mary was fabulous and I do know my Bloody Mary drinks.  Golf was fun. It is a good way to test your accuracy. We had a treat time and next time we will spend more time there.  The bathrooms were super clean, always a plus.   We will be back in June and hope to bring some family and friends.",

    "text": "This is a great alternative and something different for Vegas other then casinos and bars! The inside is very nice!! The have a side bar area with big TV's and some games that is great and plenty of space. I should have done my research online before just showing up but it was more of a spontaneous group date night. The pricing really caught me off guard. I know any type of activity in Vegas especially something fairly a newish establishment like this would be a little pricey but it was a lot more then what I had in mind. The pricing changes depending on what level you choose to play on.. bottom, middle, or top. Obviously the top is most expensive. Pricing also changed depending on the time of day and day of the week so I would recommend going way early! For the same level a few hours later it doubles in price. We choose the bottom floor which brought us to 80 dollars an hour basically. We loved how you get almost your own little area, very spacious, and its a great view. Food and drink if you could've guessed are just as outrageously priced. Almost 10 dollars a beer and meals almost 15-20 dollars. An hour goes by very quickly and almost not even worth it especially when you're with a larger group. Service was good seeing how busy they look like they constantly are. I would say it's definitely an experience worth trying once or for a special occasion with a very large group where everyone can pitch in a large amount towards your cost but not a place we can partake in frequently, on our budget at least.",

But what is unfortunate is how long you can have to wait for something quite pricey and short. Now the price does make sense, they aren't located so close to the LV Strip for nothing.  Regardless the price paid for the bay, drinks, and appetizers at the end of the night was enough for me to think of it as a one or two time thing. It's a cool experience and I felt like their service was great!",

At this location, you pay by the hour for each station which made it really affordable for our group of 8 to play for a couple hours. We also were able to order a few menu items which were great (brisket tacos, yum!) as well as cocktails / beer while we played. The servers and bartenders were all really friendly and helpful, we had a great time!   I look forward to checking out Topgolf locations in other cities, I've heard they're all a bit different!",

    "text": "TopGolf should be called TopDollarGolf.  It would have gotten five stars if it weren't for the massive bill we received when we were ready to go. That shocked everyone. The food prices are reasonable and the drink prices are what you would expect for a spot off the Vegas Strip, but the golf prices are astronomical!  The views of The Strip from this place are great, the food is good, and the high-tech driving range is cool. It's like bowling where you rent a lane, but instead of paying per game, you pay per hour. Oh, and every player also needs to pay for a \"membership\".  We had a group of 15 and were there for about three hours. Some of us had food, some didn't. Most of us hit a few balls, some didn't. About half of us had food, so I estimated that our average food and drink bill per person was maybe $35, and that is stretching it. That means it cost over $675 for golf. That's $225 per hour! So each lane was $112.50 per hour. Maybe they added a huge tip into the bill, but we couldn't find it.  The place is fun, but not $1,200 worth of fun.",

    "text": "Great concept and it really has that Vegas vibe. I stay at the MGM Signature a lot and if you're not fortunate enough to get a strip view, your consolation prize is a Topgolf view. My friends and I always talked about trying it out and we finally got around to it this past weekend. When I went on the their website to get some more info, I was surprised that they had several other locations across the country, not to mention some spots overseas.   We went on a Sunday night and the wait was a bit long, which wasn't unexpected. The top level was closed for whatever reason, the 2nd level had a wait of about an hour and a half, and the bottom had a half hour wait. We were running a little tight on time so we went with the bottom. Although, not sure we would've waited the hour and a half if our schedule permitted it.  It's been years since I've swung a golf club and it was pretty nostalgic for me. There are targets you aim for, and the balls you hit are tracked. The system adds all the players' points up automatically; it's pretty great. Our attendant explained that there were different types of games available, but I think we went w/ the basic one.  I didn't order any food for myself, but my friends got a couple things that I sampled. The nachos were amazing and are on my to-order list for the next time I drop by. I'm going back to Vegas in September and I'm gonna make sure we set aside a couple hours for a Topgolf session.",

It's full of music and people having fun...Each floor has a bar and TVs and couches so it's awesome for watching games. They have a pool with cabanas, and downstairs they have one GIANT screen. Golfing is paired with other games like cornhole and shuffle board. This place is NOT just for experienced golfers, and level will enjoy this. It's simplified so you basically just smacking balls into certain areas for points. Each table has couches so it's so comfy to chill and grab a pitcher of beer and relax. Moving on to the food...  omg yum!!! We tried the nachos and I would say a must have is the giant Bavarian pretzel. It's like a charcuterie Board with sausage and cheese and dried fruit but all tucked into one big yummy pretzel. Wether you're visiting Vegas or a local this place is a must try. Plus check them out for all sorts of entertainment, events, Sunday brunshes and dj's!",

We decided to put our names down and then just eat dinner at the bar and see if the wait lets up.  We sat our selves in the open sitting area and waiting a good 15 minutes before we were greeted by a server. I know this place is a busy place, but I feel like the wait times were really long.  We kept asking our server for our drinks and the appetizer and he said \"look around we are really busy right now, the kitchen is really backed up, it'll be out as soon as it's done\". I was like okayyyyy. Then we asked if we can order our main food then. 30 minutes later our main food came out and still no appetizers. When we asked the server for it he said that he didn't have any idea why it wasn't out yet. Come to find out that he never put them in, so the appetizers ended up coming out while we were midway through our meal. This me totally ranting so here is the stuff you guys want to know:  We ordered the steak plate, there were 5 of us. - really good kabobs definitely was enough food for us. We have 3 girls and 2 boys. My favorite was the chicken with tzaiki sauce and the pita brea  We got the tater tots, salt and vinegar chips and the smoked wings. - tater tots and wings were delicious - salt and vinegar chips were super crispy we just wished we tasted more of the vinegar  While we were paying for dinner we got a text to let us know our bay is open. The service at our Top Golf bay was way better than at the bar.   We ordered the injectable donuts and they were AMAZING.  I would recommend coming here. Just expect a long wait. It's a great place for avid and beginner golfers. It's more a huge arcade game.",

The staff here is always energetic and happy to say hello with a smile.     Tyler and D.J. have always been great help when I need to make a booking for friends visiting town.  Saturday and Sundays sell out every single week now so it's important to make reservations 2-4 weeks prior for prime time slots.    In my opinion it's worth paying extra for Level 3 and if you have a large party there is a private area on Level 4 you can rent out!  If you have 2-4 people I suggest 1 hour.  If you have 6-8 people 2 - 3 hours is great!  The food and drinks are amazing!  My personal favorite is the PB&J PORK BURGER.  It's so unique and tasty.    Pricing does fluctuate based on the day and time so it's best to call the venue and ask for D.J. or Tyler to book your time slot!  Mention that Brian T. sent you!",

    "text": "SHORT REVIEW: Here's the Good, the Bad, and the Ugly.   THE GOOD:  TopGolf has made the driving range a lot more fun.  Pounding ball after ball at your local municipal course drags, especially when your ball slices to the right or hooks to the left.  Here at TopGolf, all those worries are gone. You can enjoy a day or night at this range sipping on a few drinks, grubbing on some food, and watching the big game all at the same time.    THE BAD:  There's not much that I would complain about.  But if I had to pick, then it would be the parking.  You can either walk here or valet.  Self-parking would be a great addition.  TopGolf is also missing a putting green.   THE UGLY:  My golf game.  I am really bad at this.  But you know what they say...a bad day at golf is better than a good day at work.   LONG REVIEW: One thing about individual sports is finding a fun way to practice it.  Bowlers have Cosmic Bowling.  Pool players have the local bar.  Dart players have Cricket. But what about the people that enjoy golf? All they have is miniature golf and that really doesn't count.  Putting a red golf ball passed a waterfall, through the clowns teeth, and under a windmill for a hole in one just isn't fun anymore.  Well, those days are gone.  TopGolf has arrived and they aren't going anywhere anytime soon.  TopGolf Rocks!!  I had such a great time at TopGolf that I even texted a few friends and family to get their butts here as soon as possible.  TopGolf is all about fun and entertainment.  Don't come here expecting to hone your golf skills so you can one day make the PGA Tour.  You come here for the experience and fun with friends/family. What makes TopGolf so fun is the different games that you can play and track on their handy dandy computer.  Accuracy games?  Yes, they have it.  The closer you get to a pin, the more points.  Sweet!!  Team games?  They have that too.  And what about those \"grip it and rip it\" types that just enjoy tagging that little white golf ball as far as they can.  Well, TopGolf has that to a point (range is about 250 yards deep). TopGolf is perfect for groups, teambuilding, parties (not the Vegas Baby type parties), and just chillin' with friends & family.    LIST OF OTHER THINGS THAT TOPGOLF HAS TO OFFER.  -Driving range has 4 floors. The 1st and 2nd floor is for all ages. The 3rd and 4th floors are for adults.    -Equipment is provided, but you can also bring your own.  The first two floors have decent graphite shafted cavity backs.  They provide a Driver, 3-Wood, Hybrid, 4 Iron, 6 Iron, 8 Iron, and PW.  Clubs are provided for men, women, kids, and lefties. On the 3rd and 4th Floors, the clubs are Callaway Big Bertha's.    -Awesome Service:  A++ from the moment we arrived.  We had our own hostess that was very attentive and at least 3 different employees checked on us.  And when our game wasn't working properly, a tech was called and fixed it right away.  He also comped us 15 minutes.   -You basically rent a space, which includes your own TV, couches, golf caddy, and even a couple of usb ports to charge your phone.   -Food:  There's a lot on the menu to get your feastmode on.  The food is not just limited to fried bar food either.  Here's a tip...don't skip the Injectable Donut Holes.    -Bar and Drinks:  You can order your drinks through your hostess or at one of their multiple bars armed with video poker machines.  They have beer pong too.  On a side note...I once won a beer pong tourney at the Excalibur back in the day.  Just saying.  -Huge TV's everywhere, including a couple of big screens at the end of the range.    -Swimming Pool:  Yes, there's a pool here.     -Price:  Cost is by the hour with the best rates during the day.  At first, I thought that TopGolf was on the pricey side. But then I came to my senses and realized what our money gave us back in return.   OVERALL:  I had great time and can't wait to come back.  A golf range is where you go to practice your swing and improve your handicap.  TopGolf is for all skill levels looking to have good time playing a game that was never meant to be easy.  2016 Yelp Review #36",

We went on a night when they had live music on the mid level stage.  They had great sound system which was set the right level so you can still have a conversation and hear great music throughout the 4 levels of the venue.  Try a golf bag, which are their featured cocktails like margaritas and such.  A little pricy at $32 and $20 even with the plastic souvenir cup but the cabana drink was tasty. There are bars on every floor so you will not go thirsty. Both draft and bottle beer choices have several great craft beers to select from. Even some local Nevada brews and they prices are typical for the strip at $8-$10 each.  We snacked on the Forager Flatbread while we were there.  Very tasty with quality ingredients.  Food comes out of one central kitchen and can be served on all levels of the facility.   Besides apps, burgers, sandwiches and wings can be had but I think I might have to come back for the desserts.  The selection and execution of these items looked amazing.  The views of this place are absolutely breath taking.  To be in such a brilliant facility with views of the strip at night was just WOW!.... Enjoy!",

It was straight in for the first level, about 20 mins for second level and they said over an hour for the top deck. We went for the lower level as my husband doesn't like the height of the next 2 decks.   If you do get stuck waiting there's lots to do. Great food, drinks, other games like cornhole and tabletop shuffleboard which is surprisingly fun. It's pretty easy to kill an hour or so here.   The golf is fun and it's good for anyone. Non golfers like it here too. I'm not sure any of us takes the point seriously other than who's winning and who's losing. That's just for bragging rights.   The service at the bays is always good here and in Scottsdale. Your drink will never go dry and food comes quickly. The wings are great, nachos good and 7 layer dip is awesome. Ps wings are really messy to eat when you need to grab a golf club. Also I make good use of my hand sanitizer considering I'm touching the shared golf clubs and eating finger food. (Don't overthink that one!)  The view of the strip is really nice especially from the top deck. Sure it can be pricey here but so is everything in Vegas. I'll be back!",

We were 4 shots into it and the computer froze! Wtf It's no wonder this place is so pricey. It takes forever for every step.

However, I'm giving 4 stars because the first time I went everything was working fine, however the second time, the computer system was bugging out really bad and doing things like not scoring points, or changing the player that was selected to   Update : went again last weekend. Just as fun as ever, still had a few system bugs and the cameras not working quite right, but it was better than last time. Edward Feeney was one of our servers and provided excellent service.

    "text": "What a great place to go to as an option when you're in Vegas besides the gambling, shows etc. Place to hit golf balls with your friends and family enjoying both alcoholic and regular drinks. Mix that with music and huge displays at the end of the range. Night time can be crowded probably because it's less hot at night but you also get the lights here. The thing that makes this place fun is that they have different targets to hit where you can earn points to play against your friends/family. Easy to set up on the monitor when switching between players and easily wave the club in front of the ball dispenser to get started.  It can be a bit expensive per hour but it makes it worth it with more people so you can easily split the cost. Besides drinks, they also have food here you can order. Place is also kid friendly as we took our 22 month old daughter here at night. Only bad thing in my opinion about this place is the parking. Yes you can get shuttled from MGM Grand but if you're driving yourself and not staying/visiting MGM, you'll get lost finding the parking spot here. Just look for a sign off Harmon that says DO NOT ENTER and park in this lot. Most people park here if you're not using their valet services.",

They also said that if you call, you automatically get forwarded to the corporate headquarters and that they have no real idea how long the wait really is. After waiting 3 hours for a booth they told me I was not allowed to have any drinks because I was \"too intoxicated\". I am writing this review from my booth. The service was terrible. I waited 30+ minutes for food which was served cold. Every employee I have interacted with was incredibly rude and frankly disrespectful. I have been to several Top Golfs and this is by far the worst. I know being located in Las Vegas calls for extra precaution but the employees were TERRIBLE. I asked for the gentleman's name who refused me service and I was told 5 completely different aliases. I was also denied services for simple requests such as a glass of water or simple condiments. In general this was by far the worst Top Golf experience I have ever had and I will not be returning.",

Three stars were given because after we were settled in and excited to play, we were re-seated twice. Not a great first impression for our company outing. The woman who sat us moved us because another party was coming in an hour (and we had paid for two hours.) I would assume that the hostess/front told her the length of time we would be there so we didn't have to play musical chairs.   Not only that, but she rushed off without explaining to our group what we were to do next. We were confused about the memberships, she didn't explain the game nor equipment (as we were all there for the first time.)   We requested another tee as one of our members were left handed and it didn't come until an hour later.   However- the f&b service was good. We had a couple of requests here and there and they were on it. Food was good as well.   I think they definitely have their kinks to figure out since it's a new property, but I didn't think it would be that apparent on a slow Wednesday afternoon. Would we come back? I would. It's a cool spot to take a group. I just imagine how crazy it must be on a weekend evening.",

The facility is pretty awesome, very clean and lots of technology, plenty of room to hangout and eat and drink or play beer pong/corn hole. We came around 2 on a monday and there was plenty of people but no wait so we got a bay on the 2nd floor for an hour. The host and our server helped us get set up and playing in no time and then took our orders for drinks.  The games are pretty cool, there's a series of targets to hit at and your ball is tracked and you're awarded points for where you hit, had a fun time competing with my buddy for the best score. Drink service was quick and despite all the bad reviews we never had a problem with the technology.  My only complaint is the clubs they provide are not a full set so it made it difficult if you're a regular golfer to hit certain lengths, next time I'll bring my own clubs, had them in the car but didn't grab them this time.   Try it out, I'll be back",

Topgolf is conveniently located right behind the strip and luckily there was no wait to sign up (just a little wait for them to set up our area). Sunday night rate was $60 for 1 hour for up to 6 people in 1 bay plus an additional $5 pp if you're new because you have to sign up for a membership.  While we waited for our bay, we played some table shuffleboard (they ran out of sand, what? Lol but we made do) for about 10 minutes before we headed up to the 3rd floor to hit some golf balls! We also played some cornhole after our golfing session which was awesome. So much space to hang out!  Each area is nice with a L-shaped couch and table. Your area comes with clubs and 2 monitors to keep score of your points. There's also wait service if you want to order drinks or food (chicken wings were delish!). This is definitely a group activity for the fun factor, but having a lot of people means you hit less balls, so you decide how you want to play this lol.  I would definitely suggest hitting up this spot if you're in town for a while and don't want to spend every night in the casinos/clubs.",

Drinks, food, large screen TVs everywhere for those into sports, a swimming pool and as long as you're not on the first floor you get some pretty spectacular views of the strip. I highly recommend choosing the third floor if you are over 21 (as it is 21 + only). The views are better and it has a more poppin vibe than the first floor. I have never been to the 2nd so I can't speak for that one but for me third floor is where it's at. The bays for the golf are rented by the hr, not by person or game, so if you have a group of friends and split the price of the Bay it is not too pricey at all. It is cheaper during the day and cheaper on certain days of the week. I have only been at night and I think I will only go at night simply because I love the views and the vibe but if frugality is what you were after, go Monday early afternoon. The employees are very attentive and do a great job of explaining how it works if it is your first time. You get a server too so you can order food and drinks and they bring it to your bay! So it's basically like being at a bar but much much better!",

    "text": "I went there with a few friends this summer for an evening of golf fun and I have to say that this is a pretty good place even though it is rather expensive.  This place is located by the MGM grand on Koval Lane and there is a free shuttle from the MGM's main entrance which is convenient. The place also offers a large parking lot so no worries about finding a parking spot. The place itself is huge and has dozens of bays from which you can play.  The food and drinks there are good but rather expensive. For example, a classic cocktail there is $20. The pricing on golfing depends on the time and on the floor that you want to play from so it'd be easier to just go on their website and look it up. Golfing there is really fun though and you get a great view of the strip.  In conclusion, I would say that this place offers a good quality/price ratio and I would recommend it. Feel free to message me for any additional details that you may need!",

When we got there, one of the managers gladly took a good amount off the bill for us to help. It really restored faith in this place! Still, to swing some clubs around for a short time, you better bring your wallet! Make sure and call to check prices before you come so you know what you're in for. Now as far as this place and how much fun it is... it's a lot of fun! If you really like golf, you should do this for 3 hours if you have 4 or more people with you. I am very impressed with this place when it comes down to it with the music and vibe. Thanks and I will be back for sure.",

We sat there for around 1 hour as all of the waiters walked by us until one eventually asked us if we wanted anything. We waited another 30 minutes as we watched all of the golfing areas open up. We went back to the front desk and they finally told us it would be another 15 minutes. We left because we already waisted 2 hours.   Will not be coming back to this location ever.",

With over thirty family and friends in town for the big game, (UH vs UNLV), we wanted to do some kind of outing that we all could enjoy and still allow for everyone to spend time visiting.   Cousin mark set it up. Our reservation was for 10pm. Not sure if that's the last time or not, but after two and half hours of fun, we where walking out to an almost empty place.   Upon arriving, there was a live band playing, there are two levels, we where on top. The room reserved was quite large with an enclosed glass surround, long table for eating, a center bar with two tee's. There where couches and smaller tables for sitting and socializing offering a place to set your drink.   Once the food and drinks had been ordered, we took turns practicing our swing, trying to get that connection that would send that little white ball sailing through the air and land just right in the colorful holes out on the range. I never made it and gave up. It was too much fun watching the others connect!  There are large screen TV's for staying up with all things sports, a private bathroom in the suite and two very attentive servers, keeping the food and drinks flowing! It's a great place to enjoy good company. Definitely should be on the to do list.",

    "text": "Top Golf is awesome. I'm not even a golfer and had a lot of fun here. It is definitely a different experience than I've ever had at a driving range. It's kind of set like a bowling lane where parties have their own area sectioned from others but with comfy seating. If you want something just call them over. Get me more drinks, more food, a friendly face, etc. There's no buckets of balls all you have to do is wave your club near some sensor and a ball rolls out. Unlimited balls for the time you play!   One thing that stood out each time I've driven by were those huge tv screens on the other end of the driving range. They are a lot nicer now that I've seen them from inside of TG and very clear even when the Sun's out.  There's three floors of driving ranges. The 3rd floor costing the most. I don't remember the prices but there is a local's discount thats better than printing that coupon TG offered online.  On the 2nd floor they have an area with more huge tv screens to watch whatever games are on. They also have cornhole game. I'd use these before or after you're  done with the driving range since you're paying for the range usage.  We were on the 3rd floor which has what seemed like a pretty big bar and sweet swimming pool setup. It's getting cooler now so I'm not gonna use that pool unless perhaps I lost a bet and had to jump in butt naked jk. You can look down into the 2nd floor tv and cornhole area from up here. There's a 4th floor which I'm guessing is lounging area since 3rd floor was the top floor for the driving range. I didn't check it out.  The food was surprisingly good at least from what we had. We ordered the grilled backyard wings and a flat bread but the rest of the menu included items like kalbi short rib tacos, sashimi, pulled pork sliders, and more.  Back at the driving range they have heater controls so if it's too cold during the winter turn up the heat  Also for those like me who aint that good at whacking the balls for distance there's a game where your earn points based on accuracy, closes to various targets/holes throughout the range. It keeps it pretty fun and competitive among the party. Of course I won.  Yeap I'm definitely going back soon. By the way the environment is some what loud with music and people having a good time. My kind of place.",

I think this is one of the most family-friendly things to do in Vegas but it's something you can do with friends too when you want to kick back and have a beer, a good laugh and some friendly competition.

You can play in your swimwear which would probably be pretty interesting. Overall I recommend any topgolf location even if your not a golfers just the vibes and atmosphere is pretty cool. 5stars",

Turns out, this place is amazing! The view is awesome, the service is very friendly, and the clubs are quite good! You can select between different levels/floors. The first and second floor are equally priced, with the third being a little more expensive because of the pool and girls in bikini. One you sign up for your lifetime membership for 5$ each person, you will be taken to your assigned bay, where there are sofas and a table with a menu for food and drinks. The bay also has monitors that tells you a lot of info on the game and where you can watch the replays of every shot. There is a number of different types of game, but I found the \"top golf\" one the most fun, so we kept on playing that one. This place is a good choice for anyone, regardless of their levels. My suggestion is to come around sunset time/night to enjoy better the lights and the cool air.",

The atmosphere is loud and fun. Super fun. Be sure to call ahead and book a lane because it'll get filled up fast on a Saturday!!!   The food was ok. It's the actual golfing with friends that you'll love. It's like a driving range but you get points! Wave your club over the small hole and a golf ball will come out.   Th downfall of this place is that the service is terrible. Takes way too long to order something. Like seriously 30 min wait. If the food and service was better, it'd get 5 stars.   Anyway if you're an avid golfer you'll love this place. If you don't golf, you'll wanna come here anyway especially for a bachelor party or if you have a group of 6 or whatever. Super fun. You'll enjoy it for sure. Tacos were ok. Chips were delicious. Bucket of beer to add to the tacos. Yum.   Honestly... food was whatever haha. It's the golfing experience and the fun you'll have with your friends that really makes this place a worthwhile experience.",

The game is simple, hit the ball, aim for the targets or back wall, repeat. Before or after a game you can hang out at the bar to watch some sports with some good food.   The thing that topped off the whole experience was the staff. We had maybe four or five people help us through out the night and each one of them was extremely friendly and professional. Multiple times they went above and beyond with out us even asking. They helped keep the party going and made sure we enjoyed the evening taking care of our every need. Usually before we even knew we needed it!   I would definitely go again, but the price can add up if you're not careful. Even though more people can help cut the cost a little, I think having 3-4 people is ideal as you get more play time.",

Great thing about it is it's all conveniently located beside the MGM grand so you don't have to drive miles off the strip and get ripped off by taxis.

    "text": "I was so excited to check this place out! I went to Topgolf for lunch with two other coworkers. I also wanted to scope it out for events and meetings. The facility is amazing! The service, on the other hand, was at the opposite end of the spectrum. It took a long time for anyone to acknowledge us. When someone finally came over she said she would be back to take our order but she never did. After some time, another guy came over and took our order and then once we got our food the other server made an appearance to service the table. It took almost an hour for us to get our food. The sad part is we were sitting by a couple of managers that helped \"speed things up.\" I'm sure the experience would have been much worse had they not been sitting there. The food, when we finally got it, was great. However, service is very important to me and it also should be for people working in the \"service\" industry. I wouldn't go back for just lunch and would be hesitant to book any events there. We also found out that the pricing is dynamic, meaning depending on how popular, aka busy, they are it can change.",

    "text": "So my experience with golf consists of the handful of times I've been mini golfing. Since one of my friends is a big golfer and it was his bday, we decided to go to Topgolf. A few of our friends were already here, so we joined them on Friday, January 25th around 4:30pm.  *Espresso Martini: grey goose la vanille vodka, kahlua, rumchata, brown sugar, chilled black coffee ($14) *Bulleit Old Fashioned: bulleit bourbon, fee brothers orange bitters, monin pure cane, fresh orange, cherry ($14) x2 *Maker's Mark ($14): Manhattan (+$2) *805: blonde ale, 4.7% abv, firestone walker brewing ($8 pint) *Michelob Ultra Aluminum: 16 oz ($7)  I hit the ball a few times and just drank the rest of the time. Though being here did make me wanna get better at golf. Or at least swinging. Topgolf is fun as it's like playing a live video game. Your ball and scores get tracked. I just had fun watching and sipping my two cocktails for the 1.5ish hours we were here. In the end, it costs two membership charges at $5 each and $62 per hour in gameplay. (We were here a total of two hours.) A friend had a game credit, so we had $7.50 off.  Fun spot to hit some balls. And I do mean golf balls!",

Service could definitely have been better tho. Our server didn't give out very good vibes, even had a bit of an attitude, however our busser/runner KEVIN was really good. Not exactly sure what his position is, but he was super friendly, and engaging, unlike our actual server. I'm a Vanilla Vodka drinker and all they had was Pinnacle Whipped vodka which is soooo nasty so that sucked. They do have the Impossible Burger on the menu for all my vegan peeps, but unfortunately they didn't have any in stock - there IS currently a shortage like EVERYWHERE for them though, so we snacked on a bowl of fruit and some fries. Hitting the ball is HARD, but it seems like a really fun and cool atmosphere there, I would totally go back!",

The area where you sit and play was very clean, organized, and comfortable.  Every employee we interacted with was extremely hospitable and helpful. Plus: all of the employees are eye candy, so that always helps. Haha.   We ordered several drinks and food platters, so we got a chance to taste a lot, and everything was very good.   The golfing is SO fun and definitely brought the group together.  The only opportunity I could say is that the computer that you use to control the game took us quite a while to learn how to navigate.   But aside from that small detail, I LOVED this place!",

I was trying to book a reservation 4 weeks ahead of our scheduled visit to Las Vegas and I didn't like it because of all the times that I called no one was able to pick up my phone call! The weekend of our visit to Las Vegas came and I was able to hunt down a promoter and he was able to give us 10% off. If you have a local in your group make sure to use your local discount instead it's better than the 10% that a promoter would give you.   When we walked up the top golf we were able to just walk in and get a bay. There was an hour wait but we paid extra for a fancier bay. Staff was super friendly. It took some time to get left handed golf clubs however. Great experience overall. My friend had such a fun experience on his bachelor party here! We suck at golf.",

I'd probably golf for when I'm older like in Retirement but when I looked this place over online, I took a sudden interest and made an Exception. The company that my Dad worked for was paying for the whole thing, good thing too cuz on Saturdays (which is the night we were there) between 5 PM to 2 AM, it is 75 Dollars an Hour and that's way out of my Price Range.  We got together at the Bar with my Dad's Friends while having a Few Drinks waiting when to decide to go. But they were Shooting the Breeze and going and going, my Dad almost fell asleep (Twice), finally after being at the Bar for exactly an Hour and 24 Minutes we decided to head over there (Thank God). Driving through the hustle and bustle of the Sin City Nightlife was a 15 minute Joyride but we eventually got there. Going up the Neon Blue lit entrance up the stairs to the 2nd Floor where the Lanes were all set up waiting for you to Yell (FORE) with every swing of the Club you take while peering out at the Strip seeing things like Caesar's Palace and the High Roller at the Linq.  The Ground lit up in Red, Green & Yellow (possibly determining the Yardage distance or Something). Also there was some BBQ spread out for the Guests, Brisket, Smoked Wings, Cornbread, Pulled Pork, Mac n Cheese, Sausage, Coleslaw and Texas Toast. Coleslaw still had that Crunch while not being overly burdened with too much Mayonnaise, the Toast had that Crisp outside and light inside going on, both the Sausage and the Pulled Pork had that Smoky Emblem that says Good Barbecue, Cornbread was Rich, Pulled Pork was fall apart tender but the Wings were the least enjoyable thing (for me) of the Night as I thought the taste was a bit off and I wasn't liking the consistency of the Skin (Flabby). Mac n Cheese was pretty addicting too, had about 2 helpings of it, all the stuff I packed on my Plate resembled a Garbage Plate.  The drinks were free, just be sure to leave a generous Tip. All I had was a Pomegranate Liqueur and Sprite and a Kahlua Drink, didn't want to get a GWI (Golfing while Intoxicated). I played pretty good for the most part, my swing is not that good. I mostly got it out to in between 50-60 Yards (I'm not Tiger Woods for heaven's sake). I even went up to the 3rd floor and looked out at the Strip for about 10 minutes. Then eventually me and my Dad were tired, so after being there for almost 2 Hours we decided to take a Cab back to the Hotel and Sleep.  Like I said before I'm not a fan of Golf but this was a once in a lifetime experience that I was glad to take part in. What could possibly top That ? !!!",

    "text": "Topgolf is one of my favorite spots to lounge.  You can hit golf balls, drink, or eat.  But, at no expense, you can also watch sports, play lawn games, wade in the pool, or just hang out.  It is a perfect spot for a mid-day or evening activity for a bachelor party or group outing.  Admission to Topgolf is free.  If you want to hit balls, you rent a bay (an area with a driving mat and seating for six).  The rental prices range from $30-$75 per hour, depending on the time of day and what floor you are hitting from (there are four floors).  The price includes: (1) golf clubs; (2) unlimited golf balls; and (3) access to Topgolf games.  There are sensors in the golf balls, which track the distance of the balls and whether you hit the designated targets corresponding to each Topgolf game.    For the average golfer, the rental price seems steep because it is more than a bucket of balls at an average driving range.  However, the price is well worth it because Topgolf's interactive games and ability to track each ball is a lot of fun for all ages and abilities.    ALL-STAR ACTIVITY: afternoon at Topgolf.",

From missing every single swing when I first started, I was able to knock a few golf balls pretty far out by the end. The hourly rates are more than reasonable, especially if you have a big group. We didn't eat any food, but the drinks poured were decently priced and strong. They have staff visible at all times, so you're never left looking for someone to help you. Their interface is easy to use, letting you add time to your golfing session as often you like. Despite it being 100+ degrees outside, we were nice and cool during time we were there. I can't wait to come back!",

They have giant TVs, outdoor games, video poker at the bar, and ping pong tables.   We got our spot on the 2nd floor and can choose from a bunch of different games to play against your family or friends.  My favorite game was the one where you aim for a certain color and try to make it in the center.  It takes a couple of shots to get into the swing of it. Soon after, I was having a blast at Top Golf and won a few r. The Margarita was also cold and refreshing.   I plan on coming back again real soon!",

Now you want to get to the third floor (if you don't have kids with you) that is the party floor. They have a cool bar and rooftop pool up there. The view of the strip is unreal.   Let me be clear, I am not a golfer, but I love Top Golf! It's so much fun and nice break from the normal Vegas activities. Surprisingly they also have great food! Get the tots no matter that.   Inside tip: they offer $10 off coupons in the lobby of the MGM. Also, the Top Golf lounge will drive you there if you don't want to walk through the casino.   Please hurry and open one in San Diego!  IG tip: The course at night. It lights up and has an amazing view of the strip. Best view by far.",

My favorite by far was the pretzel cheese board. This thing was huge and had options for even the vegans in our group!  The golf was fun and I really enjoyed the various games they had on the computer. I won one so nobody could tell me nothin!!!!  A great place to hangout if you have a group.

We went early on Saturday morning and the wait was over an hour. The great thing about Topgolf is that there are plenty of places to wait until your bay is ready. Do yourself a favor and don't go with more than 6 people. Waiting for bays right next to each other must take forever.   The pools are really nice. From what I could tell they are just open for anyone to hang out in.   Tip- If you are staying on the strip you can walk to Top Golf through the MGM. We learned this the hard way. :-(",

Not my typical sort of place, for sure, as I've never been much of a sporty one, more for outdoorsy adventures somewhere remote, so going to a neon-lit golf club was an experience. As a first timer, the set up was a little confusing at first- you go in and find your way to the appropriate counter (there's an information desk AND a customer service desk), select your desired amount of time to play, then wait until you're escorted to the appropriate booth. The employees were all extremely helpful and polite, explaining things to us readily and with ease...the outfits they're forced to wear are pretty ridiculous, though! The plaid shorts, man. Food was tasty, albeit a bit expensive, but that's to be expected with any entertainment venue this close to the strip. Pretty good selection of options, too! The cost of your gameplay will vary depending when you go (rush hours vs weekday mornings) and how long you play, so keep that in mind. You can get a card to keep track of your scores on subsequent trips, so make sure to hang on to it!",

    "text": "Topgolf was one of the most enjoyable activities we've experienced in Vegas. We just returned from a fabulous trip and I couldn't wait to write a review for Topgolf, my first review of the trip. As a million other reviewers have noted, it's a fun place with bars, a pool, non golf activities (bean bag tossing, etc.) and an excellent driving range with targets you can shoot for that will track points. It's an excellent concept because it gives you accurate target practice and makes a lot less balls for them to have to retrieve with a cart. Smart idea. We liked everyone we interacted with from the staff, however the standout was the lesson we took from Sean Solodovnick. We booked a lesson with him and split him between my wife and I. Since she's a beginner he worked with her a lot but was really able to get her swing in a place where she can start to make progress. I am an intermediate golfer so he helped me with several things and I was already hitting the ball much straighter than before by the time we finished the lesson. Sean is also a very likable guy who is patient and more than eager to help you. We gave him a good tip because he definitely deserved it, so if you get a lesson you should do the same.  My only complaint would be the equipment and balls. Sean grabbed a real Callaway driver for me to hit with during our lesson which makes a night and day difference as their generic drivers are pretty mickey mouse. When I rented a bay upstairs after the lesson all they had were those wimpy little drivers and I couldn't hit them well, so I stuck to mostly the irons which were good irons (modern Callaways, which is my brand of choice). The balls are chewed up. If their concern is people taking them they could do what every other range does and mark the balls as range balls but these days if the balls are decent people probably steal those too so maybe their strategy is to have horrible balls so that nobody steals them. Even with that though the review stays 5 stars because it's overall a great experience and the lesson with Sean is something I should have done a long time ago. We will definitely add Topgolf into our activities agenda for any trips we take to Fabulous Las Vegas in the future.",

Our group arrived 15 minutes later and were told there was an event and we wouldn't be able to get in until 11. The girl at the door told us we probably spoke with someone at their corporate office and that they don't know what's going on. Absolute joke how this location is run.

It can get pretty spendy here, so make sure to go during happy hour times and take advantage of those local discounts. Top Golf is like a mix of a driving range and amusement park; filled with bright colors, loud music, and drinks; so many drinks. The pricing here varies depending on what level you're playing on, with the fourth level being the most expensive. They've just started offering an hour of golf for $24 for locals only, get on it!   I came with a buddy of mine, we played for an hour which cost sixty-dollars, but that covers up to six people, so the more bodies you bring, the cheaper it is. We were on the third level, and the view was awesome, a great look at the Strip and all four of the bajillion-inch TVs at the end of the fairway.  Even if you've never hit a golf ball, you'll still have a blast here.  Beyond golf, there's a pool area, an adult game spot with corn hole and two indoors bars if you just want to be near the action. Would I come here once a month, probably not, but when I have friends in town, this is a great alternative to the Strip or just eating your way through the valley.",

    "text": "Came to Topgolf for their March Madness event in 2017.  After searching for a good \"watch party\" in Vegas, I heard of Topgolf, and we decided to try it out.  The set up was pretty great.  It was $50 (plus outrageous ticketmaster service fees) which included 6 beers, a taco platter, and a very large T-shirt.  It was the usual Vegas crew of Mr. Booth, Bloewen, Buxton, and myself.    Our waitress was great.  Even though she was constantly very confused and fostered a couple awkward conversations, she was very nice, attentive, and provided great service during our time there.    I do have to say that the tacos were great, but it was very odd that they did not have any tortilla chips.  Buxton couldn't understand why no tortilla chips were offered.  We were told that they have a seven layer dip, but didn't understand how that is eaten without tortilla chips.  Buxton said he would have assumed that it is just eaten with a spoon.  We did have a great time at Topgolf, and I will happily return next year for the March Madness event.  There were quite a few golfers teeing off, but our four-some did not partake.  It seemed a bit overpriced for the driving range, but I guess you are paying for a nice atmosphere.  Thanks for having the MM party, and I hope you guys repeat the same promotion next year!  My only \"compliant\" is that for a few hours the bathroom did not have any soap.  Although this didn't bother Mr. Booth (he doesn't use soap), I found it odd.  I told management and they said they were working on it.  However, it seemed to take hours after they were notified.  I guess the soap store was closed for the day....",

We went on a Sunday morning and as soon as I walked in I knew I would love it too. This place is huge and modern, everything I would expect in Las Vegas. We were quickly checked in at the front counter and immediately given to a valet to show us around the facility and explain all the amenities to us before she showed us to our tee (area) As soon as we settled in to our own tee area we checked the ample menu and made some snack and drink orders before we tee'd up at the range. Each area had ample seating with a large coffee table, 2 full sets of golf clubs and 2 gas fired heaters. we were surrounded by t.v screens everywhere showing multiple NFL games including huge screens at the far end of the driving range. The range had a computer in which you input your player info and which kind of game you want to play and it automatically keeps score like in bowling. The food we had was actually pretty good, service was absolutely great and prices were not bad considering how much fun we had, but I can see this being a better time with a large group of friends. I just wish we had one in Los Angeles now, Aloha",

Since it was only the two of us it would have come out to about $80 per person for 2 hours. You really need 4 people to make it affordable. We did however play shuffleboard and listen to live music but nobody came to take our order for alcohol or food and we left. Please note this is quite a walk from MGM so check your map and be prepared",

As far as the golf, I am no pro and i thought it was super fun.  Prices are reasonable.  If you want to have a relax fun time with some food and drinks, this place is the spot. Would def. go again.",

    "text": "What a great concept. Why don't they have one of these in San Diego? Or are we? Hopefully it happens because this place is so much fun. For the avid golfer or for someone trying to find something fun to do. Top Golf is the ticket.  Three stories high with three levels and in each story level you can hit golf balls on a driving range with targets you can aim at through out. Full bar. Other games are there to play like corn hole, billiards, darts among others. They even have a swimming pool to use for the warmer days. For Vegas, that is perfect. Worried that you didn't bring your clubs. No worries. They have a full set for men and women to use and at no charge. Lefty? No problem. They have left handed sets to use as well. You can however bring your own clubs. Which is also nice. What you pay for is your time in your hitting area. Buying time allows you to hit unlimited golf balls which dispense out of a machine one at a time. So while you hit golf balls. You can eat and drink. Reminds me a lot like a bowling alley. Your just hitting golf balls instead of trying to hit bowling pins. My wife who isn't a golf fan or even joined me hitting golf balls. She enjoyed drinking a cocktail, watching a big screen TV and it was cold outside but had an outdoor heater to keep her warm. While I hit golf ball after golf ball. Perfect. Overall, a fun experience. I was able to practice a game I love while my wife was contently hanging out. Definitely a more relaxed atmosphere than your regular golfing range. A good way to bring in new players. Less intimidating as well as a cheap way to get introduced to the game of golf. I highly recommend coming and checking out Top Golf. An inexpensive time for family and friends. This place is a winner.",

There was a 2 hour wait for the 1st and 2nd floor bays.  We decided to reserve a 3rd floor bay as the wait time was only 30 min.  The cost was $45 an hour and the price would of been the same for a 1&2nd floor bay if we waited the 2 hours. The prices go up $10 at noon time.  Our host was courteous and lively.  We ordered a couple of drinks and some appetizers.  The nacho stack with grilled chicken and kalbi tacos.were surprisingly good.  There are TV Screens everywhere and your scoring screen even doubles as your personal tv.  We were able to watch the world cup match while playing. After we were done with our game we went downstairs and enjoyed playing shuffleboard and corn hole.  We had a great time.",

    "text": "I've been to Top Golf in Vegas a few times now that it has opened.  Every experience has been pretty awesome and yet so different at the same time.    I have been to hit some balls and try their food and drinks and that was awesome. The cost can add up pretty quickly, but it still seems to be a great value for the overall experience. The staff from start to finish was amazing and very helpful.  Next, I went to see a concert.  Soul Asylum!!  Yes, this venue also hosts live concerts.  The concert section was nice and small so we were able to easily see and hear the band from a few feet away.  It was amazing.  Then this last weekend we went to a Motley Brew craft beer event that was hosted on the 4th floor of Top Golf.  (On a separate note, Motley Brew events are pretty amazing themselves!) We were able to check out the entire 4th floor and hit a few balls while sampling various craft beers at the many pouring stations throughout.  All the servers/hosts were top notch and friendly, especially Kaylee who was super awesome and was pouring a great IPA brew.  So even if you just want a fresh and cool place to go hang out in Vegas, Top Golf is a great choice.  Even without doing the golf part, just watching sports on the big screens and having a beverage or three.  If their is a negative, I would say it is the parking situation.  It can get pretty backed up since it is Valet only, not just before, but the line to pick up your car can take a little while.  But the Valet crew is very friendly too and they are hustling, so it is what it is.",

I was excited when they opened up this one and finally got around to going last night.   My wife and 10 year old had come here with her girlfriend and her 10 year old last month and they had a great time! So now it was my turn...   Really cool atmosphere here. The DJ was streaming some great 90's and early 2K hip hop. Drinks were great! Service was on point. Sorry to read about Michael E.'s experience and I feel that they did a lot to improve on that. Even though it was crowded, I observed that the wait staff covered 3 Bays each, it seemed. Each were posted up in the center of the 3 bays they were in charge of. Our guy, Adam F., was polite courteous and attentive. We never had to look for him or ask one of his colleagues if he can come by to fulfill a request we had.   We came and were told of a 45 min wait @ around 9:30 PM. All good, we went towards the bar area to get some food and drinks then five mins. later we got the text saying a Bay opened up. Solid!   The food is subpar- yes, but I can see them stepping it up more in the future. We played 3 games there and had a great time! It was pricy, yes - but it is Vegas and I think plan on expecting it. It was worth it for us. I and we, plan on coming back in the near future for sure!",

It's a pricey place, but you come in expecting as much.  We enjoyed the game concept of it versus going to a golfing range, even though technically this is a glorified golfing range.  They provide the clubs and the balls.  The balls are tracked so you know where they land and depending on the game...they equate to a certain amount of points.  For locals or military, they have a discount...so don't forget to mention that to your server.  Or if you go earlier before noon...they also offer discounts.  We picked the tier 1 since we wanted minimal wait time, and less witnesses to our subpar golf skills.  Next time, I'd try the upper levels since they offer a better for view.  I would eat dinner before I get here, the food was mediocre at best.  We got the pork skewers as a snack...and they were as dry as jerky.  Probably best with a group of 4 if your only going for an hour, any additional people and you won't get to hit too many balls.",

Parking was impossible on a Wednesday late afternoon, valet closed, I was told to park at the adjacent MGM public parking which I did and walked towards topgolf building. It felt like I walked 1/4 mile. Not happy about the parking!!!!   I'm still giving this place a 5 star for total well thought out entertainment, the open booths they call golf bay is where you rent the space hourly and prices varies depending at the time of check in. The golf bay feels like you're in your backyard swinging your clubs in an open space and lounging  around on a modern L shape couch and a big coffee  table enough for everyone to sit around and have drinks and appetizers. You don't have to be a golfer to enjoy this type of entertainment.   A set of golf clubs is provided in your bay. Since I'm a lefty, they  provided the club set right away. This is a driving range taken to the next level of pure fun! Just like bowling, it has golf monitors that keeps track of your range and distance. You see colored distance targets, Huge tv screens across the field, color lighted posts around the driving range, I'm sitting here in an open space  a/c blowing cool air overhead just made me forget the summer heat in Vegas. It was comfortable.  There's four levels of pure fun and entertainment, it has a pool and bar for private parties and the rest is for you to come out and discover this amazing place!   The staff are always around to assist if you need something. The appetizers we had tonight was a couple of flat bread pizza (looks homemade and tasted fresh), delicious chicken burrito cut up in 2\" slices. Food was plated neatly, and surprisingly the food here is delicious. We had seconds of the same thing.  OVERALL:  great food,  pure entertainment and fun concept, pricey ( be prepared to spend big bucks) gets crowded, beautiful outdoor lighting at night,    parking needs to improve ASAP!!! Use Uber or Lyft!!! I'm definitely a big fan of this place! Yes, one of my go to places for entertainment.",

Tbh, I had no idea what to expect at first, but I was blown away! This is def the perfect place for a party or fun \"team building\" time, even if not everyone is great with a golf club (like myself.)  Upon arrival, you can either valet your car for cheap or park in the front lot as long as there's space - Mind you, we came on a Sunday night (aka the first football Sunday of the season as well as the night Drake is in town) around 9:30/10:00 PM and there was still lots of parking available. There is also a shuttle that comes to/from the MGM, so you could park there as well - although I'm not not sure if parking is still free there or not... (probably not.)  This place is the love child of a day/nightclub and a driving range. Loud music, neon lights, bottle service, and 4 stories to tee off of. There's even a pool (with a swim-up bar, huge-screen tv, & lounge chairs that are partially submerged) that you can chill out in during the day.  The food and drink menu is pretty impressive as well. We all ordered a little bit of everything: Backyard-style wings, grilled edamame, 3 different kinds of pizza, a hoity-toity meat & cheese platter... They were all so good! Def worth the prices because their flavors were fantastic. The drinks were a'flowin' as well. The waiters tending to us were quick on their feet and eager to help too, which is awesome realizing how needy/hungry we all were.  This place does come with a hefty price tag, so I won't be coming here often... which is why I put 4 stars, but I do plan on coming back eventually!! My friends and I would have so much fun here!!",

In my opinion the staff in the waiting area are the best however they keep a cute staff of girls serving in the actual driving range areas.  If your really into that no matter what,  you'll enjoy this experience.  If the girl Nikki at the lounge area had stayed with us through out the experience I would have probably given this place a perfect 5 out of 5 which I rarely give however they switched is over to a Barbie with little interest in her guest in my opinion an even less personality or ability to make suggestions or recommendations that could increase your experience.  Regardless this place has a good enough process to ensure everyone leaves happy.  I would definitely recommend to any group.",

Ky was helpful with explaining how everything works, Eva/Lucy were AWESOME, very attentive and checking up on us to make sure we were taken care of. I am happy to say that I will be back for the golfing experience but not so sure abt the bar..   Btw, we ended up leaving a great tip for Eva :)  ================================  I'm here on a mini vacay from Cali.. Heard of this place opened a while back, thought I check it out.  Be advised.. I know its summer in Vegas but with no ceiling fans, it does get a bit hot. Be prepared to play naked!! lol  I came here with 2 buddies on a Sunday. If Im gonna spend $60/hr to hit a few golf balls I expect good service. We had to wait for a spot to open up, so we went to an almost empty bar on the main floor. We sat there for 7 mins (I started a timer) as I watched 2 other groups get served b4 us and still no drinks. We decided to leave the bar.  Will update after if service improves. I mentioned to our host Eva abt our experience.. I guess the tips will go to her instead..",

For a party of 6 it came about $20 each, not including any drink, food or additional time.  Here's the problem...everything is timed. It's based on hourly price. If you come in early it's not as expensive, the later you show up to drive the more expensive it is. The customer service is ok. The bar service is ok. Yes, the food and drinks are on the high end (not the \"buying a brand\", more along the lines of Red Robin prices and higher) If you can tolerate the Vegas heat and swing, more power to you. Outdoors is more of a spring/fall sport, which TopGolf falls into.",

They also stage for live bands and trendy comfortable sitting areas. It's great for groups because the pricing is typical Vegas! Definitely caters to golfing enthusiasts and sports fans.   $8 for beers is not bad for Vegas but $60 for an hour is kinda pricey for the first and second levels during the afternoon. I have not hit golf balls for longest time so I was shanking balls. My experience would be better if they had staff to improve your swing.",

    "text": "I'm having a hard time rating  Topgolf in Las Vegas. The same time last year I hosted a group of clients and had a great time. This year on 7/1, took out the same clients, had a wonderful time again. They treated us well and our service was awesome. My brother-in-law was in town as well and I recommend Topgolf for a family outing and we went back on 7/6, great time again. Now here is the problem, my wife and I own a dance studio, we are in Las Vegas to compete at a National Dance Competition. We wanted to celebrate with our instructors on a successful week of competition. They all wanted to go TopGolf because they've been hearing great things about it and  it is connected to the MGM where we were staying. On 7/7 @ 9PM we had a reservation for seven or eight people. When we arrived our hostess/waitress wasn't very friendly, not rude but not what I experienced from other hostess on prior visits. She didn't explain anything to our instructors or how things worked with the games. Maybe we caught her on a off night, but whatever, we were there to have a good time. We ordered food and drinks, everything at the start is fine, but I notice our waitress ignoring our group as she walked by multiple times even when they raised their hands to get her attention. My instructors had to start moving plates/glasses and cleaning the table for themselves and trying to find something to wipe their hand on before they pick up a club when it was their turn to hit because there were no napkins on the table ( btw most of Topgolf's menu is finger foods) and she hadn't checked on our party in a very long time. The place wasn't particularly busy that night but still empty bottles, plates, and drinks weren't being cleared off our area. So when she walked by and didn't see our people call to her again, that was it. I pulled her aside and told her she sucked at waitressing and I wanted a new waitress. She of course didn't understand why, so I told her about her lack of service but I also wasn't in the mood to argue so I just I wanted another waitress and to see her manager. A new waitress came but no manager??? The service improved though. Ok good, back to having a good time... as long as my people were having fun, not getting the manger involved I would let pass. When it came to settle the bill, to my surprise the old waitress wanted close us out. Alright, maybe she started the process and the billing system needed her to close the ticket. On the bill I wrote the $100 gratuity goes to the new waitress that gave us great service. Immediately after she ran my ticket she had one of the other employees shut down our game without giving us warning. As far as our group's behavior, we were mild, fun loving, polite as they come. So it was the most bizarre scenario. I directly went and talked to George Kalianiotis the Team Lead and Tiffany Hietbrink the Hospitality Manager about the actions of their vengeful waitress. To both their credit they really tried to make the situation better. But the damage was done and ended our celebratory night at Topgolf on a sour note. By no means am I high roller but if you drop close to $1000 in couple hours you should get at least the same service that you would get from an IHOP. Tiffany and George both gave me their personal card, refunded me back $150 and promised to treat our party right the next time we're in town. I will hold them up to that promise and change my rating then to 5 stars which they deserve except for the action of a waitress having a off night.

I am so glad I found Top Golf Las Vegas. Once I arrived I saw they offered golf lessons by professional instructors. So I scheduled with the training director Sean Solodovnick. I am relatively new to golf and wanted to rid of all my bad habits I picked up since starting. From the first few swings with Sean's adjustments I could fell the difference in my body mechanics. I went from tight and choppy to lose and smooth in an hour. It went so well I came back a few days later to see him again. Sean made learning the game of golf fun and interesting. He made a difficult task (golf swing) simpler to understand. Sean showed me what was causing my slice, which I could not change on my own. I couldn't be happier with my experience with him. I will definitely be seeing him again and Top Golf my next time in town.",

    "text": "Top Golf in Las Vegas is unlike any other golf experience you may have experienced. It's location alone is perfect. Located right behind planet Hollywood makes it an easy to walk from the strip or a quick Uber drive. In my opinion it's best to go at dusk when all the lights of the strip are illuminated. You are in the heart of the strip while you play golf making for a spectacular ambience. This is a great place for families, date nights, Bachelor parties, or large gatherings with friends. If there is a sports game, match, or fight on this would also be an amazing place to come and view it because they have multiple TVs for your viewing pleasure. Including a ginormous wall projection located in the middle of the place and easily seen from mult levels. Not only can you play an array of golf games but you can also play bean bag games, table tennis or even take a quick dip in the pool. There is something for everyone in your party. Top golf even serves out killer food and drinks. For those 21 and over I highly recommend the frozen Moscow mule! It's delicious and ideal for fighting the Vegas heat. If you're hungry grab the chicken Boursin bacon flatbread, pulled pork sliders or the House marinated steak kabobs. You'll be blown away by quality of the food. I'm a local and have visited this establishment many times and have always had a beyond pleasant experience, great service, and outstanding dining. If you're looking for a good time while in town make sure to stop by top golf Las Vegas!!",

We stayed for an hour in the 3rd floor. $60 + $5 membership fee per player. Got 3 drinks. Total was roughly $100.  The bay allows for up to 6 players, so you can minimize cost that way, but that just means less golf time per player.",

I tried to reserve a bay for a bachelor party and for over a week no-one answered the phone or returned messages. When I went in to make the reservation in person, the fees were crazy. Reservations were limited to level 3 & 4, a bay fee of $105 per hour (that is the peak hour fee & is $10 more than the posted walk-in rates) with a $250-350 F&B minimum depending on who you talk to. On top of that, they charge an extra 7% service charge on your bill for using a reserved bay! That's crazy!  Obviously decided to forgo the reservation and just had one of the people in our group volunteer to come earlier to put our name down for a bay. Ended up getting our bay after waiting a little over an hour. The servers at the Birdie Bar were fantastic in taking our orders and transferring them to our bay once we got one. Once we got to our bay, the staff was just as great. The food was better than we expected and like I said earlier, the experience once we got past the front was 5 stars.",

We walked up with no reservation and had a slot on level one within 15 minutes. It was fun. I will be going back and in fact I will probably be hosting future events for a group of my Vegas Bros.  I brought my own driver and used the house provided drivers for our chipping game.  Our server Jewell was the best. She really stood out for her attentiveness and her sincere friendliness plus she laughed at my jokes. She is why I gave you 5 stars when it should have been 4 stars based on the following:  108 climate-controlled hitting bays - There are these vents slightly behind the booth blowing air. Not cold air. Just air. I asked a number of the staff why the air was not cold and was told it was hit or miss. And the excuse that the air was warm because it is hot out is the wrong answer. Of course it is hot out, it's Vegas in the summer. Please define \"climate controlled\". Needs to be cold air. #HVAC  I think TopGolf needs to have a locals discount. You are making plenty of money off of tourists. If you want more locals to return more often, $28 pitchers of beer does not cut it or at least offer locals hitting bay discounts during non-peak times.",

    "text": "A new way to enjoy drinking and games! They've taken the driving range to another level. It's like ordering bottle service and challenging your friends on the driving range. You play by points on where the ball lands in these lit up circles. You get this incredible view of Vegas and you get to golf it up. This place gets really popular at night. So be prepared to wait. The 3rd floor also has cabanas and a pool to swim. It still has some kinks to work out but it's still fun nonetheless. I would recommend this place for a fun drinking activity with a group of friends.",

He somehow knew the card my friend was thinking of before she said it! He blew our minds. The drinks were really tasty and the server was very attentive to our table. The wings were delicious. I definitely can not wait to go back.",

    "text": "Touchdown!? Errr... I have zero love for the actual game of golf, but get me in a driving range and I'm having a blast. Topgolf is truly the ultimate driving range with multiple targets within the range that capture your yardage and speed.   4 levels high, this massive play house is balls of fun! You enter on the second level where you check-in. We got super lucky, as I have heard many a horror story about the massive weight times. I would HIGHLY RECOMMEND calling ahead. We waited about 10 minutes and then received a text that our golf bay was ready. Prices are per hour and vary by the time you arrive and which level you would like to be on, obviously nighttime and the higher levels are more mula! There is also a one-time $5 per person for a Topgolf Lifetime Membership. I'm in the club, baby!!  The 4th level is a private event space with a private pool. We opted for the 3rd level because YOLO. The 3rd level has a private bar and a pool. This level is cool because it can please a whole crowd, some can be at the pool and some can be at hitting balls-- you can easily go back and forth. Typically the pool on level 3 is $30/person to use, but if you are spending mad money at your table and it isn't CRAZY busy at the pool-- they are pretty cool about letting you in. There is about 6 cabanas surrounding the pool that you can rent, 3 of which \"overlook\" Wet Republic.   Similar to bowling, your group gets their own \"lane.\" They call it a \"golf bay,\" I like to call it a golf cabana because it sounds fancy. We had 5 people, but I think you could fit 8-10 in a lane. Your golf cabana contains 2 TVs (one with your golf scores + one with sports), a sectional couch, a table, space to put your own clubs, the Topgolf clubs that are offered to you (for men and women), the grass patch with tees and the machine that spits out the balls. A host walked us to the golf cabana and explained the process. They really push the \"No Happy Gilmoring.\" You are then handed off to a server who can get your food and drink orders. I had a frozen Ketle One moscow mule and it was perfection. #STRONG  There are multiple games you can play within the targets on the range. You start by waving your club in front of the ball machine sensor and poof-- your ball. You get 20 balls per person per game. However, you can complete multiple games in an hour. We played for 2 hours and it felt too long. haha But, that might just be me. The screen will tell you how far and fast you hit the ball ONLY if you make it in a target. There are 4 big targets and another 4 small ones.   I can see the appeal of this place and I enjoyed watching friends who love golf getting excited. However, personally if this was near my house-- it wouldn't be my go-to place. It is expensive and while fun, I think there are better places to have fun for the price. With that being said, it is definitely worth at least one trip.   The parking/taxi/valet situation can be a shit-show and is something I think still needs to be worked out at this location.",

The drinks and food are decently priced. I had a golf bag drink, tastes good and the injectable doughnut holes, interesting concept, choose your flavor and you put as much filling in them as you'd like.  There are free games around while you wait like corn hole and Jenga. They have multiple levels. 2 levels have a pool on them and I was another level with a dj and dance area.",

Summer is still a great time to visit if you don't mind the heat. I suggest night golfing if you want to avoid the sun. There's 3 levels of golf, a pool area during the day, and gaming. The main floor has two huge TV's. We loved it for a place to go watch sports and lounge. It's can be a friendly spot for families as well! This venue is a great spot-unfortunately, the service isn't what I hoped. Otherwise, i would give Top Golf a 5 Star review.",

It's a nice low key spot if you want to have a few drinks and good food while working on your swing, I've heard the line can be some what of a wait (2+hrs) so if you have a group of 5 or more I'd suggest just everyone pitching in and getting the cabana area on the 3rd level. My favorite server would have to be Andi she was super sweet and always came to check up on us to see if we were OK. The BBQ platter is a must try and seasonal parfait is a great dessert item too! But the best dessert is the injectable cinnamon ball things, they can get messy but worth it. Security can be a little touchy but I guess they kind of have to be up tight since there's alcohol involved balls and metal clubs...",

    "text": "This place sucks. It has such a big hype for nothing. Their drinks come in plastic cups..... But the kind that makes your drink taste disgusting. Even just an ice water is nasty. Beer is pretty much served warm. Who wants to drink a warm beer?  There's hidden fees. They are very deceiving when giving out info. Customer service is whack!  Here we go: We planned to come here for my bro in law's bday. My sister was having such a hard time calling to get info on if we should or even could make reservations or not.  Even customer service on the phone sucked. We couldn't get solid answers for anything.  We ended up just showing up and getting on the wait list. We had about 10 people expected to come. My sister ask 1 girl how big each bay was... The girl showed her how big and she was pretty satisfied about it....... Until we got seated and it wasn't nearly as big as the girl told her! It was actually about half the size!  It was $75/HR for that half bay which could supposedly sit 10 people. (Yeah, if we sit on each other's laps!!!). We sat down and found out that each person has to pay an additional $5 if they want to golf.. I get it, it's only $5. BUT why didn't anyone tell us this from the beginning?   We spoke to so many people and no one mentioned extra fees to play.  Sooooo you pretty much just reserve a spot in front of a golf ball and golf clubs BUT you can't actually play until you pay more than the $75/HR you're already paying. Then we ordered drinks..... They showed us the drink menu and we almost got the bottle service. As we were sitting to discuss we had a server (Eva I think? And some other guy..) we couldn't even really discuss amongst ourselves if we wanted the bottle service because 2 people in the group were trying to sign up to play with one of the workers (and pay their extra $5) and the rest of us were debating on the drinks. Ultimately, it was the approach of the workers that made it feel disorganized.  They stood there and stared as we tried to decide. I had to tell them that we needed a minute so they could get out of our faces. We later decided to order our drinks.  They came out fairly quickly but again.. They were all WARM. The prices are through the roof at this place. Yes, it's a gorgeous view and pretty cool atmosphere, but most definitely not worth any of the cost what so ever. My husband ordered chicken wings that everyone could share but we didn't get any plates. We just had to pass around the serving dish and eat out of it until we could flag our waitress down for some plates. When it came closer to our hour they asked if we wanted to extend for an extra hour. By that time our mood was at the point of annoyed and we tried to figure out if we should go somewhere else. We had about EIGHT minutes left in the hour.. We were told if we don't decide if we want to extend the hour we have to move all our stuff and finish the rest of our food somewhere on the side of the building. Are. You. Kidding. Me?!! The absolute WORST service ever!  Whoever is in charge of training the staff should be terminated immediately. They have absolutely no idea what is going on, they do not know how to answer questions, or they're all just idiots. Oh! To end the night off we had to wait 837363836374 hours for our car in valet. (Which by the way is your only option to park unless you want to walk from MGM.) Top golf...  You're a joke.",

    "text": "My private lesson at Topgolf was amazing! This was my first (real) time golfing. I had been to topgolf two other times but literally had no idea what I was doing. I just grabbed a club and swung. My fiance loves to golf, and he wanted me to love it too. That way, we could do it together. So, he bought me a private lesson for my birthday ($99 cost). It was so worth it.   My instructor was Brandon Johnson. He is a top-notch instructor. In one hour, he turned my swing-and-miss to a real swing of which I can be proud, especially for a beginner. Brandon did a great job explaining things in a way that clicks. He didn't overcomplicate things, he broke it down to chewable details, and built a great foundation for my golfing future. My favorite thing about Brandon's coaching style is that he could easily explain to me what I did on each shot form-wise that led to the ball going different ways. Furthermore, the nice thing was that I brought my new club set (another birthday gift), and so I was able to practice on my own clubs.   I highly recommend hiring Brandon as your instructor. It was such a great experience. My fiance was able to hang out (sipping sangria) and watch my lesson in our booth area. Topgolf's fun atmosphere is the best place to get started for a newbie.  I can't wait to go back!",

When we arrived we gave our name at the front desk and they said they would text is when our spot was ready. We were told about 30 min. An hour went by, so we went to the front desk. They said they texted us 30 min in, but we never received it, and we did verify the phone number. I don't know why they just don't announce your name over the loud speaker. A simple system made complicated.  Finally we get to our spot and settle in. It was a little loud, but the attendant gave us a good amount of info. The balls are tracked and scored by radar. The attendant told us the different games are in the menu book. The games were listed but the rules and instructions were not. It was very hard to figure out on our own. The computer does not give you the objectives, it just tells you when its your turn.   The clubs in each spot are labeled mens and womens. Mens clubs are longer with steel shafts while the womens are shorter with graphite shafts. They were in good shape and clean. The balls are released by covering a laser eye. The roll out onto the mat, if you want to tee it up you have to do it yourself. You pay by the hour so you can hit as many balls as you can crank out in the time period. You can add more time as you go right from the computer screen.  My biggest gripe, besides waiting longer than we should have, is that the radar didn't away work. Sometimes it didnt score the shot correctly and sometimes is didnt read the ball at all. If the radar worked as it should, we all would have had a much better time.  All in all we had a good time. Each area had a fan and a water mister so it wasnt too hot, and the cold air duct with push out some cold air on intervals to help with the heat. The bar service was prompt and friendly. Make sure you ask lots of questions about the computer system.",

Don't get me wrong, it's fun for any level of golfer, but you're not taking your time and getting $5 buckets here. Overall, a great night out with (competitive) friends. Emphasis on night out.

Every other day was booked with private events, even the day we went they only had the first floor available. The third floor is for adults only but luckily there were no kids where we were playing. Our wait was an hour and a half which was fine because they have so much you can do while you wait. They have games to play, plenty of huge tv's to watch, plenty of places to lounge with optional heaters. The staff here is very helpful and friendly, they explained everything to us thoroughly. Their prices are pretty high, we played for an hour which was good since it was just two of us. They do give you options to buy more time in 30 minute increments. The drinks were strong and the food was good. The short rib tacos were flavored well and the injectable donut holes were also pretty strong, lol. You will have to pay a one time membership fee of five dollars and if you complete a first time survey they will give you a discount for a future visit. Since they are starting to pop up in more states we will definitely be returning because it's really a good time with a group or just a date night.",

Somehow I was charged for an extra half an hour of play and I didn't notice it at the time I paid the bill.  I will definitely come back. They could have told me too bad. I mean, honestly they are constantly busy and me not coming 3-4 times a year wouldn't hurt their business at all. It says something that they saw my review, reached out, and made it right. I had a great time there, my server Kristi was awesome, and it was fun just blasting balls off the second floor.  Glad I can return without a chip on my shoulder!",

My friend asked for a glass she never brought it so they went to the bar themselves and got it because she was busy talking to her co-worker right behind our table. Anyways ordered the food, food comes out it was a little cold could we tell her no because she didn't come back and check on us once, beers gone... annoyed we asked for the check thank god I had a gift card that we used for this adventure because I would have been pissed if I spent $117",

    "text": "First time at Top Golf and I loved it. And especially the Vegas location- from what I gather this is like the Top Golf to top all Top Golfs (see what I did there?) But seriously - sports books and slots if you want to gamble. Live music almost every day. Massive tv screens. And three floors worth of golfing + drinking + eating goodness to enjoy.   Expect a wait - we waited around an hour and a half. But you can put your name down and leave or just hang out and drink. So it's really not too bad. I'm not super into golf but the fact that the ball just spits right out makes it so easy to want to swing for an hour or so. After that it got a little boring. My fiance is a pretty intense golfer and could have probably paid to stay all day but around an hour was plenty of time. Plus it adds up. Price is something like a dollar a minute. But hey, money is better spent here than it is at the tables. They have a large food and drink menu and each bay has waiter service so you can continue to order while you play. Each bay also has a tv ! We didn't eat but the food around us looked dope.   If you are into golf + sports betting this is basically one of the happiest places on earth for you. These are two of my fiance's favorite things and he was like a kid in a candy store. Make sure to stop on by if you are looking for something different to do while in Vegas!",

The food that we ordered was just ok, nothing too special about it. It might not be the best place to eat, but it is a great place to celebrate birthdays! It's nice that you have your is area with a comfy couch and table that you can order drinks and food from, while playing golf without purchasing a table/getting bottle service like you have to do at a club. We didn't get any birthday package or anything, but I went up to get shots for the group to celebrate my boyfriends birthday at 12am. I went up to the bar a few minutes before 12, ordered, and asked if they could deliver the drinks at 11:59pm as a surprise. I didn't expect them to do anything extra and it was really nice of them to do that for me! They brought it out at exactly 11:59 like I asked and even threw in the happy birthday sign with flashing lights to make it even more special and celebratory! I didn't ask for this at all so it was really nice of them to do this since I  wasn't buying a bottle or anything. Ruben was the host who brought out the drinks and the sign and he was awesome!! We also got some complimentary donut holes for his birthday! Thank you Topgolf and Ruben, for making my boyfriend's birthday an amazing one!",

    "text": "Whether you're a complete newbie or a seasoned golfer, TopGolf is a ton of fun.    THE SETUP:  TopGolf is basically a three-level driving range with a variety of targets and with big screens (like the size they have at a large arena or stadium) showing sports on the far side.  Each bay has an l-shaped seating area, a table, TVs coordinated to track your drives, and the actual golfing area which has an automatic ball machine and a full set of clubs (lefty clubs are available by request).  Each pair of bays face each other.   As each bay accommodates 6 golfers, groups of up to 12 can use two side-by-side bays.    PRICING: The golfing is actually pretty inexpensive.  If you go midweek and before noon, you can get a bay for as cheap as $30/hour (plus a $5 member fee for each person).  Friday/Saturday nights can go for as much as $90/hour.  You can find discount vouchers from the booth in the lobby of the MGM, and don't need to do full hour increments (we ended up golfing for an hour and a half).    FOOD/DRINK:  Food and drink are really the way TopGolf makes its money.  Beers start at $7 each and bottle service starts at $300.  The best values are getting Beer for the Bay ($24 beers for $150) and getting shareable platters rather than individual dishes.  Our group came for breakfast/brunch and shared the street taco platter ($75) and the fruit platter ($65).  The food was much fresher and better than expected especially the carnitas tacos, and came with grilled onions, chips, salsa, pickled vegetables, peppers, and guacamole.  I also enjoyed the manmosa (Blue Moon, prosecco, and OJ) for $10.  You can spend a ton of money here but you don't have to.",

The biggest issue I found, as a local, is that they do not have valet car service. Finding parking is incredibly difficult, if not impossible, on a busy night. They tell you to go parking at MGM which I think is ridiculous. Therefore, if you are going to come here, doing a cab or Uber/ Lyft is a good idea. Everyone says the inside is gorgeous. The inside is average. It's just OK. I actually found it somewhat basic and boring. We were in a party where there was a buffet ordered of pastas, salad, and also a few starters in the barbecue realm. This was behind the seat/couches we were on, and it was very difficult to eat. We found it very inefficient. If you love golf, I guess you'll really like this place. I am not a huge fan so everything else has to wow me and it did not. Drinks also average.  Glad I came and saw. Would not push to come back. Way better places in Vegas with better deals and better fun.",

I love that I can see a comedy show here for such a great price too.   Once we got inside, we were seated by a hostess with long black hair and she was so nice (forgot her name), if she could be recognized I would really appreciated it. We saw Benji on the Friday , his opening night.  They offer you a food menu and a drink menu. I wish I would have known because we ate before, but now we know for next time.   Get there early if you want to have a good seat because it's kind of limited and it's all long dining tables so it works better if you're coming with friends.   This place is awesome! Please continue to book great acts like Benji!!",

Not only did we wait over an hour for nachos but our wait staff only came by once in a two hour period. Then there was an event tent set up so we had to park at mgm and walk with signs at top golf saying they would validate our ticket for free parking. We did what was asked and got the ticket validated however the mgm garage staff wanted to charge us 15.00 for parking stating there were only two options....one to pay or the other to go through as a no pay which flags the license plate. This is the worst experience as a local that I've ever had and the second horrible experience I've had at this top golf location. We WILL NOT return. Which I know they don't care because they just care about getting their money.  This email is a service from Topgolf. [R5OKRE-ME5R]",

The place is pretty big with plenty of space to pass the time by playing shuffleboard, corn hole, or just watching some sports from their many TVs along with the bar. The atmosphere was great.   The golfing part was also very fun as they had many game options to play and everyone in my group, both beginners and amateurs, all had a great time. I will say it could have been better if our bay was more centered because being on the edge bay made it somewhat harder to aim the ball.  Staff members are exceptional and were a big plus in the overall experience. The beer selections are plenty and the food snacks were way better than I was expecting!  The difference in price between playing mid-morning and late afternoon and later is noticeable, and I would definitely recommend playing in the morning so then you can do other Late Night Vegas activities =) .",

This was my first time checking it out and I was impressed by the sheer size of it. Sure, it's pretty cool hitting some golf balls while lounging in your own personal bay with food and beverage service. But there are so many other things things you can do even if you don't know how to swing a golf club. Most surprisingly, the food that we tried was actually pretty good and a notch above your typical bar food.  My only complaint is the generic Top Golf clubs that they provide. I get that they can't offer actual nice clubs for all the drunk/beginner action that they see, but these things were like janky little junior sets you'd find at KMart. Not that it really matters after 2 or 5 drinks. Good times.",

    "text": "Top golfs have been blowing up everywhere and this was the third time I've actually been to the one in Las Vegas. The main reason for going was it was the celebration for our friends birthday party so we reserved six bays. Note,  when you reserve a bay you want to be in the middle and possibly off the ground floor, unfortunately, this time our party was 201-206 which if you know Topgolf means the far left corner on the second floor. The catered food was sat out for us which include a barbecue brisket mac & cheese links chicken wings and some other sides to complement the meal which I believe were nachos and chips  The staff members helping us we're pretty good as far as getting us anything as well as securing beverages for us but we really didn't get a chance to enjoy the game as much as I hope because we were in the far corner. If you like swinging, hitting from the far corner and hitting certain targets is a lot harder than it is when you're in the center of the Top Golf.   The other thing that wasn't so great was that as a frequent top golf member I couldn't add myself (my profile) because it was set up as a group event. But I struggled a bit with that because I've done that in the past for other groups and been able to modify and add my profile.   Overall a decent experience but I think they're so much more Las Vegas to do. If you don't have a Topgolf near you then yes I would definitely recommend going because the vibe is cool & the swimming pool upstairs is dope. It's a nice addition to have and the location is not far from the strip, but not a place to really put in work and party. More of a pit stop before you get into some real shenanigans! Drinks are pricey and not strong (made by the book). Worth coming back again with a group but lots of other activities to consider.",

    "text": "This place is crazy fun with so much to do. BUT like everything else in Vegas, expect to be spending quite a bit to get the whole experience.   Boyfriend and I have always wanted to go to Top Golf, but the closest one to us is in Roseville , CA that is 2 hours away from us. But since we were in Vegas and not doing anything that day, we decided to go here.   It was a Saturday & it's summer so we knew it was going to be a little bit crowded and prices were going to be a little up there. At first if you are on the website and looking to reserve a bay, it may say its sold out , so assuming because it was Saturday, summer, being in Vegas , I would look ahead of time on the website if you want to reserve a bay.   BUT most of the time they do have walk in bays set aside for all the walk ins that come in , which is really convenient being that we didn't even think we were going to be able to go to Top Golf anymore because of the website.   We arrived there around 2ish and it was actually pretty busy with tons of people still walking in. The line wasn't bad at all though it just looked super busy. The desk ladies let us know that bays on the 1-2 floor were about an 30min-1 hour wait and if you wanted to go to the 3rd floor it was an hour and a half. We decided to just do the 1-2 floor since it was just our first time.   Prices also vary from times that you go in , on a Saturday from afternoon-5pm it's about $77 per hour and after 8pm it was around $80 per hour. If you look online it can tell you dates on the weekdays which are a bit cheaper.   My boyfriend, friends and I waited pretty much less than 30 minutes and we already got to our bay which was still beautiful with the Vegas strip right behind it , which I'm sure is even more beautiful at night with all the lights.   The guy pretty much explained everything for us from which golf clubs are for the ladies, which ones are for the guys, and how to put all the information we need for the game. The servers were great too and very efficient with serving us right away with water , drinks, and any food we decided to get during our game.   I decided to get the Sunrise burger and stuffed donuts. The Sunrise burger was really good ,but not something I would exactly hype but still good. The real excitement was for the stuffed donuts since you got the chance to stuff them on your own with the syringes that came with vanilla and chocolate. It was a little messy since it is 100 degrees outside but honestly if you are at Top Golf , I feel like the stuffed donuts were one of the things on the menu to def try while there.   Overall the whole experience was fun and quite relaxing on a Saturday afternoon. Good music, fun game, good food, and good people to be around with.   The only thing I probably advise while going here is to go with a group of friends and to keep in mind of how pricy it can get when playing the game. Which we ended up paying a total of around $200 for an hour and half split between 4 of us. So it Top Golf is def a place to go with a big group of friends. (At least 6 of you to play)   I'm assuming it would be different at the Roseville location , but still plan on going for my boyfriends birthday now since he loves this place.",

    "text": "Great experience at this fully serviced driving range. You can choose from 3 levels (first 2 levels are one price, 3rd level is a bit more). Your assigned \"bay\" comes complete with comfy couches, assortment of clubs (men's and women's), touch screens to operate the different games/score keeper, a menu with drinks and food, a wonderful server, and most importantly on 40 degree (C) days like today, fans and misters!  Golf balls are dispensed automatically, with a wave of your club, and depending on where your ball lands in the various targets (almost like a dartboard system) you get different points based on that. If you swing for the fences and hit the back wall (in the centre), you get mega points!  Great place to hang out with friends/family, entertain clients, etc. Definitely check this place out!",

You can practice or choose one of many games. The balls have chips that measure distance, speed, curve, etc. Water mist fills the air in your space since you hit from outside. A TV screen keeps track of all players scores, similar to a bowling chart. Several restaurants have food and craft beers. A pool is on the top floor to extend your par-tee. A gift shop has nice clothes and trinkets.",

    "text": "Super fun place to test out your golfing skills!  A nice addition to the Vegas strip since it provides an extra alternative to gambling or dayclubbing in 100 degree heat in the summer. Uber would be easiest to get here, but they have shuttles running from MGM also.  If you're concerned about hourly rates, it's best to check their rates schedule. Weekdays before noon are cheapest for the first 2 floors. We arrived on a Thursday at 11:30am. They said it would be a 30 minute wait for the first 2 floors, or we could go up to the top floor. It would've been the same price anyway so up we went. The top floor is nicer anyway because there are no kids, and the view is better. We got stationed at one of the bays on the very end, so it was a weird angle to play at.  The actual golfing was fun though! They have all kinds of clubs for you to use. There are different types of games also, but we just stuck with the basic one. Our first hour went by super fast because no one had golfed before so we took forever. We added an extra hour, which I thought was a bit overkill. I started getting really tired of golf by 90 min, but did enjoy watching others hit and cheering them on.  They have an extensive menu if you want to order drinks or food. There is also a pool and cornhole in the non golfing areas.  The price isn't too bad if you're mindful. Extra hours, food, and drinks could make your final bill very large. But if you're in Vegas, you're probably willing to splurge for a good time!",

The thing that really put me off was on my last visit I had a $10 off voucher as well as I have the M Life Military card.  As I wasn't sure what the Top Golf discount was I asked our server what would be the better discount off our $300 bill.  She didn't blink and said the $10 voucher was the better discount.  Found out later the discount for military is 10%.  You do the math but our server was wrong or just didn't care enough to check.  So they advertise the M Life for Veterans but did nothing to back it up.  Even after I filled out the survey after.  Not a peep back from Top Golf.",

It had monitors to watch the ball as the ball is tracked n scored for points to hit targets.  Tv screens are everywhere.  Music plays throughout the venue.  Clubs are included included left handed clubs upon requests.    The back drop of the range is the Vegas strip with tons of neon lights.  The tees and targets are lite nicely in neon lights.  The range n grass look so good that it looks fake with the lighting and Vegas background. Go during sunset or night.  It's worth it.   If you can't golf, don't worry about it, it's a great time for all.  Kids have a blast!  Try to hit the ball, laugh with friends, drink a cocktail, n eat good food.  Great times!",

Also, we had to wait about 45 minutes to get a spot at our bay on 3rd floor, but it seemed that there were a lot of bays open when we got there. Not sure if it was crowded before and everyone just left all at once, but maybe they reserve some for others?  Once we got to the bay, it took about 30 minutes for someone to take our order for drinks. We stayed about 2 hours and our waitress only checked in on us twice. She even forgot one of our drinks. Lastly, our bill came out to $280 and we gave our waitress $300, and she saint even give us change back. She rudely just assumed that the rest was her tip without even asking us. Our experience would've been so much better if service was better.",

We went as a couple, but each bay (that you rent by the hour) holds up to 6 people, so you could do a family or friend group. We had a lot of fun with just the two of us sharing a bay, as we then could get a lot of golf in one right after the other. The night we were there, *TONY* (huge shout out) was our host, taking us to our bay, introducing us to the venue, explaining the equipment and the available \"games,\" showing us how to use the (very very easy) computer screen to keep score, etc. He did such a great job, even including some tips to level the playing field, since my husband is an expert golfer and I am barely a golfer at all. Needless to say, we had an incredible time (due in huge part to Tony's introduction and advice), and we will greatly look forward to returning when we come back to town. There was a huge private event there that night with hundreds of guests, which blocked 2 of the 4 floors from public play, but the only affect this had on our experience was a minor mix-up with a service-person not coming by to take our refresher-drink orders (which was no big deal, as the bar was literally steps from our bay) and check us out when we were done; not to worry, though, as Tony met us as we finished and took care of the oversight post haste. GO! You'll love it!",

    "text": "My husband and I had been here once before and enjoyed it the first time and thought to start coming here weekly to relax and get out to the strip since we are locals and usually avoid the area.  Our most recent visit here was absolutely unacceptable. It was a Friday night and we had a bay on level 3 which was $90 an hour. We had 4 people total and 3/4 had memberships (in order to golf you must have a membership, if you do not have one, it is $5). We stayed for about an hour and a half and had drinks and food. When our bill came, we were charged for 4 memberships even though we only signed 1 person up for a membership. Upon noticing this and asking for this to be corrected, they stated that they had already run our card and that the only way to refund us would be to void the charge and charge it again for the correct amount. HELLO, this would be a total hold of $500 for the weekend. We were not offered an apology but attitude from the so called \"hospitality\" manager Tammy. I have not encountered such a poor excuse of a manager in recent memory. She was curt and extremely rude, interrupting my husband as he was trying to explain the issue. We were given a BS excuse as to why they charged us unnecessarily and \"accidentally\". It is my belief that they purposely charge customers for this \"membership\" hoping you will be too drunk or unaware to notice. At the end of the day it was a stupid $15 on a bill of over $250 for us, but it was about the principle and doing the right thing. Beware if you are going to look for extra charges to your bill!",

However upon booking a room at the MGM I learned that the property is technically not at the MGM it's behind the hotel off the strip. After getting there we had the worse service. Not only is this top golf considered a higher class the prices are reflected as well which you would think that since it wasn't that busy we would have great service.? Unfortunately that wasn't the case, none of our cards worked for some reason, we didn't get our upgraded clubs til an hour later so we were given  half hour of extra play however, towards the end as we were still golfing the server signed us out of our bay a half earlier so we never got the extra time. My worse experience ever at a top golf, not only is the location unfriendly but the prices are not worth it.  Needless to say I won't be coming back or bringing people whether friends or corporate company",

    "text": "I really want to write a 4-star review because this place was awesome, but we had a really strange experience that hindered our visit.  First off, the facility is beautiful, brand new and provides for a very unique activity in the heart of Vegas (wish we had one closer to home).  Pricey, but hey, what can you expect when in Vegas? We ordered a large sangria, and it was very tart (not in a good way) and very weak, but it did come in a cool little light up golf bag.   Now onto the, eh... strange part... I left my husband at the bay with the attendant to get the game set up while I went to the restroom.  I came back shortly thereafter to my husband, the attendant and a very strange waitress.  She babbled something to me, grabbed my husbands arm to show me some glitter on it and walked away...weird. It wasn't until we got settled that I asked my husband what that was all about.  He said that she seemed out of it (not making any assumptions, but possibly drunk?), had come to take our order, saw our shopping bag from Lush on the table, STUCK HER HAND IN OUR BAG, touched my bath bomb (which was covered in glitter), then proceeded to wipe it on my husbands arm.   I'm not a genius, but I think anyone with a brain would realize how grossly inappropriate this is, especially to reach into a customers shopping bag and grab what was in it!  Needless to say, it didn't sit well with me, unfortunate considering this happened on the first day of my birthday vacation.    Kicking myself for misplacing the receipt, which I saved on purpose to keep the waitresses name.",

On Tuesday night I went with my date to check it out and hit some balls...of which, my girl hasn't hit a ball in about 8yrs...making her rusty. So trying to help and give her some tips will cost you about $50, because apparently the meter is running.!. So I found this out when we finally got into a bay, and figured out how to even start with a basic \"target game\"(on Rookie Mode), we realized that our server took it upon herself to start the game for us 30mins prior...wtf.?.  Long story short, this place is ridiculously disappointing, a real tourists trap, and a scam.!.  What golfer would be happy or ok with hitting approximately 30 balls, being treated like we're bothering the servers, because they just want to turn as many tables as possible, and being forced to pay for another hour because it ran out as our apps came to our table...and in order to stay in the bay; \"You must be playing!,\" as you eat apparently.?.  Oh...and the kicker; for my girl and I, for two hrs, two apps, and five drinks, the bill came to $275.00.?.  Every golfer knows; for that price what you can do, where you can play, and what you can get, when it comes to golf.!?.  As a local & casino employee...I could never recommend this place, nor will I ever come back... If I was aloud to give it negative stars, it would be a -3... I feel disrespected, with a side of being kicked in the balls on the way out..",

    "text": "This place is a joke! So unprofessional and disrespectful!!! They profile ! I guess because I wore Jordan's and have braids I'm not worthy of great service.. smh sad. After TWO games of golf my friend and I sat at a table waiting to get service so we can order food. After 10 minutes of staff just walking by not acknowledging us AT ALL I got someone's attn. I asked the worker what time does the kitchen close he said 1:30 and it was 1am. I asked to put a order in to go and he told me one minute he'll send some one over. 15 minutes go by and NO ONE has stopped and said anything so once again I flag down another staff member asking her if I can place a to go order with her and she responds \"the kitchen is closed now\". Funny how it's closed at 1:15 and the other guy said 1:30. Which is it. So I asked to speak to a manager.. eventually he comes out, I believe his name was Nicolas or Andrew. Which ever claims to be an hospitality manager.. and this is where I felt very disrespected!! I tell him how we've waited and sat at the same table for over 30 minutes with NO service, was never acknowledged and all I want is to order food to go and it still hasn't happened. He tells me \"well yea the kitchen is closed now sooo \" looking at me like there's nothing he can do. So I ONCE again tell this man how WE HAVE BEEN WAITING and ASKED TWO different people at two separate times to order food and I KNOW THE kitchen wasn't closed when I sat down. He goes on and tells me \"well I'll see what I can do but you'll have to pay for your food first cause we wouldn't want any problems\". WHAT DOES THAT MEAN!!? Why would there be a problem!!? Are u judging I can't afford your prices? Are u assuming I will leave with out paying? What made u assume that ? PROFILING ! So to my better judgement I said no problem, paid for my food before getting it and sat and waited. I've told him specifically I want dipping sauces.. my food comes out in a box with no sauce, no napkins not even a bag to carry it in..just the to go box. So I'm walking towards the exit and I open the food to see if there's any sauce on the inside and of course it's not so I asked another worker I see at a computer can I please having dipping sauce.. he tells me the kitchen is closed, they can't make anything. CLEARLY NOT LISTENING cause blue cheese and ranch dipping sauce is not made to order. So once AGAIN I'm looking around like Am i in a twilight zone!! Meanwhile I see all the staff that I have spoke with talking through ear pieces, staff are looking at us saying things. No one is stupid, you know when you're being watched and talked about. Sad things is as I walk over to the bar to ask the bar tender and as I walk pass a group of staff I can LITERALLY hear them talking about what's happening with me and my food. That's unprofessional! So now everybody wants to be involved! I sat at the bar waiting for my sauce and Another female manager comes out with the \"let me play confused and talk soft like everything is fine \" . First thing out her mouth was \"I heard what happened\". I knew it was seriously time to go. Smh meanwhile I went home with soggy food, feelings disrespected ! A very uncomfortable feeling. It was my idea to come and golf because I've been before but maybe my prior experience was better because I was with a majority or Caucasians. You guys should be ashamed !! Close your doors if you're scared or feel a need to racial profile and treat others differently!! We're not going anywhere . Never did anyone ask are we ok or apologized for y'all lack or service! Just pure ignorance !! I'll never spend another dollar at this establishment !!",

While doing so, we gave the bay host the idea of transferring us to another bay since we did not have that much time due to another appointment right after that. So she did move us to the bay next to it. It went super well in the beginning but then half way playing it, the computer  crashed again when the bar host swiped her card. We decided to call our bay host again to see if they can fix it knowing we only had 20 minutes left before we had to leave. Long story short, the IT guy came again and tried to fix it but it took them almost another 15 minutes while we were just waiting in the heat doing nothing. The manager then came saying that they can extend the time but we said no cause we had to go. So they decided to comp us for the game which is fine. But i wish that i can get some sort of a voucher for the next game so that my family and I can experience the whole game again without any technical difficulties. A side note, we ended up not even receiving our players card. I believe the host forgot about it or something.",

Prices are a little high in my opinion, but they're selling the experience I guess, so as to be expected. Food is great! I've tried the pulled pork sliders here and they're really good!  However, they make you buy a membership before you can even play; it's only $5, but I feel like it's a little unnecessary. Can't I just pay the inflated price of $75/hour? Which brings us to the next chapter of the review. Prices: Levels 1 & 2 are priced identically while level 3 charges a little bit of a premium. Levels 1 and 2 charge anywhere from $30 - $60 an hour depending on the day of the week, and time of day. Level 3 charges anywhere from $45 - $90 an hour respectively.  That atmosphere tho ...",

I called and asked how the parking works, the agent that helped me said that we should park in the mgm grand since they are next door and they would validate parking or give game credits. Upon arriving at parking lot, we find out that it wasn't very close to the location and then we show up and it looks like there is a parking lot attached to top golf, I went in and asked if they could validate parking and the front desk was very rude asking me who told us that. I told them that I had called and I wasn't sure the agents name and maybe the name is Isaac, they told me that they were going to take care of this. Some guy named Isaac shows up at our bay and confronts me saying that he heard someone said that I said he told me to park at mgm and they validate ( now this wasn't isaacs fault it was the front desk) but I told Isaac that his voice didn't match who I spoke to and I was sorry that they had him come up to talk to us. First off I work in hospitality and this is not how you treat guests. They did nothing to resolve the isssue of telling me to park at mgm when they have their own lot, it seems like this place is telling people to park there so they can increase revenue for the hotel that they are affiliated with. I've never been so disappointed with an entertainment place. We also had to wait 15 minutes for our bay, we had reservations and were there early. Then our server tried telling us that we only had 5 minutes left, we the had to tell her that we didn't start on time, which she should have known as she was there when it happened   Only go here if you feel like wasting money and trying to show off, or if you like getting treated like a stray animal",

The main level walk in (second floor) they have two HUGE wide screens big open atrium area with different seating from lounge seats, bar tables with bar stools, and some face the widesreen or bar tables see people hitting balls. They even have tiny sports book that can play bets on football. I came here with cousins from Portland, OR watch some Thursday Night Football. They even have props bets like Super Bowl that bet who scores the first touchdown, etc... FYI my cousins been to the Topgolf in Portland, OR obviously size no way can compete with this location but even they were blown away by the size. They have bar area on every level. The top floor or fourth floor it more of a True ultra lounge feels with live Dj playing music. Between the fourth and third floor even have swimming pool. The music playing am sure from the Dj but current music and stuff get all party mood or club mood. Crazy. It takes golfing range to another level.   The golfing part not much of golfer. I meet my cousins for the food but also just check it out. My cousins been to the location in Portland and wanted too see the mother load or battleship of Topgolf. They were not disappointed. They gave me the lowdown on way the golf part works. They take no reservations. It depends on the day of the week and time the wait. Like anything on the strip nothing cheap about Topgolf from food, golf, or drinks. It goes by groups so it actually not that bad when spilt it up with six others. The thing makes it current with high tech experience. All the golf balls has trackers so can literally follow your ball and keep tracks of point if you land it in certain spots. Or hell just enjoy the backdrop of the strip or the massive wide screens that have some sports on. No need brings clubs they provide them. Each driving range spot have nice lounge chairs kick back and server come by if wants drinks or food.   The food. Honest I had no expectations cause thinking growing up few times went driving range nothing good or memorable about driving range food. Topgolf the food is pretty awesome. We ordered three appetizers to share between three of us. We got the kalbi short rib tacos, Greek Chicken Skewers, and Topgolf Wings (mango habanero). They were all amazing!! I would recommend all of them. The Skewers not only was the chicken cooked perfect but the tzatzaki sauce that was the key. It brought the whole dish together, The kalbi short rib tacos was my favorite of the three. Not only was the kalbi the da bomb. I could just have whole plater of kalbi. Instead of taco shell use steam bun. So more cross from peking duck with steam bum. It was so good. The Topgolf wings they have few different sauces choose from. Mango Habanero it has nice late kick. Be warned! The carrot and celery stick or not stick but peelings. Weird. I would have preferred regular traditional carrot and celery sticks. The wings were solid. The menu not that big or crazy. I like that fact. It simple food some of it take another level.   No doubt if looking for something different to do and with group or small one. Topgolf is great spot. It comes to parking I parked at the MGM parking lot and walking  down the street. The parking lot or valet for Topgolf not that big. If the lot full pretty much nightmare/",

    "text": "I've been here a couple times and it's definitely a fun place to go when visitors are in town. I don't know what my motivation would be as a local on a regular basis, but our out-of-town visitors had a great time, whether they were avid golfers or not.  The wait has never been too terrible for us and in one case, they called us earlier than the 30 minutes they said they would be. Still, I wouldn't suggest going here without a reservation if you are trying to \"squeeze\" it into a busy scheduled day.   It's Topgolf, so most everything is impressive, and even the flatbreads and drinks are yummy. One thing that is a little annoying to me is that they tout locals prices, but they never ask you when they bring your bill out (when it matters) for your ID. So, if you're a local or with a local, make sure to pay attention to the bill. It's not a huge discount but that's not the point!  Also, of course the higher the floor the more VIP/more money, but the main floor is the only place I've been and it's been a great time. Our hitting bays have been on the side and right smack dab in the middle and you can still hit the ball from anywhere. Also, IT'S OK IF YOU STINK at golf, no one judges! :)",

However, just about the entire place was blocked off for private events including the brunch area (therefore no brunch and no specials) and the pool. If you're there to watch a game it's really not worth it. The TV area is cool but the food and drinks are way too expensive, not to mention their beer selection is very limited. Go here if you're actually going to golf or are lucky enough to be invited to a private event (which likely happen a lot).",

We were there for 45 minutes, and we were moved from our section three different times, still... with no service. An hour that should have been spent golfing, turned into an hour of us sitting on our asses. Clearly, management has some work to do. A \"job\", is what most employees should have been there for, but it looked like they were all there to hang out and collect a paycheck.

Upon indulging in the buffalo wings that \"appeared\" to be delicious and exquisitely UnMatched, I noticed a piece of pink chewing gum on my plate (I have attached a picture for reference). Now, bubble gum isn't my forte ESPECIALLY when it's on my plate for my BUFFALO WINGS. If you take a moment to look at the picture, the gum was in the shape of 2 balls and there was a perfectly placed blonde hair right between the gum balls. Use your imagination. Now, as funny as this is...I'm laughing because you CANNOT make this up at this point. I bring the perfectly crafted male appendage sculpture to the attention of one of the waitresses (not the one that was waiting on my Bay) which is more than happy to take it away. When I tried to take a picture of it for proof, she said, \"I don't feel comfortable with you doing that!\" And then proceeded to try to snatch the plate out of my hand. I had to stiff arm her to get her away from me in order to take the picture. My feeling is that she was trying to cover it up which isn't going to fly with ya boy! So...needless to say, I got my picture and I also requested to speak with the manager. Upon having a detailed conversation with him about the male appendage that resided on my dinner plate, he comped an hour of play. All in all, if you like already chewed gum as part of your golfing experience, I recommend this place 100% You just may have to pay a little extra for the chewed gum experience.",

They said they under quoted times and wouldn't have anything ready anytime soon, or we could choose a lower level after another hour. Had dinner plans so we didn't get to play. Pretty bummed about that and that we wasted a couple hours and had to check in ourselves.  UPDATE: Brittany has reached out to me and listened to my complaints and is looking to make it right. She has been quick to respond and very helpful. I really appreciate that and will update this review when I get to go again.",

    "text": "I wanted to like this place so much.  The Good: it's a really great view of the strip and the driving range is unique.... for Vegas. They have a lot of TV's. These types of ranges are not a new concept and the hype isn't real. Wow, I can't even be nice when describing the good about it.   The Bad: only 6 people can be listed as players- otherwise you have to double up. The parking sucks. It's a super small lot, with an overflow in MGM. Womp womp. The prices are pretty high- which I get, but it's definitely not something I'd be willing to shell out on the reg. We weren't even a big group, a party of 9, and the space they gave us was small. Not everyone was able to sit down. Most of us had to stand outside of the space, behind the couches.   The Long Winded Version:   Upon arriving, we were trying to figure out where our group was. After walking around a bit, I asked the women at the private events if there were any reservations for 8 PM for a birthday party. The woman assisting us was less than pleasant. She was actually pretty freaking rude. She was really no help at all, dismissing us for every single party that had checked in for 8/8:15. Sorry lady- I've never been to TopGolf before. Next time, I will walk around 3 giant floors to figure out what's going on instead of seeking any kind of help from an employee.   When we got our stall on the driving range, I ordered a Bullitt Old Fashioned off of their signature drink menu and just asked for a little ice. I got a glass with alcohol and no garnishes. I had to send it back twice- the first time he brought it back without an orange or cherry. The second time with an orange and no cherry. The third time, he managed to come back with both. How do you not know how to make a drink on your suggested list of mixed drinks? It's not like it was anything extravagant or out of the ordinary... So wtf?  They have a decent selection of clubs. It's cool because there are multiple floors. There are a lot of bars and the waiters come to your table while you golf. Exiting the designated Top Golf parking lot sucks on a Friday night.   I've seen the Vegas local foodie IG's posts about this place and it seemed awesome, but unfortunately, we didn't get that. I'm much more content going to a $10/100 ball driving range with a 6 pack and receiving basic, well executed customer service vs a fancy place where they can't get their ish together.",

We did have to wait a bit til our stall was ready but its nice that they have couches and some games to play while you wait. We went in early march and it was still a bit chilly at night, it was great that they have heaters on in our stall so we weren't freezing. One thing i liked was that they provide you with golf clubs and its more like a game. They tell you to try to hit towards a certain goal like the yellow flag. My bf, his friend and his friends son thoroughly enjoyed their time and had so much fun hitting balls. We didn't order any food or drinks but I'm sure next time we come back here, we might get some drinks. This place is a bit pricy but its not a bad place if you want to just hang out with friends, eat, drink and golf. a good but different experience from clubbing/partying!  total for 1 hr: $70",

Last night my family and I came here and the parking lot was almost empty, slow night I guess. We where greeted by the front desk staff, as they like to call each other associates. Very friendly and energetic as well. As we all sat down and played, then we ordered food that they bring to your table. Prices were a little high but nothing to outrageous, they have 4 levels and other games to play there as well. Food was great and so was the ambience, to my surprise there are two types of pools one on they 3rd level and a smaller one on the 4th. My guess more private for celebrities and guest they come to town. The view is jaw-dropping as it over looks the side of the strip from a different view I'm usually not familiar with. All in all, I would be coming back more often. I love it here.",

It was more like a 5 minute wait.  We sat at the bar for a little bit and the bartenders were attentive and fun to talk to.    We were booth 205 and played a basic game.  Its basically darts but playing golf.  Each of the targets (holes) have different point values and you usually swing 5 times then the other player goes.  It does get expensive here so happy hour is probably the best time to go.  We were at $75 an hour when we went and it can get even more expensive.  Our waitress brought my friend these cake balls that you shoot frosting in and holy shit they were amazing.  The drinks were strong and the gold was fun.  There is shuffle board, and corn hole as well.  I heard there is a pool on the 3rd floor and there are huge TVs around the area.   I'd recommend going here with at least a group of 4 to offset the cost a bit especially if its not durning happy hour.  Be careful of drunk people with golf clubs, and don't fall into the net... :)",

The games are super fun and the food is shockingly good especially the sushi and the shrimp appetizer.  Drinks were pricey but good.    I definitely recommend reserving in advance if you have a group though they will charge a special service fee.  Also, it was a bit weird at the end when they recommended we separately tip the other staff e.g. bussers -- would prefer it all be included in the service charge/gratuity.  Also, they have a pool you can hang out in while waiting for your bay to be available!",

    "text": "Top golf is always a fun, laid back option for entertainment with friends or family. Top Golf is just a big range and you take turns hitting golf balls in the attempt to get your ball into large holes. Hitting the golf balls into farther holes gets you more points. You get a lane kind of like bowling and you get charged by the hour for the use of the lane and individual membership cards (which are a one-time $5 charge and can be used at any Top Golf). It was quite chilly in Vegas and my group was placed in the last lane. The last lane only had one overhead heater while the other lanes had 2 heaters to keep warm. So we were cold and uncomfortable in our lane. My friends and I ordered food and just relaxed and played our round. I ordered the pulled pork sliders which came with tater tots. I wasn't impressed by the food. I ate the tater tots and didn't really enjoy the pulled pork sliders. The bbq sauce used for the sliders was too sweet.",

    "text": "Came here last Saturday with a group of 8 people. Always wanted to come here since it opened and finally got to check it out with my girlfriend and her cousins that were visiting for the weekend.   I knew it was a nice place but it was more than I expected. I wouldn't say that it's just a fancy driving range. But it's more of a all out entertainment center. With bars, tvs, and even a pool inside.   We arrived around 10 PM on Saturday night, there was plenty of parking, we were headed up the stairs to the entrance and a guy told us it was a 2 almost 3 hour wait. We were a little shocked at first, it was a Saturday night and we expected it to be busy but not that busy. We decided to stay and wait anyways.   While we were waiting we hung out and played some corn ball and had some drinks. My sister in law had some wings and fries which looked good. They have a full food menu and from the looks of it, it looks good although I didn't order anything. The drinks were good and about your average price for a drink in Vegas. Aka expensive and not strong enough. We only ended up waiting for about 40 minutes before they texted us that our bay was ready. Not a long wait at all and we were already enjoying ourselves so that's a plus.   Now the real part of the review, the golfing experience. It was everyone's first time here so the manager or the supervisor or who ever he was talked to us about how to play and work the score monitor and what not. I'm a lefty so they had to bring out my own set of left handed clubs. The orthodox clubs are already placed there in the bay.  Everyone took turns swinging and had a good time. I've played at driving ranges before and I like how at this range it's very easy to see the flight of your ball. The real only con I have is the technical problems. At least 3 or 4 times our screen/scoreboard froze or glitched out. And we had to call someone to come over to reset it. They ended up giving us a extra 20 minutes for the technical difficulties.   The total was a little over 200. Split 8 ways. It's decently priced for the experience and will be looking forward to our next night out here.",

We played in the first floor Becuase it was only a 10 minute wait. While the rest of the levels was a long wait, or costed about $15 more for 3rd and 4th level.   Didn't get to try their menu at this time maybe next time when I come back I will. Would definetly bring a group of friends and stay longer than one hour.

Chicken wings come glazed in your choice of mango habanero, Asian sesame, buffalo, or BBQ sauce. Rock shrimp was a touch sweet, but meaty with a crispy exterior. The roasted garlic flatbread had some good flavors with the combo of spinach,garlic, and ricotta all on a thin, crispy crust. The tuna tartare was good, too, but those accompanying chips were spicy.

Didn't matter if you knew how to golf, it was set up like a driving range with patio to eat/drink and watch sports. You have to reserve ahead of time. It does get packed (2 Hour wait). FYI: lower levels 1-2 are cheaper before 5pm. Price goes up after 5pm and 3rd level areas are more expensive. Have fun.",

We came on a Wednesday afternoon in July, the super friendly hostesses welcomed us and we had a 20min wait for second level. We ordered drinks and that's the reason for 1 star  less: drinks are a rip off!!   We explored the place and it's just a waw! The activities like bag throwing, ping pong and the 2 awesome pools from which you can watch the big screen next to it. Impressive.  We got a golf boot center. The hostess was very nice, young but just great at her job there. She explained the computer and set us up.  But we had to wait on a waitress to appear. Her service was terrible. Another star off . It was hot out and to get a drink at our boot was a mission.  The game was so much fun but we left after an hour with a receipt of $47 for the game and about the same for few drinks and a fancy water. I would totally go back but bring a bag with waters before I get dehydrated there. Overall great experience!",

The food was great, especially the carne asada nachos! Also tried the sea bass sliders which were pretty good, the chips were a little burnt though.   I have never golfed this way -- and i loved it! Super technical with the golf balls being chipped and being able to keep score if you were to get the ball in to any of the various holes.   The staff was very helpful and accommodating. The only thing was our server kept forgetting / mistaking our orders. She did comp the sliders that took an hour to come out though, which was nice.   It was definitely a fun, social experience and I would for sure do this again.",

The golfing is the main event though to be sure. Best to come at night as the field is lit and the targets glow in different colors. There are various games you can program into you own screen.   For those who don't know your golf balls have some magical GPS chip or something and log where they land so there's no confusion as to who scored what. Really cool. The games are a blast and this is a fun place to come with friends.",

    "text": "As a local, I've visited Topgolf a couple of times since it's opening here in Las Vegas, and it's a lot of fun!   Topgolf is a multi-level driving range that offers bay rentals by the hour. The cheapest is $30/hr on the first level, and the price increases the higher you want to be situated. While the top floor obviously offers the best views, Topgolf was designed so that every level offers wonderful views of Las Vegas.   If you've never visited Topgolf before, it's very beginner friendly; imagine a driving range with dart boards scattered everywhere, and the object of most of the games is to hit the ball into these \"dart boards\" or \"holes,\" each assigned with different point values. Each bay can comfortably seat 4-5 people, the seating arrangement containing an L shaped couch as well as a table.   The best way to do Topgolf is with friends; you can get 4-5 friends and easily split the cost of renting a bay for a few hours of fun. I'd also recommend going at night. While Topgolf faces north, away from the sun, it's still extremely hot during the summer, and the temperature is just perfect in the later hours of the day. My final recommendation is to go during off-peak days to avoid massive crowds (Tuesday, Wednesday).  Chow down on the food if you'd like, but since you're right behind The Strip, you're going to be paying tourist trap prices. The attendants also can be a bit aggressive in wanting your party to purchase food or drinks, so be mindful.   Overall, Topgolf is an awesome place to spend some quality time with friends, or to bring someone on a date!",

But one swing and I was hooked, and my competitive side really did come out. There are different types of colored holes (large ones) on the floor and they light up. Each hole gets you certain points. The lady who helped us explained that there were different games you can play, but we chose the simple one. It's a great place for the family or a night out with friends. Definitely, a place to try out whenever you're in Vegas. Service could have been better, but I get that they're busy.   Oh and they have games and a great lounge area to hang out in while you wait for your spot to open. It gets really busy so make that reservation!!",

    "text": "A friend and I were really excited to try out topgolf brunch. We had it planned a few weeks ago. When we got to the second floor, we asked a waitress where the brunch area was. She directed us to the four tables, the bar and pool area right in front of her station. We sat down at a table and waited. Ten minutes passed by and no one had greeted us. I went to the bar area to grab a brunch menu. A waitress finally came over and asked us what we wanted to eat right after I had grabbed a menu. We told her we needed a few minutes. We ordered mimosas from a different waitress that came by a few minutes later. I had two free mimosa coupons when topgolf was promoting it through Rock and roll wine club. I showed the waitress my coupons and she placed our drink orders. She saw the coupons but did not take them with her.   We ordered food and my friend really enjoyed her breakfast burrito. My pork belly \"nachos\" were not good. The pork belly was dry and I left over half of my food untouched.   We asked for our check and it was bought over by a different waitress who charged us for the mimosas. I showed her the coupons I had showed a different waitress and she said we were not sitting in the proper area to use the coupon. We told her that a waitress told us where the brunch area was. The waitress spoke with a manager and eventually got the mimosas taken off but not without telling us that we \"were told the wrong thing and definitely not sitting in the right area.\" Essentially telling us we were in the wrong.   Overall, not pleased with the food but the lack in service is what really killed the experience for me. How dare you blame the customers for not sitting in the proper area when we were directed by a waitress/one of your staff members? And the nerve to actually tell us to our face? As a local, I will not be recommending this place to any of my friends.",

    "text": "Definitely a must go attraction if you're visiting Vegas! This place gets packed quickly during the weekends and nights so plan accordingly.  Parking is such a hassle. Since they don't have a garage they do offer valet for $5 but their valet is extremely small. Since it was full we parked at the MGM garage. I believe the first hour is free anything over 1-4 hours it will be $7. They don't offer free parking to locals anymore. I went with my boyfriend and friend during March Madness on a weekend. We got super lucky since we arrived around 12pm and our wait time was only half a hour! You can't call to reserve unless you buy a VIP table. Since my group wasn't 21+ we were only allowed on the first floor to golf. While waiting we decided to grab food. I ordered their tacos and side of tater tots. My bf and friend ordered burgers. The food was delicious and the presentation was perfect.  Since there were only three of us we decided to rent for 1 hour. If you're new to top golf they will require you to join their membership. You can either get a daily membership or lifetime. I recommend getting the lifetime since it is the same price as the daily membership.  We ended playing three full games during the one hour. I recommend having each play go five times before switching.  Overall we had a lot of fun and we can't wait to come back here again at night!",

    "text": "A word of advice. If you are going to put old bald headed men in a golf cart to threaten people like the idiot Joel, then you all should probably make sure they know the law. My husband and I came for an event and parking was packed. We pulled up along the west wall (don't be upset that we thought outside the box) that had no signs stating no parking, no painted no parking zones labeled, or red lines. Joel pulled up and told us we could not park there. My husband stated there were no notices advising that it was a no parking zone (again businesses that know how to do business have this). Joel then proceeds to say he didn't need to have signs and there are parking spots with lines and he would have us towed with one quick phone call.   First off you can't tow a vehicle that is not in a red zone and if you have no notices saying it is a no park zone. Even with notices vehicles have 24 hours to move (this is the warning stuck to the vehicle by the business or third party towing company). So while Joel thought he was threatening us all he did was make himself look stupid. Tell him to read LVMC 11.24.010 through 030  If Top Golf doesn't want vehicles to park in certain areas then it would be smart to post notices and not have old bald men riding around attempting to threaten people. I know Top Golf will probably not care about how we were treated by Joel. After all we were just one of the many people that were there right? Our money and our patronage doesn't matter right? I will never refer Top Golf to people I know or my hotel guest that ask me where to go. Get your ducks in a row first before sending out \"security\" to speak on things they don't know. Take some time to train your team especially Joel.",

All other areas including the bar were roped off for \"private events.\" We out our group on the waitlist to play golf, found some seating to share with another group. We waited about 30 minutes for a waitress to even acknowledge us. (Normally we would have just gone to the bar but it was blocked for the private party). When our waitress Dana finally acknowledged us, she was rude, unfriendly, didn't seem like she had an interest in taking our drink order and dinner order. Our food arrived which was good, but we had to eat sitting on couches and no one bothered to bring us silverware or napkins until we flagged someone down to ask for them. Our waitress Dana didn't acknowledge us for the rest of our night (9pm when we closed out and went to our golf area). A group of middle aged men joined the party sitting next to us. It was very hard not to notice how attentive and friendly she was with them. When one of our group members asked her for another drink as she was walking away from getting orders from the middle aged men sitting next to us, she was rude, rolled her eyes and looked annoyed that we wanted more drinks. We had several other nice waiters stop by and get drink orders and bring us more cocktails and clear our dinner plates but never once did Dana check on us. As a former waitress/bartender this was hard not to notice how awful her service was. We are a group of travel nurses from California, Arizona, and myself a current local here in Las Vegas. We wanted to have drinks and spend money here. Dana left an awful impression on all of us! We did get to our golf area and our waitress there was very attentive and friendly! Besides this review I will be seeking to speak to someone else at this business. I have never been treated so poorly by a waitress. It was almost embarrassing for our group how she acted to us. Never mind the fact we couldn't even get our own drinks at the bar and we sat and ate dinner on couches with no silverware/napkins for the first part of our meal.",

They have music, live entertainment, two pools, drinks, food, golfing, areas for lounging, and games like shuffle board. The atmosphere is fun, lively, and upscale. It has a beautiful view at night.  I do not know how to golf so my experience was hysterical trying to learn. The pricing is quite high per hour, however you may have 6 people golfing at a time so if you split the price it's pretty reasonable. Your bay host will register each player and teach you how to play different games offered on their system. You get points for making your ball in certain holes so it can get competitive if your group is decent at golfing.   I think it's a great alternative to a nightclub. It has the atmosphere on the 3rd floor where it's 21 and up, but it isn't as loud and pricey as a nightclub. You can still order bottle service there in the bays.   The only two cons about top golf would be that the wait can be very long when they are busy and the check in area is a bit disorganized getting parties to the correct bays.  Overall, a very fun and unique experience outside the typical Las Vegas strip activities.",

    "text": "Yep, so we've been at Topgolf for about 30 minutes now and have already experienced the worst in customer service from the bartenders. No surprise, I suppose, after the reviews we've read about this place. It seems pretty hit or miss depending on the day, time, or initiative of the staff. The dude that appeared to be at our end of the bar decided for some reason that he would rather talk with a couple of other dudes than attend to anyone else that clearly needed service.   I can say, however, that the two different young women we spoke to at the reservation counter were friendly and helpful.   Alas, we haven't even golfed yet. Hopefully, things will turn around and I'll be able to update my review with a fun and satisfying experience.  So, I'm adding a star and was tempted to add another. Super fun, and our waitress at our golf bay was great. Very friendly and accommodating. Definitely check this place if you have the time and are looking for something different!  We ended up only having to wait 45 minutes for our 3rd level bay  ($60/hr) and folded for an hour which was plenty for two of us. We only got a flatbread to eat, but it was delicious.   Check out TopGolf Vegas, you won't be disappointed!",

There was a much longer wait for the top two so we went for the level 1. It's a little cheaper, but I would definitely want to do an upper level next time. Upper levels give you a better view, and if you're not as good of a golfer, you ball is at a better angle and goes further. . We were quoted 45 min but only waited 20. They have lots of games you can try. Food and drink menu is decent. We went in February and the heaters make it feel like you're not even outside. We were comfortable in our t shirts. We will be back!",

Pros: Local discount, beautiful view, awesome food(reasonable price).  Cons: Loooong wait time(2-3 hours unless you reserve a pay with a minimum food and beverage tab) \"Server\" was really rude. I was a server for 4 years and she definitely needs to learn a thing or two about customer service.   Overall I definitely want to come back but will request a different server if she is assigned to that bay.",

We waited for an hour for a Bay on the 2nd level and we're joined by our friends who live in Vegas but had not been to TopGolf before.  Brock took great care of us, explaining everything we needed to know to play.  We played two games of TopGolf before the heat got to us, but it's Vegas in June  -- what could we expect??  The food was brought quickly and our drinks were refilled on request.  Looks like my friends are hooked.  We had a great time.  Even if my game is totally inconsistent, we always enjoy our visits to TopGolf.  Although it was hotter than Hades, we swing with the best of 'em!  Thanks!!",

The concept and setup are friendly to everyone- from the dude in the next bay who took it way too seriously and brought his own clubs to a couple of people in our group who'd never swung a club, everyone had a good time. As mentioned in a few other reviews, the food isn't that great (3stars tops on it's own) but the facility, staff and ambience is nothing but good times!

Was perfect for me as I flew in Friday night and wanted to have some fun but not blow all my energy on night 1.  Topgolf is a driving range with circles/goals at several points on the course. You can play and try to get your ball into the actual goals to accumulate points or simply hit balls for fun. We got bottle service which was just like at a club..the waiters came out with signs and drinks! There's also all sorts of mostly bar food available. During warmer months, there's a nice mini-pool and lounge. Highly recommend especially for golf lovers!",

Theres a long wait time to golf, but if you really don't care about what level your on, go with level 1, the more popular bay's is 2 -4. The bay's are timed so plan to wait about 2hrs, on a weekend. We had dinner and drinks while we waited, so it worked out perfect. We were able to play with four people in an hour, and that was more than enough time Food was good and drinks were good not over priced at all. I definitely will return next time in Vegas.",

The pricing is setup per hour, per bay (picture a bowling alley with nice seating).  Depending on what level you choose, and what day of the week, pricing varies.  Each bay can fit up to 6 people.  Since we came in the morning, we had brunch here as well.  Let me tell you, the food here is unbelievable, so good.   We ordered the following: 7 Layer Dip Kalbi Short Rib Tacos - comes with 3 Tater Tots Breakfast Sandwiches Margherita Pizza  Out of all of them, I would say the tacos and the sandwich were the best choices.  I've heard their dinner menu is just as good too.   The clubs here are provided, both Men's and Women's.  If you are super competitive, you may also BYOC (bring your own clubs).",

The Vegas location is brand new and all automatic. They have air conditioned playing \"bays\" like a bowling lane with different games. You use a golf club (they're provided) to swing in front of a button and viola! A ball appears. The games are all different, however the premise is, you want to hit the ball far or into one of the circular sensors. Whoever has the most points wins! You also have a waiter or waitress who can bring you drinks or food. You rent the bay by the hour, so the more people, the cheaper. The lower decks are cheaper and it's cheaper to go in the AM verses the PM. As well as being cheaper during the week compared to the weekend.  Some locations offer kid camps, lessons, etc.  The Vegas location has an awesome lounge/bar area with a huge TV screen for watching games. The food was also surprisingly good. Although pricey when all is said and done, it's a very good time.   I would not hesitate to play there anytime I had a chance. Don't let being an inexperienced golfer turn you away, most people I witnessed playing were just as bad as me :)",

I can hit them, and always very well.  Did you see what I did there?  Combining the two...my mind was blown.  We went on Sunday 11/13/16 with my mom and her boyfriend, who are scratch golfers (retired people always run the course, ugh) and then me, my BF and his daughter and her BF (both 19 years old).  So there were experts, intermediates, and beginners.    ALL of us had an excellent time!  It was so much more fun than I expected.  The experience is worth having.  Even if you suck at golf, it will be fun.  You rent a bay, get your table and server and they take care of getting you cocktails and food, and you just...golf.  We aimed for the targets, some of us hit them, some of us hit the side nets, it didn't matter.  It's a great atmosphere to bring people together.  My boss and the rest of the district managers for my company did this in Houston, it's a great team-building venue.  Which can help certain families as well LOL  Drinks were good, I was enjoying Moscow Mules, but everyone was getting freebie Michelob Ultra's (not the 19 year olds, they were our DD's) and we all loved the food...had the edamame, the crispy rock shrimp and the wings...kids got two sunset burgers which looked delish.  We will MOST DEFINITELY be back.  I hear that they are opening a SD location sometime not too far away...I can't wait.  It was seriously so much fun for everyone of all ages, I'd say 18 year olds to 80 year olds would have fun. We  spanned 19 to 67 and a good time was had by all.   And, my golf game may have improved...maybe.  Can't wait to go again!",

    "text": "I would have rated them much higher but thought some of their practices weren't cool and kind of put a damper on the experience. First, it's a cool concept and we had fun.  Had two children that had never golfed before and two adults.  There were no children's clubs available so we sat and waited, they said they'd bring them to us as soon as they were available....but we were paying by the hour (whoops forgot that) and after waiting quite awhile just had them play with adult clubs.  Kid clubs never came. Didn't like the time spent having them input everyone's personal information, phone number email addresses and birthdays for even the kids.  I wasn't willing to give my kids emails and the attendant seems to push for it again and gave up.  You have to pay $5 for each person for a membership even for children...thought that was kind of a money grab.  Gamification of a driving range makes for a fun activity so I really enjoyed that and the ambiance was hip.   Portion sizes on their snack food was less than desirable, $6 fries in a tiny silver sleeve can hardly be called snackable food.  Homemade chips were small portioned as well.   Biggest compliant I had was that we checked in around 11:15 am and there was a 45 minute wait which was fine because we didn't have reservations...I get that.  BUT we didn't start golfing until after noon and after noon they change the pricing tier up by $15.  I didn't think it was fair to do that based on when \"they\" could get to us...it should be based on when you arrive...like bars do at happy hour.  Especially when you are increasing a fairly decent percentage.   Additionally it should just let you play and bill you based on how much time you are playing or pay for a certain amount of \"games\" like bowling...really sucked to be playing only our second game and it shut off before the last child could shoot her last few balls.  Maybe a meter or a warning or something...instead we'd all been having a good time but left with a crying child.  Just felt unfinished, unresolved, to not get to tally up scores and allow everyone to play to completion especially after waiting so long for kids clubs.  Could you imagine going bowling and playing 8 frames and it just shuts off?  You'd feel cheated, like \"we'll shoot maybe I could still have won\" Eh...there are a lot of options in Vegas probably won't go back",

The computer kept freezing so they gave us 30min of free game. We ordered some beer and food. The waitress came back with a $380 tab..it was wrong so it was changed to $330 because of their mistake. Then they charged is $550. Oh wait their bad again. So they went ahead and charged us $75 less. We went back to get our car out of valet. Well because top golf kept us at least an hr longer than needed the valet was shut down and we had to walk to the main MGM valet which is not close at all. The management was less than helpful and the experience was awful. We talked to employees that work their and a majority of them said they were putting in their 2 weeks because of how poorly it is ran. Will not go back.",

We tried ordering drinks before our station was ready but they don't acknowledge you until you as the customer have to get their attention and wave them down.  Besides the whole bar incident, everything else was a pleasant experience.  Our party of 6 got our range station and the waitress and host were amazing.  Very attentive and answered any questions we had.  expect to stay at least a hour and half to 2 hours depending on how fast your group hits/plays.  Drink/food prices are decent.  They let you use Callaway clubs which were in excellent condition.  I recommend you bring or buy a golf glove cause the grips get slippery.  not sure if we'd come back though, rather spend the money on a course.",

Of course once we closed out check she pretty much kicked us out.",

    "text": "I've been wanting to come here but wanted to wait a little so it could not me such a madhouse since it just opened. It's crazy big. 1st and 2nd floor is for families and kids with a big area to watch sports and sit down in the middle. I saw a sportsbook but was closed. It be pretty cool to make a sports bet and just sit in the middle area with the big tvs and watch the games. More to do than a sportsbook in a casino. Everyone there was real nice and the drinks weren't too pricy. The 3rd and 4th floor is for 21 and up and the music is louder and also has a pool, pool bar, and cabanas. I'm not even sure if the casino pools have a pool bar from the ones I've been to. We played for almost 2 hours and time does fly when your having fun. We ordered some bass sliders with tots and they were real good. Games are easy to figure out. Only reason I did NOT give 5 stars is their valet area. They really need to figure all that out. I waited about 15 min for my car and people trying to get in were causing traffic on koval since it was backed up. They need the actual thru lane to be a thru lane if people need to get dropped off. Saw a few accidents almost happen. Wouldn't be good. Inside top golf though... It's awesome. I'll be there again next week! Might park at the Mgm though.",

    "text": "First time ever to Topgolf, heard so much about it, I actually live next door to it and watch the construction for over 6 months. I brought my staff  group of 16 people last night..  A few days prior I was on the phone to a lady that said we couldn't book ahead unless we were willing to pay $1000+ for a booth. Kinda just want to play some golf not spend $1000 dollars.. Anyways so I rocked up early to book our locations we were on a waiting list for about an hour an half for 2 booth side by side. No worries we chilled at the top floor had drinks etc quite nice but really just waiting till our bays were ready. Finally get a text message and we got two bays but they were away from eachother (which sucked) it was another 1-2 hours wait to get side by side. No dramas we just made do with what we had. What really annoyed me and reason for my low rating. We just waited 90 min was told only 20-40 min and really wanted booths side by side. We were put way apart and the guy didn't tell us about an additional $5 each person needs to pay, nor did he say having 16 people, you would need 3 booths not 2, I think the staff just assume you know the rules and how it's all done. Anyways, one of the bay's worked, the other bay the computer was stuffed for another half an hour, by then we were just completely over it and got drunk spent over a grand on alcohol and food anyways. Makes me wonder we prob should have did the 1st option. The service was incredible awesome but the Top Golfing experience was really average.",

    "text": "I want to first off saying that I love top golf as a company, but not a fan of it in vegas. we went on a Monday night at around 10pm so we expected a small wait since it was the week after it opened. so we waited about 30min for a station, which wasn't too bad. I received a text saying our station was ready, they told me what station to go to and that an attendant was going to meet us there in a couple of minutes since they were so <a href=\"/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2Fbusy.so&s=66fef41cd0ab2b6a21ef7a5f672c7e7fdbad931bd47d68a0ebbd939b9940d5e0\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">busy.so</a> we went and waited and waited I waited for about 20 min and got up asked for help and they said theyd be right there and yet no one still showed up. now luckily ive been to topgolf in Austin twice so I figured how difficult could it be to set it up myself. 5min later we were playing golf. we got 45 min in and were done. still no one ever showed up, not even a waitress to take a drink order. ended up walking up to a random waitress to cash us out. so yea, I love  top golf on the grounds of I enjoy driving ranges but Im totally disappointed in the service that I received. would have thought that since I was in vegas wed be getting exception service hell any service.",

    "text": "Overall we really enjoyed ourselves.  Both of our kids golf, and they thought it was great fun. Just a couple of complaints.  It was super hot here. Although there is air-conditioning in the bar, the hitting bay's are not air-conditioned.  Definitely consider waiting until the heat wave passes. Also there isn't any description of the different games you can play except on the computer.  We wasted some of our time reading them, and at up to $90/hour, time is money people! It would be nice if they had a printed card or brochure to look at while the other golfers are hitting.  We played their top golf signature game and the chipping game. The second one focuses on just the closest targets so it eliminates the advantage a long hitter has. Finally, it turns out I'm afraid of golfing from heights. My balance was really off since I kept leaning away from the edge. I'd take a first floor bay next time!  I'm sure we'll be back. My daughter wants to make it a regular stop for our family Vegas visits.",

We were over charged in our group for two drinks but we didn't bring it up. The server/cocktail staff were walking around with dead faces like zombies but I don't blame them for working long hours in the summer heat. Last but not least I walked to the bar on the lower floor asked for a beer on tap by name and even pointed at it, the bartender (female) repeated my beer order to me and still poured the wrong beer lmao.. How do you do this.... It was too awesome, her response to me was oops I think I poured the wrong one and quickly put the glass in the lower cooler. I will defiantly be back.

The prices are a little expensive when it is just two people but if you split the cost between a group of friends, it is pretty reasonable. On top of the price per hour, each person playing needs to be a \"member\" so that is an additional $5. For 1 hour of golfing between my husband and myself, it cost us a little over $60 at around 11am on a weekday.  I recommend if you are a golf fan!",

    "text": "From the drive in to the drive out, I had a pleasant and enjoyable time. Finding this location which is on Koval and Harmon was easy and just so you know, you enter on Koval side. There was more than enough parking when the three of us went to experience the new place in town. There are three levels of enjoyment all with their own bar on it (happy dance). The second level actually has big, i mean gigantic screen tvs and games to keep you busy while you wait for your time to be called. I highly recommend the third level as it was more of a view and if you have kids, the first level would be more ideal as it is on the ground and there are holes near the hitting area.   Prices aren't as crazy as one might think. There are different prices for different times of day and different levels. You pay by the hour and it doesn't matter if you're going solo or with a group of 8. The prices are what it is. If there are more than 3 people in your group I highly suggest going for at least 2 hours so everyone can get the full enjoyment. My group of 3 had two rounds of fun. You can either free range hit or they have various games you could play.   Service from the entrance to the exit was on point as well. All the employees were high spirited and more than helpful about anything we needed or needed to know.   Food and drinks were up there too. Me and my sister in law ordered a sangria and a margarita. We even got them in their golf bag cups which you can keep and who wouldn't want this cute souvenir especially since it light's up! And contrary to the over pour of liquor that most Strip venues tend to do, our drinks were perfect. We ordered their nacho stack with carne asada and their yellowtail sashimi with avocado ice cream. Yes, you read that right. AVOCADO.ICE.CREAM. i know you're mind is spinning right? Believe it or not, it was worth indulging in. The ice cream paired with the sashimi and thick ponzu sauce was SO GOOD, I was tempted to order another round of it. But I had a mountain of nachos I needed to finish (and didn't) first.   This is definitely a place to come and experience either as a group, family affair or even for date night. I mean any girl who is up for looking goofy and/or being competitive is a keeper right?",

Of course we were there in the most expensive time tier (5-10pm) and I had to have top tier (3rd floor) golf.  $75/hour and after first hour you can add on by 30 minute increments.    Each circle has layers and point values.  Closest goal was lowest points, farthest goals (for big hitters of course) highest points.  We were lucky enough to get the middle bay, so it was easier lining up our shots.    All scores are automatically recorded, like bowling is now.  The goals are big, huge, lighted holes filled with that bouncy, yellowish, pillow filler stuff (lol can't remember the name).  Then netting is over it and scores circles with in the huge hole.  Inside circle scores highest points, outer circles score lowest points.  Each person is charged $5 membership one time, which is added to the hourly.  You can shoot 5 balls each at a time or one at a time, your choice.  You can time everyone or not.  Very flexible and players choice.    Nice misting system combined with AC.  Comfy couches, left and right handed clubs for both men and women.  Pro golf shop with many options but mainly Calloway.   I was happy they had women's right handed gloves, for us lefties.  Ordered drinks and they have food too.  $44 for a bucket (6) of corona, $10 for a Moscow mule with call vodka.  All in all, I was very pleased with the experience and would go back for sure.  It helped that I hit well....you know golf, great score good day, bad score, crappy day.  Finally, we walked in and nobody was there.  By the time we left at 7:45, it was packed.  Lights come on and the entire atmosphere becomes Las Vegas inspired.  We had no wait, people at 7:30pm had a 30 minute wait, those at 8:00had an hour to wait.  Wait times shorter on levels 1 and 2.  By the way, we had super beginners and super golfers.  The people next to us had \"never golfed before\" friends.   FORE!!",

We spent most of our time in the lower deck where our party was, and the top was totally slammed. I would say our drinks would arrive within 10 minutes of ordering, which isn't bad considering how busy they were.   Overall awesome experience that now has be looking for a Topgolf in every city we visit. Love this place!",

If you go with a fun attitude and don't worry about being the best golfer, you'll enjoy it. Sometimes the computer games are difficult to follow, but it's a beautiful location, especially at night when everything is lit up. We've had the food here too and it's usually pretty good, nothing to complain about. Definitely a cool atmosphere but also something you can take the family to.",

I came on a weekday and it was pretty empty and no wait.  They have a large private parking lot. They are connected to MGM, about a 10 minute walk from the casino.   Service was nice and friendly. I liked how they warn you not to Happy Gilmore the balls into the field.   Drinks are not to expensive. Food is typical bar grub. They have shuffleboard for non golfers on the second level.  If you are left handed, like me, you have to ask for separate clubs.  If you never played there before you have to pay $5 for the membership card. Pretty stupid in my opinion.   Basically an entertaining version of the driving range with multiple levels. I played on the second level and thought it was a pretty cool view. You can see some of the strip. There are target holes in the hitting area for the games so you can collect points. It was fun for the first 5 minutes, then not so much. I am not a golfer so I was not to entertained. Awesome concept, just is not for me.  Avoid driving your cars in this area. If the balls sail over the net, they land on the street right in front.",

Sure the drinks are overpriced and everything here cost more than your average Topgolf but the experience and the views overlooking the strip more than worth it & I mean C'mon, it's Vegas.   I came to this Topgolf with a group of 9 people. We were told there would be a wait for a bay since we hadn't reserved prior to our arrival. We waited it out at the bar and in less than 20 minutes, we were directed to our designated area.   We had an awesome time. Our server was on it with drinks and quick. We were never without anything which was a plus. I loved the views and it's definitely a must-go if you're in Vegas. Good drinks, awesome service. Nighttime is the best time to stop by to catch that city-skline view (especially during summer time when it's in the dreadful triple-digits).",

    "text": "The customer service for Top Golf is seriously lacking and its unfortunate when it is outrageously expensive.  Last Wednesday for two kids and two adults for 90mins we spent 350.00 on appetizers and playing.  Thats a pretty hefty bill for just some playtime.  However, that is not my reasoning for the negative review.    Last Tuesday we arrived at Top Golf and too much of our surprise it was booked out in full for a group.  However, we understood because we didn't check ahead of time regarding any such events.   We did chose to return Wednesday and we had a blast even though the price could be better.    This week we have more company in town and wanted to go to Top Golf again.  On Tuesday at 3:27pm, we contacted Top Golf and were told it was open to the public that evening... Again we arrived, this time via UBER as we had 8 people in our group, only to find we were turned away for a group AGAIN.  I was very upset as we had already called and so I decided to write Corporate about the miscommunication as this became an expense as well to be turned away.  Well that was pointless as we received very generic response from \"Brittany\".  They'll \"strive to do better\".    So as I would love to never give Top Golf another penny of my money, we are AGAIN being bugged by our teenagers to please go tonight with our party of 8.... Well again, I called at 1:46 to be talked down to by a lady implying we were stupid for asking for a clear \"Yes or No\" answer on if there were any group closures tonight and then rudely hung up on.  It is really unfortunate this is how they want to do business and from one business owner to another,  Sounds like the customer service went out the window.   We were planning on booking sections during our visit for our NYE company party and now will be going elsewhere as after this final trip tonight, IF THEY ARE EVEN OPEN, we will not be returning again!  Update: Received email back from \"Brittany\" at Guest Car Team after my 3rd correspondence, they will be closing at 9:30 tonight for a party... Well thank you for letting us know after so much wasted time and energy.  We still will not be returning after tonight as we do not want to disappoint our group.",

We didn't even have to wait an hour before we were called up for level 1 golf. During that time we drank and played shuffle board... not too bad.

Great music, good food, full-service bar, big-screen TVs with sports playing on every TV, a swimming pool and golf! This place is a guy's paradise, but can be easily enjoyed by women. This is like a bowling alley on anabolic steroids!  We came on a Sunday evening for a friend's birthday and put our name in to hit some golf balls. Took about 30 mins to find us a table. During our wait, we decided to take a dip in their pool and order drinks poolside! So dope! Once you get your table, you get a server who'll bring you drinks and food.They have a variety of games for everyone to enjoy once your at your table. I recommend the \"scramble.  If i had to pick nits, it would be the pricing. It's about $75/hour and you'll have so much fun, it's easy to forget about the time. Our party of eight rang up a $400 tab, but everyone was able to hit some balls and get a full belly and nice buzz. This would be the perfect place to host a fantasy football draft or just spend football sundays. In fact, it's a perfect place to arch any major sporting event. We'll definitely recommend Top Golf to our friends and undoubtedly return to hit some balls! FOOOOUR Stars!!",

We decided to chill in the bar and get some food and drinks while we waited and had great service there. At the two hour mark we were told another 20 minutes, which was okay. Eventually they told us we could get a bay on the first floor which we decided to take rather than wait longer, and it was all downhill from there. We got to the bay and were immediately like 'Hey it's kinda fucking cold down here' because they had misters on FULL BLAST and AC over the whole bay. We asked if they could be turned off and they said they would ask. 15 minutes in and they were still on and we were still cold so we found a button for a heater and turned that on and started to warm up. All was well, or so we thought. Shortly after they came over and turned the heater off because it was a fire hazard to be on at the same time as the misters, and were then told that the misters were not able to be turned off. A few questions at this point: Why are the misters not able to be individually controlled by bay like the heaters are? Why is there not a control system that doesn't let the heater be turned on at the same time as the misters if it is such a hazard? Anyways the girl said she'd double check with her manager since we were so uncomfortable. The manager came by shortly after and all I can say is wow - what a bitch. Essentially the root of the conversation was that there was nothing they could do and the misters were either on or off for all bays on the floor - totally fine except the way she conveyed this information was not in a friendly or apologetic way that I would expect from someone handing bad news to a paying customer. She pointed out that it was the middle of summer and 93 degrees out, but also admonished us for not bringing jackets as if we should have expected to be blasted by cold water. She also told us that we 'wouldn't want' them to be off despite the fact that we were shivering and unanimously agreed that we would have a more pleasant experience with them off. With all this I decided that to warm up I would order another drink, but unfortunately I was out of luck there too. I tried for 20 minutes to no avail to grab the attention of one of the girls, even going so far as to stand behind our bay in the walkway where several were passing by but my efforts were fruitless. We decided not to extend our time given the unpleasantness of our experience and I wish I could say that that's where this ended but just about the second after we closed out our bay and started packing up, at precisely 11:51 pm, the misters shut off in what can only be described as the biggest 'fuck you' we could have received from an establishment where we had just spent a few hundred dollars. Well, fuck you too Vegas Top Golf - we won't be recommending you to anyone soon.",

    "text": "Love Topgolf Vegas overall but this is a very pricey venue and can sticker shock you if you play , eat, and drink for 2 hours. Alas though, it is VEGAS! It really helps to bring a local where 20% off awaits you and to play early where prices are much lower. The food here is pretty good with typical bar finger food . Burgers are ok , sea bass sliders are really good, wings typical bar fare, rock shrimp ok, flatbreads not bad, and the steak is very good. We have tried the BBq cabana meal when we had a group with us and I would avoid that selection and spend $100+ more bucks on the Cabana mixed grill! The Mixed grill was very good. Speciality cocktails are just ok here, with prices hitting $30 for 2. Buy a bucket of beer to save a few bucks . A sportsbook is actually located in this location but it is not always staffed. Great viewing areas for watching sports .  Lounges and a cool swimming pool are located on top floor as well. Its pretty dang cool. DJ's play all summer Fri-Sun. Great places to hold meetings for customers as well. Very friendly bartenders and servers. Friendly greeters too. There is even ping pong and cornhole to play. One huge tip !!  Play the video poker machines at the bar!  They spit out free drink tickets as you play!!  We played for over 2 hours and had a blast with bartenders last visit!! Fun place to bring a bigger group!! Cheers.",

Then I tried to call to see if they would be open to public on Friday night and I never got a call back.   Finally I emailed the group sales and got an email back.",

Im ok with mandatory valet, but it takes 20+ minutes to get your car. They'll start treating people better once its no longer new amd the crowds come down I hope.",

I'll make sure not to recommend clients there in the future  - Quality of clubs are pretty terrible. For $75/hr my friend's club shouldn't break in half and the left-handed clubs were made for someone maybe 5' 7\"??  - Service was spotty. Ordered a beer and because it's in an aluminum bottle, it took my server a good 30 minutes until I found her to order another. ALSO! I don't like the pressure of adding another hour of play while I was there. Someone came up to us and disrupted our game every 5-10 minutes asking us if we wanted to add another hour. BUZZ OFF.   - I guess I just don't understand the entire vibe. There's a pool, there's bar games, there's golf... the problem is there's a million places inVegas that you can do this as a quarter of the price.",

We were told there was a 45 minute to 1 hour wait, which was fine (there is plenty to do while you wait). We bought two rounds of drinks and played corn hole to pass the time. 1 hour later, I checked with the front desk and was told there were still 5 groups ahead of us. The girl at the front then pulled me aside and said, \"to be honest, we're so backed up because our staff doesn't want to do anything tonight.\"   Classy.  There were plenty of bays open so we decided to stick it out. After 2 hours of waiting I checked with the front desk once again. This time I was told there is only one group in front of us. 20 minutes later and our group had enough so we left.   Only positive was that we Ubered and didn't have to deal with the horrid valet service mentioned in most of the reviews on here.   Won't be returning to this location. Ever.",

There seemed to be more employees than guest initially, but by the time we left, it was pretty busy.  The hourly game selection at different rates for blocks of times during the day, initially seemed a bit overwhelming so I sat back and let my friends decide.  Our party of 5 fit nicely in the bay.  We ordered, Rockin Shrimp, a burger, pulled pork sliders and a pizza that were all very yummy.  I was starving, so I forgot to snap pics of the food.... next time!  I too will visit the adult only floors as I later found that I missed out on the pools, etc. The teens in the group enjoyed there rounds of hitting the balls.  We will certainly return and next time after dark to enjoy the night lights! - Our hostess and helper were friendly and decently attentive, except when our time was up.... they wanted us OUT!  ;-/  - I'll know better of what to expect next time!!!  1 hour of play $60 for 3 peeps.  Previously listed food and 3 sodas - $80. My friend paid for the play and I paid for the food.  Now that I think about it, I only tipped on the food... I hope that I didn't gip the girl!?!",

    "text": "Came here on a Thursday evening with my boyfriend and two friends. Haven't been to top golf before so I was pretty excited. We purchase 1 hour for $60. First of all, when you get to your hitting bay, they make each person in your party sign up on the computer.   THEY START YOUR TIME RIGHT WHEN YOU BEGIN TO SIGN UP.  First of all, it takes FOREVER. The computer was saying error for some reason and in total it took almost 15 minutes for all of us to register before even starting to play yet.  We ask someone about it and they said it shouldn't start until you hit your first ball.  But it did. And they didn't do anything about it. We asked different people too. Wtf? That's extra time that we could have to play.   So then. We're playing for a bit. I order a Guinness  and my friend ordered a Heineken from one employee that came over. TWENTY minutes later a different person comes over and says oh you guys ordered a Guinness and Heineken right? We say yes. 10 minutes later, a different girl comes back and says so you guys ordered a Guinness  and Heineken? And we were like yeah but never mind now our time is up cancel our order.   What the f??   So now our time is up and I'm sitting here super upset. We've been waiting for our check for the longest time. Then, this girl finally comes over and says, \"oh are you guys done? Let me bring your check.\"   TWENTY MINUTES LATER;  a DIFFERENT girl comes over and says hey is everything okay? And I'm like no nothing is okay. I've had a horrible time here. Then a new group of people come over to our hitting bay because they're playing there. And we're sitting down chillin waiting for our check. Then we get kicked out and have to go stand. Why accept a new group to the hitting bay if we didn't even get to pay yet? We have been waiting for SO long.   So on top of how mad we already are we are even more furious that we can't even get a check and leave.  DO NOT COME HERE. Go to a different golf range.",

So be prepared to wait about an hour or two, but it didn't seem like it took too long because the venue was really welcoming. It was a nice place to just sit around, chill, catch up with others, and watch people golf.   Our golfing area was on the first floor and farthest left, so we didn't really get much of a view as we were mostly facing away from the strip.  It was my first time playing golf and I sucked at it, but it didn't even matter! It was fun anyways. Even my little nieces and nephews had a great time playing golf (they're under 10 years). So this is definitely the place for any age with experience or no experience.    The place gives a relaxing/chill vibe, and the golfing range looked pretty. The service here was great, they were always attending to us and refilling beer/ providing water. The food was good, a little small on the portions and kinda pricey, but it's the quality you're paying for.   Golfing isn't really my forte, but if I were invited to come here again I wouldn't say no!",

FYI: topgolf does have their own parking lot and no cost! If you go from the mgm and take the shuttle be sure to go to the lobby to catch it. Do not follow signs for topgolf.  The staff was nice and explained how to play. The hour went so fast but we had a lot of fun. If you don't finish a game before the time runs out the score disappears so you can't get a picture.",

The Las Vegas Top Golf is so top notch as well with 4 floors, 2 pools, many big screens, and shuffleboard.  For $60 you get a bay for an hour, with up to 6 players.  But you can sit a full party down at each bay.  Drinks and food are pricey, with drinks in the $8 range for beer and $12 for drinks, and food around $15.  Overall I like Top Golf and will most definitely be back, hopefully for social events as prices seem to get out of hand when in tahat golf zone.",

To find TG , which was frustrating because abour   2  hours later when we left , it was up and runnng.  (The directions and signs were kind of confusing as were the baracades )  Kind of sucked because I have asthma and try not to walk in the heat.  There really is not a restaurant, you just sit were ever . Try to find a menu and wait for someone to notice you .. ( I had to go to thr bar to ask for help).  Our waiteess/bartender BRIDGET was AMAZINGLY helpful , she  was VERY patient in helping out with me being a vegan. ( no dairy , no meat).  I ordered the flat bread pizza with peaches and candied pecans (no cheese) , it was quite tasty.  Hubby and child had a bacon cheese burger , it was cooked a little over done for M . more like MW and dry.  I think  this was a ONE time thing. Sorry guys , the whole experience was just ok for me.

    "text": "You have to know what you are doing when you come here. Read every single TripAdvisor suggestion you can. And then your experience may surpass mine, if you are lucky and smart.  Tip #1) IF you bring your teenagers, DON'T go above the 2nd floor with them or you will be immediately and rudely greeted by a server who is barely 21 himself that will promptly tell you to get lost and go back to the lower floors since upper floors are 21 and older only, for the ENTIRE floor. This is True even if you come at the beginning of March, on a Tuesday at 2 pm when nobody else is there on the entire floor.   Tip #2) That prompt, rude, barely 21 year old that met you on the 3rd floor with your teenagers THE SPLIT SECOND before you could even sit down? Well, don't let the fact that he was so quick fool you about the actual service you should expect to receive here. Once we took the elevator back down to the under 21 level, it was a full 20 minutes until anyone thought about asking us if we even wanted a cool glass of water on this sunny 90 degree day. Not for lack of trying on our part! Trust me, we watched countless over 21 year olds even walk up to the bar in this level and try to order even their own ANYTHING and they were instantly told by the little blonde bartender that the server was way over on the other side of the room where she pointed and that she would be there to take our orders soon. Not to be deterred, I myself even went over and asked and was told the same thing. Then, I made eye contact more than 3 times, each time more seriously than the next, with other servers who walked about 24 inches from my face yet refused to look at or acknowledge me. I'm not sure who trains the servers here but they should all be fired for not even saying hello or sorry for ignoring you on this hot day in March. It was only after I texted the manager of the place that we at least were able to order. But this was a full 30 minutes after the 5 of us sat in a nearly empty and conspicuous area looking super hot, thirsty and hungry at 3:30 pm on a Tuesday in March.  Tip #3) Still reading? So everyone has ordered, finally some refreshing drinks arrive at the table 45 minutes after arrival. But wait! Only the kids sodas arrive! Hubby's and my pitcher of beer that we knew we had to order because we were unsure when we would ever see the waitress again in the next hour ... they happened to be changing out the Stella tap at the very moment our waitress asked for the pitcher. Ugh! So she couldn't even bring us some waters as a standby til the beer arrived, which I really needed by this time. I'm getting a headache just writing this... long story short nearly an hour after arriving, our beer and our food arrived at the exact same time! Yay!  Tip #4) Except for the burgers, you don't get much for your $. But hey! You never should have come here to eat in the first place! DUH! I got 3 tinee tiny Korean style tacos for like $14. I'm a tiny eater too, and my hubby and I ALWAYS split meals but altogether, end to end, I'd say these were the size of a regular sized Taco Bell taco, and I generally order 2 of those to feel full if that tells you anything:  I could go on... but there was a single silver lining to the whole experience... after all this, my husband and 14 year old golfing fanatics (because we live on a golf course in San Francisco) were able to get right into a Bay hit some balls. Of course by now it cos $60 per hour instead of $45. But then an extra $15 is nothing to us in San Francisco. In fact it is more than the tip we gave our MIA waitress after ordering $150 worth of food, which would have been double the order if she had come by any sooner than 45 minutes AFTER we arrived and sat down in her station where nobody else was at 2 pm on Tuesday on March 14, 2017.",

    "text": "So I've never been to a driving range. I would say for driving range this place would automatically get a 5. It has a cool technology that tracks your ball which is awesome for someone that can hit a ball about 50 yards. We had to wait a few hours for a spot. So we watched the insane tvs (since it was impossible to get drink service) and played cornhole.  But obviously I'm no pro but I'm a solid drinker. I would say they have the worst service. It was a good thing I snuck several drinks in with me. It was actually purely accident I had them on me. But at least I had something to drink when the server wasn't around. Margaritas are great so I would recommend. Being gluten free, I was told the only thing I could get would be the burger. Which is disappointing from food options but it was decent.  I would go back just for the driving range with friends again (if I'm in Vegas). Plus I had to pay for a membership. Not sure why...",

    "text": "Wow! I had so much fun! There are 4 levels. Prices vary from $60-$90 per hour depending on time and day of the week. I went on a Saturday so it was pretty packed.  I visited levels 2-4. Level 1 is geared more towards families. Level 2 has corn hole, bar and live music. Level 3 has a really nice pool and lounging area. Level 4 has a nice view, pool and bar. It makes sense that the higher you go the more expensive it is, but I do think that the higher price is warranted for the extra goodies at each level. We ended up on level 2 for golfing and in the middle. I recommend that you have groups of 6 since that is the max per bay so that if you had the $60 price then it would be $10 per person. The middle has the least amount of view obstruction and you seem to have more options for targets to hit. You do not need to dress in \"golf attire\" like some people think. I saw people walking in with just bikini's and others dressed like they were ready to play 18 holes. It is very casual. I was wearing a dress and flip flops. We ordered a bunch of food and drinks too. I really liked the sea bass sliders for $15. I stopped by for my birthday and I believe they should offer a free dessert on birthdays! The Alcohol infused donuts are a bit odd, but also delicious. It would be nice if you could reserve ahead of time online or have an idea of how packed it is before stopping by. Oh and make sure you ask for proper golf grip and hold on to your clubs. I saw a few down on the course.",

They have multiple levels that groups of up to six can rent a section per hour. If you're having lots of fun you can extend your time in 15 minute increments. Its a driving range that has multiple targets that you can aim to get points. Each golf ball has a chip inside so it can detect how close you are to the target. The computer screen will let you know where the ball went if you lose track.The closer you are to the target the more points you receive. Everything is electronic, and the clubs are all provided. It's for all level of golfers. Each area that you rent comes with a couch and table so you can order food and drinks while waiting your turn. The earlier in the day you go the cheaper it is. As expected weekends are more than weekdays. Wait time for us was around 30 minutes. They also provide a shuttle to and from the MGM casino. If you go earlier in the day you can self park for free right in front but after a certain hour it is valet parking. If you're losing a lot of money on Vegas it's a good alternative to take a break from the casinos.",

    "text": "I learned about Top Golf because they are building one in my area which is scheduled to open on September 3rd. So, when I found out there was a Top Golf in Vegas I was excited to try it out. I'm an avid golfer and the people with me golf sometimes. Although, that does not really matter here, because the whole idea is to just have a fun time. Almost everybody around us was either not regular golfers or never swung a club in their life; and everybody was having so much fun. The staff was friendly and helpful. My only complaint was it was hard to hear the woman at the main check-in counter, partly because her voice was not that strong, but also because the accoustics in the main entrance/check-in counter are not that good. It was to noisy, which made it hard to hear. The gentleman who explained the games and how things worked did a pretty good job. He went kind of fast, but the system was intuitive enough where we were able to work ourselves through it while we were playing. The clubs kind of suck, but what do you expect for a place like this? For someone who does'nt normally golf, they are fine, for someone who plays even a few times a year you're better off bringing your own clubs. My only real complaint about the golfing was the rubber tee. It was fine for all the clubs except the driver, since it was only about less than 1/2\" tall. It makes hitting the driver very difficult, even for a decent golfer. Anyway, overall a very good experience and I can't wait until the Top Golf near me opens.",

The experience they create from the time you walk in until you leave is so personable. We were escorted every step of the way and our server, Deven, was attentive without being overbearing. There are so many different golf games to choose from and for all experience levels. We played level three to be away from kids. The only thing I would recommend is if they could put privacy screens between each lounge area it would make the experience less of a community event. I would defiantly go again!",

It could be that they didn't know where anything was,first time using the computer,had never had a crowd, Im not sure,it could be all of the above. As a bartender,it was painful to watch. Service at 2nd floor bar was a bit better. At least they looked like they were trying. I'm not sure why two vodka drinks were $22 at one bar and $17 and change at another. I'm 99% sure I was up sold without asking. I'm not a fan of that hustle.   The facility was new and very nice. I like the set up for the show,we stood just a few feet from the stage.

Customer service at this place has been a billion times better the very first time I came here but I went last night and it was absolutely horrendous. I was excited to bring my girl here and have a good time because I us so much fun the first time and now I will never return here again. Nor will I recommend it to anyone else.   We were completely ignored from the time we agreed to wait 2 hrs for a space at the initial entrance all the way through to the end when my waiter didn't realize that I had already been a member and she double charged me for a top golf card (even after I showed her My card) our food was cold and sloppy (unfortunately I had been waiting until we got there to eat so I was pretty hungry)    Prior to getting our golf space, me and my girlfriend waited at (non-busy) bar for about 20 solid minutes, then we sat in front of the very large TVs in the seating and dining area for 45 mins until I was fed up and asked one of the workers how to get service here (like it was some code you needed to know in order to get service) once I asked, it then took and additional 30 minutes to be helped.   Once we were finally waited on (because I literally stopped one of the waiters and ASKED if me and my girlfriend could eat) she said \"are you ready to order now?, because if you're not then give me about 10-15 minutes to come and see you guys\"   Luckily we'd been waiting a long time so we had our orders ready (Thank God) once our orders came, we were called to our golf spot.  So of course we had to have our food brought up to the third floor. That service alone was $75. I didn't mind paying out a good amount of money because it was date night and there is no monetary limit when I'm treating my woman but that (on top of the $121.00 for golfing for a total of about $200) was probably one of the wasteful ways to spend my money.   10/13/16   Since my last visit to Top Golf I must say their mistake was fully recovered by the staff with tremendous hospitality. Our experience was phenomenal this time and we fully enjoyed ourselves. And a special thanks to  their management team for responding to us with such humility and respect. Thank you!",

What mattered was the kids had a wonderful time as it was their first experience hitting golf balls other than just the backyard. This propelled my daughter to want her own set of clubs and go to the regular driving range as well.  Anyways, our host was great. She brought more water and juice when our glasses were needed of refills. We just had drinks and the nachos which was satisfying, considering I'm not a nachos type of person. But everyone else liked it as well.  Everyone receives their own card to use in the future. Has your record of games played and I'm guessing how you fare in the games. Gee thanks. But there are many games to play and varieties of scoring. Each booth has both women and men's clubs, as well as children size if needed.  Although we visited in the morning, we'll try to come at night when the targets are lit. But for the most part, we had a great time. Think of when you go bowling, and you're in your own section, having fun, drinking, eating, etc. But golf on Red Bull. Can't wait to go back. Thank you.",

The driver had no clue what Topgolf was which is pretty surprising since it's the hottest thing in Vegas right now so she dropped us at the MGM Grand. Not ideal, but there is a shuttle or plenty of signs in the hotel to guide you to TopGolf.  We arrived on a Friday at 11:30 AM and were immediately taken to the bay of our choice (we chose to play on the highest level which is 3 but this costs extra). I was so surprisd there was no wait from all the horror stories I read on here. They set up your Topgolf membership and give you a tour of the bay before leaving you to it. The bay is sooo nice with everything you could want: charging stations, plush seating, your own set of mens/womens clubs, drinks/food that can be ordered from the waitress assigned to your bay, and heaters! My husband and I played for two hours and tried a couple of the games. We also ordered the pulled pork sliders, the rock shrimp, s'more cookie things and 4 drinks. The pulled pork sliders were good but I wasn't a fan of the rock shrimp (wanted the sauce to be stronger) or s'more cookies (cookies were not soft enough). We would definitely come back here in a heartbeat even though it's pretty pricey. We just wish there was one by us but then you would not get those fabulous Vegas views as you practice!",

I had no idea that so much was going on at this place. Tons of fun for golfers and non-golfers alike. We had teens and grandmothers playing it was so much fun.  Food was to die for. How can wings and meat skewers be so good? I don't know but they were frickin' awesome and I'm a wing connoisseur.  The cost for 10 people, 1-3/4 hours, food and drinks - $540. Well worth it. Next time I will opt for the 4th level suites. Great for a family outing or a company event.  Why the four stars? Check-in had to be done in person hours before we were ready because the wait was two-hours. Not ideal, call-in reservations guaranteed by credit card would be better. Nice thing was that they called or texted you when they were ready for you so you could go back to the casino or wherever. However, when we got on the waiting list they told us we could have the bay for at least two-hours and longer if needed. But when we showed up they had another event booked which forced us to end early and rush a bit. Can't finish two games in that amount of time. It was annoying but still a five-star experience.  You have to go to Top Golf, can't wait til they get one in San Diego.",

They serve food and drinks that you can order and enjoy while waiting for your turn to tee off.    The downside is there is usually a wait as it is a popular spot.  But you can go to the bar, play cornhole, or watch the sports on their jumbo screen.    The pricing is decent if you have a larger group as they charge you per hour for the bay and allow up to six people in each bay.  The more people the cheaper but the less time you get so the more hours you may want to play.  Overall a fun place to go, give it a try and have fun!",

We sat downstairs and started drinking their overly expensive drinks right away (their bucket of beers is beer in CANS, talk about classy). And this was maybe the only acceptable part of the night as the downstairs area had corn hole and tvs and seats available.   They called us to our golf place upstairs so we started to walk there and sat down, deciding who would be playing the top golf. During this time we ordered the overly expensive food and drinks, like drinks just for 6 people alone were $100+ a round. After we ordered we had someone come up to us and tell us that we needed to purchase another table/golf area because we had more than 6 people?! Um yeah we had 6 people total who wanted to play, the rest of us were just hanging out and drinking.... and on top of that they kept saying it was a fire hazard, but the table next to us had 3 people there and they didn't care and said we could be a part of their group. So we had to have 2 people go inside to the bar because only 10 people were allowed at the hitting cage, so it sucked because we paid to be split up from the rest of our group! And the worst part was the group next to us was ok with us standing there and the cage to the other side was empty.  Don't go here, they nickel and dime you and the food is average at best, the drinks are beyond expensive and the service sucks.",

    "text": "It's unfortunate that I have to give a 2 star review because for the most part it was a great experience considering this was all My only complaint is with the customer service from a sales rep. I called on April 8 to check pricing for premier reservations for later that night and was told that the sales rep would give me a call back. I received a call but unfortunately I couldn't understand his name. The over the phone experience wasn't the issue. He explained that there was $100 fee per hour and a 2 drink minimum per person. I told him have a group of 6 people. He followed up with saying that everything would be a total of $330. I asked by repeating \"so everything is gonna be a total of $330,\" to just make sure. He then said yes. So I went ahead and booked a reservation for later that night. When we arrived I went to the private event desk and told the person that was helping us that we had an appointment. He looked it up and then told me it was $100 per hour. He then said that the drink and food minimum would be $330. I was surprised, so I asked for clarification. He repeated the prices. I then was trying say that the guy I talked to on the phone told me everything was $330 before he interrupted me and said, \"well that was me and I didn't say that,\" with rude tone. So I looked at my family who I was with and discussed it with them. My uncle asked how much it was if we just waited for the 3rd floor without a reservation. He told us the prices and we finally decided to do that. So I looked back at the rep and told him we were just going to do the normal rates for the 3rd floor. He then just crumbled up our reservation info and didn't even acknowledge me. This one sales rep left a bad impression of this location.  Even with the bad start, we eventually had a great time. Their was giant monitors, few Cornhole setups, a couple of shuffle boards, and of course a bar in the waiting area while we waited. Then another employee showed us up to our bay, explained the rules and how everything works, along with where things were. The customer service from the employee that showed us our bay and the waitress were excellent. Although it was a little pricey for everything, we thought it was well worth the experience. We look forward to trying Topgolf again although we might consider going to another location which is inconvenient because we live in southern California and this is probably the closest one. If not for one employee's unprofessional behavior, this could have easily been a 5 star review.",

If you hate your job, quit. Don't make your guest feel like they need to be rich and tip you to have a good time. You should give the same service regardless of price paid. I was offered floor 3 as a parting gift to waiting almost two hours for one swing. I will surely spread the news. If your on vacation, save your time for something more fun that won't have you waiting for 2 hours to swing a golf club at a night club.  Thanks nick for comping my $20 tab that was still charged to my card. Thanks for taking an extra 20 minutes to close out my tab because you guys were called on unprofessional customer service. If your on vacation, and you saw the hype of this experience beforehand as I did, let this review be a reality check. You will wait a while. Something the front desk has a very hard time being honest about.",

Hard to go to another Top Golf after going to the Vegas location. Other entertainment/games while you wait for a bay to be open and a lot of fun overall. I could easily go here every trip to Vegas. Did I mention the night view with the lights is amazing!?",

Just get two bays if you have more than 6 people.  The food is amazing!!!! Please go for the back yard wings, rock shrimp and the donut holes for dessert-- they will blow your mind!  I love how the first and second level are for all ages and the third and fourth level is for 21+. It makes it more of a party atmosphere!  This place is perfect to hang out with friends, a a date, with family and/friends. I love it and I'm so happy something like this is in Las Vegas!!!",

    "text": "YES! As good as it gets!  I mean, I don't even play golf and I had a blast.  It's just ridiculously fun.  Essentially it's a driving range, but it's that and so much more.  There are a couple bags of various clubs (5s to 9s, as I recall, no woods) to use.  There are RFID chips in the balls, so each player can track their shots.  There are a variety of targets, both close in and far away, to shoot for.  A computer keeps score.  When you hit a target a computer display shows where your ball ended up.   I can barely hit a golf ball.  About half of my swings totally miss the ball.  But I was still able to hit the targets quite a few times.  I even got one right in the center of the blue target (175 yds) for 40 points.    Neophytes need not worry, you really don't even have to know how to swing a club.  You'll figure it out.  Real golfers will dig Topgolf in a major way.  You can program the computer a dozen different ways to set up competitions between you and your friends.    We rented a bungalow bay for my niece's birthday party.  She uses a wheelchair and access was easy through a side entrance, and an elevator was available to take us to the fourth floor.  The bay came with a server, who was outstanding.    Food and drinks were brought out continuously.  And damn, that food was TASTY.  We had so many crazy things it was impossible to try them all.  Highlights were the shrimp (breaded and deep fried, sort of like orange chicken but shrimp), the sushi (surprisingly good sushi!), and the kabob/skewer thingees (chicken, pork and beef).  There was pulled pork and a lot of other stuff I didn't get around to.  Dang, almost forgot to mention the dessert!  They make a pudding cup that kicks ASS.  In fact, even if you don't want to golf, you should stop by and try this pudding if you are anywhere near the MGM.  Wow!  This isn't the pudding mix your mom used to make.  This is the real deal.    If you are visiting Las Vegas and are looking for something different to do, I would highly recommend Topgolf.  Great party venue.  Great gift idea.  Mikey C says:  yay Topgolf!",

    "text": "Topgolf takes everything good and great about every driving range you've ever been to, puts it all together and serves it up in a sleek, modern package.  The place has style and I would not be surprised if it catches on in other locations besides Las Vegas.   Whether you come for a quick lunch break or stay for an afternoon, there's everything you could need all in one place.  Full bar? Check. Attractive waitresses and good service? Check. Clubs right at the tee? Check.  Automatic ball dispenser? Check.  Electronic tracking of score? Check. It's pretty much the peak of modern golfing technology catering to the customer.  I'm not an avid golfer and don't get the chance to play all that much, so there might be some points I've missed that more serious types might notice. All I know is that I had a really good time for a couple of hours that passed by very quickly.   Basically there are three levels of the driving range with the third floor being the top. The third floor not only gives you the best view of the course and the targets, but also the best driving angle so your drives go that much farther. It cost a little bit more to be on the top floor, but I would say that it's worth it.  As mentioned above they have a digital tracking system kind of like bowling but a bit newer and more high-tech. It keeps track of how many balls each person gets through the automatic dispenser, which is activated when you wave the golf club over the sensor. Once it automatically spits out a ball, the system tracks and registers where you hit the ball on the course.  If you haven't been to Topgolf, they have a \"game\" of sorts where you can attempt to aim for different areas on the driving range to score points. The farther ones being worth more points, and consecutive hits in targets doubling your score.  It makes for a fun competition when you aren't golfing alone. Thanks to the electronic tracking system if you are with a group of friends you can have a good time without having to worry about keeping track of points.  There are also several varieties different games you can play including total points scored or more skill specific games where you aim for certain targets.  Overall Topgolf is a real hit in my opinion and is definitely worth checking out if you like to visit driving ranges or just want to have a good time in a different way.",

It would be amazing if you had a larger group to go but still wonderful if there are a couple of you. It can get a bit pricey around the peak times but the food and alcohol are adequately priced so there's no complaints there. Although it doesn't help your golf game when you've wagered a bunch of money on football and have to watch your team get destroyed on the gigantic screens in the distance haha. We ordered the Jumbo Pretzel Board and the Asian Sesame Wings. I would have both again but I would for sure recommend the Jumbo Pretzel Board. Looking forward to the next Topgolf experience.",

Even though you're paying more for the top floor, it does come with premium clubs.   We came around 10am to get the cheapest rate for the day and we were able to walk right in. After a couple of hours when we were done, there was a massive line and pretty much all of the bay's were full.   On the third and fourth floor there is even a swimming pool. Since we went during winter, it was closed at that time, but it was just like a Vegas day club. They also have a couple of shuffle board tables and a corn hole available to play with on the second floor. It does get petty busy at those games as well so either come early or be prepared to wait.",

It was duable if you switch out players, which they let you do. When the TopGolf lady helped us add our names to the topgolf video game program to play golf, that took quite forever because they couldn't add the 6th player. For some reason, a 6th player from a previous game stayed on this list of our game and couldn't be deleted. Thanks \"Trenai Wilson\" who ever you are. Anyway, we just used his name and for some reason that username had the worst service getting the ball to be retrieved to play. It was quite the task. Then when we did get the ball, the ball did not get detected for that one username. It was very much a kill joy in the game. Everyone else was having an OK time, but a lot of time was wasted on this random user name.   Aside from the problem, the establishment is very nice with TV's literally everywhere. A huge movie sized screen in the lobby area and then 3 huge ones facing where you hit. It was awesome.   It is like experiencing a very fancy bowling alley, but for golf. The general format is as if you're in a bowling alley, but golf is the game.   I tried some of the food and it's AOK. There is some kinks this place needs to fix because it will be awesome. Possibly have flashing lights when the ball goes in. There are many things for this place to be so much better and make it feel like you are immersed in the game. I think I would have to try it again, maybe, but as an on an off golfer, I'd rather play real golf. Thanks for the experience. Thanks for the experience.",

    "text": "My 100th review!!!  My very first visit to top golf was on Tuesday, February 21, 2017. I brought my 16-year-old and 37-year-old with me on the night that I visited for the first time.   The facility was extremely busy as there were a lot of private parties. I believe there was some sort of a convention going on during the same week. therefore, a lot of these companies invited their convention attending guests to enjoy themselves at top golf. Many of the bays were occupied. I thought that there were not enough staff on hand to accommodate such large groups. One thing that is nice is that there are other games that can be played during the time that you may spend waiting for your bay to become available. If you are lucky enough to be on the premises during open hours, you can go down to the first floor to have yourself fitted for clubs. That is kind of a fun area. You can learn a lot about yourself, the way you swing, and what would be best for you.   The hourly rates in the evenings are pretty expensive if you ask me. It can cost the same amount to go and golf a full round, a full 18, during peak hours. During the day, the prices are not as bad. If by chance you happen to know a local, you should definitely bring them along with you as they may be able to get a discount for you.  From their pro shop, you can find all kinds of merchandise. You can find things as small as ball markers, to small towels Chapstick, charging banks for your phone, to things like pullover sweatshirts or hats. Under armor seems to be their #1 clothing brand. You'll find a number of UA apparel with the Top Golf logo on it. I think the one thing that I may go back for is a baseball cap. Disappointingly, it is not one that says top golf on it. I believe it is a Callaway hat. Still, I like the color and I think it will be great for spring time. with a new little one in our family, I am always looking for a cute little onesies or things like that to buy for the baby. I did find one, it was the cutest thing. I just don't know that I want to spend that much on something so small that they will grow out of so quickly.   I understand that this business is new here in Las Vegas but I did feel that my expectations were not met. It was difficult for us to get a waitress. She was not able to replenish our drinks very quickly. I felt like she needed my assistance but didn't have any. I do not blame her at all. I just feel like maybe the facility was not expecting to be slammed with so many people so quickly and therefore they did not have enough staff on hand. Eventually, I am sure it is something that they will figure out.   My 17-year-old and 37-year-old had a lot of fun. They played several games within the first hour. I thought about extending the time for another hour but decided that maybe they would go and play some of those other games that they have available. The other games that are available someone you're a bar area include shuffleboard and corn hole.   Corn hole is something that we have at home. And so, it was the game of choice because of its familiarity. Unfortunately, there were several drunk folks playing corn hole next to us. Because of that, they were splashing drinks around. Things are getting wet with alcohol. And people were just being kind of clumsy & sloppy. Although I brought this to the attention of one of the workers at the facility, they were not really able to do much about the sloppy guess. They only ask that they try and put their drinks down on a table instead of holding it in their hands while playing different games. That worked for a little bit, but of course, being drunk and a lot more forgetful the drinks in hand while playing corn hole resumed. It became so bad that we discontinued our game and just left to play shuffle board.   Shuffle board was also a bit of a challenge. The board conditions were not the best. The playing pieces were not real well taken care of. The sand that should've been on the board was everywhere. And of course, Some people had used the out of bounds areas from the shuffleboard table as a drink holder. And of course, alcohol was spilled and the sand ended up wet, sludge-like and was not something you could play on. Drunk folks tried to slide their drinks over the board from one end of the table to the other. Hmmm, not cool.   As mentioned earlier, waiter or waitress service was very difficult to get, but when we did get service it was great. Not all the waiters or waitresses know too much about the menu or their offerings. The presentation of some of the desert is not the best, although they initially seem like a lot of fun. The problem that we had was with their donut holes. I guess we read it wrong. But when we received them, the donuts were ones that we had to inject with their own feelings, like Bavarian cream, chocolate, and raspberry. They were good and everything, but they were extremely messy, got everywhere.   Fun & a bit expensive but great for first timers",

    "text": "Always a great time here, whether you are a golfer or have never swung a club in your life! It's a very casual environment that is approachable for any skill set. Not to mention that there are also some great bar seats, lounge seating and even other activities to keep you busy if you don't want to get a hitting bay (can be pricey during peak hours, but don't forget to ask for the locals discount on bay rentals if you have a Vegas ID!). They have corn-hole setup right in front of the big screen in the atrium, they have cabanas and a small pool with cocktail servers on one of the upper levels, and gaming at the bars on each floor!  The food is also unexpectedly incredible! I am a big fam of the grilled edamame that has a nice citrus flavor to it and their sea bass sliders are one of my favorites that I order every visit! Not affordable enough to come here regularly but a great spot for a special celebration or get together with friends- having lots of people helps spread the bay rental cost out as well!",

The girl I spoke to said they dont have pool cabanas. I said YES you do. She said ok hold on. I was on hold for several minutes. She comes back and says OH yeah we have a pool but its closed and we dont know when it will be open. I say \"YES your pool is open this weekend. CHECK YOUR WEBSITE ITS OPEN.\" She puts me on hold for several minutes AGAIN and says \"Oh yeah its open so what do you want?\" I say I want to rent a cabana and I want to know pricing. Shes like oh you have to call back. I said NO I want to speak to a supervisor. Supervisor gets on the phone and says its $300 for 5 people and you only get the cabana for \"like 2 hrs\". I say ok thanks.  I email their event services and tell them the story. They said yes its open, they tell me its actually $250. I said ok I want to rent it and how long will we have it for? He responds with \"do you want a golf bay or just a cabana?\" I said cabana. Its been 3 days. No response.  I'm literally trying to give this place my money lol Im like hey here is $250+ please take it. TAKE IT. They advertise on their website how amazing their pool is but I guess I wont be able to experience it.",

Decided on grabbing some food and beers, which tasted great BTW. They called us early in about 2 hours so everything was wonderful at this point. Once we started golfing, someone triggered the fire alarm. They said it was a \"False alarm\" and not a problem to keep golfing but we could no longer order drinks. Waitress could not explain what that had to do with simply ordering a draft beer. The alarm went off for the ENTIRE hour we golfed. We asked to speak to management 2x and no one came around. There was no presence to assure guests or compensate for those who are mid game or anything. Awful way to take care of customers but because of their wonderful location of constant tourists, it won't matter. I realize I went on an off night, it was just how management handled (OR NOT HANDLED I should say) the situation that I find most bothersome. Sorry, I'll take my hundreds of dollars and spend them elsewhere.",

    "text": "Let me start off by saying that I LOVE Topgolf!  I was not very impressed by this one in Las Vegas! The food was great and so was our waitress. It does tend to get a little on the pricey side though if your are playing, drinking and eating.   Now the reason I gave it 3 stars...  Some of their heaters were not working in other booths so we had other customers coming to our booth to warm themselves up. That is something that should be resolved.   We ordered two playing cards, received two and was charged for three! Didn't realize it until we got back to the hotel and by then it was worth calling or hassling anyone about it.   When we ordered our drinks, one of them had a bug or two floating around in it! It was absolutely disgusting. All we got was an apology and a replacement of the drink. This place did not go above and beyond to rectify the situation. I expected a discount or at least a comp of the drink that had the bugs in it....but no, nothing. In situations like this I don't expect to ask for anything, I expect for it to be given without asking.   None the less we still had a great time and ended up spending an arm and a leg but truly enjoyed ourselves!   Be careful and check your drinks to make sure there is nothing floating around in it out of the ordinary!",

When we got here, the staff were all kind and helpful, but the people in the bay right next to us were incredibly rude. They screamed at the top of their lungs OBNOXIOUSLY anytime we tried to swing. This went on for the first half hour we were there. We addressed this with our waitress and she brought a manager over promptly. They were kind enough to apologize for the issue and honor a discount on our bill along with waiving our membership fees. We understand that you can't prevent a group of customers from being a-holes and felt that the staff did their best to make best out of a bad situation for us. So a big thank you to our waitress, Imani and the manager, Scott, for helping us out. 5 stars for service, but 4 just for the incredibly long wait times :( if I could give a 4.5 i definitely would!

There was not charge (only tip) for valet, so we chose that option.   The line to check in was about 10 deep, but moved quickly. (Saturday night about 10:30pm). They told us it would be 1-1.5 hr wait for the bottom two floors and a 2+ hr wait for the third floor (which is 21 and older and has a pool).   Our number came up faster than promised, and we were escorted to our bay by a friendly staffer. She explained the different game modes (there are several). Then she recommended some options. Quickly after her training, another girl showed up to take our food & drink order. The food came fast and was top notch.   For three guys, we spent 1.5 hours, got in two games, and enjoyed some great food.   We will be back for sure.   Pros:  The facility is amazing The variety of games will appeal to different types and skill levels of players  Food was good Absolutely professional, helpful, good-looking friendly staff Plenty of of entertainment options while you wait for your turn to golf  Cons: Price was a little high (go with a generous friend) ;-)  Each player must pay a $5 \"membership\" fee to play Lots of stairs (though there is an elevator)",

    "text": "Herein arrives the latest evolution in the golf industry, and an important one to keep the sport relevant and accessible in today's market.  Topgolf's a highly glorified driving range with electric targets that respond to special balls that power a wide variety of games easy to pick up for the most casual person (and each bay has a selection of a driver, about three irons, and a wedge).  Add to it cocktails, pub food, TVs, sports book window, and pop music the way only Vegas can and you have the gist of what the place is about.  For the avid or even mildly experienced golfer, it can feel kinda like golf dumbed down, and the knowledge of the staff here (and from what I've heard at other locations) doesn't seem to match the premium they charge to play here, aside from the fact that they do really try to encourage the patrons to spend on F&B.  Surprised that there's no putting component at their centers.  I pre-purchased a membership prior to arrival, only to find they couldn't bring it up when I was assigned to a bay (they probably should've had a longer soft open period prior to \"official\" launch) so my scores which should be logged to my membership were not.  I also wasn't given a physical card even though their website said I'd be given one upon arrival.  All things that are discouraging if you're going to be paying a premium to play  The place is rather costly (cheapest hourly rate is $30 on Mon-Thurs. before noon, rates are higher later in day and for the upper floor bays) to be one's local regular driving range.  It is a quite novel attraction that is likely to attract casual visitors from out of town looking for a fun way to spend and hour or two  Hope this place improves over time, as it is essentially the company's flagship location.  Novel and fun, but perhaps too costly and trendy to be an avid golfer's regular range.  (P.S. parking onsite is valet only (comped at time of review), self park must use MGM garage and walk pathway past MGM pools to get to center, which may become an annoyance once the MGM parking fees go into effect).",

Had fun but the service was slow, ordered fries and drinks that took forever to come out. There was also some glitches with setting up the memberships and neither my wife or I received our cards that you use to log in. We were charged $10 for the membership and when I asked about our cards I was told don't worry you can get new ones or we can look you up by your phone number. Also you will get an email with your number. I have not received a number and they can't pull my membership up by my phone number. Seems they need to fix the system or hire people that know how to set up a membership properly.",

    "text": "I was so disappointed... being a local, all the hype really made me think this place was going to be a blast.   After 10 min being stuck on koval waiting to get into the parking lot, and 45 min of circling the parking lot looking for a parking spot, I finally made it in where I was told there would be a 2 hour wait. I met my 3 friends at the lounge to discover they had a similar entrance, but we remained optimistic. 3 round of beers, 3 appetizers, and almost $200 later we were told our bay was ready. Unfortunately, they would not transfer our $200 tab downstairs to our bay, so we wasted another 20 mins hunting for our waitress to close us out.   After almost 3.5 hours total of waiting (including parking) we got to start golfing (I GAVE 2 STARS BECAUSE THE GAME ITSELF IS VERY FUN! It's the people that ruined it). We were explained the LONG list of rules with a brief orientation on how the games worked.  We played for 2 hours. About 20 min in an employee walks up to us as tells us we cannot \"Happy Gilmore\" (which we had not been), so we asked him who was doing it so we could \"make fun of them\". He said \"no one did, I'm just reminding you..... wtf, ok? THEN IT HAPPENS AGAIN 30 MIN LATER!!! Before we knew it we were apparently assigned a security guard to stand behind our bay ALL night! He couldn't say anything/do anything to us because we never did anything wrong.   We killed 4 pitchers of beer and a few orders of French fries, pay our $400 addition tab, added a 7% tip since all he did was bring 3 pitchers of beer and harass us. This guy stopped us before we could leave and confronted us about the tip.....   This place is a joke. Great concept. Horrible operation. Maybe I'll check this out again if ever under new management.",

Not all the bays were full so not sure why the long wait. Maybe it was a staffing issue.   Concept: As none of us are golfers, we chose to all hit 20 balls each in 5 ball intervals. This took over an hour and we did 2 hours.   Food: tasty! We ordered the fried shrimp, steak kabobs, marguerita flatbread, tacos, and injectable donuts.   Service: attentive but weird that we had about 5 different waiters taking care of us in a two hour period.   Cost: $60 for golf, $200 for food and beers.   Parking: free parking in their own lot. I screwed up and parked in the MGM self parking and walked forever. Don't do that!  This was fun and a great outing to do with coworkers in a group of 6 as the couch barely fit us all. Would do this again if we ever need some type of group activity.",

Club like vibe with other games besides golf like cornhole. 4. Live music! Inside the bar area. 5. The gamification aspect makes it way more interesting than just swinging around a club.  What I dislike:  1. Really mediocre bar food. I'm a foodie so it's hard to impress me. Did enjoy the lobster roll. 2. Restrooms are hard to find. Like where are the signs?!?! 3. The heat makes the computer system 'jam up'. It could take forever to finish a game. Super annoying! Like get a blast of cool air on that CPU, m-kay?  I hear we are getting a Top Golf in my area (Indianapolis) soon. Perfect for date night!",

    "text": "A very enjoyable twist on the driving range concept.   The various games you can select were fun for all skill levels.    The clubs that are provided are much higher quality than those you can borrow or rent at the typical driving range.     The food was excellent if a bit pricy, but it was higher end than you'd expect at a driving range... way more than the standard hot dog, hot pretzel and burger.    Definitely explore the extensive menu and try some items, you won't be disappointed.     Have your meal here  - No need to stop for lunch dinner on the way.   The coffee was good as well.    Servers were helpful and attentive.    So why not 5 stars?    It is a bit pricy to beat balls here, even at the least expensive times it $30 per hour... that seems about 25 percent higher than it should be even for Vegas....    all in all a fun time for everyone",

When we walked in we were given prices and times. We chose to go with the hour session. We were escorted to our spot and it went down hill from there. My sister was told her card didn't work. Come to find out the guy was swiping it backwards. He rushed the entire time he was working with us. I then asked if we could order some food and knew what we wanted. I was told the kitchen was closed. A few moments later another staff member said he could put in the order. Our food was brought out within seconds. Which was a plus it was only dip. Let me back up as we finish setting the game up we were asked if we wanted to play 30 mins or 1 hour. Mind you 30 mins was not a option at the front desk. Of course I chose the hour I told the lady at the front desk. I explained to him that the front desk personnel said we could do a hour. Fast forward 30 minutes in the screen tells us we have 15 minutes left. Doing the math it doesn't add up to an hour. The entire time the staff stood over us as if they wanted us to hurry up and leave. We asked for more chips for the dip and once again told the kitchen was closed but, someone else brought more chips out. Exactly 10 minutes later the staff comes through saying it's closed and we had to leave. As customers we should of been explained everything at the front desk and told we would not get an hour. I was still charged for a hour ever playing only 40 mins. I couldn't enjoy my tome as I felt we were being rushed the entire time. I wish things could have been different as I love Top Gold atmosphere all the other times we have went.",

Basically, you rent a \"tee area\" with comfortable seating and a table at an hourly rate (in 30 minute increments after the first hour), for up to 6 people, I think. Once your hour starts, you can play a variety of golf games, aiming for the scoring holes. Each hole is divided into different scoring values; closer to the center gets more points most of the time.

We first attempted around 7 and let's just say it wasn't going to happen. I believe they told us it was going to be between 2-3 hours. We decided to come back later that night and much later. I believe we showed up around 11-12 that night and the wait was around 15 minutes. Their technology is really fun and impressive. The golf balls pop out with just the slightest wave of a club and you're off. The lit up course is a sight to see and it's a True joy to see your ball land in one of the pockets. The screens are fun to see and monitor where the ball lands exactly and how many points are rewarded. The back drop of the Vegas strip is also a beauty to see. Topgolf is a joy for everyone of all ages and whether you even enjoy golf. Just go out with your friends and hit a few balls and just have a good time.",

    "text": "I've been here twice and my most recent experience wasn't at all that great...  1. When a golf club from the upper floor comes falling unexpectedly onto your putting space (literally landing 2 feet away from my brother) and a worker replies \"Oh, that happens all the time,\" then I want no part in the lack of safety this business provides. The netting that's supposed to catch the clubs have huge holes in them, giving clubs a large chance of falling through.  2. That wasn't my only concern; we had a hard time figuring out how the score board worked and went through 3 different employees until the last one refreshed the computer and started working properly. This took up 15-20 minutes of our playing time, so we were unable to fully play for the amount of time we paid for. We waited an hour half and paid $60 for 1 hour on a Wednesday evening (plus 3 x $5 new memberships), only to rush our game in 40 minutes. Couldn't really see how \"fun\" this experience was.  3. The lady who brought us to our table signed up 3 of our group members (since the other 3 of us already had memberships) without telling them that it would cost an extra $5 for each card. And each of those cards looked used/scratched. Really? If we paid for a new card, why would you give us an old (looking) one? The cards were also made for the people in our group who were just visiting, so they would have no reason to have a membership since they're from out of state and considering what we experienced.  4. And one last minor issue we had was when they called us up for our table, but when we got to our table it was still messy. We had to wait a while longer until another READY table was available to occupy. This is a minor issue, but if you're trying to be TOPgolf, you should be on TOP of your game. No one wants to wait an hour and then another half hour due to simple miscommunication. That's unprofessional and again, a waste of time.  I hate leaving my reviews with all cons, so here's the pro's I found: The inside vibes are fun fun fun. Good upbeat music, large TVs to watch some sports while you wait, couches/tables to eat some food(prices are in between cheap and expensive) or drink some drinks, clean facility, and fairly large sized putting area/table space for your group of 6. The food is subpar and drinks are also okay.    To be quite honest, top golf would be a nice place to hang out with your group of friends. But for my last visit, I definitely would not be coming back anytime soon if it weren't for all my reasons listed above. However, if I do come back, I hope I can update this review seeing the businesses' full potential.",

Drinks and snacks available for purchase at your bay, girls are nice and helpful. Clubs for male and female players. Deducted 1 star because since it was Only 98 degrees, they would not turn on the mister fans... had to be 100 degrees before they would turn them on... 98 is still hot you know? Inside bar is nice too.. didn't check out the pool on the floor, but heard no one else did either in that weather. Right behind MGM... good experience!",

    "text": "Concept is awesome, basically a bowling alley version of a driving range. Setup and atmosphere are definite bright spots. Prices are tough to swallow - $60/hr after noon for 1st and 2nd levels, $75/hr for levels above 2nd. If you go w/ one other person, you end up probably hitting 50-55 balls each if you're both efficient. That kind of value is egregious. Plus they charge each person $5 for a membership card that is utterly useless. Absolutely zero user benefits w/ a membership card.   We didn't order any food, but drink prices are decent. $28 for a beer pitcher which is respectable for Vegas. Only problem I had w/ that was I ordered a pitcher of Lagunitas and received Blue Moon or Shock Top instead. After questioning the beer, our server tasted it and gave us a sample of the \"Lagunitas,\" which was basically Blue Moon and kept insisting that it was an IPA. Appreciate the attempt at service, but they have problems distinguishing drinks. An IPA is very different from a light Belgian ale and you can even tell by the coloration. Other than that debacle, the Frozen Mule is pretty tasty.   Overall, the environment can be a lot of fun, especially for larger groups like bachelor parties. But as stated before, the value is just atrocious. Ended up paying $70 for an hour after waiting 40 min for a bay.",

    "text": "Would be 5-stars, but it's rather pricey rates (even expensive by golf standards) chop off a star.  I do think they really nail it on the head in terms of what they are trying to accomplish...add some zest and flair to a rather stodgy sport.  Good food, mix it with a kinda bowling alley vibe (but a million times more swanky), and throw in Vegas cocktail waitress and you have a great combination.  Serious golfers, i'd say just leave your clubs at home.  They have (at least in my 3rd floor stall) a very nice set of Callaway XR irons, drivers, fairway woods and hybrids.  Not a full 14 club bag per-se...but all the \"odd\" numbers: 1W, 3W, 3H, 5i, 7i, 9i, and SW...which is more than enough to get by...except for me trying to hit the 90 yard target since that's my Gap wedge distance...which they don't supply.  Back fence is 200 yards out and they only have low tees that you'd use on a 3 Wood (i guess they don't want anyone popping up a driver into the sky and over the fence into Koval Ln).  The chipped balls don't register shots past 200 anyway.  Scoring only occurs when you get a ball in a target...so if it lands on the turf...no stats are provided (bummer).  Service, waitress were attentive and nice.  I was more focused on trying to get the most bang for my golfing buck ($60 per hour at 10am Saturday...imma hit as many balls as i possibly can). Charging this to your MLife hotel room is another plus (yay, tier points!).    Stalls are not as cool as you were led to believe when they say \"climate controlled.\" They have those nice ceiling heaters for winter time...but in the Vegas summer (it was 107 when we went) the only respite you really get is from the sun...but not the heat.  Spray misters would have been good...heck even cheapy driving ranges have those.  You can dodge the heat and go inside to the bar area though.    Overall, a wonderful concept, a great vibe...and a super awesome place to go with a group of golfing friends.",

They comped the one hour we paid for and let us stay and play as long as we wanted. We were there for 4 hours. We just paid for our food and drinks! Our server in our bay was attentive and friendly. The server near the bar on the first level (while we were waiting) sucked but that was just her an no reflection on the place. Everyone we came into contact was helpful and friendly. LOVE this concept, super fun place! We'll be back for sure! Most of the food we had was great and the place was very clean! Btw- the only reason it didn't get 5 stars from me was the tee was too short to use the wood. We asked and they only had one size. Food we tried: Salumi flatbread, excellent. Pulled pork sliders, great. Steak pita, not good - too chewy and dry and flavor was a miss. Tator tots, great. Burger, great. Donut holes, okay but wouldn't get them again - not sweet enough.",

It's amazing how far technology has come so that you're able to track how far you've hit a golf ball when there are thousands of golf balls already in the field. You pay by the space so the more people you have, they cheaper it'll be per person.  The appetizers were also pretty good so if you're not playing, you can always sit back and have a snack.  The only downside about this place is the wait. I feel like there will always be a 2-3 hour wait no matter when you go. Good thing our hotel was across the street so we just waited til they gave us a call.",

This place is packed on Saturday nights! I would have loved to go when it was less busy. It's most expensive to go when we went (which I didn't know as I've only ever gone during the week) $90/hour, but split four ways isn't bad, and you can have up to I think 10 per space.  The drink prices are great compared to other places and the food selection is good too. It's so clean and well taken care of I would recommend this over a lot of places in Vegas, especially since it has food and drinks.  I suck at gold and still enjoy coming here.  It's also worth noting that smoking ins't allowed inside which is a nice change of pace from the rest of Vegas.  Bring a group, show up early, plan to hang for a few hours, and you'll have a blast. They have four levels and some huge screen TVs plus corn hole!  They also have a nice pool inside with glass walls which would be fun to hang at mid-day between golfing and eating.  I'm going back in a few weeks and will visit here again for sure.",

There was an hour wait, but when I was walking around, it looked like there were a lot of open bays so I went to the front to ask and a bay just so happen to open up... :/ The server was helpful and brought our food out on time.   We tried the marguerite flatbread, chicken flatbread, chicken wings, nachos, and tacos. They were all really good! Some of the flatbread was a bit burnt though. And the chicken wings were a bit dry but other than that, it was fairly good!   The games were around the same. The higher bays are always nicer and I guess for the Vegas location, more expensive. And if you want to golf at night, it cost more as well. Everything in Vegas cost more! - and thats not just a saying.",

On a Friday night this place was hopping. We had to wait about 40 minutes for a bay but that was easily passed with watching hockey, dining on chicken wings and drinking beer! The food was actually very good. Although the price was a little on the high-end for pub food. I would recommend the chicken wings. We also tried the crispy rock shrimp which was crispy with an Asian flare. Actually pretty good.   This place is huge. I predict around 100 bays on different floors. Top floors are more expensive. You rent the bay by the hour similar to a bowling alley. We initially decided to bring our own golf clubs but quickly discovered that the mats were best utilized with topgolf provided clubs.   There are multiple different games you can play. In essence the goal is to hit each target in order to gain the most points.  You don't need to know how to play golf to have a good time or do well.  Rumor has it that they are opening a top golf in St Louis. I cannot wait for it to open up!  You will likely find me and my friends there on any given night.",

    "text": "First time at top golf with my family.  We saw that locals get a discount of 20% off, which got us interested.  When I arrived the girl at the front desk said there would be an hour wait. I was ok, but then she said because they were so busy today, they are allowing kids on the 3rd and 4th deck.  I asked what would the cost be, she told me the host will set me up and let me know.  When we got up there, the host got us started.  I didn't realize we were being charged $60 an hour versus the $45, until the bill came.  If this was disclosed when I asked  from the start I would have declined.  So TJ (Teamlead) came over and said he can get the manager. So Chris came over and I told him the same story about not knowing the price difference.  He said the price on the board downstairs are posted accurately. (No kidding, really?) Ok, I get it, but I was told otherwise.  Instead of offering to honor the same price that was listed for me and my kids I was offered an explanation of the price are listed on the board.  Lesson learned and since I learned it well. I would like to let everyone know that customer service is their last priority here.  Btw, if your employees only go by the signs. Then there is an issue here as well, since your signs states 3rd floor are for 21 and over only. Not sure if I will take my kids back any time soon since there are plenty of driving range around town. Although, I can see this as a place I can continue to enjoy with my kids, the negative experience has me thinking twice. Read some of the current reviews and it seems service is going down hill quickly.  Poor service in a service industry city, not a good thing.  Do better Topgolf.",

    "text": "This place employs \"bait and switch\" tactics with a pricing page on their website that's totally misleading. First of all, the hourly rates on the website for golf bays are actually the walk-in rates. If you make a reservation rather than walk in, you pay 18% more if you're a tourist on a week night and 38% more if you're a local ($75/hour vs $46.50). Why??? When you make a reservation at a normal restaurant, do you have to pay 38% more than a person who walks in and wants the same food? When you make a reservation at a normal golf range, do you have to pay 38% more than a person who walks in and hits the same amount of balls? Of course not...   In my opinion, you should encourage people to make reservations rather than discourage them. It would help your kitchen staff be better prepared, enable management to make the right staffing decisions (to reduce labor costs), and provide a better experience for your customers by not having to wait for a golf bay as a walk-in. Instead, you're encouraging locals like me who have kids or time constraints to walk in and endure long wait times or pay 38% more to make a reservation. How do you think that sits with your local customers?  On top of that, when I asked the sales manager over the phone why ONLY the walk-in rates are provided on the website, he casually responded, \"Well, we don't give the normal reservation pricing on the website -- just the discounted walk-in pricing.\" I asked him why there isn't a disclaimer on the pricing page explaining that, and of course he had no answer. ... He then went on to tell me there's also a two-hour minimum to use the range, a $50 per person minimum for food and drink (whether they're using the range or not), and a 7% service fee that's added to your total check. NONE OF THAT is mentioned on the pricing page of the website. All of those fees, of course, are in addition to the sales tax and expected 20% gratuity for the server.   I thought my family and I would hit a few golf balls for an hour, grab some burgers for dinner, and probably spend about $300 MAX for the experience on a cold, winter, weekday night when Top Golf isn't that busy. Boy was I wrong. With all their hidden fees and food/drink minimums, we were forced to spend $640 after the tip was included. And if you go on the weekend or hit balls from the 3rd deck, you're going to pay A LOT more. ...  I'm a local who LOVES golf, but I'm not sure if I'll ever go here again. It's not the high prices that turn me off the most -- it's the False advertising on the website and the \"bait and switch\" pricing tactics. Don't expect to do that to locals and hope they'll come back -- ESPECIALLY with those prices and our knowledge of other ranges in town and other places to eat.  Many locals already avoid the Strip on weeknights because of the $12 parking rates. Charging them $28.50 more PER HOUR (if they want to make a reservation) is not going to help get our business. Many of us have morning jobs and/or families at home and we don't want to walk in on a weeknight and wait 30, 45, 60 minutes or more for a golf bay -- and then be forced to hit balls for two or more hours and drink more than we'd prefer when we have to wake up early for work. It's your business and you can run it how you'd like to, but your policies and misleading website pricing aren't going to sit well with many customers.   In summary, Top Golf has a cool atmosphere, fun games, and decent food, but the high prices, misleading website pricing, and potentially long wait times will leave you with a bad taste in your mouth. I've lived in Vegas 16 years and I definitely won't be recommending it to locals or friends from out of town.",

    "text": "Top Golf Vegas has a fun atmosphere, awesome technology, and tasty food and drinks. Unfortunately, the good ends there. From the moment you walk in, you are scammed.   Upon arrival, it was explained that there was a 7% service charge for our previously booked \"premium reservation\". This was not explained when the premium reservation was made; clever lil scam you got there! They made us sign that we understood that the 7% service charge was not a tip. TWICE. If it was that important, shouldn't it have been mentioned when we booked? I have a feeling this is a common practice.   We ordered a ton of food and drinks to meet the bay minimum, but had to repeatedly ask for enough plates, water, napkins, silverware; we asked three different people before we finally got some plates and napkins for all the food we ordered. The bussers seemed to make a habit of \"clearing\" drinks that were half full... likely to ensure you are ordering another round. This happened to three people in our party and felt like another scam.   Per the website, if you arrive at 4pm its a $60 charge for the bay. After 5pm, it is $75. Our reservation began at  4pm and lasted until 6pm but were were charged the higher $75 rate for BOTH hours we were there. Again, scam.   Finally, and most scammy of all, our waitress came to us after we signed the bill and said \"oh, did the front desk not explain how the tips work here?\" They didn't, but I'm pretty sure we know how tips work. She went on for 5 minutes to explain that $50 of her tip goes to the other staff who serviced the bay (I use the term serviced loosely) and so essentially, our tip to her, specifically, was severly lacking. \"The front desk never explains it\" she bemoaned. We listened to her rant about a process that isn't our problem, but didn't end up changing the tip. We tipped on the food service portion of the bill only, NOT the golf charge (which is included in the final bill with the 7% service charge).   The waitress was so annoyed we didn't revise the tip she neglected to return to our bay to give us a final reciept. Regardless of company policy, it is EXTREMELY inappropriate for anyone to confront or challenge a customer on the tip. Just incredible.   While the golfing was fun, the feeling of being scammed by Top Golf was the opposite of fun. We certainly won't be back.",

While waiting for a bay (1 hour wait on Friday afternoon) we sat at a table & ordered food. The service was a little slow but not terrible. Ordered Greek skewers, rock shrimp, pork sliders, & a burger. Everything was really good. Before we were finished with our food our bay was already ready. You can delay your time if needed or just check in & bring your food with.   The woman that got us all set up to golf was very informative & took her time explaining everything. The service we received from the servers in the bay was also top notch. You pay for golfing at the end so if you're a local be sure to let them know before paying because locals get 20% off walk in pricing.",

Plenty of TVs to catch your games, small gambling area and a pool up top. I think what I enjoy most is that the drink vouchers come out of the machines every so often and they're pretty good here. I enjoy the bloody Mary's here every time. Food is good, and they have a good sized menu to select.  As far as the actual driving range it's tons of fun. For those who are regular golfers, practicing and hitting into actual pods for points sounds fun. For those who aren't, it's fun attempting to hit the ball.  Go in the morning for the best deals, and the middle or lower level. I'd definitely recommend a solid 2 hours if you have a party of 4 or more who want to play consistently.",

They have thought of every detail, and have created a world class entertainment concept and venue.  The technology is amazing. The golf balls are programmed so that they can be tracked back to the bay that they were originally hit from. The computers quickly capture and score where each ball stops. The targets are big, and hitting in the general direction will usually score some points. Setup and game play is pretty straight forward.  The food and drinks were fantastic. Our group shared two sampler platters. One had beef, chicken, and pork on skewers. The other was a sushi platter. Service was outstanding. The staff was prompt and constantly checked on us.  TopGolf locations are popping up all over the country. I'm excited that one is coming soon to Birmingham, Al. I  hope it is as good as the Vegas site.",

There are comfy couches to relax on while waiting for your next turn and a wonderful menu of bar items (food and alcohol). The only thing I really disliked was the waiter we ended up with. He told us a price for a pitcher of alcohol which was shockingly cheap to which I confirmed with him 2 more times. At the end of the night the bill was insane because he actually was not correct in the price and the manager said there had been some issues with that same waiter doing it to other people too. She discounted the price but we still ended up paying a large amount. I would never have gotten it in the first place if I had known the real price but, oh well. Anyway, just buyer beware on the alcohol pitcher pricing! Other than that, we had a blast.",

We went in a group of 7 while on vacation in Las Vegas. You can't book bays in advance in Vegas, but I believe you can in other locations. We were given a 20 minute wait when we arrived, which went by quickly as we ordered drinks at the bar and there were other games available - such as corn hole and table tennis.  The systems unfortunately went down for around 20 mins while we were playing golf, which affected the scores on the computer. So we had to play without the computer for a while. They added on 30 mins extra for us on the house, but it was still frustrating. The drinks were good, with a good selection of draft beers and cocktails. The food was decent, but not as good as we expected based on other reviews- we had the nachos and some other appetizers to share.",

I would have liked more prompt service and more of her checking in on us.   Also, not a super easy walk from the strip. We had to traverse across a weird parking lot.

    "text": "Stopped by Topgolf again on our recent trip to Vegas for the 4th of July holiday. This time we went early since it's only $30/hour before 12pm (M-Th). I think locals get an even better deal so if you know someone that lives local, bring them along too!  Since our kids were with us we had to go on level 2, but was fine since level 3 has more of a pool party / club atmosphere (makes sense I guess since they do have a pool / cabanas on that level). It was pretty hot the day we went so towards the end of our 2-hour session, it got pretty uncomfortable. I see that they have heaters by your sitting area and where you actually take your swings (each bay has their own to control), would be a huge improvement in the summer if they also had air conditioners there as well.  Our kids split the kids portion pizza, which came with a side of their choice. My girlfriend and I split their BBQ pork sliders, which were just ok. I think they could improve their draft list of beers, Lagunitas is the best one they had.   Overall, we still enjoyed our time at Topgolf, provides a good alternative option for an activity to do while in Vegas that's not the pool, clubbing, or roaming the strip. We'll definitely stop by again when we're in town.  P.S. I think it's crazy that they don't have one in Southern California yet (SD / LA area)",

Went with the house marinated steak sticks, pretzel board, backyard wings, buffalo wings. The meat on the pretzel board was amazing, can I get just an order of that?? Fruits were also pretty good. The steak sticks and wings were scrumptious too. I really loved their buffalo wings but a lot of people enjoyed the backyard wings more. Both great though.  Service was good for the most part.",

    "text": "This establishment was recommended by a few co-workers of mine. I never heard of it until they told me about it. I did a little research and what I saw and read about this place made me want to check it out. Was I glad to check this place out ? Heck yeah I was glad , IT WAS GREAT. If you like going to the driving range at any golf course , you gotta try this place out. Even if you never golfed in your life, check it out . All you're going to do is WHACK a golf ball into the range area that has targets. It's just a place to have FUN. ( You don't have to be Tiger Woods to play here ). Relax , Enjoy , and Experience what the place has to offer. This place takes the golf course driving range experience to a whole nother level. The complex itself is awesome, very clean and modern. We arrived right when the place opened at 900a.m. , the price for our hour of play was 32.00 that included all three of us. At first I thought it was 32.00 per person - NOT. The price varies , later in the day it costs more. You have to purchase a one-time 5.00 membership card that is lifetime.  You need this card to operate the monitor at you bay area . Our hour of play cost 47.00 for the three of us. ( Prices as of 4-2-2019 )Not bad for Vegas. The lady at the counter mentioned that this membership card is good at any of their locations. I'll probably only go to this location if in Vegas since there isn't one in the OC. Top Golf is a four level entertainment zone , which includes swimming pools, TV's everywhere, a nice bar , food and drinks. Since my family was there just to hit golf balls we enjoyed a climate - controlled hitting bay and HD scoreboard. The SERVICE at this location during our visit was awesome. I told them this was our first visit and the personnel at this LOCATION IN LAS VEGAS were VERY helpful , explained everything , answered questions and were very friendly. You will first go to the front desk and check-in , after you check-in you'll be escorted to your bay area and the staff member will explain the golf range games and monitor and safety rules. And finally you'll be assigned a server which will get you food and drinks and will close out your final bill. It was a easy process from beginning to end . You can stay there as long as you want. We wanted to see other things in town so we just stayed a hour. OVERALL GREAT experience. Just add another fine entertainment venue  to your bucket list when visiting Las Vegas .",

    "text": "Okay, this place was pretty freakin cool. The family and I have been to Vegas a few times before this recent trip, and have heard all about it. This time, we decided to try it out. Got here on a Friday morning around 11am after we called their customer service number (which told us there'd be no wait time). We wanted to play during the least expensive time 9a-12p. First thing was that when we got there, we were told there'd be a wait time of about an hour. I looked through the place and seen several \"bays\" (tee boxes) that were available, and several employees waiting to escort people to their bays. Then I was told that the price for the bay would be according to the time we cashed out with our server. The prices on Fri-Sun are $45/$60/$75 9a-12p/12p-5p/5p-close. Mon-Thu prices are $15 cheaper.   Since we got this new information, we decided to come back the next day and try again. Which we did, and thanks iHeart Entertainment renting out the entire 2nd and 3rd floors for their staff working the American Country Music awards the next day, our wait time would be 60-90 minutes again. And we were there at 10a. So Sunday it would be, and at 9:30, we get checked in. Typical of Vegas, the wife and I decide to say drink and got a Tropical Sangria, and a pint of Lagunitas. $20 for those two drinks, but on a good note, the kids lemonade and Sprite were free. After playing for an hour (super fun hitting into the targets), we cashed out for $80 (including tip), and headed to the game area to lay cornhole and shuffleboard for another half hour. The kids enjoyed it, and they had lots of fun.   A few things kept this very entertaining place from getting my 5.  #1 the communication between the call center and the venue itself #2 The price of a pint of beer (I get it, it's Vegas) #3 the wait time for a bay even though there were several employees \"standing around\" with several bays open. Reminded me of Walmart in that sense.   Hopefully some the things I talked about will get worked out for the new business.",

The golf was fun; something different to do besides the club scene and the daytime pool clubs. You sit, eat, drink and play all while listening to great music by the DJ. The food was surprisingly delicious! The two steak tacos are highly recommended. We enjoyed taking a dip in the swim up bar after golf. More importantly, the service we had from Jayme was great! They came out with drums and a banner to celebrate my husband's birthday and even gave us a free birthday dessert. It was an amazing time and we can't wait to come back! Thank you Jayme for making our first visit memorable!",

    "text": "Ok. First off, full disclosure, I am normally a bit skeptical when I go to insta-famous places but seriously, this one earns it! I can't even tell you the last time I've had this much fun. So much so that we came to this place twice in the same weekend, once for golf and once for yoga.  Let's start with golf. The place is huge, has multiple floors for golfing plus other fun activities like corn hole and beer pong tables that you can use at your leisure (don't need to pay or reserve). So even if you have to wait for golf, there are more than enough opportunities to get the fun going while you wait which I thought was awesome. Once you finish with your warm up activities and get to golfing, the servers are pretty quick to check on your food/drink orders and keep things coming. The actual golf experience was cool too, they have multiple men's and women's clubs to choose from and you can compete against your friends to see who hits it the farthest, fastest, most accurate, etc. The energy is fun and the music/lights give it a fun, party atmosphere.  Food wise we ordered the sweet crispy shrimp, kalbi short rib tacos, grilled backyard wings and fries. Everything was great, definitely better than expected considering we weren't at a sit down restaurant. I also appreciated that there were more, let's say responsible, options as well like the miso salmon bowl and turkey chopped salad, which I normally would order but it was a YOLO kinda night. Oh yea, we topped it all off with the injectable donut holes #notsorry  Also, for those of you who didn't know, Top Golf hosts a FREE (yes free) yoga class every Sunday morning at 10am. They have instructors from TruFusion guide you through a basic, vinyasa flow class for an hour and they give you coupons for discounted mimosas at the bar if you want to stick around after class and enjoy some bubbly. The class is held on the 4th floor in an indoor/outdoor space that is covered but the front is open to enjoy the fresh air while you exercise. You do need to bring your own yoga mat but this is still a hell of a deal to have free parking and a free class taught by great instructors that you would otherwise have to pay $20+ to experience. I know what I'll be doing next time I'm in town, golfing on Friday night and yoga on Sunday morning again :)",

    "text": "For anyone looking to schedule ahead please take my experience into account before reserving ahead. - There is a 7% reservation fee (on top of the minimum cost of food which for 8 people was about $100 reservation fee) - The walkin hourly price is cheaper (in my case $25/hr cheaper)  In total we paid a $200 premium to reserve on a $700 bill. Now I'm sure there are other people that could care less but I'm not a huge fan of paying that much for a reservation, not extra services, not premium anything, just a reservation.  That being said, save yourself the money by doing the following. Checkin, if there is a wait, head to the pool or cornhole boards using the money you saved on reservations. I dont know if the minimum food and drink applies to walkins but you can probably save that money too.   Highlights - Clubs are Callaway (perfect) but the grips are slippery if you use the drivers or swing hard - Service was awesome and not packed (large capacity) - Pool is legit, bring a suit and change in the locker room (they have lockers) - Gameplay visuals are awesome  Overall it's an awesome facility especially when you want something to DO in Vegas. It just has a bit of a ripoff reservation pricing.",

I ordered their nachos with chicken and it was finger licking good ! It is a bit pricey but you pay for great service and a good time. No negative comments for this location !

The service id usually good until you ask your waitress for drinks and food. Other times we've waited a long time for someone to take our order and the waitresses always say that its because they're short staffed. In spite of all that I still enjoy my time here.  Always come in a large group when you do decide to come golf here because it'll be a lot less expensive. Come here at night when the lights are all on and never golf on the floor level because you won't be able to see where your ball goes. You don't have to be a golfer to come here. While you wait they have a lot of games and lounging couches that you can sit at until it is time for your group to play. Once they call your name you have your own little area with a couch, a table, and a beautiful view. Despite the terrible service with food and drinks, I will continue to come here because it's a lot of fun each and every time.",

You don't have to love golf or even have ever held a club to enjoy yourself.  Top Golf only takes reservations for large parties so plan accordingly. We decided to go at 11:30 on a Sunday morning hoping to beat the crowds and it worked. To our surprise we found out that the pricing increases at noon so we saved money trying to beat the crowds. We also found out that there is a discount for locals.   This is the Vegas location so everything is larger and better. There are two pools, multiple bars, a TV screen that covers a large wall, and games like shuffleboard.  Our host was great. She came by right away to get our drink orders. Then it was on to food and she continued to check in on us. As soon as we would finish food someone would come by to remove the dirty plate. Drinks were refilled quickly too. The service was very friendly and attentive.  The food and drink menu is large and offers something for everyone. All of the food I've had has been good too. On our recent visit we ordered the Deviled Egg Sampler, Sweet Crispy Shrimp, & Jumbo Pretzel Board. The deviled eggs were great, we loved the steak and bacon that topped the eggs. The shrimp was fine, but not exciting enough to order again. The pretzel board was awesome with a little bit of everything. There was cheese, meat, fruit, candied nuts, cheese sauce, and mustard all nested in the giant pretzel. Everything was delicious and it was good for sharing. We needed a sweet ending so we ordered the Injectable Donut Holes. They seemed like the only item that was truly good for sharing. The donuts were delicious and there were plenty of them. The sauces were great, but the injectors were prone to getting stuck and a little messy.",

I just do want to say that the game play on the other hand is a little over priced because we only had 3 people an we barely made it golfing so if we had six we would have  to be forced into an extra half an hour or play just to finish the game. Also the game accurate was a little off as well because it didn't count holes an points . So for the price I paid I feel like i should get some of my money back because the attendant had to reset the machine again .",

The grip on the clubs is terrible; sweaty palms from overuse have turned these inexpensive clubs into a weapon. It would be nice if they provide gloves for players to use.  The clubs are definitely not for full swings. Glad we tried it one time, but we won't be coming back.",

We were coming here this time to check out a comedy show at one Birdie's Bar and it was not a bad joint to host of all things, a comedy show in a driving range.  Besides this, we have been here three times and enjoy the atmosphere, the HEATERS when it is too cold at night and the drinks.  Plenty of space on several floors to hang with your friends.  If you are coming for the golf and walking in, the wait time could be 2 hours or so.  But, who cares?  Just come hungry and thirsty and enjoy the food and drink while you wait. You can watch others, you can watch the big screen, or you can roam around on different levels and take pictures of the view and enjoy.  By the way, you don't have to be \"Great\" at golf, just be great at relaxing and having fun.  This is a fun place.  Great place, great experience and good fun.",

The drinks are amazing as well. We didn't golf, But I would love to come back and experience that. Our waiter was very attentive and made sure we always had a drink.

I am not a golfer at all, but had to come here a few days after fourth of July for a birthday. I was blown away with everything they have to offer, you can literally get lost its such a huge space. Definitely plan on spending at least 4 hours here, if not more to partake in the overall experience. The staff is great with getting you set up in your bay, and guiding you how to hit with the clubs if you need to. Food, drinks were outstanding!!! I haven't been here for a concert yet but do plan on it in the future. Love how tech savvy this whole experience was, seeing everyones names and scores on the screen brings out the competitiveness for sure ;) It's also fun to experience meeting new people in bay's next to you, it's literally like one big party. Our \"bay friends\" to the right of us were also having some fun celebrating as well, can't wait to come back!!!",

Drinks were decent--my friend ordered an old fashioned cocktail that tasted like straight alcohol. Our server was quick to take back the drink and make it right.  The venue also had some side entertainment while we waited such as corn hole, side bar, 100 foot TVs playing sports, etc.  I'm not very good at golf, but it was still fun trying to chip the balls into the marked holes!  Will definitely be back to try golfing again anytime I'm in Vegas! Love this city",

Service was great, prompt and since several people had never played Topgolf before, our hostess walked everyone through setting up an account and programming their names into the computer.  Very helpful.     Our servers were prompt for the most part although keeping waters filled did seem to be a challenge.   One thing I liked very much about this particular Topgolf is the bank of multiple supermassive jumbotrons outside the net at the end of the driving range, so any sporting events etc that are on are going to be easily visible.  Pretty cool.  I ordered what basically amounts to a snack / charcuterie board for the booth and it was both sizable and quite good.  I've had food at Topgolf several times before, so wasn't really surprised, but I think everyone else was a little surprised that such a venue would have good eats.    I do wish that I had booked a multi-hour reservation instead of extending once the first hour was up.  I think it would have cost less money in the long run, but live and learn.     Excellent Topgolf experience!  Vegas Baby!!!",

    "text": "Consistent at being a disappointment and making booking a resevation package an effort in fruatration. EVERY step they managed to make being on site a challenge. Booking: I emailed and then called and emailed again to no response and eventually decided to personally walk in and book the golf bay.    Once NYE arrived i walked up to the counter and theres 4 of them and no one in line because we showed up after it started.  They had NO idea I had a reservation and kept asking for my name. Whats worse is that i received a Christmas card from , DJ, who booked the golf package for me saying they look forward to seeing me which was a nice touch. After standing around they eventually find our resevation and seat us.   The lady takes us to the cabana shows us quickly how it works and walks away. For the amount we paid we thought wrist bands would be waiting for us and we could start the party. Theres definately a lack of communication about what was going on. So we had to track down the cabana host for the first time of many that night. When I stepped away to the bar, as we didnt have a host, someone accosted the rest of my group for a credit card instead of using the card on file or asking me for it. Its so rude to ask other people who i was treating for a credit card.  Terrible! When you're paying over $800 for a golf bay your server should be there upon your arrival. I suppose since she already has been tipped over $125 with the contract shes free to float around and disappear throughout the night. It was such a terrible experience especially when they only give you 3 hours.  We finally found her and ordered food.    Its time to cash out and she's upfront, personal and ready to help. After checkout and the credit card is signed they turn off the heaters and send someone around to shut down your golf game regardless of where youre at in the game.  If youre not paying to extend your play on NYE then too bad, they already have your money. We stepped away at one point to take a picture and they had completely cleaned all of our drinks off the table. Didnt even ask us.   Where were these people at to take your drink order or food order an hour ago? Who knows. They already got paid so it doesnt matter. We go to the bar at 12:01 to get one last drink and they said it ends at midnight although the event goes until 1230.   Will i come back? Heck no! Will i send my guests, family or friends? Heck no. Who wants to pay a lot of money on a special occassion to be treated like a paycheck to their staff. These people are worse than bottle servers! At least bottle servers are there when you need them. At Topgolf they make the whole experience from start to finish frustrating. Soon as youve paid.  GET OUT!",

You don't have to pay until you are done and you have the option of extending your time on the computer screen in the bay.  Men's and women's clubs are provided in the bay.

My friends are a little extra and ordered everything from shrimp, lobster and king crab platters to tacos, wings, fruit, and fried doughnuts! It was almost top notch restaurant quality.  Keep in mind, this place ain't cheap, golf costs $$ we were apart of a private party and all food was included but I can only imagine what the food pricing was with such great flavors. We paid $30 for a 6-pack of beers and most cocktails seemed to be in the $10-$14 range. There are enough TVs to fill every sports fan desires not to mention cornhole and table tennis.",

    "text": "Had a blast here on a recent visit to Las Vegas. Great location behind the MGM so not far off the strip makes it easy to get to. We were there for a conference but wanted to celebrate a birthday so we made reservations for Sunday afternoon. Had a group of about 10 but was no problem. They have 3 levels with so much to do. The place was loud but not too loud and very lively. We have been here during the summer and they have a pool party with DJ (I think on the 3rd level). Games to play all over from corn hole to extra large Ginga, pool tables & more . Food is very creative and great flavors and presentations. There is a full bar and TV's to watch your favorite games. They have 3 huge, 100\"plus TV screens or maybe projector screens to watch the games on the 2nd and 3rd levels. When you golf you have you own servers that take care of everything for you- if you need clubs, food and all that. Great place to come chill have food with friends, play games, watch a game and you don't have to golf to have a blast! Going to try to make it a habit to visit each time I'm in LV cause it's just a great time! Been to one in Scottsdale, Az but this one is much better with the pool area and liveliness! Come on, your in Vegas, this place is a must go.",

The only thing that was said was there is up to 8 players per pod and 6 players can play at a time by a gal named Tara. They charge by the hour,not per person. The prices are inconsistent and the wait time can be a bit long depending on the day. The lounge area allows you to play games in the meantime. Bing bag toss and shuffle board! Once you get in the pods are heated if needed, the directions are explained once you are at your pod. Everything else is game play from there on. The staff have been a bit robot like but respectable.

My husband, daughter and I ordered a huge plate of nachos, edamame, grilled chicken wings and Korean steak skewers.  We got wine and beer. Everything was as good as a restaurant.  The only downside is that you pay by the hour and so when your food arrives, you feel pressure to eat quickly or waste time you are paying for to golf. It's a bit pricy. Sometimes the laser tracking to keep score doesn't work properly but it does most of the time and it's pretty cool.",

We had people in my party who either have never golfed or were not fans of golfing and they also enjoyed it.  First off this place is huge!  Two pools, five bars, restaurants, tons of golf bays, lounge areas, tvs, and places to chill in general.  Too go along with that, this place is gorgeous.  The views are amazing but being in there just feels cool!  There are so many gorgeous women there, both employees and patrons so prepare to be distracted during your swing!  I thought it would be really expensive but once split between the 6 people we had in our bay, it was totally reasonable.    I will say though that if you can, and are organized enough, try to reserve a time.  It is ridiculously crowded and when I showed up (Saturday at 8) there was a minimum 1-2 hour wait depending on which floor you wanted to hit on.  Go for the higher decks if you can, as the view is better!  That being said, for how crowded it was, you didn't feel cramped because of how large this place is.  The drinks are pretty pricey though (regular Strip prices) and although I didn't have any food, it all smelled delicious!",

However, I had a good time trying to aim for the targets and seeing how many points I could score.   If you get here early, you might not have to wait two hours to play. Morning prices are lower than night prices.  The lower levels 1 & 2 are cheaper than the upper level 3, where you have to be 21.  It's nicer on the third level anyway, despite having to pay more.  They have a lounge and bar on the main floor.  You can play with bean bags while you're waiting. Restrooms are on each floor; I love that. Every player must pay a one-time $5 membership fee.   I can't say much about the food or drinks because I didn't have any.  But the servers are nice.  Each bay has heaters; I love that, too!  You do not have to bring any clubs. They have some available, but I didn't care to learn what they're used for or when to use a particular one.  The system is very user friendly.  You can have up to 6 players but 10 people in a bay.    This is next to the MGM hotel, and parking is free. I'd recommend this place if you need something to do in Vegas.  But like everything else, it gets pricey.",

I wouldn't have had as much fun on the first floor, the third floor is 21+. You do get the most for your money by bringing in a big party, things add up real quick. It's very easy to add an hour, which is cool, until you realize that's adding $75+ to your bill. If you go into the MGM, there is a booth and they had out $10 off coupons.",

While visiting Las Vegas, my friend Brian suggested we go to Top Golf because he had heard of it and wanted to try it because he is the golfer.

When you enter, the staff that greets you is very friendly and helpful. The membership fee is only $5 and we signed up for an hour.  Since it was during the afternoon, it cost us $60, but night time will cost $75.   Each bay is set up with couches, tables so that you can enjoy a drink and/or food while hitting balls. The staff will help you if needed to set up the computer screen so that you compete with others in your party.  Each ball is chipped so that when you hit the ball, the screen will show how far you hit it and will tally your score. Lots of fun for the competitive golfers!! We didn't try the food as we had just eaten lunch about an hour earlier so I can't comment yet on that, but I did enjoy myself a lot.  It was a fun way to renew friendly competition among old friends.   To get in the easiest, I would say go during the week and in the afternoon as there were many open bays around us.  I'm guessing if I were a golfer, this rating would be 4 or 5 stars.",

I've been told by my girlfriend that I've been impatient when it comes to waiting for food and drinks at places. I couldn't remember one time where my drink went empty. This place exceeded my expectations of good customer service. We went on a Saturday night that usually has a long wait. Our wait was 2-1/2 to 3 hours which I though  was gonna be terrible. But with the Tv's, couches, heaters, and all the games in the waiting areas that time felt like only 30 minutes. Gotta say this is going to be my new favorite spot in Vegas.",

Let's start with the atmosphere that over looks the Las Vegas strip talk about awesome! The different levels, one for adults, one for families, and one for those looking to have lots and lots of fun!!!  Pools, golf, bars, tvs, and games! How could you not have fun. It's basically an adult playground!!!! Booze and good food are always a mix for a blast right??!!! Ok maybe if your boring it's not! :/   Food is fantastic as well as service! I feel like it is a little high in price and maybe that's one of the reasons it's only received three starts. But in my opinion it's the place to go for some fun!! And I think it's worth the price depending on the company you are with!",

We waited nearly an hour. Once we got in we were encountered with more long lines waiting at each sampling table. Tables were set up in walk ways so you couldn't even get thru. You couldn't tell who was in line and who wasn't. They claimed there were free finger foods but I only saw 1 guy for about 39 seconds with a small tray what looked like spinach quiche. We waited in more lines than we actually got to taste them. Many tables ran out of product...which is unacceptable. Maybe next year they will learn from their mistakes. I will not return I will make a donation to the charity instead.  Shame on you top golf...you're better than this.",

We picked level 2 because it was only an hour wait.  We waited TWO AND A HALF hours. We waited so long, Bob at the bar asked us what we were waiting for so he could find out how much longer the wait would be. We got to play golf for less than 30 minutes because our family from out of town had show tickets at 10:30pm. We arrived at top golf around 6:30pm with plenty of time to spare before the show. We had to rush a few hits of golf so they could experience it, and had to practically run out. They were still late to their show. Bob at the bar tonight 3/28 was my saving grace. He got us drinks, helped me with food, and kept us entertained while we waited. Thank you Bob!   We always mention Top Golf as a place to visit but probably won't be as eager any more. If the wait is going to be longer, please let the guest know so they can make other arrangements or notify them if any spots open up on a different level.   There were plenty of reserved seats on levels 3 and 4. When we asked why the wait was so long they started talking about companies that were staying longer than expected.  If you're going to cater to companie$ that's fine, but don't screw over other paying customers because you didn't time it well.",

The 1st and 2nd floor is for all ages. If you have kids I recommend the 2nd floor, but if you're an adult I recommend the 2nd or 3rd floor. Our waiter was really kind and food was really good. It's perfect for lunch. Our bay had everything we needed. Heat lamps and heated chairs so if we're cold we turned them on and even though it's not really private they made it feel like it's private. There's also tv screens showing the scores you got a tv that can play whatever you want if the Top Golf app! Each bay lets 6 people play but friends that aren't playing can come to the bay and watch. This is also a perfect place for events. There was also different modes for games. I recommend the Top Golf game, it's there signature game. There's even bars, a sports book, a shop, and a pool! While I waited I played shuffleboard with a friend. Plus there's a tram to MGM Grand to Top Golf and back. The parking can also get crowded because it's additional parking to the MGM Grand convention center and Wet Republic.",

I received a reply from someone at TopGolf apologizing for their poor performance during my first visit. After 7 months I decided to give them another shot. I now feel they deserve 5 stars. We arrived and signed up for a 1 hour tee time. There was about an hour and a half wait but we killed time playing the shuffleboard and other free games they have in the dining area. After about the stated wait time they called us and brought us to our golf station. The attendant really took his time to make sure we were  told how the whole thing worked ,TVs, variety of games , scoring , etc. We had food arrive right before they called us to our station and the staff was very helpful in transferring all of it from the table to our station. The golf itself was lots of fun and the whole Fam enjoyed it, both my son and his mom had never hit golf balls before and they loved the experience. The food was very good as well , get the pretzel appetizer, very good Thanks for improving on your operation and I'm glad I decided to return and give you another chance. We will be back",

    "text": "Dear Top Golf,  Get it together. I've been to your glorified range 5 times since you've opened and every time I go I get untrained employees and terrible tasting drinks. The bay's aren't even climate controlled so why I keep coming here (as opposed to my usual Taylormade) is beyond me. For one reason or another I end up here with friends and every time I walk out I always tell myself it wasn't worth it.   This last time was the kicker though. I went in to reserve not one, BUT TWO birthday parties and was very specific about the time at date of the first when I walked up to the counter (Wed 10pm).The guy said for the amount of people I had at the time and date of the party the owners bay would be a 550 FBM plus the hourly 90 per hour. Perfect let's book! I said that's sounds great can I take a quick peak and if it's all good I'll book it now. From the time I walked upstairs to the time I walked back downstairs the second man there proceeds to quote me 1250 FBM!! When the first guy comes back I repeat to both of them what I was told and the first guy then says that I he misspoke about the price it was actually 650 and that I misunderstood him and he was actually just mentioning that the was the lowest they would ever go for that bay, but that price didn't apply to my day and time. Huh? This guy just totally lied to my face, because why? Because this guy was his boss or something? When I called him out and asked him why he would quote someone the 'lowest they would ever go on that bay' when I was VERY clear as to the date and time from the get go he began to get confrontational with me. Mind you I was being very professional the entire time. He pulled the book out he showed me earlier and then begins to tell me that the 650 price was for a REGULAR BAY and points to the number. HUUUUH!! NOW ITS A REGULAR BAY. The funny part was that right after that I pointed to the header on that price on his sheet and it said 'Owners Box'. I want to mention that this whole time the man who I believed was his supervisor was sitting behind him nodding his head and rolling his eyes. What kind of place is this? I was floored. At this point I politely thanked them for their time and told them that my friends and I would have to find another venue.  I would like to mention at this point that the money was not the issue here. If they had quoted me the 1250 from the get go and I didn't feel like I was getting taken because perhaps their sales people are on commission than I would've booked not one, but both parties there. Not to mention my friends and I are exceptional tippers. Top Golf had an excellent reputation coming to Vegas and still many people are interested in coming and spending time here, not to mention many of my friends are avid golfers, so I thought it would be a good venue. But this is getting ridiculous. You are not a nightclub. We have those here. Very good ones. Please stop treating customers like idiots. Standardize your pricing and make it easier to understand so the people don't feel like they're being taken advantage of and train your staff. People pay good money to come here and enjoy themselves they don't need to get taken advantage of in the process. It's a pity because I had really been looking forward to your opening for quite sometime before you came to Vegas, but now I just roll my eyes when someone tells me they want to come here.",

I started as a newbie golfer (as in I've never played anything other than mini golf) and left with a drive of 93 yards and could even hit the targets! Seriously, I was super impressed with my golf skills, and I'd totally come back, though earlier in the day when the prices are lower, or to a location that's not in Las Vegas. We ordered a few food items while we there, and quite a few cocktails, and I'm only knocking of a star because some of the items on the pretzel board were totally funky tasting. The salami was horrible as was whatever was in the plate that looked and tasted like raw bacon. Overall though, a great time was had by all, and the service was great too!

    "text": "Can't give zero stars or I would have.   Called around 2pm on Wednesday September 14. Asked if there were any big groups or events that night that would limit availability. Was told no. Asked if they had been busy earlier in the week. Was told no. Asked if a wait would be expected around 8pm. Was told no, only if it was Friday or Saturday.   Showed up at 8 pm. Was told one hour wait for first level, two hour wait for second level, no access to third level because it was reserved for a big group plus there was a concert that was starting at 8pm.   Not exactly the scenario that been painted for me on the phone, but we agreed to wait for first level after being told we could access food and drinks at bars/restaurants on first or second levels. Tried to access second level bar/restaurant located no more than 30 feet from the person who advised us to go there. Was told we could only enter that area with concert wrist bands. Was told to go to first level bar.  Tried first level bar. Was stopped by security and told that the half of level one with the bar/restaurant was reserved for a group. He said try the second level.  This may be the most poorly managed staff I have ever encountered. Not one person knew what was actually going on at their business that night.   Unable to actually access any food or drink or a human being with a freaking clue, we left, $25 poorer thanks to Lyft rides to and from.  Advice: believe nothing that comes out of the mouth of anyone employed at this establishment. It is a wonder these people have the ability to remember the directions to drive home each night.",

    "text": "I've been to TGLV three times now. I have had a great time each time I went. It's very clean, the environment is fun, and trendy.   You don't even need to like golf to have a good time. Wack some balls around and have a good time with your friends and family!   Each time I went I had a different experience. The last two times have been within 2 weeks of today.   The first time I went with my wife for an employee function. They had 2 bays on floor 2 and basically all you can eat and drink. I am on a diet so wanted to get some basic shrimp cocktail. Was not an option. Had to order a $180 seafood platter with crab legs, tiger prawns and 2 lobster tails. It was good but definitely sucks that someone had to pay $180 in order for me to get some shrimp. Thats a major con in my book. Everyone else enjoyed a sushi platter ($110) and a BBQ platter (also around $100). They said it was very tasty. My wife did mention that she had to ask 4 times for salad during this visit but other than that I've found service to be very good.   Last week I paid for the first time. Walked in on a Saturday about mid afternoon with my wife and parents and they told us 90 minute wait for a 3rd floor bay. We decided to hang out and eat. We went to the beautiful 4th floor, my dad got a couple of beers, wings, and fried shrimp. I'm not sure how much it cost but he did say the wings and fried shrimp were both delicious.   After 90 minutes passed and we still hadn't been called, we went down to the 3rd floor and I ordered chicken skewers and a beef skewer. They were very tasty but I was a little disappointed I had to pay $40 (including $6 tip) for a few skewers of meat.   Finally, after a little over 2 hours wait, we got a nice young guy who showed us to the bay and explained how the computer program works. That was a great part of the experience because it was some nice one on one attention.   The booth was $60 an hour for locals plus $5 each for your first time for a 'membership' (rolls eyes).   Huge tv's, good music throughout, good service. It's expensive but it's fun. I'll definitely be back and I recommend you give it a shot.",

I didn't golf so I can't comment on that experience but I will say if your going in the evening take a nice size group because prices go up to $90/hr and that doesn't include food or drink. The parking lot is small so be prepared to hike from the MGM parking lot. Here's a tip they validate parking so don't forget to ask because they won't tell you. My friend paid and I didn't just because I asked. Also the drinks aren't strong so best value is the 30oz drinks with the free cup. Just because you will pay $10 for like an 8oz. Or just do shots. The food was decent but you're not there for the food so not a big deal.   Overall nice venue and as long as your with the right group you will have a great night!",

It was nice you don't need to be a good golfer to have some fun. The attendant walked us through the process since it was our first time. The addition of competing with the targets is fun and the hour booked time went by fast. I probably could have done two hours. With just two of us we got through three games. I imagine with a larger group two hours would be a must.  With the local discount the golfing itself was pretty affordable but the food and drink prices were steep which was the main reason for me giving it only 3 stars. We will go back but maybe just golf, no food and just one or two beers.",

The difference is this one in Vegas evidently cost 50 million vs. 18 million the others would typically cost.

    "text": "I was fortunate enough to attend a corporate event at Top Golf this weekend, which meant that my food and entertainment were paid for. And although I shelled out quite a bit for alcohol, I left feeling that I got my money's worth--and would have even if I had paid for the rest as well.  We were on the third floor, which is $75 per hour from noon to 5 p.m. (plus a $5 \"membership fee\" per person). Two hours for six of us would have been $180, or $30 per person, which I think is pretty reasonable (although free is better!), and there is locals pricing as well. We also got a bunch of free food, including a delicious fruit platter, chips and guacamole, and a barbecue buffet. I'm sure most people weren't there for the food, but I thought everything was great, especially the chunky guac and homemade chips.  Drinkwise, I had two Tanqueray martinis ($16 each, ugh!), and my husband had two beers ($7 each, another ugh!), with a 23 percent (!) service fee included, so two hours of food, fun, and entertainment was $60 total. (Not sure how much it would have cost for all that food, but I'll bet it would have been close to triple that if we had to pay for it all.)  I haven't played golf in a long time, and some of my co-workers have never even held a club, but we all had a blast aiming for the targets. There's nothing intimidating about it, so even if you are a novice, you should give it a try if you have any interest in the sport.   Overall, I had a great time at Top Golf, although the music was SUPER loud--even at 1 p.m. Guess I'm a little older than their typical guest, but it would have been nice to be able to talk to my co-workers without shouting. Can't beat that view, though, and I would certainly recommend it to anyone who wants a little change of pace from the typical daypool or nightclub scene.",

While we waited, we sat in an awesome open area with tons of sports on. We also got food and drinks pretty quickly while sitting. They also have fun games to play while you wait.   When we did get our spot, we enjoyed 2 hours of golf and more drinks. The staff was friendly and attentive. The golf was a blast and this is a great activity for anyone, including young families!  They also have a bar area to hang while you wait. Overall, great experience and will be back!!!",

(that she rocked) one thing that made me mad when we went there was we ended up spending 200 dollars and rushed us out before we could even finish our food. Right when our time was up a manager came and told us we could eat upstairs on the upper levels or go ahead and exit. I thought it was pretty rude considering the price we payed for the entirety of it.  If you guys have over 100 bays, why can't you let us finish our food for the next 5 minutes?",

    "text": "My wife has spoken very highly of the Top Golf Austin location, so we decided to check out the Vegas one while we were in town. Our group of four arrived around 10 PM on a Wednesday night. First and foremost, this place is EXPENSIVE. The weeknight base rate is $75/hr and that is before you're forced to pay $5 for a silly plastic card for each person that you want to add to the \"game\".   We were placed in the 21+ area as the other areas had 45+ minute waits, even though we had no intention of ordering food or drinks. We immediately were hounded by a waitress looking to take a drink order and we were forced to show ID. If you're going to seat someone in the 21+ area, check ID at the desk beforehand. We stated we didn't want any food or drinks, however she returned every 5-10 minutes to try to get us to order drinks. I realize this person works for tips, but I just want to hit some golf balls and it's not my fault the people at the front desk placed us at this specific area. Go away.   I came in under the impression that we would all be able to hit balls in our own bay individually, but I guess that isn't how that works here. While the group games could be fun, I ultimately just wanted to smack some balls, and I wasn't able to do that. The price you pay for what you get is not a good value unless you fill the bay with a party of six, and even then the hourly rate is still bad.  I may check out Top Golf in another city, but I definitely will not return to this one.",

They have corn hole and other games to play. There's a bar on every level, or you can find a seat and order food and drink as you play games. If you decide to hit some balls, you get a server that you can order food and drinks or even bottle service if you would like. The food and drinks were really good and the service was excellent! Shoutout to our bay server Shauna, who was awesome, she was on top of her game providing excellent customer service! Very friendly and helpful.

It gets super packed on the weekends so there can be a long wait...and it's really pricey(just like most things in vegas)  we ordered the dry rub wings with the vinaigrette drizzle, very flavorful and juicy. We also ordered the nachos which were really good! Lots of toppings, guacamole, sour cream, beans, cheese and jalapenos! Yummy! The coconut shrimp was also really good, very sweet and juicy.

Taylor worked with me and allowed us the option to play for an hour before they arrived. It was a perfect solution. Taylor is a movie star beautiful with leading lady charisma. She will own Top Golf before too long, if that is what she wants to do.  The entire staff is on point and very well trained. The food is great and the views are wonderful. With a group of friends or the wife and kids, Top Golf is a cant miss destination. This trip was perfect thanks to Taylor!",

They have different levels where you can golf. It's a driving range but they have targets and you can score points and play against each other. Each golf unit I guess I would call it comes with couches and tables where you can order food and drinks.   I think the best value is the second floor. It has a great view but you don't have to pay the upgrade fee for the third and fourth floors.  The third floor has a pool but no one really uses it. They also have a TV screen at every station and large gigantic screens at the end of the driving range playing every sports game on ESPN.   The computers are meant to be fast and there should not be a long lag. If there is waive your server down and they will fix it for you plus comp you some time. The best way to play is just have a person hit five balls at a time. That way you don't waste too much time as an hour goes by really fast.   If it's your first time there you have to pay for a 5 dollar membership. It's a one time fee though. I highly recommend top golf as its a fun activity in a fun atmosphere.",

LIKE WHAT. The workers get you into the bay area, ask if want drinks and gave snobbish chuckles because we don't want alcohol. I get it, it's Vegas, but you don't have to always drink to have fun _it_h.  It took forever to figure out the screen because workers don't either know themselves or again because we order a water, orange juice, and ice tea.  All they did was say safety hazards like don't go over the ledge being we are on 3rd floor, like Duh...   Over-all I like golf so the potential of this place is awesome but service sucked and just felt like a scam. Pay $90/Hour, after waiting 2half hours for a opening. Only to get left in this area figuring out how it all works, meanwhile time is going. More like 30min to hit. I can't even imagine the headache if did have alcohol.  Tip I can give is before you get into stall area, watch others and learn about the screen to switch between players and what games can play because seriously it's simple but if you are new to it, it's confusing. We were taking turns 3 balls or so then switch players VS thinking had to hit 20balls then switch.  Haha I don't know-  good luck. . Aloha",

I always order their chicken wings here, the asian sesame one is the best! Food and alcohol are a little pricy but it's pretty much what you would expect in Las Vegas.   For the price of ordering food, beverage, and paying per hour on the 3rd level I would expect better service. Our game time had already started and we were still waiting for a T and left handed clubs. Waiting on our beverage and food was also slow. It took me 3 times to ask for a glass to actually receive one.   Also another time we sat at the tables next to the bar to eat and drink on the second level and service was slow. We waited at least 20min for a waiter to come and take our order. Not sure if anyone was paying attention to people sitting down because there were a bunch of workers just standing around. Our party didn't know if they were the waiters we should approach to order. Either way why should a customer have to wave down a waiter? Especially after just getting to sit down at the table.    I love topgolf but I wish their service was 5 stars because it would make for a much better experience especially at the price we are paying. Management needs to be more organized in training their staff because I feel like they are just standing around not even approaching customers to see if they need anything or have questions. I want to reserve for a party but I hope their service gets better.",

    "text": "It's a good thing San Diego doesn't have a Topgolf because I'd spend every weekend there and spend a ton of money.   There are three tiers that you can hit from. The top tier is the priciest so we opted for the middle tier. We did a 60min sesh and it was a great choice - not too short and not too long. There are 6-7 targets out on the driving range and you can play all sorts of games that require you to hit the targets.   The golf clubs are Callaway XRs so you aren't using some beat up garbage brand. Of course you can bring your own too. They have men's, ladies, and lefty clubs available.   The driving range is roughly 220 yards long, so if you are a crusher (like yours truly) you won't be able to see how your ball would have gone if not for the fence. But of course if you reach the net, you get a solid point score. My only complaint was the system seemed to lag at times, which sort of interrupts you when you're bombing shots at targets.   You have a dedicated waitress that is always nearby to take your order and they offer plenty of drinks and food choices. Pricing isn't too shabby, but it's Vegas so don't expect anything cheap.   I took my wife with me and despite not much of an interest in golf she had a blast swinging the ladies clubs they had and sipping her margarita.   If you're in Vegas and you've never been to a Topgolf, don't hesitate to go. If you're on a bachelor party, it should be a no-brainer. GO.",

    "text": "I have never played golf before even though I've been meaning to learn. This place is a lot of fun though. I enjoy being able to pick different games to play and it's a pretty cool concept. Definitely a positive that it's unlimited balls for the driving range- you just pay for the amount of time per hour. We usually have 3-4 people per bay for an hour and that gives you about 2.5 rounds of play but that also depends how fast you're playing.  Once you check in, they took you over to a bay. At the bay, there's a seating area and a TV, and you can order food and drinks. The food is ok nothing special but suitable for munchies and the drinks are standard. It's a little pricey but it's Vegas and you're on the strip so it's expected. We usually request the 2nd floor because the 1st floor is pretty boring to hit from and the 3rd floor costs more.  As for the whole venue, it's actually really big and spacious with 3 stories. The 2nd floor has a full bar and a lounge area to watch sporting events. It's a fun place to come hang out while you're waiting for your bay.  I would definitely recommend this place to golfers and those that have never played golf too. It's a good time and a chill spot to hang out at.",

    "text": "We have family visiting and a gift card for Top Golf, so thought it would be a great time to go. We called during the day to get a reservation and they told us they would not be able to take a reservation, that it would be first come first serve. No problem. We arrived around 7pm and were told that it would be a 2 hour wait to get into a bay. We hadn't eaten yet, so decided to get on the wait list and go eat. We drive down the road, find a place to eat and bing....15 minutes later....a text that our bay is ready. We have an option to get it in 15 minutes, 30 minutes or 1 hour. We select 30 minutes, abandon our dinner plans and head back. When we arrive, we are told it will be a 1 hour wait. (red face hangry emoji here). We are so pissed at this point that we all need a drink. We got reverse geo-fenced which is a genius marketing move, but makes for a poor guest experience.   Long story short is that it did take an hour. There is just way to much friction to go here. It was so hot inside, so slow, text message game playing, and they don't care because they are making money hand over fist. I hate this place, if we have company that wants to go there in the future, they will be going solo. I'd rather be at Disneyland the first day of summer break than to every go back to Top Golf.",

So delicious.  Short falls: The tacos though, well those missed the mark. My mimosa was pure OJ (no, not that one) and warm. At 6pm they were out of mojitos- yes, out of. Go figure. Angus provided our group with a wonderful experience and atmosphere.  Showed us around and informed us of other times and future 'happenings' at TopGolf.  This town is awash in the many stereotypes, one being all the outdoor golf courses (those have no relief from the sun).  Now LV has TopGolf! The group of us who enjoyed TopGolf are all locals (transplants) and we are in the making of gathering more friends and coming back with a larger group. Only because, Angus had a vast knowledge of the entire venue. Cerrin our waitress was attentive and quite the bubbly personality! Now, let me rate the attire of the staff- please change those shorts. Outdoor cooling misters would've appreciated, if they had some:)   Please make sure and locate Angus when you visit his TopGolf location (just think of the one who wears those velvet outfits from AC/DC)!",

    "text": "Wow. Three weeks open and it's already at a 3 star.   Well, this was my second time visiting-- first being for the YelpElite Evening on Media Night before it opened.  My experience this time was so-so.. it consisted of A LOT OF WAITING.   Valet was set up at the convention center next door due to the MGM using it's lot for a large Miss USA tent. We had to take the shuttle there which was perfectly fine but situation was different on the way back. You can imagine the number of people waiting to leave at 11:30 PM on top of only 2 shuttles running (with one going to get gas for 20 minutes) paired with 100 degree night heat and valet retrieval that took forever. We could've walked faster to the valet.. and I could've parked at MGM self parking and gotten my own car faster.    I do realize that we came (group of 6) on a Friday evening so it would be busy. We were ready to wait and had a plan to get food in the meantime. If you are planning on coming here, try and come on a weekday evening because prices steeply jump during peak times.. $75/hour on levels 1 and 2 while it's $90/hour on level 3. We initially wanted level 3 but were told that if after an hour passed and we didn't get a text then ask if we could be moved to 1 or 2 faster. Well I didn't get a text.. so I switched preference. I still didn't get a text but did get a phone call (because apparently I didn't receive the text) asking if I still wanted the Bay.. YES I wanted the bay!  In the meantime, we went to the bar seating area with leather couches next to the stage and ordered some drinks. We wanted food but apparently no servers go through that area and the bartender couldn't serve us food. This was weird because I saw everyone else eating around us and there were menus on the tables. After a round of drinks from the nice bartender who came around to our table and an hour, a server finally approached.. but right after we ordered we got aforementioned phone call.  Long story short-- the food is super good here. The best parts are the Rock Shrimp and mini sliders.. GET THE DONUTS for dessert! It was so fun to inject.. also it was appropriate for National Donut Day. One order is enough for 6 people to be satisfied. Also recommend getting all three flavors for variety.  Also, for your first time signing into their system to play you have to register each person which takes like a billion minutes per person (and won't properly accept your phone number) ANNNND you have to pay an obligated lifetime membership of $5. If you don't really give a crap about the games and aren't too serious about scores (you can see where your ball goes after you hit on TV and via color code).. then I say register 2-3 people and just rotate turns. It also seemed like my hour started counting down even though I was still entering names and had not started playing yet.  All in all, for several plates of food, an hour and a half of game play, and rounds of drinks it came out to about $50/person. It's not cheap but it's a good time if you've never gone to Top Golf or if you are an avid golfer. Definitely not your run of the mill driving range.  I'm still trying to figure out how the pools fit into all of these things... I still have yet to see someone use it.",

    "text": "From the moment we walked into this establishment this place was a complete disaster. First of all, as soon as my family and I got into line the \"employee's\" were talking, laughing, gossiping- what have you. Until THEY were done talking and taking care of their conversations they let us wait in line until they decided to, \"hi I can help you.\" So, the gentlemen checking us in told us there was an hour wait for level 2, longer wait for level 3 and level 1 was only a 15 minute wait. So of course we took the 15 minute wait. As soon as we got to level 1 we realized we couldn't see the targets so we asked to be put on the waiting list for level 2. BUT we also asked if we can stay at level one for the meantime while we wait for the 2nd level to be available. The woman setting us up, very kind and understanding said that was no problem. However, one of the servers overheard the whole conversation and thus did not want to help us order food or drinks at all. We waited at our bay for 15-20 minutes to get a server to help us. The only reason why she asked if we wanted to order something was because I had the, \"I need help\" look on my face. So, she helps us but says \"you guys are going to another level right?\" \"ok yeah I can get you drinks.\" basically saying she was only going to order our drinks and not food. Why? Because hello! Little miss attitude wanted the entire tip and knew once we went up to level two she wouldn't get it. So she takes more than 10 minutes to get our drinks, and only brings them out because she overheard we were finally going up to level two. she did not want to help us, basically felt forced and we do not in any way appreciate her attitude and her lack of customer service. Now, we're on the second level and the waitress serving us, Harmony was the most attentive, well being, excellent customer service employee there. she was the only person who came to our bay as soon as we sat down. She visited us very often asking if we needed to order anything else, she brought us utensils, water etc. I appreciate Harmony for her wonderful customer service but I do not appreciate how awful every other employee was during our visit. There was even water on the floor on our first bay and we asked for it to be cleaned up because hello!!! Nobody wants to slip and fall while playing golf, and the girl downstairs assured us she'd call someone to clean it up, but no one ever came. Shocker. This business really needs to get it together because yes, I understand it is a fun job and everyone is having a good time but it's a job and they need to be a little bit more professional.",

    "text": "Boy, is golf hard!! This is a great place to hangout with friends or take your family. Its difficult if youre an amateur and embarrassing when you miss 5 times in a row lol. Came here this afternoon on Labor Day. Place is really impressive and worth checking out. Super friendly staff, but the -2 stars is for the fact that a girl at the counter said it was an hour and a half wait. No problem, she gets my number to text us when one will be free. So my family and I wait in their nice lounge area contemplating if we should eat and come back. I noticed there were some empty bays on the floor and other groups were also getting told about the 1 hr+ wait. About to leave to get a quick lunch BUT great thing I talked to a different girl 5 minutes later asking if I can put down my sisters name in case we come back late. She ends up saying that our bay is actually ready. Super confused at this because people could end up leaving shortly after they were just told of such a long wait. They didnt even text me so I dont know what happened there?? Another - is for the fact that prices go up dramatically during weekends, nights, and levels. My suggestion is going with a lot of people to split costs and making each player hit 3 balls in a row so its faster than one person taking their one ball turn at a time. Also definitely stay behind the red line or expect a club to the face. The kids in the bay next to us ended up throwing balls with their hands. Didnt eat, but their menu looked good. Just watch out for the waitlist and in case get 2 different people to put their names down and check your status after a few minutes. Dont think I would come back unless I had friends to host in town or was invited by others.",

They have a pool, good for private parties. Very cool GPS technology with golf balls. Lots of bar, lots of places to sit and mingle, there was even a live band. Love this place.",

Needless to say we were terrible but it was hilarious, haven't laughed that hard in a while.  We tried the pizza, chicken wings and sliders all very good!  It's not your typical bar food and we loved it!  Want to give a shout out to the great service too!  We will be back, great addition to Las Vegas!",

The bar or several bars are awesome. the place has several floors were you can pretty much find something fun and exciting to do on every level. We went here for an after party and it was the best time of our trip.  Total late night fun for adults",

But our waitress was sassy and she said they needed to hold a card the whole time when we play when asked why she said \"because we just need to\" we were on the bottom floor and told it wasn't as fun as the floors above. Fun place to experience once, will not be returning.",

I would Hastily come back to this one, service is super slow, took the bay waitress a while to get take care of our group",
