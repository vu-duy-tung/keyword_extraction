The ambiance may be higher quality than most restaurants in this particular area, but we as the customers should not patron a business that continually disregards its regular customers.  At the time of writing this review, I have dined here a minimum of 14 times, and is more likely to be in the neighborhood of 24 plus times.   I will no longer be dining at this establishment.",

Of course five guys wouldn't have decided to make reservations.  But the hostess was accommodating and seating us in a front corner of the restaurant tightly squeezed between the sushi bar and the glass window wall.  None of us thought about it really until we started getting service and the server had to reach/practically lay across the table to hand out drinks or plates. It annoyed the hell out me being that I was the one at the end of the table.  Next was issue was that my order of sushi had been forgotten about. And when our server came to check on us everyone else was done. She first ask if anyone wanted anything else.  That's when I mentioned that I didn't receive my order.  I had to wait another 10 minutes after that.   I'm not sure if we caught them at a bad time but I do not recommend going here on the whim when they might be busy or without reservation. The food was good but service was crappy.",

We had a business meeting, so a place like this would be a great place to go to, just in case the meeting goes sour,  then you can always talk about the chef.  They will not seat you unless everyone in your party is physically inside the restaurant.  Once we were seated, our drink orders were immediately taken and delivered by Junia.  We waited about 10 minutes before she came around again to take our orders.  Soup came first and then the salad. The service was fast and smooth, so we thought.  We sat at the table for 25 minutes waiting for the chef to prepare our order, but no chef, no order.  Our drinks were refilled a couple times. But still, no chef.  Then,  the hostess sat a couple close to us (same hibachi table).  We had to wait another 15 minutes for the couple to finish their soup, salad and appetizer.  It was on a Thursday night around 6:30 pm when we were seated.  They were not busy at all.   The chef, Ryan, was really good, he did not engage much, unlike the previous chefs I've had , but he was still very good.  Overall, this place is okay.  I'll probably come again, but it won't be my first choice. Just saying",

Our waiter disappeared mid service, sushi was given to us more than half way through our hibachi meal(and usually you're full by then) they claimed it's because our roll was baked which was False, regardless it should not take 45 minutes to bake a roll. Also we got no salads which were included in our meal and they said it was because they were making the dressing...??? no apologies for the mistakes that were made and to top it off we were forced to give the vacant server an 18% tip. We have been to this this restaurant multiple times and tonight was just awful. I wouldn't be writing this review if we got an apology at some point in the night but the manager made it seem like the salad and sushi mistake was our fault. Not good customer service.... probably will not be returning because of this.   On another note whoever our hibachi cook was is great! He's the only one that seemed to care about the mistakes that were made.",

Than he bagged my food. I asked if the food that had been sitting on the back of the bar was mine. He said yes. I asked if it's hot because it had been there the whole time I was waiting. He bagged it without checking it to see if it was hot. So I went to the front and checked my food and it was barely luke warm. So I asked Danielle the host if she could feel it. She said There is a little heat. I asked if she would accept food like that and she said she would have to try it to know. So she took the food back and than she had several conversation with cost while looking my way. The manager come out and said is it ok to reheat the food because she don't want to waist it. I said are you going to microwave it and she said no I will put it in a pan and saute it again. She brought the food out and rushed me out because there was now a lobby full of people she didn't want them to hear.  So customer service sucks!!!!",

Did I mention they \"FORGOT\" to bring our soup and salad!!!! It finished with them again forgetting to ask us for our included ice cream desert. Hey I bitched and got a whopping 10% off...

Its hard to find good Teppanyaki for a decent price but this hit the mark.  If the food quality is what it was during dinner, than I doubt I'd want to pay 30$ or 40$ during dinner time, even if it is a bigger portion.  Maybe the quality is better for dinner, but I'd really hope thats not their train of thought.  The service was great and friendly and there wasn't any wait.

This trip I decided to go back to take advantage of their happy hour, but they told us to wait 5 minutes to be seated despite having empty tables. They explained that everyone had arrived at the same time which is why we couldn't be sat at a table immediately. I was incredibly thirsty so since a quick drink was out of the question I left to find a different place.",

Looked at the menu and couldn't find much entree in there , it was hard for me to figure out the menu and how to order .... There was not much varieties other than 2 pages of drinks, some sushi and hibachi. I was hoping there were more dinner entrees. Just not what I expected. Paid for drinks and left. I would say this restaurant is too fancy for its location. It's best to dine for special occasions.",

Def a place to add a little entertainment to dinner. The food was cooked with too much lemon on the seafood, it overpowered the taste of it. The rice was cooked with garlic butter that was red. it made the rice look really weird, not tempting at all. He said it was to make it taste good and look pretty. There's Nothing pretty about red, bloody looking rice! I knew then It wasmn't going to taste good. I think they may put food coloring in the butter cause it kinda tasted funny with an after tatse. I don't know what ppl are eating or if they've ever had Really Good food. I have been around the globe and have had GOOOOOD food, so my taste buds are serious when it comes to good food. This was not good food, It was decent, but not like all these 4 & 5 star reviews say.",

Once the girl took our drink and food order at once, it took about 10 minutes to get water, and after asking two different servers for my wine, at least another 10 for that.   We were told 30 minutes for our dinner but waited about 45, and got over cooked seafood. The lobster was completely inedible, but since no one came back to check on us, we had to tell the receptionist to get a manager. The \"manager\" came over and said she could take the $4 off for the lobster, because it came with shrimp and the tiniest scallops ever. We just laughed and said thank you for that. Our server never did come back to the table, not even once after we got our food, and it's not that they were even that busy.  I will say there was one, and only one, awesome employee. Props to the busser with the dark hair, half up in a ponytail. He was literally the only one who came to our our table to see how we were. Thank you for the one person with work ethic and a positive attitude. The other busser(blonde)walled right past us when we were standing at the door waiting for someone to greet us.   Horrible service, less than mediocre food, and never returning back. Thanks for a stellar date night with my husband.",

Meanwhile my wife ordered for her and the kids.  When I came back with my food they told me I could not eat outside food in there because it's a health code violation.  When I asked her what violation that was she couldn't answer me.  She then asked me to put my food away.  When I asked her for another plate she told me OK BUT THERE WAS GOING TO BE A SHARE CHARGE if I wanted to eat any of my wife's food.  Wtf.  I said I just wanted a few bites not my own she just nodded her head yes and smiled.    So 2 tepanyaki dinners ($60) and $140 in drinks and sushi later. They still felt it necessary to put the $12 on the bill.  We have been here at least 30 times and we always order the same thing, sushi and 1 dinner that we share and 1 dinner that some of our children share.  We have NEVER once paid a share charge.  I spoke with the manager who had no answers for me and refused to answer any questions, her only explanation for the no outside food and the share charge was \"new management\".   Maybe the new management accounts for the subpar food as well.  We've been coming here for over 10 years and honestly might not be back.  Disappointing.",

Instead I received a raw roll that looked nothing like the picture on the menu. When I asked the waiter I was informed that the roll is raw and that the menu was incorrect. They didn't even offer to fry the roll. However, Jorge was the bomb!!! Very entertaining and the food he prepared was awesome. He is the only reason I'm giving 3 stars.",

I order the bento lunch box that comes with a salad, rice, shrimp and veggie tempura, and steal teriyaki. By far some of the best teriyaki I have ever had. The sushi is great too.",

In August of last year my roommate wanted her birthday dinner here because she said it was her favorite, so we went with a group of us. I don't like the tight fit at the hibachi tables, the fact that not all my food comes out at one time. I want to be able to eat a whole meal while its hot and not piece by piece. I got the steak and it was flavorless. Our dude was cool though. Maybe if I go back we wont do the hibachi, just regular sit down. I'll update it from there if that ever happens.",

Also after we had paid there was a party of 2 people who had their own hibachi table and chef, so really what was the problem with seating our party of 6 at a table with enough space?",

We enjoyed watching him, as he is talented in the kitchen. The waitress's were nice.   The food was ok, but I have had better. I did not like the pink butter??? What was that all about??

My aunt and I shared the sushi so we ate the same thing and were fine, but my son woke up at 7am in the morning (with nothing else eaten between the time we ate at Geisha and the morn) VIOLENTLY vomiting. For the next 14 hours he had severe vomiting, sweats, joints seizing up, diarrhea and lethargy. TOTAL FOOD POISONING!! We almost rushed him to the ER at one point and when I called the restaurant all I got was a \"sorry about that\". Be very, very careful eating here. After this incident I placed a complaint with the state board of health and found out their other location has been on Dirty Dining for yep you guessed it, unsanitary food conditions and improper food handling. Also reading other yelp reviews I see others have gotten sick or experienced roaches and unsanitary conditions. Freakin grose!! Food was decent but seriously after witnessing what my son went through after eating there NEVER again!!",

The food is great and worth going just my husband and I, but the atmosphere and sake bombs makes for a much more eventful night if you're in a larger group.   The filet is phenomenal. Tender and delicious. I love the \"pink\" rice also; just another way Geisha House adds to the experience. The cooks are always a lot of fun and very entertaining. It's not uncommon for the cook to do a sake bomb (or 2) with the group, on us of course! I am not a fan of the soup, but I honestly am just not a fan of the flavor regardless of where it is served. The salad is decent and the vegetables are good. Aside from that, the only reason I give them 4 stars instead of 5 is that they will not seat you until every last member of your group is there. While I understand this is to prevent us from taking up space, if we want to get seated and start with a few sake bombs I don't think we should be denied that. That aside, I highly recommend this place!",

I waited 30 mins for food that never came. Then the restaurant had the audacity to auto charge an 18% gratuity. If I receive good service, I leave a generous tip. If you don't look at your check, you might tip them twice because even if they auto charge you 18% there is another tip line almost tricking you into leaving a tip on top of the 18% gratuity. According to new IRS rules as of January 1st, there is no more automatic gratuity charge. Gratuity is \"gratitude\" for good service. The manager, Ryan, returned our gratuity money after we complained about it. I recommend eating elsewhere.",

They need to get more cooks in there for how many people come in and take some lessons on how to handle raw foods!! They are losing business becuz of it . To top it off we never got my dads surprise cake/ice cream and we left having to go back in with a bad stomach ache and use the restrooms .

I thought I would try this place - it was close.   The place is nice inside - service was efficient - not friendly though.     I order a beer and a spicy tuna handroll to start.  I am used to a cone shaped hand roll, but this was tube shaped and the size of an almond joy???  It was okay not great.  Then I ordered a cut roll.  I was watching him make it and something wasn't right, but i couldn't put my thumb on it.  It was okay - but I wasn't even close to being full or even satisified.  I order another roll off the menu.  Still - wan't quite sure what the prob was.  Again - it was okay.  After a hand roll and 2 cut rolls I was still starving - but geez I am on a budget.  Anyway - I realized they use small pieces of nori and therefor you end up with a smaller sushi roll.  The rolls were substantially smaller  than a typical roll!!!  I am not a glutton by any means but I expect a sushi roll to be a ...---\"sushi roll!\"  I wasn't ordering off the kids menu here.    The bill was $40; 1 hand roll, 2 tiny rolls, 1 beer.  Usually 2 rolls will do the trick for me.  After 3 mini rolls I left unsatisfied and feeling duped.  In this economy people are looking for value - not skimpy mini rolls!  ATTN: Giesha House - Your tiny sushi rolls do not cut it - I will not be back.",

    "text": "I came in with a large family party for me nephew's birthday. Having reservations over a week in advance, we all thought we were safe here as everyone individually had been here before with generally positive reviews.   Maybe it was because it was during the early afternoon, or perhaps someone called in sick that day. Whatever the cause was, the staff was generally confused as to what should be happening with a large party. The restaurant only assigned 1 person from the wait staff to bring in drinks, which was pretty daunting for him as he chose not to write anything down. After about 20 minutes and several mistakes, everyone had finally gotten the drinks that they had ordered. Another 20 minutes went by, and after some complaining, they finally sent the same kid around to ask us what we'd like to eat. Mind you, we were sitting at the grill and not at tables. Our orders were taken and at this point our waiter finally realized we might want round 2 on our drinks since we'd all been sitting for the better part of an hour.   We all sat around talking and waiting, and waiting, and finally another 45 minutes had past. We were all frustrated and very hungry at this point, and the staff had pretty much just deserted us at this point. Finally, a full 90 minutes after we had placed our drink orders, the chef came out. I'm not going to bother mention the chef's name, but he's listed in several other reviews as an awesome chef. Unfortunately, he came out, apologized for having us wait so long and promptly cracked a joke about how it was his first day. Having reviewed the place on yelp beforehand and remembering his picture in several reviews, that didn't go over well. He started setting up, and just after he placed the first bowl of rice down on the grill, he realized they weren't even turned on yet. All this time, and no one bothered to turn on the grills.  We got our fourth round of drinks started while we waited for the grill to heat up, and finally some of our party had seen enough while others simply ran out of time. A few members of our group decided to leave, knowing full well that their orders were already placed. One of them mentioned the situation again to the staff on their way out, but still ended up having to pay even though they didn't get to eat anything. After another 15 minutes or so, the chef determined that the grills were hot enough, (he was working both grills for our dwindling group by himself) and got to verifying what everyone had ordered. He ended the experience by screwing up about half the orders, and though he eventually got everything cooked, pretty much no one was happy.   The one upside that I will give to my experience here, the chef succeeded in cooking on 2 grills for what amounted to 15 people without burning anything that was given to us. Some of it was given to the wrong people, and some ingredients were mixed in the orders, but he managed to pull it off by himself.  Second, in the enormous pass of time we were waiting for them to get their act together, I managed to get in a baked roll order. It was, I'm glad to say pretty dang good. Too bad though, the next time I'm in the mood for Japanese food, I'll save myself 10 miles and just go to Satoya instead to have better food and a better experience.",

So not only did I tip them cash (generous amount) but someone from the restaurant decided to add an extra 30%. My bill was $35.26 for just 2 and someone thought by adding that extra tip wouldn't be an issue. I mean I get it. It's a restaurant and servers need to be compensated for their hard work. But it's just the principal of it. SMH...just disappointing. Beware and be cautious when trying this place out. I mean their sushi is great, love it. But I just can't trust them with my card.",

The soup was flavorful and the main course was very tasty (filet, chicken, shrimp, and scallops).  The salad had too much dressing and the dressing itself wasn't as good as many of the other Japanese restaurants.  The fried rice was tasty but I didn't care for the ton of pink paste (butter and or lard, I guess) that went into it.  It just looks unappetizing when your food is not red but pink.    The staff was friendly and the restaurant was nicely kept.  The price was commensurate with other teppanyaki restaurants and the quality of the food was definitely above average.  If they lost the pink paste, I would be more inclined to try it again.",

It is located in a new strip mall with plenty of parking.   The Food: The food is excellent as always. Our chef was nice and friendly.   Prices: We were there during a holiday weekend so a smaller and more expensive menu was offered. Huh? So you have to pay more for the same exact food you would get normally. Not cool, Mr. Manager!",

We chose to sit at the Hibachi table, where a cook cooks in front of you. This definitely was entertaining as the cook performed many different tricks. This also brings me to the food. It was very satisfying and delicious. I really enjoyed the New York style Steak they had to offer.

Service was very kind (Jessica was a doll!), atmosphere is pleasant, and the food was delicious. We went on NYE so they were running a limited, special menu but it suit us perfectly. Our grill master, Ryan, was extremely kind, engaging, and very considerate of our three-year-old - she had a great time!!! By the time it was over, we were practically rolling out of there we were so full - everything that was put on our plates was absolutely delicious. It's unfortunate some seem to have had a bad experience, but ours was the best and we'll definitely be going back!",

She took my info and said her manager would call me back. Two days later, after hearing nothing, I call back to double check my reservation. Guy on the phone says, \"I've never heard of that policy, consider yourself confirmed.\"  Day of reservation arrived, 7 of my 10 people have arrived. At 7:03 the hostess comes over and says that if my whole party isn't here by 7:15, they're going to cancel our reservation and put us on the waiting list. Rest of party arrives, we get seated, order drinks, and wait 30-40 minutes to receive drinks from the bar! Food was consistent with strip mall Asian food. Nothing to rave about. Very upset with this experience, as I've been there for sushi before and had excellent visits! If you can't get me a drink in less than 30 minutes, don't threaten my reservation because someone is running behind a couple minutes. Also watched the manager slamming things around in anger behind the hostess stand, keep that crap behind closed doors!",

Our miso soup was extremely salty but had a good amount of seaweed and tofu. I couldn't finish my bowl because it was so salty. I suppose they have a \"signature pink fried rice\" that was terrible. No veggies in the rice and whatever their pink ingredients were for the rice didn't go well at all with the rest of the entree. The hibachi grilled veggies were covered in grease enough to pool on the plate covering the rice and meat, completely overcooked and mushy. Both of our chicken portions were overcooked and chewy and did not taste like hibachi at all. Our drinks were never refilled though there were two other occupied tables. We cannot speak to the sushi experience but their hibachi grill leaves much to be desired; we will not be back.",

I went to this place with a group of 8 (which included 3 kids) and it seemed although we made a reservation they clearly had no idea how to handle us. We arrived a few minutes before our scheduled reservation and were placed at a table by ourselves, with no drinks or anything, other than an apology that they were really busy. DUH! It was a Saturday night, and isn't that the reason people make reservations??? The restaurant was packed and it seemed that the staff were quite overwhelmed. We finally were escorted to our table (that we would eat at) about 30 minutes after arriving. One of the men in our group had decided to get us drinks at the bar, which helped ease the frustration. We ordered off the table menu as well as 4 rolls from the sushi bar. The cook was very entertaining, mixing it up with the kids and displaying his skills. The meal was very good, but after the final entree was served, I managed to flag down our waitress to ask about the sushi rolls. It turns out she had forgotten to turn in the order, and we were told it would take another 30 minutes to get to ours if she turned it in at that point. Of course we opted to nix the sushi rolls, but what a disappointment!!!! (I love sushi)   I really wanted this place to wow me, because it's soooo close to my house. I might return again with fewer people, and maybe on a weekday to avoid the long wait time (even with a reservation.)",

The chicken and steak we ordered were good quality and cooked right, and overall I left full and happy, no complaints here.",

I began with a Sashimi Combo: 9 pieces of sashimi, which were all thick, fresh, and excellent.  This was followed by a good Miso Onion Soup and a nice cold salad with a fresh tomato slice and Ginger Dressing.  While grilling assorted vegetables, our grillmaster wound up discarding too many mushrooms into the chute off the grill, but I got plenty of grilled zucchini, sprouts, and mushrooms on my plate anyway since veggie-hating Diane always awards her share to me.    I did not receive a large serving of Filet, but it was medium rare as ordered and seasoned just right.  But unfortunately one of my guests said that her chicken was very tough.  Although I have noticed chipped plates here in the past, this time I was happy to see that all the plates we received were new and unchipped.  Although I come for the food, the show at the grill was also fairly good and entertaining.  4-1/2 stars overall!",

The only thing keeping me from giving 5 stars is a particularly bad hostess they have named Jordan.

The only issue I had was because the person over the phone said the kitchen would be open for service upon our arrival. We arrived at 3:30 PM and was told by the waitress that the kitchen wouldn't open until around 4:30 PM.  We were not looking to have sushi as our only part of our dish and to ask us an hour later if we'd like to order from the dinner menu was slightly off putting.   I think that the issue with the kitchen time should be included in their business hours.",

It's not like this place is a fancy ass restaurant on the strip or anything. It is in a Walmart shopping center next to Roberto's taco shop. We ended up getting 2 rolls. The Mexican Tempura roll and the Kanto Crunch roll priced at $12 each. Now I just need to taste these rolls real quick. BRB......  Okay. So the rolls were pretty big and pretty good. I would come here again just for the sushi. I am satisfied with the amount of food we got for the price. I still will not eat any of the dinner entrees here because there are so many other places I can get delicious tempura udon, katsu, etc.   As for the ambiance, the restaurant has a very nice look. Modern. Although I must mention that the tables have a sticky feeling to them and smell as if they were wiped with a wet rag that has been sitting out for a week underneath the hot desert sun. Kind of a turn off while trying to enjoy a meal.  Waitress was pretty attentive. I mean, she should be since we are the ONLY ones in here. Lol.   4 stars for the good service and good SUSHI. Minus 1 star for the over priced dinner entrees.",

He did some tricks that I have never seen before even though I been to several places like Benihana. He was very friendly and had a great sense of humor.  For the price of the food and the great show, it was a great deal. We would definitely return to this restaurant when we come back to Vegas.",

All three times were an excellent dining experience. The staff is all friendly and attentive and the chefs were all fun and talented. Their concept weighs heavily on entertainment by the chefs so you don't realize that they fill you up on rice and veggies so you won't notice how little meat you get.  It is not to the point where you feel ripped off but I get the concept. For what you actually get food wise the price is probably a little high but you are also paying for the entertainment. Although we did not have any young children with us, there were young children at other tables and they were having a blast. I would recommend highly for an evening with friends.",

We've order two soft shell crab appetizer (portion was small), a spicy crab roll and a spider roll (the sushi rice was dry and the spicy crab roll was tasteless, there's hardly any softshell crab in the spider roll). Along with that we each had a dinner special, my husband order the filet mignon dinner and I had the lobster dinner and they were both disappointing.  They cut up the filet mignon and lobster into small pieces. The filet mignon was fully cooked when my husband asked for rare and the 6 oz. lobster was not fresh it was rubbery. There was no flavor to the dish, that's why they provide you with two dipping sauce and it didn't help to make the dish more tasty. The fried rice and stir fried veggie was super oily. I was disappointed that this place didn't turned out as expected after reading the reviews here on Yelp, because this restuarant is so close to home we would of come back more often if it was good. The wait staff was attentive and the ambiance is nice, only if the food match up to the service. I wouldn't recommend this place to anybody, don't waste your money here you'll feel unsatisfied.",

The girl at the door said they still had another 25 minutes, so I said that's fine do you mined if I leave my order with you and in 25 minutes will you put my order in. She said yes I could do that, and I said i'll be back in about 45 minutes to pick it up and that I would be taking it togo. When I got back they had been open now for about 25 minutes, so I figured it should be ready for me to pick up. When I asked the girl at the door she said it wasn't ready yet, so I said ok and went and sat at the bar. While I was sitting there I noticed that the cook was just starting my order. When I finally get my food and I asked for extra sauce, the guy said he already put some in the bag and was rude about it...but did give me an extra sauce. When I got home there was NO sauce in the bag so it's a good thing I got the one from him. So as far as the service goes, they are not very friendly. The food is a bit pricey, but I have to admit it is very good. I've been to this place twice now and both times the service was bad so although the food is good, I will not be going back to this place.",

Show was good by chef, maybe a little reserved compared to the others working at other tables. Maybe he was new, but still entertaining. Food, words fail, this was OUTSTANDING. We had the special, a little bit of each entree and were blown away. Compared to the really more expensive Benehana, no comparison, Geisha House wins hands down, hands up, sideways....Service was really good. When my wife's drink got to half empty, they were around several times to ask about refills, same with mine. They cleared plates quickly. Maybe too quickly, the dinner felt rushed which is why i took one star away. They brought out the soup and 2 minutes later the salad, then the chef arrived to cook before we finished the salad course. This would have been a 5 star meal if not for the rushed feeling of the dinner. Still 5 stars for the food. I don't know what the \"Playdoh\", red stuff is they cook with, but it adds alot of flavor as does the sauce for the fried rice. We had  the something-something Bomba desert, ice cream with peanut butter and chocolate, this was excellent, highly recommend. We will definitely be back--ALOT.",

Definitely not going to this disgusting, dirty place ever again. Our food was stored on a dirty metal cart, just inches off a grimy floor. Also, we were told upon making our reservation not to be late. We arrived 5 minutes prior to our reservation, just to wait 20 minutes to be seated. Coolers broken ( no cold beverages), horrible customer service from the staff (miserable snowflake millennial that would rather be in her parents basement eating chicken nuggets then doing her damn job), our chef was hung over and sweating all over the grill.

And our waiter was so nice. The reason I'm giving it only 2 stars and not 5 was the fact that after we were almost done with our food a huge black beetle bug crawled all over our table of food. My 5 year old screamed so loud it got the attention of the chef behind the bar and he noticed what was happening so he waved down the manager. When the manager came to our table he offered to move us to another booth while he looked for the beetle and found it under the bench it crawled under. (He had mentioned that pest control was there the day before.) At this point we couldn't even look at our food let alone eat the rest. We asked for our bill and the manager offered 10% off our bill. 10%?! Our bill came out to over $200. I'm not saying I expected it to be free, but to justify our horrible experience of having a creepy crawler run on our table of food for 10% off was a bit shocking. I won't be coming back here again.",

The conversation was decent (I like my family), watching the Hibachi was like a dance (well rehearsed moves), but the overall symphony of parts could have come together better for me.  Let me just start by saying the Hibachi cook was great. He actually did tricks I have never seen before, which was surprising. He was very personable and even cut the steak very thoroughly for my youngest.   I wasn't thrilled about a couple of the things I ate, though. The dressing on my salad, and the freshness of the ingredients in the salad wasn't what I would expect for the price. The dressing was kind of chunky and almost tasted like fish sauce. It wasn't my cup of tea. My New York steak was also extremely fatty. Usually the steaks are trimmed really well when you eat Hibachi and this wasn't. I wasn't the only one in my party with the same complaint either. I also thought the dye in the butter they add to the rice was unnecessary. I know healthy eating isn't the forte of a Japanese steakhouse, but extra dye is pretty unnecessary. It's my pet peeve about Indian restaurants as well. One thing I really did enjoy was the shrimp tempura.  The service here was good as well. Our drinks were topped off and we were well taken care of the whole time. Overall, though, I would rather spend my money at Ohjah for the quality of the food.",

    "text": "A NITE TO REMEMBER! This was our 2nd time eating at Geisha House, my 1st experience was terrible! But I will say this one was much better.  We showed up 12 people deep to celebrated my friends b day, overall we had a great nite. I was a little nervous from my previous experience eating food as it hit my plate but I'd say lesson learned, I was patient with my food tasting this time, waiting for all my food to come and just nibbling it worked out much better.   if your not familiar with Geisha House we sat at the hibachi table where the food is cooked in front of a rounded bar style seating it's really intense.  Our cook Om was very good and Chuck the server did a really great job dealing with me and my outspoken spontaneous wife and friends. As he is repeating orders out loud my wife lets him know not to yell out her order, respectfully he leans in and whispers her order to her directly now that's what I call customer service!  I ordered a combination dinner of filet mignon and chicken that came with hibachi rice and vegetables I also had an order of sake. My patience payed off, once all my food was delivered I enjoyed every bite!  I wanted to give this a 4 star review because of the pricing but I realized the level of customer service and the awesome experience we had they deserve 5. Other than the price of the food we had a great time and I actually will remember this for some time good job GH.",

Not only are their rolls filled with flavor & prepared well but the customer service is like none other. Their awesome conversation is definitely what keeps bringing me & my family back to this spot. If the Head chef, Chris, is serving you be prepared to have your cheeks hurting from laughing so much.  My personal favorites off the menu are the North Decatur, Fat Boy & Kiss of Fire.  Their chicken fried rice from the hibachi makes my mouth water just thinking about it.",

    "text": "Hmmm. I'm not sure how to say this but I have to officially put this restaurant in the category of pure entertainment eats only. \"What does that mean\", you ask! That means when I come here it's not to spend a heap of money for ridiculously flavorful food, but more so to be entertained by the wonderful chefs and enjoy a decent meal.   That said this was my first time at this location and I was celebrating a friends birthday! At first sight I was pleased to be \"greeted\" by a giant pikachu bear! Pretty cool! There was approximately 12 of us and I really give it to the restaurant for having everything ready! The seating area was big enough for at least 20 guest. There was 3 grills attached to the area,  but to my surprise the talented and talkative chef Om only needed 1!   Now the food we ordered the geisha special that included shrimp tempura, salad, a soup, veggies, rice, chicken, shrimp and filet! I subbed shrimp instead of lobster btw!   The tempura and sauce was good! It was very crispy with very sweet sauce! The salad was just ok and I didn't care for the soup it was very plain yet salty. For the proteins they were just that nothing tantalizing my tastebuds. Sort of reminded me of meal prep... plain and to the point. The rice was tad disappointing, it was just a tad undercooked and had that after crunch that not everyone likes, but I guess it beats mushy rice! The veggies were well cooked.  For the food, it was not nasty but it also wasn't delicious. The service stars Chuck and chef Om were great and very accommodating!  That factored in with the entertainment and ambiance 4****",

The recent visits have been uneven, from smaller portions to finding myself reaching for salt because they just aren't seasoning the food like they used to.  Last night, every single piece of seafood was overcooked & rubbery and the flavor was so lacking that even table salt couldn't seem to help.    With the number of Japanese steakhouses around the valley, there are now--unfortunately--better options than here.",

It never bothered me until today as the rest of the dining experience has always been wonderful enough to counter it. I tried multiple times to call today to make a reservation for a party of 3. I repeatedly got a busy message and was unable to ever get through. So, we opted to just give it a shot and arrived for dinner at 6. 2 girls at the desk, neither of whom acknowledged our presence. Finally I asked if they had availability for a party of 3. I was told rather impatiently that they had nothing until \"at least 730\". She was very rude about it and acted as though she was so bothered to even help. The other girl then stated that they had a party of 30 coming in and only 3 chefs so basically they couldn't accommodate anyone over and above that. I sincerely DOUBT that the reservation for 30 was last minute, so poor planning there. I asked if they knew the phone line wasn't working at which she rolled her eyes and said \"yeah, like if we're already on the line it doesn't work\" and shrugged..  really poor way to run a restaurant, excellent way to damage relations with a repeat customer... guess we are going to Sapporo for dinner tonight..",

I have been here and also did takeout and have NEVER been disappointed. Sashimi is very fresh tasting, which is a huge plus as we are fussy about sashimi, it's got a good texture, taste and color. Our waitress was friendly, smiled and everything came perfectly timed, and the wine list was small but good. We are not hibachi people so I can't comment but I will say that you can see it but not have to smell it. Big plus on that!",

    "text": "I went to this restaurant with my family of 11. & The first thing I would like to make clear is that their service was awful. I gave them the benefit of the doubt when we first got there and they wouldn't seat our group, even though we made a reservation, because they assumed that we were going to be using the chef, but we did not. We only wanted to order food from the menu.   After we were seated, at a table for a chef, even though we were not using a chef, they said it was \"convenient for them\" if we sat at this table because our group was so \"large\". It's nice to know that they don't really care about our convenience, rather their own convenience was more important.   When we did order, one guy came around to take our order and about half way through of taking our order a girl interrupted him in the middle of it and took over. Which i believe, lead to all the confusion that is to follow.   I've worked in a restaurant for many years and 9 times out of 10 i will give every server the benefit of the doubt but there was truly nothing that could have excused what happened. They had a total of 4 tables aside from us with a total of at least 3 waiters/waitresses that i could see actually working. My family and i were extremely patient, very well knowing that we are a large group and sometimes its not always the easiest to serve large groups.   Then they served us miso soup that was a little colder than room temperature, but we didn't want to complain so no one ate it.   The waiter and the waitress began to bring out our food, but 5 people got their food and the other six of us had to wait. It wasn't until the 5 people that received their food were just about to finish that 3 other people got their food. 15 minutes later did they realize that they didn't bring out my grandmothers food, the waitress came to the table with the worst excuse that \"they made a mistake but they are cooking it now.\"   So we waited, at least another 15 minutes, and majority of the group was done eating. My grandmother received her food and asked for a box because she no longer wanted to eat her food so that her whole family could wait for to complete her food. The waitress and/or waiter did not even apologize for their awful way of bringing the food out and served us the check with absolutely nothing to say and tacked on the 18% gratuity as if they deserved it due to their \"hard work\".   I cant even say that the food was that great, i would rate that a so-so experience in regards to the food.   I can definitely say they lost us as customers, and it was definitely not just one customer but 11 customers to be exact. Customer service is the top priority at restaurants, and i know this for having worked in a restaurant for 8 years.",

Expect to spend a lot of money, however. The Teppan-Yaki meals here will cost you between $21-39 per person. That adds up when you factor in drinks, tax, and tip.",

We were told to be there several minutes early so we can get seated.  We got there at 6:15.  (we had a party of 8) We did not get our table until 6:45 (not that bad, but why tell us to get there early just to wait a little longer)  Our drink order was taken and then our food order, this is where is went down hill.  There seem to be only 2 maybe 3 chefs. Our soup was missing ingredients, we did not get our appetizers until our food was being cooked which was about 7:30. A food order was skipped for one person in our party and his food wasn't cooked until everyone else had started getting their food. My water was only refilled once.  Our chef wasn't enthusiastic.  The whole experience was bad.  My family does not do nights like this very often and to spend $200 on my family of 4 and to have this experience was a huge let down. Our waitress did give us our 2 orders of eggrolls for free, but the evening was just a bust.",

Another thing worth mentioning is the specialty saketini cocktails - they are HUGE - definitely large enough for 2 people to share. My fiancee and I shared the \"Blue Ninja Saketini\" and it was very good, definitely worth the $18! In my opinion, however, there's nothing incredible that sets this restaurant apart from any other hibachi restaurant. Since it is a bit expensive, I would definitely return for a special occasion dinner, such as a birthday or special date night.",

I ate here at the sushi bar about 3 or 4 years ago and was not impressed at all. I decided at that time that I would just go elsewhere for sushi when I needed my fix.  Tonight, I decided to open up to this place again and try habachi since I was invited to join a party of 9 other folks celebrating a birthday. I was pretty happy to see that the Geisha Special offered everything I needed in one order: shrimp tempura, soup, salad, fried rice, veggies, chicken, filet mignon, lobster and a choice of drink--all for $35. The chef was entertaining and had a great rapport with us rowdy patrons. The atmosphere of the whole place is just so fun and relaxed. It made a huge impact on the dining experience. The table next to us was not as rowdy since half of them were kids. I can see that the chefs here definitely play off of the crowd they're working with. (We were all adults and there was some maturely suggested things going on during the live cooking demonstration, tehe.)  Not only was it very entertaining to watch being cooked, the food tasted excellent as well. They have this pink \"secret sauce\" that they put on everything and tastes phenomenal. I don't think I've had shrimp or lobster more tasty than what they serve here. I tried to con the chef into telling him I needed to know what was in the secret sauce because I may be allergic to an ingredient, but he didn't fall for it since my poker face was much harder to keep after having a few saki bombs.  Overall, great service and an awesome dining experience that I won't soon forget. And to think I had been missing out this whole time before giving this place a second try. I can't wait to gather a group of folks to have dinner here again soon.",

We ordered hibachi, rib-eye and filet mignon. Asked for well done and some pieces turned out medium rare. The hibachi chef wasn't much entertaining, he just made the volcano from onions and the train sound with the same onions. All other time he was silent, just cooking. That's it. My mom is visiting me from another country and it was her first hibachi grill experience - ruined! And it seemed like the waiter and the cook, nobody spoke good english. On everything I said or asked they were waiving \"Yes\" with their heads. Even when I was asking a question like - Where should I put a stroller, so it wouldn't be on their way? - no answer (just waving head) WTH? We also ordered special rolls to go (Hulk and salmon lovers) which were nothing special at all. Very simple. After all when I saw the check, I was shocked, because it didn't worth even half of it. I think I'll never come back. I felt like nobody were waiting for us, like all the waiters were having a chat with each other, and we were just not on the right time. Honestly, I had this feeling like I'm inside the cafe which is still not open and all workers were doing things which they would do without people being there. Well. We were there, and we didn't like it. If the restaurant is not completely full it doesn't mean that we are not people. P.S. The restroom looked dirty also. So, so disappointed...",

We barely finished eating and were finishing our $18.50 drinks when the hostess approached to inform us, and the other party at the same hibatchi grill as us, that we had to leave because she had other reservations and her other tables were broken. Seriously. Terrible food and half finished drinks and we were asked to leave (along with the rest of the table). One star is too many.",

I orderd the sealover which was 40$ for some tough shrimp and few pieces of Lobster tail... and dense over saturated rice/vegetables .  My husband choose to point this out to me once we left, but.. it seems that the chef accidently served a plate that was sitting infront of a child who was not suppose to get Sealovers.. in the end we ended up with less seafood because of this..I am really disatisfied with this place..to top it all off the alcoholic mixed drinks were nothing to rave about.  I had high hopes for this place ..unfortunately we will not be coming back.. let me just add that the only good thing about this place is how attentive the waiters  and waitresses are",

One random day we went around opening of the grill and we got to meet CHEF JEFF.  The food is amazing of course because we keep going back but the this time we had Chef Jeff and it was by far hands down the best experience ever!  He was very social.  He wasnt trying to show off.  He listened to what we liked.  My steak was actually medium and perfect.  He noticed i am obsessed with the pink sauce and the white dipping sauce.  All in all if you go back or go for the first time ask to be sat at Chef Jeff's table...THE BEST!",

I love their hibachi dinner I can't complain about it because it's always on point and never a disappointment. Now the sushi is terrible there! It's really sad because all the other locations have some good sushi at their place. I order some nigiri sushi and they didn't give me rice with it and when I asked they said that's not how they do it there and if I wanted rice with my sushi I had to pay more. Ummm what they hell!  Most of the servers there are young but really nice there and are very attentive the reason why I said service is bad is because of their responses to my request. Another request I asked was I wanted another bowl of their mushroom soup and the server laughs and goes yous gottas to pay extra. I just believe you should speak in a professional manner and do what the customer asks for.",

THE BATHROOM IS A MESSSS! Waitress could care less for her job, way too busy I think she was doing a whole section by herself and it got to a point where we had to call on some random apron wearing guy- who said he couldn't help because he wasn't a waiter, and he called our waitress whooooo called on another waiter to help us.  Toward the end I had to help my self to the empty to-go boxes to put away our food. Then finally a different waiter took our card and disappeared and then we found out he gave it to the hostess to finalize..... and this was our story of how wel never go to a geisha house restaurant.  P.s. sushi was aight not worth our 70$ bill.  Manager retrain your staff. Clean your bathrooms it says a lot about our restaurant. Remind your waiters to clear the dirty dishes for the customers.

I would have given them 5 stars but think they can improve a little on their waiters...FOOD WAS ABSOLUTELY amazing even the kids loved it...we loved all the sushi that we tried. The reason I say waiter can improve is because we were seated but we didnt have enough utensils for the whole table and usually they cover that right after they seat you if it's not enough. Then we ordered food and it came yet still no utensils, we even asked for that...then with food they didnt bring those small sauce plates to mix your ginger etc in neither did they bring any extra small plates. It took a minute for the girl serving to get us all this before we could even start eating..all in all good place to eat..",

    "text": "Who wants to be entertained by a good lookin Chef Jeff??  Me, me, me!!!  Took some friends out the other night for some hibachi table cooking and so glad we did.  We did make a reservation a couple hours ahead of time and we barely made it in.  So I definitely recommend a reservation for the cooking tables.  The rest of the place didn't look too busy.  We were seated immediately and a girl came to take our drink order.  We didn't wait too long before Chef Jeff came to our table.  At first I thought he was going to be all stuffy-good looks and all but he warmed up to us real quick.  Now I've been to many of these cooking table thingies and I just wish....wish wish wish that someone would come up with something original.  To me its so redundant....sorry to say.  The potential is GIGANTIC here.  Mark my words....someone out there will come up with some new and improved fun new tactics that will be the new upcoming trend.  The standard ole sliced onion with the fire in the hole is a bit played out.    So why do I come?  It's still fun but the food is amazing.  We've even ordered it once without the whole show.  Its just that good.    So your dinner comes with soup, salad, fried rice (some places charge extra) and your meat choices.  They usually serve it all up with a few different sauces on the side.  I think Chef Jeff forgot about the sauces because we already had our food when we asked.  Better late than never I guess.  I have always had super great experiences here.  One of my most favorite ones was when I was hosting my girlfriend's bday party-party of 14 when Osaka DROPPED the ball big time on my reservation.  While I was in their lobby I called Geisha....they said absolutely come in and they would make up for Osaka's stupidity!  Boy did they ever.  I think they all wanted to prove a point that they were much better than Osaka because the service and ALL of the staff was absolutely OUTSTANDING to say the least.  Quite the party recovery.  We ended the night taking a pic with all of us and most of the staff.  For this I will always be loyal!  Until next time.....which will be soon....",

    "text": "The seating arrangement is what really ruins this restaurant.  Unlike most Japanese style grills the grills are arranged in a long curve instead of a horseshoe.  The end result was that out of a group of 8 who sat together, it was impossible to talk to someone more than 3 seats away due to the noise.  The chef's banter was also lost on most of the people sitting at the edge of the group, as the grill is centered.  The seating is good for a very large work group if you only want to talk to the people on your immediate sides.  For a more friendly environment, it is awful.    The food was acceptable, about on par for the price and type of cuisine.   The food is cooked in an order, so you may find yourself finished with the rice and vegetable before the chef gets to the seafood dishes.  The \"signature pink sauce\" was nothing special, just well done fried rice.    I had  a rare NY strip steak and shrimp.  The steak was a small portion for the price, but an excellent cut of beef.  The shrimp were perfectly cooked and delicious.    For drinks, the \"Ninja\" drink special is a gigantic blue goblet of a mixed drink, that easily serves 2.  It tasted mostly of vanilla rum, overpowering anything else that was in the drink.  The ginger mojito was much better, basically a standard mojito with a piece of candied ginger.    Service was below expectations.  The chef himself was excellent, working well with our large group.  There was a smaller group of 3 who had been added onto our table, and they recieved very little attenttion at the far end.  Drink service was poor, with the server taking a long time to deliver initial drinks, and only coming by once to ask for additional drink orders.",

This place is perfect for any celebration or even business meals. They have grill that has seats around it and then the chef comes up and cooks in front of you. Our chef provided plenty of neat tricks and was friendly with everyone. He did everyone in our party food just how they liked it.  I ordered the geisha special which came with an appetizer (I chose shrimp tempura), drink(I had soda), soup and salad, hibachi shrimp, mushrooms, onions, zucchini, bean sprouts, fried rice, and filet mignon, chicken, and lobster. Everything was good. They even give you a plate with 3 sauces and recommend what sauce goes with what. I tried the sauces on different things but found what they recommend is right haha. One sauce was sweet, one was spicy, and the other was more salty. The filet mignon was sooo tender and the lobster was juicy. Chicken was cooked through which is what you want with chicken.  I give geisha house 4 stars and I plan on returning to try their sushi and other things on the menu.",

    "text": "I've always wanted to try a Japanese steakhouse and here I am heading over with my coworkers to celebrate a birthday (not mine!). I was impressed with the exterior and interior. Our seating area was along the back wall. Nice view of the entire restaurant.   I could feel the heat coming off the grill. It gave me the chills with anticipation of what was to come. We were first given a cup of soup with tofu. I've never had tofu and it tasted just like I thought healthy food would taste. Soup was steamy hot but lacked flavor. Very watery (yes I know it's soup) with only a few cubes of tofu. Next was the salad.   I'm a carnivore and I don't particularly like stepping down the food chain to join the ranks of rabbits but man this salad was delicious! The only downside was the size. It was small. I'd say cup your hand and that's the appropriate size! It would have been nice to have a little more. Up next was the show.   The show was entertaining and found myself smiling the whole time. Sometimes I was giggling like a little girl (which made me feel unmanly lol). First was the fried rice that was good and not over cooked. The portion was ridiculous large. I'm like how am I going to eat all of that? Out of four of us only one was able to finish the plate. They cook the food in sections. First the rice then the vegetables and finally a carnivores time of the the ribeye steak!  I don't like eating my food in sections as you are forced to eat it as it's prepared or wait tell the end and it it cold (warm?). The steak was soft, moist and delicious!   I enjoyed the whole experience and I think my family would love to come and enjoy the performance and food. It's a bit pricey but I can see why it's that much. I would definitely recommend come and giving it a try. My tip for this establishment would be to plan on going home to drop off the left overs!!!",

Even though it was a holiday we were given the lunch special menu as well. We obliged the specials. We ordered the From New York with fried rice, and The Special Roll. Nothing disappointed, and the portions were generous. This surprised me.   The staff was very attentive during our experience, constantly clearing the table, making sure our beverages were full.Interior is typical of that a steak house. Plenty of seating. Everything was very clean.   Would def recommend   Location is 215/ Decatur- ample parking",

I have been there twice now, and the first time it was just mediocre Asian food, but the second time was so much better!   The hibachi chef we had was named Ryan, and he was totally awesome! He was able to give us our own unique experience that was different from the other chefs and tables around us. If you like spicy foods, Ryan has an awesome spicy sauce that will make your tastebuds incredibly happy!   The pricing is a little high, but like I mentioned, you will get huge portions! I usually get the Geisha Special with the shrimp tempura appetizer. It's enough food that I even have lunch for the following day.   The only reason why I give them four stars out of five is because of my first experience, as well as the fact that it's kinda a bit dirty. I understand the restaurant is super busy, but it should still be kept clean. The table was super sticky and my hair got stuck in it. The bathrooms are also not exactly nice looking either.",

Weird that a white dude can hook it up but he's expert and his creativity flows- his sushi is so good I only order one roll and I just tell him what I like and he puts it together- you will taste the difference of the quality of seafood used here in comparison to the AYCE spots people flock too-",

This is a Japanese steakhouse so they have sushi and sashimi as well as teppanyaki style cooking available. My favorite cocktail is the kiwilicious! Highly suggest trying it. I don't know his name but the bartender has been there for nearly 10 years as well and he's always friendly and quick with service.  The pricing is amazing for what you get here. I always get the Geisha Special, which includes a soup, ginger salad, veggies, steak, lobster, chicken, pink fried rice, shrimp, and a small bottle of warm sake. It is all $40! The chefs are always in a good mood and interactive with the table. The restaurant itself isn't huge, but it is decently sized. Typically dinner takes about 1 hour. I would suggest reservations, however, because  they do have a tendency to get quite busy for dinner.   They also serve lunch, which is a bit less expensive but still tastes amazing. I love love love Geisha House!",

Not that I've tasted diesel fuel, but it's what I imagine it tastes like. So if you come here make Sure you order everything without the eel sauce. It was so bad I thought it was rotten. I asked the server about it and she said that they hadn't had any complaints and that eel sauce should be bitter. All the other eel sauce I've ordered is on the sweet side. I couldn't finish the roll. I had to send it back.   The server was super nice and sent the manager over. She comped that roll and we ordered something else.   There is never a wait for sushi but there is usually a wait for the tepanyaki grill. So make a reservation for that if that's what you're in to.",

My children aren't little anymore, so the tossing of knives and sparks of fire aren't as thrilling as they once were, but I think the nostalgia of all of it evokes many happy memories.    This visit was to celebrate my father's 71st birthday and Father's Day.  We were not disappointed.  The food is always fabulous and plentiful.  We never fail to have leftovers to take home.  My filet was cooked perfectly, and I'm very picky about my meat.  It was like butter melting in my mouth. Our cook, Ryan, was outstanding trying to get smiles and laughs out of my teenagers.    My father is in a wheelchair and they were very accommodating to his needs.  Handicap parking was easily available and convenient to the restaurant.  Regular parking was very abundant, as they are in the same center as a Walmart.",

It it usually packed on the weekends therefore I suggest going on the weekday..  I have never encounter a bad night here, the staff can be a little more welcoming or happier/talkative. I'm not sure why this is but they all have great manners etc.   I always get the steak filet or rib eye which is full of flavor! You always get salad,soup, or rice, stir fry,shrimp and and entree choice of meat! How could you go wrong! I'd like to say your paying for the entertainment as well...  Long story short! Enjoy your time here, it's a great place to experience.",

It's not a huge place, but they also have a few hibachi grills so it can get kind of crowded on the weekends, otherwise, we haven't really had a problem getting in. There's a HUGE variety of rolls- they also have a few cucumber rolls without the rice (which some places might only have one kind of cucumber roll, if that). My parents love their lunch bento boxes, and the deals for the amount of food they give in the bento boxes are better than a lot of other places we have experienced.",

The management makes sure you are taken care of the entire evening, and most importantly they show repeat customers loyalty by providing a complimentary drink, small sushi, or dessert occasionally. Another great aspect of the Geisha House is how your chef makes the customers night entertaining with jokes, and food play. Every child I've seen at the restaurant is laughing, smiling, and their eyes are fixated on the cooking! Overall, this is best Japanese Hibachi restaurant in Las Vegas. Highly recommend, you will not be disappointed! Also, the speciality drinks at the bar are over the top!",

About 10 minutes later she came back and asked us again if we had a reservation. For the 2nd time we said no. She walked away and spoke with someone which we found odd, but kept looking at the menu. She proceeded to come back to let us know that they couldn't serve us because we didn't have a reservation!!! Not kidding. They sat us down, took our drink orders, handed us menus...and told us to leave after 15 minutes. Still in shock and I have NEVER had this happen! No apologies or anything.",

We sat at the hibachi grill and, although the woman took our food order extremely fast, we had to wait for an additional six people to fill up the remaining seats (about 30 minutes) before they began cooking any of the food. I guess this is normal in Vegas, as I've seen other restaurants do the same, but it was a bit bizarre to me. The food they grill on the hibachi (fried rice, veggies, and meat) is all cooked with (at least what the chef said) watermelon ice cream, rather than garlic butter. It was interesting, but not exactly appetizing in my opinion. The steak was good and the sushi was decent but I've had much better for less dough. Overall it just wasn't what I was expecting. I'm sure others may come here and find it enjoyable and delicious, but unfortunately I'll be looking elsewhere.",

This place is located in a strip mall and we decided to stop in one night after driving by a few times. The food was excellent. I had the steak it was cooked perfectly. The sashimi was fresh, and I had the spicy salmon roll, that too was excellent. The service was ok. The second time I went was with a large group for a birthday celebration, we sat at the grill. Our cook was very engaging and hilarious. The service this time was excellent. The food again was awesome, We had the sampler with steak, shrimp, and lobster. I recommend sharing its 10.00 and you get your own soup and salad and if I remember correctly it also includes another appetizer. Because we were there for a birthday our cook bought the birthday girl a saki bomb, the staff had everyone chant and then shoot! It was a very fun experience. Will definitely be my regular spot.",

    "text": "This place is a well kept secret for sushi!!  We are regulars here and Justin Oh has become our favorite sushi chef here in Vegas without a doubt.  I think Justin's rolls are the best!  When you go there, ask for Justin to serve you at the sushi bar, tell him Joe sent you, sit back and enjoy!!  The Hawaiian roll, aka \"Oh Roll\" is a must order, extremely tasty!!  Justin is an artist when it comes to his presentation of everything he puts in front of you!!  If I could give six stars for only extremely elite places I like a lot, this is the only place I would give it too!!  Yes, they do celebrate Birthdays in a very loud and fun way, which I personally enjoy.  I think anything a restaurant can do to differentiate itself from the boring typical b-day celebration is great!!  We have taken a few friends and family to celebrate birthdays there and everyone loved it!!  Six Stars Justin!!  Well done!  A \"Diamond\" in the Northwest desert rough.......  this review was just for the sushi bar, and since Justin went back to Korea all bets are off...just an fyi",

    "text": "Came way out to this part of town for an event, otherwise we probably never would have made our way here.   I would have given them a much higher rating, but several aspects of the meal combined resulted in a mediocre and anger-inducing experience.  The first thing we noticed upon our arrival was the obnoxious birthday singing accompanied by horns, whistles and a loud speaker. Understandable, as most places do this kind of thing, but it happened at least 4 times during our time there. There was a guy running around doing shots with people and singing songs, blowing his whistle and joking around.   Once we were seated, we waited a while before Eric came and took our drink orders, explaining the different types of sake flavors to us and being overall boisterous. Fine, you're super-genki-man, we get it.  I can even be cool with that, but the problem arose when he explained the \"Mother's Day Special\" to us and conned us all into getting it. Yes, conned. We were told that for our $80 meal we'd get an appetizer, 2 wine glasses of flavored sake, soup, salad, fried rice, veggies and a portion of teppanyanki-cooked lobster & filet mignon PLUS a $20 gift card. Which made it seem totally worth the price- after all, the meals themselves cost about $20-30 a piece normally and that'd be 2 for one! BUT, when we paid our bill, the gift card turned out to be good ONLY for the location we were at. If this restaurant was in our neighborhood, that'd be cool- but this location is out in the boondocks of north town and we're coming out from East-central. And not only that, but the gift card is only good for their sushi, which from the reviews I'm less than enthusiastic about traveling back the 20 miles to try. We felt totally misled by the deal. If we had known, we would have opted for another, cheaper meal option.  The food itself... the soup was good- I was expecting a miso soup but it turned out to be a flavorful clear soup with fried onions and button mushrooms. I liked it but the mushrooms seemed out of place. The salad itself was simple salad mix with a piece of cucumber and tomato topped with a miso vinegarette- tasty, but nothing particularly revolutionary. The appetizer we chose was shrimp tempura- 2 pieces of shrimp and 1 piece of sweet potato and 1 piece of zucchini. I'm guessing we got the shrimp and veggie, then? Crunchy with a yummy sauce, but kind of misleading and I wouldn't have been happy to pay the $8 for it. After that the chef came out, he had a great tableside manner and entertained our group. He and the super-attentive waitresses were what got the star for the place. He started by juggling some eggs and quick frying them. After that, the rice and the ubiquotus special sauce came out. TONS of fried rice, coated in a weird pink butter/shortening \"special sauce\"- I'm guessing something with MSG and other seasonings because it made me feel unpleasant after. The shrimp, lobster and steak were all coated in it, too, as others have said. The portions were much smaller- 3 shrimp, half a lobster tail and roughly 3-4 ounces of filet mignon per person. Two of our companions asked to have extra steak instead of the lobster but got the same portion as us without the lobster. The lobster itself was overcooked and one of our companions thought it tasted like eggs.   When we got our bill, the sake we had ordered was actually 2 dollars more than what was listed on the menu. Not a huge amount- but in this economy it's worth noting. With the $80 meal, 1 small bottle of sake [9.50 instead of 7.50], 1 Orion beer [$8] & 1 Sapporo [$7.50] our bill came out to over $110. Which I wouldn't have minded paying if I hadn't felt misled about the card, the quality of the food was better, and we didn't have SUPER loud music being blasted every 15-20 minutes with super-genki-man running around with a bullhorn and whistle.. It felt like I was paying for the show and not the food, and the environment just wasn't enjoyable for my boyfriend and I. Maybe it's better during the week or lunch, but it was a lot of flash for hardly any quality.",

    "text": "Ok so I first discovered geisha house about ten years ago when my family had our usual birthday dinner, this one for my sister. We went to the location on desert inn, which is the original geisha. Our experience there was so wonderful, the food was full of flavor, portions were perfect, service was fun and efficient, and the price was right on for all the greatness you were receiving. So, when they opened a new location on our side of town, the northwest we were salivating with anticipation. We were visiting frequently, so much in fact that we knew the cooks by name and they knew our family. Now, here's my problem with the geisha house of NOW. We normally order the geisha special for my husband and I, which consists of a drink, soup, salad, a side (egg rolls, tempura) veggies, rice, chicken, filet mignon, and half lobster tail for 35.95. Not a bad deal, that's a lot of food! If your going to share, it's an additional ten dollars, no big deal. But here's my problem.....the portions have shrunk significantly! If your lucky you might get two small pieces of cut up lobster tail, five pieces of filet mignon and a few pieces of chicken, the majority of your plate is rice and veggies. So for 45.95 your paying for sides mostly. This is not how I remember geisha being all those years before. You would literally leave feeling full, and have some left overs for lunch the next day. Kids portions are no different, and your paying upwards of 15.00 to 17.00 depending on the type of meat they choose, this does not include a drink, so your adding an additional 2.50 for a soft drink. By the end of the night your looking at about 100-115 dollar bill without tip. Now, I love food..... I love good food and I will pay for a great meal without complaint, but I have been utterly disappointed with how much it seems they are cutting corners and shorting the customers portions for the price. I gave it 3 stars because its clean, and the service is friendly. Depending on who's cooking for you, the food can be great, and they put on a good show. As far as service goes I've only had one awful experience there and it was for lunch, so I dinged them for that as well.",

We almost turned around at the door when we saw $22 for Shimp dinner and $24 for a Steak Dinner. The dinners were the same price whether you had the cook do it in front of you or not.   And what is this Red Special Sauce???? Watermelon Sauce, as the first reviewer stated? Don't know what it is and could not taste anything. It was just weird to see red rice. It was almost waxy. Soup warm just warm not hot at all. All the food seemed like is was drenched in oil.   Not great entertainment either.   Service. I sat with soup, and salad bowls on a sushi plate empty waiting to be picked up while i was being served rice from the cook.   Good Luck if you go here.",

I often bring my 4 yr old boy, and he gets super excited and is entertained throughout the meal. The chefs go out of their way for him. We have searched high and low for a good hibachi restaurant in the Vegas Valley. Geisha House has exceeded our expectations. The fried rice and veggies are awesome. As a side note, if your not willing to spend $30-$40 on dinner, stop in for lunch. It's a modified hibachi & the portions are still large enough to request a doggy bag. The only difference is that the lunch menu does not include a salad, and the veggies are not fresh cut. They are a medley of sorts. A family of 3 for lunch usually runs us about $35, which is the average cost of 1 adult dinner. This is a must for hibachi lovers!! The only reason I am not giving them a 5 star is they often blare R&B music, and last time we ate lunch there we asked for them to turn it down. Which they did, and as our lunch date went along, the music slowly crept back up to almost an unbearable level.",

Let me start off by saying the food was fabulous, our waiter was extremely kind and helpful, and hibachi chef Luis was so much fun. We were having a spectacular time... and then last call came around. When our waiter informed us of last call I ordered a cocktail and my husband requested a beer. My husband got his beer, but I never got my cocktail because of some type of drama with the bartender. I was informed the bartender refused to make my drink and had decided he was done for the night. Strange, but I accepted this and took a glass of water instead. Then, for at least another 20 mintues, my husband and I, along with the rest of the guests at our hibachi table, was treated to a rather unpleasant show where the bartender argued with the manager and other staff. For the sake of keeping this review family friendly, I won't repeat the things coming from the bartender's mouth. But needless to say, it just about completely ruined our anniversary dinner. The bartender's temper tantrum continued until we finally just couldn't stand to hear it anymore and my husband asked for it to stop. The manager apologized profusely and discounted our bill, but the bartender's escapades had already dampened our night. I'll most likely be back just because the food and rest of the staff were excellent, but I won't sit next to the bar again and listen to another tantrum.",

    "text": "Some buddies and I decided to check out the Geisha House primarily because they had an offer on Groupon that offered a decent discount to check out their \"Naked Sushi\" night. The concept sounded pretty interesting, like something out of a Yakuza movie or something...in any case, it didn't prove to be as neat as it sounded.  First off, this restaurant really is on the EDGE of town. We knew that going in to it, so that's not really a complaint, just an observation. Be prepared to drive pretty far if you live anywhere in the Valley other than the Northwest.  We got to the Geisha House and it was pretty busy. There was a small line to get in, maybe five minutes of waiting at the most, and then we were faced with the host. He took out Groupons and told us it would be $5 required gratuity. We said that would be fine, and then he said we had to pay it right then before entering. We begrudgingly paid the man, were each given a drink ticket and a hostess seated us outside on the covered patio.  I was surprised to find that there was no waitress that came and took our drink order. Instead, we had to go inside to the bar, which had a massive line, in order to get our drinks. They didn't even bring glasses of water to the table, so drink tickets had to be used for ANY drink, not just alcoholic ones. I ended up using mine on a bottle of water, and I had to purchase another for $2 after I drank it. Sort of cheesy, if you ask me.  Onto the Naked Sushi bit! In my head, I had imagined that we would have had our own table with a gorgeous naked woman on it with delicious sushi lined up for the taking....this was not so. It was more of a glorified buffet line, where everybody filed around a large circular cooking station in the corner of the restaurant. There were hot items, and in the middle of the line-up were two women with some truly nasty looking sushi laying on their bodies (leaves laid on the skin prevented the sushi from touching their bodies). I tried a bit of each piece and it was terrible! Not to mention that the girls were not exactly attractive and they looked like they wanted to kill someone while they were laying there. The hostess was actually far more attractive than the Naked Sushi girls, which isn't what I would have expected.  The saving grace, or the only grace, of this place were the chicken wings and fried rice. They were pretty tasty and we all loaded up our plates in abundance with those two items.   This sounded like it would be a good experience online, but proved to be rather disappointing when it came down to it.",

I have been to  many Japanese teppanyaki style grills over the years and this one is defiantly in my top 5.  The servers were very helpful and attentive and kept up with the flow even though they were slammed.  The chef showed up about 30 minutes after we were seated. From the time we were seated and fed we were there for about an hour and half. The food was great, but there are a lot of fillers (fried rice) since the meat portions are small and you may not get as much meat as someone else since the chef cuts all the meat portions at once and attempts to portion it out evenly, however, due to the amount of food you leave very full!  As in True teppanyaki style the chefs are very entertaining and great with children!  Overall I will definitely be back to the Geisha House!",

I think they need to take it easy a little bit and don't try so hard. At first I thought I'm in a car dealership and they are trying to sell me various items on the menu.  Hibachi was very good though. I had steak and shrimp and really enjoyed watching the cook preparing it. Steak was very tender and perfectly cooked. Would probably go back there again for hibachi.",

One salad had too much dressing and mine had none at all.  Many apologies were given for the tardiness and free ice cream was promised and provided...but overall it seemed that most of the tables were getting the \"sorry we're running behind\" routine.    The ice cream when it arrived had obviously been sitting in the freezer for some time already plated up. Overall its ok...and they were getting ready for their Naked Sushi night, which I see gets mixed reviews. (one of the tables across from us asked for a sushi roll as we were finishing up and they said that they had shut down the sushi bar to prep for the naked sushi night.  In the end, the kids like it, but I can think of better ways to spend 30.00 a head.",

We had our 4 young kiddos with us and were wanting to celebrate our 13 year wedding anniversary so we splurged and decided to go inside and check it out.  It was a lot of fun, but a lot of food for my young 'uns.  So.. we brought home quite a bit.  We did have my youngest two (ages 5 5 and 6) share a meal.  I love the pink rice and I love the soup that comes with the meal.  The show was so-so. Our cook had a few problems flipping his egg. Oh well.. I think he was a newbie.  I have had better at other Teppanyaki places, but the kids were very impressed. We would go again, but it will not be anytime soon!",

They have a incredibly large sushi menu, but only 2 or 3 items that said they do not contain crab--and I don't like crab.  I ordered gyoza, which appeared to be deep fried, and the yummy or yum-yum sushi, which claimed, on the menu, NOT to have crab.  When it arrived, it was filled with crab.  Both the waitress and the sushi chef told me 90% of the items contain crab--in fact they said it was IMITATION CRAB.  I had the chef make me something without crab, and it was OK, but am disappointed in the menu and the deceptive descriptions.  In addition, it seems to be a VIOLATION to serve imitation crab without indicating that on the menu.  I will be looking into the legality of this.  If you don't want crab, or krab, skip the sushi here.  I assume the offerings are the same at the other branches.",

We walked in and got seated right away since there was no one really there at 4:30pm. We sat there for more than 15 minutes and no one even acknowledged us! I made eye contact with plenty of servers to try and get their attention and no one came by to even say \"we will be with you in a moment\". Instead they just walked around not doing much of anything at all and helping the 3 other tables around us. A group of 4 that seems to frequent this place came in after us and got their order taken right away. We promptly left after noticing that and do not plan on coming back, which is unfortunate since we planned on becoming regulars.",

I was told we would be the last table before the \"hibachi\" chef was off and we were fine with that.  When we arrived, they weren't busy so that was good, everyone was seated, drinks gotten and orders taken. So the cooking part\" show is supposed to start. YEAH RIGHT.....   The chef barely said anything to us the entire time. The only interactive thing he did was make a heart out of the rice and throw the spice shaker and catch it once or twice. He banked a beat with his utensils and said \"alright\" a lot. But that's it. NO INTERACTION, NO JOKES, NADA! His whole routine lasted  maybe 45 minutes and we had to remind him my son had steak and lobster, and he was like oh yeah, yeah I have it right here, threw it on and did a volcano, and threw the volcano in the trash after.  The food was good which is why they get 2 stars, but the show was the worst.Next time, we go back to Osaka!  For $350 I expected much more",

About 3 weeks ago early in the morning we were walking through the court yard on way home from Walmart. As we approached a man in all black & ski mask had a sledge hammer & smashed the window right in front of me! Locked eyes with me...I'm disabled but still ran into Decatur Ave to call 911.( I cant drive due to injuries & just wanted milk!)  Today my son finally over the trauma of it we went in. I asked the lady if the manager was in, she said not til after 4. So we told her & asked if everything turned out OK & nobody got hurt..(the windows are still boarded up.) Not even a THANK YOU! why bother doing the right thing when the no big deal attitude as it happened b4 acc to her..I truly hoped in my mind I saved them from loosing property!! I HATE THIEVES! We could've ran off & minded our own business but that's not GOD's way & horrible karma! Wasn't looking for anything but a thank you & glad that sledge hammer didn't hit one of us in the face...I'm talking inches in front of us as he smashed the glass & had it raised up towards me.Needless to say it will be awhile b4 we return. PS: update w/ PD as it took over 10 mins on phone cuz they didn't have your correct address..Walmart, next to dickies, port a sub's was all I could get out in my panic.  My review isn't the food, just the attitude I got. God Bless & best of luck in the future.",

His sushi knowledge is vast and if you tell him what kind of flavors you like, he'll pin point what's right for you.  We love the salmon seeker and always enjoy the sashimi which can only be enjoyed at places where the fish is fresh.  We also enjoy the full bar and the service is always great! A North Las Vegas find.",

Honestly, my husband and I came here for lunch a week after going to a $300 hibachi/Japanese restaurant in a 5-Star hotel & at a fraction of price, Geisha tasted so much better. We ate hibachi and had chicken, steak, shrimp and lobster. All were tastey & Their fried rice is good (had to get over the color first).  Great place for kids and the experience. But they really really need a deep clean before I come back. I'm so close to being a germaphobe and I couldn't get over the dust so I had an uneasy feeling the entire time.",

    "text": "If you are having a large group or party then stay away from This place they can't handle that level of service !! We had a reserved party of 15 last weekend for my mother's Birthday, It started off well had a had a upbeat attendant Jebb who got our drinks and took our orders. we had reserved a section that as supposed to have two grills so the whole party could have the show and get the entire experience.    Issue #1 Once it came time to start it was discovered that they forgot to turn on one of the grills so only one side of the party was going to be able to partake in the chefs cooking skills the rest only got to see the back of him.    Issue #2 They completely messed up who had what and literally took four different people to explain and they still didn't get it right we basically just had to switch plates when the food came.   Issue #3 They dumped the rice on the floor when they where bringing out the sides to cook.   issue #4 Because there was only one grill, only one cook was responsible for cooking for the entire party of 15 so each side like the rice came first 10min later the veggies came and 10 min later the meat came so you basically had to eat them as they came or your plate would have been cold !  Issue #5 when the bill came we won't even go there that was a nightmare in itself for them to get it right !!   It is unfortunate because We usually visit the other location many times for bdays and have had great service but have never been to this location with this big of party. The manager could have come over and at least apologized or did something for us given the experience that we had but all they wanted to do was basically just point fingers at each other for the issues we had experienced. Jebb was great but the others looked looked like they didn't want to even be there. I always tip and I did very well but for a bill that is more then my MORTGAGE PAYMENT I suggest large parties stay away from this location .",

I miss the good ole days! Yvonne, always a smiling face ready to make your experience the best it could be. Felix was always on point and by far one of the best Chefs Geisha ever hired. Cody is still behind bar and we love him. Unfortunately,  he is not enough to bring us back.  Today, it is unlikely you will recognize the Chefs, servers or management. I assume they don't stay long or get fired for lack of ability to provide a great experience or good food.  When considering this establishment I recommend not waisting your time or money. At right around $40 per person for the Geisha Special ( was once my favorite ) there is many other fine dining in this town to check out and you are less likely to be disappointed.",

Aside from that, the couple at the bar had free access to roam behind the bar, ring up their own tab and frequent the kitchen at leisure. Not sure if they are employees or friends. In any case it promotes an uncomfortable and unprofessional environment. The sushi was average at best as well.",

He LOVES the geisha special $36 (lobster,chicken, and filet) since you get the works, a drink, and the HUGE  shrimp tempura as the appetizer.  This time I got the land lovers special $33 (filet,new York strip, chicken) with shrimp tempura. Figured I would get this since I was sharing with the little one. I must say I made the right choice because I have a ton of food leftover for lunch tomorrow. This time we brought the 2 older kids and they loved it! I suppose we will be back in a couple months for one of their birthdays. :) the only downside tonight was it was extremely smokey, but totally understandable since it was super busy..all tables in use. All in all another trip we left full and satisfied.",

Sad to say, but they know me by name and greet me each time I visit! :) The rolls are well made and each chef does an equally good job of preparing what you order.  The managers are always present and go out of their way to ensure you are enjoying your dining experience.  Negatives: they can be somewhat pricey. They used to have a happy hour that offered by two get one free rolls (great for pairs), but it seems to phase in and out of availability.  They also have late night naked sushi/party (I think they alternate weeks with the Fort Apache location), but when we tried to go it was kinda dead in there...but I've heard that it is usually a hot spot! *shrug*   Overall, I have repeatedly found the food to be well-prepared, fresh/good quality and the staff is friendly enough to make me feel comfortable and welcome. I vote try it for yourself!",

    "text": "Drove in here for some lunch after my am workout. We were the only customers  save 1 lady who was waiting for her party to arrive. We were promptly seated, and given menus. Had a little snafu w/ the wee one and the bathroom, but our waitress was completely patient and understanding! Lil one had the Chicken Udon, I had the pork tonkatsu bento box (complete with tempura, salad w/ginger dressing, 4pc cal roll, and rice), along with a side of edamame.  Don't know the edamame was a little underdone still, but the pods were falling apart..normally doesn't happen, but didn't ruin the meal for me. Rest of the food was tasty. Typical tempura but still light and tasty. typical pork tonkatsu, nothing that is super outstanding, but noticed they will drizzle the pieces with the tonkatsu sauce, and mayo in a neat criss cross pattern.   Now I have to give the waitress, Sierra, mad props! I mean talk about customer service. She was top notch! From seating us, til we left she was spot on for impeccable timing in attending to our needs! While waiting for our food to come out - we got the customary soup. Three groups came in for their lunch, but Sierra was managing it all very swiftly without missing a beat!  Tiny annoyance to note - the bus guy (young man - college age from the looks of it) - kept popping out of the kitchen every couple of minutes checking on tables. Granted with only 4 tables occupied not much work to do, but still - doesn't require checking on us so frequently! That's my observation not enough to lower a star, but something for management to take note of maybe to impart on this young man. :)  Thank you Geisha House once again for yummy food!",

The tepanyaki chefs are great with the guests, as are the waiters and waitresses. I have 0 complaints other than the fact it's hard to go last minute because they're always packed!

    "text": "We used to love this place but this is the second visit in as many months where we have been severely disappointed.  We gave them the benefit of the doubt and returned tonight, but won't be back again.  The restaurant opened at 5pm and we arrived at 5:10.  The majority of hibachi tables were full, there were 6 people at the bar; 4 having drinks, and 2 others eating.  The dining area, about 10 tables, only had one party of 4.  The hostess said she would not be able to seat us in the nearly empty restaurant for 15 - 20 minutes because she didn't want to overwhelm staff.  When we asked if we could have a table and just look at the menu, she declined at first, but then sat us.  We watched, throughout our meal, customers being told they had to wait.  After about 25 minutes, the 4 people at the bar were escorted to a hibachi table, and that just left the two that were eating, and it became apparent that they knew one of the sushi chefs.  One young couple who asked to sit in the dining area and were told to wait, asked if they could sit at the bar and the hostess directed them to \"sit here\", directly next to the other two that were currently eating - there were 12 other seats available at the bar. When we finally placed our order, 3 bowls of miso soup, 4 orders of sashimi, one sushi roll, and one order of shrimp and vegetable tempura, the tempura came out with shrimp only.  The sushi roll and sashimi came out next, but we were told the miso soup was delayed because it was \"warming up\".  (I'm not sure how they managed to give the 2 hibachi tables soup, because they all had it).  When it finally did arrive at the end of the meal, it was luke-warm at best.   They will not have the opportunity to ruin a third meal for my family because we will not be back.",

Anyways, this time the restaurant was ok.  The restaurant looks very nice, and it's clean. The chairs are too low for the tables, though. I wasn't the only one who felt like I needed a highchair. The actual high chairs they brought for our toddlers were almost the same height as our chairs, leaving the kids with no chance to see the top of the table, let alone the show. They had to stand on our laps to see anything and I ended up holding a plate at my daughter's level for her to eat.  The service was very good. All the waiters and the chef were friendly and accomodating. We had a young child with us, who was a little scared of some of the flashy parts of the dining show, so the chef toned it down a little for her, but still put on a great show.  The sushi and accompanying appetizers were excellent! Oh, it was sooo good. The rest of the dinner, however, left me a smidgen dissappointed. The chef added a pink paste to everything he cooked. On the one hand, it had an interesting flavor. On the other hand, it made everything taste the same. He may as well have just fried up some pink paste and served us just that. :\\  I would go back for the sushi.",

My tables waiter then proceeded to yell over to the sushi chef that I said the scallops were not bad, and the chef argued with me. Now, this is when I got extremely P.O.ed and told them to take the roll back, don't bring anything else, and don't charge me. Lucky they agreed or they would have been hearing from me again the next day when I was sick to my stomach. I can only imagine what would have happened to me had I eaten more than one piece...Don't risk your life by trying this dive...",

    "text": "Decided to stop in with my husband this past Friday night. Made a reservation, which seemed like a good idea because we were immediately seated at one of the teppanyaki stations. (If you're bringing in a group, Definitely make a reservation). It was pretty busy, with people waiting outside.  We both ordered the special of the night; half filet mignon and half lobster. He got the full hot sake and I got a half of their pomegranate sake, which just tasted like pomegranate juice watered down (dangerous perhaps, because I did feel it!). The chef was a lot of fun. Soup and salad came out first, with the salad being your usual fare. The soup was interesting- tasted like beef broth with French's fried onions. I liked it, but it didn't seem very Japanese. Everything else was very good. I would like to add, don't know if it happened to anyone else, but they have this 'special spice' that they add to everything on the grill; looks like pink paste. It makes everything pink. Just a heads up.  I would go here again, but only after I've tried everything else Vegas has to offer.",
