The long line was a sure sign of this establishment's popularity and reputation for what must have been one of the best sandwiches ever right? Well, imo it was okay. I must say tho that for me the fresh baked bread was the savior of the sandwich. Sorry Earl, I'm saving my tummy for the many other eateries in lv.",

I don't normally review chains but this one was worth it.  I walked here and back to my hotel with my sandwich in less than 30 minutes and the sandwich was absolutely delicious.  I had The Earl's Club and a bag of original kettle chips and my total was just a tad over $8.  That's a steal for food on the Strip!  The sandwich was perfectly toasted, just enough to warm it and give the outside a nice crunch but with a nice, soft inside.  Perfect proportions of meat, cheese, sauce and veggies to hold it together and get a nice bite each time.  I couldn't have asked for a better sandwich!",

I definitely could have eaten two of them, but still they were delicious :) Definitely a good, cheap, tasty sandwich spot.   The caribbean jerk chicken is especially good and the caprese looked really tempting.",

But then again, all 3 times I went, it was about 2am. Doesn't really matter what sandwich you get, you'll love it. If they made a seaweed sandwich with snot dressing, it'd probably be enjoyable at this place. I thought the $5 footlong was a good deal until now. How bout the $6 earl? And the best part is, the sportsbook is right next to it. Nice place to eat before you continue to drink yourself into oblivion. And the yogurt parfaits are pretty dern tasty after a night of drinkin'. Long live the earl. I eagerly await for 1 to pop up next to every sarbucks in the world.",

It was like a bit crispy but not too crispy that it'll crumble everywhere onto your clothes when you bite into it. Overall, very satisfied with the burgers there. Prices were great",

    "text": "Excellent sandwiches!!  I've gone here a handful of times and the food is delicious for anything comparable in price in Vegas.  The reason for the lower rating is that the last time I went, their 'system went down for 30 minutes' which apparently means they aren't able to make a sandwich.  So there were 10 or so employees standing around with knives, meat and bread right in front of them.  I'm guessing either the employees wouldn't know how to count change without a computer, or the management has no plan in place to service the customer when something like that happens.  Quite disappointing.  After 5 minutes of waiting I went somewhere else.  The chances of this happening to the readers are probably low, so don't let this stray you from their great sandwiches.",

I always get the Tuna Melt Sandwich because in my opinion I think it is one of the best sandwiches on their menu and I'm not even really a big fan of tuna. I think all their sandwiches are good because it's the bread that actually stands out.  The cost is $6.49 for the sandwich. The chicken ceasar salad was $6.99 and not worth it's price. It is relatively small with a few chopped lettuce, very little chicken, some croutons, shaved parmesan and very little dressing that comes with it. You are better off getting another sandwich which is cheaper or adding soup to your order.  I've had the broccoli cheddar soup and it's pretty good. Soda is $2.49 but you get unlimited refills.  If you gamble and have a Diamond or Seven Stars Total Rewards card you can bypass the long lines and go to the front as well as use your points to pay for your meal. Don't worry, the line goes fast even if you do have to wait in those long lines.",

I'm not sure what bread they use, but for sure it's what seperates their sandwiches from other sandwich places.

I was first introduced to these sandwiches when my family and I were exploring Plant Hollywood's Miracle Mile shops and the then \"new\" PH Westgate condos. We stopped by here after one of the hostess recommended it and I've been a fan ever since.  I enjoy the variety they offer, especially on their signature hot sandwich menu. I've had a couple and they are all tasty. These are a couple of my favorites, depending on what food mood I am in.  For a tasty well-rounded sandwich, I'd go with The Full Montagu (Freshly Roasted Beef, Turkey, Aged Swiss & Sharp Cheddar Cheese, Lettuce, Roma Tomatoes & the Earl's Mustard Sauce).  For something tangy and sweet, I'd go with the Caribbean Jerk Chicken (Grilled Chicken, Roasted Red & Banana Peppers & Spicy Jerk Sauce).  For something healthy and light I'd go with the Caprese (Fresh Mozzarella, Roma Tomato, Fresh Basil & Drizzled Balsamic Vinaigrette).  One of my favorites remains the Italian because of my love for salami. (Salami, Capicola, Ham, Mortadella, Zesty Italian Dressing, Mozzarella & Roma Tomato (Peppers Optional).  A great place to eat, no matter what time of the day.  I'd also recommend their ice cream brownie sandwich because the brownie \"halves\" are rich and filling.",

I think a lot of the hype comes from the relatively cheap prices and how it's open 24 hours. Overall, it's a good sandwich, but definitely not the best I've ever had!  My favorite part about the sandwich is their artisan baked loaf, that is the right thickness for the amount of filling there is. It has a crunchy exterior and the chewy inside that I like. The chipotle chicken is probably my favorite, with the fresh avocados inside adding that creamy and fresh flavor. The chicken is average, but the chipotle mayo added a kick which I love in sandwiches. The Caribbean jerk chicken was also pretty good, with the same chicken but banana peppers and a spicy jerk sauce. I always love banana peppers in my sandwiches, so that was a good pairing with the chicken. The Hawaiian BBQ chicken was just average, especially because the pineapple tasted like canned pineapple. The BBQ sauce was also a little too sweet for my taste. It's definitely not a bad sandwich, especially when it's 2 AM and you're in need of food!",

My boyfriend had the hawaiian sandwich, which had chicken, ham, pineapple and BBQ sauce. This was surprisingly good as well! I'm a huge sandwich fan. I always look forward to new creations. I especially get excited for the day after Thanksgiving, when I take carved turkey and stuff it in a freshly toasted french bread with avocado, jalapenos, cracked pepper and drowned in gravy. The Holiday sandwich is definitely comparable and I look forward to our next encounter...hopefully somewhere in Northern California :).",

This is a 24 hour joint so it's perfect after a long night of dancing at the club.  It's also good for the morning after a long night of dancing at the club.  Honestly Earl's sandwich is good any time of the day or night.  Lines can be long but they move fast, trust me it's worth the wait!!!   Their mini brownies are so good too! Anything Earls, I am a fan!! A definite must try while in Vegas.",

I came back twice just because I liked it so much.  I dug the Veggie (lent) and it was pretty awesome!  I also had the full Montague and it was delish as well.  The meat is perfection, nice and rare and juicy, I just wish I could have a huge pile of the meat!  The Caprese was okay, I kinda felt like it was an afterthought.  And their was only one piece of basil for the entire sandwich....I'd skip that one next time.  Someone should open up a franchise in LA because it would make a killing.",

    "text": "Earl Of Sandwich, where taste meets value...tal-ue? I'm just saying.  This is probably the best value on the strip for food because how tasty the food was and that my meal was under $10. I was lucky enough to eat here twice and both times with my lady and I was fortunate enough to split my sandwich with her as she did with her sandwich. Thus I was able to try 4 different sandwiches during my 2 visits. Here's what I had:  *1/2 a BLT ~ amazingly bacon-y!! *1/2 Full Montagu ~ multiple flavors bursting from every bite *1/2 Club ~ great mix of bacon and yummy meats *1/2 Italian ~ Hands down the BEST Italian sandwich ever!!!!!  The bread is so...so...perfect. It was fresh, crispy, and just...perfect. The bread was so good that it makes me wonder why the toasted bread from Quizno's and other sandwich establishments suck so badly.  On my next trip to Vegas I plan on coming here multiple times no matter where I am staying. Heck, I might have to book my room at Planet Hollywood just so I'll be that much closer to Earl of Sandwich. Dare I say I might go there for breakfast, lunch, and dinner? Oh, I dare!!",

I've tried the chipotle chicken avocado sandwich, Earl's club, and the full montagu and everything just tasted so fresh and amazing. It's hard to pick a favorite but I'd have to go with the chipotle chicken avocado. You just can't beat that perfect blend of toasty, warm bread, savory chipotle chicken, and fresh avocado. Now if only the portions were a teeenyyy bit bigger. They also offer other soups, salads, and sides that you can pick up for a fuller more satisfying meal though!   It's open 24/7 so you can come by anytime you want (drunchies anyone?) Also the line will be long regardless of when you come but they handle it very efficiently. Each sandwich is about $7 including tax, but compared to the other expensive food on the strip, it's well worth the time and money.",

I've been here about a half dozen times, and to be honest I can't remember what I get each time, but everytime I've gone and with everyone I've gone with we agree this ranks up there with the best of the sandwiches.  Along with that they offer some baked goods that are also out of this world.  I know this place has location, convenience, and you must think... can a sandwich really be worthy of a 5 star, and yes, I think this one deserves it.  Tourists, casino industry workers, other vegas business folk and clientelle....  .. ..  at all hours of the day and night and day, you'll see this is a very diverse go-to-spot.  And while for a sandwich you might pay a little more than average it's also one of the chepest spots in the area for food, so if you are looking for inexpensive grub and you happen to be at the Planet Hollywood this is hands down your place.  I make this place at least every visit to Vegas I can.",

    "text": "What is there left to say when 653 other Yelpers have already spilled the beans about the Earl of Sandwich? There was only one thing left to do which was to see what the hype was all about myself.   The place is located inside the Planet Hollywood across from the sports book. It's open 24/7 for all you lovely belligerent and drunk, 5 inch heels in hand meaning blackened Hobbit feet, crusted yack on chin folks. The Earl just might be your savior.  For a measly $5-6, you can get a nice, freshly made and toasted sandwich. There are many options to choose from such as the classic club to the Hawaiian bbq. Of course there are other items on the menu like their rich tomato soup (I recommend the croutons on the side), salads, wraps, and so forth.   The word about the Earl of Sandwich is out so don't go bezerk if you see a pessimistic long line. Their efficient staff will keep the lines steadily moving and it shouldn't take too long for the orders to be called. The only downfall is possibly the seating for it may fill up quickly.  On our most recent trip to Sin City, we stopped by Earl's twice due to the fact that we stayed at PH and so it was always a short walk away. On a random note, I would like to state that for some odd reason I enjoyed the sandwiches from Earl the next morning after it was left out over night more than straight out of the oven. Perhaps it was the hangover munchies?  Give the Earl a hollar if you're ever in the (702) area code.",

Their Tuna Melt sandwich is highly recommended as it uses a good amount of albacore tuna that's not dressed in a lot of mayonnaise and Swiss cheese that stretches when melted. Just wished it had some dice or sliced tomatoes to give the sandwich more complexity. I wasn't impressed with their Caribbean Jerk Chicken sandwich because if it had the Caribbean spicy jerky sauce, then it was missing or negligible on my palate. But the grilled chicken strips and red and banana peppers had good flavor. The breads they use to assemble their sandwiches are baked or toasted perfectly.",

The four sandwiches were: The Caprese The Montagu The Tuna Melt The Caribbean Jerk Chicken  My Favorite by far was the Tuna Melt!!! I added lettuce and tomato to mine! AMAZING!!!! seriously the perfect texture! I felt the Montagu had great potential but the sauce (kinda sweet) really ruined it for me, next time I would request sauce on the side! The Caprese was also REALLY good! Personally I would have liked the Mozzarella slightly toasted but STILL AMAZING! Lastly was the Caribbean, I enjoyed it, tasted good...but compared to the others, I probably wouldn't get it again! I really want to try the Hawaiian BBQ next time! This place IS AMAZING, CHEAP (especially for vegas) SOOO WORTH GOING! The ONLY bad thing was the 10-15 minute wait which was worth every bite!!!! :) THIS PLACE IS AWESOME!",

When I got to the cashier I was able to add on the other items I wanted but with a lot of attitude from the girl at the register. The food came pretty quickly, which was nice, and the sandwich was really good. The tomato soup, however, was really the worst I've had anywhere with very stale tasting croutons. Not too bad of a place to eat, but the staff definitely need to work on their attitude and customer service. (That being said, I seem to run into a lot of this in Vegas. Maybe it's just the customary atmosphere...) If you get a chance, I would highly recommend Panera Bread instead.",

I definitely will go back when I'm in vegas again.",

I was hoping Earl of Sandwich would break the curse, but it didn't.  The sandwiches are good, but not worth going out of your way for. If you're only in Vegas for a limited number of meals or not staying at Planet Hollywood or a hotel directly next to it, don't make the trip here. If you're drunk and stumbling around for late night food, Earl of Sandwich is your place.   The horseradish sauce on the Original was good, but strong. I couldn't taste the meat!  Chipotle Chicken Avocado was on the tasteless side. The line was out the door and every table was full, but I didn't wait more than 10 minutes. My sandwich came out hot and fresh in 5! Under $7 for a sandwich. The sandwiches are pretty small.   Earl of Sandwich is on the opposite end of the Miracle Mile shops parking garage.",

Stepping in off the busy street just a block from Times Square, you immediately feel a calm only Japanese hospitality can provide. Allow yourself to be ushered to the 10-seat counter that doesn't feature the sushi case ubiquitous to most sushi restaurants for an intimate and deliberate experience. There is no rush, the ingredients are high-quality, and the delivery and presentation are precise (you'll be reminded that pieces come pre-seasoned with wasabi). That's a good thing, given that Sushi Zen is one of the city's few spots to serve fugu, the pufferfish delicacy that can be deadly if not prepared correctly. Chef Toshio Suzuki is a master whose omakase is always on-point, if a little on the expensive side. While a sushi omakase technically starts at $65, you're likely to want extra pieces beyond that, at which point things can start adding up quickly.",

Process starts off with ordering with the employee at the far left corner (There is no signage of this). You'll be presented a pager and you'll pay at the two registers at the very right using the receipt that was given to you by the first employee.  After paying, you wait for your sandwich using the buzzer. When the buzzer beeps, you head back to the counter, towards the very right hand side to pick up your order.   ...the process would have been much easier if the \"sections\" were properly tagged...  The full Motagu sandwich was good. It was fresh but on the smaller side. It was a good experience, but not sure if I'll stop by next time...

The service was awesome and the staff answers any of your questions in a friendly manner.    The sandwiches are cut in half already, so it's perfect for sharing two different types like I did with one of my friends. (:  Each sandwich costs about $7-8? and their sizing is ok.  You won't be overly stuffed with the portion, but I was content.  CHIPOTLE CHICKEN AVOCADO: This sandwich came with grilled chicken, bacon, cheddar, avocado, lettuce, and this bomb chipotle sauce! I loved it and would totally order this again!!  HAWAIIAN BBQ: This sandwich comes with grilled chicken, ham, swiss, pineapple, and bbq sauce.  I'm not usually a fan of hawaiian pizza or sandwiches, but this was awesome!!  I loved both the sandwiches and their flavorful tastes.  Definitely stop by if you can! (:",

I've tried the other sandwiches, but this one is just the most memorable for me.

I have tried the Mediterranean Chicken Wrap, the Earl's Club, and All American. And I must say the Earl's Club is the best comforting food. Their artisan bread is excellent, and the portion size is reasonable.  If you're seeking a cheap hearty midnight snack that is going to satisfy your hunger, this is the place to go because it's open 24 hours. And it's convenient to find because it's right off the strip in the Miracle Mile Shops at Planet Hollywood.",

The food came out quick, considering how busy they were.  The prices were reasonable, and the food actually had flavor. And I mean the food, not the dressing and condiments.    The meat is fresh, the bread is tasty, and its neatly wrapped.  In fact, all of the Sandwiches come out neatly wrapped.  I didn't see anything thrown together or messy.  I have NEVER seen a Sandwich or Deli care about presentation. They do.  If your on the strip and want a simple sandwich for $5.99, that really isn't simple but really fantastic, go to Planet Hollywood and stop by.  You shouldn't be disappointed.  Oh, they also have a breakfast sandwich for 3.99. Yum.",

Since most places are closed after the clubs get out, I'm so happy that the Earl of Sandwiches fulfills its civic duty to remain open for all the drunken hungry hot messes to replenish their lost energy. I've had their sandwiches both while under the influence and sober, and neither times have disappointed me, so it must not be the alcohol talking :D  Earl's Club will never do you wrong, and the Tuna Melt isn't half bad either.  Plus, who can beat a bomb gourmet sandwich for less than $7 in a city that's so saturated with overpriced restaurants and vendors?  Nobody can. And that's why Earl of Sandwiches gets 5 stars for being awesome!",

    "text": "Before I begin my review, a little Yelp history lesson.  The name comes from the apocryphal tale about the Earl of Sandwich (an actual position of nobility in the UK).  It was rumored that the Earl was gambling late into the night and in order to eat his meals at the table asked the chef to put the meat and vegetables between two pieces of bread. Voila, the sandwich is born.  Wikipedia doesn't mention this story and other sources on the subject say it's probably not True.  Now you know why this place is called the Earl of Sandwich and why it's fitting that it's in a casino.   The lines for lunch on Saturday afternoon tend to be long, but it's worth it.  All of the sandwiches, wraps, and salads were $5.99.  I also had a coffee that brought my total with tax to $8.50 or so.  I ordered the Montagu, which had roast beef in it.  The roast beef was much better than I would expect from a sandwich shop -- it was very juicy and was actual slices from a roast and not the typical deli slices (which has the potential to be chopped and formed odds and ends from the butcher).    The sandwich is smaller compared with with a Subway or Quizno's sub, but the quality is infinitely better.  If you're looking for a cheap lunch (or late night bite since it's open 24-hours) I'd recommend the Earl of Sandwich.  It's at the entrance of the Miracle Mile shops at the Planet Hollywood, so you can make a quick entrance/getaway if you don't feel like getting sucked into a mall or casino.",

Somehow my friends and I always end up here after a fun night out clubbing and we're starving and want some good, simple food fast.  Sandwiches are a great price for the taste (and for being on the Las Vegas Strip) -- $6-8.  There's also a variety of drinks, desserts, snacks, soups and a kid's meal. I tried the caprese sandwich, tasted great.  Ordered an Earl's Frozen Lemonade.  It was very very sweet, way too sweet.  Felt like I was drinking lemon syrup.  It was under $3 and I was dehydrated, so I didn't waste too much money.  I also ordered a soup, which is also at a low price of about $3.",

I didn't want to chew anything, I'd much rather prefer soup if I was to eat anything at all.  My friend insisted on walking (another activity I was dreading) to PH to get Earl of Sandwich though.  FML. I'd passed this place many times before, not really caring for a sandwich in Vegas.  I can always remember it being busy though.  Now I know why.  Even with my busted taste buds, I could still taste that this sandwich was definite hangover goodness.  The tortilla soup, while a little too thick for me, still had flavor and went down easy on the throat. All of this for only about $13 bucks with a drink.  I'm going to have to come back at the beginning of a Vegas trip next time.",

Ask for the halves to be separately wrapped and then peel the wrapper like a burrito if you want to be neat about it.  Cheddar soup and tomato soup are both good, due largely to the rich, creamy factor. :) Jerk chicken sandwich is the best. Bread is toasted when you order; meats are roasted that morning. Yes, the business owners are related to THAT Earl of Sandwich, the famous gambler and inventor of handy meals.  $6 for sandwiches, $3 for soups. Open 24 hours with a lot of tables. Lotsa gawkers because it's right on the edge of the casino & the mall. Also, really poor cell phone reception.  Attractive counter staff.",

It was so good that I had to eat extra fast so he couldn't ask for another bite.  :P  I took that last star off for his sandwich.  The club was pretty mediocre.  Definitely get The Original instead!",

I was surprised there was such a line on Christmas day for Earl of Sandwich at 2am, but it was my first time in Vegas -- so what do I know?  I had the Holiday Turkey and it was incredible! If you're hear around the holiday times, I definitely suggest it! It's been mentioned a few times before, but it's truly a festive sandwich: roasted turkey, gravy, STUFFING(!!) and cranberry sauce in between two deliciously toasted pieces of bread. The flavors came together super nice. My wife opted for something vegetarian, but even she took a bite and instantly had sandwich envy.  So, my friends...if you want to give sandwich envy to your SO -- get the Holiday Turkey. Don't be intimated by the large line, it moves relatively fast and the sandwiches are worth waiting for (and very inexpensive).",

Seriously, with all the Instagram pics, Facebook posts, and friends telling me to go here, my expectations were at the highest of highs. But, Earl of Sandwich actually lived up to it!  Ended up following Yelp's suggestion and got the Chipotle Chicken Avocado. I actually don't even like avocados, but hey Yelp rarely leads me astray so I just leaped right in. Super tasty, and I loved that the whole thing wasn't dry at all. Size was just about right for a guy my size, but I could see how portion size could be a problem for someone with a bigger appetite than me.  I can definitely see how this spot would be a fan favorite on the strip. Service was quick, the price was A-OK, and you get a pretty darn good sandwich out of it all, so I'll definitely be back next time I'm in Vegas!",

First thing I noticed was the very reasonable prices-- a meal for under $10 is always a good thing. But, don't be fooled, you get what you pay for because the portions are pretty tiny.   I got a berry chicken salad, my sister got a Baja chicken salad, and my friend got the chipotle chicken sandwich. The bread on the sandwich earns this place their two stars but the salads were Wendy's quality, but smaller.   The chicken quality is terrible. It's processed chicken that is salted to death and not good. They skimp on ingredients and it is very forgettable.   For the amount of reviews and amazing rating I was expecting to at least be happy but I left very disappointed. Skip.",

For 7 bucks, it's a great sandwich, especially after a long night of drinking. Being open 24/7 is definitely a smart business move because not a lot of things are open during those hours in Vegas.   I usually always plan to stay around PH just for Earl's because let's face it, we all have to each to survive in Vegas. I've never been disappointed with my sandwich, and I always get multiples. Be aware that the lines could be line sometimes, and I mean long.. especially during rush hours. My advice is to call in and order, go down and pay, the wait will be less.",

Grabbing a late night sandwich is my Vegas rite of passage and marks that \"I have arrived!\"  My go to sandwich is the Holiday Turkey.  Hands down, it's Thanksgiving in a handheld sandwich.  Turkey, cranberry, stuffing.... it's such a filling, comforting combo!  Love how it is warm and toasty as well.  This location can get long lines depending on the time of day, but I lucked out to have no line around 1:30am-ish when I passed by.  But, as soon as I left, there was a long line that developed.  After a late night of drinks and clubbing, or when taking a break from the slot machines, make sure to stop by!",

A decent selection of hot sandwiches, breakfast and lunch/dinner choices, some cold wraps and even some fresh salads. You order and get a buzzer and it's self seating. We sat down for just a few minutes and already the buzzer went off pretty quickly. You pick up the food in a bag so it's easy to take with you but we ate there.  I got 'the original' which is roast beef, cheddar and horse radish. It was delicious. A fair amount of all the ingredients and the roast beef was really tasty. The salad seemed very fresh (forgot the name) but had strawberries, blueberries, some almond slivers and something else, and it was a healthy portion with a nice light dressing.  We were both satisfied and it cost about 17.50 which isn't bad for Vegas. I honestly kind of wanted a second sandwich, they aren't as big as I wanted but for the price it's fair. Far better than subway in quality and freshness of ingredients, however I don't think you can customize your toppings. This isn't meant to be a healthy sub.",

I like to get the light stuff, like the caprese sandwich, which I absolutely love! Filling yet refreshing.  Can't forget to pair it with the tomato soup!  It's creamy, and tomatoey, but not too overwhelming.  Some may say there is too much bread when they first look at it, but once you sink your first bite into it, there is a perfect ratio of meat to bread, and the bread is perfectly toasted, not too hard, not too soft. Pricing is reasonable. Advice, eat it the way it was meant to be eaten.. unless of course you're allergic or will die at the taste of mustard.",

There are always big lines here, but they move quickly and its well worth the wait.  I had the Tuna melt and LOVED IT.  Warm and crispy bread, perfectly blended tuna salad without a bucket of mayo hiding the flavor, this sandwich kicked me in the head with a flavor-tipped  boot of taste!  I've heard that all the sandwiches here are great, and don't doubt it.  It reminded me of Potbelly's back in Chicago if you're familiar with that place.  I actually think its better than Potbelly's.    Don't deny yourself a really great sandwich, embrace the taste of something really excellent and get thee to the Earl.",

    "text": "Wow.  Taking the recommendations from other yelpers, we ordered the Full Montagu, the Caprese, a broccoli and cheddar soup, and an ice cream sandwich made with Ghiradelli chocolate.  Everything was amazing. The roast beef was moist and complemented the turkey in the Montagu. The bread was nicely toasted, giving a nice satisfying crunch. The Caprese had a balsamic dressing that tied the sandwich together in such beautiful harmony. Next time I'll ask for the to warm or melt the cheese a bit more; I like my cheese gooey.  The broccoli and cheddar soup was like broccoli chunks in cheese soup, but somehow the flavors went well. And of course, how can you go wrong with Ghiradelli?  Amazing!! Now I'm curious to see how it would've tasted if they used California Sourdough's sourdough bread... *drools* ~*~ I couldn't help it. We came back the 3rd time this week and why not? At $6 a sandwich and open 24 hours its probably the cheapest good eats on the strip! Here's what we've sampled so far in my preferred order.  1. Full Montagu - just perfect 2. Caprese - would order it extra melty next time 3. Holiday - the gravy, cranberry, and stuffing is like warm Thanksgiving in my mouth 4. Original 1786 - classic roast beef and horseradish 5. Italian - nice flavors, but didn't jump at me  Brownie creme sandwiches are like giant brownie Oreos. Must have.  And if it's hot, the Brownie ice cream sandwiches are just as good.  Soups are good too, nice balance, not too salty and good chunky.  Did I mention the brownie sandwiches have Ghiradelli chocolate chips in them? Oh YEAH....",

I had several of the sandwiches, and all were as good or better than most other sandwich shops out there.  On my last trip to the strip, we stopped in again, and made fun of ourselves for it. It's always busy, no matter what time you go, literally. I guess that says something, with quality and price in Vegas.

While walking through the (boring) Miracle Mile shops of Planet Hollywood the day before, the name of this place caught our attention. Vlad is the sandwich lover in this relationship, so I knew we were going to have to try this place eventually.   First of all, the deli-style ordering is great if you want to grab a quick bite without the wait service. I also like that once you order, they give you a pager that vibrates when your order is ready, which keeps the line moving instead of having to impatiently wait at the counter or listen for your order number.   Vlad ordered one of the signature sandwiches with their homemade artisan bread, which looked like some warm carby deliciousness. He loved it. I ordered a flatbread wrap - delicious. The actual flatbread tasted unlike any other flatbread I've had before. Not too tortilla-like, not to bread-like. It was like really really thin, fresh pizza dough.  YES I gave in to carbs, and YES it was worth it!",

    "text": "SBC VEGAS SERIES: 8 of many reviews HUNGER!!!!!!  After a night of drinking debauchery I find myself hungry as hell. Low and behold there is this shop that is still open after hours and ready and willing to feed my alcohol induced hunger. Fortunately there wasn't much of a line however there is an extensive list. Then again anything beyond 5 items to a drunk is to be considered an extensive list. And unfortunately it doesn't help if they are unable to make the single tuna melt that I had ordered. Not wanting to wait any longer I ordered the first sandwich on the list.... which I have no recollection of what it is called. I can't tell you whether it was good. I can however tell you though that by the time I woke up that it was all gone... as was my shirt... as was my hunger... as was my buzz... and dignity.  ;D",

My other friend and I were literally on the verge of.. let's ust say \"reliving the alcohol we drank from last night, but in reverse\".. but we ordered food anyway. After a quick trip to the nearest restroom, we were greeted by the heavenly smell of our sandwiches.  Trust me, I rarely ever eat after a night of drinking but I couldn't resist! Boy was I not sorry! The sandwich was sooo good, it was the perfect hang over cure!  My Full Montague, along with a bottle of blue gatorade and a nap, were all I needed to recooperate from a good weekend ;)",

    "text": "On my last trip to Vegas, one afternoon I woke up to discover that three different groups of people I went there to meet had independently decided to go to Earl of Sandwich.  Although I had never heard of this place before, it was clear that I had to try it, and I am definitely glad that I did.  The first thing that stands out about Earl of Sandwich is the price.  When you are used to paying $8-10 for a sandwich in DC, $6 for a sandwich is fantastic.  And when that $6 sandwich tastes better than any that you're used to, it's mind-blowing to say the least.  I tried The Original 1762, a roast beef sandwich with cheddar cheese and horseradish sauce.  I also had a taste of The Full Montagu, which has roast beef, turkey, swiss, cheddar, lettuce, tomatoes and mustard.  First off, the bread is outstanding.  It's toasted and has a great crunch to it, without being overly thick.  The meats are also great and the sandwiches have a good amount on them.  Although the sandwiches are a bit on the small side, they are ok for a smaller meal, especially when paired with chips or soup (which I did not personally try, but have heard good things about).  Overall it's a great place to go and I highly recommend it.  That sandwich was one of the best I've ever had and I wish I had had time to try more of their menu.  Whether it's a late night snack or lunch, Earl of Sandwich is definitely worth checking out.",

Yeah until I came here. I have only tried one of the dozen different sandwiches. What is so great about this place is that the choices are simple so what you can concentrate on what is important. That's right! The Food!  I will be sure to come to this place many times to try all the different treasures. The bread will hook you. They have around a dozen workers in the kitchen spitting out orders like a machine. After the line went by so fast, I was thinking we would have to wait twice as long for our food but that wasn't the case. Sweet place to call one of my favorite places.",

Thanks to my boyfriend who has been raving about this place since his early Feb visit to Vegas, I finally got to check this place out over the weekend. It's located in Planet Hollywood right along the mall.  YUMMMM!!! The bread oh my gosh, soft and crispy at the same time. I devoured my shares in minutes and was tempted to get another one. I tried 3 sandwiches in one sitting (yup the best way to do it is split yours and trade with others).   The signature club was my favorite....Didn't like the roast beef and hawaiian all that much....but still loved that bread.   YOU MUST GET A SANDWICH HERE!!! IT CLAIMS TO BE THE BEST...CAN'T ARGUE WITH THAT SINCE IT'S DEFINITELY UP THERE. AT SUCH A REASONABLE PRICE...THIS IS ADDED TO MY VEGAS MUST HIT LIST!!!  Quick. Cheap. Easy. Tasty.

I don't know where all the accolades are coming from, but the Earl of Sandwich is far from Earldom in my book.  Got to admit, the pics of the sandwiches look pretty good.  But when I got  the Mediterranean Chicken Salad Wrap, I seriously thought they got my order WRONG as the dressing was the same as a Caesar's.  I could only tell the difference from the fact that the Med Chicken had red peppers and olives, while a traditional Caesar doesn't have this.  My boyfriend was also unimpressed with his BLT (which looks a lot smaller than the pictures).  Overall a disappointment given all the good reviews.  I wonder if it's all the alcohol which makes Yelpers more kindly disposed to the restaurants on the LV Strip??!!",

    "text": "There are enough places to blow your money in Vegas - go to Earl of Sandwich for one of your meals and get the best bargain in town for seriously one of the best sandwiches I've ever had anywhere!  I made sure to rush to write my review after a recent trip to Vegas because I can't rave enough about their holiday special sandwich, which is pretty much the best Thanksgiving sandwich you'll ever have anywhere (and that includes the Bobbie at Capriotti's, which is another one of my faves). The only thing is that they only offer this til January, so make sure to run over and snatch one up!  Though the ingredients are what you would expect (turkey, gravy, stuffing, cranberry), i fell in love with the flavor and quality of each of them. I think the thing that makes it is the bread, which is somehow perfectly crispy on the outside and soft and warm on the inside.   Believe the hype! Unlike a lot of other places in Vegas, Earl of Sandwich is a sure win!",

Chipotle Chicken Avocado  Portions are good and each person should be able to easily devour one sandwich. I always split 2 sandwiches with a friend to satisfy the taste buds.

My only gripe was that the salad itself was on the smaller side, and didn't have as much grilled chicken in it as I would have hoped.",

Swung by for breakfast in the early hours since this place is open 24/7! We got:  1) The Full Montague $7.45 - this is a high-end version of subway sandwiches or togo's sandwiches; warm and flavorful; prices are super reasonable too. you get a buzzer after ordering, so you can pick up your sandwiches when they are ready. Thoroughly enjoyed this sandwich! 2) The Original $7.45 - husband ordered this and thought it was delicious too; we are now fans of Earl! can't wait to try the other options on the menu in the future.  Plenty of seating in the restaurant; clean and well lit.",

The sandwich was really good. We also ordered a side of mac & cheese and it was hot and cheesy. Very good. The chocolate chip cookie was semi-soft and loaded with chocolate chips. Looking for a quick, easy, and yummy meal? Try this place out. For 2 sandwich combos and a side of mac it was roughly $28.",

Maybe I'm spoiled by the SF foodie scene; I've had my fair share of delicious sandwiches. This place doesn't even come close to Ike's.

It's such a cruel world where something you love so dearly is so far away! This was my first Earl of Sandwich experience and no other sandwich will ever come close of being as awesome and amazing as this sandwich.

Once everyone around us got their food, my husband went up to the front and told them we never got our food. He explained there was a problem and put our order in again. We ended up waiting just as long as we would if the line was at its usual length so whatever. Definitely worth it and I would never miss an Earl sandwich while in Vegas.",

You get the best of both worlds with 2 types of meat and 2 types of cheese. Bread is toasted to a nice crisp and the cheese melts into your mouth as you bite into roast beef and turkey.    Missing the holidays? No worries, you can get their holiday turkey sandwich all year long! Great sandwich, cranberry sauce gave the right amount of sweetness. Also can't go wrong with the chipotle chicken avocado sandwich. Their chipotle sauce is creamy and adding bacon to it made it even more delicious!   One of the best sandwich places I've been too!",

Food in Vegas on the strip tends to be a little overpriced, so it was refreshing to find somewhere where the prices were reasonable.  They make some unique sandwiches and I ended up getting the \"Holiday Turkey\", which is basically your thanksgiving turkey meal stuffed in a sandwich, complete with stuffing, gravy, and cranberry sauce!  Sandwich was nice and toasty, loved the flavors. A great sandwich!  It was enough to satisfy my hunger without feeling like I overspent.  I'll be back next time!",

I always get the holiday sandwich. Turkey cranberry sauce mayo stuffing all the works. I actually add Brie cheese to it because they have it for a special and it melts great on the Sammy.  I don't appreciate the manager yelling at the employee for ringing in the wrong cheese button. There wasn't a Brie cheese button so the cashier charged me for cheddar and the manager yelled at her. Wasn't her fault there wasn't a button. The manager goes \"do you not know how expensive Brie is over other cheeses\"  Take your scolding and management to the back so guests don't see it!  Again great spot for quick grab and go food :)",

Look just to note I love exploring for new food options. This is irregular for me. The holiday turkey was the best one I tried.  The service was amazing however with the nature of the location, seating was a bit cramped but it was understandable. I the location absolutely has plenty of seating, there is just also plenty of people to occupy those seats. Also the price range is more than fair for the quality and I couldn't recommend this place any more!   Look forward to the day I can visit again and enjoy another tasty Earl of Sandwich, sandwich.",

After running in comfortable and minimalist running flats for the past 2 months, I have no idea how us wimminz survived on Vegas dance floors for 4+ hours. Oh, right, dancing under the influence, dancing impaired, or whatever you called it? \"I can't feel my face when I'm with you\" followed by \"I can't feel my feet/legs when I'm drinking too\".  And then we make our walk of shame out from the taxi line to Planet Hollywood (see, no one EVER thinks about the cabbie), and trek to Earl's to finish off the night. Some of us have our shoes still intact, and other are hobbling in sandals or sans shoes (walk of shame, I tell you!) and keeping our fingers crossed that the line won't be like the line for a ride at Disneyland without the coveted fastpass. Well I'll be damned, the line was short and it's a sign that we must eat here. We. Must. MEAT. Here.  Toasted Tuna Salad Sandwich on Wheat Bread, best combination evarrrrr. Berry chicken salad is pretty tasty too, especially when substituting the balsamic vinaigrette dressing for the peanut dressing 'cause we ain't basic. The sandwiches are NOT the best sandwiches you will ever MEAT. They're excellent for carbloading after a long night, dipped in the scrumptious tomato bisque soup. Prices are cheap for Vegas, and pretty filling too. Yea, we all know why you're here, and it's NOT for gourmet sandwiches. A bit overrated, but I think the hype lies in availability and consistency.  Shoutout to the employees for still helping us with smiles on their faces even at 4am and not judging us. Or maybe they are, because they've all been there. We've all been there. We're still there. And we just can't help ourselves.  MEATWICHES.",

This one definitely stood out to me from all of the other chipotle chicken sandwiches that I have consumed in my lifetime - it was fresh, flavorful, and served on a deliciously toasted bread.

I had heard good things about it from friends, and had read lots of great Yelp reviews, so I was exciting to give it a try this past weekend when visiting Las Vegas.    My initial impression of the food was not good.  I was let down by the fact that my bread was pretty badly burnt on one side.  I had taken my food to go, and did not make the discovery of my bread being burnt until I got back to my room.  However, even with the sandwich being burnt, it was still decent.  Besides being burnt, the flavor of the other ingredients really stood out.  I had ordered the 'The Original', which is a roast beef sandwich with cheddar cheese and horseradish sauce.  After feeling like I missed out on something good, I decided to go back to the Earl of Sandwich the next day to give it another shot.  I ordered the same sandwich again, and it was so much better with the bread being slightly toasted.  I also got a potato salad, and liked that as well.  Overall, it was a very tasty meal.  It is so hard to judge a place based off of one experience, and I am so glad that I went back to give the Earl of Sandwich another try.  My second meal was awesome, and I will definitely go back the next time I am in Las Vegas.",

I went there with my kids bc the good yelp reviews, but I couldn't be more disappointed!    The main thing that bothered me was the smell.  I'm not a smoker, so it was very hard to sit in a smoke permeated place to enjoy my sandwich.  There seems to be a lot of smokers in this area on that day and no one seemed to be bothered by that.    Secondly, their sandwich tasted average, nothing caught my fancy.  Maybe we ordered the wrong ones, I had the Earl's Club, the kids had  the tuna melt and meatball, we finished our meal as fast as we could before we were out of the breath.  So unless i'm happen to be in the area, I wouldn't trek on the hot pavement to come back during the daytime.  Third, it's too busy. Had to wait in line for a while to get the sandwiches.  It's centrally located,  so I reckon the location and price could be part of the reasons for it's popularity.",

THE ORIGINAL 1762: Freshly Roasted Beef, Cheddar Cheese + Creamy Horseradish Sauce   <a href=\"http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/DkYS3arLOhA8si5uUEmHOw?select=RF2G1GIdQBuowR5CXppVkA\">yelp.com/biz_photos/DkYS...</a>  If it's called the original + it's the first thing on the menu, it's gotta be pretty good, right? And it was! ... I don't even like horseradish actually, but this sandwich was amazingly good. And yes, it was consumed not once but twice while somewhat relatively sober + so I know for sure that this sandwich is legitimately delicious with its thinly sliced moist meat, melty cheese... But what really makes the sandwiches here pop is actually the bread; a good sturdy roll that's toasted on the outside + soft on the inside but it's too thick that steals the show from the flavorful goods inside but rather complements them.   Other perks to this place are that it's right on The Strip inside the Planet Hollywood hotel so you don't have to venture off to find a decent cheap meal + additionally, that it's located literally just yards from The Strip entrance at front of the hotel / the Miracle Mile shops. <a href=\"http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/DkYS3arLOhA8si5uUEmHOw?select=KT9yRyjLmgbbmm72dBq3dQ\">yelp.com/biz_photos/DkYS...</a> As someone who despises winding around for miles through casinos due to all the secondhand smoke, this location was the perfect pitstop for us + I'd imagine for any drunkies wandering The Strip as well since it's open 24 hours.   Don't be afraid of the line out front <a href=\"http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/DkYS3arLOhA8si5uUEmHOw?select=LjjLhCDPTnzkt5g1NmRQGA\">yelp.com/biz_photos/DkYS...</a>; it moves fairly fast + gives you time to deliberate over their multiple good-looking options. A couple of my friends tried The Full Montagu <a href=\"http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/DkYS3arLOhA8si5uUEmHOw?select=RX13gt95IhW9qnsPNwYN4Q\">yelp.com/biz_photos/DkYS...</a> + The Earl's Club as well + said they were really good as well. The sandwiches are about maybe 8\" long + they're cut in 1/2 so it's perfect to share when you need sustenance but don't want to be full. They come wrapped tight + in a little plastic bag so it's easy to take to-go or to eat in their dine-in seating area.   Doesn't get too much better than this any time of day or night when you're looking for legit cheap, good food on The Strip in Vegas. Yea, it's just a sandwich shop so take this review into context, but it's a pretty damn good shop. For sure I'll be back.... + maybe to try one of their yummy-looking Ghirardelli chocolate brownies by the register, mmm...   =)  Menu board of Hot Sandwiches: <a href=\"http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/DkYS3arLOhA8si5uUEmHOw?select=6G1HKUGrpTw6A3UG_3HkHw\">yelp.com/biz_photos/DkYS...</a>",

Not for EBC, not the guestlist line for Marquee that really only takes like 10 minutes, and definitely not the 2+ hrs line for Marquee general admission. But when we get to Earls and the line is so long that sections are cordoned off, we wait. That should tell you something about Earls.  I've tried the Full Montague, the Italian, the Earl's Club, and the tomato soup. I've had Earl's fully sober and when I'm so drunk I can barely stay awake and walk but I somehow make it to Earl's. Everything I've tried has been good-- nicely toasted on soft fluffy bread.   And for those of you who just spent a fortune on cover/drinks/gambling, the sandwiches are only about $6!",

When I heard they had put one in the Miracle Mile shops, I couldn't wait to try it again!  We went this past Sunday night at 2:30 (ish) am and had it takeout in our rooms in bed, breakfast in bed style. I had The Full Montagu and my boyfriend had the Cannonballs (meatball). It was just as good as I remembered.  Their sandwiches are simple, but that is what makes them so good. And at least with the warm sandwiches, they are amazing at making the bread crispy on the outside but gooey on the inside.     Earl is also pretty affordable, which is nice since Vegas can get a tad pricy. I highly recommend it for lunch, dinner, and late night!",

    "text": "I feel like the last kid on the block to finally get a pair of the hottest high-tops (or should I say trying out the much talked about Earl).  We were passing back through Vegas on our epic weekend in Utah, and we decided to spend a night in Vegas (believe me it was hard to leave the next day) the only request I had besides hitting up a buffet and laying out at the pool with a drink is to stop at Earl's and have a sandwich.  With that in mind, we all planned to hit this place up for lunch the next day!   Earl is easy to locate, half in the PH casino/half in the miracle mile mall.  We arrived about 1:00ish and there was a small line, it moved fast which was good. Trying to decide on what to order became a picked as fast as possible which is never an option for me since I saw four sandwiches that interested me!  Their menu has plenty to pick from along with salads and wraps.  Going on the more \"healthy\" route I picked a wrap, now which one to choose from (oh the choices).  A tiny part of me really wished they could have made the jerk chicken sandwich into a wrap, but they pretty much only can make salads into wraps (boo)!   The cashiers are fast yet friendly. If you have a question, they are more than happy to answer it for you!  It was our turn and I placed my order:  The Earl's Cobb Wrap-grilled chicken, smoked bacon, Swiss and sharp cheddar cheese, Roma tomatoes, cucumber, cranberries and Buttermilk Ranch Dressing.  I opted not to have the swiss cheese (not a fan).   Tossed in some BBQ kettle chips and I was good to go, Minh grabbed our number, and a drink and we were off to find a table.   Did not take us too long to find a place for the four of us to sit at. Getting our sandwich and wrap did not take too long either.  Before I knew it, I had my much-awaited wrap sitting in front of me bagging to be open. I have to admit that i  had a \"Willy Wonka\" moment peeling back the golden paper.   Sitting inside the golden paper was a delicious wrap filled with all the goodies; I could not take it anymore. I had to take a bite or two.   Bite one... wow this is scrumdiddlyumptious! but oh no my chicken and lettuce fell out the back end of my wrap, the bf was super sweet to stop eating to go and get me a fork so I could eat what fell out.   Bite two... I loved the cranberries in the wrap; it gave it a subtle sweet kick. The ranch was prefect in the amount they gave you.  And yes, there was plenty of chicken, cheese, and bacon with every bite!  The chips are good too, not to greasy but more of a lighter taste with a whole lot of flavor and crunch!  I left not feeling overly full, but just the right amount of being satisfied!   Cannot wait until their new location in Anaheim opens! It will be Earltastic!!!",

The turkey, bacon, cheese and veggies were all delicious and were packed in perfect proportions in the sandwich.

    "text": "I don't understand how a simple sandwich could vary in taste so much at places you go.   I bought a Cannonball!, one of the hot sandwiches. It is basically, Meatballs, marinara, mozzarella, and Parmesan cheese. My friends got the Best BLT, Caribbean Jerk Chicken, and others. We all thought ours was pretty good. Obviously not the best sandwich we've ever tasted, but a step up from subway, quiznos, etc. And for $5.99, not bad at all especially on the strip! I am a real critic of bacon since i love it, and I have to say... that bacon on my friends BLT made me almost regret getting the Cannonball (even though it was delicious). It was crispy, yet not overcooked nor dry. And the bread is so simple, but it makes it taste damn good. I also got the frozen lemonade for $1.99. Best thing is that I can actually drink some of it without having to wait 30 minutes to melt. It was still frozen and slushy, but got about half way until i had to wait for the rest to melt/use a spoon. Oh wells, makes a good thing last longer.   We were there at around 11am on a Sunday though and were still able to find a table that seated 6 people (with a couple other empty tables), so seating wasn't bad.   Good prices, good food, good location, fast service. And I didn't even have to be drunk to enjoy it! Best thing is that afterwards, you can shop, go out to the strip, or go for a round of gambling.",

But I think this chain originated from the original family where the word \"Sandwich\" gets its name...so, you know it has to be a good sandwich.  Every time I go to Vegas, I make at least one stop here.  I usually get their original and have them add tomato on it. The bread and roast beef are very good and tasty.  I have been going here for about 3 years now and never tire from the taste. If you want a light meal and are tired of the buffets, you should stop here when in LV. And this place is now 24 hours so that's a BIG plus for me!",

Although the tuna melt was delicious i just didnt think it was worth the 6bucks just b/c it wasnt amazing in my opinion and for size was a lil much. even though yes it is a bargain for food on the strip...and 3bucks for barely a cup of soup? gees...and there was hardly any chicken in this soup...but! it did taste good, i just wouldnt get it again. the people there are rude or seem just tired out...im sure theyre sick of tourists but cmon now if im saying \"hello and thank you\" to you when you never said either of those to me first...yeah sthings wrong there.  another day later during this same recent trip to vegas, my bf and i went clubbing at tao..and of course i was one...drunk, two- tired as fuck, three- hungry...so we had to resort to earl's since it is in our hotel and its open @2am. these two black chicks in front of us came back from clubbing as well (and i know this b/c when we girls are carrying our heels and walking around barefooted..its from clubbin')..the cashier was flirting with them and i was getting annoyed bc i was fucking tired, drunk & hungry...and here is this dude with his mini dreadlocks tryna spit game while myself and the line wrapping around the corner are tryna get our food! poor guy didnt get a 2nd look nor their #'s haha. so when we were finally next, we ordered one jerk chicken sandwich and a cup of chicken noodle soup. i know why did i order soup again? because for me it cures some of my drunkyness for an hr haha. plus i also wanted to see if another of their soup could redeem itself. jerk chicken was ok, wasnt amazing like some people had mentioned..i would say the red peppers helped that sandwich's ass out in making it taste at least good. soup was better than the tortilla soup surprisingly.  not saying its not worth the try, just dont expect so much from it :]",

And way better on both my wallet and waist. Easy to say that nothing comes cheap in Vegas except for those lovely free drinks. But good food is hard on your wallet and even harder to find. Since I was staying at Planet Hollywood Westgate, I have actually been at Earl's a total of 5 times for this trip. And each time had me wishing that they would add some more veggies to my bad vodka soaked diet. The bread was sooo DELICIOUS but full of butter and grease. I found out that you can actually ask for veggies or extras in it without a charge! I wish I knew that earlier!! :( But nonetheless it is a pretty good deal for being in Vegas and the portions are not TOO bad. If you're a girl you will be full off of $7 and for a guy.. well it sucks to be you in Vegas anyhow :(",

Hubby and I hit up Earl twice on our visit for midnight snacks and both times we were beyond satisfied. The sandwiches are a decent size - one plus a side will definitely be enough to tide you over throughout the night.  If I remember correctly (those hangovers don't come outta nowhere people!), we had the Italian, BLT and the Full Montagu (over a two night period) and I believe the Italian was my favorite. I really like the potato salad here too.  The line does go fast... seriously. And once you order, it's only minutes till your chow is ready to go.   I'd give an extra point if they had cold sandwiches. Sorry, that's just how I like 'em. Otherwise this is a solid spot for a late night snack.",

My mouth and tummy have enjoyed The Earl's Club, Hawaiian BBQ, Best BLT, Caribbean Jerk, their holiday one Turkey Cranberry (OMG BOMB.COM), and their newest one Chipotle Chicken(this one is really really good, mainly because it has avocado!). I also usually add a side of potato salad or mac salad, i prefer the potato salad, It's delish! I've also had the tomato soup back in December when it warms up your tummy on those cold winter days in Vegas. I have never tried the salads or wraps, but they look good too. I think the better value is in the sandwich.  The prices are incredibly affordable which is why there is almost always a line. Affordable and delicious? How good can it get?

All the other sandwiches deserve a shout out just as much as the Holiday, but I'm sure they have been described many times by many people so I'll just stick with one.  Do I need to get into details about the mac and cheese and potato salad? They were both fantastic! Definitely worth ordering again, and again.....and again.

I would prefer Quizno's anytime before this. I do enjoy hot sandwiches over cold ones so they got that. I think a lot of the crazy reviews for this place are from tourists from small towns that maybe that can only compare it to Subway or Jimmy John's. If you are in Vegas take a cab and go to Capriotti's or Pop's.",

I took full advantage of the late hours. I never knew about Earl of Sandwich until I visited Vegas. I ordered a variety of sandwiches off the menu doing my stay in Las Vegas(breakfast & lunch). I enjoyed every sandwich I ate at EOS. Cheap, fast, and delicious is a combination you can't beat on the LV strip. Earl of Sandwich was crowded during certain hours of the day and night. A couple of times, I had very long waits to get my sandwiches. Earl of Sandwich is good bang for your buck. If you're looking for a quality cheap sandwich in Vegas, Earl of Sandwich is a great choice. Note: Earl of Sandwich is a good choice for after the club eats. I give Earl of Sandwich a 4.5 rating.",

    "text": "Sandwiches hot or cold, you'll definitely love this place. Only thing is the wait so be prepared to wait a while here. Most I've waited was about 30 mins. Reason why there's a wait because this place is that good if you enjoy a quick eat instead of going to the Spice Market Buffet which is also good. Even with the long wait, you won't have that of a hard time to find a table because place is on the go; they order, eat and leave so by the time your order is ready, a table should be ready for you as well. Or the other option is to have another person reserve the seat while you order or vice versa. I haven't had much time waiting for my order after I've ordered and paid but I've seen other customers wait a while for their order either because of the confusion from the employees or just way too many people here. Plenty of employees working here so not sure why some people have to wait so long for their order to show up. You'll notice also that sometimes they take orders in waves. First batch orders and then they'll wait a while before they take the next person's order in a way to not make the place too crowded.   I've tried most of their sandwiches here. Highlights for me are their Holiday Turkey, Full Montagu, Chipotle Chicken Avocado and their Hawaiian BBQ. I also recommend getting their Tomato Soup - one of the best I've had. Not too salty and they fill it up with small pieces of bread. You won't be disappointed with their sandwiches here.",

It was a hot sandwich on some delicious bread and I want more.  Too bad there is not one of these in Atlanta.  I would be all over it (I love me some soup and a good sandwich).    Anyway, these people have their service down.  It was seamless and quick.  My only tiny complaint is that the areas where you get your fountain drink is a little small and congested and needs more room, but that's a small thing to a giant.    The table next to me had some mac and cheese and I wanted to ask for some, but didn't because that just wouldn't have been proper.  Boy did it look cheesy and good.  I meant to go back to Earl and get some of that, but you know how Vegas has a way of usurping good intentions.    Anyway,5 stars for great sandwiches!",

The sandwiches are GREAT and delicious. I never remember what I order (sorry!) either I'm too hungry or too drunk to remember, or maybe it's not that great of a sandwich to remember? After all these years I don't think I would ever find out. Haha. The prices are decent. However, one annoying thing I need to point out is that during EDC weekend the lines were... about 30min to 45min long! I honestly don't think its worth to stay in that long of a line for this joint. I recommend going to Pink's a few doors down, NO LINE for bomb hot dogs. But I will come back here on my other Vegas trips during non busy weekends!  I must admit that service is pretty fast. Once you order you'll get your sandwich in less than 10 minutes. They have those buzzer things to remind you when your order is ready.",

We checked reviews before going so we were expecting something good, at least better than Quiznos, which it is not. I am guessing that people like it because it is a cheap option compared to other prices on the strip. But for my money, Quznos is better. Even Subway. Jersey Mike's leaves this place in the dust.   I got the jerk chicken sandwich and not only was the sandwich small, and I mean really, really small, but there was hardly any chicken and although tender, it was not jerk. I also got chicken noodle soup and for $3.49 the tiny little container was a total ripoff. Plus, the soup was bland bland bland. It was by far the worst chicken soup I have ever had. I left no less hungry than when I arrived.   The wife opted for oatmeal, and it was instant from a package. The only saving grace was the banana nut muffin, which appeared to be homemade.  The entire ordering process is chaotic and confusing. You can order some things at the order station but most of our order had to picked up along the line, which led to massive confusion when it came time to pay, so I ended up with three receipts.   Overall, I cannot imagine how anyone can go above 3 stars for this place. I could give it 3 because of the muffin, but in reality my sandwich and soup were 2 star quality and the overall experience was not pleasant.  Would not return for anything.",

The service was decent there, not too friendly but not a buncha douchebags either. i just wanted a sandwich, they just wanted to kill the line, we found a common ground.  the price was decent (don't expect too cheap in vegas anyways) and it got out fairly quickly. maybe due to the fact that i was admiring the line of beautiful girls that came a few minutes after us.  now as for the food, the sandwich was amazing. the bread was soft and warm, and the sweet cranberry sauce completed the stuffing and finished off with the turkey. i felt bad for not saying much to my friends cause i was too occupied eating my sandwich.   i inhaled my food and found an excuse to get back in line and talk to those gir--- i mean, order another sandwich (which was the italian one)  great food, i wish they had one back in SJ. i definitely know to say wassup to my boy earl when i get back to Vegas.",

    "text": "i have had Earl's sandwiches at all hours of the day...  in all sorts of different states of mind. and regardless of whatever I'm feeling at that moment, the sandwiches never fail to send me to taste bud heaven. depending on your state, the size of the sandwich satisfies any type of craving possible. It could be the perfect portion (late night drunk munchies status), or even way too much (sober lunch/dinner, when you are thinking logically and decide not to stuff yourself by saving the other half for late night snackage). prices are super reasonable (about $6 per sandwich), and the selection is huge!  the eating area is located at the edge of the casino area. it's far enough so that customers can avoid the smell of smoke and loud cheers, but it is also close enough so you are able to keep a watchful (and rather entertained) eye on your belligerent friends who insist on playing poker drunk. (or vice versa... both ways work :D)  no matter the distance the hotel happens to be to PH, i ALWAYS make a trip to Earl's. definitely worth it!",

It's located in Planet Hollywood, so if I go shopping and then cry because I'm too broke to spend luxurious amounts of money on food, I come here.  Delicious sandwiches! I can never go to Subway again. When I come back to California, I get depressed if I see a Subway.  Their sandwiches are so fresh and amazing. They have so many interesting choices like caribbean jerk chicken! From the times I went, each sandwich has not failed to disappoint. The Montague is always a safe but yummy choice if you're not feeling too experimental.  Very cheap sandwiches that are delicious! Again, if you want something delicious to eat for a small price, definitely come here.  5 stars! Simple, cheap and delicious.",

    "text": "For all the sandwich enthusiasts out there, this is a MUST when in Vegas!  Earl of Sandwich. You are a god. seriously. So back in December (i know, this post took much too long to actually write) I went to Vegas with some friends and had one of the most amazing weekends EVER. but really, what happens in Vegas, stays in Vegas. HOWEVER, I am a strong believer that the statement does not apply to foods.  Now, upon the rave reviews I have heard from friends I encouraged the group I went with to try out this Sandwich shop. It's inside Planet Hollywood among a ton of stores and etc. The atmosphere is just very relaxed (either that or we were all too hungover to notice much. lol).  perfect location since my friends and I were staying at the Monte Carlo. And best of all, SLOT MACHINES right next to Earl's. What's not to love?  Now upon reaching this fine establishment, there was a very very long line. seriously. I was so doubtful about whether or not I actually wanted to wait in line. But I stuck it out anyways which I'm glad I did because MAN does that line go fast. Now, the sandwich isn't cheap. Mind you it costs $6.99 a sandwich but I had to try it. Plus, I was in Vegas, might as well.  I wanted to go with the basic because I am a True believer that if you can't make a basic sandwich taste amazing, then you're not a very good sandwich shop. So I ordered the classic Earl's Club without the tomato. Within minutes, it was done and i was down to chow. And chow chow chow I did. Oh my god. seriously. One bite was all it took for me to swoon. A warm soft cheesy sandwich. Perfect amount of roasted turkey, smoked bacon, aged swiss, lettuce & sandwich sauce. and my GOD! the bread they used was so soft but not so soft so that the sandwich falls apart. I downed half the sandwich down in seconds. It was THAT good.  Now I know i know. I can be totally biased since I only got the club sandwich but my friend ordered the very festive holiday sandwich that had cranberries in it (don't remember the actual name since i didn't order it). Now i'm usually not a big fan of having cranberries in my food. Something about a pang of sudden cranberry makes me kinda twinge. But my man Earl has proved me wrong. Even that sandwich was amazing. I took a few bites out of it just to try it out. I wanted to gobble that up as well (obviously I didn't considering it was my sandwich).",

Long story short good sandwiches, good price, good location, hours and accessibility.  Service: They do their job, they do it efficiently. Nothing sticks out to me negatively or positively. \"They are who we thought they were\"  Food: Delicious as advertised. I've had just about every sandwich to a point where I know which sandwich I want to go with my mood/the situation. I will say I wasn't a fan of the Hawaiian BBQ, it tasted like pineapple and bbq without really meshing together well. It could have been a one off situation because I was losing that day, but all other sandwiches were great to me.  Price: very reasonable pricing especially with all the other restaurants around it. Probably explains the lines!   Location: Close to the tables to take a break, easy to find, not stuck in the corner of the miracle mile.  A Vegas trip isn't complete without an Earl's Sandwich. Even if I was miles away gambling at M, I would find someone to make the Trek down to PH to get me a sandwich, Diddy Making the Band Cheesecake style.",

I ordered: The Full Montagu: Mustard sometimes makes or breaks a sandwich for me, I didn't make it this time, but was alright.  Italian: Really good, I just wish it came with some greens.  Caribbean Jerk Chicken: Can't describe the flavors, but it worked out right. Ice cream sandwich: The brownie was really rich.  Im glad to say an Earls of sammy is going to be in disneyland!",

Well, maybe my opinion is skewed because I got a breakfast sandwich, which was not great at all.  The saving grace?  It was RIGHT next to our room and it was priced very very fairly.    Food: I got the Bacon, egg, and Swiss breakfast sandwich.   It was early in the morning and we had all been drinking. The sandwich came out PIPING hot. I thought that I was going to bite into it and be struck with inspiration to go and do something with my life.  All I got was a mediocre \"ehhhh\".  I mean don't get me wrong, would I go out and get it again?  Yup, since it's so convenient.  I like my bacon crispy.  It wasn't crispy.  I guess I just had unreal expectations from yelp reviews.    Price:  This probably earned the 3 stars rather than the 2 stars.  I think that it was VERY VERY reasonable.  After losing 90 bucks the night before, the last thing I wanted to do was shell out another 12 bucks for a breakfast sandwich.    CONCLUSION:  I guess I'll just go and try it again.  I think I might go and get an actual regular sandwich next time, since that's what everyone is saying is good.",

I've been once the past 3 times i've visited Las Vegas and have never once been disappointed with the food. My most favorite is the Italian sandwich because it's pressed and the cheese is all melty and delicious, but the bread is never hard or chewy like most versions of toasted/pressed sandwiches i've had. The prices are great for the quality and it's a fantastic option if you're trying to stay within a reasonable budget! There are a lot of options also for sides of soup and salad and they even have wraps. When most of Vegas takes advantage of the tourism by hiking prices way beyond reason, this place is a reliable and delicious alternative to the skyrocketed prices of hotel sit-down cuisine.",

    "text": "So.. The Earl of Sandwich is a real person (well technically 'was') and yes he did invent the sandwich. According to legend, he was an avid poker player, and he would not allow the simple inconvenience of hunger stop him from playing cards. Thus, he ordered the chef to put a steak between to pieces of bread so he could hold it with one hand, and his cards in the other... the sandwich was born.   Jus wanted to throw out that random piece of trivia...  So one my favorite food is of courses sandwiches, and this fact gets me very excited whenever I go to check out a sandwich I haven't been to.  I had heard of Earl of Sandwich before, and seen it a few times on Food Network and I finally got the chance to check out the one at PH. Yay it was fun! They serve up these golden bricks of pure deliciousness. Every sandwich they have is warm and toasted. Waaay better than Quiznos so don't even compare...  The only things that keeps me from giving them a stellar 5 star review is the fact that the sandwiches seem kind of small, I could easily eat 2 of them. At about $7-8 per sammich, I do expect more. On top of that, expect a crowded dining experience. There is usually a line (which moves quick) but it can be tough to find a spot to sit down and actually eat. The place is open 24hours and the fact that their fountain drinks actually have some odd choices is reason to celebrate.  If you like sammiches, and your on the strip, czzzech dis place outttt.",

There was a long line for this place so that's always a good sign that there is something good about it. I was wrong.  Ordered The Earl's Club, Full Montegu, and Thai wrap.  The crust of the bread on both sandwiches were way too hard. It got to the point where I wanted to just dunk it in water to soften it up. It also felt like they skimped on the meat and veggies. The sandwiches were just not satisfying at all.  There was barely any chicken in the Thai wrap. Like two pieces? Felt like I was just eating a veggie wrap.   Maybe it was just a bad order or just an off day...but seriously, I'd rather go to Subway and get a 5$ foot long.",

At first I didn't believe it but when I went, I couldn't stay away.   Although there is ALWAYS a line, it moves pretty quickly.  Waiting for your order doesn't take that long, especially when you're with a group of friends.  The first time I went, I ordered a Caprese wrap.  It was good enough to fill my stomach and fulfill my taste buds for something healthy.   The second time I went, I ordered their tomato soup with a BLT.  Although the BLT had a lot of bacon in it (Sorry, not a bacon fan) their soup was amazing!  Their prices are fairly reasonable, so if you're looking for a quick bite grab some friends and see why they're called the best sandwich place!",

There are plenty of more places to check out but if you're looking for a quick bite than this is the place to stop at.   We ordered the Earl sandwich and added avocado.

    "text": "What fascinates my boyfriend the most about this is that it seems to be owned by descendants of the actual Earl of Sandwich, meaning that they, of all people, should know sandwiches. This always leads me to question how hard it really is to stick meat in bread and eat it... I mean, could humanity really have gone that long before coming up with such an idea? Or is it that this guy, Earl of Sandwich, just proclaimed it first?   Anyway, I digress...  The kicker here is the bread- baked fresh and run through an oven with the toppings so that a crusty exterior and gooey interior can create magic in your first bite.   I can always go for more meat and cheese in any sandwich, but for the very fair price of $5.99 per sandwich, I'm not complaining. So far, I've sampled the Full Montagu (#1 for me), the Original (#1 also for me, it's a tie), the club (#3 for me), the italian (#4 for me) and the hawaiian (#5, but this will fall quickly as I sample the others- the sauce is too sweet for me).   If you ever get the chance, order a salad. The croutons kick serious ass.   The lines can get long, but the staff runs through it quickly. You order from the sandwich/salad/wrap/soup menu first and are given a buzzer. From there you walk through a gauntlet of temptation- parfaits, potato salad, coleslaw, beer and wine, and a wall of desserts- before you reach the cashier and pay for your meal and anything you picked up on the way. When you hot food is ready, you're buzzed. I usually don't sit in my seat for more than three minutes before I get the buzzer of joy.   During my second visit, one register was down so the line was slow moving, but that actually caused my sandwich to be ready right when I paid- not so bad in the end!",

Usually there is a long line but they have an efficient way of handling their orders so it moves quickly. First, you tell the worker what you want, then move down to the register and tell the cashier what you ordered. Sandwich gets made pretty quickly after.   So this is a good place to go if you need a quick bite and you're hungry. However, do not expect the best tasting sandwich.  Ordered the Reuben and there was barely any meat and it was extremely thin. Not enough sour kraut either and the bread was nothing to write home about. It felt oily and heavy too despite the sandwich not having much content.   So unfortunately this is one of those occasions where the food did not meet the hype. But it's cheap and quick and at least it's a step above McDonald's.",

We had just arrived and decided that we needed a quick meal before really jumping into the Vegas fun.

    "text": "Definitely a must when visiting Vegas! You really can't go wrong with Earl. It's cheap ($6-7 for any sandwich), open 24/7, and there are lots of options to choose from. My favorites are the holiday turkey (it's Thanksgiving in a sandwich!) and the Original 1762.  The bread makes all the difference! It is perfectly toasted. At the other Earl locations, you can choose from white or wheat bread, but at the Vegas location, they only have white available (probably to speed up the ordering process since lines can get long).  As many others have said, it's perfect for lunch, after a drunken night out, or a quick snack. If you're especially hungry, you might want to order two. The lines can get a little long sometimes, but it's totally worth it.",

I also ordered a frozen lemonade for something refreshing and non-alcoholic.   Breaking it down:  - The Original was super yummy - the roast beef was really tender and the horseradish sauce wasn't overwhelming. - I'm a big fan of the Earl's Club - everything tasted really fresh! - Frozen lemonade was huge and refreshing. At one point it was so sour that it started to cut up my tongue though. :X  Delish.",

For a 24 hour spot and price, I think this place is pretty good compared to the other places along the strip.  * Avoid prime lunch and dinner hours of 12-1 and 5-6 if possible, unless you like waiting in long lines.  * Open 24 hours.  NICE!  * Carribean Jerk Chicken, Original 1762 and Tuna melt were deelish.  Crispy bread and just the right amount of filling.  Not too greasy.  Not too salty.

I wish I could go back and have another sandwich right now, but for sure the next time I'm having the munchies after the clubs in Vegas, I will be going to Earl's because it's open 24 hours! woohoo! Kinda wish I had read the reviews on what to order first, but I just went with what I was feeling at the moment, which was something not too crazy salty/heavy and I stuck with the Earl Club. Loved it! Your basic club sandwich, but with a chipotle-y sauce and bread that's so soft, warm, yet slightly crunchy that it makes me want to cry. Their bread is amazing! I don't know how they do it, but it reminds me of Mendocino Farm's bread where it looks like the roof of your mouth is going to get some torture scraping against the tops of the bread (which I hate!!), but noooo....surprisingly it's super soft and good!  I also ordered the tomato soup, which I think might have been perfect for sharing because after half a sandwich, finishing the soup wasn't that easy--especially since it's hearty, creamy, and has crunchy bread croutons in it. I'm not usually a tomato soup person, but this really hit the spot.  Also thumbs up on the prices. Not gonna break your bank for being a major hot spot in Vegas. Love it!",

I rarely give out 5-stars but honestly, it bedazzles me that a 24-hour place can also have high quality (where I'm from in SD, quality of food usually isn't found in 24-hour places).  Bread is very fresh (toasted to a perfect amount, not too much, slightly crunchy but not really with soft parts). I got the albacore tuna which tasted amazing, and although usually not a fan of cheese, their swiss cheese somehow managed to satisfy me. I definitely recommend this one. I also tried all my friends' such as the original, all American, and meatball. All of them were so unique but tasty in a very different way. Out of the many times I came here, I was having a hard time ordering towards the end because I enjoyed everything.  Not only that, it's cheaper than the usual sandwich joins (subway). This is the obvious place to stop if you're craving food in Vegas late at night (or whenever really). Line can get pretty long at times but it is seriously worth the wait. I don't blame them for being so popular.   Why can't we have this kind of place everywhere??",

Located inside Planet Hollywood's shopping mall, I wasn't surprised to see a long line, but it moved quickly. The first thing I notice was the prepacked sandwich rolls stacked up in the prep area. I guess the key to a good sandwich isn't fresh bread because my toasted sandwich was damn good! I had \"The Earls Club\" which consisted of turkey, smoked bacon, Swiss cheese, lettuce and tomatoes. For $5.99 it's not a bad price in Vegas! I grabbed a small side of potato salad and a brownie cream sandwich for dessert. The potato salad was good, but nothing amazing. The Brownie sandwich ($2.49) will add an inch to your waist just looking at it. It was good if you like sinfully rich desserts, but I'd recommend splitting it with a few people.   It's hard to rate a sandwich franchise. Do I compare it to other sandwich franchises or an independent big city deli? I'm undecided between 4 & 5 stars, so I'll be nice and give'em a 5.",

    "text": "Okay, so it's just a freaking sandwich.  I know people say that it's over rated and well yeah, it is a bit over rated but it doesn't warrant the 1 star review.  Actually, there's no need for me to even write a review because this place has at least a few thousand.  So why did I give 5 stars?  Because look at where you're at.  Vegas is like a giant airport where the food is jacked up to 60% of the actual retail price.  I bought a slice of pizza and a coke one time somewhere and had to pay 12 bucks. Yeah, 12 motherfucking bones.  So let me tell you that Earl of Sandwich earns the 5 stars because for a pretty delicious fuckin sando, you only pay 6 dollars in a land where they would usually charge 12.  So there's my blurb right there.  Line is pretty long, but it goes by fast and you rarely wait more than 5 minutes to get your order.  Not only that, the process of ordering to paying to getting your sandwich is so streamlined and smooth- there's no kinks to the process which is why they can go through so many people so fast. I ordered the tuna melt and it was decent- I really like their bread and the portions were good.  A half would have satisfied me but I went ahead and ate the other half because I'm to lazy to carry it around with me.    Overall - not the best sandwiches in the world, but they're still GOOD and you get the most bang for your buck here.  Plus, the joint is open 24 hours.",

    "text": "You have no idea how badly I wish there was an Earl of Sandwich location closer to where I live.  These sandwiches are wildly delicious. And, it is an awesome choice to save half of the sandwich for later on in the evening, when you're returning home, drunk and starving, from the clubs. Plus, I believe this location is open all the time. But, of course it is -- it's in Nevada.  The only thing that made me sad about Earl of Sandwich was that I waited in the huge, long line through Planet Hollywood, dreaming of the Italian sandwich I was about to eat (made with salami, capicola, roasted ham, mortadella, mozzarella, tomato and Italian dressing), only to discover that they were out of these ingredients and couldn't make me one. At the last minute, I went with the plain and simple ham 'n swiss ($6.99).  I wasn't sad for long, though, because the service was very efficient, and the sandwich was amazing. The ham was warm, the cheese was melty, and the bread was crisp and hearty. The ham 'n swiss is simple but so, so effective.  I fantasize often about just driving the 32 miles to Downtown Disney in Anaheim solely to reunite with Earl of Sandwich.",

Their Italian sandwich is amazing, i suggest adding roasted red peppers and banana peppers if you're the type that likes a tang to ur italian sandwiches.    Their bread is ALWAYS so damn fresh!  The lines are always soooo long, it hurts when ur starving.  Their baked potato soup is just okay but the Mac n Cheese was delicious!    Expect to be a hawk for seats if you plan on eating there.  If you stay at the hotel, just take it up to ur room and pretend u ordered a $18 sandwich from room service, cuz it definitely tastes like one.",

With prices at $6 a sandwich and 15+ choices to choose from, all of which are priced the same, you can't complain! OK, I get it, Subway has $5 footlongs, but EOS is top notch. First of all, the bread... the bread, bread, bread... it is soooo amazing: soft with a lil crunch and a whole lotta mmm, mmm!  If you're a newb, start with the original! In fact, the original IS my favorite!  Last time I was in Vegas, I brought home 10 sandwiches back home for friends and family to try, and after sitting in the car for 4 hours... it still tasted amazing!   CONCLUSION: Eat it! Whether you're sober, buzzed, drunk, or because you just want to eat, EAT ITTTTTTT!",

With a lot of the restaurants closed, we found that Earls was the only decent food place still opened. Ordering the food was a quick process and seating was plentiful. I shared an Original 1762 which consists of roasted beef, cheddar cheese and horseradish sauce except without the horseradish and got myself some frozen lemonade. I think there was a reason for the horseradish...without it--the sandwich was a little too dry for me. I suppose I could have put some mayo but my brain was not functioning as well at 2 am.  The bread though was delicious! The lemonade though was very concentrated--very sweet and very tart.   If you're looking to be frugal, treat yourself to Earls and skip Subways. I wouldn't recommend the frozen lemonade. It wasn't pricey for Vegas standards, but a little too pricey for what you get.",

I hear there's one at downtown Disney in Orange County now. Be prepared for a longgg line if you are here on the weekend, no matter what time you stop by. At least the Gigantic Star Wars/WOF slots and the PH sportsbook next to the line will keep you entertained. Pretty sure even the off-duty Vegas escorts come here to dine regularly as well.

All their sandwiches are 6\" subs that are cut in half, filled with their meats, toasted, and then topped with veggies.  Coming from Texas, they are similar to which-wich or potbelly's, but with less options.  I went with the club sandwich which consisted of turkey, bacon, lettuce, and tomato.  The sandwich was bland and did not have much flavor.  I didn't even notice that there was bacon in my sandwich.   I guess I have just been spoiled by similar businesses that are located in other states.  The big advantage of this place is that it is located in an excellent location on the strip, is open 24 hours a day, and the prices are reasonable considering where it is located.",

I heard about this place via yelp and my friend highly suggest we go there at least twice during our trip. She was right!   Their bread, meats, and sauce were well made and had just the right flavor to compliment each other in the right way. You could see the club-goers standing in line after their night of dancing, waiting in line to sink their teeth into one of these well made sandwiches.   I wish there were more locations of Earl of Sandwich, so that others can truly know what a great sandwich tastes like.",

    "text": "Best Sandwiches in the world and i am not kidding! Too bad they only have a few locations throughout the USA but who cares! ITS THE BEST IN THE WORLD! I eat at Earl's at least 3 times every vegas trip!  I Will begin reviewing each sandwich shortly...  Carribean Jerk Chicken Sandwich: My personal favorite on the menu! I love the banana peppers and the right amount of spicyness of this sandwich. I even add Tabasco Sauce to kick it up a little bit! This is a must have if you have never been to Earl before.  MY PERSONAL FAVORITE!  Italian Sandwich: Italian sandwiches are great wherever you go but this certainly is one of the best sandwiches on the menu. Make sure you eat it right away while its hot and order the delicious salt n vinegar chips to go along with it!  Tuna Sandwich: One of the simplest sandwiches on the menu with it having only 2 ingredients on the inside, Albacore tuna and swiss cheese.  The bread is of course what makes this sandwich but every sandwich is served hot and this hot tuna sandwich was SUPERB!  The Original: If you're into Horse Raddish and Roast Beef this is awesome! I also love the earl's spicy mustard they put to add some kick to it!  Earl's frozen Lemonade:  EXCELLENT! Just like the frozen lemonade you buy at disneyland. Cheap too!  Caprese Sandwich: If you've ever been to italy or just had mozarella and tomato Caprese or just enjoy something without meat, this sandwich does the trick. Too bad they dont make this smaller, because it would be a great appetizer.  Kono Coffee: Not bad, I prefer walking to Coffee Bean inside miracle mile!",

I stood in line at the counter and I ordered the turkey sandwich and boy.....was it the best turkey sandwich I've ever tasted!!! I just sat there happy as a lark!

All things good: Its cheap, the line moves amazingly fast, the food is absolutely delicious, you aren't standing out in 100+ degree weather and you get to people watch as you eat!  Pretty much come here to eat for breakfast, lunch and dinner if my friends don't drag me off to some other restaurant. I like to eat other peoples food so I'm almost sure I've tried over half the sandwiches, wraps, salads, soups etc at Earls.. and everything is FANTASTIC. The soups are perfect when you're hungover and don't remember what being sober feels like. My go-to from Earl's is the Caprese sandwich, always ALWAYS hits the spot.   Even when I'm nauseous from a full night of drinking, I somehow manage to find my way to Earl's.",

There is usually a line and sometimes seating can be a challenge, but thats only because its busy. The cost isn't bad at all for a place on the strip (go to Pinks outside and you will pay more for a Hotdog)  It isn't a culinary masterpiece rather a good sandwich wrapped in a nice warm roll. I would also suggest adding a brownie to your meal as they are very good. All in all, its better then Subway, cheaper then Pinks and a hell of a lot of fun watching the drunks stumble through the casino.",

During my drunk tasting, I ordered The Earl's Club (Roasted Turkey, Smoked Bacon, Aged Swiss Cheese, Lettuce, Roma Tomatoes & Sandwich Sauce). It was good enough to fill my hungry tummy but I never felt the crave to go back. I didn't even know this place was such a \"big deal.\"  Second time, I stopped by after a long drive from LA2LV. I ordered a Chinese Chicken Salad (Grilled Chicken, Field Greens & Romaine, Chinese Mix, Crispy Wontons & Fresh Soy Ginger Dressing).  The salad was decent...average. Ladies--only order this if you need to fit into your dress for the night's festivities! I wouldn't order the salad again if not for that!  I also had a couple bites of my friend's Hawaiian BBQ sandwich (Grilled Chicken, Roasted Ham, Hawaiian BBQ Sauce, Aged Swiss Cheese & Fresh Pineapple). It was better than my salad for sure but not special enough for me to want to come back.  Maybe third time's a charm? =/",

I get the chipotle chicken avocado in recent times but I used to get the full montague or earl's club. What the sandwich is made up of is on the menu. For soup, I usually get chicken noodle but the soup varies depending on time of day. There are multiple soups to choose from, which is a good thing if you are not into chicken noodle. Also, sometimes there are long waits depending on the time, which is the only down side to the place. They sorta expanded the area due to the amount of customers they get. Great place for hot sandwiches! Enjoy!",

Overall, I'd look this place up no matter where I'd be staying in Vegas next time.  * On my way to my room to eat, the hooker that popped out from behind a bank of slot machines offering me a massage in my room, although not affiliated with the restaurant, was a nice touch.

I highly recommend the tuna melt which is absolutely yummy. The prices are reasonable too for a pretty big sandwich and what's more is that these are made fresh and so you'll always get a warm sandwich.  You might have to wait a bit depending on when you come and how many other people are also hungrily stumbling out of the clubs or casinos but it's such a much better option than trying to go to an expensive (and usually crappy) 24 hour restaurant on the strip.",

Pretty cheap sandwiches for a place that's on the strip.  Their wraps and salads are okay.  But the sandwiches are the ones to get.  The turkey one with the cranberry sauce is my fave.  Two thumbs up!",

The sandwich was a good size-- about the size of a large Quizno's sub. The meat inside the sandwich was tasty-- especially the rolls of ham. They overwhelmed my sandwich with their Hawaiian BBQ sauce. They put about 2 tiny slices of pineapple in my sandwich-- not enough given the generous portions of ham.   For the price, it's a good sandwich. I was disappointed in the execution but it had good ingredients. If you're looking for something gourmet, turn somewhere else.",

I know it's popular in Vegas and I will probably try it again with something else when at PH.",

Man the bread was so good it was crispy on the outside and nice and soft on the inside. Everything one would expect in a delicious sando. Definitely visit this place- you can't go wrong with any of their sandwiches, both my boyfriends and mine were really amazing! The salads looked a little package-y and not so fresh but I didn't have that I went for sandos and chips and those were super YUM",

Soon we end up giving it a try, and we are both very satisfied.  I was so amazed how great the hot sandwich it tasted and it's only $5.99 before tax. Their drinks - include hot coffee, hot tea and fountain drinks - are reasonably priced at $1.99. We ordered a Cannonball and an all American, a bag of chips, two drinks, and that's all less than $20! Wow, was I on the strip?!  The all American sandwich is made of turkey with a special blend of cranberry sauce and buttermilk ranch. It brought up a nice and sweet taste that I could never forget. Its bread was warm, flat and specially made, making the whole sandwich tastes so outstanding.   Eating on the strip could be expensive, but this store would be one of my cheap food choices without sacrificing tastes.",

    "text": "THE BEST SANDWICH!  There is something about the combination of  all the meats with cheese in between these two decadent pieces of bread heat up to the right temperature that makes these sandwiches irresistible!    Think of the typical sandwich and then double that experience then triple it and then drop it like its HOT!   I've tried everything on the menu, but my all time favorite is the italian, I like my sandwiches on the salty/savory side and this one takes the cake!  First timers should try the original but my advice is to try any specials they have going on, usually around certain holidays.  Recently they had the Chipotle Chicken Avocado, and it was DELICIOUS, I was going to order my usual italian until I saw this little hot thing in the corner, just sitting there advertising itself and I had to get it!  But overall I think if I had to pin point something that makes THIS particular earl stand out, it is the BREAD, it has a nice texture to it, not too soft and not too over toasted, it was just right...not quite a crunch but more of a crisp-ness to it.  In addition to its price ($6), its open 24 hours so after the clubs or a late night snack, this is a place to be!",

Service: just like any other sandwich place such as subway, or quiznos you order and you pick up.  Food: Oh my... where do I start... I've had earls everyday during my 3 day stay in vegas. Well worth the price you pay, you can see your food toasted and bubbling on the conveyor belt and steaming hot. The bread is one of the major things that makes this sandwich shop golden. You also get one of those buzzers while waiting for your sandwich so you don't have to stand inside the shop when it gets crowded.   Overall: Yes yes yes! This is a must go to in vegas! Personal recommendation is the Earl Club!",

It was good but nothing special and nothing I'd write home about.  When I first saw this place, it reminded me of Quiznos cause they use the exact same sandwich toasting machine.

The salad wasn't bad, the cheese was fresh and it had a good taste overall, but compared to the ones we make at home it wasn't bad.  The club was great, it had a smoky taste to it that I really liked.  My girlfriend had the Italian which was amazing.  Great blend of flavors and it was exactly what she was looking for.

The good ol Earl might just be the best thing that has ever happened to Planet Hollywood and for 24 hours a day, seven days a week it feeds many appetites for non-Strip prices.  For those not in the know, Earl of Sandwich is a chain. Not a Nevada only chain like some others were lead to believe, but a national one. It doesn't carry the name of a Quizno's or Subway's, only its way better and until LV gets an place that is local and convenient, it seems the rest will be flocking here and adding to the already silly lines that occur randomly throughout the week.  My sandwich of choice is the Full Montagu, a beautiful concoction of turkey, roast beef, lettuce, cheddar and swiss cheeses, tomatoes, and Earl's mustard. It's a classic choice, perhaps their most popular one, and it is delicious any time - whether its hungry and sober or hungover and blacked out. A fun combination is the Turkey Holiday (aka the Thanksgiving dinner), which features turkey, cranberry sauce, stuffing, and gravy. There are a multitude of sandwiches that fit every palate, every craving, and thankfully are between $5-8 each. This is considered a great deal on the Strip.  If you can stomach the lines and the sometimes impatient service, Earl of Sandwich is a rite of passage for many late night hungry folks on the strip. This is a way better alternative than shooting for the standard casino diner / cafe and worth the few bucks for a shot at sandwich glory.",

I should be the Duke by now..but ain't nobody got time for checking in when you're in Vegas  This is the best spot to eat anytime and theyre open 24/7 too. Every sandwich is good, reasonably priced and despite always being busy they're quick to have your food ready.  I personally like the Earls Club or something along the Italian deli meat sandwiches so I can put some grey poupon or dip it into my tomato or broccoli soup.   I've had everything except the Holiday Turkey or Vegetarian. I've been meaning to try them but everything else is so good.  7 bucks for a decent sized sandwich or 11 with soup.  Only thing is I wish they would have TR discounts or an express line for us that hold a card with the casino like some other restaurants but oh well..   Can't go wrong here, drunk, sober or on something else..this place always hits the spot.",

Cannot even begin to explain the sensations I felt while consuming this item. The turkey was fresh, moist, and packed a punch of smoky flavor, the stuffing and gravy were amazing, felt just like a holiday meal. That bread tho... so damn fresh, soft, and toasted just right. If I were hallucinating it would've felt like I were biting into toasted clouds. That's how light and fresh the texture of their bread was! My panties were literally getting wet with each and every bite. Don't judge me for giving this casual sandwich spot 5 stars. :P",

Came here because my friend said that it was a good sandwich place, and I really didn't feel like driving too far for food.  All the sandwiches are between $6-$8, and they're damn good.  Got The Full Montagu for $6.95, and that roast beef was some of the tastiest I've ever had ANYWHERE.  Bread was money as hell.  Plus their chicken noodle soup wasn't too bad either, definitely comes in the clutch when you're trying to recover from the club.  Line goes by way fast, and the service is friendly.  Only problem is that it's first-come, first-serve seating.  Because there's usually so many people, it is a bit of a struggle.  But for this place, I'm gonna have to start making a serious exception.",

It moves fast though and it's open late!!! I know there's another chain inside caesars palace.   I've come here so many times at different hours (lunch, dinner, early morning post club) and I never remember what I get BUT I do know that I usually like any sandwich I get. I know I tried the Italian and chipotle chicken so those are safe bets.   Prices are way cheaper than your average Vegas food. They don't have these on the east coast where I live so I come here once during any Vegas trip I make.   Good spot to grab a quick bite with fast lines!",

Two of us got the Chipotle Chicken Avocado (CCA) and our other friend ordered the Grilled Cheese from the kid's menu (she has the tiniest appetite in the world). The CCA was pretty delicious! It comes with bacon, which I'm not a huge fan of, but it provided a nice kick of salt. Not spicy enough for my liking, but the bread is SO GOOD OMG. Perfectly toasted with a nice crunch, but not too hard or chewy! My friend also really liked her Grilled Cheese. Its tiny, served on a small round bun with two kinds of cheeses.  This location is speedy, you order and get a buzzer and they buzz you when it's ready to be picked up. Seating is a free for all, but we didn't have any problems finding a table.",

In a few minutes, the buzzer went off and we picked up our sandwiches.    The sandwich was good.  There was a lot of bacon, the egg was good, but I didn't taste cheddar.

Although in most of the cases if I am here, I am probably drunk and hungry.    Pros:  -24 hours, thankfully.   -great service, I hope everyone is nice to the people that work here.  It's 3 am, and they have to deal with drunks at an ungodly hour. -delicious sandwiches!  My personal favorites: chicken chipotle, tuna melt and the full montague just to name some. -coleslaw!!  I absolutely love their coleslaw! -their wraps are actually really good too!  Yay for variety!!  Cons: -longggggg lines, depending on what time you go, it moves relatively quickly but still.  No one likes waiting in line, although if you come with a few friends you guys can take turns testing your luck in the slots or tables. -philly cheese steak is not that good, wouldn't really call it a philly cheese steak, way too plain.  By the way, this is the only sandwich I tried that wasn't good! -limited seating  All right, this is not a gourmet sandwich place so do not come in expecting to be waited on hand and foot.  It is a fast, casual place catering to the drunk Vegas masses.  I give it 5 stars because Earls holds a special place in my heart because it reminds me of how much fun I used to have in this exhausting city.  The food is good too, don't get me wrong, I will always love the Las Vegas, original Earls.  Disneyland Earls can suck it!",

You know something is going to be good when it is wrapped in gold foil. It is like golden bricks of deliciousness.  Anyways, onto the food.  The Original: Looks pretty plain, but packs in a lot of flavor with their super tender and juicy roast beef paired with their horseradish. Add some poupon mustard and it is perfect.  Full Montagu: This one has all the fixings inside, and definitely a must try.  The Club is also very good, quite similar to the Montagu.  Why I love their sandwiches:  +Tender, and juicy meats. +Their toasted bread is amazing +Perfect amount of spread +I love roast beef, and their roast beef was the best I've ever had in a sandwich.  Portion wise is on the smaller side so if you are hungry you might want to order two....or three....maybe if you are like me and really love their sandwiches you could get four.",

The sandwiches are great but I do not recommend ordering any cookies, brownies, or muffins. Since they have been sitting out and they are always old and hard. I guess they baked them somewhere else, package them and send them to the restaurant. Other than that I love that they used the electronic square paging system. So when it buzz you know that your order is ready. :) The price is not bad either it is just as much as eating at Quiznos , that is if I am comparing it to another sandwich chain.",

    "text": "Very solid sandwich offerings. $5.99 for an 8\" sandwich is probably the best deal you can get for something of this quality and caliber on the Strip. True, there was a long line just to get your order in, but they're like Portos Bakery - huge line, but fast turnover. Not 3 minutes after I placed my order, I got my sandwich.  My buddy and I split a Jamaican Jerk and a Thanksgiving Turkey sandwich. The bread is pretty ridiculously good. It's toasted and crispy on the outer layer, while soft and cushy in the middle.. like pillows for my teeth and tongue to enjoy.   The Jamaican Jerk had a slight sourness to it with the peppercinnis, but was very flavorful [especially with the bacon]. The Turkey sandwich had stuffing, cranberry sauce, and turkey. I wish this sandwich were piping hot, because that would have propelled this to a perfect sandwich. Alas, it was not piping hot, and alas, it is not a perfect sandwich. But a pretty darned good one still.  Make sure you have someone in your party sit down and reserve a table while you go and stand in line to order. We did that and was guaranteed seating.  The perk of this place being open 24/7 is quite amazeballs. A quality and substantial offering at all hours of the day can't really be topped. They don't go buckwild crazy and stuff your sandwich to the max, but they certainly aren't shy with how much they give you either. It's a very well packed sandwich that gives you just the right amount of everything for you to enjoy to the max.  I will definitely visit Earl of Sandwich every time I visit Vegas. Definitely worth the visit.",

Being in Vegas, things are rather pricy and when your appetite awakes whether it's in the middle of the afternoon or late after a night of partying, it's so nice to be able to go to Earl's to get a warm and tasty sandwich without having to pay for an arm and leg.  Tried the Original 1792 sandwich, which consisted of roast beef and cheese.  It was great!    You must try their sandwiches whenever you get a chance to visit them (within Planet Hollywood hotel & Miracle Mile) and judge for yourself.",

I'd for sure go back!   one thing to know is that they have a pretty good selection of sandwiches but there's only one size and one type of bread, unless you get a wrap, next time i wanna try their creamy tomato soup with croutons. good option if ur up late or leaving the club.",

I take a bite; the cheese is so smooth, the bread is soft, and the tuna is delicious. Man! I loved the sandwich so much! I was so sad when it was gone. I am definitely coming back.

They had a decent size menu with a variety of choices.  The price was very affordable at $5.99 for a hot sandwich or wrap.  Their service can be improved because the cashier was definitely not helpful. But at least the food came out fast and fresh.   Hawaiian BBQ: If you like ham and pineapple this is definitely a top choice.  The bread was perfectly toasted like a panini and the BBQ flavor was sweet and flavorful.    The Full Montagu: Roasted beef, turkey, Swiss and cheddar cheese, lettuce, Roma tomato, and Earl's mustard. This one tasted like a classic sandwich.  It was hot, fresh, and of great quality.  It wasn't greasy, but delicious.  However, it doesn't have the unique flavors of the Hawaiian BBQ.  Overall: Probably the cheapest, yummiest, and most convenient food spots in Vegas!",

We landed in Vegas and walked over cause we wanted a quick bite to eat and the Earl did not disappoint. We ordered the Italian and the Hawaiian BBQ, both without cheese. We got our sandwiches in about 8 minutes and they were excellent. Even my husband, who does not like pineapple in this food usually, ate half my sandwich.   A few days later, we picked up some sandwiches to take with us to the Hoover Dam. I ordered the Italian (no cheese thanks to my lactose intolerant husband) and he ordered the Caribbean Jerk Chicken. Even after sitting in its wrapper and in the car for 2 hours, the sandwiches were still great.   Now Earl of Sandwiches, please open in the Detroit area.",

We were staying off the strip this trip, but at my mom's insistence, made a special visit to Planet Hollywood just to get Earl of Sandwich. The Caribbean Jerk Chicken is great - slightly spicy and tangy, but my favorite is still the seasonal holiday which is like Thanksgiving in a sandwich.   Yes there will be a line, possibly quite long, but don't be discouraged. It will move quickly and soon you will have your grubby fingers all over a delicious toasty sandwich. FYI there's a location opening up in Downtown Disney too, so now LA/OC-ers can get their sandwich fix without going all the way to Vegas.",

We stayed at the Aria this past weekend and our only option was the Aria Cafe, which was open 24 hours but was a bit on the pricier end. We decided to take the tram over to the Bellagio and walk to PH to dig into Earl of Sandwich, which is also open 24 hours.   Sandwiches will run you about $6.45 here. They're made-to-order, so they're toasty and warm. Plus, the bread is out of this world and the sandwich is a great fix at basically any time of the day. The lines move pretty fast, also.   I opted to get the Original (which is basically what I get every time), and it doesn't disappoint. Use the horseradish/grey poupon sauce on the table for a little kick.   Thanks for a fast, delicious, and cheap option... and for being open when everything else isn't!",

You gotta love places that accommodate the late night partiers, the gamblers, and the night owls!  You will find Earl's as you enter Planet Hollywood from the strip entrance.  Be prepared for the line as it is ALWAYS busy, but the staff members keep the line moving efficiently so you'll get your sandwich in no time!  Sandwich prices are around $5ish - $8 ish so it is affordable if you have lost all of your money gambling :)  However, best sandwich I've ever had?  Not quite...but I like that the sandwiches come out hot and it does the job for a quick bite to eat.  I'll probably find my way back here again the next time I'm in Vegas :)",

We came around brunch time...like 11 and it was pretty much empty.  You order your food at the first register and then make your way down to the second register where you will be paying. Along the way, you can grab drinks and other goodies such as chips, cookies and so on.  I HIGHLY recommend the earl's club. It is absolutely perfect everytime I get it. The bread is to die for and it is just the right amount of food for a great price.  My boyfriend and I also shared the Chipotle Chicken Avocado. It was really good as well, but i'll stick to the earl's club next time. He also got the cannonball for himself and LOVED it!  We brought our friends here with us as well. It was their first time and they absolutely loved it. We spent $52 for 5 sandwiches, chips, and 4 drinks.   Highly recommend checking this place out. Never disappoints!",

The last time we went I got the chipotle chicken sandwich and it was the best one I've ever had there. I also got the broccoli soup and it was creamy and delicious. Their desserts are also quite delightful...cakes, muffins, etc Yum! My husband got the Original 1762 sandwich and he really enjoyed it. The Earl's Cub is even better according to him. I really think it's their warm and fluffy breads and tangy sauces that put them a notch above most other sandwich places. You can tell all of the ingredients are fresh, so I don't mind paying 7ish dollars for a sandwich that IS smaller than a Togo's sandwich in comparison.   I am not orgasmic over this place like my best friends are, but it's a cheaper lunch option in Vegas if you want to pass over the typical buffet, and the food is really fresh and high quality for a sandwich shop.   I'm sure we'll return.",

Once we got to the front we ordered the original and chipotle chicken sandwiches, along with a cup of their amazing tomato soup.  We waited about another 5-10 minutes before a staff member handed us our bag. We saw right away that there were 3 sandwiches (not 2) and we were missing the soup. How could they mix that up? We showed the staff our receipt and they gave us the soup.  When we got back to the Cosmo to eat, we found that they had given us 2 of the originals (they basically made one of our sandwiches twice). Sweet deal..  The roast beef on the original was extremely chewy though, and I had to spit out a lot of the meat. The 4 star review is really for the soup and the chipotle chicken sandwich which were amazing. Beware of tough roast beef!",

The wait is less than 5 minutes for your sub to come out.  I still have few more to try but I'm pretty sure all their sandwiches are good. I esp like their bread! Hot and crunchy.   - Hawaiian BBQ: Grilled Chicken, Roasted Ham, Hawaiian BBQ Sauce, Aged Swiss Cheese & Fresh Pineapple (got this off the list). Anything that has \"BBQ\" in it is good. I like it cause it wasn't too salty like the holiday sub. The pineapple was good! It didn't taste so much like bbq but it was sweet.  - The Earl's Club: Roasted Turkey, Smoked Bacon, Aged Swiss Cheese, Lettuce, Roma Tomatoes & Sandwich Sauce. This one actually had veggies in it so that's a plus!  - Holiday Turkey Sandwich: I just remember turkey and cranberry sauce inside. I thought it was a bit salty so the cranberry kinda even it out but it was just okie.",

Not a big sandwich but filling because of all the chicken and bacon (I'd say it was about 7 inches). The bacon was all in one clump and very chewy, but I enjoy chewy rather than crispy bacon. I don't know if I'd recommend this one, I'd probably try a different one if I'm ever here again.  Definitely not a memorable or high quality sandwich but $7 for a filling and hot sandwich you can get literally a couple feet away from the slot machines? Priceless.",

A little too much sauce. We ordered the The Thai wrap but asked to put the Thai chili peanut sauce on the side. When eating it, it was still very sweet & loaded with sauce, so returned for another ..  just order sauces on the side to be safe as where they were leaking down out of the wraps...  still great customer service",

Other then that, I am soooo grossed out right now . I am going to be making some phone calls.",

The bread was just so good, soft and fluffy... the cheese was so silky and gooey. My recommendation is the mozzarella and tomato sandwich. I took out the tomato and added avocado for a dollar, so yummy. You can make it a combo for $3 and add chips and a drink. No exaggeration one of the best sandwiches I've ever had and I'm not saying that because it was 4am.  Staff is so awesome, the night crew was so funny and corky. They also have a huge seating area ! I find it super cool that your sandwich comes wrapped in gold aluminum foil.  BY THE WAY: Check your sandwich before you go back to your hotel if you don't eat it there, they left my avocado out the second time!",

    "text": "The earl of sandwich is a classic in vegas. If you are looking for a great lunch or trying to recover from the night before, the earl is always there. This is a high quality sandwich that features excellent ingredients with fresh deli meats and artisan bread.   The classic is a great place to start which features roast beef and horseradish.   The full Montigu is my personal favorite which has roast beef and turkey.   I had their salt and vinegar chips which were not my favorite S&V chips because they lack a vinegar flavor.   The tomato soup is excellent. It is creamy without tasting overly creamy and has a taste of fresh tomatoes without an added sugar flavor. I recommend getting the croutons on the side otherwise they will likely be soggy by the time that you are eating.   Even if the line looks long, they will likely be able to get to you rather quickly. They are very efficient behind the counter.",

So I ordered a French dip no onions of course came with cheese and Au Ju! So good!The bread was pretty thick but toasted so good and held up to that sauce and meat! Lots of flavors going on here.   So the best part of my time spent here was the brownie! Oh yes! I said brownie they make a few sweet treats that you can buy. I had a triple chocolate brownie that was so moist and so chocolatey goodness. I would total come back just for that alone. You did good Earl! I appreciate you! Yum Yum!",

It doesn't happen often for sure, but the Earl is also the Duke..but not the Duke of Earl. That's a song right? HA!  Well, you need to expect and..., there's a reason there is always somewhat of a line 24/7(remember, this is Vegas, ok?). Busy. Killin' it more than any Starbucks even. Well, maybe not.. debatable.  I know I can honestly say I love every sandwich I've tried here! To be consistently impressed over expectations on 6-7 visits is no question awesome. Fresh bread always, and delicious! Had at least 5 different sandwiches, tortilla soup, Thai salad. Chicken sandwiches are done perfectly juicy every time. 1762 and Full Montagu, oooh..! I can never save half of them, can't stop eating! All a great value here. You somehow, someway feel a little better than eating burgers or pizza since they are healthier overall. We've tried the one at Harrah's So Cal and it's not on par with this one. They got it cranking here. Has to be the freshness of it all, they never close! Located near one of the entrances near Planet Hollywood and the miracle mile mall right off LV blvd. Walk up some steps. Don't let the line scare you away it moves mighty swiftly! Never more than 15-20 min wait at all. Still quicker than many. Do it, I think you'll like it a lot.",

When you have money to be spending either gambling, drinking or a new LV bag, you should not have to spend your money on expensive food --especially in Vegas.  When it's time to have low key chill - I highly recommend Earl of Sandwich. It's not like a Quiznos or a Subway. It's much better. It is a chain, but it's something you have to try.

I ordered the The Full Montagu (roasted beef, turkey, swiss, cheddar, lettuce, tomato, and mustard sauce) and a bowl of chicken noodle soup. Can't go wrong with that combo. SO delicious. Hot and toasted sub sandwich with juicy flavors that are never forgotten.   The day before, I ordered the chicken tortilla soup, I didn't like it at all. I was expecting more of a chicken noodle soup with crispy tortilla strips but I got what resembled chili.   The reason I sadly put 4 stars is because in the sandwich, the last bite had a black rubbery part of the meat (which was probably the skin or something odd) and that was pretty gross. But that never has happened to me and I've had Earl's for years.   Earl's has my heart.",

Overall it's a good experience but if you really want to know the truth, I wish it was a little bigger since after finishing the sandwich I still can go for another one. The sandwiches are roughly about 6 inches (the size of your palm). We had the Italian & Chicken avocado. Chicken was a bit spicy so don't go for it if you don't like spice.

I'm not a big sandwich person but wanted to try this place. There wasn't much of a line at all, which left little time for me to make a decision before quickly ordering the Full Monty on Wheat. My boyfriend ordered the Holiday Turkey. His was hands down the clear winner!   Based on my sandwich, I would never return. I'm not a huge fan of meat and eating bread is probably the last thing I need to be doing but my boyfriends sandwich selection was definitely the type of sandwich that makes you say hot damn! This is freaken delish! I'd totally order and eat one of those bad boys.  The price is totally right though, for those in Vegas not wanting to spend Vegas lunch prices - here's your place! I personally would rather pay a higher price for a tasty meal.  All in all, it Earl of Sandwich was just ok in my opinion. I don't need to rush back or seek them out here in Anaheim.",

Some may find that it is pricey when ordering a combo (adding chips and a drink) to your sandwich order. But I don't think it's exorbitant at all. You can't really compare this to Subway or Port of Subs or even Capriotti's. It's just different. Honestly, the BEST sandwiches I've ever had was at Earl.",

They have a pretty big menu, ranging from sandwiches, salads, wraps, soups, and even desserts! The prices are pretty good too! About $6 for a hot sandwich!  All of the sandwiches looked and sounded really delicious - well, being hungover and starving, anything sounds good to be honest. Nonetheless, I was torn between The Earl's Club - roasted turkey, smoked bacon, aged Swiss cheese, lettuce, Roma tomatoes, and sandwich sauce - and The Full Montagu - freshly roasted beef, turkey, aged Swiss and sharp cheddar cheese, lettuce, Roma tomatoes, and their savory mustard sauce. My friends, who have been here in the past, told me that I should just get both, eat half of each sandwich and save it for the ride back, so I ended up with both. My friend alone, bought 4 different sandwiches for herself, so I didn't feel that bad for buying two.  No lie, The Full Montagu was amazingggggggg. So fresh! It was the best thing to cure my hangover. Even so, I couldn't even finish the quarter of it. I didn't eat The Earl's Club until the next day, even so, it STILL tasted pretty good.   The only downside is that this place seems to always be crowded. We waited about 20 minutes before we could order. Twenty minutes doesn't seem long, but when you're starving, it seems like foreverrrrrr. I wouldn't want to wait in this line at 4 in the morning after ending my night at the clubs.   Anyways, I'm definitely glad they're opening a location in Downtown Disney. I get to try out more of the sandwiches without having to be in Vegas!",

The line wasn't as bad as we've seen it & the employees do keep it moving.  He & I decided to share a Special of the Day, Chipotle Chicken sandwich & the Caprese sandwich.  The sandwiches aren't as big as the delis I'm used to back home, but they did fill us up.  Both sandwiches were just alright, but the Caprese's refreshingness & simplicity was the better of the two.    What I like is the fresh bread, the fact that it's 24 hours & it's cheap for being on the Strip!  It's a good cheap quick fix for any time of the day.  I wouldn't mind coming back when I need me some carbs on the cheap!",

When you think about it, it's really is just a hot sandwich. Sure, it's delicious, but it's nothing out of the ordinary. I must admit though, it does become the best sandwich ever when you have a bad case of the drunkchies, drunk munchies. It's also awesome that they open 24 hours so they can cure all those with the drunkchies.   I suggest that you eat this as soon as you get it. Otherwise, it will get cold and lose it's signature quality. I'm sure all the sandwiches are tasty, and that it's all in personal preference as to which one you should get. I really like the \"Full Montague.\" From what I remember it's roast beef, tomato, and some white cheese, (can't remember which kind) maybe swiss?  I give it four stars though. Service is great, even though it's mostly self serve. Price is also very reasonable. Sandwiches are about six to eight dollars max. Also, because it's open 24 hours for those who want a hot sandwich at any hour!",

I ordered the Hawaiian BBQ, grilled chicken, roasted Ham, aged Swiss, pineapple & Hawaiian BBQ Sauce. It was sweet and good, the meat was moist and juicy. I could have eaten two of these mmmm yum!  My sweetheart got the The Full Montagu,  roast beef, turkey,  swiss & sharp cheddar, lettuce, roma tomatoes & the Earl's mustard sauce. We each took a bite of each others sandwich and they are both delicious.  We also both ordered a side of potato salad, mmm yum made with the red skin potatoes, was good.   Unlimited fountain drinks, coffee and iced tea as well as hot tea.  We will stop by again if at Planet Hollywood hotel and casino however don't think will make a special trip to dine here like we did today.   I am glad my curiosity has finally been fulfilled :)",

    "text": "I had a craving for omelettes one Saturday morning in Las Vegas, and this was a quick (less than 30 minute wait), affordable (~$10) and relatively convenient (about one mile from our hotel) dine and dash breakfast joint on the strip. Unfortunately, I was hyped up by the reviews and let down by the food.   Do NOT order their veggie omelette! It came looking like a soiled rag that was microwaved in a crescent-moon mold, and tasted like soggy cardboard. To say it was overcooked beyond recognition is an understatement. My roasted potatoes were bland and disappointing as well, only slightly more palatable than the \"eggs\". The only saving grace for this dish was the toasted slice of a bagel and Smucker's grape preserves (the kind that never expires). Save your $7 for a sandwich for their lunch menu!  I also tried a bite of my friend's breakfast sandwich with eggs and bacon. We both thought it was shrug-worthy, equivalent to a glorified egg mc muffin with a couple pieces of pig meat.  The two stars are for satisfying my morning fiber fix. Oatmeal with dried fruit and nuts is available for $2.50!   I guess it was my own fault for trying something less popular (omelette and oatmeal) from a restaurant that is famous for their gourmet sandwiches. Next time I'll follow the herds and get a deli selection!",

It was close to 5am and there was still a long ass line but was glad to see it move along quickly.  Since it was my first visit, I ended up splitting two sandwiches with a friend (original and the hawaiian bbq?   iirc).  Waited for a few mins (seemed like 1/2 hr prolly cuz I was still drunk) before they paged us to pick up the sandwiches (glad there was plenty of eye candy dining in the area!!).  Thought the sandwiches were sooo good that we ended up going back for lunch which was less than 6 hours later.  Wasn't a big fan of the Hawaiian though but it's most likely due to the fact that there was pineapples in the sandwich (it was the one that my buddy ordered).",

Hubs was told must try from friends so I am here again. He ordered the Italian, I the Chipotle Chicken Avocado.  Brought it back to our hotel and found they screwed up my order.  The wrap was labeled correctly but inside was another Italian! What's up with that?  Hubs said to go back and complain.  Not worth it...I ended up eating only half the Sammy as it was kinda salty.  Hubs opinion: \"meh\".  A few days after my initial review, I received a message on Yelp and a follow up email.  Earl's business and guest service team thanked me for the review and apologized for the error.  They offered to make it right.  I really appreciate a company that is customer service and customer satisfaction focused.  Kudos to the Earl Team!  I added 2 stars for their excellent customer focus!

With a one dollar sign on Yelp, I figured it would be cheaper than it was.  The sandwich itself came out to about 7 bucks, but a drink was TWO NINETY-NINE! so one measly fountain drink, and I broke 10 bucks for lunch. OK fine...hope the sandwiches are big...well, they aren't. They aren't small exactly, but they would never be qualified as big.  I finished my sandwich not full, but I made sure to get a refill of my soda to make up for the 3 bucks I spent on it.

A quick drive down the 15 to PH and then the 5-7 minute stroll through mall before reaching my destination, this casino sure is a lot different during the day compared to the late evenings.  I arrive and immediately see what appears to be a really, really long line.  The group in front of me, a party of about six, change their mind and leave.  That works for me!  I'm now closer a little closer to my food.  The line moves very fast, so don't be discouraged.  I just had a simple Ham & Swiss ($10 with chips & a fountain soda) but wow, what a large number of interesting sandwiches they have that I absolutely am going to have to come back and try out.  It was fresh, had a very unique taste and once I finished I found myself scrambling for crumbs wishing I hadn't devoured it so quickly.  For my first visit, I have to say everything went well.  The food was prepared fast.  The place was clean.  Plenty of seating.  World Cup games on the TV screens nearby.  I can't give this one 5 stars (yet) because nothing knocked my socks off, but it was definitely above average.  I'm looking forward to getting back and trying many more of their offerings and with this place being a 24-hour shop, I'm sure I'll be having a few late-night sandwiches quite soon.  This is a definite must for anyone staying in this area who have been subjected to Subway, Quizno's or Port o' Subs over the years.",

    "text": "The Scudetto, my first bite at an Earl of Sandwich.  Delish.  Salami, Capicola, Ham, Mortadella, Mozzarella and Roma Tomato.  I have to say that my initial reaction was that there wasn't much between the bread.  That would be my only negative, is that the amount of meat, cheese and tomato was pretty slim.  However, the \"artisan\" loaf is what makes this sandwich.    You place your order at the first station, slide through the ala carte offerings, such as potato salad and bottled drinks, then get to the cashier where you pay and order a fountain soda, if you want.  They give you a number, you sit down, and then people watch as folks walk through the mall.    The night I was there, the Hawaiian Tropic Zone had its grand 'red carpet' opening, and the Earl of Sandwich was the prime viewing position!  Carmen Electra, The guys from Enterouge, Stacey Keebler (sp), Mario Lopez, some girls from The Hills...it was all a fun night...and for only a few bucks at EOS.",

I tasted the Original Roast Beef sandwich which was warm and gooey, and their cobb salad with chicken, bacon, cubed cheese, and ranch dressing. Both were enjoyable, but the gf said the sandwich was a little on the bland side.  Its nice when you can bring in a 24oz margarita that you bought on the street, sit down and eat a nice hot meal with it, and no one looks at you funny.",

I enjoyed it so much I came back for a second try -  I knew it  could just not be this good  ... but it was, and right in the Planet Hollywood.  I sampled the Tuna melt and the Meatball and found them to be excellent. I tried the club sandwich and it was good - but not as good as the other two.

BUT, it's not the same experience in Vegas (hungover, or after a night of partying and getting wasted). This place has been such a great convenience for my friends, family and I. The quality of their sandwich is amazing, plus it's 24 hours! The line can get long, but personally to me it goes by pretty fast - especially having such a various choice to choose from their menu, I often had times where I couldn't make up my mind on what to get and I would end up getting 2 more orders on the go. It's that good - believe the hype or not, you need to try it yourself. The only bad thing I have to say is that, their Holiday special is by far, the best sandwich I have ever had in my life. Why is that bad? Because they only have it once a year for a limited time. I love Thanksgiving food, and I'm a big fan of stuffing... to have that with a mix of gravey and some cranberry sauce. It's just, \"WOW.\" Words can't describe it - full on foodgasm.",

It was a little hard to find in the Planet Hollywood casino.  We tried the Full Montagu, Thanksgiving Sandwich, Pastrami Ruben and the tomato soup. First of all, the tomato soup. My goodness. Is there anything creamier?! It was mindblowing delicious. Get it!! You won't regret it, it's silky, smooth, creamy and rich. I could eat bowls of that. Our fav sandwich was the Thanksgiving sandwich with turkey, cranberry and yummy stuffing!! Mmmmmm, such a good combo. So savory and sweet. Definitely a great sandwich.

Then you move down to the cashier where you get any additional items (chips, muffins, cookies, boxed salads, etc) and pay. Fountain drinks, coffee, and lemonade are self-serve. There are several tables and bar seating which are typically full since it's a busy location. No outdoor seating since it's in the middle of the casino. Open 24hrs. Breakfast sandwiches before 11AM. Fairly quick service so double check your order because sometimes the order is incorrect.  Our Order: Holiday Turkey: ($6.99) Turkey, cornbread stuffing, turkey gravy, cranberry sauce & mayonnaise Sea Salt & Vinegar Kettle Chips: $1.29 Earl Grey Lemonade: $2.99  BF's 1st time here (and almost the same for me since the last time I had it, I was a little kid & all I remembered was that I didn't care for it to much at the time). Both the BF and I ordered the Holiday Turkey Sandwich. Their own artisan bread was toasted just right and wasn't too dense or dry. The stuffing was flavorful and the kind that's more on the wet side than the dry stuffing that I'm used to. Not too much gravy to make the sandwich soggy (if eaten right away). The cranberry sauce was on the sweet side instead of the tart (which I prefer). The turkey are deli slices so they weren't dry but I would've preferred if they were thicker slices. Overall a good sandwich. Their salt & vinegar kettle chips went well with the sandwiches so I recommend getting a bag. The Earl Grey Lemonade was interesting but didn't have as much early grey flavor as I would've liked. BF didn't like the lemonade even though his tea of choice is Earl Grey.  The Montague and the Original are the popular sandwiches so may try that next time if I'm nearby since they are open 24 hrs.",

    "text": "I absolutely LOVE Earl of Sandwich! This was my first time at this location but the food here never disappoints me! Earl's is located on the strip inside Planet Hollywood Hotel.  There usually is a wait but the line goes by pretty quickly. There is also a seating area where you can seat yourself if open.   Some of my favorites:  Caprese: I tried the Caprese on wheat bread at this location. The flavors were delicious! Mozzarella, Basil, and Tomato with balsamic sauce between warm wheat bread.  I love this sandwich and it is definitely my go-to.  The Full Montague: This is SUCH a classic at Earl's! The flavors between the meat, cheese, and vegetables are amazing and you can always pick from white or wheat bread to go with it.  If you're looking for a hearty sandwich, I highly recommend this sandwich!  Earl's is open 24/7 so get the grubbing on even at late night!",

Open 24 hours  --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------  The sandwiches here are AMAZING whether you're drunk or sober. I don't know how they make it taste so good or it might just be my imagination since I only get a Earl of Sandwich a couple times a year. Either way I highly recommend making a stop here if you're in Las Vegas.  My absolute favorite is the Chicken Avocado sandwich, it's perfectly warm, chewy, and saucy.  The Full Montague is not bad as well if you're not feeling in a chicken mood.  One critique: I wouldn't recommend getting the broccoli cheddar soup, in my opinion it was a bit too salty for my taste.  This place is open 24 hours which makes it a great late-night snack.The line can get pretty long at peak times, but I promise it's worth the wait.",

My current go-to is the Tuna Melt, but the most popular are the Full Montagu and Earl's Club. They also have an excellent soup selection! Most popular is the tomato but I've taken a liking to the chicken tortilla recently. Their salads are also always fresh and worth a try. They've also started making wraps, which I haven't had a chance to try yet.  The line is always long but it passes fast. You order at the register and they give you a receipt and a buzzer (is that what those are called?) for your food. You can then pick up drinks, chips, or other small items, such as fruit cups and parfaits, on the way to the next register, where you give them your receipt and pay. Find a table and when your food is ready, the buzzer will light up and vibrate. Get your food and enjoy!",

I had the original 1762, and my husband had the cannonball sandwich.  I really loved the quality of the roast beef in this sandwich.  It was sliced thin, and nice and rare.  However, there really was no vegetation in the sandwich which I like.  There was not a ton of meat either, but for the price, around 5.99 or so, I suppose it should be expected.  I also had a side salad with it that seemed fresh.  My husband liked his sandwich, I took a bite and wasn't crazy about the flavor of the meatballs.  This is also the first place in town I have seen that has Diet Mountain Dew at the soda fountain.  Considering I hate Diet Pepsi, this was a welcome change.  I would come here again but I would probably ask for lots of veggies on my sandwich.",

We were staying at Planet Hollywood for my birthday weekend, and after a day worth of drinking, walking and going to Thunder from Down Under, we wanted a snack so my friend recommended this place. I didn't really think anything of it because I though, \"Sandwich? Whatever, it's like Subways or Quiznos.\" I was totally wrong. I ordered the Earl club and it was the best sandwich I've ever had! The bread was perfectly toasted, a little crunch on the outside and nice soft and warm on the inside. The cheese was perfectly melted and blended into the meat and the bacon was savory and crunchy! What makes this place even better is it's open 24 hours! So while I was drunken passed out on the floor in my hotel room, my awesome boyfriend got me the American Sub and a brownie for the morning after. Even though it wasn't freshes, it still tasted awesome and the brownie tasted like it was homemade!  OH and the sandwiches are huge! It's more of a meal than a snack in my opinion!  Only downside is that the lines get pretty long and the wait is even longer. When I went with my girls, we waited at least 15 minutes to get our order taken and then another 25 minutes to get our food. However, it was well worth it and I'm not even that big on sandwiches! I would totally recommended this place to anyone who hasn't tried it!",

(=  While the majority of the group opted for Pink's hotdogs, which was right outside the Miracle Mile/PH hotel entrance, a small handful of us decided to grab something slightly lighter by going with sandwiches from Earl (inside PH).  Boy, let me tell ya, NO REGRETS.  The best part of Sandwich connoisseuring is that you get to try out a plethora of tasty breads!  Earl's offers a warm and toasty bread that doesn't flake, but crunches by the bite.  My friend and I had both ordered the signature Earl's Club ( Roasted Turkey, Smoked Bacon, Swiss Cheese, Lettuce, Roma Tomato & Sandwich Sauce) while another fella went with the Veggie sandwich (Feta Cheese, Lettuce, Roma Tomato, Cucumber, Red Onion, Roasted Red Peppers & Mediterranean Dressing.)  Now, I don't know what the sandwich sauce consists of, but it sure did compliment the ingredients with the crunchy bread.  I'm guessing that the sauce is somewhere along the lines of a zangy mustard, a hint of mayo, and a splash of light vinaigrette, perhaps?  If your tummy can make room for a tasty soup, then I would definitely recommend ordering the tomato soup as well!  I shared a cup with my friend and it was delicious!  Tangy and lightly creamy, served with a handful of crunchy croutons, it was the perfect finish to a beautiful sandwich.  What makes me more sad than realizing that I didn't take a single picture of this masterpiece is finding out that Earl of Sandwich cannot be located in CA.  I guess this calls for more visits to Sin City!",

It's the perfect cure to a hangover, at least it was for me, and it's the perfect thing to eat after a night out. I tried their Full Montagu and their Club. I have to say they were yummy in the tummy goodness. It's their bread that makes it so awesome! If I didn't do breakfast at the buffet there, I would've just asked for their bread toasted lol. Also, their desserts are yummy. I was eyeing their sweet cream brownie and was not going to get it cause I'd rather save my calories for my drinking, but my friend got one and I decided to have a piece and it was so yummy that a piece ended up being like half the brownie lol. I will so need to go here every time I'm in town after a night out :P",

They feature a dozen different hot-pressed sandwiches, salads and wraps.   I chose the Full Montagu which had roast beef, turkey, swiss and cheddar cheeses and a spicy mustard. Delicioso! The sandwich alone filled me up, but I did see they had kettle-cooked chips and their own freshly-squeezed lemonade. This definitely hit the spot after a long flight from the east coast.",

It's located in the PH casino and right inside the PBR entrance to Miracle Mile Shops (look for Pink's or PBR). Lines sometime seem long but they move quickly. Ordering is a bit different than other sandwich shops in that you order your sandwiches first, then move down the line gathering sides/beverages and paying at the end. Then you get the vibrating coaster and wait for your sandwich to be ready. Sandwiches are cheap, ~$6 and they are open 24 hours. OPEN 24 HOURS. Remember this.  I ordered the Italian (highly recommended) both times but after reading Yelp! reviews I am excited to try some others on the next trip.   GO THERE. NOW.",

While eating the sandwich, I can't help but feel how light-tasting it was even with the bacon. I took a bite of my friend's Earl Club with the thousand island dressing and it was exceptional as well.

I first discovered Earl of Sandwich when I was at Downtown Disney in Florida a couple years ago and have been a huge fan since. The closest one to me is at Downtown Disney in California so I was excited to hear there was an Earl of Sandwich during my recent Las Vegas trip.   I'm a huge fan of holiday sandwiches and this sets the bar for future holiday sandwiches I will try. It not only comes with the usual turkey and cranberry sauce but also STUFFING. Now that's what I call a holiday sandwich. I was so disappointed when I didn't see the holiday sandwich on the menu when I was at Earl of Sandwich in California only later discovering it's available year round. I'll never make that mistake again!   Anyways, I ordered my usual holiday sandwich again and it didn't disappoint! This is a smaller location than the ones I've been to but the sandwiches are just as yummy! I also got a chocolate chip cookie to go with my meal. It was super chocolate-y and chewy.   There's something for everyone here, from sandwiches, to salads, to wraps. The bread always tastes freshly baked too. Early of Sandwich is definitely living up to their claim of being the \"World's Greatest Hot Sandwich.\"  P.S. Don't forget to order the Earl Gray Lemonade.",

The buzzer tells you when your food is ready. The lines are long but they move quickly. They have an organized system. Every sandwich here is amazing. This is probably the best fast food you`ll ever get at any time of the day, cos it`s open 24/7. Must go there for at least once a month. My favorite sandwich is chicken chipotle with avocado, and I love their crunchy bread.  I highly recommend this place.",

Even if this place has a huge line, it moves fast and efficient. Just don't expect to easily find a place to sit and eat!  The condiments and toasting make the sandwich. They absolutely do. I'm usually not a fan of mixed deli meats in a sandwich, but I will ALWAYS, ALWAYS make an exception for the Full Montagu. The toasted swiss and cheddar cheese give the roast beef and turkey such a rich flavor, and the acidity of the deli mustard just cuts through the heavy flavors and tie the sandwich into a perfect little package.  You can do no wrong with the Original either; roast beef, cheddar, and horseradish sauce. The horseradish doesn't overpower the sandwich and is not too spicy - it just gives the sandwich a necessary kick. So good!  Now, I usually LOVE this place and would gladly give it 5-stars, but my last trip was the first time I've ever been disappointed. The disappointment  was with their new side: Bacon Macaroni and Cheese. Don't get me wrong - the macaroni and cheese itself tasted wonderfully salty, rich, and cheesy. What disappointed me was the bacon part. I expected it would be a macaroni and cheese cooked with diced up bacon or something, but when I opened the container, it was 2 slices of bacon (same bacon from sandwiches) placed on top of the mac and cheese and then toasted. Now, I don't know if bacon was cooked with the macaroni (I didn't see any pieces), but it just seemed kind of a lazy attempt to bacon macaroni and cheese.   But I would definitely go back again.",

Each square was a size of a knuckle mixed in with cranberries, romaine lettuce, roasted chicken, smoked bacon and ranch dressing. This yells M'ehrica.    Few days later before our flight - We battle malnutrition and we stopped by again for fast and good filling food. I had the Medditerranean tuna salad which was awesome. It's pretty much a tuna salad with cucumbers and an extra mediterranean flare of feta cheese, roasted bell pepper, kalamata olives (obviously that's not all) and other things that I can't remember during our vegas trip. jk  Conveniently, Earl is placed to our other tourist stop --The Sugar factory. Don't mind if we do guys. We're here anyway right? So this is another way a girl can get her expensive lollipop action on for dessert -- without driving dates crazy for another tourist-y pitstop.",

We were at MGM and it wasn't a far trek over to Planet Hollywood. I was practically in pajamas still, knowing that everyone else passing by us at this time, probably looked worse anyway cause they would have been coming home from a night of debauchery (and all that lovely things that come with that HAHA).   No line. YES! Got a bacon, egg and cheddar on ciabatta and a coffee.   Man that sammy was hot. Like steamy, burn your tongue hot! But It sure was good. The bacon was crunchy (ok slightly overcooked but it was still grrreeaat), fluffy egg, melty cheese, toasty ciabatta.   Now that's much more appealing to wake up to than that girl who looked hot under strobe lights the night before I'm sure.",

I have tried the tuna, Caribbean jerk, Hawaiian, the Full Montague and the Original. They're all good and I recommend all of them depending on what your preference is will determine which is your favorite, but on my last visit I had the original and it literally knocked my socks off! It's crazy how a sandwich consisting of only roast beef, cheddar and horseradish sauce practically changed my life. For 1 roast beef is my favorite sandwich meat, not to mention the slices Earl's uses is pretty thick. I was surprised because it was almost like they had cut it with a knife, thick enough that you could tell the meat was rare. I also love horseradish sauce, but theirs isn't overpowering the beef/sandwich. The cheddar was very minimal, which is just how I like it since I am not a huge fan of cheese. I will probably be ordering the Original from now on, thank you!   P.S. I prefer the this location (the grand daddy) vs. the Palms one for some reason. As mentioned in another review, there is just something missing at the other one.",

I personally don't think it's unique and amazing that'd i'd wait an hour in line for it. It's located inside Planet Hollywood which is convenient to Aria, Vdara, Cosmo, Planet Hollywood residents since it's nearby.   Honestly, from the prices of things lately, I would consider this place dirt cheap for food, but considering everything edible in Vegas is super cheap, I no longer find it a positive for this place versus others. I think what it has going for it is the 24/7 service and convenience. It's crowded late at night and early in the mornings, so I'd say if you want to go here, definitely go during meal hours because that's when people actually eat real meals.   Tips:  1) Open 24/7 so go whenever you please 2) Try the chipotle chicken avocado 3) Go during meal hours  It's affordable if you are looking for something cheap and not fancy!",

Pros: bread--it's really more like a crunchy ciabatta bread which is super good. Probably the best part of the sandwich. Cons: sandwich size--if you're super hungry and are expecting a large sandwich you will be sorely disappointed. I couldn't believe how small the sandwiches were. They certainly don't pack a lot of ingredients in these sandwiches either. You'll be eating more bread than meat. So if you are quite hungry, I suggest going elsewhere. Would I come back?

I thought the prices were reasonable and the food was dependable.  I was thrilled to see that I could get a Cobb salad and it was pretty good despite being somewhat different from other Cobb salads I've had.  It had no avocado but had cranberries and two types of cheeses which were in chunks in the salad (I actually kinda like the cheesy chunks).  It hit the spot and was good.  My friend had the Cobb salad in a wrap which she also enjoyed.  We were able to order and get food very quickly, and there is a coupon for 10% off in the book you get when you sign up for Planet Hollywood's players' club.  We had no problem finding a table.  The food is served in very handy little carrying bags that you could also take to go to another hotel or back to your room at PH, if so desired.  I would return here if I was nearby.  It's inexpensive and dependable, and it's not a sit-down meal which makes it convenient.  I am not sure I would travel too far to get here but I would go here again if in the area.  I also will add that I should return to actually try a sandwich since that really does seem to be their main thing.",

The bread is what really makes it for me, nice and warm and a little bit crispy. My bf got the Hawaiian BBQ sandwich both times because he said it was so good. I got the meatball sandwich one time and a turkey sandwich with cranberries, lettuce, tomatoes, and some other things (I can't remember what it's called) which I would highly recommend.

I don't mind paying for what you get, but this was getting subway shit.  The sandwich was ok, nothing that great.  The tomato soup was pretty damn close to what comes out of a campbell's can with yesterday's bread as croutons.  The kid's grilled cheese looked like a overcooked whole wheat hamburger bun and it was dry.  Salad was good, totally dug how they put the dressing at the bottom to control the withering.  Potato salad was pretty generic and tasted like it was out of a tub.  Brownies were overbaked and crunchy (if you're into that sort of thing).  Seriously people, check out a Specialties sandwich or a Corner bakery sandwich.  If you thought this place deserved 5 stars, you'll make either of those places, your last meal on earth.",

    "text": "I couldn't understand how a sandwich was so hyped out of all things Las Vegas. Maybe it was the alcohol 5am munchies or exhaustion from the crazy night, but Earl of Sandwich did not disappoint. (The Bellagio brunch buffet did, though, just to give a comparison.) The line was not too bad compared to how it got 30 minutes after my group ordered. That put me in a real good mood since that's pretty much the only thing I lucked out during the entire trip):  Looking at the brick of a sandwich, my first thought was, \"I hope it's not greasy as it looks because I'm about to yak my guts out right now.\" And to my surprise, it was actually very light and exactly what I needed in the wee hours of the morning! The bread is amazing, and both the Caribbean Jerk and Hawaiian BBQ were great sandwiches. The sauces weren't overpowering and I didn't get a greasy residue all over my mouth that I usually end up with from panini-like toasted sandwiches. Next time, I wanna try the more \"normal\" sandwiches. I started to regret not getting the club sandwich (my fave) the next day just because I thought I can find great clubs anywhere :/  It was here, though, these 2 creepers followed our group without saying a single word for the next hour inside Planet Hollywood, and that really freaked us out. Oh, Vegas boo.",

I swear that I eat here at least 2-3 times on every Vegas trip. Why? Maybe I don't have the appetite for a buffet. Maybe I don't want to pay $30 for an average restaurant meal. Maybe I'm running short on time due to other \"priorities\". Where can I get great food without emptying my wallet or waiting endlessly? You guessed it.  It's remarkable how fast the service here is. Whenever I see the long line, I always think that it's going to take forever. Silly me, I should know better after all of my visits. This place uses an assembly line system to crank out sandwiches in record time. If only more places were like this. But what about the taste? No compromise here. The sandwiches are fresh, toasty, and hearty. I would highly recommend the Full Montagu, Earl's Club, and Caribbean Jerk Chicken. The prices are amazing compared to most food items in Vegas. Most sandwiches are under $7! For that price, you might as well get a few and stock up for later.  And while I'm not sure if it's open 24/7, I've never seen this place closed. Let's just say I've been here at some pretty odd hours too. Can't wait to come back!",

    "text": "No Vegas trip is complete without stopping by Planet Hollywood's Earl of Sandwich. It is open 24 hours and totally hits the spot after an alcohol filled night. On my first experience, I was waiting in a long line at 3AM in the morning, I saw this guy sleeping while sitting up with a group of his friends, from my assessment I assumed he was intoxicated. When I saw him eat his sandwich, he consumed with his eyes closed, pretty much sleep-eating. Don't think he ever opened his eyes, but you could tell from his expression that he was in full bliss. When I finally ate my first sandwich, I knew what he felt.   I have tested most of their sandwiches and I have concluded that their best is the Chipotle Chicken Avocado. So bomb that I even order one or two to go, just to eat back at the hotel. The bread that they use is what makes their sandwich amazing. You can see the sandwiches come out of the conveyer belt, freshly toasted to perfection.   The line is usually long but goes by pretty quickly. They even pass out paper menus so you can try to decide what you want by the time you get to the front. They give you those little pager things to let you know when your order is ready. Finding a place to sit can be tricky. Don't be surprised if it's packed at 3AM in the morning.  I even got sandwiches to go for the long ride home back to San Diego. Though they have a location near Disneyland and in Harrahs Rincon, I still prefer to indulge on their sandwich in Vegas, the atmosphere, the environment, and being in the Vegas mentality just adds to the taste.",

It was nice to eat somewhere affordable and not feel like you have to stuff yourself to get your money's worth at a buffet.  Earl of Sandwich gets the job done and serves mouth-watering decent sized sandwiches.  The sandwiches are all perfectly balanced with its different components.  The bread is really fresh and the whole sandwich just melts in your mouth.  It's so warm and gooey--I'm craving for it already just reminiscing about it!  The salads were really good too.  I tried the Mediterranean Caesar Salad and it was really good as well.  Make sure to tell them to go light on the dressing since they tend to put a lot in there.      I also got to try their frozen lemonade which was pretty decent....but what makes it better is if you have extra vodka laying around....say at your room or in your pocket ...or your purse...Just splash some in there and BAM! you have a refreshing cocktail.

I can appreciate it's model, brand, execution and chipotle like concept, but it's not a exceptional deli. I stand behind my bay area favorite (Ike's). In my view this is what Quizno's aspired to be, but could never execute.  I was disappointed by it's portions (too small for my liking). I liked my chicken sandwich, but nothing was memorable.

The Full Montagu was the favorite of everyone's. I've had that and also the Thai Wrap on another occasion. The best part of the sandwich is the bread because it was warm and crispy on the inside. However, there isn't much meat and vegetables for that size of bread. Other than that, the sandwich was quite tasty and the bread, as I mentioned, is the best. For the Thai Wrap, I ordered this because I just needed some Asian flavors after going so many days without it. The wrap was fine and nothing special. There was a bit too much sweet chili sauce and not enough peanut sauce. The ingredients were fresh, and there was a decent amount of filling in the wrap.  The people who work here are super friendly and will kindly answer any questions you may have and offer you suggestions. Overall, this is great place to come to when you need a quick bite to eat, or had a bit too much to drink and need to bread to soak it all up. You'll leave full and satisfied.",

    "text": "I liked it--it was cheap and I went at a time in the AM where there was no wait.  I ordered a breakfast sandwich, the egg, bacon and cheese one.  Sadly, my egg was a little thin and overcooked, my bacon was cut into small diced pieces and mixed in rather than the bacon strips (and stacks of it) that I was expecting, and the cheese was also very conservative.    Overall, my sandwich was dry and definitely not as much bacon as other peoples' photos were.    I was expecting this: <a href=\"/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2Fs3-media3.fl.yelpcdn.com%2Fbphoto%2FbcK75Axd_C6o9qCvSOe-pw%2Fl.jpg&s=6e05d92d170abc91f110f4cc4ac9ab9c7d291052823b1140e47472448a3f35d3\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">s3-media3.fl.yelpcdn.com...</a>  I got this: <a href=\"/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2Fs3-media4.fl.yelpcdn.com%2Fbphoto%2FHWYv7jfMb68LGayNprpx5w%2Fl.jpg&s=be9010bdb15b12ae532f0f532a0c6be41002071e8238070073ce897ea508b82c\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">s3-media4.fl.yelpcdn.com...</a>  What happened :(  I only give it a 3 stars because I'm sure their other sandwiches are great--I will still come (but only when there's no line), and it's a nice relief to find a meal that costs less than $10 in the strip when everyone else is gouging you up the wazoo.  Tip: I went in on a Sunday at 10:00 AM and there was no line.",

    "text": "Located in PH by one of the entrances (ask around if you don't know). YUMMY hot sandwiches! Opens 24/7! Great for anytime of the day.  How to order: Line up, order your hot items, get a buzzer, move down the line, order drinks, pay, find a table, wait for the buzzer to go off, pick up your order, enjoy the food!  Don't shy away from the long line, it moves fast! Since it does move fast, know what you want to order before it's your turn. Most their sandwiches are less than $7 and it's a rather small portioned sandwich. I do get full from one though. Don't even try to share even with the tiniest of appetite. Thank me later when you don't find yourself lining up in the line and waiting for your second order. I recommend the Chipotle chicken Avocado (sweet and tangy) and/or the Full Montagu. Order a drink because you can get refills. Great to drink when you're outside in the hot sun too.  It's a must try when you're in Vegas :)",

I came back and ordered The Original 1762 again (Roast Beef, Cheddar, Horseradish Sauce, $6.99) and it was ok, but needed more horseradish. The roast beef was quite rare so a little chewy/grainy, but I did end up eating it the next day so probably lost some flavor in the re-heating. I'll definitely have to try something new if I end up here again, like the Holiday Turkey or Chipotle Chicken Avocado (they said this their most popular sandwich). There was no line at 6pm on a Saturday.",

Nothing spectacular or worth raving about, it was a normal sandwich. I've definitely had much better ones. The one really good thing was the bread. It was really warm and fresh.  Overall this is good to grab a quick bite without spending a lot of $$. It's still a really small sandwich for $7.56 (including tax) but it does fill you up. I'd probably go here again and try one of the other sandwiches too if I'm around Planet Hollywood.",

If you love thanksgiving dinner, this one is for you.  - The Full Montagu is amazing.

Earl of Sandwich is located inside the Planet Hollywood/Miracle Mile Shopping Center connected to Planet Hollywood Casino. We passed by many times over our couple of days in Las Vegas and it was always packed with a huge line. We had to wait in line for probably 15 minutes to order, and then a few more minutes for the sandwich to be made.   We ended up splitting a Chipotle Chicken Avocado Sandwich. The sandwich was delicious and had a heck of a kick with the spice in the Chipotle sauce. It will clear your sinuses, for sure.   The prices were about the most reasonable we found during our entire trip. The restaurant was clean and the staff were friendly. The menu isn't huge, but everything sounded good. We had a hard time deciding. You should check this place out if you want a great sandwich at a great price. Just be prepared to wait for it.",

Sandwiches are truly bomb - from the perfect combination of fillings to the warm, toasted bread. Also it is quite affordable for Vegas at $6.99 for a decent portion.  Favorite so far is the chipotle chicken. Ugh. I love how they are generous with the avocado, and the slight sweetness of the chipotle sauce with the crunch of the bacon is ON point.   Also tried the holiday turkey and the tuna melt, of which I liked the latter slightly better. Holiday turkey is literally turkey with cranberry sauce and stuffing. Tuna melt is more savory, with a heaping amount of melted cheese.   The tomato soup is also very delicious - super creamy. Be sure to get croutons in it!  I'm gonna try the full montagu and the earl blt before I leave...and maybe a wrap. Lol. When I leave Vegas, I will miss Earl. But I guess what happens in Vegas stays in Vegas...including these amazing sandwiches. I'll just look forward to next time when I return.",

    "text": "Based on what I've personally noticed and read, this is why Earl of Sandwich gets so many rave reviews: It serves good, cheap food 24/7. Stop by for a break after hours at the casino or when you've been out all night. This place is obviously known for their sandwiches, but you could also grab a salad or soup here among other sides. It is located inside the Miracle Mile Shops and is accessible from the casino side of Planet Hollywood.  Full Montagu ($6.99): It's a nicely made toasted sandwich filled with roast beef, turkey, Swiss and cheddar cheese, lettuce, Roma tomatoes, and mustard; I asked for wheat and they made it happen! The ingredients were fresh and packed nicely together; the staff making them were not skimping on the meat or vegetables. Flavor wise, the mustard was particularly strong, slightly overpowering the meats. Outside of that, however, I honestly have no complaints about this sandwich.   The Italian ($6.99): It's filled with salami, capicola, ham, mortadella, mozzarella, Roma tomatoes, Italian seasoning, and Italian dressing. Even with all the different slices of meat, the sandwich was not salty. It was very flavorful and made well.  If you're looking for a snack or some late-night munchies, definitely drop by and buy a couple. The prices are very reasonable and, most importantly, the sandwiches are delicious. Lines go pretty quick, but the sandwiches do take a few minutes to make. You get an order pager while waiting for your order.",

There is nothing fancy or Vegas like about this cafeteria style Sammie spot,  no crazy menu, no neon lights, not even girls in skimpy outfits lol.  Earl of Sandwich does deliver some great tasty Sammies for a cheap $6.99.  We ordered the Tuna Melt which was perfection, light soft crispy bread with gooey Swiss and tuna salad.  I coul eat this Sammie everyday of the week.  We also tried the roast beef Sammie which was named the 1762 or something close to that.  The beef was so tender it literally melted in our mouths. The cheddar cheese and sweet spicy horseradish sauce complimented the tender beef perfectly.   The only bad thing I can say about Earl of Sandwich is that the sammies are on the smaller side and you might need more than one if you are a big eater.  Don't wait any longer to try this place it is worth standing in line for and it won't dent your wallet.",

There aren't many tables and seats for people to dine in.  This place is crowded, but it deserves it due to the deliciousness of their sandwiches.    I tried the Tuna Melt here and it was enjoyable. For about $6 I was able to indulge in the soft freshly-baked bread and the warm tuna filling.  The sandwich isn't huge, but it does grant satisfaction to the taste buds and is very easy-going on the teeth and gum when I take a bite into it.  I also tried the \"Full Montagu\", which was not as flavorful.  It still was enjoyable and I can eat about 5 of it.  My favorite is the Italian sandwich, since there was a good amount of flavor in the salami and vegetables.  Overall, the sandwiches should be a little bigger and some of them need a kick in flavor.  My experience would have been better if they did not give us the wrong buzzer and made us wait 45 minutes for the sandwiches.  We were trying to be patient and waited for the sandwiches.  After 45 minutes, we decided to go back up and ask why they took so long. Then they explained the situation and made us fresh, new sandwiches.  In addition, they gave us a FULL refund.  Their level of dealing with customer concerns is awesome.",

Wait a few wih your buzzee and bzz it's out!   Tuna Melt (albacore tuna salad + swiss cheese)= soooooo delicious. seriously... I have dreams about that sandwich!! And it's super filling without being too \"fishy\" lol.   Earls Club ( roasted turkey, smoked bacon, swiss, letuce tomato sandwich sauce )= so fresh! very very flavorful sandwich that can't disappoint!  Full Montagu (roasted beef turkey swiss and cheddar letuce earl mustard)= My little bro really liked this sandwich. He just scarfed it down = sign of a good time!  Notes:  * veggie sandwich is a no no. not enough veggies in that sandwich to keep you full. I felt like I was just ingesting carbs as opposed to vegetables AND carbs.  * don't expect a large sandwich! the sandwich sizes actually run kind of small. yes you are paying for good flavor, but you're also paying for the brand itself.  * purchasing an Earl of Sandwich is an experience most people like to incorporate into their Vegas experience. Take it or leave it.   I may be coming around again!! :) tehehe until next time!",

My boyfriend doesn't like mustard and this sandwich comes with it; he still eats it and raves that the mustard is perfect. That says a lot!   While we had great service here, our friends unfortunately ran into some trouble, which was a little awkward. I guess one of their machines went down and they said something to them and just walked away, leaving them standing there and looking uncomfortable. I guess the weird part was that there were workers all around them and they weren't even looking at them or apologizing. Like I said, awkward. But, that doesn't change the deliciousness of the food and when you're coming here for your first meal after you've been in Vegas for more than a handful of hours, it's a perfectly filling and tasty one!",

You don't get to select the type of bread or customize your sandwich like most sandwich shops do so you're stuck with what you ordered. My son didn't like his non \"grilled cheese\" sandwich which looked more like a warm muffin with cheese in it and a bit dry I might add. My ham and cheese sandwich was ok didn't blow me away -- average at best. Prices I like but not the long wait, not enough tables and chairs to accommodate the crowd is what really killed it for me. We literally waited 45 minutes for our order while trying to find seating for four. We ended up spending more than an hour at this \"slow food\" joint. Would I come back next time? Probably but avoid lunch and dinner times at all cost unless you like slow service and the crowd.",

Nope, just as delicious sober as the first time.  I have been back several times and have had several breakfast and hot sandwiches. My favorite thing is the Earl Grey Lemonade. It's half lemonade, half iced tea. So glad they have a delicious alternative to soda!  If you go for the first time, don't get scared off by the long line. It moves really fast, and it's totally worth it!",

For those of us who are not 21, there are very few activities we can enjoy in Vegas. Fortunately Earls is friendly to patrons of all ages. (although you have to hurry if you enter through the Planet Hollywood entrance; try and use the Miracle mile shop entrance to avoid being harassed by pit bosses and the like.)  I have tried their house sandwich and roast beef, both of them taste alright. But the Tuna Melt is absolutely perfect, I really mean perfect. You can make no amount of spices or make any other adjustment to that sandwich which will make it taste any better!   Pros:  *Best tuna melt in the US. Maybe the world. *Price (~$6)  Cons:  *Long lines.",

Haha!  I turned my sandwich into a wrap (which you can totally do).  I was very excited to finally try Earl of Sandwich and my expectations were very high.  But just a warning for you vegetarians.  The wrap will be underwhelming.  Not exciting, a bit bland...but again, not the Earl's fault!  It's just the vegetarian option isn't a lot to look forward to.  Yes meat lovers, you'll love it.

The first time I had a Caprese sandwich with white bread. My company had a Tuna Melt sandwich and Chipotle Chicken Avocado sandwich, both with white bread. Company thought first sandwich was average but raved about the latter. They also have complimentary water which is nice given that Starbucks on the Strip charge $1 for tap. During our visit, we were given a bogo promotional card, so the second time I went I ordered a Caprese sandwich with multi-grain bread and a Soft drink and got a free Chipotle Chicken Avocado. I enjoyed my Caprese sandwiches both times! They have spacious seating but it's inside a casino, so I'd recommend eating somewhere nice outside (they give it to you to-go anyway).",

Service is fine but minimal as it is fast-casual. I can see why people like this place, but it didn't impress me enough to win a fifth star.",

We were pretty hungry so we couldn't miss an opportunity to go to a fast food joint that prides themselves to being \" The World's greatest hot sandwich\"  Looking for something quick. I gotta say it hit the spot. Although mine came out a little too barbecuey it was delicious to say the least. At least they ain't cheap on the sauce  My suggestion is if you come here... get one that they have a pictured up on the screen before trying a random one. Unless you like everything that the sub comes with. Because after all , they are there for a reason.  I believe the other hot subs can easily top my Hawaiian bbq sub (chicken, ham, pineapple, and bbq sauce). It kinda reminds of the Hawaiian pizza but in sub form. I also got a chance to try the tuna one. I usually don't like tuna but it made me hooked ;)",

Their bread was nice and toasted and their sauce, which kind of reminds me of thousand island, was good. I even took half back to the hotel to eat it hours later and I still enjoyed it.   According to my friends, the one located in Anaheim, which I used to go to, closed down. I was pretty surprised to hear that since there was always so many people, so I decided to buy one to go.

Their spicy tuna sandwich has a special aoili sauce that gives the tuna a kick. Their Hickory smoked BBQ sandwich is sweet and tangy. One of the best melt in your mouth sandwiches ever tasted.   My favorite sandwich is the pastrami with saurkraut mixed with a special coleslaw sauce and corned beef. They drench their corned beef in a succulent dressing to give it a softer texture and taste.   The service is fast and the waitresses are kind. The environment however can be noisy due to the Rockstar being across from it.    In conclusion, if you like sandwiches, this place is legendary. I will definitely recommend it and will be back again to try different sandwiches. The only Con is the loud music and being so close to the casino. The smell of smoke is just unappealing. It would be better to take your sandwich to go.",

    "text": "Okay, the only comparison that can be made to Quizno's here is the fact that the bread is toasted. There, the similarities stop.  Earl of Sandwich is in a different league entirely than Quizno's.  The bread is toasted to a perfect crisp, and the two sandwiches that I tried were both amazing... the vegetarian and the California chipotle chicken.  I was skeptical about how a sandwich place could have so many positive reviews, but now I know.  I would definitely come back here if I was in Vegas, and that's saying a lot, given how many options there are in Vegas and how hard it is to navigate to a specific place in a casino.  We had lunch here, but I can see this as being an amazing 5 am option after a night of clubbing (they are open 24 hours).  The line is looooong but it moves quickly and efficiently.  Oh, it's also CHEAP.. at $5.99 a sandwich or $6.49 for a \"special\" sandwich and no need to tip since you place an order at the counter then get a pager to go pick it up when it's ready.",

Also got ourselves a little dessert of brownie bite. I must say there was a LONG line but it went by pretty quick.

You could probably even add a bag of chips, a cookie, or a side and still pay under $10 for your whole meal. Very hard to find that kind of deal for quality food on Las Vegas Blvd. It's open 24 hours, too!  I ordered two sandwiches, the Caribbean Jerk Chicken and the Full Montagu, and ate half of each. I was really hoping the sandwiches would very delicious. But it was just OK in my book. Nothing wrong with them, mind you. I just was thinking I'd be wowed with flavor.  That's probably the only reason I couldn't give 5 stars here, even though I wanted to. The service was fast, they kept the line moving swiftly, there was decent amount of seating available, and clean. I thought it was kind of cool that a casual sandwich place used vibrating beepers to let you know your order was ready to be picked up!  I wouldn't say it's a convenient place to eat for a local, but I'd definitely think it's an awesome place to dine if you're in the area nearby. Great value for your money and more than worth getting, compared to the same you'll spend for unhealthy fast food.   It was a great stop for lunch. Or anytime for that matter! Try it :)",

My friend and I got different sandwiches and shared them because the sandwiches are cut in half and wrapped in gold foil. And it's only about $6.  These sandwiches are some of the best hot sandwiches I've had in my life. And this means a lot because I'm not a big sandwich person. In fact, I don't usually like sandwiches at all unless it's from Earl or Mendocino Farms (<a href=\"http://www.yelp.com/biz/mendocino-farms-marina-del-rey#hrid:i5yib0JkoKXuHvnn33_ofg\">yelp.com/biz/mendocino-f...</a>).  I haven't tried a sandwich that I didn't find delicious. I tried the Full Montagu, The Original 1762, The Earl's Club, and the Italian sandwiches. They were all good in different ways. The Original 1762 doesn't have much on the sandwich, but it's simple and delicious. I loved the kick from the horseradish sauce.   My goal is to try them all!  They have specials as well. I think the current special is the chicken, bacon, avocado sandwich.  I'm so excited for the new Downtown Disney location to open. I can fulfill all my Earl of Sandwiches craving there!",

Yep, but in an unlikely place, that being just inside Planet Hollywood near the entrance off Las Vegas Blvd.  This place is not hidden and it's not a secret, plus it has the best hours possible for the Strip (open 24 hrs).  Whoever came up with such an idea for Vegas must be crazy.  Usually I'd have a larger lunch with a higher price elsewhere, then end up here for a cheap dinner.  I had the Caribbean Jerk Chicken, the Earl's Club, and the All American sandwiches. The Caribbean Jerk was easily the best, the others were good but not great, although clearly above the level of most chains.  They are $5.99 each, but not large enough to be a complete meal, so you'll want to get a side.  I usually went with a house salad for $1.79, despite how tempting all the little treats around were, like the triple chocolate brownies or the chocolate banana muffins.  Kinda defeats the purpose of coming here to get a sandwich due to it being healthier than food court options, but I guess they have something for everyone (fruits, yogurt parfait, etc).  While it gets busy, they run a pretty smooth operation with assembly line like efficiency (the layout from where you order, what else you can grab, where you pay, where you pick up, and where all the employees are and what function they serve).  The only thing is once your thing starts vibrating (and by thing, I mean the square coaster/pager that tells you when your order is ready) it will go on for what seems like an eternity.  I guess them putting a vibrating thing in my hand is what gives this the Vegas touch.",

They just got this seasonal holiday sandwich. Turkey, swiss, cranberry, stuffing, and covered in a special mayo sauce... like having a party in your mouth! Seriously melts in your mouth. Open 24 hours too.  Best place for a small lunch or night of good fun!",

I am not particularly fond of eating out at sandwich places because I love to grub, but I was in Vegas last week- and figured I'd give it a shot since i and some friends were looking for a quick snack before dinner that night. I'd have to say the sandwiches were really really good! I think what made it good was the bread. I ordered the Earl club, I think it was, and it pretty much hit the spot! I also shared the Cobb type salad which was delicious! There was a light dressing which was flavorful and a good blend of turkey and bits like cranberry and light cheese in there. The experience was so good we went again on our 4 night stay in Vegas! First time we went, there was no line. It was a weekday during the late afternoon. The second time was a Saturday afternoon and the line was long! But it moved very quickly. I was surprised.  I want me another Earl of sandwich!",

I've also had the tortilla soup and the broccoli cheddar soup, which both are REALLY good.  Dip your sandwich in the soup, it makes the sandwich a lot better than it already is.",

Also because once we got out of O, we were starving and this was one of the few places still open after 10pm on a sunday that was inexpensive.  So glad we decided to go here.  I got the hawaiian bbq and he got the earl's club.  Mine was a little to sweet, so he gave me the other half of his sandwich.  wow, the earls club was soooooo good.  I still crave it.  It was so good we went back the next day and split one for lunch.  There macaroni salad is tasty too.  The bread...so good...the melted cheese, the turkey, bacon, lettuce tomato...just yummy in my tummy!  Gotta try it for yourself!",

An hour and a half worth of walking through tons and tons of people, we got to PH and went to the restaurant at 1 in the morning. My friend that went there before recommended that I try the montague, and boy I was pleasantly surprised. The panini crumbled into small little pieces of heavenly goodness as I bit into the sandwich. The cheese, meat, and THE SAUCE they had was for less of word...exquisite.

Mouthwatering tuna on a fluffy soft yet slightly crispy bun with gooey melted cheese and flavors that I didn't know tuna could have. Of course, it must be explosive calorie-wise, but when its that good, who the hell cares. Give me two.   I've also tried the Montagu (I'm pretty sure I spelled that wrong, apologize in advance) as well as the original, and still, I stand by the fact that their best is the Tuna Melt. Their worst sandwich that I've tried thus far is the Hawaiian Chicken one (or something like that) which was kinda bland and the chicken had no flavor. Chipotle chicken is okay, but when the Tuna is that good...  This is my go-to place for lunch in Vegas, especially since its convenient, quick, and has good ingredients. OH! And their brownie is pretty good too.",

I think like six of my friends ordered the Full Montagu, so I decided to go with the Original. It usually doesn't get much safer than \"the Original,\" but I was so disappointed. No, I was devastated at how much of a letdown this sandwich was. The bread is good, but it was the best part about the sandwich. The fuckin BREAD. I could tell that Earl was going with a completely different concept with his sandwich than Ike (@ Lime). Whereas Ike mindfucks you with an avalanche of ingredients and flavors, Earl keeps his sandwiches as simple as possible. My Original had bread, meat, and sauce. That's it. I wanted so badly to appreciate the simplistic beauty of it, but I couldn't. It's just too boring.  I had a bite of the Full Montagu, I was not impressed. I had a bite of the Italian. I was decently impressed. I've heard good things about the Hawaiian, so I'll come back to try that. If it sucks too, then I am done with you Earl. You've literally broken my heart. Bastard.",

The sandwich was good, the cranberries were a nice touch, but it wasn't the greatest sandwich ever.   I want to say this place is over-rated, but I have to try a sandwich to make that claim. Their frozen lemonade was good.... typical. Service was rushed and when our to-go bag handle broke, the servers behind the counter were in such a rush to get everyone's order in that he didn't bother to replace the bag. Oh well.

The original I got was yummy and I finish within a few minutes..felt like a snack to me but it was enough. Will try a different one next time...but which one?",

Shared a salad - the Caprese Salad -  Field Greens & Romaine, Fresh Mozzarella Cheese, Roma Tomato, Fresh Basil & Balsamic Vinaigrette.  Very fresh salad.",

Got the Montague, Tuna Melt and Club.  I got the club (which to my surprise was the best tasting of the three. (Yay for me) My other gfs got the Montague and Tuna Melt.  The bread is nice and crisp.  The Tuna Melt was bland to me. It needed more salt or something! I guess I'm use to more greasy Tuna Melts - because it just felt like it was missing a whole lot. The Montague sandwich tasted like something I could make at home.  The club sandwich was nicely executed. Fresh ingredients and great sauce - not too heavy and not making the bread soggy. I only ate 1/2 and i ate the other 1/2 later after a drunken night of partying and it was still good.  I'm probably the only person in my group who thought it was \"whatevers.\"    I'd save the $6 and go to Five Guys =P",

It is nonetheless a good sandwich indeed...but what is the best sandwich I wouldn't know cause the day before I had a pretty damn good pastrami sandwich at Canter's Deli in Treasure Island.   Usually a sandwich place can't really mess up on a sandwich so I feel like  I could only give it three stars...I can't say much about the service since you just order and pick it up.  Kinda on the pricey side but then again it is Vegas..so everything is pretty much overpriced anyways. Would I eat that this place again? Sure..why not? =)",

I hear their cobb wraps are just as good. Their sandwiches are about $6, which is the best cheapest thing you can get in Vegas for an amazing hot sandwich.  I make a stop here at least twice on every Vegas trip I've made. Earl's is too irresistible. At one point, Earl's was my breakfast/lunch/dinner/post-club food @ 6AM. It's 24 hours so if you're feeling hungry or need some hangover food, go here!",

For around 7 bucks I got a Chicken Caesar Wrap that was packed tightly with lettuce, diced chicken, shaved parmesan cheese, and an excess of SALTY dressing. Want a wheat tortilla instead of the default white flour version? Too bad because they don't have that option. Their version of this wrap wasn't the best that I've had, and it actually irritated my stomach.   Anticipate long lines, crowds of diners, and limited seating if you plan on eating here.  The ordering process goes like this: place your order at one end and move down to the other to pay. Along the way, you're tempted to increase your bill with sweets, chips, and bottled beverages. If possible, It might be a good idea to place an order to go and eat elsewhere.  This was my first and last trip to this place, which is another overpriced eatery on The Strip offering mediocre food.  And that's a wrap.",

Just make sure you have gum so you won't smell too fishy afterwards! - Chipotle Chicken Avocado: I'm a big fan of chicken and avocado, so this was pretty much perfect. There was a good amount of sauce so the chipotle flavor wasn't too overpowering. - The Earl's Club: turkey, bacon, swiss, lettuce and tomato. Basic sandwich, but tastes great!  There's always a line (and a pretty long one at that), but the line does move pretty fast. If you can't get a table, at least it's easy to carry back to your hotel room! Sandwiches here are also a great for drunchies! ;)",

Without further ado - I would have to say that the sandwiches here are definitely better than the Anaheim location. However, sandwiches from both place are still delicious!

You go into these weird alley ways, which somehow lead to parking.   It is inside Planet Hollywood. The mall itself is nice, especially early in the morning when Vegas sleeps and you can window shop.   I ordered the Italian, which is loaded with meat. It was delicious. One of my fondest memories is eating pizza grinders from a neighborhood joint, and Earl of Sandwich brought those wonderful memories back. Admittedly, the sandwich was small and I have suspicions the bread could be better, but somehow it came together in my mouth quite perfectly. The meats are really tasty and the cheese is a good balancing flavor.   My man ordered a bacon, egg and cheese sandwich. It looked nasty and I think he made a comment about the egg looking janky. He thought it was just ok.   The broccoli cheddar soup was not good. I expect a hearty, chicken based broccoli cheddar flavor. The Earl's tasted of fake cheese and the texture was off. Would definitely pass next time.   In summary, the portions are small, but if you order the right sandwich according to your taste buds, you will be happy and satiated enough to walk on the Strip. I would avoid the soup (which was tiny) and the breakfast sandwiches.",

Every time I have gone, I have gotten lucky because lines were not too crazy, but regardless, the lines tend to move fairly quickly. I would highly recommend eating here!! It is not a fancy sit down place, but in my opinion, the food is better than most sit down places I have been to.  The sandwiches are warm and so flavorful. They seem so simple, but this is a go to for me every time I come to Vegas! My wife loooves the veggie and the caprese sandwich and claims it might be better than Ike's. I think I have tried a handful of them (chipotle chicken avacado, avocado BLT, Earl's Club) and have never been disappointed with any of them.  Ultimately, it is easy to find, cheap and delicious!

    "text": "I've been wanting to try this place ever since it opened to rave reviews on Yelp.  But we don't go to Strip places very often unless we have a reason.  We finally did:  a new show with comp tix at Planet Hollywood, and two hungry Yelpers not wanting to wait to eat after the show ended.  Perfect match.     Hubby and I both decided to order the same sandwich, pastrami, which doesn't let me write an extensive review of the food.  It was a good sandwich, very lean pastrami, but not all that plentiful.  The reported swiss cheese wasn't noticeable.  That was okay with me: I don't like swiss cheese, but didn't change it because to my way of thinking, cheese on a pastrami sandwich is sacrilegious.  Strip prices being what they are, though, I guess it was as much as we should have expected, because this was  reasonably priced based on Earl's location.  The bread?  Good, now that I've all but given up hope of ever finding a sandwich on a crisp baguette in Las Vegas.  I'll have to go back to the east coast for that bit of heaven.  We also ordered a bowl of tortilla soup.  I didn't want to, since I learned only after asking that it's a cream soup.  Rule #1:  authentic tortilla soup does not contain cream.  Rule #2:  I should not eat creamed soups.  They're bad for me.  And for my husband.  But he's not as much as a stickler for the rules as I am, so I let him get it after learning - again only after asking - that the tomato soup was also CREAM of tomato.  So much for healthier alternatives.  Would it be so hard to write that on the chalkboard these soups were listed on?  Having said that, it was a very tasty soup, as long as I didn't tell myself that it was tortilla soup (See Rule #1 above).    In sum, Earl of Sandwich is a decent place if you're a tourist in LV on a budget.  For us, we're not likely to feel the urge to return unless we're at PH again for some reason and in a hurry.",

    "text": "\"Serf of Sandwich\" is more like it.  There doesn't seem to be any \"Earl\" like qualities about this place or the food for that matter.  The title of Earl is reserved for the aristocratic English nobility, and so it would seem that the sandwiches/products may or would exhibit some kind of high quality.   Yes, it's cheap but it just seems ordinary to me.  In fact, my entire dining experience was not very memorable at all.  It all seemed like a bad dream and I couldn't wait to wake up so to speak.  LOCATION:  Miracle Mile Shops at Planet Hollywood Hotel and Casino.  There is one line that forms for the ordering counter.  Menus are displayed above the ordering station/kitchen or near the waiting area for the line.  Various cold, hot and breakfast sandwiches available.  Admittedly, there are a wide variety of choices on their menu.  Sides and sodas (self serve) available as well.  After looking over their menu I finally decided on the pastrami reuben.  I honestly can't remember the sandwiches my two friends had since no one took pics or seemed satisfied with their food.  We all shared sides of chips, and potato and pasta salads.  FOOD:   Just ok really.  My sandwich was just alright.  Priced at $6.49 I thought it would have been bigger and better (I'm really wishing I took a picture right now).  I think the three of us finished most of our food because we were hungry having decided to forgot breakfast that morning.  In any case, the food was somewhat acceptable.  The sides were just ok as well.  SERVICE:   Not great.  And here's a tip:  you don't pay for your meal when you order your food.  The staff will take your sandwich order at the first counter and provide a pager to indicate when your food is ready.  We arrived at 1030am and the line was already building with the lunch crowd.  There was only one staff ringing up customer at the pay counter and it seemed that the other staff didn't care or want to help the poor guy out.  My friends and I waited what seemed like an eternity to pay for our food.    side NOTE:  You can pick up sides, i.e. potato salad and chips, along the counter space between the order and pay stations.    WHY?:  Why aren't there more seats or a larger seating area since this place seems to so popular??    BOTTOM LINE:  I'm honestly not too sure why this place is so popular.  I thought it was alright.  There really should be a larger seating area for customers.",

I've had the Earl's in Midtown, but it's just not the same. Tastes so much better in Vegas. So I highly highly recommend this place. Whether it's for breakfast, lunch, dinner, or because you're drunk and need a snack.   Believe me when I say you won't be disappointed!",

I went with a club sandwich and it was easily one of best sandwiches I have ever had. Bread beautifully toasted, meats fresh, tomatoes and lettuce fresh and just the right amount of condiments, this sandwich was everything I needed and more.  My only issue with Earl of Sandwich was it was hard as hell to find, I wanted around in loops forever looking for it, I'm not really holding this against Earl of Sandwich as my horrible sense of direction was truly to blame. Anyway this place is worth a visit for sure.",

It's actually quite surprising that the prices are so reasonable, since everything in Vegas is over priced.  The first time I ate here was back in 2012, and I did not have any expectations at all because I was hungover and hungry.  What better than a good sammy in your tummy after a long night of drinking?    Earl of Sandwich is located inside the Planet Hollywood hotel, which is conveniently next door to Paris, and it is also right across the street from the Cosmo where I used to stay frequently. Earl is very popular and the line can get a little long here during peak hours, but their ordering system is efficient and they are quick to deliver your food.  The two sammy's that I like are the Earl's Club or the Chipotle chicken avocado sandwich.  The warm bread is crispy on the outside and soft on the inside just like it should be, and all of the ingredients are fresh.  If you think about it, everything has to be fresh, since they probably sell hundreds of sandwiches per day since they are open 24/7.  If you are a sandwich lover, you should give this place a try.",

Ordered:  1/2 Earl's Club with Turkey & 1/2 Full Montagu Total incl gratuity: ~$6pp  Pretty darn good for a hot sandwich, I'll definitely give 'em that!  After a very eventful Thursday night at Tao, it was hard to drag my booty outta bed but my girlfriend and I decided we wanted sandwiches so we walked ourselves across the street to Planet Hollywood to get some sandwiches.  (We were staying at the Cosmo.  The walk wasn't too bad, btw).  Much on the menu looked tempting but my gf ordered one and I ordered another and we each ate half.  Both were pretty tasty but I'd have to say the club wins by a hair!  Bread is nice and toasty but not overly toasty where it's crunchy.  The sauces and the meats were perfectly portioned.  The sandwich is good enough that when you finish it, you actually want more.  Come to think of it, I really should have ordered another one for Saturday morning because the same thing happened.  Eventful night at XS = no desire to get up in the morning and walk to get something to eat.  Nonetheless, very tasty and inexpensive place to grab a fuifilling lunch!  $6.00. Oh heck yeah!

The creamy tomato soup was perfect with the sandwich. The crunchy'Mediterranean Wrap' was delicious too. And if you are not conscious for your calories, then you must try their 'Triple Chocolate Brownies'.   The only turn-off was that they had no wheat bread.

They gave us a beeper and we kept waiting and saw others that came after us get their food I finally went up and our food was just sitting there.  The buzzer never went off. Probably wouldn't go back.",

If its your first time I suggest the Earl's club/ Montagu. they're very simple and delicious sandwiches. Every time we come to Vegas we NEVER i mean NEVER forget to come grab a sandwich. The plus side is that its INEXPENSIVE! The bread is at the right crisp and just compliments EVERYTHING. The line can get a little long after clubbing/eating hours but its worth the wait! You can tell by the lines how good it can be! this place is a MUST MUST try.",

Hot sandwiches wraps and salads at affordable prices, and you even have the option to call ahead and order which I recommend considering the line tends to get a bit long. If you are in the mood for something quick to eat that will get you energized at ready to go I would urge you to go to earl of sandwich. Overall great service, awesome signature wraps and sandwiches definitely worth a trip to planet Hollywood for.",

    "text": "BEST SANDWICH PLACE... EVER!!!!!!!  Seriously, if you're in vegas, and you haven't eaten here... TRY IT! you'll definitely fall in love... at least i did! This place is inside the Miracle Mile Shopping Center of Planet Hollywood! It's right across from the Sugar Factory. This place has earned the right to call itself the BEST SANDWICH SHOP IN THE WORLD!!! They're open 24 hrs. Each sandwich is only $5.99 and they're SOOOOO WORTH IT!   Here's how it works: You get in line, place your order. You'll receive a buzzing device that will notify you when your order is ready. You proceed along the line and pick up whatever else you want... like a potato salad, macaroni salad, cold slaw, chips, cookies, ice cream, etc. Then you get to the cashier, and pay for your order. You find a table and get your seat. Then your device will go off and you pick up your food. You come back to your table (if you're eating there... why not? cuz it'll be hot and fresh!) and divulge into a little piece of heaven. That's right! You will not be able to help yourself and will let out a small moan because it's that good!   My fav is the Best BLT. For some reason, there's no sauce(i get it without mayo), no cheese or anything... but this place makes the sandwich JUICY! I dunno how that's possible! The Earl's Club is pretty good, too! That comes with turkey, bacon, swiss cheese, lettuce, roma tomatoes, and their special sandwich sauce. Let me just say, the tomatoes in this sandwich are sooooooooooo tasty. They're seasoned and super sweet!   This place got everything right! Bread? Perfectly toasted! Meats? Nicely packed onto the sandwich! Lettuce and Tomatoes? Super fresh!  NOW, I CRAVE THIS PLACE!!!!!!!",

For $4 each you can get a breakfast sandwich with ham and cheese (Swiss or cheddar) and a couple other combos. They also have nice looking yogurt parfaits for the same price, plus some baked goods. Not a huge meal by any means but a nice light breakfast if you want something cheap.  For $6 each you can get a hot sandwich or a substantial sized salad.  Nothing is amazing (my club sandwich was made with deli-style turkey meat as opposed to actual roast turkey) but it is good.  The hot sandwiches are made on really good crispy rolls.  It is also open 24 hours.",

    "text": "After shopping at the Miracle Mile Shops, and getting our Fat Tuesday slushy drinks with alcohol, my friends and I were hungry and decided to get a small bite before having dinner. Our friend Danny suggested to go to this place because he said they had the best sandwiches. We were all a little iffy about this place because Danny wasn't someone you would take suggestions from, but we tried it anyway because we were starving.   Their hot sandwiches were $5.99, which isn't too bad. It seemed as though everyone got The Earl's Club - Roasted Turkey, Smoked Bacon, Swiss Cheese, Lettuce, Roma Tomato & Sandwich Sauce. It was DELICIOUS!!! Probably one of the BEST hot sandwiches I've ever had. I also had their sea salt and vinegar kettle chips and they were pretty good too. My friend Amanda got their Tomato Soup and she said it was yummy as well. I heard nothing but greatness from this place.  It was soooo good, that we came back later after clubbing because they're open 24/7 and close to where we stayed (Planet Hollywood Westgate Towers).   I would definitely recommend coming here for your late night/early morning food cravings instead of McDonalds or whatever place is open past midnight. I would even suggest coming here for lunch. I wish they had a closer location to Orange County because I would go here a lot if they did, but the closest is the one in Vegas.    P.S. This is probably 1 of the 2 best things our friend Danny did on our trip while in Vegas, and that should say a lot! ;P",

    "text": "It's not that the Earl of Sandwich makes the best food on the Strip -- far from it.  Of course, the freshly par-baked bread is super hot and soft, and the fillings are generous and deliciously melted together in a fashion that will delight drunken and sober tastebuds alike.  However, the Earl of Sandwich deserves five stars for the fact that it is a cheap, fast, and delicious place to grab a bite at any time of the day.  Las Vegas seems to suffer from an excess of medium expensive restaurants that boast fancy-pants menus that aren't anything special, and this restaurant is just a refreshing, tasty alternative to that.    This place looks like a fast food type chain (in fact, after examining their website I see that they are an international chain, and they most definitely need to open a shop in Los Angeles), but don't be fooled by the ultra-reasonable menu and the assembly line of workers: these sandwiches are def the real deal.  When I came here, I split a ham and cheese and an original roast beef with my friends: both sandwiches were excellent, with a nice tanginess from the mustard on the ham and cheese, and a very mild kick from the horseradish sauce on the roast beef.  The sandwiches were a nice size, although the boys in our group wanted two each for dinner.  At a little over $5 a pop, though, you'll still have plenty left in your pockets for the slot machine.  It's also open late at night -- a perfect post-club snack spot!",

Especially after a night of partying, all you need to do is pop the other half of sandwich in the microwave and  you have a quick BRUNCH! :)  Located inside Planet Hollywood. - You will see PINK'S HOT DOGS outside( If you go inside where Urban Outfitters is, then you're at the wrong entrance) However, there still is a way to get to Earl's from there!  - Go inside Miracle Miles Shops - When you walk inside you will see Rock Bar to the right.  - Keep going straight, and to your LEFT you will see the HUGE \"EARL OF SANDWICH\" sign. :) You won't miss it. - However, if you keep going straight, you will see FAT TUESDAY. You can buy a FAT TUESDAY.... -THEN, walk backwards to go back to Earl of Sandwich :)",

Juicy roast beef that wasn't overcooked with the cheese melted right on top. Their coffee is quite good too. The place is open 24 hours, so it's a great place to pick up a meal at any time of day.

However on my most recent trip to Vegas I stayed at PH so I had very easy access to Earl's. I literally ate it all weekend. Everyone raves about the chipotle chicken, which is the best. They also have a selection of soups and I really loved the chicken tortilla! The clam chowder was tooooo watery. They also have a selection of sides; I was debating between trying the parfait and potato salad.. I mean you really can't go wrong with either and now I wish I just got both but at the time their parfait hit the spot as I took it to go and ate it while walking around the strip! Earl of Sandwich is a MUST while in Vegas especially if you're tryna eat on a budget :). Now my only wish is that they would open up more locations! I have yet to visit the one in downtown Disney...

    "text": "Another 5 star review for this sandwich spot?! I guess so.  When we got to Earl of Sandwich, the worst possible thing that could have happened, did. Their system was down for 45 mins - 1 hour. Which means no sandwiches for 45 mins - 1 hour. We kinda just stood around Earl's hoping a miracle would happen & their system would magically start working again. Wrong. Even Planet Hollywood workers stood in line behind us thinking everything was fine until we said \"Their system is down for 45 mins - 1 hour. Do you know of any other good food places we could eat at?\" Their response. \"No way! Earl's is the only place we come for food.\" We didn't eat the whole day because we wanted to try the sandwiches, so we were pretty much starving. We couldn't wait, so we just ate at another local food spot for a quick fix.  The next day, we were able to finally try Earl's. The line was huge. I mean, for a sandwich? Is this line really necessary? YES. I can't really describe the feeling of this sandwich as it hit my taste buds. It was like a party in my mouth. I must say, the anticipation for this sandwich made it that much better. Something about the bread completes this sandwich. I got the All American, & also tried the Caribbean Jerk, Tuna Melt, & Original. They were all very delicious. For all you vegetarians out there, you NEED to try the Tuna Melt. Also, their prices can't be beat! $5.99 for any hot sandwich.  I was in Vegas for 4 days, so trying out all the local top notch food spots was a must. Since 4 days is not that long, you wouldn't think of going to the same food spot twice during your stay right? Uhm, sure.. Okay. ;)",

If you're too poor to afford the buffet or if you lost all your money from gambling, do not feel hopeless to tackle good food! This is it right here. So delicious for an affordable price. And i hate tomatoes but I swear they use magical tomatoes in their tomato bisque soup.....",

Simple, yet delicious.  My wife's favorite is the BLT.    The sandwiches only come in one size.  They aren't huge, but they are large enough.  My wife and I each get a sandwich and then spit a yogurt parfet for dessert.  The are reasonably priced, giving you more money for the casino's.",

    "text": "This is my very first review after coming back from South Korea! I got back 2 weeks ago.. and went to Vegas for the weekend with the family, and I knew this would be a great opportunity to rack up some Yelp reviews to make up for lost time!!  So I drove in and went to the coveted Earl of Sandwich..   This place is as good as they say! I tried 4 sandwiches and a soup thanks to my family, and we each got:  Caribbean Jerk Chicken: mine! This was really good and spicy, with banana peppers and nicely grilled chicken. Twas delicious. The Original: My mom/dad split this one..  we all really liked it as we exchanged sandwiches (benefits of having a family that loves variety :P) Good roast beef! And the Original is a solid choice...No wonder why this place became so popular!  The Full Montagu: My sister got this one.. and we all agreed that it was our favorite out of the 3... It had turkey? And Roast beef... and cheese with lettuce.. Delicious. Tomato soup: It was like gourmet Spaghetti-Os... It was ok and had croutons, but I don't remember how much it was... I'd rather have gotten another sandwich.  My sister and I went for a second round...So we got:  The Italian. This is by far our most favorite sandwich. This is the reason why you need to come here. I learned that Mortadello was Italian bologna, and it came with mozzarella, tomato, and it was good, good, goooooOOOood!!!  Oh, and the Earl Grey Lemonade needs sugar. Nothing 4 Splenda's can't fix. Or you could just get a pink lemonade too..   There's so much I wanted to try too! The Meatball, Hawaiian Chicken, etc etc..   Food. Fresh and Hot. Service. Quick.  Each sandwich I had was definitely worth $5.99. 5 Stars. Simple as that.",

I will admit I'd rather eat these sandwiches for breakfast or dinner than have denny's.  The bread is really good when they toast the bread but after about an hour, if you don't eat the sandwich, it's not that good anymore.  Their salads are okay so should have got their wraps instead.  One morning I ordered the egg & cheese breakfast sandwich...definitely better than mcdonalds.  Wish they had these in California....oh well.  Now that I know its there, I'll be back I'm sure! :)",

Every time I'm in Vegas I always stop at Earl for lunch - I stick with the Earl's Club - but I've tried the full montague, the hawaiian bbq and several others and they're all delicious.  Oh, make sure you get the sauce on your sandwich, usually I never get sauce or spreads on my sandwiches because they're mostly loaded with fat but this sauce is awesome - it's the only place where I don't tell them to leave it off.  I guess this place recently became popular, I've been stopping here for a few years and it was never all that busy.  I was there this weekend and all of a sudden there were huge lines.  Normally I hate standing in lines, but their sandwiches are so good that I thought it would be worth it....  Bottom line - this is a great lunch spot in the middle of the strip and the sandwiches are all awesome.  Apparently you need to be ready to stand in line now though...",

Granted, this sandwich was ordered while suffering from a food hangover from a fancy dinner tthe night before AND 6 am nachos earlier that morning, but work with me here and see me for the rough & tough PB&J (not P & BJ) gal that I be.  $3.95 for a freaking sandwich.  What a bargain!  At the sandwich place by my office in San Francisco, this pretty little focaccia & peanut buttery goodness would have set me back ten big ones.  Instead, I left with almost six dollars to blow on the wheel-of-fortune slot machines that call my name in their sweet, sweet way.  The $3.95 special was off the Kid's Menu, but I batted my eyelashes in an epileptic way that I haven't done since I ran a red light during my driving test and really, really, REALLY needed my license.  Two PB&Js later, Lindsey and I headed up to our room to prepare for another chaotic evening.   Unpretentious + Inexpensive = 4 peanut butter & jelly-filled stars",

If you're really hungry, throw in a soup too.  They tend to be more thick and hardy, so it will help to fill you up.

Such is life in Las Vegas, but I had one last chance to end my trip on a good note.  A quick drive over to Planet Hollywood to try this sandwich place that I had read so many good things about.  When we arrived, the line was going out the door and I just had a good feeling that I was about to be in for a treat.  I looked over the menu trying to decide on which sandwich to get.  The original?  The Full Montagu?  Cannonballs?!??  Ahh, so many delicious sounding choices!   I got to the counter to order and still wasn't sure.  I asked if it was possible to do half and half, but no it's not possible.  I ended up going with the Full Montagu.  My friend went with the Italian.  Upon first bite everything terrible that had happened the night before went away.  That girl who's name/number I didn't get....the throwing up next to a slot machine, the $200 I lost at the craps table...GONE.  I was in culinary heaven.  The sandwich was so good and for the price it was just amazing.  $5.99 for a great sandwich?!?!?!?  I felt like I had won the jackpot!    My only regret is that I didn't get to try some of the other sandwiches.  Next time I'll just have to go and get some more, but the Full Montagu was a legit sandwich.  Now if I could only remember the name of that lovely girl I met and how I went from dancing/making out with her to throwing up next to a slot machine....some things may be better off unknown.",

The line moved fairly quickly, and I was torn between healthy and filling so I ordered a sandwich and a salad to have a little of both. Both were amazingly delicious! I got the Mediterranean Salad and the Italian sandwich. The salad had a variety of fresh and crisp veggies with a light dressing, while the sandwich was hot with oozing mozzarella over salami, ham and tomatoes. I totally forgot I was hungover as I enjoyed the rejuvenating meal, and was definitely careful not to eat so I wouldn't waste it :P  I rank this place up there with Ike's and Jersey Mike's, definitely worth a visit when you're in Vegas!",

Located in the Planet Hollywood (towards the front end of the strip), the hot sandwiches are so tasty!!!  The sandwiches doesn't look huge, but it gets very filling and I typically can't finish an entire sandwich on my own.   The chocolate chip and oatmeal cookies are really good as well.  The lines are usually super long, but it moves along super quickly and the service is fast and efficient.

Came in to grab lunch on a Wednesday afternoon a little after 2PM and there were 20 people ahead of us and only waited 5 minutes to order and a total of 20 minutes before stuffing my pie hole with a sammage.   Huge menu with specialty sandwiches, salads, soups and desserts hang on the wall. Order at the front and given a pager then walk down a line filled with tempting add-ons like chips, drinks and desserts before you reach the other end of the counter to pay. Classic display of adding sales.   Once you pay you wait until the pager lights up and vibrates which tells you the chow is ready.   Order for two sandwiches took 10 minutes. They are wrapped in gold foil paper and are toasty warm. We found a table and got down to business. I had the Caribbean jerk chicken sandwich which came on a white roll with banana peppers and roasted red peppers. Portion was average around 6 inches. It tasted okay and was filling.   Price can't be beat for Vegas $6.00 bucks each. It is like a quiznos sandwich. Nothing exciting nor fancy just an average sandwich.",

Had peppercinis and this spicy sauce on very moist chicken.  Went VERY well together!   Yum! Good place for some late night grubbing.  :)  PS don't share the sandwich. It won't be enough for two!

I like how it's just one pricing for all the sandwhiches and one pricing for the soups/salads. I've heard lots about this place, so I was excited to try it. It passed my food test. It tasted fresh and was warm and cheap. The flavors tasted good together. I got I believe the club. I will have to try others next time. Only thing was that they took a bit too long to make my sandwhich... maybe because of the time it took to make it hot? I would come here again though and next time, I think I also want to try the soups and salads.",

You may have gone to a club, you might have gambled, or maybe you just work late on the strip and are hungry.  The line will be long.  Very long.  But, they are a fine-tuned machine and will get to you very quickly.  So, don't be deterred.  It's a great sandwich, for a great price, especially considering you are on the strip.  BUT, maybe it's the morning.  EOS has EXCELLENT breakfast sandwiches.  They are very large, and even cheaper than the lunch/dinner options.    Overall, don't only look to this place when it's late and you've been out all night.  It's good for anytime, but I think its breakfast gets overlooked.  For the price, it's hard to get this much food and have it actually be good.",

    "text": "Finally, I found a place in Vegas that is a decent substitute for a hoagie from the Northeast.  A hoagie/sandwich is one of those things where the major components all add to the overall experience.  You can't just have one component carry the slack for the rest of the components.  A lot of times I'll find a place where the meats are great, but the bread is terrible or vice versa.  I had the Full Montague here.  The bread was fresh; it actually had a great crust and was chewy on the inside as well.  The right bread is the hardest thing to find in most places. The meat itself is top notch, and is just as good as Boar's Head branded meat, if it isn't actually Boar's Head.  I liked this place much better than Capriotti's; if you're a fan of hoagies from Philly or NY come here.   This place always seem to have a super long line whenever I walk past, but it seems to move quickly.  They have call ahead ordering and I recommend doing that to skip the line.  I'll definitely be back to try other sandwiches, and hope it's just as good as the Full Montague.",

Earl's has never disappointed me - other than the brutally long wait that occurs at literally the most random times of day. I think I've waited less at noon than around 3-4pm. But duh, it's vegas, and when in vegas, bedtime doesn't happen til 6am so of course, lunch will take place later. So I suggest go as early as physically possible.   The full montagu and caprese sandwiches are my favorites, but literally everything on the menu is delicious.  Considering the lengthy line, service here is quick. I mean, lightning fast. After you order, the wait is no longer than 7 minutes (oddly specific of me, but I'm serious) to get your food. Making the long wait that much more worth it.",

They do have a store at Downtown Disney, but for some reason when I ate there it didn't taste quite the same. I've tried the original (roast beef, cheddar, horseradish sauce), chipotle chicken avocado (pretty self explanatory) and Hawaiian BBQ (chicken, ham, Swiss, pineapple, BBQ sauce), and some of their breakfast sammiches. All of these are delicious but I kept coming back to my holiday turkey. True taste test was this weekend when I bought the sandwich for early dinner on Saturday, and had some leftover on Sunday morning. Our hotel didn't have a fridge nor microwave, so my leftover was just sitting out overnight. And it was still SO GOOD. Never had that happen with any other sandwich. They're open 24 hours and they're always busy, but I've gotten great customer service every time and never had a problem finding a seat.  Best deal on the Strip.

I've been here plenty of times and I loved their vegetarian sandwich that was stuffed with feta cheese, veggies, balsamic etc.  It was delicious! However, I remember going back and they had taken the sandwich off the menu. I was bummed and when I asked them for a different option, they said the only sandwich they had was the caprese.  I wasn't feeling it, and I asked if they would mind making me something else, they said they couldn't.  THAT MAKES NO SENSE. I just wanted a sandwich stuffed with veggies, cheese, etc. but they said that wasn't allowed.  I was so furious, considering I waited in such a long line and I was starving.   Coming here this past weekend.  I saw that they added another veggie option to their menu, I was stoked to try it, however when I arrived to the front of the line, the cashier said they had run out.  When I asked if they could make me something else, they once again denied this request.    I suggest they step up their service & offer more vegetarian options.   BTW the two stars are for their sandwich bread. Its just so good.",

    "text": "I'M SO SAD. Earl of Sandwich has definitely downgraded from the glory it used to be!  I came here on my last trip to Vegas, only to find out that Earl is now only a shadow of his former self.   Let me interject with some background history: I frequented Vegas when I lived in Southern California. When I say frequent, I mean at least once a month. I know Vegas like the back of my hand: I can tell you what hotels are located where, and what time each of the nightclubs' guestlists close. I was very familiar with Earl's menu. Drunkenly slurring out an order for the Earl's Cobb wrap, debating over the potato salad in the fridge, with my heels in hand at 4 am in the morning - that was my THING!  So on my most recent trip, I happily approached the cashier at Earl's, announcing that I would like to order the Earl Cobb Wrap. This was what I had been looking forward to all night, post-clubbing. Not squeezing myself into a dress, not enjoying the live DJ performing at a million or billion dollar club or whatever, but shoving Earl's in my face drunkenly after a night of dancing.   Then the cashier said the words that absolutely broke my heart: \"We don't have the Earl Cobb Wrap\".  I stared agape at him. The wrap that I had eaten loyally for 4 years straight on my every trip was GONE?! Just like that?!   I spent a while in disbelief, drunkenly lamenting my sadness to Mr.Cashier before reluctantly ordering a Chinese Chicken Wrap and making my way down the queue.   Walking through the line, I brightened up at the thought of at least getting my potato salad. I peered into the refridgerator. And my spirits plummetted once again. What was once a generous portion of potato salad (think 6 oz) was now 2-3 oz! The same applied for the yogurt parfait - it was half the size it used to be! And surprise surprise, the prices were still the same original prices.  By the time I get to the front cashier (where customers pay), I was one sad, drunken lady. I shook the potato salad in Mr. 2nd Cashier,'s face, demanding \"WHY! Why did you make this smaller? What happened!!\"  Mr. 2nd Cashier responded tonelessly (he was probably used to these reactions), \"Corporate happened.\"  When I received my wrap, instead of the wheat pita bread Earl's wraps used to use, it was some stupid flour tortilla. Dry and definitely did not soften the loss of my beloved Earl Cobb Wrap. Bleh.  And so, I shake my fist as I angrilly write this review. Darn you, Corporate, darn you! How dare you take away what was once magical about Earl of Sandwich!",

I asked for extra lettuce and tomatoes, but they were kinda skimpy on that. One thing I don't like is that they don't ask what toppings you want on your sandwich. I want me more veggies, goddarnittt!!! :-P But the sandwich was tasty. Good size for me, but I was surprised my boyfriend or any guy would be satiated by a sandwich this size.   My boyfriend enjoyed the Earl's Club so much he ordered it both times we went.  Second time, I got the tomato soup. OOooooo my god. It was savory yet sweet and creamy and piping hot. The croutons they put in there stay crisp on the inside, although I wish they didn't put the croutons in before you even open your soup.   Good price for Vegas and good taste. I'm joining the Earl's fans. Honestly wish I could have had it one last time before I left Vegas...",

I tried to keep my expectations in check, but a sandwich here still just tasted like a sandwich to me!  The Full Montagu was tasty enough, right-sized, and reasonably-priced (especially given the prime location on the Strip where the Planet Hollywood Casino meets the Miracle Mile shops).  They really know what they are doing, and have a thorough understanding of the science of sandwich-making.  However, I wasn't floored by the flavor, the bread, or anything else, really.  It's a solid choice for food (especially for Vegas-on-a-budget), but they need to do just a little more than be all-around above-average in order to earn it the coveted fifth-star.  Maybe a few more varieties of sandwiches may appeal to my tastes.  I'll definitely be back, though!",

I've written that on two restaurants from one trip and I'm starting to reconsider trusting yelp for Vegas finds... It feels like most of the reviews are swayed by the drunkenness of the situation. I ordered the original- the bread was good the mustard was good but the roast beef was impossible to eat. While I likes the thick cut of it it was hard to take a bite without pulling the remaining roast beef out of your sandwich... And since Earl's is an open restaurant you don't want the rest of vegas watching you struggle with a sandwich  I thought maybe I was the only one who felt that...but the other girls I ate with all thought it was overrated.  Overall, it's a good deal for vegas, but not worthy the hype.",

In case you've never been here before, you can just follow the long line of people- you order your soup, sandwiches, salads, or wraps at the first register and pick up extra goodies like cookies and pasta salad on the walk to the second register where you pay for everything.  You'll receive pager which will beep when your food's ready.  It can be hard to nab a table here during meal times but it's worth it.  I got a chicken salad here since I'm trying to get ready for swim season and it's just not the same as the sandwich.  The chicken is that refrigerated/packaged chicken strips which are kind of spongy and bland.  On the brighter side, the dressing was great and the other toppings like kalamata olives and roasted red peppers were great.  The bf was smart and got the full montegue.  We also ordered the original to go.  Any sandwich here is a must.  Don't try to get something healthier like my salad cuz it just isn't worth it.  and for all you lucky LA people... we will be getting one at Downtown Disney soon!!!",

The taste is great but they could pack it in more with meat but hey it still tasted great.  Their chicken noodle soup was fantastic. Potato salad was yummy and hit the spot.  I tried the original, BLT, and Caribbean jerk.. All were great.... even the next day cold it tasted awesome... Quality food right there. The line can get long but moves pretty well.  Its supposedly 24hrs but it was closed after 3am on a Friday night...weeeiird?  Maybe they had to clean and restock.  Either way great place to get a snack after the club or lunch run.",

I would definitely recommend the Original, the Earl Club and pretty much everything is good on the menu so you really cant go wrong!   I've also tried their cheddar soup which was delicious and their ice cream sandwich, also delicious! But of course the main attraction are the beautiful sandwiches wrapped in gold!",

    "text": "So for the past 2 Vegas trips, I made it a point to take my friends to Earl of Sandwich because it's sooooo good. Granted that it's only a sandwich shop, the food is served fresh, warm, and tastes pretty damn good!  Earl of Sandwich is located in Planet Hollywood and normally there's a line but it goes pretty fast. Line = good sign for a restaurant. You order first and then pay at the end of the line (then they give you a buzzer for when your food is ready). There's limited seating space so you'll have to have a few of your friends lurk around and snatch a seat. But the best thing about Earl of Sandwich is that it's open 24 hrs 7 days!!!  So far I've had the Caribbean Jerk Chicken - Grilled Chicken, Roasted Red & Banana Peppers & Spicy Jerk Sauce (there's a slight kick to it, but nothing no one can handle...and the roasted red/banana peppers gives the sandwich a nice smokey flavor)  and  The Earl's Club - Roasted Turkey, Smoked Bacon, Aged Swiss, Lettuce, Roma Tomatoes & Sandwich Sauce (I gobbled everything up...can't go wrong with bacon...IT'S BACON!)  I believe all the signature sandwiches are priced at $6.99...and that's an automatic win in Vegas (especially if you lost at the casino tables). You can add soups, chips, drinks, dessert, etc to your order as well but the sandwich is pretty filling - at about 6\".",

It felt like more of an panni then a full sandwich. But that all depends on your appetite. If I came back with a friend I would order 3 sandwich and split it between the two of us. I am still hungry. Now for the coleslaw.....that was a good coleslaw, it was sweet, creamy, and fresh. I love their coleslaw and will get it everytime I come here. Overall it was a good sandwich/panni with a great coleslaw. I would come back and try the other sandwiches.....you should too and see if it's worth it",

    "text": "Mmmmm Earl of Sandwich was the first thing I was craving when I woke up in Vegas. This restaurant is a little far from the Planet Hollywood parking structure so it is best if you enter from the Strip. The line is intimidating in the beginning, but it goes by pretty fast.   We decided to order the Earl Signature Sandwich, the Jerk Chicken Sandwich, the tomato soup with croutons, and the Frozen Lemonade. Both sandwiches were made in soft fluffy bread and came supplied with ample amounts of meat and ingredients. I feel you can't go wrong with any of their sandwiches. The Frozen Lemonade was a little too extreme and citrus-y for my liking. I loved the tomato soup with croutons; it wasn't bland or watered down. I might be a little bias since there were croutons and by default, I have a stronger liking toward all salads and soups that come with those little bread cubes :)",

All the sandwiches are made fresh once you've placed your order. You can see them making your sandwich while you wait in line to pay. Now, what sandwich to get? well, whatever you're craving for!! I've tried ALL the sandwiches, and I must say, all of them are damn good. There aren't any one that I can called my favorite but when I do go, I usually stand there trying to figure out what I'm in the mood for. And usually I end up with two or three sandwiches -.-'   There is a downfall to this greatness. the LINES! sometime the line stretches out far where you'll have to wait at least 30 minutes! but don't fear, I'll let you know a secret, CALL AHEAD! Look up the menu online, decide what you want and call to pick up your order! you skip the line and your food is hot and ready when you come pick it up!   so come on down to earls! :D  ps did i mention it's 24hrs?! so satisfy your drunk munchies with a quality bomb sandwich!",

    "text": "The Skinny: toasted sammy on a ciabatta bun with super fresh ingredients - what's not to like? (4), Service: it's a 24 hour counter service establishment. Given the reasonable price and quality, it's almost always inundated with people (3), Value: breakfast sandwiches for $3.99 and the other hot sandwiches for $5.99 - this place is a steal on the Strip (5).  We were super stoked that the Earl of Sandwich made it's way to the Strip. We first had Earl of Sandwich in Florida and instantly fell in love with the reasonable prices and solid food.  Unlike other places which toasted fully cooked bread, Earl of Sandwich's ciabatta bread comes probably 98% baked and leaves the remaining 2% for their toasting oven. That allows their bread to develop a lovely golden brown crispy crust on the outside while retaining a dense chewy texture on their inside. The robust little loaves really hold up to the fillings and sauces.  The ratio of bread to filling is perfect - not too much to overwhelm the bread but substantial enough to feel satisfied. The lettuce is green leaf cut in whole pieces which adds a nice textural contrast while the tomatoes are perfectly ripe. The meats are well-prepared and succulent, unlike the typical rubbery flavourless textures you might see at your regular fast food outlets. They usually add just the right amount of sauce to moisten the filling without making everything soggy.  Given the great prices and quality, this place can get pretty busy throughout the day unless you get here early in the morning. But it is definitely worth a stop for a nice satisfying budget meal. 4 stars.",

The only down side is that most of the time there is a long line, no matter what time of day you go. But the staff moves it along pretty well so the wait is never too long.",

It's open all the time, so when you get hungry after drinking and partying all night at the club, it'll be open and waiting for you (and actually still pretty packed).

It's a bit loud, but if you're in Vegas you probably don't care that much.  Also, the line might look long, but it moves pretty fast, so don't worry too much about it.

My other girlfriends ordered some of the other sandwiches like The Earl and Cannonball and they raved that those were just as yummy too.  One sandwich is pretty filling by itself but if you have room I'd also recommend their potato soup.  It's tasty and hearty and doesn't taste processed or canned like some soups I've tried at other sandwich places.  To top it off, their service is really quick too.  On our first visit, we called ahead to order 10 sandwiches and had only a short wait before our order was ready for us to pick up.  Even during the \"after club\" hours, we probably waited less than a minute before our order was ready.",

This one is in the Miracle Mile and is open 24hrs. It's hard to recommend a good time because it always looked like the line was long. We went Monday morning a little before 10 and amazingly the line was short - maybe 3 people ahead of us. Usually it's wrapped around the corner.  My hubby had the Jerk Chicken and I had the Earl Club. I didn't ask him too many questions because I was too busy stuffin' my face.   The bread they used was amazing. From the looks of it I thought it would be harder but it wasn't. The bread melts in your mouth and is perfect. If I could order just the fresh bread I would. Delish!  The sandwich was perfect and like I said the bread was amazing. I recommend and will definitely come back again.",

I had finally gotten the chance to last week and I have to say it was pretty good, but I had better sandwiches. I ordered the Full Montagu. Everything was jammed packed into every bite. Even though it doesn't look like the picture on the website it still is pretty delicious. The roast beef and turkey goes well with swiss and cheddar. And the mustard compliments everything all together. Even though there was a long line and it was very busy, our sandwich came out pretty quick.   This is a must go if you are in Vegas and haven't tried it before.",

I waited in line for 25minutes for the sandwiches with high expectations. Instead, I was still hungry after eating the sandwich and grumpty for having to wait that long for something not so amazing. What was I thinking?!  I'm giving them two stars for their soft, delicious bread. However, if you don't like your bread being a little oily, you may not like it. You can definitely get better sandwiches at other local sandwich shops in Vegas. Definitely over hyped. You can definitely go if the line is short, but honestly don't wait in line.

Tucked away in two slices of super crispy bread, wrapped in gold wrapper.  Yuppp, this is what Earl of Sandwich will dish out to you if you find that you have somehow discovered this sandwich place!   Earl of Sandwich has been on the target sandwich place for a few years now, it's hard to imagine anyone who hasn't tried this place yet -- but if you haven't, I really hope you will after reading all the great reviews.   I'm not sure why there would be any poor reviews for this place -- whether overhyped or not, a delicious sandwich is a delicious sandwich!!   Surprisingly no line when I went around 3pm! In the past there was always a line no matter what time of day I went. Service was quick and friendly! For anyone who is curious: the cashier I spoke to told me the chipotle Chicken Avocado Sandwich is their best seller and the Full Montague sandwich is their second best. I've ordered both in the past and they're both REALLY good. The soup was tasty as well and worth trying if you're wanting soup (:  Too bad breakfast sandwiches are served only during their breakfast hours -- I really wanted to try them!",

    "text": "In my view, yet another overhyped restaurant. Earl of Sandwich is a glorified Subway.   The Food: The chips are greasy and not particularly special. The chicken tortilla soup is pretty standard, the kind of soup you'd expect at your local Panera Bread. The chicken mac'n'cheese was actually quite delicious, with a crunchy texture owing to the crumbs they throw on top (mmm mmm mmmm). And the sandwich itself? Nothing special. I got the chipotle avocado chicken sandwich: The bread was whatever-white-bread, the chicken seemed ok, but not explosive, and the big chunks of avocado were pretty good and fresh.   Price: Dirt cheap. Under $7 for a sandwich. I understand for the price it may be decent enough. But this is not nearly as good as Ike's in San Francisco.   Overall, this may be a good place to check out if you and the squad are nursing a hangover on a Sunday morning, but I wouldn't go here otherwise. Also, the lines can apparently get pretty huge.  In the near future, I expect this place to explode into a national chain, losing whatever little cache it had in Vegas as a stop-over spot for hungover peeps.",

My friend and I walked to Planet Hollywood from the MGM simply for lunch at Earl of Sandwich. While waiting in line, I perused the menu and decided to try the Full Montagu (subbing extra turkey for the roast beef). The warm bread, turkey, cheese (Swiss and cheddar), lettuce and tomato were all fresh and complemented each other perfectly. The \"mustard sauce\" that comes on the sandwich seemed a little too sweet (perhaps honey mustard) so I added a bit of dijon from the table and it added the right amount of kick. I'm not usually one to eat my entire meal in one sitting but it was so tasty that I couldn't put it down (plus, my room didn't have a fridge so I didn't have much choice...no way I was throwing this out!).   At $6.50, the price was very reasonable, especially for a spot on the Strip in Vegas. I added a bag of chips to my order for $1.25 (also a great price!.   While the restaurant looked crowded, they are very efficient at moving the line through quickly. Order at the first stop, pay at the second and then you receive a beeper for when you're sandwich is ready for pick up.   Only downside is that the closest Earl of Sandwich is in Anaheim at Downtown Disney. But on the plus side, I have a Disney pass and hope to stop by on my next trip north!",

I have never ate a tuna sandwich as good as this place! I also tried the mediterranean salad, it was average. And the tomato soup was alright also. Definitely would come back here again!

I wasn't sure of what to get, so I just ordered The Original--roast beef with sharp cheddar & creamy horseradish sauce. It turned out to be the right choice! The horseradish nicely complemented the roast beef, and the bread was nicely toasted.  I'll be sure to stop by here again when I want some quick, tasty food without overspending.",

Let's be honest here, you really need Earl of Sandwich. It's to die for, it's absolutely amazing, and that chipotle chicken man..............  But the only reason why I'm giving it 4 out of 5 stars is because although it's pretty cheap, that's the downfall. It's cheap, so the lines go so far out, you're literally watching that Deal or No Deal game for 45 minutes before you can order.",

Plus you're in Vegas at the shops, so there are tons of things you can do while waiting for your food, though it doesn't take long at all.  Some of my faves: - Chipotle Chicken Avocado: tender chicken, fresh avocado and tangy/mild chipotle sauce - Caribbean Jerk: Too drunk to remember... but it was gooooood - Holiday Turkey: One of the specials you can only get around the holiday season I believe. It has thin-sliced turkey, cranberry sauce and gravy! OMG.  I love eating here because it's an affordable option other than eating at buffets plus they're open 24 hours. A tip would be to call in your order as you're headed over so your food will be ready by the time you arrive to pick it up.",

    "text": "God I love this place. Ever since I turned 21 back in 2009, I have been enjoying this eatery in the Planet Hollywood Hotel and Casino. Ironically, the first place I stayed at in Las Vegas was at the PH and I got to enjoy this place up to 3 times during a weekend trip....  Okay the star missing is because of their \"factory-like\" mechanical processing of their sandwiches now that they have 1100+ reviews and hundreds of hungry, drunk people wanting their food everyday. Hey, they're open 24 hours, so I understand their concern to be quick... but at the same time they are affecting their quality.  In 2009/2010, I could enjoy multiple sandwiches that were fluffy and not mashed together by the server. Maybe I'm just bitter or maybe I glorified those first few sandwiches, but I don't think Earl will ever be the same. It's still worth the $6 for each sandwich compared to some pricey, fast-casual eateries on the strip, but I'd rather just go to the Monte Carlo Food Court and grab a McDonald's sandwich or Subway instead for less.  If you're staying in PH, stay alert for the coupons as well. The location, btw, is at the entryway of their shops right off the strip.",

If you are looking for cheap but good food and you aren't really feeling like eating McDonalds go to Earl and check them out.  The sandwich is quite filling and if you aren't really a big eater than I would suggest sharing it with another girlfriend. Everyone seems to like this place a lot and the line can be massive.   If you aren't a fan of sandwiches than you might not like this place. The desserts are a little bit on the sweet side and not really my taste.   But if you do need to eat an  your on a budget I would definitely go here and try it out, if you haven't already!",

These sandwiches are truly some of the most flavorful I've ever had.  Presentation is awesome, great variety of healthy options here and a lot of fun side/dessert items.  I did feel the pricing for the sandwiches is a little high as they aren't large sandwiches, but you pay nearly $7 for them.  I can get a foot long at Subway for $5, but the taste of the sandwiches makes up for the cost and are probably proportionate portion sizes for what we should all eat for a sandwich.

It is actually pretty heavy eating since most of their sandwiches are cheesy, and this is after I said \"hold the mayo\".  It's $5.99 plus tax and they are open late. Those are the only pluses.

They also have seasonal items for the winter such as macaroni and cheese, which we did not get to try and the Chicken Promodoro, which had this amazing pesto on it.

I really like the chipotle chicken avocado but you can't really go wrong with anything on the menu. They also have specials every so often which are only during a certain holiday but usually super delicious!

The Full Montagu has turkey, roast beef and is held together very nicely by cheese and it's fantastic toasted bread.  The tomato soup will warm your soul after losing Jr.'s college fund on the Baccarat table. It's like Spaghetti-O's minus the O's, which I am fond of.  They throw croutons in there to sweeten the deal.  Luckily, I had not yet began binge drinking and was able to read up on some world history.  This Earl dude (maybe his name was John), invented the sandwich during a card game in jolly old England. I always thought the sandwich was an American invention.  It's Brit.  Damn you, history.  Damn you for opening my eyes to the truth.  And now for your sandwich tip (yeah baby, tip) of the day.  Their HP steak sauce would make anything better.  If you douse your TV with it, it might stop you from putting your foot through your LCD when Oprah is on.  By the way, it's Canadian.  Have you noticed how our friend, the sandwich has been hiding behind a wall of deceit?  Perhaps it's all for the best that there aren't many Earl of Sandwiches around.  I wouldn't want Billy Bob's world to implode when he finds out that his fried bologna sandwich on crust-less off brand bread came from overseas.  <a href=\"http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/DkYS3arLOhA8si5uUEmHOw?select=f87flydbA6bnMIEZXqQuww\">yelp.com/biz_photos/DkYS...</a>  Now.

    "text": "Any restaurant with 4.5 Stars after hundreds of ratings is going to attract my attention.  Today was the day I went to give this place a shot.  I took my son along.  We decided that we were going to order an Original Sandwich & an Italian Sandwich.....that we we could split each of them and give them both a try.  When we arrived, the place was packed.  However, this restaurant knows how to handle volume.  The ordering & payment process was smooth.  I was surprised to see the selection of Chips, Fruit, Beer & Wine, and Muffins & Pastries that were available.  We found a 2 Top table and waited for our number to be buzzed.  After about 10 minutes, our pager buzzed and I went to pick up our order.  The Sandwiches are hot & toasted.  I eagerly bit into the Original Sandwich (Roast Beef, Cheddar Cheese, & Creamy Horseradish Sauce).  The Bread was toasted just right and the Roast Beef was tender, it melted in my mouth.  The bite of the Cheddar Cheese & Creamy Horseradish went very well with the meat & bread.....it was like heaven!  I couldn't get enough.....I wish I ordered a full sandwich.  So, I couldn't wait to eat my half of the Italian (Salami, Capicola, Roasted Ham, Mortadella, Mozzarella Cheese, Roma Tomato, and Zesty Italian Dressing).....again, it was toasted just right.  This sandwich also burst with flavor on my taste buds......oh man, I think I hit the jackpot!!!  This place was off the hook!  For once, a restaurant lived up to the hype!  5 Stars in my book.  The only knock for me is that it is very inconvenient for a local to get in/out of Planet Hollywood just to get a sandwich.  Will I come back?  Abso-freakin'-lutely!",

My recommendations: The original sandwhich- especially if you love horseradish mediterranean salad tomato soup (the crouton are delicious and crunchy)",

I wouldn't say it was as spectacular as others have raved, but that didn't stop me from eating it three times during my stay in Vegas.  The comments about the service are spot on, whoever is running this place obviously doesn't know the meaning of customer service, or just doesn't care that the service is rude, unfriendly, and completely uncaring about the customer's experience. I would think a restaurant on the strip in Vegas would be ready for a high turnover of new business and train staff to welcome new guests and help them through the process, this was a complete fail. I was not welcomed as I arrived during any of the three visits, the staff didn't waste a single friendly or helpful word beyond what was absolutely necessary to complete the transaction, and I don't remember a single thank you for my patronage.  I would recommend going, but save a buck and keep the tip for yourself, unless management/staff get their act together.  Altogether a mediocre sandwich and bad service, but the price is good.",

The bread is amazing and toasted to perfection! After seeing that this place had thousands of yelp reviews (which is super rare) I decided to see for myself. When we arrived around 1pm on Sunday, there was a line but it moved super quickly. The people that work here are definitely prepared for large crowds and are really efficient.   I highly recommend the Caribbean Jerk Chicken - the banana peppers give it a slight kick and the jerk mayo makes the sandwich juicy and delicious. The grilled chicken was moist and flavorful. The sandwich doesn't come with cheese so I added cheddar cheese for $.50 and it was really worth it. It was hot and melted too yummm I want to go to Vegas right now to have another one of these!  They cut their sandwiches right down the middle so if you can't decide... you and your friend can get two different ones and just split it. It's open late too so perfect for a snack after going out!",

Plenty of bread, of course, but unfortunately, like all chain sandwich joints, there was only a tiny bit of meat and cheese.  In fact, when I opened the wrapper there was no filler visible at all - my sandwich simply looked like a loaf of bread.  Only by peering at the cut end could I discern the miniscule serving of beef.  Even Subway (which does not taste as good) does better when it comes to quantity of filling.  And of course it goes without saying that the sandwich looked nothing at all like the photos on the menu, with their hearty portions.  Not recommended unless you fancy paying $8 for a small loaf of bread.  Otherwise, the service was good and the restaurant was clean.",

I personally enjoyed ikes(in sf) a lot more.  There are definitely some good points about this place. One of the best thing about it is that it opens 24 hrs and thats a major plus for me. I enjoyed the fact that this place opens 24 hrs :). Anyway I'm not gonna lie but this place is pretty good.   Im just saying i would say this would be my 2nd favorite sandwich place. Although I must say that the bread in Earl is a lot better than the one they have in ikes. I enjoyed the fact that their bread is hot and crispy. That is one reason why I do like this place. The price is pretty decent. It is around $6 but i need like 1 sandwich + 1/2 sandwich to really get me full.   It is definitely worth a try if you live around planet hollywood or if you are hungry in the middle of the night then it is a nice place to try out.",

I'd have to say that considering 90% of my visits here have been late night, after clubbing, hot mess, need to sober up and soak up all the alcohol visits, I perhaps need to give it a go in more normal circumstances. I mean, yes they were deeelicious, but anything is delicious under the above mentioned conditions.   I love the fact that they are 24 hours, and surprisingly there are always people there. My only wish for the sandwiches at Earl is that they were bigger.",

    "text": "This is actually a tricky place to review. On the one hand the All American is hands down my favorite sandwich in town (even better than the Bobbie at Capriotti's IMO), but the other sandwiches at Earls are really lacking. So basically for the All American alone I'd give Earl 5 stars, but since that's really the only sandwich my bf and I have liked here, I'd have to drop it a 4.  The All American is the perfect mix of tangy, savory and sweet and the bread is always perfectly toasted. I'm getting so hungry just writing this review!  Do be prepared for a loooong wait if you go during peak or near peak times. Also if you're local, the drive, park and long walk to get to Earl is a chore and has kept us from going more often.  I was really happy to find out that there is another location at the Palms (easier to get to), but I was thoroughly disappointed when we went. The ingredients were not as fresh and service was non-existent. It was like going to a completely different restaurant.and we wouldn't go back again.",

I looked at him skeptically: really, thats your best advice, go get a sandwich?   Silly me to doubt his judgement. EoS is high-level grub at a reasonable price.  What they get, and what most sandwich places don't get, is the fact that bread matters. You can ruin the flavors and combinations on a sandwich by using bread thats tasteless or tough. The bread at Earls, though, is awesome. Strong enough to hold its contents, but not too chewy.   My family ended up splitting six sandwiches for lunch, all of which were great but the Tuna Melt in particular was outstanding. The wife and I snuck back to Earl late that evening, after the kids had gone to bed and it was time for grown up fun. And we bought enough to take on the ride home back to LA.",

When you find yourself in Vegas, there are lots of options and plenty of tourist traps waiting to inhale your wallet. Fortunately, the Earl of Sandwich stands ready to relieve you of your overspending woes.  Now, the value isn't super incredible: You're still paying ~Chipotle pricing for a smaller sandwich, but think of it like the Snickers fun-sized version of a Subway sub. It's more compact but still full of meat and sauce and cheese. I got to try the  Montegu and the 1762 Original. Both were good, but I think I preferred the horseradish flavor of the 1762 (big horseradish fan, I am).  The ciabatta-like bread was nicely crunchy but soft (I think similar to Schlotzky's?) and full of flavor. The ratio of bread to meat to cheese/sauce was good on both where no one element of the sandwich was overpowering. Overall, very satisfying.",

For $6.99, this is THE place to go in Vegas for a fast, satisfying meal (or post clubbing snack), especially if you're saving up $$ for the next club or ya lost it gambling. While the line was long during the lunch hour rush, it moved along quite quickly!  The menu is simple, and you have the option of white or wheat for your sandwich. They toast the bread so that it's crunchy but still soft, just the way I like it. I tried both the Chicken Chipotle Avocado sandwich and the Full Montague. Although both were delicious, I personally preferred the former because it had avocados in it (yum). Flavors were very well balanced, and left me feeling very satisfied. My friend, a self proclaimed Mac n Cheese connoisseur, gave their Mac n Cheese (hello, only $3.99 for a full non-kidsized serving) a huge thumbs up.",

When I found out there was one open 24 hours just a 5 minute away from the MGM Signature, I knew I had to give them a try.   The night we landed, a friend and I headed over at about 12am for a quick bite to eat - we both had early evening flights and were super hungry. I had the \"American\", which was really good. I liked the contrast between the cranberry sauce and the ranch dressing. Sandwiches came out quick and the combo add-on with a drink + chips for $2.99 is super fair.   We came back as a full group on our last full day in Vegas (we woke up way too late and had a very late lunch). I tried their Thanksgiving dinner inspired sandwich and really loved it. The mixture of cranberry sauce, gravy, stuffing, and turkey really hit the spot.   Highly Recommended!!",

That's where this spot comes into play. Everything is priced well and it stays open 24 hours for you when you need to soak up some of the liquor. I have tried multiple things here, but the two sandwiches that stand out are the Philly Cheese and the Club. Can't miss with either.",

First impression: LONGGGG line that moves pretty quickly, little seating area where you have to stalk people to find a seat (but I'm a great stalker so that was no problem! Hahha I kid... ) Pretty clean place!  Sandwiches tried:  Moi= the full montagu thanks to the multiple yelp recommendation. Tis was good. Just good. The bf= (limited edition) chipotle chicken avocado. GREAT delicious sandwich! I was doubting him because I couldn't find it on any yelp reviews... but it is because they only offer this little piece of heaven once in a while. I regret not buying another one for the ride back. The avocado and the chipotle sauce go so well together. MM MMM MMM  Tip: have your companion get in line and get the sandwich for you while you stalk people for seats ;) It doesn't take that long to find a seat actually! Come here for some quick and affordable food, then walk to Fat Tuesday to get some alcoholic slushies to wash it all down!",

My friend raved about the tomato soup but I thought I had better. The sandwich was good, but I didn't see the big deal on JUST a sandwich.i mean seriously, it's just a sandwich.

Wow, was my mind and taste buds BLOWN AWAY!  First I want to say that YES there will probably be a line when you're waiting here and the technique is to have your partner grab a table while you wait in line to order.  That's the key to getting a spot to eat!   The wait really isn't that bad (10-15 mins) because they really do try their best to service their customers quickly.  I ordered the Mediterranean Chicken Salad (dressing on the side) both times I went here and I was not disappointed.  The tomato soup was DELICIOUS as well (although small).    My husband ordered the ham and Swiss sandwich (yummy) on the first visit and the Mediterranean tuna wrap the second time. He said both were delicious but was partial to the to tuna wrap because it had more of a crunch and left him filled longer.  Overall, I LOVE THIS PLACE! Next time I'm in Vegas I will be coming here!!!",

This time I ordered the Chipotle Chicken Avocado which has grilled chicken, chipotle sauce (which I substituted for ranch), avocado, cheddar cheese, bacon, and lettuce. I recommend trying this sandwich because it is only available for a limited time.   My 4 star rating is because all of the flavors are there and the service is fast, but I have had better sandwiches.

The ones that are high on my list are:   Tuna Melt Earl's Club Italian Full Montagu  The line and wait time isn't bad and their sandwiches run around $6.99 each.  When you get to the first counter, you tell the person what sandwich you want to order, and they give you a buzzer and receipt to be rung up at the cashier at the end of the line. Then you walk past the chips, fruits, cookies, drinks, and temptation until you reach the end cashier. That is where you will pay for your sandwich and either purchase a drink or ask for a water cup ;). Then you find a seat and wait until you buzzer goes off indicating your food is ready to be eaten!  Very affordable and will definitely satisfy those cravings.",

I personally don't have cravings for this place when I'm in Vegas, but I can understand why people do. It's 2am:  you're drunk and hungry and want something quick and dirty. Well, not so dirty... They have wraps, soups, potato chips, sandwiches.... I've only had their sandwiches, which are on the pricier side of the spectrum (for a sammy- I think prices have gone up recently). For Vegas- it's cheap! The bread is what makes Earl's so very different. It's thick, cut into two separate pieces and tastes like a cross between an english muffin and cibatta. Or maybe it's a straight up cibatta roll. Highly suggest you try them at least once!",

For this Vegas trip, we stayed at Planet Hollywood, so it was very convenient for us to come here to order and bring it back to the hotel. That was exactly what we did, and it made our dinner plans quick and easy after a four hour drive from Los Angeles. The line moves quickly and you are given a buzzer after you pay for the order.   They have plenty of different sandwiches to choose from, but my favorites would be the Chipotle Chicken Avocado, Hawaiian BBQ, and the Earl's Club. It's around $7.49 for a sandwich, which is cheap for Vegas. The sandwiches are sliced into two and they're decently sized for a meal. The other items on the menu also sound good, especially the breakfast sandwiches, but I didn't get the chance to give them a try. Hopefully the next time i'm in Vegas, I can!",

I saw an ad, on the elevator TVs, for the Thanksgiving sandwich, and knew we had to give it a shot. I've seen these and their ilk on food network for years, and it was time to take the turkey plunge.  Good goddamn sandwich! Cranberry and taters were on point. Turkey is turkey 92% of the time, and this was no exception. We discussed, at the time, the idea of adding a green bean casserole component, but (possibly incorrectly) adjudicated it to be superfluous. My only real complaint is that they used a cornbread (and not crouton) based stuffing, but whatevz. Good sandwich, y'all!",

Sweet, tangy Chipotle sauce. Overall, very flavorful and filling.  Thai Chicken Wrap $6.99- my mom seemed to like her wrap. It was also pretty big  No line but we came at 330pm on a Wednesday.",

WRONG.  I find myself struggling to look for food on the strip at 2am. Pinup pizza is already closed. Walking anywhere would be such a hassle. Thank god for Earl's.  I first had Earl's back in 2014 at Downtown Disney in Anaheim. They recently opened one in San Jose(hometown), but it seriously not the same.  Is it because I am drunk?! Or is it really good? I always stick to my classic tuna melt every time I come here.  I love that the service is so quick and easy. You know how people get when they're tired and hungry... Not pretty. If you're not a fan of tuna, don't fear! As there are other options! The Holiday turkey sandwich isn't bad. A fan favorite is the chicken chipotle avocado. The Earl's club is going to be your most classic sandwich of them all. The original 1762 is a must for roasted beef lovers.  Not a fan of sandwiches? That's okay too. They have breakfast items as well as wraps, salads and soups. I've heard of people complaining about the size of the sandwich, but for $7-$8, what more can you ask for. PLUS, YOU'RE IN VEGAS!",

I got the Caprese sandwich which was good, a bit too buttery for my taste (but most people like that) but the cheese was very good and they didn't skimp on it, the basil was fresh and the balsamic sauce was yummy. The place was hoppin so I guess everything else is good too!",

Just the right amount of sauce and juice gushes to your mouth to fill your mouth with orgasmic pleasure. I traded half of mine with a friend for a roast beef one and it was still good. After I was done, I told myself that I needed to come back before I go to grab a sandwich for the flight home.  So, I stumbled in around 5am to grab a sandwich for my journey home. Didn't get hungry till I was actually home and the sandwich was still good.",

It's so good that you can have it for every meal. Yes. Go to earls and get this. Earls is open about 24 hours a day I think. If you don't like Tuna, everything else is probably good too like the Club sandwich. The soups are good too with the meal if you want variety. Chicken Noodle is always good after drinking or whatever. The broccoli and cheese is good. The tomato soup is super delicious with the Tuna melt!!!!!! I'm drooling just writing about. Check it out if you have those late night munchies yesss.",

    "text": "Finally after my girlfriend talking this place up for the last several months I had the privilege of trying the legend that is Earl of Sandwich or more commonly known as \"Earl's.\"   I honestly did not want to get my hopes up about this place because like I've mentioned before when it comes to food I'm too pretentious and stubborn to believe an opinion about food other than my own :p  I was so impressed by this place not just by the taste but the price, quantity, quality of food and the BREAD...yes the BREAD. They make their own artisan bread and it's one of the best sandwich breads I've ever tasted. Crispy outside, soft on the inside however biting through it, the textures come together and it's yeast n flour filled divinity.  I bought the BEST BLT for myself but my friends and I shared with each other so I sampled 4 different sandwiches including mine: Hawaiian BBQ, Cannonballs!, The Full Montagu and mine the BEST BLT.  Hawaiian BBQ: sweet and savory just like anything \"Hawaiian\" but with BBQ sauce and pineapple and a generous serving of ham. Cannonballs!: a meatball sandwich that won't fall apart on you. Solidly constructed with Parmesan and chewy melted Mozzarella makes an excellent sandwich The Full Montagu: the reason this is a 4 star instead of a 5 star review, wasn't that impressed just tasted like a regular roast beef sandwich but still good BEST BLT: Lives up to its name! Most BLT's is a couple of strips of bacon that you pull out with one bite and all your bacon is gone. This BLT sandwich is filled with bacon bits throughout and is a must for anyone who enjoys this classic sandwich.  Earl's definitely lived up to the hype and is a must-go on my Vegas trips from now until eternity and maybe a little bit after that too :p.",

See here, I'm super picky with sandwiches, and find myself over them by the 3rd bite. But with this hunk of morsels, I didn't want the love to end, especially since unrequited love is hard to swallow!  The succulent Albacore tuna (w/no fishy smell) is so fluffy as it's bathed in rich mayo, melted w/savory swiss cheese, and built between a fresh, buttery artisan loaf.  Tastes exquisite even after a 4 hour drive, fridged for 10 hours, and re-heated. It will make you CRY.

A trip planned around a sandwich shop.   I don't think I need to go into any more detail, but for the sake of a solid yelp review here it goes. Every sandwich is incredible but the Holiday Turkey will forever be my favorite. In one weekend, I ate five of them and I have no regrets. Even though that's my favorite, everything on the menu is delicious. I've also tried the soups and they're great to dip your sandwiches into as well.   Moral of the story: this restaurant is the best thing to exist in Las Vegas and if you don't get a sandwich here you aren't truly living.   Oh and they're open 24 hours so post day or night club sandwiches are a must!",

Long SUBWAY type make-line, big dining area.  ========= THE SUBS =========  ~ EARL'S CLUB - Turkey, bacon, Swiss, sandwich sauce, lettuce & tomato. This was really amazing and out of the 5+ sandwiches I've tried... it was definitely the best. (5/5)  ~ CHIPOTLE CHICKEN AVOCADO - Grilled chicken, bacon, sharp cheddar, avocado, lettuce & chipotle sauce. I tried this my first time there back in December. The FULL MONTAGUE was disappointing and while sitting there I saw this had avocado, chipotle sauce and bacon... some of my favorite things. It was really good. (4/5)  ~ ITALIAN - Salami, capicola, roasted ham, mortadella, mozzarella, tomato & Italian dressing. This looks pretty simple and there's not of a \"sandwich\" taste since there's not many veggies... but the meats and cheese a delicious. Fattening but delicious. (4/5)  <a href=\"http://www.yelp.com/user_local_photos?select=Gtr6DZwXXssXth-mQBiekg&userid=1pgT-Eeh-GIOlhOgHMMRZA\">yelp.com/user_local_phot...</a>  ~ CHICKEN PESTO POMODORO - Grilled chicken, Swiss cheese, tomato, basil pesto and basil leaves. It was a WINTER SEASONAL limited time advertised sub when I went in April of 2013. It was pretty good. (4/5)  <a href=\"http://www.yelp.com/user_local_photos?select=MN3CVnevnkfo0GryLNjunQ&userid=1pgT-Eeh-GIOlhOgHMMRZA\">yelp.com/user_local_phot...</a>  ~ THE FULL MONTAGUE - Roasted beef, turkey, Swiss, sharp cheddar, lettuce, tomato & mustard sauce. According to YELP, this was their best sandwich. It was good, but just not really for me. (3/5)  ~ BROWNIE - This was pretty subpar. It was a brownie. Not good, not terrible... not worth it. (2/5)  ~ CHOCOLATE CHIP COOKIE -  It was pretty disgusting. Took one bite, putrid. Tried a second bite... tossed it. (1/5)  =============== FINAL THOUGHTS ===============  All-in-all this place is a 3 STARS. The subs are good but only 6-inches and for $6-each... it's a bit pricey. HOWEVER it's Vegas where $6.00 is a deal... so it gets a bonus point for that. All of their sandwiches are pretty good, haven't had a bad one yet. Plus all their sandwiches are hot ones. Do I prefer SUBWAY over this place. Sure... but it's still pretty good.  Last off stay away from the sides / snacks, they're terrible. And $6 for a 12oz bottle of Blue Moon? Walk down about 100 yards to the store that sells the souvenirs and alcohol and you can get a 22oz GIANT Blue Moon for $3.50.  --------------------------- *EDIT -  Next time I'm in Vegas I need to try... THE CARRIBEAN JERK CHICKEN and THE ORIGINAL 1762.",

I kept hearing about it, and on every trip through the Miracle Mile Shops I witnessed the long, long lines at Earl of Sandwich. I discovered last year that they actually have a location in Downtown Disney, but I didn't go and held out for Vegas. I'm glad I did!  I got really lucky and found that EoS had a Groupon deal - $5 for $10 worth of food, which is awesome! So the whole group got one, and we hit up EoS on a Saturday evening. It wasn't very crowded, and the line moved fast anyway. I got the chicken tortilla soup and chipotle chicken sandwich..both delicious, and just $10 total for an extremely tasty, satisfying meal right in the middle of the Strip (Really just $5 thanks to Groupon, but $10 would have been more than worth it!).   My friends all liked their food too. I'll find myself craving these sandwiches! Luckily, there's one in Valley Center and Anaheim isn't too far away.",

I thought it would be average but my girlfriend wanted to try some so I decided to try their sandwiches. I am glad I got a chance to try their wonderful sandwiches.Their sandwich was up there with my cravings for burgers. Their sandwiches are so simple yet packed with wonderful flavors and condiments. Probably the best sandwich place I have tried at the moment and I would definitely come here again.  Extremely affordable and something tasty you can grab quickly if you need to get somewhere.",

Each sandwich is only $5.99.  It is open 24 hours.  And it is RIDONKULOUSLY good.  Seriously.  I'm not joking around - if you are anywhere near PH, you MUST give this place a try.  If you like sandwiches in general, or hot sandwiches specifically, or just delicious bread - you won't go wrong.  The one sandwich our group didn't like was the Hawaiian...they said it was sort of sour.  The faves were probably the full montague & the italian.  YUM YUM YUM!!!",

The ingredients were nice and fresh, but I felt like my sandwich was so flat and unfulfilled. I was just hungry and wanted something to hit the spot! It filled me up, but in no way did it hit my spot. =(  The good thing is that the long line went pretty quick. After I ordered, my sandwich was done in like 5 minutes!

I tried the following Sandwiches:  Thanksgiving Special Turkey Sandwich with stuffing, gravy and cranberry sauce. This gangsta was so good I think I'm just going to come to Vegas next Thanksgiving and eating at Earl! Wow... it was like a whole Thanksgiving meal inside the most delicious bread. I'm serious about Thanksgiving 2011 at Earl!   The Original - Pretty normal sandwich but still very good quality. Must be the bread that is giving these bad boys such great quality.   Spicy Chicken - This was my favorite! The peppers are fresh and spicy mixed in with the delicious creamy chicken and then the bread again. What a sandwich!   Now I eat sandwiches at Vons or Subway quite often during work lunches and I only eat half a sandwich since a half fills me up. When I ate at Earl I ate the entire thing with no problem.

It's cheap, filling, and extremely good!  I went to Las Vegas this past month and tried earl of sandwich for my very first time. I can't believe I was missing out on such an amazing sandwich!   Before I thought, \"it's just a sandwich\", I mean  how good can a sandwich possibly get? This, my dear, is as good as it gets. I'm sure this place steals pieces of heaven to put in their sandwich.   I've only gone here twice throughout the duration of my stay in Vegas and the sandwiches I tried were the Earl's Club and the Full Montagu. These are both winners in my book.   I don't know how they do it but they put just the right amount of everything in these sandwiches. At first I thought the meat makes the sandwich or maybe a secret sauce but now I'm positive it's all in the bread. I may be mistaken but I think I had read somewhere that they don't bake the bread until you order it. Is it possible to bake bread that quickly?   Whatever their secret is, it definitely works and is well worth any wait you may experience. (I didn't have to wait long but I've heard the lines get pretty long).",

Fun Fact: Earl is a rank and Sandwich is a town in the UK; the word sandwich is actually named after its creator, John Montagu, the 4th Earl of Sandwich.  Haven't gotten around to trying all the sides (heard from friends they are good though), but the three sandwiches I tried were all excellent.  Sandwiches come out hot and are all made to order for only $5.99.  A deal anywhere including Vega$.  The toasted artisan bread combined with fresh ingredients make for tasty bite after tasty bite.  The Original is roasted beef, cheddar cheese and their own creamy horseradish sauce.  The roast beef tastes juicy and the horseradish sauce has a great tangy, not too hot combination.  The Italian is fresh tasting with juicy, ripe tomatoes and chunks of mozzarella cheese.  The Italian dressing adds a nice zest to the salamis and ham.  The Cannonballs! is your hearty meatball sandwich done right.  Go here for lunch, early dinner, midnight snack, or even 5am drunkies feeding as this place stays open 24 hrs.",

I got my sandwhich surprisingly quickly; way faster than at Subways. When I sat down to eat it though, I discovered I had a hair in my sammy. EWWWW! The workers there don't wear hair nets.  Grossed out, I walked over to the cash register and asked for a replacement. They were busy, but very nice about it, and got my another one very quickly.  The bread was cruchy and soft at the same time, and I thought that was definitely the highlight of the meal. The BBQ sause was entirely way too salty. They were kind of skimpy on the chicken. However I thought it was a good sandwich overall, I liked how the pineapple, ham, and the sauce worked together and the crunchy bread gave it texture.  I only came here cause I was in Vegas and there aren't THAT many cheap easy fast options. I wouldn't go back to this place out side of the whole hungover Vegas situation.",

Luckily for me, I stayed in the Westgate Towers at Planet Hollywood so we were only a stone's throw away from Earl's. Among my group of friends, I bet we hit this place up at least 5 times a day. My favorite is the club sandwich. The bread, ingredients, and special sandwich sauce they put in all meld together perfectly. Their chicken caesar salad is also delicious (croutons were on the salty side but no matter). Yes, the line can get long but it goes by really fast. Clubs, gambling, and other shenanigans are fun but Earl's is definitely gonna be my reason for returning to Vegas.",

The worker who took my order was incredibly rude. I've never been there before and asked a question about the spreads and she snapped at me. When done with my order she shoved the buzzer in my hand....like sheesh calm down. When my husband picked up the sandwiches I laughed. I paid over $15 for two small sandwiches. My sandwich had barely any meat. I must admit it was tasty but not very filling at all. Also I understand workers got to be near by for their breaks/lunches, but two lady workers were sitting gossiping (swearing up a storm) well over 45 minutes. Made it kind of awkward and gives a bad image to the sandwich shop.   Oh well. At least I can say I ate here : /",

Potbelly s was my favorite before this place, but when I tried it it moved into first place. I had the All American on wheat. It had cranberry sauce and ranch dressing. At first I thought it was weird to have ranch dressing and cranberry sauce , but it worked out perfect and was really good. My husband had the Chipotle Chicken Avocado without the Avocado. He said it was really good. We truly enjoyed this little sandwich place.  I would definitely get another sandwich from here when I come back to Vegas !",

Both are very tasty and yummy but I would go for the Italian more. The prices are as good as their sandwiches. I highly recommend this place to those who love warm sandwiches. If you go to Vegas, give this place a try you won't regret.  Customer service was good. Thank you!",

It's towards the back of the casino floor and kind of a snake to get to.  Arrived and thankfully no line, I asked the dude taking orders to give me what he recommended, something mind blowing for yelp purposes and he said cannonball without hesitation.  The line to pay is separate, short stocky dude charging, drunk talking got me calling him the real earl, he seemed pissed about it, c'mon dude be a good sport.  They give you the vibrating pager and when it rings you go get it at the counter, the usual.  The cannonball was average, there's not much to describe because it's bread and meatballs, they weren't that great and considering everything I eat is better when I'm drunk that's kind of saying a lot. The bread hits the stomach well though.   Eh, 24/7 helps the hype of this place but there are a few others spots with the same hours that are bit more noteworthy..so many reviews and such a high rating that I would say come here just to say you tried it, who knows maybe earl will treat you right.",

I went for the Chipotle Chicken Avocado sandwich ($6.49) and regular Tomato Soup ($3.99). The line moves fairly quickly here as you say your order at the first register. Then they give you a buzzer and total as you walk down to the second register where you pay. I enjoy the quick and easy process of this place.  I thought the bread was a bit dry for my sandwich and it could've used more chipotle sauce. My soup is always my favorite, which I also dip my sandwich in. The tomato soup has a good consistency and also comes topped with a couple croutons that's already soaked in the soup. I've also tried the other soups and they're all great and flavorful. Everything here is exactly what it sounds like on the menu, so you can't go wrong.",

If you stay at Planet Hollywood or close to it, this is a great place to go! Ate here at least once a day after I found it.  If you read the menu and the sandwich sounds good, get it! I promise you that you won't be disappointed. Their hot sandwiches are perfect anytime of the day. Just to list off some sandwiches that I've had, The Earl's Club, The Original 1762, Chipotle Chicken Avocado, The Full Montagu, Caprese, Holiday Turkey, Italian, Ham 'N' Swiss, and All American. I can guarantee you that there definitely are something I typically dislike and this place just dominated in making it delicious. I absolutely despise horseradish, but it wasn't overwhelming in my sandwich. The mac and cheese is also good.  Heart broken that they no longer have ice cream sandwiches and the other sweets that they use to have. Wish I can give this place more stars.",

I was warned by my friend about crazy lineups so i opted for Monday afternoon around 2:30pm and there were no lineups!   I actually visited two locations for Earls. The location inside Planet Hollywood as well as the one inside Caesars Palace - will review both.   For this location here, I ordered the Full Montague while my boyfriend had the Earls club. Both tasted pretty similar to me and for the price I thought it was pretty good for the value.   For my second visit, I ordered the veggie sandwich and it was delicious! I liked this one alot more. It had lettuce, avocado and bunch of other veggies smothered in I believe a pesto sauce - super filling and satisfied. Would definitely go back!",

While the sandwiches aren't HUGE like a Jersey's Mikes sub shop, but hey, it's a SANDWICH, not some 24\" long mayo-and-bacon loaded heart attack on white.  I would definitely hit this place up if I'm walking along Planet Hollywood casinos or Bally's.   The only thing that would prevent me of giving me the fifth star is the limited amount of locations, especially if it's supposed to be a chain or franchised place.. who ISN'T building one of these near by on the east coast?",

Earl of Sandwich is located inside Planet Hollywood and is a fast food-type joint. But better. From my memory, they have about 10-12 different sandwiches and more salads and wraps. But please, try a sandwich. I ordered the Full Montagu, which has roast beef and turkey in it. I waited less than 10 minutes for my sandwich and sat in the restaurant to eat. The sandwich was quite a delight. After eating at buffets the day before, it was nice to bite into something fresh and more light. All the ingredients were fresh. I especially like tomatoes and bread. Oh the bread!! The start of a good sandwich is the bread and this place got it right. The bread was unlike other sandwich breads I've had before and it was just plain delicious. The whole sandwich left me super full and excited to come back here the next time I go to Vegas. I'm just amazed at how cheap the sandwich is. Sandwich lovers and Vegas goers, check this place out!",

    "text": "Ah, the plight of the pescatarian......particularly at a sandwich shop. I scanned the menu at Earl looking for options and found 2 -- the caprese and tuna. There were 3 of us eating so I ordered one of each.   TUNA -   Tuna to mayo ratio - perfect. Not so much mayo to drown out the taste of the tuna but not so little that the flavor of mayo was missing.   Sandwich bread -- also perfect. It had just the right amount of butter - not so much that your hands become a grease factory after each bite... but not so little that you can't taste that little extra bit of tasty goodness. Also, it was piping hot and perfectly toasted... yummmmm.....   Nummy in my tummy factor -- solid 10. This tuna sandwich may have been one of the best tuna sandwiches I've ever had!   So why the 4 stars, you ask? The caprese was MEH. The mozzarella was sadly perched on sorry- looking tomatoes... and I could barely taste the basil.  What (somewhat) saved this 'wich was the delish bread.  For under $15 (including a bag of baked chips) for all the food ordered, you really can't go wrong with Earl.... especially since it's open 24 hours. Now what we need is for this place to open an off-the-strip outfit so that us locals don't have to brave the Strip if we have a late-night sandwich craving.",

I recently stayed at the Planet Hollywood Towers, giving me every more reason to come here at least once a day to satisfy my cravings, whether it be for a regular lunch, or for post-drinking munchies.  Though I'm not a huge fan of turkey, and despite its pretty bland looking description, the Earl's Club is super tasty, even without the A1-tasting sauce that you can add when you sit down.   The ciabatta bread is toasty good and as all great sandwiches go, there's an awesome balance of lettuce, tomatoes, and meat.  I also get the Caribbean Jerk sandwich too, which has the same great qualities, except with a tangier taste and red and banana peppers that give it a sour kick.  I've also heard that the Full Montagu is amazing as well, and I plan on trying it next time!",

You can pick your sandwich and add chips and drink to your order. They give you the buzzer and you wait for your sandwich to get done.  I ordered the All American sandwich, which had roasted turkey and cranbarry sauce in it. It was very tasty and everybody else liked their sandwiches too. It tasted very fresh and the bread was soft in the inside and crunchy on the outsite. Prices are reasonable and staff is friendly and helpfull. Would definitely go back there.",

I ordered their Original, which is roast beef with cheese and horseradish sauce. Pretty good but not the best I've had. I also tried their Montagu, which had turkey, roast beef, cheese, lettuce, tomato and honey mustard. Yum. Definitely a goodie! The most popular one was the Club, which is exactly what it is.  There are also wraps and salads too! Tried their frozen lemonade and it was very refreshing!   And...we can't forget....dessert! They had fresh baked cookies, sundaes, and what I will definitely try next time..,, the Ghirardelli ice cream sandwich: vanilla ice cream in between two Ghirardelli chocolate (Ya, SF!) cookies! ;9  Definitely a place to go to if u want a change from the fine dining and buffets!",

Well besides not wanting to be a conformist and give this place 5 stars like you other thousand + yelpers I was let down big time..It was really disappointing to find out how restrictive Earl of Sandwich is with their franchising. The only reason I bring this issue up is because of a huge sign they have in their dining area talking about how great their franchising opportunities are. Upon investigation they have less than 20 locations worldwide and that's including the 3 that are \"coming soon\". I figured these low numbers were due to this being a new franchise. NOPE. From reading their franchise application I was left with the feeling that I would have better luck applying for a senior executive position at Google. Also I live in California which seems to be on their black list of states they will not enter into. Its a shame because there are some Cali hot spots Earl of Sandwich would thrive in, no question.

My broccoli cheddar soup was greasy and runny, absolute no chunks of broccoli. Seriously I got the 'bottom of the barrel' batch of soup, so much for waiting the long line that's always there! Every time I visit, there's a line, long or small. Maybe I was sobering up the time before my last visit here because my sandwich tasted that good. Sadly this visit was nothing near that.

I always go for the Caprese sandwich there (I'm a veggie gal) and ahhh so so yummy! The bread is perfectly toasted and yet soft at the same time, and as all caprese creations taste well together, Earl's somehow just does it better! And the portion size is just right for me. Keeps me full and satisfied!  Good for your wallet and tummy.",

The bread and everything put together was excellent.    The cashier was very friendly as well as she entertained some of us drunkies while waiting for our sandwiches! :)",

The employees are really funny even though it was 3 in the morning and they were super friendly!    I planned to eat half of the sandwich and save the other half for breakfast/lunch, but it was so delicious that I ate the whole thing before I knew it!

    "text": "Considering Earl of Sandwich is 24 hours, this is a pretty legit sandwich place. Not the best I've ever had, but good enough to satisfy your sandwich craving drunk or sober. Plus the sandwiches are decently priced and even though it always appears to be packed, the lines move fairly quickly!   This sandwich place is mainly known for its \"hot\" sandwiches. I shared the Earl's Club with my gf and the sandwich consisted of turkey, bacon, swiss cheese, lettuce, tomatoes and the Earl special sauce. The sandwich was just OKAY. I think the bread was much tastier than the ingredients in the sandwich itself. The meats were nothing special. It sort of tasted like ordinary deli meat. I am quite particular with my sandwiches....If it uses turkey for instance, I actually expect soft tender chunks of turkey not really deli style.   I also tried the Caprese sandwich and I think that one is my fave. Just because the ciabatta bread was so lusciously soft, it sits perfectly when mozzarella, tomato, basil, and balsamic vinaigrette are laid out in between.   There is an array of baked goodies as you are getting closer to pay for your meal. It is pretty tempting, to buy, but I passed on those goodies.",

As soon as we got there we knew it must be good cause there was a loooong line!! About 30min later we ordered what we wanted. I ordered the Tuna Melt and the Caribbean Jerk Chicken. My friend got the Meatball one and the Tuna Melt. After waiting anxiously for our sandwiches, our order was finally ready. I took my first bite into the Tuna Melt and it was so freaking good I almost cried. Crunchy warm toasted bread, soft flaky tuna with perfectly gooey melted cheese. Best Tuna Melt ever!!!!! The Caribbean Jerk Chicken was pretty good too but nothing compared to that perfect Tuna Melt. Earl of Sandwich..... I will never have a sandwich elsewhere. Definitely coming back whenever I'm in Vegas!! Hopefully this time I won't lose money on my way in...",

My favorites are the Jamaican Jerk chicken, and the Original (roast beef, cheddar, and horseradish).  Unfortunately, the portions are kind of small and I think the prices are a little expensive for what you get.  That being said, the flavors are definitely there for a quick fast-food sandwich.",

How could anyone resist a savory $6 lunch on the strip?!   I tried The Full Montagu Sandwich, which seemed to be one of the more popular sandwiches on the menu. It consists of Roast Beef, Turkey, Aged Swiss and Sharp Cheddar, Lettuce, Roma Tomatoes and Earl's Special Mustard Sauce. Damn this sandwich was good! Bread - perfect, combination of meats - perfect, toppings and sauce - PERFECT.   There isn't much for me to say about the service or the ambiance, just because its at such a busy corner in Planet Hollywood, but the food can speak for itself. I think it's also important to note that the line is intimidatingly long, but never fear, it moves fairly quickly. I think it's safe to say that I'll be stopping by Earl's whenever I'm in Vegas. Although... it will be much easier getting my fix once the Anaheim location opens!! Until then... Vegas Earl of Sandwich it is!",

The Full Montagu <a href=\"http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/DkYS3arLOhA8si5uUEmHOw?select=0hAaWj1C6H_DdxKTKrNxvA\">yelp.com/biz_photos/DkYS...</a>      As you can see, The Full Montagu is not an adult themed show featuring scantly clad sexy boys shaking their junk for the masses. This Full Montagu is a big, warm, mouthwatering sandwich packed with freshly roasted beef, turkey, aged Swiss, sharp cheddar, lettuce, Roma tomatoes and Earl's Mustard Sauce (I also add banana peppers). This sandwich is perfect. It's salty. It's sweet and because I added peppers, it's also slightly spicy. And the bread it's served on, oh that bread is great too. Lightly toasted on the outside and soft and fluffy on the inside.   Besides the FM, Earl also has a good amount of other amazing tasting sandwiches, both hot and cold, like their Caribbean Jerk Chicken and the Cannonballs, both of which I sampled before (at the location in FL).  They also have salads, wraps, chips, tasty desserts and even breakfast Sammie's <a href=\"http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/DkYS3arLOhA8si5uUEmHOw?select=bcK75Axd_C6o9qCvSOe-pw\">yelp.com/biz_photos/DkYS...</a>  The Vegas location of Earl is conveniently located inside the Planet Hollywood Resort and Casino and is open 24 hours a day, 7 days a week. Freaking sweet.   And last but not least, the prices here are super cheap, which is also a major plus in case you pulled a Clark Griswold and lost your life savings at the blackjack tables and only have a few bucks left to your name. I love Vegas Vacation. It's hilarious.   Anyways, to sum it all up ya gotta check out Earl of Sandwich while you're in LV.  It rocks! Oh, and Eugine, baby, I thought of your handsome mug every time I walked by Earl.",

I could make it myself at home, for the low low price of free ninety nine. With the exception of a handful of places, for the most part, I avoid ordering sandwiches when dining out.   Earl of Sandwich, is one of these exceptions. After eating nothing but buffets for the weekend, I desperately needed a change in the food scenery. Although I'm not super fond of sandwiches, the boyfriend and the bestie are so we stopped here for lunch on our last day in Vegas.   Talk about a sensory overload. There are so many options to choose from--sandwiches, soups, and salads. But heellloooo, I'm here for the sandwiches! Okay, I lied, I also got a salad too--but more on that later. Although I wanted everything, because they ALL sounded that good, I ended up getting the Full Montagu because it has a little bit of everything, turkey, roast beef, swiss and cheddar? Yes, yes, yes and yes! The bread is perfectly toasted, and the meat is thinly sliced and amazingly tender. The melted cheeses not only added flavor but helped to keep the sandwich moist. Plus, I love mustard on anything, so yes again! At first glance, I found the sandwiches to be on the small side, but in hindsight, it was perfect!   So in addition to the sandwich, I also ended up getting the Baja Chicken salad. Loved the packaging and the avocado, but this was just okaaaayyy, there was nothing special about it, and I probably wouldn't order it again. If you're thinking of add-on's for the meal though, I'd definitely do the brownie sandwich if you have a bit of a sweet tooth!   If you're on the strip, Earl of Sandwich is definitely a must do! It's a great change of pace if you're sick of overeating at the buffets. Portions are reasonably sized, and prices aren't bad either. Your waistline will breathe a sigh of relief, and your wallet will thank you also!  Lesson learned though, don't order the salad at a sandwich joint. Always, always, go for the sandwich!",

All of them are good but I go simple usually with the original and beef and blue (now not on the menu- it was roast beef and blue cheese!) . These are hefty sandwiches so I'm very full.   Their brownie was pretty good too and their soups are usually not bad.   And they didn't hike up their prices just because they're in a casino!",

It was warm, gooey from the melted cheese and just really flavorful.  Put a little dijon mustard on there and you have a piece of sandwich heaven in your hands.  My fiancee had the tuna melt and from the bite that I had... or rather, the only bite she allowed me... it was very good as well.    Prices aren't all that bad for a damn good sandwich.  Will I return?  Probably.  It's a nice alternative to countless buffets and foo-fooey restaurants in Sin City.",

    "text": "After a long night of good times, you just have that craving for some late night or should I say early morning snacking/food. Where to go thats open 24 hours????  Earl of Sandwich!!!!!  This place definitely did not disappoint at all for me. Price was reasonably around $6 mark. The deliciousness of The Full Montagu (consisting of  Roasted Beef, Turkey, Swiss & Cheddar Cheese, Lettuce, Roma Tomato & Earl's Mustard) = Simply comfort food and pleasing warmness to the stomach that will definitely make you feel a bit fuzzy inside with how the sandwich is built.   The Caribbean Jerk Chicken which is grilled Chicken, roasted red & banana Peppers & spicy jerk sauce, definitely is not something you'd want to miss out as well.....  Casual industrial/city scape type decor and quick on the service at 2am. They were on the ball especially when it appears the crowd doesn't seem to die down much at this place.   Definitely a must return when in Vegas. Wish they'd open more outside of Vegas!!!",

I think my favorite is the tuna sandwich because I love the creamy texture and taste of it. Least favorite is the philly cheese sandwich because I've tried better ones from Subway and other sandwich shops. The cheese was not melted and I like my cheese to be melted. The bread was toasted just the way I like it and it had just the right amount of crunchiness to it. I am in love with the bread.",

I was starved craving for the infamous Earl of Sandwich that I had heard so much about. Unfortunately the sandwich left me unsatisfied.  What made me sad was Earl had an advantage in me being vulnerable to hunger and dehydration.  Maybe I expected much more from this famous spot but I honestly would have rather eaten a foot long meatball subway sandwich.   I had the chipotle chicken burger with bacon. The bread was really good soft and a toasty exterior. Sauce was good. Though there was never a  time where I was like \"damn this is good!\" I ate the whole sandwich with discontent. I pretended like my sandwich was bomb just to not be a buzz kill that night.  I love the gold wrapping though!",

    "text": "Okay. So here's the deal.  You go to a few different sandwich shops on different days to pick up some goods to indulge your nom nom feeling. Say you like the BLT or the Club and that's what you get every time, regardless.  You choose these because you focus on the what's being sandwiched between the two pieces of bread.  The bread is seriously just some edible cushion to keep your hands from getting messy from eating the goodness of what's inside the sandwich.  It's the law of sandwich bread.  You come in Earl of Sandwich and that law is completely broken. You can get ANY sandwich, and despite which one you get, it WILL be a winner.  The highlight of each sandwich IS the bread. It's perfectly toasted on the outside and warm and fluffy in the inside. It truly disgusts me to even think about how beautiful sandwich bread could be. A dinky picture and even this review can barely describe the wonders of their bread. You're probably thinking, \"Damn, this girl is seriously trippin' about the bread\", and you know what? Yeah, I am. It's seriously that good. Okay, thats enough on bread.  The Full Montagu is very delicious and the roast beef was tender.  The Club tasted so fresh and the bacon gave it a nice crunch.  The Carribean Jerk is a must have if you want loads of flavor in your sandwich.  I've also tried some of their wonderfully made soups:  Tomato Soup- was thick, creamy, and had croutons in it. My boyfriend ordered the food while I was away in one of the stores, and the soup was sitting for awhile. I came back, all sad faced, because the croutons were going to be soggy.... or atleast that's what I thought. It was 100% crunchy and the soup was at a perfect hot temperature. If you like tomato soup, it's a MUST have.  Broccoli Cheese Soup- was also very creamy and flavorful. It was thick and chunky, but not too thick where it had the consistency of porridge ( a red flag for me to send it away ).   Expect to stand in a line during hungry hours; You get a pager when your food is ready. Trust me, its worth the wait! The sandwiches are your ordinary sandwich prices and soups are also well priced. I honestly believe it tastes like a million bucks though.... nothing compares to these sandwiches.  One of the best parts is, is that my hotel was a 3 minute walking distance from Planet Hollywood ( @ the Marriot ) and I literally could walk here ANY part of the day/night ( 24-hour service!!!! ) to grab a nomster sandwich.  I'm seriously coming here EVERY time I visit Vegas!  PS-- Beware of staring at random people in that area, you may get punched to the face and knocked down to the ground. My friend did, atleast. HAHAHAHAHHA. Sucks.",

Why do I feel like those are the only two types of restaurants on the strip? Besides Earl of Sandwich that is.  Love their sandwiches here; they're hot, flavorful, and satisfying, whether it be lunch time or fourth meal. Caribbean jerk chicken sandwich is where it's at, but every other sandwich I've sampled (yes, I take bites of my friends' food, who doesn't?) was delish. Went a taxi ride out of my way to eat here and it was worth it...maybe because I didn't pay for the taxi :)",

    "text": "Earl of Sandwich is definitely one of my favorite places to grab a nice hot sandwich. It's too bad that it's located within the strip. Sure, it can be a great spot for tourists, but a terrible place for a local to hit up. The strip is never a fun place to travel to, especially during the peak dining hours. Despite that, I guess I shouldn't complain though. The next closest location is over 1,000 miles away.  I've been here a few times. Never been disappointed once. Here's a brief rundown on two things I tried:  \"The Full Motagu - Roasted Beef, Turkey, Swiss & Cheddar Cheese, Lettuce, Roma Tomato & Earl's Mustard.\" It's a more traditional tasting sandwich, but really hits the sweet spot if this is what you're in the mood for.  \"All American - Roasted Turkey, Buttermilk Ranch, Cranberries, Sharp Cheddar Cheese, Lettuce & Tomato.\" This was one of my favorites. The addition of cranberries added a nice twist to the sandwich. It's somewhat comparable to the Bobbie at Capriotti's, except you don't feel like you went through a Thanksgiving feast after eating it.  Prices are definitely very reasonable for a strip location. I'd think that these prices were for an off-strip location. A hot sandwich will run you about $6-8. Add a cup of tomato soup with your sandwich and you're golden. This isn't a place I'd go out of my way for, but a sure stop every time I'm in the area.",

We walked half of the Vegas strip to get to this infamous sandwich spot... of course took a few detours on the way but we did take this journey on foot from Venetian.  I stop here almost every visit to Vegas because for $5.99 a sandwich, it's the biggest bang for your buck.    I would recommend splitting sandwiches with a friend so you can get to try different flavors... but also some of the sandwiches just gets a little repetitive after about half.  The line here is fairly long but consistently moves so it doesn't feel too bad.  It's totally worth the wait if you're thinking about leaving and going somewhere else.  I need to franchise one in Orange County so i can serve my own little sandwich wrapped in gold!",

I'm a native of upstate NY so I opted to try their buffalo chicken. It had me sweating just the right amount by the end of the sandwich, which is PERFECT. My friend had a sandwich that sounded like thanksgiving dinner on bread. He was also quite satisfied, and said the turkey was incredible. Can't beat the value for the money. Strongly recommended.",

I've never been to Earl of Sandwhich but B and his friends always make a point to stop by on a Vegas trip, so it must be pretty good. +1 already when i saw their list of hot sandwiches - i love hot sammiches.   Earl of Sandwhich is just a short hop and a skip away from the casino, and the line was pretttty long. But the sandwiches were good enough and/or we were lazy enough that we ended up getting in line anyway.   Ravenous B (as usual) ordered the Cannonball! and the Earl's Club. Cannonball! was only okay, nothing notable, but The Earl's Club was a very classic sandwich - can't go wrong there. I got the Italian, which was BOMB. Even though the sandwiches are on the small side, I didn't end up eating all of it since we also got the Chicken Tortilla Soup, which was delicious and scaldingly hot (\"And Andrea, I mean SCALDING hot.\") Another +1 since we both hate lukewarm soup. Saved the last half of my sandwich to eat later that night, and it was STILL delicious.  at ~$6 per sandwich, it's a little expensive for the size. But considering I paid that much for a glass of grapefruit juice later that day, this is probably the best deal you're going to get. Aside from Steak-and-Eggs.",

I am excited for their Downtown Disney Anaheim, CA location opening soon.",

    "text": "After partying all night Friday / Saturday, I woke up Sunday afternoon craving a sandwich. I've heard great things about Earl's so I decided to trek over to Planet Hollywood and check it out. When I arrived around 12pm the line had no less than 20 people AND every table was taken. The line actually moves really fast, so don't let this deter you. I was at the counter placing my order within 12 minutes flat. I literally spent my time in line scanning the menu and trying to make a decision...everything looks so freakin good!    Sandwich: I had the Original Earl's Club - Turkey, bacon, Swiss, sandwich sauce, lettuce & tomato. Bread is soft and crunchy and the ingredients are fresh. Most definitely better than any other chain sandwich joint.   Soup: If you even remotely like tomato soup you MUST try Earl's! The consistency is more like a bisque and it has massive homemade croutons mixed in. Perfect cure for any hangover!   Prices are super reasonable - my order came up to about $10...not bad for a good hearty lunch in Vegas.",

The line may seem a little intimidating because it can get long, but it's systemized well so that even though the line can get long, it moves -- which is a good thing.   There are plenty of selections to choose from but when in doubt, go with The Original. It's your basic roast beef sandwich with a hint of horseradish, toasted in the oven. It comes out perfect and if you're feeling daring, order up a side of the broccoli and cheese soup and DIP the sandwich in it. Trust me, you'll be glad you did.   As an added bonus, if you've been out partying until 5:00am, a sandwich from Earl's is the perfect thing to eat to sober your drunk ass up.",

My friend and I went to Sgt Pepper Live last night, so I suggested we give the Earl a try. Whenever I saw it on the home page, it always seemed to be getting five stars with the occasional four. I'm going to have to go with three.  Not that there's anything wrong with three stars. For sure, the sandwich I had was good. At $5.99 a pop, they are well-priced for a premium LV Blvd location. It just didn't wow me enough to elicit fandom.  If you're hungry and in the area in front of Planet Hollywood, you should definitely give Earl of Sandwich a try. It's just off the Strip inside the Miracle Mile Shops near the South entrance. They are now open 24 hours, so that's definitely a plus.",

I like the \"crunch\" factor of the bread and the saucy mayo, hot chicken, and nice schmear of avocado BUT they are kind of on the smaller size of sandwiches for $6-$7. Now this place is a huge upgrade from the ordinary Subway sandwiches, its a uniquely crafted panini and is open 24 hours.   I would eat here again, but it would not be one of my \"go-to\" places.",

    "text": "The history of the sandwich goes way back, and while the fourth Earl of Sandwich did not actually invent the sandwich, he is credited with coining the term.  People supposedly used to ask for \"the same as Sandwich,\" and over time, the phrase was inevitably shortened to sandwich (and sammie).   My friend in LA told me about Earl of Sandwich in PH the day before I left for Vegas, saying she had wanted to check it out but didn't have the time to do so.  When we arrived late in the evening, I was pleased to see that the joint was under half a mile from our hotel (the Flamingo).    Despite the late hour, there were still a fair number of people waiting around for sammies.  I was so happy to see that the shop stays open till 3 AM; it was a monday, too!  Everything sounded great, but I ended up with the Hawaiian BBQ sandwich: <a href=\"/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2Fi92.photobucket.com%2Falbums%2Fl18%2FAyJee%2FIMG_6945.jpg&s=561577d229d448304f93d1d433c444ba41b41ff5a96e685db9493d2f92f1df60\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">i92.photobucket.com/albu...</a>  And a bowl of WIsconsin Cheddar soup :)   My sandwich had chicken, sweet BBQ sauce, and pineapple inside. Derricious. Nice, chewy bread... warm chicken, sweet pineapple... It's nothing fancy, and definitely nowhere near as big as a Subway footlong, but my expectations were met, and I left satisfied. :) Not bad for a relatively inexpensive meal in Vegas.   Also, the soup was a bit too salty, but I'm sure most people would like it.",

Second; Thank you Earl of Sandwich, you made a Mayo believer.  The sandwich; it was like biting into heaven and just looking for trouble....but you cant because everything is soo good. I was trying to analyze every aspect of the sandwich....it was great! The soft panini style bread was toasted to perfection and layered with some delicious swiss cheese and then they carefully place your albacore tuna mix in and bam...deliciousness.

There is a long line in the afternoon, but it moves quickly.  They also sell chips, etc.  But there is an ABC store right behind Earl's and it's a great place (and cheaper) to get chips & soda/beer with your sandwich.

With that being said, Earl of Sandwich was such a pleasant surprise. The only type of sandwiches I like are tortas and even then they can only be from Cook's.  The process is simple really. You go up and order your sandwiches and they give you a buzzer. Then you get in line to get your sandwiches. While you're in line, you pick up beer, chips and desserts if you choose. Once you're at the end, you pay for everything. By the time you pay, your buzzer gives you the signal and your sandwiches are ready!  The Caribbean Jerk Chicken had some pretty tender, juicy pieces of chicken inside stuffed with red and banana peppers inside. There's a spicy jerk spread they put in there which gave it a very subtle kick. My advice would be to eat your sandwich right away. I waited maybe longer than I should and it just didn't look oven fresh like my friend's. Regardless, Earl knows his sandwiches and I cannot wait to stop by again in a few weeks!",

My family and I went after we drove in so it was a bit late, but it's Vegas there is no such thing as late. We got there and ordered a few sandwiches (that we washed down with drinky poos from Fat Tuesdays around the corner). I can only speak to the Chipotle chicken avocado (~$7). SO.. gewd. Well done Earl.   The bread was toasted and crispy on the outside, the chipotle sauce offered a creamy spicy kick to the sandwich. The avocado was rich and creamy but didn't ruin the texture the sandwich like it sometimes does. Cheese yum. Chicken yum. We'll be stopping by again.   If my relatively conservative/frugal parents thought that the sandwich was a good deal...that's saying something. They also enjoyed people watching the drunk party goers and assorted people walking by.",

I wish there was a sandwich joint like this in the Bay Area. I love the Full Montagu and the classic Earl. The BLT is a classic that can't go wrong. For a good $10 with chips and a soda, you can definitely share if you aren't too hungry. I come here at least 3-4 times during my stay in Vegas. I can't wait to go back.",

That should be the \"MOTTO\" for E.O.S. cuz those sandwich buns were definitely properly toasted (my bad, I'm still on my Drake hype after recently leaving Vegas sounding like a broken record). I regret that my 1st meal when I arrived at pH Towers (@Westgate) was Panda Express for the sake of convenience and to absorb the alcohol I had inflight; not to mention the AMF I had on the way to my room. Day 2, I still didn't feel like a sandwich was much of a meal (coming from someone who just ate at Pan-X right!?) Haha! Shenna G. offered a bite of her Holiday HOT sammie but I declined cuz I didn't want to kill my buzz...  Finally, on the 3rd and final day when everyone was leaving and I'm now on the verge of sobriety; Rhia A. mentioned that she ate at Earl's pretty much throughout the entire weekend so at this point I wanted to try it for myself. Ordered the Earl's Club and... D'ZYAMNNN! As simple as it was, it was probably one of the best franchise sandwich shop sandwiches I've ever had (times 2). Perfect portions of Turkey, Bacon & Cheese. Makes me wonder why CA doesn't have a joint like this. The 2nd best franchised sandwich joint I fell in lust with was Potbelly Sandwich Shop @Midway Airport.  Overall, if you're staying at pH or in the mood for an inexpensive meal after you've depleted your funds from either the tables, strippers or bottle service. Earl's got your back! You won't need to go for broke at their prices...",

There is only 1 veggie option - bread with all the veggies they have, you are better with a slice of veggie pizza at the secret pizza place at Cosmo, right accross the street  People who rate this 4-5don't know better.",

With that keep this in mind and fit it into your  food plan appropriately.  I had the Reuben and my wife had the BLT.   We were both pleased.  It was fast, the place probably isn't the cleanest in the eating area but that's more probably due to demand and turnover than anything.  Like I said understand where this fits into you plan and you won't be disappointed.",

My two girlfriends did not want to go (they are way more posh then me) so I went by myself. Sadly the line was about 50+ in front of me. Could you believe I still waited? First let me say, this is one of the cheapest places on The Strip. Their sandwiches are still priced at $6.50 a pop. I always order the Holiday Turkey which comes with cranberry sauce. OMG. My mouth is watering right now as I write this... oh I also had the oatmeal raisin cookie to top it off (only $2) and that was phenomenal as well. If you have never experienced Earl's, it is a must when you attend Vegas. If you are reading this and debating it, just get off your phone and head over right now ;)",

I got the Holiday Turkey which is filled with turkey, cornbread stuffing, turkey, gravy, and cranberry sauce. The bread is perfectly toasted with a bit of a slight crunch. Absolutely perfect combination with the delicious fillings of the sandwich. I also got to try some of The Original 1762.. which is definitely something that you can't go wrong with (as long as you love horseradish like I do!)

Arrived at around 11am on a Saturday morning. Way too many people here. My sandwich was amazing though so worth the wait. Also got this chipotle chicken sandwich that was great too.   Also make sure you order the tomato soup because it totally makes a big difference.   The full montagu had roast beef in it. Tomatoes too. Made it nice and juicy. Man my mouth is watering as I'm typing this.   Price for all 3 items came to around $19 dollars.",

    "text": "Just adding to this heap of glowing reviews to say...  TL;DR: One of the BEST hot sandwiches I've ever tasted. My recommendations for hot sandwiches are the Hawaiian BBQ, Montagu, and the Caprese (not in any particular order). And do yourself a favor and go the extra mile with their tomato soup.   Park in the Planet Hollywood/Miracle Mile Shops parking. It might be a bit confusing to navigate to this restaurant (but then again, when is it easy in Vegas?)  It is very simple; it's more of a deli counter than a restaurant. Order food, pay, and wait. You look for your own seating, and clean up after yourself.   As for your order, you can't go wrong with any of the hot sandwiches. The bread is hits the perfect ratios of crispy on the outside and chewy on the inside!!! The bread seriously makes all of these sandwiches. For specific orders, I've had the Chicken Chipotle Avocado (which was a LITTLE lacking in flavor) and the Caprese, which I highly recommend. My friends and family have recommended the Montagu and the Hawaiian BBQ.   I also 90% recommend the tomato soup. So flavorful and perfectly complements the sandwiches. However, I docked off 10% because it gives me and my friends indigestion.... Maybe it's just us? This has happened on more than one separate occasion... Just a warning. I still order it anyways! :P  Not much to say about service other than it is quick even with a packed line and restaurant. Very efficient.",

Comparable to a subway, you'll get in the que hoping you had your sandwich ready in minutes. Instead you'll get a number that's called shortly after your order is placed.   I ordered the original sandwich, which is basically a suped-up roast beef sandwich comparable to Arby's. The bread was fine, but the quality of meat disappointed me quite a bit. While thick slices covered hastily in horseradish, the tendons absolutely ruined the sandwich. I couldn't chew through my sandwich and found myself spitting it out. The bites I could chew required mustard to make it through.  It may be a result of a very busy establishment and a lack of quality control, but I don't think my experience in Vegas was highlighted by the original sandwich. I won't be coming back here again, and I hope there will be more taste in the roast beef for those who have it in the future.",

There is always a line, but it goes by relatively quick. The dining area is somewhat small with limited tables and most of the time they are usually full. But luckily they package the sandwiches \"to go ready\" so you are able to eat them anywhere.   The first time I think I tried some of the ham and Swiss sandwich and another one I could not remember. They were both good, but nothing out of the ordinary for the sandwich.  The second time I tried it I tried the chipotle chicken avocado which was amazing! I am one to not tolerate spiciness, but the chipotle sauce added just a kick of spiciness that was not too much. The bacon added some extra flavor to the sandwich. The sandwiches always come out hot and toasted on delicious bread.",

    "text": "Probably one of the best cheaper eats in Vegas. I would compare it to Panera Bread (similar types of foods), but that would be a disservice to Earl of Sandwich.  I ordered the chipotle chicken avocado sandwich and the thai salad to share with my mom. The sandwich was perfect! A perfect blend of flavors, and their bread really made the difference. Honestly, I could just eat the bread all day. The salad was also pretty good, but if I had to do it again, I'd just order another sandwich. The only complaint is that the sandwiches are on the smaller side. They are filling enough to leave me content, but I could probably eat two and feel on the lower side of full.  This location is inside Planet Hollywood, near the row of shops. There was a long line during peak lunch hours, but it moved along fairly quickly, and the food came out fast enough.  I would definitely recommend stopping by for a cheap, quick meal while you're wandering around the Strip.",

When we arrived the line was wrapped around along the restaurant but seemed to go by fast since I was pretty intoxicated.  These sandwiches are pretty darn cheap and REALLY good! It took awhile for the food to be done but it was well worth the wait. The sandwich was warm enough for the cheese to be ooey gooey and the bread was perfectly toasted that added that extra texture of crunch!  For the price, you would think they would use cheap ingredients that you would find at fast food chains, but they didnt! The bacon was thick, they gave plenty of meat, the cheese was not your average american and the bread just held it all together.  As for the mac n cheese...I know I shouldn't have expected much since they are a sandwich place, but I take mac n cheese VERY serious, and theirs was just alright. I would pass on it next time I go there.  There was plenty of seating available, which was especially perfect since it seemed like everyone and their mother was waiting in line for their delicious sandwiches!  This is a must try if you're in Vegas!",

Maybe that's because you make it yourself so the ratio of lemonade to ice tea is in your control at the self serve drink station.  SMH I thought it was a premade drink.    The brownies are also very good and a good take home snack.  If we were at the hotel again or in the mall we'd visit again but I'm not sure I'd come just for the sandwich.",

It's open 24 hours so whether you're coming back from a late night at the strip or just waking up with a hangover Earls is there cranking out delicious little pockets of heaven.   They have a variety of sandwiches which all come come toasted and items such as coleslaw , potato salad or earls brand kettle potato chips to add to them. Or soup for dipping those yummy sandwiches into. They also have bakery items including cookies , muffins and brownies to satisfy your sweettooth.   I'm a creature if habit so when I find something I like. I like to stick with it because I know it won't disappoint me. So I usually go for the Caprese or the Holiday turkey.   Caprese - Thick slices of Mozzerella cheese toasted on artisan bread topped with tomato , balsamic glaze and basil. So yummy and perfect with tomato soup. So comforting & always hits the spot.   Holiday Turkey - I love thanksgiving sandwiched between some bread. Capriottis had the Bobbie and Earls they make a slightly different version of that tastier IMO too. Turkey breast on artisan bread with gravy , stuffing , and cranberry sauce. So yummy !   Hawaiian BBQ - my boyfriends fav. Chicken , BBQ sauce , ham , swiss and pineapple.  Maybe it was sauced to heavily for my taste and the pineapple was canned. Menu says fresh. Clearly not. Or maybe it was the fact that the chicken and everything was sliding around and I hate that. Personally not my fav.   The portion size is great too. Not too big or too small. I loved the way it's packaged too. Gold wrapping with little emblems like little gifts.   Earls you always leave my happy and not too stuffed. Change the name to Earl of Greatness because well it's sounds awesome and it's True. I will be back Earls. Maybe I'll try something else. Haha probably not !",

The cranberry sauce added so much flavor to it all.  It can come off as a little sweet to some people, but I really enjoyed it.  I thought it was weird at first because I've never had cranberry sauce in a sandwich but it turned out to be amazing, especially with the dijon mustard they have, too.  Earl of Sandwich is a MUST when you're in vegas!!!! Definitely recommend it to all",

Since I stay away from that area at all costs, I can't really comment on too much that goes on since I prefer to not get rooked and eat in the burbs instead, The place was 'ok' and I'm glad that I gave it a shot.  I had the Cannonballs and it was nothing to write home about.  Service was fast, but it seemed rather small.",

It doesn't taste like heaven, but none the less still good. I love how they are open 24 hours a day. So late night hunger answered if you are staying near by. IF you are willing to go to subway for a 5 dollar sandwich a dollar more will get you something that taste a million times better. I had the all-american. yummy. My boyfriend had the ham and swiss which was also pretty good. Must try at least once while you're here.",

The ice tea sucks, strong tea bag flavor with no sweeteners. The cream filled brownie sandwich is HEAVEN. WOW is it good. This is a must try for $2.50?

Had Yelp been working on my phone, I definitely would have wanted to come check this place out, but we ended up here anyway.   As others have said the sandwiches are super CHEAP for the strip ($6-ish each, although they dont come with chips or anything) and the breakfast sandwiches are around $4.    My boyfriend and I were both pretty happy with the sandwiches, although not wowed by them, and my boyfriend thought his sandwich was on the small side (he has a bottomless stomach though).    They let me add tomatoes to my egg & cheese breakfast sandwich for free, which was awesome!   Definitely recommend for breakfast or lunch if you don't want to go to buffet or spend a lot of money.     It's apparently a limited chain, and also has locations in DTW and BOS airports, so something to keep in mind for those of you who travel frequently!",

This deli is located in the mall of Planet Hollywood.  Once we stepped in, it was packed! I was worried there was no where for us to sit.  We looked at the menu and already, I was excited to try their sandwiches. I couldn't even decide what to get! Most of the sandwiches sounded very tastey! Unfortunately, I don't remember the name of my sandwich, but I know I got their most popular one and it was SUPER delicious! The bread was soft in the inside and crunchy on the outside! It just melts in your mouth! I think my bf got the Full Montague and he loveeed it too! I'm sure most of their menu is very good and the price isn't too bad.  I wanted to stop by here again on my last day in Vegas, but didn't have time. :( The great thing about this place is that they open 24/7! The first deli place i know that actually opens all day, everyday because most deli's close at 4pm from where I live. When you're in Vegas, this is the place to go!  :)",

I don't think I can say anymore good things about this place that all the other reviews have not already covered. This is definitely the best hot sandwich place I've had, and its OPEN 24 HOURS. Only two words can sum up this place, AFFORDABLE DELICIOUSNESS. Everyone raves about the sandwiches but the soups are phenomenal as well. The tomato soup with freshly baked croutons is perfection and I've heard that the cheese broccoli soup was great as well. My top 3 sandwiches are: Cannonballs (hot meatball sandwich), Tuna Melt, and The All American (Roasted Turkey, Buttermilk Ranch, Cranberries, Sharp Cheddar Cheese, Lettuce & Tomato). There is usually a line but it goes by fast, like less than 2 minutes fast. If you are looking for something quick and satisfying, this is the place to go for a quick meal. I never go to LV without hitting this place up, and you shouldn't either!",

I discovered this gem inside of Planet Hollywood awhile back and I make it a point to visit at least once every single time I'm in Vegas. There's nothing better than a hot sandwich when you've been drinking the night away.  I couldn't really tell you which sandwiches I've had since I've had most of them. My favorite and go to is usually the Hawaiian BBQ. Grilled chicken, roasted ham, cheese, BBQ sauce and fresh grilled pineapple. Seriously? Yeah it's fantastic.   If you go in November, please don't miss out on their holiday sandwich. Turkey, cranberry sauce, gravy, and stuffing. YES, STUFFING. I wish they had it year-round because then I could have Thanksgiving in my mouth year-round.  Earl of Sandwich has other items like soups, salads, wraps, desserts, but I don't care. It's all about that golden brick of deliciousness.",

The sandwich was hot and the bread was toasted just perfectly. The meat was tender and juicy at the same time with a little bit of the fatty flavor - yum. The best part was the creamy horseradish...made the sandwich 10x more delicious! Can't wait to try other choices (Tuna Melt, BLT, Full Montague)....get your fries fix somewhere else though.

    "text": "When you think of Las Vegas, you think about buffets. What trip to Sin City would be complete without one? That was my mentality  for the first ~30+ trips until I met Earl of Sandwich today.  For $5.99 (which is an extremely small price to pay considering the type of $$$$ you spend everywhere else on the Strip), you get a fusion baby (panini x subway) that is conveniently cut in two for you to share. Unlike subway, the bread wasn't soggy even with all the sauces + meats on them. It was slightly toasted/crunchy which is exactly how I like it! I ordered the Hawaiian BBQ, All American, Italian, and the Original, and since it was only 7:30AM in the morning, there was absolutely no line! We were in and out of Planet Hollywood within 10 minutes. ALL of the ones we ordered were pleasantly warm to the touch (FRESH!!!!) and deliciously fulfilling. The meats were perfect (and I usually don't like anything but chicken), the sauces were perfect; everything complimented each other and in perfect proportions. I know Hawaiian BBQ sounds a little questionable with BBQ sauce and pineapple, but it was my favorite! Don't knock it till you've tried it.  Best part? Open 24 freaking 7!  Worst part? It won't deter me from coming back, but the cashier working at the time had an incredibly bad attitude. It seemed as if she didn't want to be there (& I can't exactly blame her since it was so early), and when my brother didn't immediately take the pager (little black device that would signal to us that our order was ready), she DROPPED it on the table. My brother finally realized what had happened, and he thanked her anyway to which she sarcastically replied back. -1 star.",

    "text": "Happy 2011 everyone!  Hope everyone had a terrific NY celebration (nothing crazy and unsafe, yet extremely awesome and entertaining!)  Now the New Year is upon us, let me start off with a 5 star review for ya'll!  Earl of Sandwich... I've never really been a sandwich fanatic and this was all the rage prior to my recent last trip to Vegas by everyone I know and all the reviews posted on yelp.  On the day we were going to be leavin' LV I've decided to give it a shot by walking across the street for a quick brunch at Earl's.  Oh boy am I glad that I did just that!  You know... sandwiches are sandwiches.. nothing spectacular but nothing too horrible either... (a very safe type of food).  However, here at Earl's it's absolutely incredible on how they can possibly make things tastes so good!  Again due to my typical curiosity and the irresistible temptation on trying new things,  I've decided to almost but the entire menu for my food tasting lab I've set up in Bellagio.  (I end up getting the Full Montagu, Hawaiian BBQ, Caribbean Jerk Chicken, and the Earl Cobb Salad.)  The sandwiches were $5.99 each with a decent portion (ain't the size of subway but quality is much much better!), and with two drinks the total came out to like $31 and change...(slightly pricey in my mind but gotta give it a try)  I did share all this food with 3 other people though,,, so I not really the pig that I say I am.....  So here were our thoughts...  Full Montagu:  Great roast beef sandwich with turkey and swiss cheese... the roast beef was the real deal and it had the texture of soft arby's roast beef..... So taking that soft morsels that you call beef coupled with high quality you get an awesome sandwich!  Hawaiian BBQ:  I didn't get to try this as my friend devoured it down in a quick few minutes... so I'm gonna take that gesture as awesome and leave it as that!    Jamaican Jerk Chicken:  Jerk flavored chicken + roasted bell peppers in a jerk sauce made this sandwich really really delicious!  That's all I can tell you!  Yum!  Highlights of these sandwiches, the BREAD!  They toasted in a way where it's just the right moisture, the right texture, the right flavor, the right crispiness, and the right size overall!  It's just a really delicious bread to compliment all the dressings in between!  I've always believed that what makes a sandwich great is simply the bread itself, and Earl of Sandwich really proved that to be the main point!  Earl Cobb:  Aside from having slightly too much dressing that I would have liked (I always watch my dressing calorie count as this is the main trick in getting a salad), it was absolutely delicious!  I've have had many salads in various places, I gotta say that this is one of the more tasty salads for a fast food joint.  Definitely worth the price!  (The people I was with weren't even into salads and they really enjoyed that too!)  It's sort of weird that if you want ice tea you have to ask for it.... but you got the typical fountain drinks available for you (pepsi products)  One final note.... this place has recently updated their operational hours and it is now 24 hrs!!!  WOW!  That's so awesome!  So you're telling me when I'm hungry late at night working on them slots, I can get myself a sandwich to go, sit down at the slot, blackjack machine, or anywhere to be gambling and eating at the same time?  I Love Vegas!!!  So there you have it folks!  The first review of 2011 by yours truly and it is definitely a 5 stars in my mind.  So again hope everyone will be having a SUPER DUPER 2011 and if you do visit Vegas, may the money gods follow you to every machine/table you go to, and the sandwich gods guide you to Earl of Sandwich!",

    "text": "No BS, THE best sandwich I have ever had in my life. And it was even during my few sober hours in Vegas, so drinks had no influence on me and the pure pleasure of eating said sandwich. For the life of me, I cannot recall what sandwich I got, but from the reviews, it appears that I can't go wrong, and all will live up to the memory of that one perfect sandwich.  As is the rest of Vegas, this place is packed, loud, and sometimes full of drunks. Fine by me! I'm usually one of them! But the line does move quickly, and the eating area is clean. It's really not a bad spot to sit and enjoy the food with a few friends. The arrangement of the eating area makes it a little hard to cater to a larger group (if you move tables you block off the walkway, trashcans, etc).  I can't wait to return to Vegas and give this place another try. See if I can discover that magical sandwich again. I'm hopeful.",

It's the perfect meal for your empty stomach.   My favorite is the Club and the Caprese. I usually get 1 and my friend gets the other, and we trade one side. The combination of the Club and Caprese is perfect! The Caprese runs a little heavy on the balsamic vinegar, while the Club has a lot more of a hearty taste. Too much of one thing ruins the entire meal. So the half/half idea is a good one.  Chips + dessert. You're all set! Best deal in Vegas...",

I was debating between the Full Montagu and the All American: the All American won (this time) - loads of turkey, cranberry sauce, ranch dressing, lettuce, cheese and tomatoes.  The sandwich was packed with fillings. My friend said, \"It tastes like Thanksgiving\" and she definitely wasn't lying. One of the best parts about the sandwich was the bread: baked fresh everyday, it was crispy yet soft at the same time, and it really made the sandwich that much better.  After trying a bite of the Full Montagu, I think that sandwich would have been even better than the All American, which was good but not out of this world good.  It was a cheap, filling lunch, and with so many options to choose from, everyone is bound to find something they like. I would absolutely come back again.",

To end it all, the Godiva brownie ice cream sandwich with large chocolate chunks.

No one was giving me any information? Eventually I ask someone working there for my drink and show him my receipt. He tells me that they don't have any Earl's Grey Lemonade right now. Wait... what? I already paid! Being the nice person that I am I opted for an iced tea instead. I got no apology or compensation for the drink mishap and the wait. That turned me off a little bit.  Then I took a bite of my Caribbean Jerk Chicken sandwich. It was good, but not great. The sandwich was a little bit on the dry side. I liked the bread they served it on, but the chicken pieces weren't that juicy and whatever sauce they spread on the sandwich was not enough. They need to pack their sandwiches with more sauce so we can get some kind of flavor out of it.",

Y'all must be all intoxicated while eating this shit cuz this place tastes OK when you're sober.  I must admit the bean soup was really good though I was hella drunk while eating it. It was the only \"good\" taste that stood out. The line is definitely not worth the wait HAHA.  Props to them for opening 24 hrs. That's probably how they make so much money...charging drunktards (like me that night) for multiple sandwiches. I came back to the hotel with two bags of 2 sandwiches & 2 soups. Wtf.  It's good munchies food but for lunch? Nahhh I'd rather go to In n Out or Chinatown.",

I know.... food??  A highlight?  What the??  I'm sure all of the other sandwiches here are bomb, but as others here have mentioned.. the tuna melt is seriously off the freaking chain and was the best tuna melt I've had thus far.  It's made with fresh Albacore tuna salad & melted aged swiss cheese.. all in a delicious ciabatta type bread.  Oh so good.  The broccoli cheddar soup here was so so.. a little too thin for me, but screw it.  The sandwich gets an A+.  The line can get long, but no worries because it moves quickly.  This is definitely the spot to hit up when drunk after a club.  I'm definitely coming back next time.",

I was here just a week ago, excited as usual to get my yummy tuna melt and holiday turkey sandwich to share with my sister. I noticed something as soon as I got the sandwiches, they were much smaller than usual. I have been to Earl's more times than I can count. I've been to both this location and the one in Downtown Disney. So I knew for sure that something was off. I just thought to myself \"That's alright I guess, I don't need to be eating so much\". Then I noticed that the sandwiches were barely toasted, in fact, the holiday turkey was almost white in color. What the hell? I took a bite of the tuna melt first. It was decent, but nowhere near as good as it used to be. There was definitely less cheese and it seemed drier than I remembered. The contents of the holiday turkey was still pretty good, but the bread just wasn't toasted enough.   I'm just really sad that the quality of their product has gone down so much. I feel like whoever is higher up needs to realize that they are ruining their brand image by sacrificing the quality of their product for larger profit margins. Not sure if I really want to come back to this location unless there's a change.",

It's definitely better than subway, but it also reminded me a lot of quizno's.  Go ahead and boo me all you want with those comparisons, but that's what I felt like.  I had the chipotle chicken and it came out warm, melty, cheesy, and full of chicken, but for what I was paying for, it was kind of small, maybe a 6 inch sandwich. Perfect location inside the shops at Planet Hollywood, we saw many sober and not so sober folks enjoying their sandwiches.  Don't let the loud music from the bar across the way deter you late at night, or maybe it will guide you their way to keep on partying after you enjoy your sandwich late into the morning since they are open 24 hours.",

My first attempt to eat here was during Labor Day weekend around 1pm and the line was all the way out into the main Miracle Mile walkway. Massively hungover and running on empty there was no way I was going to wait in that long of a line. The next day at 4pm was much less crowded and we probably only had to wait in line for 3 minutes before placing our order. Quick turnaround with getting fresh hot sandwiches out after ordering too. All of the sandwiches sounded so good it was difficult to choose but I picked the Hawaiian BBQ and a frozen lemonade. I'll pass on the lemonade in the future, it was nothing special. The sandwich was great though. Stuffed full of ingredients, just half of one was large enough to fill my tummy.  Can't wait to make a return visit this weekend for my birthday to try more sandwiches (not gonna lie, I totally want to stock up and take some for the trip home).",

One day, we were near by and decided to give it a go because it was one of the only late night places open. The line actually moved pretty quickly, so I'll give them that.   The prices are a bit high, but it is Vegas. The sandwiches are an OK size and quality was fine, but it definitely is way over-hyped. This is not a 5 star sandwich joint.  You can't go wrong with a sammie from here, but it definitely wasn't memorable. Keep this on your radar when it's late in Vegas and you just want a decent bite to eat fairly quickly. The line moves quickly; just wait it out.",

It has an insanely high number of reviews and almost all of them are 5 star reviews!   I know The Earl doesn't need anymore good reviews but after my experience there on the morning of August 24th, I knew I had to write them a review.   Flashback to 2am at Tryst. The goose is flowing left and right! This is on top of several shots of 1800. By 4am, I'm a wreck! I yack and stumble down the strip. My system alerts me I'm hungrier than I am tired. I know there's only one location that can satisfy this hunger at 5am: The Earl of Sangwich!   I can barely stand as I enter The Earl. I blurt out some words which somehow the clerk behind the counter understood. I get my buzzer and wait for my sandwich. It starts buzzing and I retrieve it. I zombie-step back to my table and pass out.   I think an hour passes and I wake up. I can't find my sandwich anywhere. I go to the counter and say something happened to my sandwich (I have regained my ability to speak... sort of). They said just a minute and brought out my sandwich. They saw me passed out and took it to keep it warm for me!! This has to be one of the most awesome things a business has ever done!! Instead of kicking my sloppy ass out, they allowed me to sleep and kept my sandwich warm! What an outstanding business! I wish I could give them more than 5 stars!   BTW, the Thanksgiving sandwich was one of the best sandwiches in the world that night!   Bravo Earl!!",

    "text": "I've been to both this EoS at Planet Hollywood and the one in the food court at the Palms and they haven't let me down yet. The lines can get a little long at times, particularly at the end of peak clubbing/drinking hours since they're open 24/7(which is worth a bonus star in my opinion) and end up being one of a couple all night take out places midstrip. That being said the employees are usually friendly and efficient, and I've rarely had to wait more than about 10 minutes end-to-end.   The selection is excellent if a tad unadventurous, I particularly like The Original and the Holiday Turkey sandwich. They have a standard array of sandwiches which I tend to enjoy as designed by default, the vegetables are not a selling point but the meat and sauces are quality and the flavors tend to be well selected and complimentary; the binary choice between white and wheat bread leaves something to be desired. I'm not sure if this is a recent development but they have added a number of pasta dishes to their menu, the one that I tried, the Bacon Mac-and-Cheese, was surprisingly tasty, and could easily pass as a side at a significantly more expensive venue were it to be re-plated. I've also tried the salads there and they're passable, but ultimately forgettable. If you're looking for a dedicated seating area, you're liable to be disappointed.   For what it is, the EoS is a great stop for late night, or inexpensive anytime meals which are hard to find on the strip. If you want a consistent, known good, which is also filling, you should definitely give this place a try.",

Yeeee freshly roasted beef, cheddar cheese & creamy horseradish sauce. It was a perfect combination. The horseradish went well with errythangg.   My bf ordered the montagu sandwich which consisted of the whole shebang--freshly roasted beef, turkey, swiss cheese & cheddar cheese, lettuce, roma tomatoes & the Earl's mustard sauce. I think this was a little too heavy and too much for my appetite.  I was eye-ing on the turkey holiday sandwich but it seemed way too heavy for me. Next time fo'sho!   We also ordered their loaded potato soup which was very yummy! =)  I give this place 4.5/5. Dock of 1/2 a point for the wait =P But it's quick once you get to the front of the line and order your food.

Not only are they open 24 hours a day but they are sooooooo good and at such a reasonable price! $5.99 for most of the sandwiches.   I tried the Full Montague and once i took that first bite I instantly fell in love. The bread is so good and crispy on the outside but super soft on the inside. The sauce they used was unbelievable and the 2 meats and 2 cheese and tomato and lettuce fit perfectly all together. This place was so good that my 2 guy friends that came with me had to get in line again for seconds w/in 10 minutes.   The only downside is that there is a bit of a line to order but the sandwiches are made right away when you sit down. Seating is also a bit hard to look for but if you just stand around and look at people who are almost finishing you shouldn't have a problem.   MUST TRY PLACE!!!!!!!!!!!",

I have to say that it TOTALLY hit the spot.  We got lucky because we were able to get a table for our large group pretty quickly....  I thought at first that the samich might be overloaded because everyone who eats it is in a post-club, post-long-night-of-drinking state, so I saved half of my sandwich for consumption later.  Although a little cold, it was still EXTREMELY good!  I loved my samich, every last bite of it.  So if you're on the strip hitting this place up, post-club would be the worst time in the sense of how long the lines are, but hey, when you're hungry you're hungry, right?  But even then, the line moves quite quickly and we didn't have to wait too long.  Let's just assume that any Vegas Strip restaurant has bad parking(it's the strip) and that you're walking in from some other location.  Service - Good enough for a sandwich shop.",

It's Thanksgiving Day right now... & I couldn't care less about what I'll be eating in a few hours because all I want to do right now is to go back to Vegas and buy 100 of these Holiday sandwiches and freeze them because YES, it was THAAAAAT GOOD.  Turkey - goooooood. Stuffing - goooooood, Gravy - yummmmmmm, and top it off with Cranberry sauce - OMG ... I die and go to food heaven.   If you're in Vegas, I'm jealous. Eat this now.",

So far I tried: The Original- good, little salty The Full Montagu- meaty, yummy Cannonballs- great when hot, I do like my balls of meat!  Caprese- pretty good for a vege option cuz I got it twice!  Italian-super meaty, bit salty  Holiday Turkey Sandwich- i can't remember...  Pasta Salad- ok.   Earl's is also a good spot for people watching. Witnessed a late late night fight on the mall side between 3 women, 1 man, with a dozen or so spectators with camera phones in hand. Heels were off, purses were flying, people were angry. And no security in sight. Wasn't sure who would win, but I'll always put my money on Earl's. You can't go wrong.",

Fairly small and located within the planet hollywood casino, Earl of Sandwich makes an awesome roast beef sandwich that's unlike any other - it's almost a perfect nom nom nomish balance of roast beef, chedder cheese, and horseradish sauce. At 6 bucks, I consider this a really terrific value and would say you could definitely do worse at Subway for that price point.  I'm glad I listened to my friends about this place and would definitely not mind coming back here again to go for the other sandwiches. In fact, I want to.",

The seating isn't great since there's a constant line forming around and even a bit outside the hotel entrance.   I had the chipotle chicken sandwich with avocado and my boyfriend had the club. Both were really decent. I think mine was better just because the sauce gave a nice different flavor that the club was lacking. Of course, he begs to differ. Hmph. The toppings are okay but I wish that there was more of a neat viewing being that you can see everything from the line of ordering.   The pros is that the bread is like - uh, scrumcious! It's toasty but not too toasty to where the bread is left dry and boring! The meats seem fresh!   I'm definitely a fan and will try this place again.",

There was no line at midnight ;) and our order was processing within 10 mins. Food: 4/5 First time visiting here and ordered chicken chipotle avacado and veggie sandwich. I fell in love with the bread. Would definitely give 5/5 for that. Stuffing was good but nothing spectacular. Overall, good sandwiches that I wouldn't hesitate ordering again.",

So I ask... am I the last commoner in the kingdom that hasn't been to Earl of Sandwich?  It's funny because I'm acquainted with the Earls in the peerages of Britain and Ireland, but how come not on the Vegas strip, hmm? No clear answer but I haven't been to Vegas in like a decade. And although I've recently been to Vegas \"only\" 3 times in the past month, I've passed-by this Sandwich Cafe in the Miracle Mile Mall, and made the typical assumptions that good food is almost non-existent at a mall. Happy to note I'm totally wrong!  I'm at the mall and decided to get lunch and not just another cocktail for my left hand. I peruse Yelp and Earl of Sandwich pops up with the stats above. Hmm. Okay. Then I notice a sign (maybe a sign?) of a combo deal. Any sandwich and draft beer for a man-purse friendly $9.99. I had to give it a shot!   I enter and notice a million chairs (slight exaggeration), the casino to the left, and big screen TV's to the right. I'm going all-in on the combo meal... I order the French Dip and the Draft Beer. The clerk seems young and I ask what type of bread and what type of beer... her response white or wheat and I don't know what type of beer lol. Ok. Hey, for $9.99 who really cares at this point, right? Haha! And to clarify you don't have a choice of Draft Beers like I thought - it's Bud, bud! Haha! Nonetheless I'm to the point of no return and order!  I'm given a pager to notify me of my order, yet as soon as I find my seat, my order is ready! Fast! I pickup my lunch, my Bud already on the table... I take my bites. All delish! And a good hot sandwich sure makes a Bud tastes that much better!   All in all, I was pleasantly surprised with Earl of Sandwich and definitely recommend! It's of good quality for what you pay - maybe not the best ever, but again, if going back to affordable/quality/taste, this cafe at the mall hit it out! So maybe it's not as perfect as Prince Harry & Meghan, but hey, my only question left is when will I visit next... Cheers!",

EoS is that place you can visit any time of the day and their food is always good. Compared to the rest of the food in Vegas, the prices here are pretty reasonable. I always get the pepperoni pizza bread and a salad if I'm super hungry (around $15 for a decent portion of food) or if I'm in need of a snack, I'll order off the kids menu which is way cheaper but the portions are a little smaller but a good sized snack.  I have yet to try the hot sandwiches but they look bomb and my friends always rave about them. Tip: I would recommend this Planet Hollywood location rather than the Caesar's because the PH one has lower prices and more options. Overall, I cannot rave enough about this place! Try it!",

I find the service to be pretty quick even if there happens to be a line. If you go on off hours, you may find that there isn't a line at all! There are plenty of seats to wait too! They give you a tracker that will vibrate and flash when your food is ready for pickup, so you can go off and sit down instead of waiting for your name to be called.  My go-to sandwich is the Thanksgiving Turkey Cranberry one (don't remember exactly what it was called), but it's always delicious! Portions are just right and the prices aren't ridiculous.

I know that this isn't very vegas-y (no glitz and glamour here), but sometimes when you are on the strip all you need is a quick and easy meal in between all of your gambling and partying. It is located by the ABC store inside Planet Hollywood.  My go to sandwiches are the Italian, chipotle chicken, and the cannonball (meatball). However on my last visit, it looked like the cannonball sandwich is no longer on the menu. Bummer! Sandwiches run you about $7 and you can add a fountain drink and a bag of chips for $3. Probably the best fast food meal you can get for that price on the strip.   This location is open 24/7 so there can be quite a line after the club. Breakfast sandwiches, wraps, and wings are now part of their everyday menu. A great pick me up meal after a night of drinking. Gotta get your carbs on!",

    "text": "Earl of Sandwich is one of my essential Las Vegas Strip staples. Why? Because of quality food, reasonable pricing, and consistency.   When wandering about the large establishments in Las Vegas, you sometimes find yourself hungry at odd times of day--many times after midnight! If you're lucky enough to be at Planet Hollywood (Caesar's or the Palms) during this sort of event, Earl of Sandwich is a solid choice.   On this particular visit, it was an average time of day to eat lunch. One of us ordered a wrap which she enjoyed immensely, and I ordered one of the sandwiches they are famous for, the Full Montagu. The Montagu is a lovely combination of roasted beef, turkey, Swiss, cheddar, lettuce, Roma tomato & mustard sauce. The making of these sandwiches occurs upon ordering, and they take some time crafting the sandwiches to their standards (in other words, don't expect fast-food levels of order fulfillment). The flavor and the arrangement of this sandwich add to the delight in texture. I also had a bowl of tortilla soup, and my co-diner had the broccoli cheddar soup. If you like broccoli cheddar soup, this one is a real winner. The tortilla soup is good but not wondrous.   There's plenty of seating, complimentary water, HP Sauce on every table, and the place is kept clean. Pay attention to the ordering process because it's unusual for this type of restaurant--your order first, walk along the counter to look at all the goodies you can add on, then pay at the end of the counter. They give you buzzers to alert you when your meal is ready to eat.   Overall, I love Earl of Sandwich and will continue to keep it on my (very short) list of reliable quick-service restaurants in Las Vegas. ",

That came up to about $13 dollars (not bad, right?!) and they arrived quickly.  I was told I ate most of it, and didn't stop praising how awesome the food was, and that we should order some more food.  I don't think I did, but I should have because from where I am, the Vegas location is the nearest one to me.  I'm a little sad now, and can't wait to make another trip to Vegas in the near future for some more food, and a buzz!",

I had the Mediterranean Chicken Salad in a wrap (you can get any of the salads in a wrap).  It was so much better than other Greek style wraps I have had. Firstly the wrap itself was nice and thick and full of flavor, not just one of those boring tortilla wraps a lot of sandwich shops use. Secondly, they were very liberal with the kalamata olives and the roasted red peppers - usually I find that budget friendly places skimp on those kinds of ingredients.   My friend ordered the Turkey Club Sandwich and creamy tomato soup.  The bread on the sandwich was really, really good! It was thick and hearty with lots of flavor, and slightly toasted - loads better than anything you could find at Quizno's or Slobway.....  The tomato soup was delicious. I was hesitant to try it because they add croutons to it before serving, so I thought it would be a soggy mess....I was wrong!  The croutons were very large and perfectly crusty and held up well in the hot soup.  I would recommend Earl of Sandwich to anyone looking for a quick, satisfying, and inexpensive lunch near the mid-Strip. For two sandwiches and a soup, our total was under $20.",

    "text": "They sure know how to make a fantastic sandwich here at the Earl of Sandwich.  If you have sandwich in your name you better not disappoint.  I've been to multiple locations and also been to this one in Planet Hollywood a bunch of times.   Once you get to the register you only place your food order in with the team member.  You then get your buzzer and slide down to the next register where you actually pay for any food items or drinks that you have decided to buy.  This trip I got The Earl's Club and The Full Montagu.  When you order your sandwich you get the choice of white or wheat bread.  What they do a great job of since these are two hot sandwiches, is that the bread is toasted so it gives it that extra bite to the food. It also allows all the flavors of the sandwich components to stay together.    The Earl Grey Lemonade at the beverage bar is amazing! It's like their rendition of an arnold palmer with earl grey tea.  Where have you been all my life?  I must have missed this on previous visits but now I know I can't skip this.  It's not overly sweet where you have regret afterwards but you can taste the earl grey tea as well as the lemonade playing off one another.",

Downside is the portions are small for hungry ppl. I usually get full off of a small tomato soup and half sandwich. They I devour the other half after I get back to the room from the clubs hehe.",

My go to sandwich will always be the holiday turkey as it reminds me of Ike's version (thanksgiving leftovers) up here in the bay area. The sandwich comes with thin slices of turkey, stuffing, gravy, cranberry sauce and mayo combined to make a delicious sandwich and if you have sriracha try adding some, it goes so well together.  usually i have no problems with ordering and getting my food to scarf it down but i guess my order got lost somewhere during the transaction. As i seen most of my group receive their sandwiches i went up to the counter with my receipt to ask if my order was coming. Apparently something happened and they didn't make the sandwich, but they quickly remedied the problem and made me my sandwich at a faster pace and i was enjoying my holiday turkey as if nothing happened.   Really good sandwiches if you're on the strip and i would recommend it. the line may seem pretty long but the ordering process is extremely fast and simple you just order your sandwich you get a ticket go down the line pick up your chips if you got the meal and pay.",

Mildly inebriated (wait, is that tipsy?)  Whatever your state of mind, there is always an opportunity to enjoy a Full Montague or Chipotle Chicken Avocado, and sip on some of that tomato soup. I've been to other Earl locations and this one consistently reigns on top. Even when the line seems long, they're still able to accommodate all parties pretty quickly.  Never change Earl.

I ordered the special - Caribbean Jerk Chicken sandwich....major bust. Where did all the veggies go for a sandwich?! However, the veggie sandwich here is just solid. I actually prefer that over the chicken subs any day! The breakfast sandwiches are super yum and if you like a nice kick to it, add a few splashes of Tabasco and boom - culinary creation upgraded!

But when I saw the menu, I was blown away the sandwiches were only $6.49 each (for most) and after we ordered our sandwiches and were given the buzzer vibrating reservationg thing, about 3 minutes later we got our order!  We had the Holiday Turkey, a Earl Club and a cup of Clam chowder! They were all banging. Starting with the Holiday Turkey, the bread was hot, soft and kinda buttery and it was stuffed with a whole holiday turkey meal, from cranberry jelly to the cornmeal stuffing. Delish! The Earl Club was just as fantastic with the same delicious bread and great crispy bacon, its what a club sandwich should be like. The clam chowder was good too, not the best, but definitely not bad.  The portions were perfect too, if you ddin't want to be gluttonous, then the portion size is perfect, you should be full or almost full and if you wanted to stuff your face with dessert somewhere else or get some drinks after you still have room.

Here's what you need to know:  Chipotle Chicken Avocado - 4.0/5  More chipotle sauce would've made it a 4.5. Be sure to ask for extra (trust me). Dryness is a theme at Earl, beware. Liked that the chicken wasn't processed. Avocado was excellent.  Italian - 3.5/5   A little salty but very tasty. Some vegetables would have made it a 4. Almost tastes like a gourmet pizza because the meats mimic a pepperoni flavor, it has mozzarella, and it's served warm.  Full Montagu - 3.5/5  Pretty good, but kind of a typical processed meat sandwich. Also suffered from dryness. Required more mustard.  Pro tip: if you're into pepperoncini, ask for a side of it. It's free and adds another dimension of flavor.  Summary: If you're looking for one of the best value meals on the Las Vegas strip, look no further!",

We ordered the Full Montague sandwich, Buffalo Chicken Wrap and Broccoli and Cheddar soup.    Full Montague, did get my belly really full, this sandwich was definitely loaded with Roast beef, Turkey, cheese, and mustard sauce.  I opted out the tomato (not a fan), I am not a sandwich fan neither but this sandwich was really good and tasty.    Buffalo chicken wrap - was just okay, nothing to rave about, so I will leave it as that.  Broccoli and Cheddar soup - was yummers!  Price is very affordable for a great sandwich!  (We actually came back here 2x when we were in LV)  We will definitely come back again if we are in the area.",

A great option for a quick, affordable bite to eat, this has been a favorite for many years now.  To be honest, I never even really liked sandwiches that much until I tried Earl's (Mendo's also gets some credit). Everything I've tried here is legit, but the Full Montague is by far the best.  It's also super convenient, open 24 hours, so you can eat good food at any time and it's easy on your probably-already-light-wallet from playing too much paigow. During mealtimes, it can get crowded though.  I haven't tried the Anaheim location yet, but this Vegas one is still a trusty go-to.",

The sandwiches I've had here are all good (I usually get the Earl Club or Full Montagu). Once the buzzer sounds, they come out warm in the shimmering foil sealed with the logo sticker, and, once opened, the crunch of that bread and its sandwiched ingredients convert hunger into satiety. The house branded potato chips are pretty good, too.  I don't mind the lines and crowds here; there are still plenty of tables to sit at and you can read the history of  the Earl of Sandwich on the restaurant walls as you wait. Somehow the historical reminder makes the visit feel that bit more special once indulging into your food. I've tried the one in Anaheim, it's not the same. This is the one to go to. I wouldn't think to stop at Caesars either.  Always a fan of Earl of Sandwich. Thank you, Sir Montagu, for your contribution to the foodie universe.",

I even opted to add avocados in the mix. <a href=\"/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2Fsu.pr%2F7vuRe6&s=2500c9fd5517c330d1a3477a61e018ad99c376ea344968d32b08c13e894c6178\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">su.pr/7vuRe6</a>  Sounds like a simple sandwich, right?

    "text": "Came here for lunch on Tuesday. Minimal wait, prices cheap for being on the Strip (7-8 bucks/sandwich).  Had the Montagu and the Italian. The Montagu was perfect with the combo of melt in your mouth roast beef and cheese. The flavor was balanced with every component so it wasn't salty at all, even at your last bite.   Italian was still very good, just not as perfect as the Montagu. Italian normally would be very salty due to all the salami but this one only has a light salt kick. Personal preference would be a tad more tomatoes but still good.   The bread on both sandwiches were perfect. Slightly crispy on the outside with soft and fresh inside.   The sandwich size is a lil small for my taste. I wouldn't mind paying another dollar for a slightly bigger sandwich. If you order the meal or a side, then the portions would be perfect.   So I took a star away because the person who took my sandwich order was impatient. She tried up-selling me to the meal (drink and chips). When I mentioned I was interested in a soup instead, she replied as if I could substitute the soup into the meal. When I tried to confirm this, while saying to my partner I wouldn't need a drink (that I was gonna give him instead), she removed the meal add on from my order and ushered me down the line instead. I would've gotten the soup/meal but decided not to after that.",

    "text": "Every other time before this current trip to Vegas I would have given Earl's 5 stars. Let me explain...I am a regular here in Vegas coming about almost every 2-3 months. Earls is my go to place every single time. One being they are right within the hotel I stay at (Planet Hollywood/Elara), two being they are 24 hours, and number reason being they are the best sandwiches on earth! the tuna melt and Hawaiian BBQ are my top choices while I do very much enjoy all the other kinds! Trust me I want to give this place five stars but here is what got me to give only 4. This current trip that I'm on I haven't had the best experience...apparently since they are open 24 hours they need to \"refresh\" their system (registers and what not) which is totally understandable. BUT they pick the worse time to do that...12 am, the time that most are heading to earls! And it causes this 10-15 minute wait which feels like forever when you're hungry!!!!!!!!!!! Another reason for me is that even during regular hours of the day the service seems to be so much slower. I find myself constantly having to repeat my Order cause it seems like they don't pay attention the first 3 times and they just seem out of it...then down the line the sandwiches are prepared much slower than usual and I notice this is because the employees spend too much time laughing and joking around causing (from my experience) a bunch of errors in orders and it takes so long for it to be ready! And it can get very frustrating! Despite the delay sandwiches seems to have gotten smaller as far as the filling it's much more less than it use to be. Over all yes I will continue to be a regular here and always be. I love love love love earls here at the Planet Hollywood but there can definitely be improvements!!!!",

Location and price: You're in the middle of Miracle Mile Shops here people, ish is expensive everywhere you look and the sandwiches here are decently priced for anywhere on the Las Vegas Strip.  2. Other Nearby Choices: usually tend to be not the greatest in quality or taste. These sandwiches are made with good bread and tasty meats and condiments. other choices within walking distance are just not as good.  3. Open 24 Hours: This place has great reviews at first glance, and Yeah, ok...the sandwiches are good, but is it one of the best sandwiches I've ever had?? No way! Is it in the top 3? Definitely not! How about the top 10 at least?...maybe if I was drunk.  oh what? It just hit me. How many of the people who reviewed this joint probably stumbled here after getting out of the clubs and ate a sandwich while pissing their pants drunk? Probably aaaa lot!  And we all know food taste better 3 ways. When you're stoned and when you're drunk. or when you're outdoors camping/bbq'ing.  Since the later is just not possible inside a casino resort and I don't get stoned, that only leaves drunk. This sandwich would taste amazing drunk. so I guess my point is, eat here drunk.",

Its located inside the Miracle Mile Mall so its always great to stop by after some shopping. They just recently i believe made it a 24hr spot! So after partying it up at Marquee on Saturday night we stopped by for a late night/early morning bite and i ordered the Tuna and a friend ordered the All American, we split the sandwiches to give ourselves variety.  The Tuna was good but a little too much for my liking, the All American was delicious and the cranberry's give it personality and a homey taste for a turkey sandwich.",

    "text": "Second time here. Grilled cheese for my four year old - ok, but not great. Italian for my wife - excellent sandwich. The original sandwich for me - good plain, but really good with a little dash of salt and some Grey Poupon - which they have available there.  In New York, this place would only rate a three or four star, but being that this is in Vegas, and it's relatively inexpensive, I will go ahead and give them all five stars.  I would like to point out that this review was during my third trip to Vegas this year.  I don't particularly like Vegas, and all three of my trips were related to me needing to go to vegas for the sake of other people.  In general the food in Vegas at this price point is terrible, so I was really happy to find a casual, inexpensive, relatively not so artery clogging option.    Yes, you can pay much more and go to a nicer restaurant, but that option is $30+ per person ($45+ if you want a drink or two).  At the $30+/$45+ (no booze/booze) price point, I've been to a couple of nice restaurants in Vegas and from the numerous favorable yelp reviews, I don't think decent to very good food at the higher price point is much of a challenge.  I don't know about great food like you can fine in San Fran or NY, but pretty good food nonetheless.  Also, I suggest that you Avoid the buffets, even the pricier & nicer one - i don't care which buffet you go to, the food will be meh at best.  I speak from experience, my fellow yelp friends.  Last thing I want to point out about the Earl - there is a convenience store right around the corner where you can buy booze (hard liquor and beer singles) at a relatively good price.  If you want a drink, I would suggest that you pick it up at the convenience store before you get in line at the Earl.",

They have great sides, desserts, and is fast and great. You can eat be full under $10. Where else can you do that! I am so glad they added one of these in Vegas and now we just got one in Arizona. If you need a cheap quick meal on the go this is the place.",

Second server asks what drinks you want, grab whatever bottled drinks you want on the way or tell them what sized drink you want to along with paying at second server. -Second server gives you a buzzer and receipt. Hold on to the receipt when picking up your order! -Sit down and wait for your buzzer and your golden brick!!  PROS -Not bad for $5-$6 dollar sandwich, I always order 2 or 3 to take home. -Fast service, never a long wait for your sandwich -Self-serve drinks -Sit where ya' want to eat!

But last weekend, the line actually didn't look like a complete nightmare at 3 in the morning. I was so excited to finally give this place a try.   After standing in line for 15 min and waiting another 5 minutes for my sandwich, I was finally able to sink my teeth into one of these famous sandwiches that I've heard so much about. I ordered the chipotle chicken sandwich with avocado. It was SOOO good. The bread was really fresh and soft. The chipotle flavor was bold and delicious. The warm gooey cheese was excellent. The combinations of textures and flavors worked so well and made the sandwich so great.   I also tried the tomato soup. It was ok. I thought it tasted a little bit like canned soup. Nothing special.   Service here is friendly and efficient. There are a lot of tables, but seating did seem a little  limited since there were so many customers.   The sandwiches here really are superb. Great food after a long night of partying.  I will definitely be back on my next Vegas trip :D",

Next to PF Chang's, this sandwich shop is definitely the Earl of sandwiches.  The bread is warm, chewy, perfect in texture and they have a variety of choices!  Per Shanon's suggestions, we got the original (roast beef) and chipotle avocado chicken.  At $6.49 a piece, you can't beat the price and the quality of the sandwiches here!  We actually went back later and got a salad but it was nothing special.  More like the kind of you get in grocery stores when the lettuce is very dry and tasteless, so avoid the salads.  We went back again before our flight took off and got the Holiday Turkey and Tuna Melt to take with us on the plane as our evening meal.  Even though they cooled down by the time we boarded, both were still unbelievably tasty!    If you are on the Vegas strip and looking for a cheap meal that still tastes good, come here!  They have lots of seating available and open 24 hours!  The only thing is that I wish they offered a vegan option, I think that would make me give them a million stars!",

Real tears.  In all seriousness, Earl of Sandwich, located inside Planet Hollywood near PBR Rock Bar & Grill, catered to me and my cousins' both drunk and sober needs -- and for the inexpensive price of $6.49 (as of Sept. 7, 2014), might I add.  My \"gold bars\" from my last few visits include Avocado BLT and the Holiday Turkey.  The Avocado BLT is packed with a ton of itty bitty bits of bacon and a generous serving of avocado. With the toasted, crunchy bread and my addition of some Grey Poupon... ugh. Just writing about it makes my stomach grumble.  The Holiday Turkey sandwich has the fixits of a leftover sandwich the day after Thanksgiving. The sandwich includes slices of turkey, mayo, stuffing and cranberry sauce. REALLY delicious! This sandwich is the epitome of filling your drunchies.  I also managed to grab a side of their potato salad. It wasn't that great; it tasted what you'd expect in a potato salad. However, the portion is small for the price you're paying, so don't bother.  The staff here are a hit or miss. Most of them are friendly, but during one of our visits, the lady taking our sandwich order literally didn't say a word. I told her my sandwich, and before I could ask for a side, she prints out my order receipt and took the next customer. Uh, okay.  All in all, Earl of Sandwich delivers a bang for your buck. Huge props for keeping this place open 24 hours. If you need a bite and you're near Planet Hollywood, definitely give this place a try.",

But if you need a sandwich and are debating between one here or a premade wrapped up one at ABC Stores(ewww), go here and don't even bother with the ones at ABC. It wasn't the greatest sandwich place I've been to before, but decent enough. I'd say Potbelly is better, but it'll do the hunger relief trick fine if you're in Planet Hollywood/Miracle Mile, and don't want Chipotle.  I don't remember the details about the sandwiches I ordered closely anymore, but except for 1 visit where I felt my sandwich was a little off(edit: sigh I see Yelp didn't record all my attempts to check-in here, over the several visits I definitely did here), my sandwiches were decent. And considering the prices of a lot of other places within Planet Hollywood/Miracle Mile and the rest of the Strip, the prices aren't bad. Check it out if you happen to be near Planet Hollywood Casino or in the nearby vicinity, but I wouldn't go out of your way to eat here. If Yelp allowed half stars(please allow this already? it should've been done years ago), I'd give them 3.5.",

This Earl is so much more amazing due to the fact that it's open 24 hours!!  Lines can get long, but move pretty fast.  Their ordering system is efficient and speedy.  Bread is delicious and the types of sandwiches they offer all compliment really with with the ingredients they use.  Nothing crazy intense here like mozarella sticks or overly saucy sandwiches.  What they offer is popular flavors made to perfection.  All the sandwiches Ive had here have tasted top notch, no matter when I go.  Italian, holiday turkey, and the classic all tasted good.",

Compared to bustling glamour of the Vegas buffets and other expensive dining choices, Earl of Sandwich delivers a fantastic assortment of sandwiches in the heart of the Strip.  With my entourage I was able to try the Caprese, 1762 Original and Tuna Melt.  Admittedly the sandwiches themselves were nothing spectacular on the palate, but Earl of Sandwich wins four out of five purely on the value that you are getting from the quality of these six dollar sandwiches worthy of Vegas's demanding taste buds.",

I don't know but if you're up to it, definitely order the sandwich plus this soup.  The line is always long, but the wait for the food to be prepared is pretty short.

It's not worth rehashing crazy nights because you'll find out things about yourself that will haunt you for the rest of your life.   Instead of all that, just remember that inside the PH, is the Earl of Sandwich.  A warm, comforting place that will rock your world, soul, socks and anything else that is worth rockin'.   The EoS is the spot that will kill your inner beast (better than del taco) with a heavenly sandwich.  A while back, I stumbled into this place and ordered a Caprese sandwich and fell in love. Ever since, I make an extra effort to come out to the EoS for a sandwich. Yes, it's worth my effort to valet park at a Strip hotel, just for a sandwich.  Some highlights:  1. The bread. Fantastic crust, remarkable chewy dough, and a solid undertone of flavor. Blends well with any sandwich. 2. Solid ingredients. Tomatoes, lettuce, etc. None of that stuff is wilted, gross or mossy. Can't say that about most sandwich shops on and off the strip (ahem SUBWAY). 3. Menu. There is something for everyone on this menu, and the sandwich creations are very creative. The Original 1762, Cannonballs, Hawaiian BBQ.  Hungry yet? Yeah? That's what I thought. You know where to go.",

Perfect blend of tea flavor and tartness from the lemonade without being overly sweet like most places.",

After eating Earl's seasonal holiday turkey sandwich, stomach-warmingly  made with stuffing, cranberry sauce and gravy...mmMmMMmmmm..super tasty!  It was like hitting an unexpected jackpot out of nowhere at a slot machine... or placing a random field bet on craps when the shooter rolls 12.  WOOT!  Awesome way to end a Vegas trip after chowing down at all the buffets.  No line at 11am, plenty of flexible seating, and cheAP!!!   For all I know, it could've been some rich casino owners leftovers, but man it was yum!",

    "text": "I am a regular to Vegas and the vegas food scene, which is comprised mainly of: expensive gourmet dining ($120 and up for 2 range), or overpriced mediocre dining (chain restaurants such as Outback, whose prices are inflated because of its \"on the strip\" location, and rainforest cafe) and cheap fast food joints (prices still inflated from what they'd normally charge if not on the strip.. the panda express, mc'dees, rubios, S'barro pizza).   On my last trip to Vegas, i decided that i wouldn't be a sucker anymore. I wanted to have a good meal, at a reasonable price, and if i have to walk half the strip, then so be it. I searched on yelp and Earl of Sandwich came up. A deja-vu moment came back, since I've been to Planet Hollywood before and recalled having briefly seen this spot, not far after you enter the hotel/ casino. I trekked my way from MGM to PH, for this. Worth the 82 degrees heat, and the 15 min walk. And alas, i can't place Earl in any of the 3 categories of the Vegas dining scene. I guess i am mentally creating a new category: good & cheap! (I believe Earl's is a chain, but it's too good to be put in the same league as the other chain restaurants).   It was just the 2 of us, but since I wanted to give a fair review of the food, we got 3 sandwiches for variety: the Full Montagu, The Ham 'n' Swiss and The All American. The Full Montagu is my favorite, with just the right amount of meat (roast beef and turkey), 2 types of cheese (swiss and sharp cheddar) and a good slab of the house mustard sauce.The All American is like thanksgiving on a sandwich (it has cranberries, turkey, cheese). The ham and swiss is the most boring choice of the 3, but it's good quality ham n' cheese sandwich.   You do have to get chips or any other sides for additional cost, as they aren't included in the $5.95 price (for all sandwiches!). They get packed. But other than that, it's a solid spot.",

I went at a time that there were plenty of happy drunks going around saying hi and saying sorry and telling me to go buy some scotch... yeeah, I love drunk people!!   Okay, enough about PH and drunks... the sandwich. I got the Italian and it was simply good. I wouldn't get it again because their menu has a lot more to offer! I like the fact that these are reasonable priced sandwiches at $5.99 and they come out hot and warm!! This place is simple, the food is good. And its location is even better.   I probably wouldn't drive here just to go here, but if I'm in the neighborhood, or I'm looking for a yummy sandwich at 3:00AM, then yes, I will definitely be back to Earl.",

I've tried the Veggie Sandwich - very, very fresh with an almost Mediterranean taste.  The Full Montagu is my absolute favorite sandwich as of right now. They juicy and thinly sliced turkey breasts as well as roast beef just melts in your mouth as you bite into crisp lettuce and tomatoes. Top it off with some extra Dijon mustard & tabasco sauce and I am in H.E.A.V.E.N.  The sandwiches are ~$5.99  I sometimes get a bowl of Tomato soup (which looks red on the screen, but comes out orange when you take off the lid). I think they mix a lot of cheddar cheese with the tomato soup because it's super creamy & rich. They put a bunch of croutons in the soup bowl so when you open the lid they are swimming in front of your face =)  AHHH Earl of Sandwich.... until we meet again.",

I stayed at Planet Hollywood on my recent Vegas trip, so Earl of Sandwich was my typical lunch (because I never woke up early enough for their breakfast menu that's served until 11 AM.. boo!)  I tried the BLT, The Earl's Club (Turkey and Bacon), Italian and The Full Montagu (Roast Beef and Turkey). Amazingly, all of the sandwiches were seriously good. I'm not sure which was my favorite, as they all were equally tasty... but since I'm a bacon lover, it'd probably have to be the Earl's Club.   Highly recommend all of their sandwiches and will continue going here on my future trips to Vegas for a quick bite.   Skip their tempting cupcakes and cookies at checkout though. Waste your calories on the million other Vegas pastry shops. Shamefully, I tried the sugar cookie, chocolate chip cookie, brownies and the red velvet cupcake. All extremely generic tasting. The frosting on the cupcakes were super sweet like canned frosting and the cookies are made with margarine instead of butter, which is never a good thing for chocolate chip cookies. Or any cookies for that matter. ;)",

One to take your order, and to hand you a buzzer, and as you keep going through the line, they have drinks, chips, parfaits, fruits, and desserts to your left to get if you want it.

    "text": "Love love love this place! It is only fitting that a sandwich the menu be named after the Montagu legacy.  John Montagu, 4th Earl of Sandwich, apparently loved to gamble (nice we have a couple locations then huh?) and after playing 24 hours straight, he asked the cook to make him something easy to hold in one hand and eat and the other hand could be free to play cards. He was brought 2 pieces of bread with meat in between it. This is the story I got from the restaurant, seems maybe the cook actually invented it?! I first went to Earl of Sandwich in California at Downtown Disney and really enjoyed it so I was happy when we got an EOS!   I can't believe it is only about $6 per sandwich! It tastes so fresh and yummy. I can easily eat just one and be full but my hubby does need 2 to get full. I like the \"Full Montagu\" which has  Freshly Roasted Beef, Turkey, Aged Swiss & Sharp Cheddar, Lettuce, Roma Tomatoes & the Earl's Mustard Sauce. I have them hold the lettuce (just my personal preference).  If you are not a meat eater they have a couple sandwiches for you called the \"veggie\" and \"caprese\" and a variety of soups. I like the \"Wisconsin Cheddar\" for the soup it is really tasty.  The next thing I am going to try is one of their wraps. I do want to mention the line is sometimes very long but I promise you that it moves very quickly. You can even bring your own soda or stop at a gas station and get something if you wanted to save a bit and not pay for one of theirs.",

Anytime you are hungry or craving one of their delicious sandwiches you must come here.  I missed the holiday turkey sandwich so much that I ate one for lunch and 2 more on my last day. One for breakfast and one for the road. The holiday turkey has stuffing, cranberries, gravy and mayo I think. All I know is that I really love this sandwich. Their chipotle chicken sandwich is awesome too. It has chicken, bacon, avocado, lettuce and tomato with a chipotle sauce.  I wasn't able to try their strawberry shortcake until my last day here since they are so popular and run out quick. It was freaking good. I would buy several of these next time.  If there's one bad thing I have to say about this place it's the prices. Kinda pricey as well as the sandwich size being a bit too small for my standards. Overall though I love this place.",

First of all, the line here can be pretty ridiculous, especially during the lunch rush. Go grab a Fat Tuesday if you have to, cause in the end it will be all worth it. You wait in the first line to order your sandwich. Then you move onto the second line (yay...!) for drinks, chips, and dessert. Once you grab what you want, you finally pay and they give you one of those electric buzzer things that vibrates when your order is ready.  My favorite sandwich - hands down is the Full Montagu. Roast beef, turkey, Swiss cheese, lettuce, and tomatoes. I am drooling just thinking about it! I've had probably most of their hot sandwiches. They are all pretty darn delicious, so you really can't go wrong.",

It was great, perfectly warm, yet the lettuce was still cool and crisp.  That is an accomplishment.  They even let me try the tomato soup before I ordered it.  It was really good too, but I know it has dairy in it.  Its too creamy to be vegan( I'm not vegan, just warning you).   Its a major value in an expensive city( on the strip) too.  12.00 for a sandwich, soup and chips.  Be warned though, they only have pepsi products.",

Located right next to the casino and edge of the shopping area, it gets a lot of traffic and there's always been a line. Takes a good 10 minutes to get my food but it's so worth it! They give you a buzzer so you can find a seat while waiting.   The best part about the sandwiches is the bread! The focaccia-like bread is crispy on the outside, chewy on the inside and is amazing once toasted. I would go back just for the bread!!   My favorite is the Chipotle Chicken Avocado: zesty chipotle sauce gives the grilled chicken a bit of a spicy kick while the avocado, bacon, and lettuce adds texture and flavor. I've also tried the Club, which is also delicious! You can't go wrong with any of the hot sandwiches!",

But I didn't stop in for the salad.  I wanted a good sandwich.  And that isn't what I got.  I ordered a hot roast beef sandwich.  (I believe it's called 'The Original'.)  The first bite was all gristle.  So was the second -- throw in a vein or two.  Why I didn't return this mess is beyond me.  Instead, I filled the bread, which was actually pretty good, with the salad -- and paid too much for what amounted to lettuce and tomato on bread.",

I was at a party Thursday night at my friends frat (he goes to UNLV), and one of the kids there kept talking about the Tuna Melt, and it stuck with me so much that the next day I went and got one. Damn. How else can I elaborate? It was beautiful. Amazing, delicious, satisfying, cheap, perfection between two slices of bread. The service is fast for the long lines. The sandwiches, and I'm sure it doesn't matter which one you get, are insanely magical. I'm salivating just thinking about them. Oh and best thing...THEY'RE OPEN 24/7. Damnit San Diego we are missing a really good thing out here. I'd drive all the way back just for a sandwich from Earl's. That's how freaking delicious these things are. The bread, the ingredients, how they're made; I don't know what it is but whatever they're doing warrants 5 damn Michelin Stars. Come here, If you don't fall in love then please, stop eating food altogether because you have no idea what excellence in the culinary world is, even if it's as simple as a sandwich.",

The potato soup is also really good, must try!!Also, what I like about this place is that you can either have your salad in a tortilla wrap or in a bowl, and they both cost the same too!

Honestly, when I first saw the fast-food-like service and their takeout bags for all orders, I was a bit disappointed that I had to work so hard to get here. But seriously, don't judge a book by it's cover, I know so cliche, but seriously. You taste the food and you overlook everything.   I had the chicken avocado wrap and it's perfect if you want a bomb-ass salad in a wrap. I personally hate greasy, and this was a great choice!  My friend was dead tired, but one bite out of the tuna melt, and it kicked the tired outta him.   Even the pizza bread on the kids' menu was pretty good.  Go! Now!",

After the 2nd day raging hard, wow........ just wow........ it's sooooooooooo good. The best cheapest sandwich I've had in my 24 years of existence. When the buffets and restaurants overwhelm you in Vegas, this is your saving grace! I would pay $30 for this sandwich even if it's not on a plate.   One thing I don't understand - there's a location in Paris, UK, and Qatar, but NONE in Northern California?! Someone give me $500k and I'll open one in the Bay (YAY) Area!   Btw, we got the Full Montagu, Tuna Melt and Hawaiian BBQ. My favorite is the Full Montagu of course, followed by the Hawaiian BBQ. I had the tuna melt when it wasn't fresh anymore (we bought 3 to eat later) and it was still good, but could've been better if it was fresher.   There was plenty of seating when we went because it was 6 or 7 in the morning.   'Til next time Earl!",

Chipotle Chicken Avocado. Chipotle Chicken Avocado. Say it a few more times so you will remember to get Chipotle Chicken Avocado. If you are a fan of avocado, this is the sandwich for you. The savory chipotle sauce goes perfectly well with avocado and diced chicken breast. I can devour the entire thing in less than 5 minutes, not even kidding.

I got the Full Montague with roast beef, turkey, plus Swiss and cheddar cheese. It was unremarkable and I didn't feel like the sandwich held up well.

Overall, a great, affordable place to eat in Vegas if you're in the area. It can be quick too, depending on when you go.

It's perfect for a late night snack or if you need food to soak up all that alcohol.  Yes, I said the sandwiches are hot here.  I know you're thinking that sandwiches were meant to be cold, but these sandwiches were just meant to be hot. The end.  I ordered the Italian sandwich which contains salami, capicola, ham, mortadella, ,mozzrella cheese, roma tomatoes and Italian dressing.  The sandwich was fresh and just melts in your mouth for $6.  The sandwich is average size, but someone with a big appetite will probably be hungry after one sandwich.  The meat and toppings were not that generous, but let's be real most food places in Vegas is pricey especially quality food, so this place is good for the price.  For dessert, I got the Vanilla brownie creme and it was good the first few bites, but it was really sweet and rich for me. You will lose the taste for it after a couple bites, UNLESS you have a major sweet tooth.  I just couldn't hang.      I was fortunate that there was not a line here when I came.  I came here at 9pm on a Friday night, too.  This is located inside of Planet Hollywood.    They also have a other locations at Caesar Palace and Downtown Disney in Anaheim.",

There's not much I can add on top of everyone else's reviews, but trust, it's AWESOME. I love it so much that I joined a couple of friends who were making a daytrip to Vegas (from LA) just to get this sandwich! The Full Montagu is my fav. Their mustard sauce is amazing and their bread is toasted to perfection. What makes a sandwich is their bread, and Earl of Sandwich scores a 10,000,000 on a scale of 10.   So whenever you find yourself waking up in vegas (pun intended, Katy Perry), go go go!  tip: This is actually located at the intersection of Planet Hollywood and the miracle mile shops, don't wander around the hotel like I did.",

The lines here can get long, but its vegas and its a casino - rarely do you get great sandwiches in a casino.  I can easily compare this to Capriatis in vegas (which I really do love). It is my favorite sandwich joint on the strip, and its only a bonus since I play at this casino frequently.",

They have such a great system in place where you  1. order your sandwich..  2. then proceed to part of 2 of the line where you grab your sides and drinks 3. pay (5.99 for a sandwich.. awesomeness!) 4. recieve a buzzer so you can find a table and get your drinks.  In about 10-15 minutes.. your custom crafted sandwich is ready. 5. Gorge your face with the yummiest thing between two slices of bready greatness. I got to experience the full montegue and jerk chicken hot sandwiches. The sandwich fillings were not so robust.. more like they blended together so beautifully with the baked to order bread, the cheesy gooiness, and the fresh meats and  veggies.  It came perfectly gift wrapped in aluminum and had a little sticker of Earl that named each sandwich by type.. I felt like it was Christmas.. yup! Santa Earl.. So whenever Vegas is a calling.. make sure you pay Sir Earl a visit!  **If you don't wanna deal with PH's parking.. park over at Mirage and cross the street.. easy structure to get in and out of!",

The prices are super reasonable, about $6.99 for a sandwich. The soups were really good, my personal favorite was he tomato(I recommend getting the croutons on the side!)  Every time I went to earls I got lucky because we didn't have to wait in line, even though it was about 4am lol oh, they open 24/7!!!  Can't wait to go back to Vegas for more.",

I have tried the original, club, chipotle chicken avocado, holiday turkey, and full Montague. My favorites have to be the chipotle chicken, original, and full Montague... Each sandwich is $7. It used to be cheaper... but still tasty! Their sandwiches are not that big. You have to come here at least once while being in Vegas. It will definitely help you save money esp being on a budget in Vegas...  Their sandwiches are made fresh to order and toasted perfectly! Each bite is so warm and just melts in your mouth. Each ingredient in every sandwich compliments each other well. The service is fast! There is always a long line. Better yet... They're open 24/7 !! Come here when you're sober... drunk... sleepy... bored... hungry... or not hungry... you'll be craving.   I have also tried their tomato soup and chicken noodle soup ! They're both pretty decent. It's about $2.99 for a cup and $3.99 for a bowl. Soup always solves the problem in Vegas...  I haven't tried all of their sandwiches yet... but I will one day!   Earls has treated my wallet and tummy well this past week. Until then !!",

They're really famous now and have spread all the way to Disneyland in Anaheim, and several other locations.   The pricing is buck-cheap compared to the rest of the Vegas food, it is wholesome and portions are just right.   Although this location is smaller in size than the one at Disneyland, I really like how quick and convenient it is.   I suggest you try out their sandwhiches of course, like the famous hawaiian sandwhich but if you're feeling in the mood to be healthy then their wraps are amazing. I seriously didn't know cold wraps could be so flavorful and filling. I suggest the bacon chicken avo wrap, it's the perfect blend of sweet flavors with savory.",

    "text": "\"What do you guys want to eat?\" \"Let's go to Earl's!\" This is the usual convo my friends and I have whenever we are in Vegas. Recently, we stayed in Planet Hollywood for 3 days and every single meal of mine revolved around this place. No regrets!  You can't go wrong with any of their affordable signature hot sandwiches or wraps. What makes the sandwiches so amazing to me, is the bread. My favorite sandwiches are the Hawaiian BBQ (chicken, ham, pineapple, Swiss & BBQ sauce) and Chipotle Chicken Avocado (chicken, bacon, avo, cheddar, lettuce & chipotle sauce.) Since I was there for 3 days, I decided to switch up on the sandwiches and tried the wraps. The Buffalo Chicken wrap is pretty good, but my favorite is the Spicy Tuna wrap (without olives!) What makes it so delicious are the banana peppers, chipotle sauce and balsamic vinaigrette all up in there. I can never finish the whole thing, so I'm glad they always cut them in half for me to eat later. The wraps are great leftovers; the hot sandwiches aren't as good cold, but saving them for later comes in handy after coming back to the hotel hungry from a night of partying.   The line to order can be pretty long at times, but don't be intimidated because it moves quickly. After ordering, they give you a buzzer that will let you know when your order is ready. The dining area is pretty small for such a popular place, so I usually take my order to go.   They also have options for soup, salads, breakfast sandwiches and dessert: cookies, chips and brownies. I have yet to try the breakfast sandwiches, but I sure will next time. Besides the food and affordable prices, the other best thing about Earl's is that it's open 24 hours!",

Most or all sandwiches were $6.99 which is really reasonable for Vegas.  I got the Italian, and my girlfriend got the chipotle chicken so we each had half. I liked the Italian much better; the tomatoes tasted fresh and were a good addition. That said, if you're not into cured meats, the chipotle chicken was good and had a nice spice to it.   Overall, this a good one to hit for a quick, relatively small lunch and to stay on the less expensive side.",

I don't know who does the voting but they got mines.  I ordered the Original, which was pretty much a roast beef sandwich.  Warm roast beef with cheddar and horseradish sauce - pretty simple, but this sandwich gots pop!  I think what really got me was the crusty bread, which I believe is Ciabatta, but more in a hoagie style.  Again, I'm a texture guy warm soft roast beef and cheese inside a crusty bread -- you get the point.    This place always seem to have a line whether for breakfast, lunch, dinner and late night eats.  So don't be surprised just embrace since you'll know where to go eat at 4am in the morning stumbling around; \"go with the crowd and don't get lost\"!  - Enjoy!",

The prices are reasonable at 5.99-8.00 I think. Yes, more expensive than subway but 5x better.   I got the All American- turkey, cheddar, cranberries, lettuce, tomato, and ranch.

Lesson learned: as long as you are a fan of roast beef, this sandwich cannot let you down and I think this should be the first one you try if you are a first timer. Had there not been so many other things I wanted to try and eat in Vegas there would have been a second sandwich in my life. I will make sure to visit again when I am in town. Also this is a cheap meal that will leave you satisfied and its better than heading down the mall for some fast food you can get in your hometown. It's located as youre exiting PH and heading into the mall.",

They now carry the holiday turkey sub year-round and is truly the most amazing concoction I have ever tasted. The only downfall is that the subs are pretty small but the prices are inexpensive. This place is open 24 hours a day and a good place just to sit and people watch while you're eating a very tasty sandwich.",

I had the original with roast beef which was awesome and is a good place to start if you don't know what to order. I went back the next day to get the club sandwich, which was just as good. And the following morning I had half of a Hawaiian sandwich that was better than I expected it to be (oddly the cheese works well with the BBQ). When eating these sandwiches they offer their own Earl of Sandwich mustard, don't use this, go straight for that Grey Poupon!!!  Went there everyday I was in Vegas...Enough Said.",

Its located inside Planet Hollywood, or I think you can get to it eventually through the Miracle Mile shops too.  We ordered the Full Montague and the Italian. Decent sandwiches, kinda small for the price they charge you.  The Italian came with a variety of meats like salami, ham and mortadella. It was topped with tomatoes and a vinaigrette type dressing. The Full Montague had roast beef, turkey, cheese, tomatoes. The bread was really good, they were hot sammys, so it came toasted. The sammys weren't bad, they just weren't anything special. I think I am spoiled by what I can get at back at home.  Overall an ok sandwich, but I don't think I need to come back again.",

We come here late at night at times after going out clubbing. Such a great late night snack. The tomato soup is delicious, it comes with croutons.

Located in the Planet Hollywood hotel, it's a but hard to find, but worth the trip.  The bread is a pressed (panini) version of an Italian roll. It's a texture I haven't tasted before.  The Full Monague & Italian were recommended so we had to try them. Fortunately, we did not hit a long line so our food was ready in 10 minutes. The way they put together the meats and bread is tremendous. Crunchy, soft and tasty all at once!  One nice touch is they have stickers for each of their sandwich items so you don't have guess which one is which.   I'd give it 5 stars, but the sandwich isn't that big...good thing I'm not that hungry for breakfast.",

They made me an excellent caprese sandwich!  It's been a while since I went, but I remember the bread being perfectly toasted... not too soft and not crunchy where it's tearing up my gums.  It was a perfect combination of a crispy outside and warm soft fluffy bready-insides.  Then the buffalo mozzarella was so fresh, as were all the veggies that came inside my sandwich.  Most enjoyable caprese sandwich ever!  My fiance got a meatball sandwich, but he recalls it being just okay.  But after talking to so many people who rave about Earl of Sandwich, he's hyped up to go back and try a different sandwich!",

SO skimpy on the meat (which is tasteless & grocery store quality) and vegetables (1 leaf of lettuce in the sandwich). The chicken tastes microwaved and has a really squishy texture. Bread is toasted and crispy but is very thin and has NO flavor whatsoever. Caesar salad was DRENCHED in dressing and the plastic container was over half full with those nasty soggy squishy chicken pieces. Yeah you're paying ~$6 per sandwich, but I don't consider that a great deal for such a small, mediocre sandwich. SO NOT WORTH waiting in that long line. People who like Earl's - you are trippin.",

    "text": "Having eaten at Earl of Sandwich in Orlando before, my husband and I were curious why a simple sandwich place would have such a high rating on Yelp. Well, after our recent trip to Vegas, we ended up eating here 3 times because it was just so easy, tasty, and reasonably-priced by Vegas standards.   You really can't go wrong with any of their sandwiches, but try some of different sides besides chips. Their soups are delicious and are a pretty good size. I tried the tomato and Wisconsin Cheddar and both were hearty and delish. Their macaroni salad is also good and tastes homemade. The brownie creme sandwich is amaaazing (I love the one with white filling). But my favorite thing to get here is the frozen lemonade - it's tart, refreshing, and a nice break for your liver from all the drinking in Vegas.   I wouldn't say this is the best sandwich place I've ever been, but here's why I think it's so popular: for two people you can get a lot of food here for around $20...which, in Vegas, is hard to do. Even Pink's Hot Dogs was a $30+ meal for the two of us and that's just basically fast food. So if you're looking for simple, cheap(ish) eats, go here.",

Note that many things are prepackaged. The salad I had had been sitting there for quite some time (all day?) and had wilted somewhat.   I'm torn between giving this place 3 or 4 stars.

I ordered the Bacon, Egg 'N' Cheddar sandwich for breakfast and took a Chipotle Chicken Avocado for lunch during my hike.  The sandwiches were made pretty quickly.  Otherwise, this is always an option given that it's open 24 hours.  Bacon, Egg 'N' Cheddar - Pretty decent sandwich.  The bacon comes crumbled and slapped in a small mound in the middle of the sandwich.  On the outer edges of the sandwich, the bacon will fall out though, but enough remains so that you get bacon in every bite.  Overall, the sandwich wasn't anything to write home about but it's better than a fast food sandwich, but you pay for it.  Chipotle Chicken Avocado - Good chipotle sauce on the sandwich.  Normally this is eaten hot, but mine was taken as a packed lunch during my hike.  The lettuce wilted by then but the sandwich was still pretty good overall.  The chicken was still tender and juicy.  The combo of the sauce and the avocado play well together.  It's a pretty good sandwich.  Definitely more tasty than Subway which is just outside the Miracle Mile Shops area, but more pricey.  Earl of Sandwich is a pretty good sandwich place.  It's a step up from Subway and tastes like they use better quality ingredients.  It's a good option given that it's open 24/7, but it's nothing I'd go really out of my way for.  Overall, I'd recommend the shop as a place to try, but in terms of going back, I would probably only eat here if I were in the area looking for something on the relative cheap.",

There is a sports book right across from there so if you like sports you may want to try out the samiches too!!",

My lady got the Tuna Melt... man o' man, oh so good! it's so freakin simple... nuthin fancy schmancy on the tuna itself, js a lil mayo n prob salt n pepper to taste! melted cheese and toasted bread! The tuna is great, don't taste like its from a can... well I wanted to redeem my sad choice from the first visit... So I got the original! great hot beef samich with cheese and horse radish sauce! We tried 2 sides, the mac salad, n potato salad... potato was better than the mac salad.  The brownies are pretty good, moist... the best is the ice cream sandwich brownie... great!

They serve mainly Hot Sandwiches here so I think you should be eating them right away but we were in a hurry to get somewhere so we didn't have that luxury.  I may try them again at some point but the next time, I will eat it right out of the kitchen.    Their prices are cheap but their sandwiches are smaller too.  They remind me of an Americanized \"Vietnamese Sandwich Shop\"    But just so everyone knows, their prices are not Vietnamese style cheap ($3.50-$4).  They were more like ($5.50-$6.00) from what I remember.     Definitely have had better toasted sandwiches in San Francisco though....",

I will describe the sandwiches as Quizno's, but handled with care and quality ingredients. If you can tolerate Quizno's you will love the Earl.   The Earl \"is-to\" sandwiches shops (e.g. Subway, Quizno's, Togo's), what In-n-Out is to fast food burgers and what Chick-Fil-A is to fast food chicken.   I enjoyed my sandwich (the Full Montague - turkey and roast beef) while tailgating before the PBR World Cup at the Thomas and Mack center on the UNLV campus. The sandwiches are great to-go - the bread doesn't get soggy. Christina loved the Hawaiian - chicken, ham and pineapple - she would give this place 4.5-5 stars.   Also the brownies are sick. Not sick meaning sick but sick meaning  good. They are made with Ghirardelli Chocolate and REAL GOOD.   Recommended - OUT - Sixton",

It was probably a good hour or so by time they ordered it to the time they brought it back to me, but the sandwich was still warm and delicious! I can't imagine how much better it would be fresh!

Some of you may think $5.99 isn't cheap but, this isn't your cookie cutter luncheon meat $5 foot long sandwich from Subway either.  The quality and the flavor of their sandwiches is seriously awesome.  I usually order the Earl's Club which comes with Roasted Turkey, Bacon, Swiss and the fixings.  I don't like my sandwich toasted but I keep forgetting that they toast them here...grr..but it's still a good sandwich.  If you're not feeling like chips, they offer Potato, Macaroni and Pasta Salads in their cold case, for only $1.59 each.  EoS is great spot to grab a bite, especially late at night.  I need to check them out for breakfast sometime, if I can get my butt up that early...I mean, come on, this is Vegas! :)",

Meatball sandwich was delicious too, not overbearing with sauce and the meatball was flavorful! Mmm hmmm...AND I am not a fan of meatball sandwiches, they usually end up grossing me out because of the soggy bread and tasteless meatball.

    "text": "I came here after a night of dancing with my friends. We wanted a quick yet filling bite to eat, and we weren't much for pizza. My friend suggested we go to Earl of Sandwich, a respectable sandwich chain that was on our way back to our timeshare.  At 4:45AM, there was still a good number of people ordering and dining in. We were maybe third in line. The people who operate this chain would have made Henry Ford proud; their assembly line is very efficient, and the staff there work hard, even at the brink of dawn. To top it off, they were all displayed professional behavior and had a pleasant demeanor.  I ordered the infamous Earl's Club on wheat ($7.56 including tax). Our party of 4 found an open table, wiped it down, gathered our condiments and drinks, and sat down. Within 5 minutes after doing all that, our food came out promptly and accurately. The bread is very good; it was toasted but not too crunchy, and they did a good job making the wheat bread almost up to par as their original (and presumably better) bread alternative.  They didn't skimp with the filling, which I was surprised at given our location (usually touristy places aren't as good or provide less quantities in my experience). The serving portion was just right to keep everyone sated. I tried friend's soup, and it was good.   The place is a bit cold, so bring a jacket or sweater. But overall, excellent meal with excellent service.",

Me and my friends were staying at Planet Hollywood and we all came here twice, the first time when we all took a nap after our long ass drive from Riverside, and house before going back.  Its a simple fast food restaurant concept. You go in line, make your order, and they give you one of those beeper things when your order is ready.  Then you eat your sandwich at the seating area near the casino or wherever you please.  The sandwiches are pretty good, I tried 3 of them at my first visit. I had the Italian, Caribbean Jerk, and the Full Montague (i believe). The Caribbean Jerk was my favorite out of the three. What makes the sandwiches good is the toasted and warm bread. Pretty good sandwich for $6, and a good portion as well.  Also, lastly I would like to mention that the Ice Cream sandwiches they serve are really good as well. My friend and I got one when we were stumbling across the Miracle Mile Shops drunk with our friends.... it was soo good and it was huge... only for ~$3.    Definitely recommend to anyone going to Vegas, on a budget but hungry for some good food. Oh yeah 24 hours!!",

Las Vegas later opened stores at two locations Planet Hollywood and The Palms Hotel.  I usually love the taste of an \"Earl of Sandwich\" sandwich. The bread is incredibly delicious and the sandwiches are served nice and hot. BUT, not all Earls are created equally so I'm docking one star for inconsistencies in the quality of meat served.   Yesterday we tried The Original 1762 (made with beef and cheese) and it was fantastic! Unfortunately, we also tried The Earl's Club (made with Turkey and Bacon) and it stunk... the Turkey was stinky and slimy...a sign that the deli meat they are using isn't fresh.  Here are my favorite sandwiches in order:  The Italian The Original 1762 Hawaiian BBQ Chipotle Chicken Caribbean Jerk Chicken  Give one a try and see what you think. Oh, and the brownie bites are good too!",

You cannot get a better deal for breakfast.     I should have gotten my coffee here instead of Starbucks and the Coffee Bean and Tea Leaf where it costs over $4 for a cup of coffee.

There is plenty of seating available at this location and it's located in Planet  Hollywood right by the poker room and sports book and the miracle mile shops. I chose to get it to go because for some reason the hallway by the miracle mile shops always smelled really bad. But in my opinion. This is a must stop for a cheap place to eat in Vegas! You really can't go wrong with any sandwich you order.",

Every single time I have not been dissappointed. Usually if you eat something while intoxicated it tends to create a visage of what your current state is, and only to experience this awesomeness when your at that level. This sandwich however does not. Its ALWAYS good.  **Full Montegu** has my heart. I yearn for this sandwich! When I'm staying at Planet Hollywood I wake up early to buy one (24 hrs yeaaah!)  to bring on the plane ride back to LA. When i'm on the plane and open it up... In an instant, envious glares dart at me. I chuckle inside in utter joy of the magic that is about to happen :)",

On the way back to the OC, we got an assortment of sandwiches - the grilled ham and swiss, full montagu, original and the earl club.  My fav out of all 4 was the ham and swiss (although the one at Society Cafe is 100 x better!) I wasn't a huge fan of the full montagu (it tasted overly salty and the meat was kind of bland) or the other sandwiches. They definitely do not warrant the high cost of the sandwiches (close to $10 for one!) or all the hype that this place gets. I mean, the bread is better than average but the other ingredients seem run of the mill.  Meh, just meh.",

The roast beef was ok, nothing to write home about and I wish the horseradish had more of a kick to it as it was a little bland.  I actually doused my sandwich with mustard for a little more zing.  EoS definitely lives up to their \"World's greatest  hot sandwich\" motto.  Quiznos, Togos, and Subway step up yo' game, and EoS open up in the Bay Area please!!!",

I had Earl of Sandwich before in Orlando, Florida, and did not like it very much. Well, you can say that it did not strike me as \"the greatest sandwich.\" This time, however, I really thought it lived up to it's name as a great sandwich spot!  I had the Mediterranean Veggie (with feta cheese, roasted bell pepper, and sliced cucumber) . The bread was nicely toasted, but it was still soft and buttery in the inside. I thought that the profile of the sandwich was very well balanced on flavors.  Well balanced as in having a refreshing taste from the cucumber, a smoky flavor from the roasted peppers, and a salty and tart component from the feta cheese. Very well balance on my palate. I was very pleased, especially that it was under $7.00 in LAS VEGAS and on The Strip, inside Planet Hollywood.  It got really packed when I was here and it seemed like a few guests were having a difficult time looking for a place to sit and dine. The customer service was okay. The employees work really fast! Fast food at it's finest :).",

We called up our friends, and told everyone to meet us up at Earl's.  Earl's is located inside Planet Hollywood; which I thought would be a pain; however, it happened to be quite the opposite. We parked inside the parking structure and there was free valet service waiting for us. We headed inside and though it was a little bit of a maze to find the place, we eventually made it to our destination.  The line was long; as expected. But it seemed like the workers there had a pretty good system down. We ordered a turkey/bacon sandwich, and by the time we made it to the register, it was only a couple minutes before our sandwich came out.  The sandwich was super fresh, and with a little Dijon mustard, it melted in my mouth. I split half of the sandwich with my girlfriend, but I was pretty tempted to fight her for her half! It was a delicious sandwich, I would definitely go back!",

[in one day] to have a light dinner after swimming at the planet hollywood hotel.   The menu is big.. with LOTS to offer.  Things may seem ordinary, but trust me.. the bread makes all the difference.  They have a soup menu, a hot sandwich menu, wraps and salads... and of course desserts!    you order your sandwich, wrap or salad.. they give you a buzzer and a receipt... you walk down the line of neatly arranged extras of potato salads, macaroni salads... fruit cups, brownies, chips... ICE CREAM SANDWICHES!  it's pretty overwhelming ... in a good way!!  i had the full montague: Freshly Roasted Beef, Turkey, Aged Swiss & Sharp Cheddar Cheese, Lettuce, Roma Tomatoes & the Earl's Mustard Sauce...  the roast beef is fresh, the consistency is perfect.. the bread is amazing.   I also had the broccoli cheddar soup and it's seriously one of the best broc cheddar's i've ever had.  Michelle E.  also bough a cup of brownie bites that topped off my meal... i didn't even have to visit sugars after wards.  :P  this sandwich shop definitely makes the top 5 list of sandwich shops i've ever been too.. you'll be seeing me again Earl of Sandwich.. I PROMISE!",

The sandwiches here are basic sandwiches and the bread is good.  We ordered soup, which was Luke warm and bland,  and potato salad which was decent as our sides. So why didn't I like it more? I think it's because I like the sandwiches at the NY style deli in the NYNY  hotel that much more, so why wouldn't I just go there instead?",

They have so many different types of sandwiches and this place is always packed with young beautiful people in Vegas. just spend your money on alcohol, clubbing, and shows, and eat here and at other cheap places, you can satisfy ur stomach as well as not burn a hole in your wallet.

    "text": "I'm tend to be one of those people that once they try something REALLY good at a restaurant  - they  usually stick with it.     On our most recent trip to Vegas- I should have remembered that.  We had tried Earl's before and we knew that no matter what we had to make an apperance this trip and have our good friends try it.   It is BY FAR the best place I have eaten at on the strip, at a price that no one can complain about (regardless of how much $$$ Vegas sucks out of your pockets).    We absolutely LOVE Earl's Club. I usually hate mustard anything. It doesn't even taste like mustard. It is just a great blend of flavors on delicious bread. My boyfriend likes the Hawaiian too.  You may be asking.. why a 4 Star Rating? Because your experience largely depends on what sandwich you order.  I decided to be adventerous and order the Caprese.  Mozzarella Cheese, tomatoes, balsamic vingairette.  Sounds good, right?   I guess it just wasn't for me. When I opened up the foil, I thought I had picked up the wrong sandwich because the cheese was HUGE and looked like really white chicken.  I took a bite and knew that would not have appeased my ultimate craving for Earls. I stood back in line and order the Club ... and thank god I did, it was delicious!  I know some people like The Caprese, even my \"not-so-sober\" friend said it wasn't THAT bad.    The Caribbean Jerk is okay - but  I'd stick to the Club or Hawaiian from now on.",

I took a bite of hers and really liked it. The horseradish didn't over power the sandwich.  However my wife was expecting a little more bite and wished there had been more of the dressing. So just an FYI that you might want to ask for extra at least on the side. To me it was perfect. Prices were good as well. The sandwiches were $5.99 and compared to Subway or a Quiznos Earl's kills them both.",

The food definitely tasted better when I was intoxicated, especially the tomato bisque, for some reason that soup wasn't very tasty when I had a clear mind.  I thought it was too rich and acidic.  As for their sandwiches, I tried the \"full montague\" and \"hawaiian bbq\" and liked them both.  I think their bread is definitely the ingredient that makes their sandwiches so tasty.  It has that perfectly toasted crunchy exterior when you bite into the sandwich, then you get a mouthful of fresh ingredients and delicious soft bread.  I was just here two weeks ago but only ordered the tomato bisque, it definitely hit the spot at 3:00 am.  I'll be back!",

Now you may be saying to yourself, Eric, why are you eating sandwiches in Vegas? To that I say, because compared to the plethora of expensive (albeit deliciously satisfying in their own right) buffets, this sandwich achieves the same result without having to worry about overstuffing yourself. At a fraction of the cost.  (This means you can drink, gamble, or entertain yourself more however you choose)  Chipotle chicken, caprese, jerk chicken you ask? It's all good. Pair it with the tomato soup and you one tasty meal!  P.S. The line can get pretty long depending on time of day (well duh)",

It's conveniently located in Plant Hollywood with easy access to the strip and open 24/7! Everything I've tried here has been amazing. They change up the menu a lot but my go-to is definitely the Full Montague. I loved their meatball sub too but since my last visit during EDC 2015, THEY DON'T HAVE IT ANY MORE!! Thoroughly bummed. I guess I didn't get the memo about them pulling it off the menu so I just went with my regular. Overall, I really like how they toast the entire sandwich, making each bite warm and extra delicious. My orders always come out fast and if I make any modifications, the staff never seems to miss a beat. A good place to grab food on the go or to sit down before going about your Vegas shenanigans. Also very convenient if you're staying at PH for your trip. Easy, delicious, and cheap access all day. My kinda place!",

A must-stop place when you're in Vegas, Earl of Sandwiches always hits the spot for the out-of-towner, the Vegas clubber, the in-between buffet meals hungerer, the easy to-go meal poolside eater---everything you can think of.   Their hot signature sandwiches are the heart of the menu. As every parent claims they \"don't have a favorite child,\" that is how I feel about Earl of Sandwich! I swear their hot sandwiches are equally delicious. I've tried the Earl's Club, The Original 1762, The Full Montagu and the Caprese Sandwich and love them all. With every bite, the bread is warm, crunchy but soft, cheese is perfectly melted, perfect balance of meat/cheese/veggies. (If I HAD to choose, I like the Earl's Club tad bit more)   It's really all about their fresh ingredients and TLC they put in their sandwiches. All their hot sandwiches are made to order from scratch using high quality fresh ingredients and served on their own artisan baked loaf and topped with unique sauces and spreads. Their Angus beef is slow roasted in-house and freshly carved.  Everyone I bring here become instant fans of this place.  One time on a weekend trip to Vegas, I came here 4 times. Yup, it's just THAT good.",

I love The Full Montagu because of their amazing roast beef. It's tender, ultra moist, and just tasted like it was meant to exist in a perfect universe.   The Earl's Club was good, but I felt like the saltiness of the bacon was a little off with their \"Sandwich Sauce\" (which looked like thousand island salad dressing).  The Original 1762 is a jackpot sandwich of their stellar roast beef, cheese, and creamy horseradish sauce: A rich gooey orgasm.  Tuna Melt: Let's be honest, fat = flavor, and this sandwich is a saucy mayonnaise tuna-bomb.  Hawaiian BBQ is great for those who love things like Hawaiian pizza, but in sandwich form. The science behind the sweetness of the pineapple and the saltiness of the ham has never failed anyone.  The Caprese is something I personally hold dear to my heart, that combination of ingredients is what I'm all about. Sadly, I can't recall any presence of the tomato. Considering this cost the same as all the other sandwiches and has zero meat, I'd think twice about ordering it again.  Lastly, but definitely not least, the Best BLT sandwich is without any debate THE BEST BLT SANDWICH I HAVE EVER EATEN. My cousin Bryan V. has spoken of it fondly, but now I know what he's talking about. It's just a savory kingdom of bacon cooled by tomatoes and brought to life by the richness of the mayonnaise. I wish I bought several of these to go.  All sandwiches are $6 before tax. Go here. Now. Hurry.",

    "text": "OMG this place is beyond the fabulous of the stars!!! Seriously! Words cannot explain the awesome goodness that comes out of this place. Actually, I guess I should say the line speaks for itself. Don't let the line discourage you, it's actually not too bad. But the sandwiches are oh so yummy!!  Actually, the first time I had a sandwich from here, I wasn't actually there. I had just landed in Vegas and went and partied up a bit and went back to my room at the Elara. My partner was hungry and told me that they would be back. I was like what is open at this time of night. Are you gonna catch a cab? Wait, they said. No sooner had I removed my makeup and dressed into the comfy clothes, back they were with the sandwiches. It was still warm. I bit into it and was in heaven. Or as close as I could get to heaven while being in Las Vegas! At the time, I attributed the satisfaction to all day travel and some great drank. Boy, was I wrong.  Couple of days later, the partner wanted to place some bets at the sports book and asked if I wanted to grab some sandwiches to watch the game. I said sure, so I stood in line and got the sandwiches while they placed the bets. When we got settled back in the room, I took a bite of my sandwich and was so wowed! So they are as good when I'm sober AND drunk! That happens rarely, so I was just awed!!  When we finally had to leave Las Vegas for home, we grabbed some sandwiches to eat while we wait for security at the airport. So convenient that this place is in the Planet Hollywood Hotel and Casino. Makes going home a little bit more bearable. Ok, that's a lie, but the sandwiches are very tasty and easy to eat with all your luggage your lugging around.  I would like to say I've tried most of the sandwiches. And so far, every time we've stayed at the Elara <a href=\"http://www.yelp.com/biz/elara-a-hilton-grand-vacations-hotel-las-vegas#hrid:NPjBgidFouwIPjezynmpgg\">yelp.com/biz/elara-a-hil...</a> we've gotten sandwiches from here and they've all been yummers. I definitely recommend Earl of Sandwich!!",

The Original (roast beef, cheese) and The Earl (turkey, bacon, etc) are both savory and rich.  Best thing is they are open 24 hours.

    "text": "I wasn't surprised at all how good most of the food was given all the high ratings & reviews. For the price, location & style of food you get here you get more than your money's worth. I actually went back for a second round despite being full. Saved it for the trip home of coarse.   I was disappointed by the mac & cheese. It was WAYYYYY over cooked and bland. For it being lunch time you'd think it would be fresher tasting than that. They should look into \"Jus Mac\" restaurants and learn how mac and cheese should be done. Classing that dish up a bit more would help as well.   The lines are long, as to be expected for the amount of people who frequent this location. But don't worry they move fast and still produce a quality sandwich. They moved an entire bus of Japanese tourist through in under 7min. That is around 60+ people who didn't speak English well. I know because that was when I chose to get back in line for my second sandwich.  Improvement NOTE: Make your menus more available to the customers. Either on an app, paper copies that can rotate through with the customers or  additional postings while in line. This will help with tourist like me who have to read what makes up the sandwich. Even though you have that massive sign tired eyes can't focus on it.",

Could it be that most people who are writing reviews are those who have spent a late night out clubbing and got their grub on here? Well even if that is the case, my belly was very content and I'm sure the bread really helped soak up all the alcohol. In actuality, the bread seemed to be the star of the sandwich, not so much the filler inside.   In any case, I could only eat half that night and the rest ended up in my hotel fridge for morning after breakfast. It tasted delicious even then so I can only wonder how it tasted sans alcohol fresh out of the oven.  I am a big fan, and for only 6 bucks for a HUGE sandwich, anyone would be crazy not to check this place out at least once! It is on my to do list every time I am back!",

On Friday night, when we were too lazy to wait in line for Marquee we headed over to PH for some Fat Tuesdays and Earls.  At Earls we got the:   The Earl's Club - Roasted Turkey, Smoked Bacon, Aged Swiss Cheese, Lettuce, Roma Tomatoes & Sandwich Sauce  All American - Roasted Turkey, Buttermilk Ranch, Cranberries, Sharp Cheddar Cheese, Lettuce & Roma Tomatoes  Italian - Salami, Capicola, Ham, Mortadella, Zesty Italian Dressing, Mozzarella & Roma Tomato (Peppers Optional)  I also tried a bite of my friends' tuna sandwich and chicken salad - both DELICIOUS as well!   ALL THREE WERE SO SO GOOD! Well the Italian was a little salty (but go figure) and I don't really like cranberries in my sandwiches. But I ate it anyways. The bread is absolute divine. And there's enough sauce ratio that the sandwich isn't dry but it isn't soggy either.   Earl of Sandwich was so good that before we left we cabbed it to PH and got some for the road. I ordered The Earl's Club again. And I had it on Monday actually (the other half). Popped it into the microwave for 1 minute. Still as delicious as when it was freshly made.   MUST TRY IN VEGAS! And plus, it's not too expensive either.",

    "text": "As of 4/25/11, there are over 800 reviews for this place and they all say the same thing, this place is good!!!  My fiancee said that the Montague was the best sandwich she's ever had.  I won't go on to say that much, although this sandwich was up there with other sandwich greats.  Earl of Sandwich certainly gets a spot in the pantheon of great sandwiches.  Here's why:  Selection - This place has a massive selection of sandwiches.  Anyone ordering something here is bound to find one of their favorites.  From their savory Hawaiian, which includes ham and pineapple (tastes just like a Ham/Pineapple pizza on a sandwich to me) to their Jerk Chicken (for those who like it spicy), this place is sure to please.  They also offer a plethora of desserts.  Service - The service is friendly for the most part.  We went to this location twice during our visit to Vegas.  The first time was better than the second.  During our second visit, the cashier decided to have a \"fuck my life\" moment and didn't really acknowledge us.  Other than that, the service is good, I'll take the second experience as a rare occurrence.  Bread - This place isn't like other sandwich shops in the regard that you only get one type of bread, GOOD BREAD!!!  For what they restrict in selection in the bread department, they make up for by making the bread they have excellent.  I liken this bread to a brick, only because it is formed like one.  In fact, when you get the sandwich in it's distinctive wrapping, it looks exactly like a gold brick.   Don't worry the bread isn't hard like one, it's soft and buttery, yet has some crispiness to it.    Some sandwich shops gain their notoriety by having the \"biggest sandwich\" around or the \"messiest sandwich around\", Earl of Sandwich does neither.  The sandwich itself is actually smaller than what you'd expect, but the taste more than makes up for this.  Do yourself a huge favor the next time you're in Vegas, hit up Earl of Sandwich!",

The last thing you want to be doing in that state is figure out where to eat; because inevitably, you'll end up paying $20 bucks for a crappy sandwich.  So save yourself the disappointment of overspending on awful food; keep this place in the back of your mind.  At ~$6 for delicious sandwich, you won't be let down.  The Italian has all the deliciousness you would expect with salami, capicola, cooked ham, Italian dressing, and cheese.  The big surprise for me was the All American: Roasted turkey, buttermilk ranch, cranberries,cheddar, lettuce, and tomatoes.    I thought to myself, \"Cranberries?  Really?\"    Oh yes, really.   They push the sandwich over the edge of mediocrity and into the realm of hunger satisfying deliciousness.  Open 24/7, you'll never have an excuse again to pay for crappy food in Vegas.",

    "text": "I really enjoy Earl of Sandwich.  First and foremost, I love that their soups are only $2.99. I am a huge fan of tomato soups and they have a very good tomato soup with croutons. EoS is generally a rather affordable food compared to nearly everything else on the strip.  Strangely enough, Kalila and I both wanted soup today. We went to Earl of Sandwich for some Broccoli Cheddar. It was a VERY HEAVY soup. It was good and tasty. I would have liked some more broccoli chunks though.  I had a full montague and it was delicious. I really liked the roast beef and the mustard.  Kalila had the canonballs and it was also delicious. The sauce seemed to be all over the sandwich wrapper instead of the meatballs, though. Overall, it was kind of dry.   We like that the bread is toasted, but after reading Misti's review, she makes a great point about how there are no other bread choices.  Based off of the other times Kalila has eaten there: She highly recommends getting a tuna melt sandwich and a tomato soup. Eating them together is reaaaaaallly good!  OH, AND! You can order a Grey Lemonade. It's Grey Iced tea and lemonade. Basically, an arnold palmer with a different type of iced tea. Whether or not you like it, depends on your taste buds. I know people who love it and people who can just tolerate it. It is something that they fill your cup behind a wall, but refills are free if you ask at the pick up area. Just try it to see if you like it or not.  #foodcrew",

I'm not just throwing that superlative out there haphazardly. The sandwiches here are the best! Period.  Why? The meats are roasted fresh on location every morning. The bread is baked baked before your eyes fresh for your sandwich as soon as you place your order.  The bread.   Oh man...what kind of narcotics are they lacing that toasty loaf with? It is soo bloody good!  To top it all off, it's only $6.  It's the best $6 you'll spend in Vegas...Guaranteed!  I highly recommend you try \"The Original\".  It simply features Roast beef + Cheddar + Horse Radish served on their crazy good bread. The minimal amount of ingredients allow you to taste how truly flavorful each individual one is.",

However, in comes Earl...  $5.99 for all of their sandwiches. $2.99 for their soups. Open 24 hrs/day.  Sandwich is freshly made, perfectly toasted, and nice and hot when you get it. It's definitely worth the long waits during lunch rush. I like how you can watch all of the employees making the sandwiches as you wait in line. I tried the Earl's Club last time, and loved it. The Original was good, too, but I wish there veggies in the sandwich as well.   Chicken noodle soup is a nice snack, but it's a very small bowl. It makes a nice complement to the sandwich, but sandwich is first priority here. Top dog.  YOU MUST COME HERE.",

For those who have never been to an earl of sandwich, it's an unassuming sandwich place that kicks some serious ass! You walk up, place your order, pay and then when your order is up they call your number. You sit in a room that looks like a library or a study with fake books on the wall. What's not to like about that? It's also great if you want a quick bite to take to go and eat in your room. I've tried a number of their sandwiches and I'm a fan of their soup. That's a big statement for me to make because I don't like sandwiches in general, but I'll kill an Earl of Sandwich sandwiches anytime. The sandwiches cost between $5-6 and the soup $1.95.  Nowadays there aren't many places in Vegas where you can grab a quick/cheap meal that actually tastes good.",

Little did I know that it was just another Subway style sandwich place--with darker interior and more sit-down areas.  Don't get me wrong though their sandwiches were super well made, actually no they were super well done with the warming up process.  I really want to try the sandwich non-warmed up to see if there is a difference with the taste and texture.    I ordered The Earl and the Hawaii BBQ Chicken which I both highly recommend.  Other people went more extravagant with their choices, such as the Full Montagu but I personally wanted to see if their basic sandwiches were even stellar.    The location of Earl of Sandwich is incredibly convenient and I couldn't have asked for a better location.  Smack middle-ish on the Strip and very near the entrance of Planet Hollywood. The fact that it's opened 24 hours a day makes this place even more golden.",

My favorite sandwich has to be the currently limited edition Chipotle Chicken Avocado. I think a large part of this is due to my recent obsession with avocados...but this sandwich is waaaaay too good to pass up! It is perfection in sandwich form. I hope it becomes a permanent staple in their menu! If you're not feeling too hungry at the time, definitely save half a sandwich for a 4am snack and I can assure you it will taste just as amazing then.   A huge plus is also the price. For under $7 dollars, you will have a very happy tummy, ready to party the night away in Sin City. Plus 1 more point due to the fact that this place is open 24/7. You can fulfill your cravings at any time!!! It doesn't get any better. I'm so excited that they are gonna open one in Downtown Disney because I won't have to travel to another state just to have some of this goodness! But that won't stop me from paying more visits to Vegas though ;)",

Next time I found myself at the PH, I made a point to try it.  I ordered The Original 1762, which is a roast beef sandwich with horseradish sauce.  It was just as good as people have been saying.  Just a tasty sandwich on delicious bread for a great price, especially as we were on the strip.

Take it from me, a girl who doesn't give a sh*t about sandwiches or burgers (they are good don't get me wrong but I could care less for them) Earl of Sandwich has really turned my world upside down and inside out with their hot sandwiches.  We had seconds, thirds, and ordered some to go...that's how amazing they were. Caribbean Jerk Chicken and the All American. Go for it! You won't be disappointed, in fact you'll wonder why you lived your life without ever knowing such good food could exist.  I will truly die from happiness if SOMEHOW an Earl of Sandwich were to open somewhere in Northern California... preferably SF...AHEM hahaha but anyway, I vow to always come here every trip I make to Vegas...for the rest of my life.

I had the earl's club, which was allright, and the chipotle chicken advocado, which was dope! I think their greatest strength is they toast the sandwich the perfect amount, heating the insides almost like a panini.  I was also incredibly impressed by the efficiency of their line, which got us in and out during peak times. Nothing revolutionary, but for $6.99/sandwich, it's a great deal among the options of Las Vegas, which seem to be either food poisoning or $25 for a burger",

If you're anywhere near this part of the strip, staying at either the Cosmo, Bellagio, PH towers/Elara, or clubbing at Marquee, you're more than likely going to end up here at some part of the day.  Very solid hot sandwiches, everything from the toppings to sauce is well balanced within and for $6 its quite the steal in Vegas. With their toasted bread, each bite is paired with a savory crunch along with their simple sauces, making it hard not to fall in love with what you're eating. I personally get the Full Montague when I swing by the first time since another future sandwich is inevitable. Stand out sandwiches include the original and club, and if you're feeling adventurous go with the Caribbean jerk sandwich. Only item I'd skip is the meatball/Cannonball sandwich, its pretty standard and nothing to write home about.  Lines can be pretty long but the it moves fast and there's plenty of seating, making this 24/7 spot a great place to grab a bite as you're shuffling your sore feet back to your room.",

    "text": "At 4 a.m., as I ate my Caprese sandwich, I was feeling very \"threesie\" (as in stars) about this place. Several of tables were dirty. An employee on break was clearly not happy that we were sitting near her in the quieter section and not amongst the bright, teetering post-club groups around the corner. The seat cushions were ripped. Bleh.  Oh, and I'd ordered the Wisconsin Cheese soup without thinking to ask if it was vegetarian (my fault - I should know better with soups), so I was grumpy to open the lid and see all of the little clumps of bacon. (And grumpy because, again, this was my fault, so I didn't feel like I could take it back.) I tried to get my husband to eat it, but he pushed it away after a bite and a half. \"It tastes like Velveeta with bacon bits.\" (Now that's the restaurant's fault.)  I found myself wishing that we'd gone to Krung Thai or Peppermill, where their Caprese sandwich leaves me nuzzling my hands for an hour afterward. Mmmmm. Fresh, fresh basil!  And what the heck was this frozen lemonade with the too-small straw that tasted like oversweet mixer with a dash of water?  I looked at the brown-edged, withering flower in the vase on the table and thought, \"The sandwich is good, but I can't go higher than a three. This bread is really chewy and delicious, and it's nice to have a hot Caprese. It's also nice that they have more than one vegetarian sandwich. Maybe a three-and-a-half.\"  The next day I found myself wishing for another hot Caprese. Okay, four stars it is. I had to remember to compare this with Subway and Quiznos, not with other late-night options. Four stars for a menu with two hot vegetarian sandwiches on distinctive bread, for pagers that mean you can find a place to sit and relax and wait for your order to be ready, for friendly staff (at least those on-duty), and for being open 24 hours.  Minus a star for dirty tables, for lazy frozen lemonade, for soup that tastes like processed cheese, for a cake-like chocolate-chip cookie of minimal flavour that would be overpriced at half the price, and for charging $6 for a 6\" meatless sandwich that, once you get past the bread, is nothing special.  I'm still craving a sandwich on nice bread, though... which is why it's going to be Schlotzsky's for lunch tomorrow. But the next time I'm at Planet Hollywood and hungry, but not \"sit-down hungry,\" I'll happily get a Caprese to go.",

I was expecting regular sandwiches, and in one of the previous reviews that I have read, these sandwiches were actually compared to Capriotti's!  WHEN: It is open 24 hours so you have no excuse to not get up and try it!!  WHERE: Located inside the Miracle Mile Shops in Planet Hollywood, right across from the Sugar Factory.  WHAT: Knowing this, I took my first bite into The Earl Club, and the first bite was all I needed to know that this was truly going to be one of my favorite sandwich joints. It hit the spot right away, haha! The flavors all intermingled inside of  artesian bread created a PARTY IN MY MOUTH!   I couldn't get enough, so I came back the next day excited to try another sandwich! This time I tried the Tuna Melt. OMG, I felt like I tasted PARADISE! This is the best tuna melt I have ever tasted!! Beautifulness! Its simplicity was all that was needed to be the best on my list!  Besides the sandwiches, I liked the Iced Tea Lemonade! It is something different, but different is good sometimes! =D  My newfound goal is to try all of the sandwiches here!! LOL Another thing, incomparable to Capriotti's for sure SON!  WHY: IF YOU HAVE NOT TRIED THE SANDWICHES HERE YET, YOU NEED TO TRY IT FOR YOURSELF INSTEAD OF READING MY FLUFFED UP REVIEW. LOL, THE FLUFF WAS SO NECESSARY!! ENJOY. =)",

So I went up to ask for our order and even told them when the order was placed...and then the  manager came and took my receipt to check on out order. As soon as I saw the manager walking back and forth and yelling out our number to see where's our sandwiches I knew they didn't have our order! While I was getting more frustrated I realized there's two more ladies around was also frustrated with the similar issue!! Earl of Sandwich, you might want to improve or upgrade your system so the orders wouldn't go missing and make your customers wait forever while expecting their order is going to come out soon.   1 star for our first visit disappointment and will not visit again since there are other places to try too.",

Being a vegetarian I stuck to their two choices of caprese and veggie. The sandwiches were extremely fresh tasting and yummy and warm. The bread went really well with the toppings. The price ($6) was also a big plus in expensive vegas but I'd eat there even if they charged a bit more.  The sandwiches were pretty big and we would share 2 sandwiches between 3 of us. Tried there double chocolate muffin too which was simply scrumptious (comparable to the cupcake I ate at Sugar factory).  I just wish I had an Earl's in the bay area too:(",

I found the sandwich to be a good sandwich, but not the best I have had, especially for the price point (although this was in Vegas, so maybe prices in other locations differ).  The main thing setting this place apart from other sandwiches that I have had was the bread that the sandwich was on.  The bread was very tasty and that was what really made the sandwich.  It had a nice light buttery taste to it which really gave flavor to the whole sandwich.  Overall, I thought this was a good solid sandwich which I would order again, but do not see the hype or have the same love for it others seem to.",

    "text": "I had a few hours to kill on the Strip recently and I was famished, so I decided to finally try the Earl of Sandwich to see if it lived up to the massive amount of hype it gets from tourists. First impression: Ugh. There was a long line, a couple of the employees looked pretty frazzled and many of the table were littered with trash.   I ended up ordering 'The Best BLT'. A little cocky, are we Earl? I love BLTs and I love BLTAs even more, so I had them add avocado for a $1 upcharge. Then I waited another 10 minutes after I ordered to pay another employee $10 and change for the sandwich and drink. After paying I was given one of the buzzers many places use to let people know their tables are ready.  Thankfully the wait for my actual food was pretty short, I had just grabbed some napkins and filled my drink.   My sandwich was good but mindblowing? No. Not even close. The bacon was well cooked, nothing ruins a BLT quicker then soggy bacon.. but I have had more flavorful bacon elsewhere. The bread was tasty but greasy, causing me to require a ton of napkins. The avocado really made it as good as it was, but I get the credit for that, not Earl.   Many people call The Earl of Sandwich inexpensive, I guess for the Strip it isn't insane, but I am pretty sure that for just a few dollars more I could have found a place on the Strip where I could get a BLTA with waiter service.  If you are stumbling around Planet Hollywood all wasty-pants, these sandwiches would probably blow you away. If you are sober, or a local (or both) chances are you won't be THAT impressed by these. Worth a visit if you are in the area but not worth a special trip to the Strip in my opinion.",

    "text": "Eating sandwiches in Las Vegas?  This wasn't exactly where I saw myself eating with all the choices on The Strip.  When it came down to a decision, I couldn't refuse the loudly reviewed sandwich shop which now advertises that they OPEN 24 HOURS outside.    *Chicken tortilla soup - Bun and I almost always get a soup and share.  Through experience of sandwich shop soups, the soups usually are menu fillers.  Due to the constant reheating, flavor and freshness disappear over time.  Ranking them atop many franchise soups, the chicken tortilla soup wasn't too shabby.        *Cannonballs! - Yeah, \"Cannonballs!\" is the name of the sandwich.  Also don't forget that exclamation point when ordering.  Like a good o' cannonball to the face, nothing surprising here, inside they have marina, cheese, and hunky balls of meat.  Boy does my Bun love her meatball sandwiches.  Even at Subway, when in doubt, her choice would be a meatball sandwich.  Chowing down the sandwich, I wrestled it away from her for a bite.  That singular bite almost led to a second.  That is until Bun put a sleeper hold on me and yanked the sandwich out of my hand.    *Earl's Club - What's the difference between Earl's Club and a turkey club?  Not much besides the name.  Turkey, bacon, lettuce, and tomato were what I tasted before gulping it down.  Do I have any comments on the sandwich?  \"Good\".  My mouth is still full.  Don't bother me.          All sandwiches are about six inches and deceivingly filling.  In view of the fact their label of a franchise, nearly all ingredients tasted very fresh.  Their most underrated attribute are the artisan bread used for buns.    For about the same price, why would anyone on Earth pay for a Subway sandwich?  Budget friendly and open all the time, Earl of Sandwich is a wise choice for the haggard Strip journeyers.  In need for food and a place to rest their feet, Earl of Sandwich is a very useful alternative on The Strip.",

My body screamed for chicken noodle soup and nothing else would do. We wandered the strip going up to numerous restaurants asking what their soup of the day was. Whhhhy was nobody's soup of the day chicken noodle soup when I desperately needed it to be so.  I think a can of Campbell's chicken noodle soup  should be an essential part of my Vegas luggage.  I forgot how to control myself and couldn't say no to free drinks from cute n not so cute guys. Washington Apples and Patron Shots sure. How many rounds was that? That's what happens on your first night in Vegas u make a noob move and go all out on night one.  On day two u are a burden to your friends as they are trying to help u recover from the previous nights antics.   My savior!!! Earl of Sandwich. I know you're yelpfamous(yea I just made that up)  for your sandwiches but I am ohhh so grateful for your chicken noodle soup. It was exactly what I needed and was the cure to what ailed me.",

It's not that the sandwich has a bad taste. It does not. But the bread, even though they are trying to make it more artisan, just misses the mark. I found it to be a bit on the hard side. That just ruins a sandwich for me.  The Earl of Sandwich is located in the Palms, so there is no ambiance at all. Step in, get your sandwich, and then find a table to sit at while everyone else at the other seven restaurants is doing the same. I also thought the price was quite high for something just on the lower side of OK.",

    "text": "Wow. 4.5 stars out of 1000+ reviews?? That's a lot to live up to, Earl.  My buddy and I arrived to PH and walked around trying to find Earl of Sandwich for a few minutes. We found it by it's line. Yeah, this joint is both a tourist hot spot and local locale. Straight bumpin'.  The menu is huge. I took a sneak peak, and I suggest you do the same if you're popping your Earl cherry, at the sandwiches that are offered at EoS. They've got more than sammies, but nothing appealed to me [lettuce isn't my cup of tea].  I wound up ordering two sandwiches, one for the lady and one for myself. We got the tuna and the Full Montagu [not to be confused with the foes of the Capulets]. The lady friend said, and I quote, \"this is the best tuna sandwich that I've ever had.\" So I guess it's aight. As for the Full Montagu? Shawty rockin' to the beat for ya boyyyy. Geez, Louise. Folks talk about the roast beef...and there is good reason. It makes this, and probably any, sandwich.  Service is fast and fun; the guy who took our order gave me a nice \"Thank you. Come again\" at the end of our transaction. I looked at him with a \"are you serious\" look and we both laughed. The crew takes their time creating these sammies, so be patient. I mean, what's five minutes? Just stand off to the side with your order-pager and watch some television. They've got plenty of flat screens all over the place.  Definitely a solid four, but it comes very close to the four-and-a-halfsies that is attached to Earl's name.",

    "text": "There are literally thousands of reviews extolling Earl of Sandwich as the finest (and most affordable!) place to have a sandwich on the Strip.  While all those reviews are indeed awesome, I'm going to talk about something else entirely: tomato soup.  Yes, tomato soup.  (I've said it before and I'll say it again... The easiest way to make a snap judgement about a restaurant is by looking at the quality of its soup.)  The tomato soup at Earl's is orgasmic.  In fact, it's the best damn tomato soup I've ever had.  It's rich, it's creamy, and it's packed with an incredible depth of tomato flavor.  It's topped with the most perfectly crisped croutons I've ever encountered (not too soft, not too hard).  One spoonful of this tomato soup and I was in foodie heaven ...  ... at 8:30am.  Yeah, I went to Earl's for breakfast.  Weird, I know -- but please don't hate.  It's actually a great place to go for breakfast.  There are no lines in the morning, and there's plenty of seating to go around.  In fact, it was only like 5 minutes between when I placed my order at the counter and when the little electronic plastic thingy started blinking and vibrating to let me know my food was ready.  What to have with tomato soup at 8:30am?  Grilled cheese wasn't on the menu, so I had the next-best thing: the tuna melt.  And, oh my God, this tuna melt was just as orgasmic as the tomato soup.  It was a fresh, delicious roll with piping hot tuna and a layer of beautifully melted cheese.  Is there such thing as tuna bliss?  I think there is, and it's served up at Earl's.  Did I mention that all this food cost less than 10 bucks?  Have I convinced you of Earl's amazingness yet?  If so, get off your butt and walk -- no, RUN -- to the Planet Hollywood hotel as fast as you possibly can and start noshing on some of the best cheap eats in Las Vegas.",

The price is alright. When I first had it, it was really tasty, the taste of fresh warm toasted bread with a ingredients I enjoyed was perfect. so I wanted to pick up another the next day to save and eat on my drive back home. To my disappointment the sandwich had lost what made it tasted so great when it was eaten cold. The bread became hard to eat.

The Club Sandwich was very tasty. On the other hand I enjoyed the Meatball sandwich more because it was crunchy and very delicious. Too bad I can only eat at Earl's when Im in Vegas. =\\ I will definitely return to enjoy another sandwich!",

My favourites were the chicken chipotle and the full montagu.  For the price and taste, not bad.    These things don't travel well though.

EoS is the perfect compromise between price, convenience, and quality.   Their sandwiches are so damn good. My favorite is the Hawaiian BBQ. The fresh toasted bread might be the best part, but everything is quality. Get full and enjoy it for under ten dollars? Way better than stooping at panda or sabaro.   If you're looking at EoS as an option for eating right now, I strongly encourage you to go. You probably will not need to take my work though. See all these reviews and ratings? Its good! Its cheap! I promise, you'll enjoy it.",

Really really flavorful and juicy especially with the pineapples. These sandwiches were so good, that I bought TWO within one sitting. After I finished the first sandwich I went back in line and bought the Holiday Stuffed Turkey Sandwich. It was like an entire Thanksgiving dinner inside the buns. Dried turkey?? NOPE. It fused together perfectly with the cranberry paste and gravy. SO GOOD.  Will come back here if I was back in Vegas for SURE.   24/7 for all the drunkards out there as well. PERFECT. Can't get any better than this.",

And good luck to whoever is gonna try to take that title away next year. The Earl of Sandwich makes the perfect size, perfect taste, perfect crunch, perfect bread, perfectly warm sammich on the Las Vegas strip. Hands down... I really shouldn't write anymore than that. I postponed writing a review for this place for over a year. I thought it'd be best kept between my friends & I, along with the lucky people who have stayed at PH or the ones that have shopped at the Miracle Mile Shops.  My favorite sammich here is the Italian... I am not worthy. It's so damn good. It has salami, capicola, mortadella, ham, tomatoes, mozarella cheese and italian dressing. It's so good. You will know when you first bite into it. Trust me.  The Best BLT is good too. I don't like it as much as the italian but its way better than your everyday BLT. Bacon, roma tomatoes, lettuce and tasty mayo.  The Earl's Club is very good. Perfect marriage of bacon, turkey, swiss cheese, lettuce, tomatoes & a sauce that is indescribably good.  Earl's is good for lunch, dinner, after-club snack or it's 4am and there's nothing better to eat at the casino than this sandwich type of meal. It's the perfect sammich. It's just the right amount to make you want another one but somehow one is just right. I cant explain it. It hits the spot.   The sugar cookie is very good. And the ice cream sandwich that puts vanilla ice cream in-between two brownie patties is genius.  EARL of SAMMICH... No Vegas trip is complete.",

It turned out delicious!! It was a interesting combination, a little sweet and a little salty. We also got a club sandwich, a salad, the chili and the loaded potato soup. Both the chili and loaded potato soup was bomb!! I heard really good things about the cheddar broccoli soup, so I'm definitely going to have to go back and try it before I leave! The club sandwich was just okay, but pretty full sandwich. Lots of bacon and avocado. Although the line can be long, it moves really quickly and the food comes relatively quickly as well.

Some people like drunchies to be unplanned, but my trip to Earl of Sandwich was definitely planned days before. The line was relatively long, probably took over 20 minutes from standing in line to sitting down and devouring my sandwich but the wait was so worth it!  I got three different sandwiches: the chipotle chicken avocado, the tuna melt and the hawaiian bbq! YES - a small girl like me had to have three, but of course I didn't eat them all in one sitting. Honestly, if my boyfriend didn't stop me, I would have gotten a dozen of these sandwiches to-go. They were simply too good and I can't even tell you which one is my favorite because all three were amazing!!!   There are plenty of seating but as you can imagine, the lines are long and there are always a lot of people so seating may be hard to find. I didn't have trouble finding a seat for two, but that was at 3pm, which is more of a lunner hour instead of normal eating hours.   TRUST ME. GO HERE. IT IS BOMB!!  I think I'm gonna have to head to downtown disney this week just to get some of these sandwiches.",

I have spoken highly of your restaurant to them as I had visited various locations including the one in Las Vegas at least twice. However to my misfortune this time the experience was DREADFUL. Out of 5 people I was the second person to order, my order consisted of a Caprese which after my whole party was done eating was handed to me damn COLD and quite UN_TASTEFUL. To my surprise, upon me approaching one of the employees to complain about the sandwich, he simply disregarded my comment and continued shuffling bags. I had to call to his attention twice before they acknowledge my presence, after they had heard my comment I was told that they did not give me my sandwich earlier because the \"buzzers\" were not working properly and I was excused. I, unhappy with the experience wanted to continue to voice my un-satisfaction with the service, such for which I was ignored. However the cashier did proceed to ask the employee if anything was wrong. I approached the cashier and tell her that the sandwich was extremely late and was also cold, comment she acknowledges which such disdain, I FELT EMBARRASSED to have mentioned it in front of the other customers. This was an absolutely terrible and embarrassing experience, I do not come to an establishment to be brushed-off or neglected as just another \"assumed\" drunk customer, much the less be PATRONIZED and ignored when trying to voice a complaint about the food or services provided. This was an incredibly terrible experience which left me a quite sour taste for this company which I had really enjoyed in the past.",

The convenience and affordable prices are just superb pluses to the food. Oh yeah they're open 24/7 and usually gets your orders really fast even when lines are long.

    "text": "Soup - 5 stars (woo-hoo!) Salad - 4 stars (yay!) Sammnich - 3 stars (ok...)  Located in planet hollywood, just on the outskirts of the miracle mile shop, this place was poppin!  I mean, at a couple separate times, the line wrapped around the eatery.  However, the line does move quickly, but not quick enough for me to lose $10 on the Batman: Dark Knight  slots machines (crap!).  The first day, I was too hung over to eat anything filling so I opted for the cobb salad.  A decent portion size, all of the ingredients tasted fresh.  Although the chicken was moist and lightly seasoned, I kinda wished there was less chicken and more lettuce.  There was enough for me to bring a bit back to the hotel room and snack on it later...  The next day, I was in search for more food, specifically soup, and found my way back to Earl.  I saw a picture of the holiday sandwich while waiting in line and thought, \"Hey, I like turkey, gravy, and stuffing, why not?\"  I ordered the holiday sandwich and broccoli and cheddar soup to satisfy my inner fat kid.  Ah, soup...  I'm a soup junkie.  When my boyfriend is sick, I think of chicken noodle soup and end up eating it all myself.  The soup at Earl's was very tasty.  The soup was nice and thick with lots of melted cheddar and the broccoli was nice and soft and melt in your mouth style.  The only downside was the portion size is too small, but what do you expect for $2.99?  Now the sandwich...  I don't know, maybe I had higher expectations of thanksgiving dinner to go, but I was thoroughly disappointed.  1. they forgot my cranberries, 2. definitely not enough gravy, no no cranberries and small amount of gravy equals dry sammnich , and 3. the meat was uber salty!  As you can see, everything led to a dry, salty sandwich which did not go so well for someone who is already dehydrated from binge drinking the night before.  I managed to get half the sandwich down and all the soup, but it proved futile when I literally vomited to food back up in the hotel room, literally 15 minutes later.  (yayy cause there goes all the calories I just ingested, and no I don't have an eating disorder).  That being said, I still ate the other half of the sandwich the next morning :)  I'm pretty sure I'll still go back on future",

The only reason i have ever tried this place was because i stayed at the planet hollywood and i came back from a night of partying and was sooooo hungry. Thank god this place was open 24 / 7 YO! So i decided to get a earls club which is a turkey bacon sandwich. It looked like a normal sandwich as i watched them prepair it. The place made the sandwich fast and was wrapped in a a nice foil that actually kept the sandwich warm for quite some time. I  also want to mention alot of the people getting sandwichs here at night are people they came back from partying and drinking alot.  Anyways i got my earls club brought it back to my room and just wanted something with bread in it to soak in the alcohol. First bite i toook of my EARL'S club and i was FEELING it! it WAS SOOO GOOOD! The bread had a nice crisp to it, it wasn't to crisp because u can feel the softness of it too. PLus the turkey and bacon made it really good. Most of the sandwichs at earl's i believe and HOT sandwichs. I just got a sandwich and it was only 5-7 dollars. For a late night snack this really hit the spot. I was thinking of getting another one before i went to bed but decided to just wait until i wake up to get another one! Hahaha Sooo now everytime i stay at planet hollywood, i have to earl's sandwich. I think the way they make their sandwichs plus the way they prepare and toast the sandwich is kind of unique. Their bread / sandwich's does have a distinct taste to it. Please try this sandwich place if your staying at planet hollywood. The line is long during the day and during the night it goes by pretty fast.",

Which isn't very cool because some people are annoying and obnoxious when they are drunk. Mother day weekend I was there and there in front of me was a skin headed Armenian hocking up and spitting on the floor. It was disgusting.  Once you get passed the long line to the register I normally order 6 sandwiches because I go to Vegas twice a year and the line is long so I have to make it worth my while and share it with the family.  Their sandwiches are good. I don't think you can go wrong with any of them as long as you eat them as soon as you can because the bread gets hard and chewy.

    "text": "My favorite part about Vegas (and it's also a fav for all my friends too) is going to this amazing sandwich joint at the Miracle Mile Mall. It's quite possibly the best thing to eat after a night of shitfaced hammerisms and/or clubbing. Nothing greasy and heavy, just pure sandwich heaven. What tops it off is that it comes wrapped in gold and so it looks like a gold bullion because of the sandwich's brick shape. And of course it should because that hunk of whichery is effing golden!   I always get the Carribean Jerk Chicken and it never fails me. The bread is this rectangular cut, well toasted sponge bread. I detected some little bell peppers and a tinge of spice in the sauce which satisfied the buds. I also had Broccoli Cheddar soup and it was a bit thin but I could tell they threw some black pepper in there to make things a bit more exciting.   The only complaints I have are A) They need to start making more shit! and B) It is a bit expensive (you'll walk away spending $12 for a sammich, soup and drink). Other than that, it's absolute perfection!  Oh one last complaint, there's only three locations and only the Vegas location is supposed to cater to everybody on the West Coast. Eff you Earl. Eff you for your greediness by hoarding your gold bars of delicious sandwiches.",

But honestly, esp coming here late at night.. the sandwiches are delish. And no it's not the \"drunchies\" that's making me say this because I've eaten at Earls during the day as well. Their sandwich portions aren't that big though so you can defs finish a whole sandwich on your own if you're super hungry. Other than that, the prices are okay too. Only thing is.. lines might be kind of long since this place is super popular (could also be hard to find a seat).   The sandwiches are perfectly toasted, with just the right amount of everything. Oh, and you can't forget the Grey Poupon (sp?)! But yeee this place is a must go for a good, affordable meal in Vegas!",

    "text": "My favorite little sandwich place! And I always try to make a stop there while in Vegas. Its delicious and cheap!  My favorites: The Veggie Sandwich The Caprese Sandwich or wrap  Although the caprese is one of my favorites, they need to add some sort of spinach or mixed green lettuce to this. If not, you have a greasy delicious meal of buttered bread with cheese, tomato, basil and sprinkles of balsamic vinegar. The balsamic vinegar is out of this world good and the bread is amazing. But I can't help but feel like I will start breaking out or that my arteries are clogging after eating this. Add some spinach!! On the other hand, I suppose thats the type of meal someone is looking for when drunk or hung over in Vegas. Maybe I shouldn't eat there sober.  The service is to be expected being a place where you place your order, find your own seat and grab your food when your buzzer goes off. Nothing special but the food will be a burst of rainbows, love and joy in your mouth. Eat on!",

I think what really makes the sandwich stand out is the toasted artisan bread. I wonder if you can buy the bread by itself. The meat combination makes it even better.

I got the Chipotle Chicken Avocado with a Broccoli & Cheddar soup. The chicken was grilled to perfection with a perfect balance of chipotle sauce topped with fresh avocados. For those of you that are a big fan of avocados, the Earl Club is something to rave about. It's a classic sub with turkey and your sandwich essentials (tomatoes, lettuce, Swiss). The soup was alright, it was a little early to get a better feel for it but it was good.",

We shared: The Full Montagu - roast beef, turkey, two cheeses (aged swiss and sharp cheddar), lettuce, tomato, and house mustard The Italian - salami, capicola, roasted ham, mortadella, and zesty italian dressing Mediterranean Chicken Salad - super fresh, and the chicken was really tender!    I can't even tell you which sandwich I liked better because they were both good in their own right.    They're open 24 hours so eat here for dinner, go gamble, then come back and eat some more.

I'm definitely not a sandwich person and don't go out go out of my way to get one, but every time I'm in Vegas, I make a stop by this place(even though there's one in downtown disney).   Pros: HUGE VARIETY OF SANDWICHES  Yummy soup & salad options Reasonable prices Line can be long, but it moves fast Located close to Fat Tuesdays (;  Cons: Lines are long almost at every time in the day(I can get impatient) I wish portions were a TAD larger(maybe I'm a fatty) Needs more seating for amount of people that come here  I've tried a variety of their sandwiches and my favorite are the Chipotle Chicken Avocado and the Tuna Melt. They are so mouth watering, I can't wait to go back to vegas to eat here again! I also love their seasonal Thanksgiving leftover sandwich(turkey, cranberry sauce, gravy, stuffing, the works) and limited edition Philly cheesesteak! Def. try their limited/seasonal sandwiches when you get the chance! Their cheddar and broccoli soup is also delicious!

The sandwich place is located in the Miracle Mile Mall inside the Planet Hollywood Hotel and Casino. And this is one of the hottest businesses in Las Vegas.   At 9:30pm, there was still a line with maybe fifteen people ahead of me. With so many places for a quick bite, I wasn't expecting a line; even at that time.    Finally my turn and from the menu, I chose the Caribbean Jerk Chicken. Most sandwiches (excluding the extra topping) are $5.99. My sandwich comprises with a grilled chicken breast, sweet peppers, melted cheese and a spicy Caribbean sauce in a toasted roll. <a href=\"http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/DkYS3arLOhA8si5uUEmHOw?select=282xQYVko0N2D1VFHFB4qA\">yelp.com/biz_photos/DkYS...</a>  Sorry, I didn't find this sandwich or this chained franchise too impressive. But I would definitely choose this over Subway or Quizno's. The sandwich is good enough, but nothing too stunning.   Maybe I'm spoiled because I live in the Bay Area and get better gourmet sandwiches such as Ike's place, Genova's or Roxie's. For a franchise, it's ok.   If I have time to come back for a quick bite, I might try the Yogurt Parfait and pastries.

Random musings aside, I have to say that I must be missing whatever the hype is about this place. I visited this place three times while staying at Planet Hollywood, once for breakfast, once for lunch, and once at (ahem) maybe around 2am. At no time, sober or un-sober, was I really in any way impressed by these sandwiches. This is sort of an up-jumped Quiznos with the added bonus that the bread starts out unbaked and bakes as it's going through the conveyor belt. However the ingredients going in to the sandwich seem fairly standard for fast food quality, maybe slightly better, and the flavor coming out the other end simply wasn't there for me. Yeah they're greasy gut bombs and people like that, but coming from the land of Bunk Sandwiches (greasy gut bombs that they be), this is nowhere near what I'd consider to be gourmet or even all that great.   Don't get me wrong. I'd take this any day over a McDonald's burger or similar. And compared to the vast array of gross casual food served on the strip, this is a step above. But I simply didn't encounter anything close to the 4- and -star raves people are heaping upon this joint.   The highlights include that the prices are totally reasonable for this part of town, and the tortilla soup is actually pretty good. But my caesar salad had some slimy brown lettuce mix in the midst of the rest of the sturdy romaine, and both of the greasy sandos I sampled were simply that. Greasy and salty and just okay.   For where it's at, I give it three stars. Anywhere else? I'd probably choose something with more flavor.",

The bacon was too thick on the BLT and for some reason smelled like peanut butter.  There's still so many more sandwiches for me to try though, so I'll definitely keep coming back when I go back to Vegas.   Service is still as quick as ever so don't be intimidated by a long line.  If ordering soup, check to make sure you got the right one!  They gave my friend the wrong soup and she didn't realize til we got back to our hotel room.",

Don't fall into the hype!  $7 dollar nonmeals for a subpar experience.  In fact the only reason i gave this two stars was because the muffin was good.  trust me subway's breakfast footling is more scrumptious than this.",

Well actually, I had to grab a Fat Tuesday, of course, but this was my second stop. It was around 3pm so the lines weren't too long. I ordered the Earl Club and it did not disappoint! I don't know how they make it, but it's sooooo good! I absolutely love carbs so the bread stood out to me the most - warm, light and flaky but chewy, all at the same time. The sandwich was pretty big - I only finished half of it and took the other half to-go. And for $7, it's reasonably priced.   The seating area wasn't too packed when I was there, but I can see how it would get crazy packed if there's a long line. It's self-seating so if it gets too packed, you can always have a friend save a table while you order!   I finished the other half of my sandwich a few hours later. It was cold so it wasn't as good as it was fresh, but it was STILL amazing! I'm so glad they opened up another location in Anaheim. I'll probably be going there more often!",

    "text": "Earl of Sandwich has turned into my new must-have go-to place to eat at least one time during every Vegas weekend!  Earl's is located conveniently in Planet Hollywood next to the casino in PH's Miracle Mile of shops and restaurants, making it an accessible location 24 hours a day, after a nice walk around the strip or a long night of drinking and dancing at the club!  It is easy to be intimidated by the long line in front of the sandwich shop, but the line moves cafeteria style and the wait is never long to pay and place your order. There is plenty of seating and tables as well as a few TV's on the walls to watch the game. The wait to sit is never very long either as sandwiches are pretty much fast food!  Soups start at $3 and sandwiches and salads/wraps are around $6. Plenty of selections on the menu to choose from to suit your tastes and cravings. My personal favorites are the Full Montagu and the Earl's club. The sandwiches are made hot and fresh and everything has always tasted great! I don't even like mustard but the Full Montagu turned me into a big fan! The chicken Caesar salad is delicious as well, with plenty of dressing, croutons, and chicken.   I make my decisions on what to order easy by grabbing 2 sandwiches and taking one to go! Perfect to eat after getting back to your hotel in the wee hours of the morning or on the long drive back home to So Cal! Just make sure none of your drunk or sober friends get to it before you do!  Now when are we going to get one of these in LA?",

    "text": "Whenever I visit Vegas (once or twice a year) I always intend on coming to Earl for their sandwich but never do because of their ridiculous line. So after this past Vegas trip for spring break with the girls we ended up staying at Planet Hollywood for a week.  Let me just say that for a week of staying here, me and my girlfriend ate here 5x in a row and made sure to buy 3 sandwiches before we headed back home to Hawaii. I've only tried the tuna melt because everything else sounded delicious but it contained meat in them (I'm a pescinarian). For about $7.00 a sandwich which is a huge and incredibly delicious sandwich it'll leave you tummy full, your mouth happy and you wanting and craving for more.   I like that the workers are very fast in making the sandwiches, they line does look long but it moves pretty fast. They do have a small dining area but we only did takeout so we could bring it back upstairs to our room. I like the fact that they only use one type of bread which is good so it doesn't leave you with thoughts of \"what bread should I get\" \"Will this bread be good\". It's perfectly toasted to perfection and the tuna and Swiss cheese just blends so well in the sandwich...*so simple but good*.   Friends tried the breakfast sandwich and he said it was yummy and another friend tried the American and she said it was perfect! But she still liked the tuna melt the best. Now I know when I'm in Vegas, EARL of sandwich is a MUUST go to especially because they are always open.",

I usually opt for the Tuna Melt but when the seasonal Holiday Sandwich is around, I can't resist... it's like the best parts of Thanksgiving stuffed into sandwich form (except pumpkin pie)! Turkey breast, stuffing, cranberry sauce, and mayo on the Earl's soft, freshly baked bread. YUM!   The line moves fairly quickly. You order your sandwiches (or salads or whatnot) at the first register, then move down the line and pick up sides, desserts, or drinks, then pay at the end where you're given a buzzer that alerts you when your food is ready.   Can't wait for the Anaheim outpost to open!",

It doesn't quite fill you up like a Subways Sandwich, but for $5.99, it's an amazing deal.  The Italian is absolutely delicious. The juices are strong and the meat is fresh. It was served quickly and devoured even quicker.  This place is an amazing place to eat dinner. Why spend $500 on a fancy dinner for two when the food is just as good here?",

The bread is amazing, while there was always a long line it moved a lot faster than expected. If you're looking for grub near Planet Hollywood, this is a great spot to grab it.  Pros: (all the sandwiches we shared) -Caribbean Jerk Sandwich - my personal favorite because I like a little kick.  -Hawaiian BBQ Sandwich - great combo. -Earl Club Sandwich - This one was good and then continued to grow on me as I ate it.  -Original Sandwich - Classic roast beef and cheese. -Earl potato chips - reminded me a lot of Boulder Chips. Love them. -Frozen Earl Lemonade - sour but not too sour, I kicked it up a notch by buying a shot of vodka across the way.  Cons:  -Long Line (but not that bad, it moves faster than you think and it gives you time to look at a menu)  Do yourself a favor and stop by the Earl of Sandwich.",

It is also open 24/7, great for pre-clubbing dinner, after drinking munchies, or the morning after hungover.   I either get the Earl's Club (turkey and bacon), Full Montagu (roast beef and turkey), or Holiday Sandwich (my favorite with turkey, gravy, cranberry, and stuffinggg that's now offered year round!!). Whichever you get, they are all nicely toasted with the cheese perfectly melted.   This is the best location in my opinion. The one in Disneyland is much closer to me, but their sandwiches just doesn't taste the same. Depending on the time you go, the lines can get a bit long, but they move really fast and it's well worth it!",

This location being in the mall makes it busier with a longer line than the ones I've been to in California, but it is still quicker than if we were to get a table and sat down in an actual restaurant waiting for service. There is a dine in area here that you can purchase your food and bring it to a table to sit down though, it might be hard to find chairs if you have a larger group of people with you. They mostly have sandwiches and salads, but the sandwiches are for sure higher quality than Subways and it's probably about the same price because I don't think any Subway on the Strip in Vegas would have the $5 foot long deal.   Great place for a nice, light lunch and you can probably order another sandwich to go for a little snack before hitting the club later that night.",

At only $6.99 each, you can enjoy one of their delicious signature hot sandwiches at any time of the day. Whether you come here for a quick bite during the day or to satisfy your drunk munchies, Earl's will always deliver.  I usually get the chipotle chicken avocado because come on.. just look at those ingredients: grilled chicken, bacon, avocado, and chipotle sauce!! But on my most recent Vegas trip, I tried a bite of the full montagu and converted over. The full montagu comes with roasted beef, turkey, cheese, lettuce, and tomato with mustard. Sounds like your typical, plain sandwich (which is why I never got it) but the flavors just blended together so well. I also got the tomato soup in a bowl for $3.99. SO. GOOD. Creamy tomato goodness topped with croutons.   If you're a first timer, I'd definitely recommend getting the full montagu because you really can't go wrong with it. There's a reason why it's the #1 review highlight on Yelp.",

So, medium-deep inside Planet Hollywood, border of Miracle Mile shops near Sugar Factory, is a high-traffic corner the Earl of Sandwich occupies.  Quick, reliable, and relatively affordable by Strip standards.  I liken the Earl to an ever-so-slightly-more up-scale Subway.  Sufficient, but still leaves you a skosh peckish.  Panini-style bread is soft and good, however the filling meats are not particularly abundant in the six-inch long two-and-a-half-inch wide sandwich.  Had Original 1762 Roast Beast (thin slice beef, cheddar horse-radish sauce) and Holiday Turkey (thin slice turkey, cranberry sauce, dijon substituted for mayo).  Verdict?  Good, but they be stingy with the meats.  Soups were tasty, Chicken Tortilla creamy and rich, and Chicken Noodle contained nice plump egg noodles.  Again, small was quite small.  It's possible I'm just a famished greedy porker though.  Don't say it.  What surprised and impressed me most:  Blueberry Muffin from their bake shop.  Cupcake-like in consistency and perfectly tasty moist.. YUM.  To go with it, Peet's de-caff is on the menu.. yiss!  The coffee dispensing from the thermos was not hot though. *womp wommp*  Open around the clock, The Earl's a solid convenient go-to option for a snack, if you happen to be in or near Planet Hollywood casino.",

I have tried to recreate it at home and cannot. So It's off to Caesar's once a month for this lunchtime fav.   As far as the store? It's located in the foodcourt at Caesar's Palace.

The idea of having two different kinds of meat in one sandwich for one price always appeals to me! Roast beef and turkey! I really like the mustard sauce they had in the sandwich. I also really like the bun they served; very fresh ; crusty on the outside soft and moist on the inside.  I also tried the Hawaiian BBQ which was pretty good. Just love the combination of BBQ sauce and pineapple.  I wished they offered a larger size as it's pretty small for my appetite. Definitely worth eating here again the next time I'm in Vegas.  Personally it doesn't seem like you could go wrong with any sandwich you choose from them. There's always a lineup and there's every reason for it to be; cheap and tastes great!",

The bread was soft, slightly sweet, and toasted with all the fresh ingredients.......PERFECT!    I needed to take one star out because it was too DIFFICULT to find a place to sit there.  The place was too packed...........  Anyway, I will be back for sure!",

    "text": "BEST SANDWICHES EVERRR.  Going to Vegas with my best friend for the first time as 21 year olds (oh heeeeyy), we didn't only anticipate gambling and drinking, but mostly where to eat!! This was number one on our list, especially since we stayed at Planet Hollywood.   What I love most about their sandwiches is the BREAD. It's so light and soo yummy. I've tried the Earl's Club, The Full Montagu, Tuna Melt (surprisingly super good, and I'm not even a fan of tuna!), and the Italian. Personal fave: The Italian. Such good sandwiches. You have no idea until you actually try them. And they're cheap, too!! Can't wait to go back to Vegas and eat here again :)",

Wasn't overly sweet like most tea.",

Located in ph towers Westgate ( the hotel we always stay at due to its awesomeness) Earl of sandwich has never let us down. Even though it is popular, the wait is never to long. They have a big selection of sandwiches which range from simple to complex combinations.  They do have other options but I don't know what they are because their sandwiches are just too out of this world. I like the \"All American\" the best. Its like a turkey dinner!  Its open 24 hours so this is a perfect spot for a late night cap after the club or a long night of gambling... We always order way to many sandwiches because our eyes are bigger than our stomach.",

    "text": "As a local, it would make ZERO sense for me to go to Planet Hollywood for a sandwich. So my 5 star rating shouldn't be misconsTrued as me saying I would frequent them all the time, but rather based on convenience and price compared to what you typically find in a Las Vegas casino. At $6 you would be hard pressed to find a better sandwich on the Vegas strip. Is it the best sandwich I have ever had? Certainly not. However, with warm bread, tasty meat and relatively quick service... you can't beat Earl of Sandwich. Added bonus is that it is directly across from the Sports Book... grab a sandwich and go sit and watch a game.  I agree with Misti that they have a major lack of options for not only bread but toppings and sauces. No oil and vinegar? How does a sandwich shop not have oil and vinegar? Sandwich is not overly filling, which could be either good or bad depending on how you look at it. Heading to see Peepshow? Probably don't want to sit through that on an overstuffed stomach! Grab some Earl and you will be good to go! I order the Full Montague (I believe) which has turkey and roast beef. Consistently good and they have not messed up an order of mine yet.",

I first tried this place around 12:30am - 1am, so it's good if you have a late night craving.  The first sandwich that I had was the Caribbean jerk chicken. This was my first experience with jerk chicken, and it was full of flavor. The bread was also nice and toast as well. The second time I went I tried the Earl club. Out of the two sandwiches that I tried I would say that the Earl club was better, because of there were more ingredient to add to the flavor. Both sandwiches however were equally good, and I would order them again.  What's really nice about this place is that they take your order really fast, and they make your sandwiches fast as well. There's also the added perks of being open late when you want a late night snack or something. In addition, all the sandwiches are 5.99, which is pretty good considering that things are usually more expensive in Vegas, especially on the strip.",

(ok, Lakers?!?) whoa! He was with his entourage with two big bodyguards holding tiny ipads (pretty funny considering how massive these guys were)  FF a day later, we head over to planet to try this sandwich that Lebron had (yes, thats what convinced J to try it). Ordered the Original.. and whoaa!! Best roast beef swich i've had! The bread is amazingg! It has the right amount of crunch to it. Best bread on a hot sandwich thus far.

Many tuna melts are too greasy, but this one was not greasy at all.  I considered skipping all the other restaurants I had planned to visit and just eat at Earl's for every meal.  My girlfriend doesn't eat a lot and got full about halfway through her sandwich, but she continued to eat anyway because it was so good.

Most places drown it in marinara making for a soggy sandwich.  There was the perfect amount. The meatballs were tender and tasty.  The cheese was gooey but not greasy. Awesome sandwich! It was crowded on a Saturday night but seating wasn't a problem. I got a pager to let me know when it would be ready and that only took a few minutes. If I'm in Vegas again I'll visit for sure.",

Their drink selection was quite bad.  The set up is like just get through the line already!!!  Pay me the money!! It is definitely Not a mom and pop shop, so why not go find one?  Please someone in Vegas find us a good sami shop!!!",

I always order the Full Montague and something else and while the something else is usually only decent, the Full Montague never disappoints. Definitely ideal after those drunken Vegas nights when you're ready to hit the sack but need a quick bite before going to bed. The only bad thing is they have the tendency to get real packed. I've seen the line reach all the way out to the main walkway where you enter from outside. As long as you avoid the rush you'll usually get your food within 10 minutes of ordering.",

Earl of Sandwich had a whopping 4500 reviews so I said \"why not?\" When I am traveling I like to eat at places that are unique to the city. I was disappointed when I found out Earl of Sandwich was not localized to Las Vegas and was in fact...a chain restaurant. I feel like I wasted a meal on this place when I could have had Gordon Ramsay's burger just 5 minutes away. It was my fault I did not do enough research to figure out this place was a chain beforehand.  I tried \"The Original 1762\" and \"Italian\". The sandwiches here are pretty small in my opinion. Are they the best sandwiches ever? No. They're slightly better than Subway at best but at least Subway gives way more for about the same price. I also got the mac & cheese and the tomato soup....PASS on those! The mac & cheese was poor quality and the tomato soup tasted off. If you're looking for a very quick bite to eat then this may be an option, otherwise, look elsewhere!",

I spent a good 30 minutes walking around Planet Hollywood trying to find them, but that was my fault for being silly and not looking at a mall map.  Finally when I got there I had the intention of ordering breakfast (I was hungover and just wanted some eggs) but they stopped serving breakfast at 11AM (I got there at 11:08AM FML).  Settled for the Chipotle Chicken sandwich and OMG it was sooooo good. I felt like I was coming back alive as I was eating it. I also had a side salad and that was good too.   Finding a good place to in Vegas is extremely hard, but this place is really good and will be a go-to whenever I need a quick bite.",

But even though the lines are long, they move fairly fast though.   I usually get the Original, which comes with roast beef, cheddar cheese and horseradish sauce. Amazing. It tastes consistently the same. I can not come here for a few years and order the same thing, and it'll taste the same as I last remembered it.   So you line up to order first, then they'll give you those pagers and you walk past the line with chips, drinks and cookies, and then you pay. The wait to get your sandwich is not long at all despite there being so much people here. Finding seating though is another question, even though there are plenty of seats.",

Not only is it perfect after a night of clubbing and you're desperately looking for somewhere open to eat, but it is good anytime!! I usually get the original club sandwich with white bread. You can also substitute the white bread for wheat! The bread is so crispy and that first bite in the sandwich tastes like heaven.  Not only is the sandwiches great here, but so is the soup! I saw on the menu, they had clam chowder, tomato basil, chicken noodle, and chicken tortilla! I can vouch for all of them because they ALL taste great. They come in either a small size or large!   Definitely swing by Earl's for a quick food run if you get the chance to when you are in Vegas! This is located at Planet Hollywood!",

It's not a large location but they have a system to take your order and call out you number on your receipt. I don't mind it as long as I get what I ordered.  These guys work hard and I always do my best to let them know I appreciate them.  The Family thought I was crazy to take a picture of myself in front of the restaurant. Oh well it's fun. Btw I couldn't decided on which sandwich to get so I got 2. The Chipotle chicken sandwich  It has grilled chicken, bacon, cheddar, avocado, lettuce & chipotle sauce and the Italian it has salami, capciosa, ham, mortadella, mozzarella, Roma tomato & Italian seasoning & zesty Italian dressing.

Don't get me wrong the Sandwiches here are alright but after seeing all of the rave reviews and 4.5 star overall rating I really do feel let down and expected way better than I got especially when they claim to be home of \"The worlds greatest hot Sandwich\". If you put that claim out there your Sandwiches better be pretty damn amazing. Sadly, no.  The Full Montagu (<a href=\"http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/earl-of-sandwich-las-vegas?select=bcK75Axd_C6o9qCvSOe-pw#7NJLUm9T5aCBtyZLQrdO3w\">yelp.com/biz_photos/earl...</a>) - $6.49. Yeah, it was cheap and hot but also fairly small. The Beef was a little under cooked for my liking but whatever, I know America likes their Beef still Moo'ing. No big deal yet then the Salad was also really sparse too and nothing really had that much flavor.   My Husband had the Holiday Turkey (<a href=\"http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/earl-of-sandwich-las-vegas?select=bcK75Axd_C6o9qCvSOe-pw#__Es78IE8ZJeG61x_gtvww\">yelp.com/biz_photos/earl...</a>) - $6.49 Which he said was and I quote ''fairly good''. He then went to on to tell me it was probably the best Turkey and Stuffing Sandwich he's got from a Sandwich shop but then this is only his 3rd so take that how you will.  The sad conclusion I came to here is that open a Sandwich shop 24hrs a day in a location where drinking is one of the most popular activities and set your prices low you're guaranteed to get great reviews.",

Compared to DTD, the tuna melt here seems a whole lot cheesier. Could be the alcohol remembering that, but it's always more tastier here. They do have tabasco packs to take to-go instead of trying to steal one of their bottles....not that I've ever done that.   Not so close seconds, but still pretty good chicken chipotle avocado and caprese. Compared to all other Vegas things, these are pretty reasonably priced.   Line can get kinda long, but it goes by fairly smoothly. And it's not that bad when you've got a good crowd with you to keep you company. Unless you ended up the most sober and had to do the food run for everyone.   Earl's is a must-try. It's cheap enough where you'll definitely lose more out on the tables.

    "text": "One of the best sandwich shops out there. Completely blows Subway and Quiznos out of the water in terms of the taste, quality, and freshness of the protein and veggies in addition to sandwich flavors. Additionally the bread is near artisinal, a sort of ciabatta-white bread fusion where the crust is crisp and the crumb pleasantly pliable. At $6 a sandwich, although they're around six inches, each sandwich is much heartier than the typical 6-inch at subway or quiznos. Around two sandwiches is perfect for a meal, albeit one will suffice for some. Even though the price comes out relatively pricey per meal, this sandwich joint is certainly worth a try, especially since it is open 24-hours.   Gladly ate here with friends for breakfast, lunch, as well as dinner as an alternative to the buffets in vegas, I would prefer six of these sandwiches over the $35/person buffet at the Wicked Spoon or other Vegas buffets. The Holiday Turkey Sandwich is a must-have along with The Original and Full Montagu. If only Earl expanded to CA.",

SERVICE: sucked BALLS. Immature workers goof around and flirt with each other. Take forever to make anything.  FOOD: Def, not the best. To me, SF has wayyy better sandwiches. Didn't like the bread. & the meat was just ok.  SANITATION: (most important to me) clean I guess  WHAT I GOT: pastrami sandwich.  SO WHATS THE BIG DEAL?? not sure!! I came around 3am. My sandwich was cold. bread was soggy. Someone please enlighten me!! girl took 15 mins just to make lemonade??!?! Maybe I came at a bad time...? wish I had a better experience, everyone seems to love it!  OTHER NOTES: -24 hours! -no hot chocolate!! =[[[[ I was really craving it. -Maybe everyone's buzz/drunk/hungover. making it taste better. LOL",

I had the original, tuna melt, chipotle chicken avocado and the Caribbean jerk. I would have to say my favorite is the tuna melt and the chipotle chicken avocado. The original is really good too with the horseradish. And the caribbean jerk has this sweet explosion of peppers. They're all so good! I definitely want to come back and get some more but I live too far... Next time during my trip back to Vegas, I will definitely try some other sandwiches. I did find there's a location in Anaheim. Maybe I'll have to make the trip down there.",

Lines can get really long here so if you can still stand straight after a heavy night of dancing and drinking then you in for a treat.   I've only order the Montague Sandwich Consists: Two kinds of meat: Roasted Beef and Turkey Two kinds of Cheese: Swiss and Cheddar Cheese, Top off with  Lettuce/Roma tomatoes and earl's mustard.   The bread is crispy on the outside soft and moist in the inside. I ate half before the club and came back after it and it still tasted the same. Now that's a incredible sandwich. I've heard the Tuna and Caribbean Jerk is also good, next time in Vegas I shall order them both and try it!  Oh and tips to the fellas if your night didn't go as well in the clubs meeting women, there are many of them from various clubs here standing or eating around Earl's. Time to redeem yourself fellas.",

I took out the Bacon and Tomatoes since I'm not a huge fan, but everything else was AMAZING.  The bread was ridiculously delicious - it had a gorgeous crust.  The sauce they use in the sandwich was really good too. You wouldn't think to find a good sandwich place like this inside a casino/hotel.  But def a really good find.

The jerk chicken was my favorite but the trick is to swap halves with a homie and try them all! I reccomend this spot for sure and it's in Planet Hollywood by the miracle mile mall....

Perfect place to stop by for a great meal at any hour!  Recommendations: Tuna Melt - SO GOOD. Good portion of tuna, and the bread in nicely toasted. I saved half for later.....yum. Bacon, Egg, Cheddar Breakfast Sandwich (offered til 11am)- The bacon is VERY good! It has the perfect amount of saltiness and is easy to bite through. I got this 2 mornings in a row. (We stayed at Planet Hollywood) Broccoli Cheddar Soup - Hits the spot! Nice and thick with lots of broccoli. Not too salty.  I also had one of my friend's brownie bites. Sweet and delicious! I can't wait 'til they build one near me in Downtown Disney. Hurry up, Earl's!",

    "text": "So I finally try this place not because of the hype, not because of word of mouth, but because I had tickets to a show at the Planet Hollywood theater. So with some time to kill, me and the wifey decided to have dinner before the show.   Sad to say, I have more negative observations than positive ones so let me get the negative ones out of the way so if you make it to end of this review, then at least you can reflect on some of the positives if you do decide to go here.  For starters they only have one size sandwich (6 inches) for 5.99. I had to order another sandwich just so I can have that satisfied full feeling. So 12 bucks for a foot long? Sheesh! They only use one kind of bread which is a ciabatta type. It's good but if they had sourdough or wheat it can give whatever choice sandwich you choose a whole nother world of flavor. For their meat whether it's chicken, ham, roast beef, or turkey, they put just enough for you to be able to taste it. Of course you can double the meat for an additional charge. Also don't forget you need a drink to wash it down. So more money out of your wallet. Just do what some people do. They ask for a water cup and fill it with soda. Won't be long before they start charging for that too probably. If you eat here at any time between 12 and 4 am, you're guaranteed to see drunk, fresh from the club, and high people gettin their hungry grub on. I don't know about you guys, but nothing good ever happens between those hours and Earl's is no exception.  So for the positives. Yes their sandwiches are flavorful, open 24 hours, (which is not always a good thing as described above), and at least you get free refiils on soda.   So if I just happen to be at Planet Hollywood for some reason and it's not the freaks come out at night period, I will have a sandwich or two if my wallet allows it.",

This one is located in their newer food court in connection to the casino and forum shops area. Comparing to the PH venue, they cant deliver the exact same experience, mainly because they dont handle your order as fast as they do.  Pricing is also unsuspectingly higher than on the other establishment and i really cant tell why. Do Caesars charge them for their premium location? Or did they just realized its possible to do so when the crowd may be wealthier?  To sum it up, they do offer the similar sandwich and its pretty sweet to let ppl choose whatever they like and join a table at the food court. But when the pricing goes up, the value goes down, even though its a pretty damn good sandwich!",

These sandwiches are really only OKAY, but they may be much better than okay if you are drunk and have been roaming the Strip all night.  I don't think much has changed since they opened, it is the same line-up (lots of people) eating there a majority of the time. There was a line when my friend and I ate here around 7:30 PM on a Thursday night. You get a buzzer and you then can find a table or stand around if you are taking your sandwich to go.  I had the Chicken Bacon Avocado, which had a good part and a not so good part. Good part was the Chipotle mayo on it was actually spicy and had a great taste. The bad part was there was hardly any avocado - a huge disappointment for me. Also, the sandwich I now have realized is not as amazing as it seems. Really, it's just another sandwich, and to be honest, it is smaller than most other sandwiches you will receive at other sub shops.  Probably won't be venturing here again.",

Unfortunately I'd eaten at capriotti's early that week and was more impressed.   Don't get me wrong the sandwich was tasty and the bread was fantastic, but the sandwich was small and I was expecting more meat. I'd definitely recommend everyone try it at least once. I ordered the full montagu, I'll try another sandwich next time.   I also ordered the tomato soup which was delicious and topped with croutons.",

Located Planet Hollywood on left side, don't be intimidated by the long lineups--service is friendly and fast.  Just have to serve your own coffee.  Ordered the BLT and tuna salad, nicely wrapped.  Not huge like Subway, but just right.  Probably a good thing.  Choice of chowder, which I found the clam one was a bit on the salty side, no repeat here.  While seating's huge, best to get someone to reserve a table while lining up.",

We ordered the Original, Full Montague, Hawaiian BBQ, and the Earl's club. I got to try a bit of all of those sandwiches except for the Earl's.   Taste is good but if I had to choose I would pick the Hawaiian BBQ. Chicken, ham, cheese, pineapple and bbq sauce goes really well together.    The price for the sandwich is fairly priced but it's not that big of a sandwich.  Probably the size of a 6 inch sub.  They don't put a lot of meat inside as well.  It's more bread than meat for sure.  Some bites had nothing but bread.    Definitely a good spot to hit up after the clubs though, using the bread to soak up all the alcohol and hopefully you won't puke it all out after.",

Located in Planet Hollywood, this was a convenient dinner choice after a long day working (Yes, you read that right) and not wanting to venture far for food.  I had just checked into the hotel and taken my bags upstairs and wanted to go somewhere easy and super casual.  This is a walk up and order kind of deal and it's sandwiches, easy 'nuf.  They say, \"You are what you eat\" and I have been told I'm All American on more than one occasion.  This sandwich is served hot with turkey, buttermilk dressing, cranberries, cheddar cheese, lettuce and tomato.  I'm not a huge fan of hot sandwiches (read: Quizno's) but everything coming off the conveyor belt smelled really good, so I took a chance.  I'm glad I did.  This has become one of my favorite sandwiches and I ate here the following night as well.  The service was quick and the location was clean and seated many people.  This will be a dedicated dining spot anytime I stay at Planet Hollywood or happen to be close by and hungry.",

Hawaiian BBQ: Kinda tasted like a pizza...which isn't a bad thing but it was not my favorite sandwich of the night 3. Italian: a good hearty cold cut sandwich  The chicken noodle soup was the perfect size for my palate and really hit the spot.  You just can't go wrong with chicken noodle soup...if ever there is a place that can mess that up, I will surely yelp about it.

The montagu was a solid sandwich but it was something I can put together. The one thing that I don't have is the mustard. Earl's mustard was sweet and tangy and delicious. If I based my review just on the montagu I would give it a three star but since I had the jerk chicken I'm giving this place a four star. The jerk chicken was really good. I love food with bold flavors. Loved the spiciness from jerk sauce and the peppers. Would love to go back to try more.",

My best friend got the thanksgiving sandwich [[i forgot what it was called]] but he said it tasted like thanksgiving one bite at a time--so no False advertising there!

I think I went through half of my sandwich and was stuffed! My brain was satiated by it's wonderfulness too quick that it tricked my stomach into being full. (No joke. That physically happens with a satisfying meal!):   My boyfriend got the Full Montegue that was amazing too. It had Freshly Roasted Beef, Turkey, Aged Swiss & Sharp Cheddar Cheese, Lettuce, Roma Tomatoes & the Earl's Mustard Sauce. The bread is toasted to perfection.

Make sure to stop by here if you're ever in Vegas! I'm craving it AGAIN!",

It's all about the bread here - amazingly fresh and delicious.    I even went here 2 days in a row - had the Caprese (really good basalmic dressing/sauce) and Tuna melt (who knew it could be so warm and satisfying?).  Even the sides are good - tomato soup, macaroni salad, and coleslaw.   Great place to stop by if you're hungry and want something quick to eat.  I would recommend going to Earl of Sandwich over Pink's.",

Seriously, the bread is that fresh!  and overall the sandwiches are that good , you can't go wrong w/ any of the choices here .  This is a must cheap eat in Vegas !",

Sometimes it's perfect and sometimes its dripping blood and when you bring it to their attention .. They say that's how its cooked .. I now only go for sugar cookies and their salad ... Though still not as yummy as the earl in Orlando .. So depressing :(",

I wasp laying a tournament and when one guy mentioned he was hungry, the rest of the table started to feel hungry. Someone mentioned Earl of sandwich and we all wanted it.  On our first break, a few players went to get it, but came back 10 minutes later with a sad look. They didn't have enough time to order and needed to be back at the table.  Glad I had a chance to eat here last year. For less than $10, you get a great sandwich, a drink and maybe chips. In Vegas, that is a great price.  The bread is fresh and good. Don't let the size fool you, the taste alone is worth it.",

    "text": "Firstly, I must tell you that I LOVE sandwiches.  I'll go to a steak house and order a sandwich.  I'll go to Leatherby's and order a sandwich.  I'll pretty much order a sandwich anywhere that offers sandwiches.  So with that said here I go...  I ordered two sandwiches.  1 Original 1762 and 1 Italian.    Original 1762 - comes with roasted beef, cheddar cheese and creamy horseradish sauce.  I really enjoyed this sandwich.  The horseradish was the only thing I was hesitant about.  It turned out very light and a good accompaniment to the sandwich.  The roast beef was good but had a few chewy fat pieces that were hard to eat.   Italian - Salami, Capicola, Ham, Mortadella, Zesty Italian Dressing, Mozzarella & Roma Tomato.  Sounds good right?  Who doesn't enjoy those deliciously salty meats?!?  Too bad they weren't real Italian meats.  More like the processed, packaged sandwich meat you'd find in the grocery store (not the deli).  The tomato was wrapped in the meat which didn't affect the taste but was strange in my opinion.  The best thing about this sandwich was the mustard.  I really like their mustard.  Very flavorful but not overpowering.  Overall I liked the Original sandwich the best.  The Italian sandwich just was okay and not what I expected.  Both sandwiches were nicely crisped and toasted.  The sandwiches are cheap but there really isn't much to them other than a couple pieces of meat, cheese and bread.  These are simple toasted sandwiches.  It's worth trying while visiting Las Vegas.  Next time I'll definitely stop by and have another sandwich.  Yum!",

Harley Davidson Cafe?  Hooters?), we finally decided to go across Las Vegas Blvd to see what we could find in the Miracle Mile at Planet Hollywood.  Located just inside the entrance, the Earl of Sandwich has a couple things going for it.  It's pretty cheap for the strip (around $6 for a sandwich) and for a cheap sandwich, the quality is pretty good.  I had the Cannonballs (meatball sandwich), which was decent.  It's no Genovese's (see my review) back in Alhambra, but it was passable.  My gf had the Hawaiian BBQ, which was very good.  Ordinarily I don't like pineapple too much (strange, since my dad's side is from Hawaii), but in this sandwich with the bbq sauce, it was really good.  The portions are worth the money, but not a place to go if you're extremely hungry (that's what the Buffet of Buffets is for).",

However they still manage to maintain full flavors in every bite.

I wouldn't recommend the mac & cheese either - it's pretty much Kraft Mac & Cheese with extra cheese (not terrible just not worth $4).",

The bread is pretty dense, and fills you up fairly well, as opposed to Subway or Quiznos which is all air.  The bread is crowning feature of the sandwiches.  It isn't cooked until you order your sandwich, and then your sandwiched it put through what resembles a pizza oven.  The bread is crispy along the edges, and yummy.  I wish they put more filling, and more veggies, though.  I ordered the jerk chicken, and my mom ordered the tuna melt.  It seems like it would taste must better if the ratio of bread to stuffing was more balanced.  They probably can't over-stuff it though, in fear it wouldn't cook completely.

Roast beef (tender, moist, delicious) + the tang of the horseradish sauce (MAN, I love horseradish) + the crunch from the toasted bread = the perfect equation for a hungry belly and somewhat dwindling wallet (when in Vegas, right?). For the price, you really can't go wrong, but Earl of Sandwich made it nearly impossible to ruin the good thing they have got going on there.   Also made sure that I tried their soup (hey, I was hungry), and I got their chicken noodle. Yum, perfect chicken noodle. Didn't take away from the sandwich at all.  Another must order from there is the Tuna Melt. I told my friends that it was the \"super better\" version of McDonald's. Scratch that, this can't even compare to McDonald's. Once again the crunch from the toasted bread made this sandwich spot on.   I was really hoping for such thing as a takeout/delivery to Hawaii. I'd be eating these all day errday! Hoping to go back to Vegas soon, specifically for these golden sandwiches.",

    "text": "Another popular and raved about sandwich joint I've heard so much about. And after seeing my gf's always post pictures of their sandwiches I had to try it out. But couldn't soak up the whole experience since I had a protein bar an hour before and was trying to avoid eating heavy since were going to go clubbing afterwards. Yes a very girly thing but hey, got to fit in my dress! just tried a few bites here and there. Went both friday and saturday and wanted to go back again. Something about the packaging reminded me of willy wonka's golden ticket that are hidden in the chocolate hahah. Can never get enough. Please come to LA Earl!  _The original, roasted beef, cheddar and horseradish sauce was pretty good. I loved the horseradish sauce! It really made the sandwich stand out. Although a little too much meat for me.  _The Full Montagu, roasted beef, turkey, swiss, cheddar, lettuce, tomato, and mustard sauce was one big juicy bite. Although it seemed a little too cheesy. I think either swiss or cheddar would be good but having both was a bit too rich for me. But I'm sure most like a whole lot of cheese. Luckily the small amout of lettuce and tomato helped a bit. _Chipotle Chicken avocado, grilled chicken, bacon, cheddar, avocado, lettuce and chipotle sauce was my favorite. The chipotle sauce was great and not too overdrenched. Every bite was better and just melts in your mouth.  _Baja Chicken salad, romaine, grilled chicken, cheddar, cilantro, avocado, tomatoes, roasted corn, black beans, tortilla strips, and red wine vinaigrette was refreshing. The salad was a bit small of a portion but not bad. Nothing amazing. But good to share with a friend and half a sandwich.   I would definitely come back and this time make sure not to eat any protein bars beforehand haha. And wear a more loose dress. Can't wait to go back and try the other sandwiches!",

    "text": "\"I was hungry in Vegas\" is not, exactly, a sentence you anticipate hearing. And yet, there I was, hungry-but-not-hungry. I saw Earl of Sandwich and suddenly: I needed a sandwich.  Now at the time (and amazingly for me), I had NO clue that this place had 4000+ reviews, nor did I know that so many of my Yelp buddies had visited, with mixed results. I was purely driven in by the lure of sandwiches.  I ordered a turkey club, a fruit cup, and a fountain soda. The price was OK for Vegas (and bear in mind I live in the Bay Area, so I'm used to high prices).   Guess what? I LOVED my sandwich. I didn't eat it all right away -- I stuck some in the fridge, when I got back to my room. I ate the rest later and I STILL loved my sandwich. Bread was nice and toasty, fillings were fresh and flavorful. Not too thin, not too thick. Just right.  The fruit cup was expensive, but the fruit was good quality. Not mushy. Tasted pretty fresh.  The fountain soda was a little disappointing (kind of flat).   But overall, if I ever return to Vegas, I'd seek out this Earl of Sandwich for a fairly fast, relatively inexpensive casual meal.",

The chipotle avocado burger had a decent amount of avocado and the chipotle sauce just made everything go well with each other. The brocoli soup was alright though, nothing special.   The reason for three stars was the worker Susana who acted like a total bitch the whole way. She literally threw the food at my boyfriend and when we told her our order was wrong she grabbed the bag, proceeded to making the salad (plus throwing all the ingredients in container) and threw the bag once again! But we weren't the only ones who had this problem. With a good place with good food, I think she really needs to fix her customer service skills.",

The actual content of the sandwiches is nothing innovating, but the bread is really delicious. The perfect combination of crispy and bready-ness without being overpowering over the entire sandwich as a whole. Really filling especially for the price. I've tried the original and the All American and both were delicous. I've also tried their desserts and definitely think it's worth the extra $2 if you have a sweet tooth post-sandwich. Overall, I give Earl of Sandwiches a 4 for being delicious and also inexpensive. The only downside is it is located on the Strip within Planet Hollywood and that can be annoying to get to if you're a local (which I am). Still delicious though :).",

Still, overall value is pretty good here and this is a pretty good option for late night eats. Day time you have so many other options though so I'd probably skip this  Food tried:  Italian Good flavor. The bread is ok but could be a little thinner.   Montagu(a bite) Good. Less flavor than the Italian.   Service: order at the counter and pay. Then pick up your order when you buzzer starts buzzing. Was not too sober when I ordered, but I don't really remember there being much offered in terms of sandwich customization.",

I eat them all the fucking time but I just can't stop because 1) sandwiches here are generally delicious, 2) there isn't an abundance of other great types of food in this area (flame suit on).   Given this, I have to say that Earl is vastly overrated. Earl of Sandwich is amazing because you're drunk and hungry after doing all those drugs and dancing in Vegas at 3 in the morning with nothing else to eat, not because it is anything special.I tried over four sandwiches on my one trip to this place and while they were all decent (the pastrami and chicken avocado as the stand outs), it ain't no 4.5 stars. Make sure to ask for some horseradish sauce on the side with your pastrami as it'll add a nice kick to your sandwich.",

I cannot taste the individual flavors of the meat, the cheese, the vegetables and bread. Each bite is just a mushy bland mess in your mouth. Textures are stomach turning. On our first visit, my in-laws threw theirs both in the trash after only a few bites.   Do not buy the hype.  These are worse than the plastic wrapped sandwiches in gas station coolers.",

(See picture) Both ends of the sandwich did not have any filling at all! I was very disappointed!  But I decided to come back on the second day. The Chipotle Chicken is tangy and spicy! I almost couldn't take it!!! But then again I'm not a fan of spicy food. The avocado made it super good tho!!!",

The bread was delicious, toasted and still soft and the meats were well made and didn't taste processed if at all.   I went 2 times and tried 2 different sandwiches. The turkey w/stuffing and then the pastrami/turkey. Both were extremely different but to die for. Will go everytime I'm In Vegas moving forward no doubt. Staff was friendly and the atmosphere was hustling and bustling. Fun times, yummy sandwiches, sides and all else.",

My guy friend told me about Earl of Sandwich in Vegas and he was ranting about how it's the best sandwich on earth. Intrigued, I signed up for Earl's club immediately and decide to give it a try next time I went to Vegas, which was this past weekend for my 23rd birthday. :)  I got to Earl's on Saturday around 12pm and boyyyyyy, the line was pretty long. But no need to worry because the workers there are super speedy and you'll have your food in due time! I knew which sandwich I wanted in a heartbeat, \"The Full Montagu\". Freshly roasted beef, turkey, aged swiss and cheddar, lettuce, tomatoes and mustard sauce. Mmm, just thinking about it makes my mouth water! I want some NAO.  Anyway, Earl's sandwiches are nicely toasted, which makes the outside crisp yet they somehow manage to keep the bread moist and soft in the inside. Cheese are hot and stringy while my mustard sauce gave a nice kick to the sandwich. I added some pepper that they had on their dining table, which wasn't just regular pepper. It was a little bit herby and tasted bombbbb. My best friend got herself the \"Hawaiian BBQ\" and she also loved her sandwich, which means a lot knowing she's a picky eater hah  And the best thing about my first Earl of Sandwich experience was that it was FREE (not that it's expensive to begin with). Yay, thanks Earl's club for my freebie coupon! I'll be satisfying my craving next weekend when I'm in Vegas again!  OH, ps., did I mention this place is open 24/7? You deserve A+++ in my book. :D",

The group of us ordered and shared five different sandwiches (Original, Montagu, Tuna Melt, Caribbean Jerk Chicken& Hawaiian). All 5 were pretty good imo. The Original and Caribbean Jerk Chicken were definitely my favorites. If I have to pick one, I would go for the Original! I LOVE the Horseradish sauce in it. It was tangy and complimented the roasted beef and cheddar perfectly! The Spicy Jerk sauce in the Jerk Chicken sandwich added a nice spicy kick and was outstanding as well.  I also liked the bread of the sandwiches a lot. They soaked up the flavor of the filling well without being soggy at all. Still retained a nice bite and chew!  Can't wait for their new location in Anaheim!( :",

Both of us had the holiday turkey sandwich (which was very good!). Stuffing, turkey, gravy, mayo and cranberry sauce all warmed on toasted bread. I know some complained about the small size but we thought it was perfect, as it is quite filling and dense.  We are both EATERS and did not eat our entire sandwich. My potato soup was good but nothing super special. Make sure to specify what size soup you want. I said \"cup\" (assuming cups and bowls) and they have me the largest size. Tasted fresh and good potato chunks. Hubby thought his tomato soup was okay. It had croutons on top and was pretty basic. We ordered our son a side of Mac and cheese and it was really good and a decent size. For these items and two regular drinks, our total was about $35. Pricey but typical Vegas. Worth the trip but would try the chicken chipotle avocado next time.",

    "text": "TL;DR: The BEST hot sandwich you will have. The End. If you don't believe me I will go into more detail, but really, ^^^ that is all you really need to know. Do not get fooled by going to the Cesar's Palace EoS, go to the Planet Hollywood one!!!  Location: So Earl's is located on the first floor of Planet Hollywood across from the Sports Book. Quick access to the strip, to the bar, to the gaming tables.  Staff: Every time I've been here, they have always been friendly.  Seating: Ample seating with standard chairs. NBD.  Food: Please refer to the first line of my review. If that doesn't sell it for you, I'll go more in depth... This most recent trip we ordered 2 sandwiches, 1 tomato soup & 1 pizza thing. Everything was great.  French Dip Review - Best sandwich at the table. **HIGHLY RECOMMEND** I am a fan of a good French Dip, and trust me, some sandwich spots suck at making them. Not Earl's though, perfectly cooked Beef & delicious Au Jus. If you order this, you WILL NOT be disappointed, everyone in my group had a bite and everyone agreed, this was the best sandwich of the day.  Chipotle Chicken Avocado Review - This sandwich was good. I felt the Avocado was a little over powering, but the chipotle chicken was a nice balance.   Personal Pizza Review - This is a well prepared personal pizza square thing. It starts with a delicious pizza crust bread, light and fluffy, then it is topped with a strong marinara sauce, topped with amazingly stringy cheese, Italian seasoning and delicious little pepperonis. If you aren't in the mood for a sandwich (which would be a huge mistake if you came here... like seriously, go somewhere else if that's the case) this would be an acceptable lunch item.  Tomato Soup Review - Disclaimer: I don't normally like tomato soup.. but this tomato soup is hard to describe aside from it is amazing. Aside from the great taste, the bonus kicker was it has some big croutons. Perfectly cooked croutons. Ask for extra croutons.  Chips Review - standard chips. get the salt and vinegar ones if you don't want to be let down.",

My first one back in January brought me to their Original 1762, with roast beef, sharp cheddar, and creamy horseradish. Absolutely incredible! Since then, I also tried their Earl's Club and Chinese Chicken Salad. The Club was great (you can never go wrong with bacon in a sandwich), but I highly suggest to request the dressing on the side when ordering any of their salads. Even though I mixed it pretty well, it seemed like majority of it appeared more than halfway into eating it. It grossed me out and sadly, I had to throw it out. But despite that, I'll always think of Earl's as a reasonable and tasty option when in Sin City. Ugh, I'm craving one now!",

Everyone in our group finished all of their sandwich, it was just enough to get us stuffed.   I tried the Full Montague and the Original Roast Beef. Both were delicious, the meat was juicy and tender and the bread was flaky and not too crusty. Our friend ordered the Caprese, she said it was delicious as well.   Total for 2 drinks, 2 sandwiches, and a bag of chips: $20. Not bad!   It definitely isn't the greatest I've ever had, but its certainly something to try!",

First we were in another casino, I really can't remember which one and it was past \"dinner\" time but we hadn't really eaten dinner so we wanted something to eat.  We looked up and saw a sign for a deli type place and it was actually called \"Snacks\".  We got in line at Snacks and it didn't move for like 5 minutes, which when you're drunk and you want fries that's way too long!  Plus the prices at Snacks were ridic.  So we said screw it, let's go somewhere else.  Somehow we ended up at Planet Hollywood and were looking for somewhere to get food.  That's how we found The Earl.    So we walk up to the counter, I didn't even notice the prices until after I ordered.  Great prices for Vegas!  So I ordered like a grilled cheese type sandwich and my friend ordered a Tuna wrap.  Both were delicious!  I must admit that cheese in my sandwich was probably not a good idea a little later that night BUT that doesn't change the fact that the sandwich was really outstanding!  And Cheap! And Fast!   I'm really even lucky I remember what this place was even called!  Oh Vegas...",

Both were delicious, piping hot with melted cheese, and fresh bread that was crisp on the outside and soft and doughy on the inside.  Did I say how good these sandwiches are?  I'm craving one right now.   Prices are excellent...this being Vegas, they could probably charge closer to $10 a sandwich and get away with it, but each sandwich is only $5.95 (or something like that).  What a deal!  Its location is convenient--right in the Miracle Mile Shops area, off of one of the casino entrances of Planet Hollywood.  Flat-screen TVs are scattered throughout the eating area, which was a nice touch.  Hubby could still watch his ESPN during dinner, haha.",

    "text": "I ate lunch here twice during a two-day stay in Las Vegas, and i recommend you make this your go-to lunch place. Located right on the strip, in the Planet Hollywood, just to the left of the main entrance to the Miracle Mile Mall.   This is a great first meal of the day, to energize you for the casinos, or cure your hangover from the night before. To order, line up, order your meal, continue in line to pay and order a drink.   If you arrive at peak lunch time, expect a crowd. However, for the amount of traffic, they are extremely efficient. If you're in a group, have one person scout out a table, because the seats are taken quickly.   To eat, the sandwiches are good, but the prices are ever better: five dollars for a medium-sized sandwich. There are also wraps, salads, and soups. Although I did not try a wrap or a salad, i can say that the Veggie sandwich was delicious, and that the \"Vegetable\" and \"Cheddar and Broccoli\" soups are so thick, that they no longer taste like a healthy option. All of the meals, including soups, are wrapped expertly, and labeled, for easy take-away.   Pro Tip: While you're at Earl of Sandwich, order coffees, and sit playing Penny Slots, while watching tv. Beware of the annoying Wheel of Fortune Countdown \"5..4...3...2...1\" at one of the surrounding machines.   Also, if not given a buzzer to claim your meal, hold onto your receipt as it has a number on it to claim your meal.",

    "text": "Sadly this place was a HUGE let down. After yelping a spot open at 3am, we headed down here and made the three mile walk to get some grub after gambling and drinking. In my mind I was set on a delicious sandwich with so many reviews, and 4 1/2 stars! We get there, and from the get go I kind of knew I was about to be disappointed by the red haired \"manager\" fella' that was talking about some inappropriate crap with his. what seemed to be teenage employee. He seemed in his late 30's, balding, and really doing nothing but slapping a sticker on the wrappers of the sandwiches. The only one I would give credit to, is the poor Hispanic gal that was literally making all of the sandwiches, and the Asian cashier girl who was very pleasant, but mischarged me twice. I ordered per the recommendation of the young kid, who I guess was on break as he stood there, watching customers stand in line while doing not a damn thing, the roast beef sandwich.   Grabbed my sandwich, and headed for the tables ready to chomp on this sub like a fat kid out of camp. Took a \"Jaws\" type bite, and had a Jaws type result of doing so.. the sub was BLOODY. I had an argument with my sister on how that's not coloring of the beef, but how it was raw and bloody. I was so furious after spitting up what i had just bitten, that I grabbed my drink and didn't even want a refund. The manager it seemed like was full of himself for someone who works at a sub spot, and I wasn't about to go to jail over a $8 sub. All in all terrible experience. I hope it was just that day, maybe the staff at that time? But would I ever try this spot again? NO! You go to Vegas to have a good time gambling, drinking and of course EATING!   Pros: There was a worldpoker tournament going on in front? Free refills I guess.  Cons: It's Vegas, so many other actual good places to chow down on, don't know how it got so many likes.  Overall: Save yourself the time, hassle, and money. This place is way too over hyped, and was really the only crappy thing about my recent Vegas trip. Mind you I lost like $500, and this was still the highlight.",

I've tried several of their sandwiches on my recent stays in Vegas including the full montagu, the caribbean jerk, and the italian.

You need to remember this because it isn't advertised on the outside of the building and we didn't see any sign so had to ask security where it was.  We picked this place for lunch based on the more than 4000 reviews and 4.5 rating.  The first thing I noticed were the dirty tables.  Then I realized it's set up like a Subways.  There were all sorts of salad items behind a glassed in counter.  You place your order and wait for it to be prepared.  Funny though, 3 out of 4 of us ordered various salads and they were premade but taken out of a frig..  There was nothing special about any of them.  One person ordered a sandwich, it was gone in 6 bites, very small and too expensive for the price.    There are far too many other places on the Strip to eat.  Skip the Earl.",

So good at an reasonable price ($6.99) for a sandwich on the LV strip.   The avocado Chipotle, Hawaiian, and Italian are also delicious.  Kids like the kids turkey and cheese sandwich and mac n cheese with bacon.   Desserts are good, but nothing fancy.    They are pretty much always busy, but the orders come out quickly.  I've had a great experience with their customer service every time so far.   The best part of this location is that they are open 24/7 for the late night after hours cravings.",

Open 24 hours with millions of options, I look forward to coming here whenever I come to vegas. The line often gets really long, but moves pretty quickly. They give a pager/buzzer thing so you could walk around the casino area while waiting for your food. I have to say I've had False buzzes which were truly upsetting, but once you actually get your food it will make up for it. I love getting the mac n cheese, but they have much healthier options like wraps. The vegetarian wrap and chicken bacon avocado wrap are both REALLY good. There's really no excuse to not come here, since its open all the time. Make sure to find your way here next time you're in vegas because there's something for everybody!",

Since I knew that a single sandwich wouldn't be able to curb a Vegas sized appetite I added on the Tomato Soup which of course is the perfect compliment to any delicious sandwich.  I went for the Full Montagu and Lauren V. ordered the Caprese sandwich.  If memory serves me correct I don't think we put down our sandwich after the first bite nor did we share with each other.  That leads me to believe that both sandwiches were amazing.  Easy solution for anyone thinking about coming here: just do it.  It's a steal for the quality of food.",

My respect to you from    The girlfriend and myself got a coupon for buy a sandwich and drink second sandwich comes free, from the front desk of Planet Hollywood  after we checked in.     Not having this place before we decided to stop in and try it out. Can't hurt to see what they have to offer eh?    The sandwiches on the menu sounded just outstanding. I grabbed the Italian myself well the girlfriend grabbed the club. She got to her sandwich before my saying that it was beyond anything from home.    First bite of the sandwich being the Italian and not a work of a lie, the softness of the bun is unmatched. A slight crisp on the outside that melts into the rest of the bread after you start to chew and by melt. I mean the bun literally melts in your mouth being coated in delicious juices not from just the meat but also the dressing or base they use for the sandwich.      As you chew on your first bite (if your lucky like us and have never had this place before) you will try to think of when a better sandwich for the price point has been has before. I doubt that one will come to mind honestly.      Halfway through the sandwich a big feeling of happiness waves in as I know I have not had a better sandwich to date. Finishing the sandwich you will be mostly full, maybe a little room for a small bag of chips or some brownies. For the major sweet tooth. Sugar factory is real close     As an out of town we never having this place before. Do yourself a favor and try it, maybe cry a little at how epic the sandwiches really are. I damn near did",

I arrived in Vegas, had lunch, and then took a nap because the time difference is brutal!  I had a Backstreet Boys show to go to that night, so I wanted to be wide awake for that.  So, I didn't end up eating any dinner.  After the show, I finally realized that I was super hungry and wasn't going to make it until the morning.  I was walking through the casino, and ran right into Earl of Sandwich, so I decided to stop here.  One reason I've never been here before is that I'm vegetarian, and they don't have a sandwich on the menu that I want.  The veggie one has too much stuff on it that I don't like, and I really just wanted a cheese and veggie sub.  I told the cashier, and she rang me up for a grilled cheese with the tomato, lettuce and avocado that I wanted added.  I paid and she gave me a pager, and I hung out for the few minutes until it was ready.  It didn't take long, and FYI, if you're a BSB fan, Planet Hollywood casino plays BSB videos on the big screen after their shows on Wednesday! :)  Once my sandwich was ready, which was maybe 10 minutes, probably less, I took it back to my hotel room.  It was REALLY good!  Maybe I was just hungry, so factor that into it, but it was really yummy and it quite honestly was one of the best things I ate in Vegas.  Add to that, the prices here are way better than some other locations.  I went to the one at Caesar's a few days later, and each sandwich was at least $3 more, and it wasn't as good!  This spot is easy to find.  If you're looking at Miracle Mile from the Bellagio, go in the entrance to the mall on the right, and you'll walk right into it.  If you're in the casino, you should also find it pretty easily.  It's on a corner, so it's in the casino and in the mall.  Definitely worth a trip for good and fast meal.",

During my last visit, I had the roast beef with cheddar and horseradish--I think they call it the original 1762. Bread was fresh, roast beef tasted of good quality, but no wow factor. Maybe I'm just ordering the wrong thing? I'm not sure. Still better than settling for something terrible like Subway. But this place does not meet my expectation of premium, gourmet sandwiches.",

Service & ambiance: They are open 24/7 and whether it was a day visit or 2+ am sober up visit, they have always been well staffed to take care of high volume. There's a long counter to order up. You put your sandwich order in on one side, and pick up any other snacks, bottled drinks, desserts, etc as you walk down to the cashier to settle up.  You're given a buzzer that notifies you when your fresh sandwich is ready.  Sandwiches:  I've tried so many throughout the visits but the Original 1762 and the club are my go to eats usually.  Regardless, the sandwiches come out hot when they're supposed to and the ingredients are fresh.  They might be a little on the smaller side for the price but what is lacks in quantity it definitely makes up in flavor.    Whenever I'm on the strip and happen to be in the area, I'll swing by Earl of sandwich if possible.  Their consistency of tasty sandwiches at any time of the day keeps me coming back.  Enjoy!",

I typically end up getting the Chicken Chipotle Avocado or the Full Montagu and the veggies+bread are always on point. But honestly, you can order anything from their menu and it'll be pretty safe. Just a warning tho, their sandwiches are a little small so I will often order a side of tomato soup or even two sandwiches if I'm really hungry. Nevertheless, excellent sandwiches any time of the day and you won't be disappointed!",

They only have one size of sandwich, which is kind of a bugger because I am a biggums and would have liked a larger sandwich. But the price was good so I can't complain for it being too expensive for the size of it.  One of my friends got a salad and it honestly looked like something you would get at a gas station. So caution, if you come here, definitely get the sandwich and not that 2nd class crap they call a salad.  I got some of their Earl Grey Lemonade and I am pretty sure I drank some of Satan's",

The wrap was chilled and well organized. The lettuce was crisp and the avocado spread smoothly among the chicken and tomatoes and bacon. A filling wrap.  The Italian was freshly heated and flavorful. Another hearty option for this quick service restaurant.   A nice variety of breakfast sandwiches. They also had a mix of grab and go items, such as granola, yogurt, chips.  A healthier option than nearby fast food or deep fried foods. I would definitely recommend this restaurant for future trips.",

I ordered Caprese on whole grain bread. Firstly, bread was nice and crispy, well-toasted on the outside and soft on the inside. Olive oil sprinkles over a few slices of tomato with a large piece of mozzarella and some lettuce just added to the deliciosness of the sandwich. Sliced in half, it was gone within 10 minutes. I considered buying one to go, but was a bit hesitant bringing it to the concert at Zappos Theater (good idea, because they did not allow any outside food or drinks).  There is plenty of seating available, but because of the proximity to the casino, it is impossible to get away from nasty smoke. That is by no means the restaurant's fault, so no stars taken off.  I would come back any time I am in the area and am looking for something quick yet tasty.",

Yes it may not sound like much, but its freakin delicious! Always hits the spot for me. I also really like the sandwich bread they use. I've tried other sandwiches but the Full Montagu has to be my fave.   I've also tried their tomato soup which is pretty good! They top it with chunks of bread.

I let my sandwich sit and wait for me to devour when I get back to the hotel since we know they don't have microwaves in Vegas hotels (ugh).  Anyway, ordered 12 to take home for friends & family and last time I brought home 17. Earls, why are you soooo good that I have to see you everytime, or else it's not a vegas trip lol.  I personally like this earls because it's spacious and conveniently located inside Planet Hollywood where I love to drink an AMF right after. Also it's a few dollars cheaper than at the food court inside Caesar's!",

I ordered the Tuna Melt ($7.49) and the Holiday Turkey ($7.49).  The Tuna Melt is a safe pick - it comes with albacore tuna salad, swiss cheese and mayonnaise. It was delicious. The sandwich was warm and toasty.   The Holiday Turkey is literally the thanksgiving feast all in one sandwich! It comes with turkey, cornbread stuffing, gravy, cranberry sauce and mayonnaise. Very delicious!   The sandwiches may look small, but they are very, very filling! Yum!",

And a salad section if you are trying to be healthy in vegas.   Given the stellar reviews of all my yelp friends are other reviewers, I thought this joint would blow my socks away. But in the end, it made me feel like a sandwich is just a sandwich.   I tried the full Montague, The Original, Tuna Melt and Hawaiian BBQ. Out of those, I thought the Hawaiian BBQ was the best. If you like slightly sweet flavor, you will like it. I was prepared to be impressed by the Tuna Melt, but it felt short for me. The other two sandwiches were just slightly above average sandwiches.   All in all, I would eat here if I was drunk and needed a late night snack or need to save a bit of $$ in Vegas, but other than that, I can't recommend going out of your way just to eat here.",

    "text": "So some of my friends told me we had to try this place out when we went to Vegas... I didn't quite understand why we drove from LA to Vegas to try out a \"Sandwich Shop\"... until I actually GOT THERE, saw the damn place, tried the food, and realized it was a \"Sandwich SHOPPE\". Yes, those last two letters, \"P\" and \"E\" are what made all the difference!   We are not talking about some poorly copied Subway knockoff, we are talking about a quaint little store, filled with personality, AND filled to the brim with people enjoying their customized, fresh, made in front of you sandwiches. Think a slightly more expensive version of Subway, but with a lot more class.  The bread was pretty damn fresh, I think I could have had mine a slight bit more \"toasted\" on the inside, but you could seriously taste the freshness and the yumminess in it! And the goodies that went inside? Oh my, pretty darn good. Not thrilled with the \"All American\", I felt that their turkey was a little on the dry side, but then again, turkey is a very hard animal to cook and keep moist. Loved the fact that each sandwich had a good chunk of \"goodies\" inside (my friends and I ordered three different types, and split among ourselves), and I also loved the fact that it was easy for us to cut it in even pieces to share.  A little expensive for my college student budget, but I don't mind splurging once in a while for good food... I'm always down to try new food to Yelp. Yes, Yelp, I dedicate my foodie adventures to you. Overall, I felt that the food was a 3.5, but I'm rounding up cause I greatly enjoyed being able to share this meal with many good friends, family style.",

But when I came here sober before my drunking raid, I ordered the french dip and the chicken noodle, but the chicken noodle was cold, the fuck?

    "text": "I'm not familiar with the Earl of Sandwich chain, but the whole Tudor imagery thing seems so very 70's. And yet somehow it appears less ludicrous in Vegas where everything has to have some theme no matter how contrived. This busy sammie shop is in the middle of the hubbub of activity in the Planet Hollywood's never-ending Miracle Mile Shopping Center. Gee, maybe it would have helped to have the staff dress like a cut-rate Masterpiece Theater production of \"The Six Wives of Henry VIII\" because the food deserved a beheading.   OK, it wasn't that bad ...just unexceptional. It reminds me of the equally mediocre Cosi chain in New York where they serve up sandwiches between flattened, toasted buns over-doused with dressing. I had the Veggie, which had feta cheese, lettuce, a Roma tomato, cucumber, red onion, roasted red peppers & Mediterranean dressing (see my photo). I just remember that it was mostly wet and turning quickly into a sponge as I was munching it. The Tomato Soup almost saved it, but it was scorching hot...why oh why do chains always do that?   FOOD - 2 stars...unexceptional veggie sammie...off to the gallows with you and Anne Boleyn  AMBIANCE - 2.5 stars...one busy mall with jiggling masses of cornbelt tourists in heaven here  SERVICE - 2.5 stars...it's just a line and a tray  TOTAL - 2 stars...the Earl needs to be exiled to Togo's",

You'll just end up marrying a hooker. That's worse than a stripper if you're wondering.  So as I wanted to adhere to this rule system, my BF & I paid a visit to the Earl of Sandwich before going out for drinks and gambling. For $5.99 these sandwiches are a crazy good deal! I had the roast beef w/ horseradish and I loved how the bread is nicely toasted. I highly recommend if you're looking to get a quick bite.  Oh and when we stepped back out on the strip I told the man handing out fliers to my BF that he already had a naked girl...but thank you!  Yelp 365 Challenge: #33/365 (The Rules)",

And I don't even know what the flavor was; it wasn't chipotle, chicken, or avocado. It was so bad that I ate half and threw the other half away. That's saying something because if I can eat one thing for the rest of my life, it would be sandwiches - I really love sandwiches - so imagine how bad it has to be for me to throw it away.

What we ordered: The Full Montagu (Roast beef and Turkey with Swiss and Cheddar) - This sandwich was just less than OK. Absolutely nothing special about it. I believe every sandwich comes with 'lettuce' and 'tomatoes'. Wait what? WHAT LETTUCE? WHAT TOMATOES? They were so dinky; there was absolutely no crunch from the lettuce NOR juiciness from the tomato. This sandwich was just so dry... I had to drench each bite with the mustard provided at each table to keep from throwing the sandwich across the slot machines. The Cobb Salad -  Again nothing spectacular about this salad. I'm a Cobb Salad fanatic, and I can honestly say I've had far better from grocery store deli's. They really do skimp out on everything :(  I feel semi-bad for bashing on this place... but I'm utterly disappointed that it was all hype. I believe the 4.5 stars comes from its convenience and price, not the quality of food. I can see this place being OK drunk food since it's open 24/7.  What I recommend? Save your $6 and walk over to Chipotle a few minutes down the strip. Get your money's worth!",

The quality of the meet is good and the bread is fresh, perfectly toasted every time.  Lunch goes great with their soups, my favorite is tomato!  Best part is the cost, you won't go broke and you get a good meal.",

D. A & C E. B & C  Brings back painful memories of the SATs, huh?   The correct answer is E! Yes, this question is totally ambiguous but, it's also True that I ate 4 sandwiches in 3 visits. And as icing on the cake, I had a bite of my friends Tuna Melt. I've had half the sandwiches on their menu and I've never had one I didn't like. It's an addiction and really the BIGGEST reason I would continually stay at PH Towers. And at $6.48 (tax included) a pop, you can save the money, eat like a king or queen, and then blow your new found savings on Wheel of Fortune.   But seriously, these are the best sandwiches I've ever had in my entire existence on Earth. Period.",

First off, this joint is 24 hours effin' hours. Well yea, of course, in the city that never sleeps.  And it is in Planet Hollywood, so it is somewhat in the middle area of the strip.  The menu is not extensive but there some variety. The sandwiches can be hot, as a salad, or as a wrap. They offer soup too!  Tried the Veggie Sandwich and All American Sandwich - both equally as good. But they load the sandwiches with lots of meat so don't be surprise by the density of it.  The frozen lemonade is good too. Sugary and sweeeeet.",

Maybe I was just expecting too much, or maybe most people who have reviewed this have never had a sandwich with artisan bread, but it was a pretty mediocre sandwich.  I tried both the Full montagu and the hawaiian one.  Both were similarly unimpressive.  Could've used an extra slice of meat to balance out the thickness of the bread.  Don't get me wrong -- the bread was good... though it would've been nice to have more variety.  But then it's not really my way.  The sandwiches are pretty much done as an assembly line so there's not customization.  Better than subway?  Sure.  Worth the money?  Yeah.  Worth the hype?  No.  Would I come back?  Eh... don't think so.",

The sandwiches are really very tasty, service was very nice and prompt, and are a tremendous value. For every other meal in Vegas I shelled out at least $15-20, the sandwiches here are $7. Grab some chips to go with it and you're still looking at less than $10 for a very good meal. I can only imagine that they can turn a profit because of repeat business because they're so much more affordable than other restaurants around them. I ordered an extra sandwich just to take on the plane with me.",

Luckily for me, a few of my friends that went with me were \"experienced\" in this matter, so they suggested we go eat at Earl of Sandwich. First off, my group got there VERY late, so I thought they had closed.... NOPE. Earls is a 24 hour place which makes this one of the best places to go for late nights and just regular meals.   As for the actual food, it's pretty damn cheap for what you get: a quality sandwich for under $10 (and when I say quality, I mean quality). I tried a few sandwiches here (got  2 on my first trip, and came during different times of the day), and they're all pretty good. I tried my friend's soup which wasn't the best, but still decent for what it was.   The lines can get very long since this is one of the few 24 hour food places, but the wait is quite small. Service is fast so don't get turned away by any sort of line.  Overall, a great place to go to at Vegas. Not a standard recommendation when you go to the City of Sin, but definitely a place to stop by if you're around Planet Hollywood.",

The place is 24 hours which is always a good thing in my book. Lines can be both short and long depending when you go. The first time we went, we went around noon and the line was long but moved pretty quickly. The second time, we went just 30 minutes earlier and there was no line. Don't worry about seats, there's enough seats to go around.   I ordered the Full Montagu and the boy ordered the Earl's Club. Loved my sandwich and even the boy who hates mustard loved it as well. In my honest opinion, the best part of the sandwich was the bread! Crunchy on the outside and soft on the inside. On our second trip to Earl's, we both ordered two sandwiches each (one for lunch and one for the road) and even after a few hours on the road, the sandwich was just as good as it was fresh!",

I'm in Las Vegas with my homies...me and my buddy Jerry are walking through Planet Hollywood and need something that won't take too long. There's a bit of a line but it's moving at a decent pace. While in line we decide on splitting two sandwiches since it's our first time and we want to try two. We are still looking at the menu trying to decide on what two.  Jerry says \"let's get three.\" I say sure, why not? We were hungry. All these sandwiches on the menu sound so tasty. Almost at the front of the line when I look at Jerry and say \"Let's get four.\" Done. In Vegas, go big or go home. We ordered:  -The Original 1762 -The Full Montague -Caribbean Jerk Chicken -Cannonballs!  I love that they label the sandwiches.The Original was HANDS DOWN the best quick hot sandwich I have EVER had. OMFGWTFWOW. It was like a sliced prime beef sandwich with the perfect amount of creamy horseradish & cheese. They don't skimp on the meat. Basically, if you like eating prime rib, you'll effing love this sandwich. The bread was good, not too airy. During my 6-night stay, I returned two more times just for the Original*. The other sandwiches were okay. One time I came here before a noon poker tourney and I saw there was no line. I was so excited until I got to the register and was told by the manager that their computers were down. I told her I'd overpay and I don't need change. DONE & DONE! By the way, this branch is 24/7 !!!  I pray this place comes to my hometown of Chicago, or I might have to open one myself. No bs.",

With two breakfast sandwiches and lunch sandwiches together with two cup of coffee, totally only cost us around $24 bucks including taxes.  Not only the price cannot be beaten, the quality and taste of the food were so great. We want to come back for more. The bread for the lunch sandwiches were soft and not dry at all. The sandwiches were warm. Very nice factor for good quality sandwich",

I could have easily eaten two of them before getting full.",

So of course the next day for lunch I wanted to go to Earl of Sandwich. It was around 1:00 PM and there were only a couple of people in line. I ordered the Caribbean Jerk Chicken sandwich the Wisconsin Cheddar soup, and the frozen lemonade. Way too much food but I had to try everything. Oh my goodness!!! It was all so good. Best sandwich I have ever eaten. It's a little pricey but I think it's worth it. I suggest you buy everything and share it with someone so you can enjoy different things and not get too stuffed. I definitely recommend this place and if I ever cross paths with another Earl of Sandwich I will without doubt eat there again.",

    "text": "Earl of sandwich is a great concept and the menu is super enticing.  Prices are fair, quality is average.  The turkey is in the form of cold cuts (not roasted like Capriotti's) and mirrored the quality of a Quiznos or- worse yet- Subway.  The bread here is baked fresh to order and is fluffy on the inside and crispy on the outside- yum.  The All American sandwich was okay, but again the quality of the turkey was off putting.  It had cranberry sauce, buttermilk ranch, lettuce, tomatoes, and cheddar.  The fellow reviewer who said this sandwich trumps the Bobbie must have had a few too many, I mean really.  The tuna melt, however, was great- very simple with just tuna salad and melted cheese, but delicious.  If you like tuna melts then this is the place for you (that might have been a 5-star sandwich!).  Potato salad was average and they have a selection of other salads and kettle chips.  There is also an assortment of baked goods, unfortunately the chocolate cupcake we tried was yellow cake mix with chocolate frosting (lame!).  The earl gray lemonade was refreshing and delicious, and I loved that it was something different.  Major props for having good vegetarian options (veggie sandwich with feta and peppers and a caprese).  I'd probably come back for the tuna melt and an earl gray lemonade, but I am shocked that this place has better ratings than the much superior Tom Colicchio brainchild Witchcraft (which uses vastly superior ingredients and has more exciting offerings).  Mad props that it's open 24 hours.",

    "text": "For most people, a \"must go\" list in Vegas probably includes some mix of casinos, entertainment, nightlife, and fine dining.  A regular Vegas visitor in recent years from LA before moving to LV this summer, Earl of Sandwich worked it's way onto my weekend list... every weekend... if not every day of every weekend.  There are few low price ($6)/high quality food options on the Strip, which makes the Earl stand out even more.  In spite of having eaten here probably ~75 times over the past few years, it has been hard for me to try different items.  Here are my top picks: Sandwiches: Hawaiian BBQ & Full Montagu Wraps: Earl's Cobb (no bacon, no ranch, add mustard) & Mediterranean Chicken Salad",

    "text": "Even if you don't particularly like sandwiches, you owe it to your future lineage to try this place.  It's hard to put into words how good these sandwiches are.  I'll leave it like this:  The 'Holiday' sandwich is the best tasting concoction to ever enter my mouth.  It's an entire thanksgiving dinner toasted between two buns.  I shouted curse words in the dining room after the first bite, it was that good.  Not to mention the sides... the sides are delicious as well.  Try the potato salad, or the macaroni salad.  Yum.  If the 'Holiday' is too intimidating for your rookie taste buds, give the Original a try.  You really can't go wrong.  The only con is that it is located in the god-awful Planet Hollywood hotel, but don't let that dissuade you from having the best sandwich of your life.  You owe it to your future children.",

    "text": "My expectations were way too high going into this place. After reading spectacular Yelp reviews and seeing the most beautiful sandwiches ever on the posters, I was ready to be blown away. Yet as I sit here writing this review, I find myself clearly not blown away.  With that said, I did enjoy the flavors of the Full Montagu and the Earl's Club. I preferred the taste of the Club: smoked bacon + turkey = delicious, roast beef + turkey = meh.  My biggest complaint was the amount of filling; I was reminded of those generic store-made donuts with the pea-sized amount of jelly inside. I felt like I had to savor every morsel of meat like a homeless child on Christmas. Ok maybe I'm exaggerating a bit, but I did feel seriously scammed by the meat to bread ratio shown in the posters.   The sandwiches are A-OK for me. But the price and location on the strip bump it to 4 stars. I wouldn't go out of my way to have it, but if I happen to be nearby and too hungry to wait for a buffet or steak & eggs special, then sure, I'll be back.",

FRESH FRESH FRESH!  Sandwiches are made to order = Awesome!  tried the Hawaiian BBQ (w/grilled chicken), the Earls Club (BLT Turkey and cheese) sandwiches.. (both $5.99/each).   The Hawaiian BBQ was good, but it had a lot of sauce and not enough chicken.  I don't eat red meat though so my options were limited.  I do love The bread is the same for all sandwiches, and I'd say it's the best part!  Funny that there's 'entertainment tax' on your receipt.. its about 10% of your order!  Wow, talk about self-tipping!  I wouldn't wait in a long line though - unless you're a starving college student partying on a budget  ;)",

    "text": "This place must of figured out they're on The Strip because the serving sizes have gotten tiny.  I used to eat here all the time when I worked in Planet Hollywood, so when a friend and his dad wanted to grab a bite to eat at a reasonable cost I thought of this place. Dad was staying on Strip, so even though my buddy is local like me we both kinda drew a blank at first on what was close and not stupidly priced. I remembered Earl of Sandwich as being moderately priced (decent sandwich prices considering portion but they get a little greedy when you look at the drinks. Whatever, its the resort corridor, nothing new.)  so I recommended them. It was a busy weekend night, lots of dumb half naked tourist girl herds to navigate through but knowing what I had before I felt it was kinda worth the twisted and intentionally confusing descent into Strip shopping hell. When we finally got our order it was a shock for me. 48 bucks got one beer, two regular fountain drinks, a little cup of soup and three tiny little hot pocket sized sandwiches. Ingredients were still pretty good and the sandwiches themselves, though pretty skimpy on everything especially meat were good also I was kinda blown away by the portion sizes. It's a Tourist Joint now, and the prices and portions reflect that. They're very efficient, food was fresh and hot, customer service fast paced and pretty normal vegas- polite... but they're a bit more brisk then they used to be. Expanded seating area, they can accommodate a large group. Not too many workers eating there when I was there, and I think I know why.",

    "text": "I love that they are open 24 hours and budget friendly, for being on the Strip. Especially after a long vegas night, you want something warm and wholesome to make you feel better and get right back in the action! Super simple, quick and easy on the belly. Whenever I'm feeling under the weather or even hungover, Earl always comes to the satisfying rescue! They also have a full blown bake shop, to satisfy anyone's sweet tooth. Great variety of gourmet muffins, cookies (jumbo sized or cookie bites), brownies or for the healthier option fruit parfaits.   * Chipotle Chicken Avocado - Favorite! Grilled chicken, bacon, cheddar, avocado, lettuce & chipotle sauce. This sandwich is very straightforward, but the combination of flavors are awesome! This is my favorite sandwich on the menu. The chicken is moist, avocado is buttery, the chipotle flavor is mild, but it all works very well together! Rated: 5/5  * Caprese - Simple, yet packed with flavor and freshness! It's your classic caprese on a toasted sandwich. They add a fair amount of thick juicy slices of mozzarella and basil. They also top it with a dreamy balsamic glaze. It's definitely a love at first bite situation. This sandwich also paired very well with the creamy tomato soup. Rated: 4/5  * The Original 1762 - The bare basic. Moist roasted beef, melted cheddar, and some horseradish sauce. The roast beef was tender and flavorful. I didn't detect much cheddar and the horseradish sauce flavor was very mild. It's easy on the stomach, especially if you knocked one too many down and need some help sobering up. Rated: 3/5  * Hawaiian BBQ - Not my favorite. A large piece of chicken breast, BBQ sauce and 2 slices of canned pineapple rings. The construction of the sandwich made it messy; the insides slid around and made it awkward when I bit the sandwich. The sandwich was overwhelmed by BBQ sauce and canned pineapple flavor, nothing exciting. Great concept, but poorly executed and not memorable. Rated: 1/5  * Holiday Turkey - Turkey, stuffing, turkey gravy, cranberry sauce & mayonnaise. The overall flavor fell flat. I didn't taste the holiday flavors that were advertised. Nothing really stood out, so it all just became a bland mush. Rated: 3/5  * Tomato soup - Yum! Very creamy and comforting. It has a bold tomato cream flavor and I really love the freshly fried croutons, they added amazing texture and flavor to the soup. It's my favorite soup here and always pairs well with all of the sandwiches. Rated: 5/5  * Broccoli Cheddar - Tastes just like Subway's version. Not too creamy or flavorful, more on the bland and watery side. Rated: 3/5  * Brownie - $2.29 A classic brownie that's moist, fluffy and tasty. I took two bites and saved the rest for later. It's huge! Rated: 4/5",

I had the classic sandwich, it was on a nice toasted bread, quality was fresh, and it was warm. It was so good.  But at Vegas, I tried the chicken chipotle and holy moly, it was so dang delicious. One sandwich is enough to fill me up but I wish I had enough room AND time to eat another one. I can't wait for the next time I go to Earls.",

But there wasn't a lot of avocado in it.  There's also extra condiments on the table if necessary.  Definitely try the earl grey lemonade if you like them separately! It was surprisingly good, perfect combination of the two :)  The price was also very affordable, definitely will be back!",

But when I opened it I cannot see any tuna, it was way too vinegretty for my taste... I thought it would be more savory than sour. There was only a hint of tuna sauce, I almost thought if they messed up on my order until I went online and saw the picture of the spicy tuna. I was not a big fan.... but my friend ordered the tuna melt hot sandwich and I got to try and it was great! I loved it! Totally should've ordered that one. I just wish the wrap was more like the sandwich ... at least not sour ... there was really not much tuna in it to be honest but a lot of pickled pepper.",

When they opened a location in Downtown Disney, me and my sister were just ecstatic (We go to Disneyland a lot). Now that I'm living in Vegas, what do you know, there are 2 more locations! One in palms and the other in planet hollywood.  I've tried the sandwiches in both locations. One is busier than the other.   However none has disappointed me yet. I feel Earl of sandwich is always consistent, no matter the location. My favorite go to sandwiches are The All American, Turkey Holiday, Tuna Melt, Chipotle, and Italian.  Warm crispy sandwiches are just way better than cold sandwiches :)",

Don't get me wrong the sandwich was still good, it was mediocre tasting and nothing to rave about. =X Goodness, I hope I don't get shot for this review!!

All weekend long during our last trip, Jeffrey insisted that this was the mecca of sandwiches, the end-all be-all of clubs, the epitome of deli meat & cheese nirvana.  We ordered, we sat, we ate, and well, let's just say, \"NBD.\"  J got the club, C got the tuna, D got the BLT & I got the original.  The club was okay, but I'm not big on those anyway.  The BLT had a decent amount of bacon in it, and was nice & crunchy.  The original was okay, but the meat was too dry for my taste.  I'm not big on the sauce, so I opted for just a little mayo, but that didn't quite cut it.  However, the cheese is pretty yummy & it melts just right.  Honestly, the best of our choices was the tuna.  It was pretty freaking yummy.  Thank god she got it cause then I wouldn't have had anything to eat, lol.  Oh, and their chips aren't so bad.  Price is what you'd expect to pay for something located in the middle of a shopping center in LV.  So be it.  Oh, but you'd have to walk the daytona 500 from parking or from the street, so don't bother making the trip if you're not gonna do something else within close proximity.  I could give the tuna alone 5-stars, but seating's limited, especially when they're busy.  Service isn't really anything, they just take your order & buzz you when it's ready.  Oh, but our cashier did make some jokes, so that's always a plus.  Give it a shot.  Maybe after you've had a shot.",

I ordered the Italian and was a bit surprised when it arrived warm - all the Earl 'signature' sandwiches are served panini style. As noted previously, the sandwich is about the size of a 6-inch Subway. I probably would have liked the sandwich better had the meats been cold as I was thinking more of a Hoagie style Italian. I also ordered the broccoli and cheddar soup - which was quite good.  The next morning we had breakfast at the Earl of Sandwich - it is the only place in the Miracle Mile that opens before 7 AM - it's Vegas Baby - and my wife was attending a conference, so we needed an early breakfast. I had the egg, cheddar and bacon sandwich and my wife ordered the ham variation. Both were quite good.  Fast service, reasonable prices and a decent sandwich makes the Earl worth a visit.",

As great as everything else looks, I'm too obsessed with those to order anything else! Freshly baked, soft warm bread that melds perfectly with the other ingredients. I usually eat half there and save the other half for after the clubs. They also offer soups, salads, desserts, and wine and beer, too! I've brought back sandwiches to LA for Earl-obsessed friends, and that earns me the best-friend-ever title in their books.

If you're looking for a good daytime meal to tide you over between buffets, this is the place.  About $10 gets you a sandwich, drink and chips.  The bread is crisp, the contents are delicious, and in the end, you're left full and satisfied.    When I don't know what to get for lunch and I'm on the strip, this is where I go!",

Although the queue was long, did not have to wait for more than 10 Minutes. Ordered for Caribbean Jerk Chicken.   Sandwich was just of right size, which won't make your stomach feel heavy.  Its tasted good, light and healthy.  A good option, when compared to other fast food joints on strip.   Located inside Planet Hollywood near Race and Sports Book.  Open: 24 Hours.",

    "text": "When my friend excitedly turned to me on the way to Vegas and said, \"ooh I have to take you to Earl's!\", I had no idea what a treat I'd be in for.   My first experience at Earl of Sandwich was pretty amazing. Long line, but it moved rapidly; not much seating, but people always vacating periodically.  The highlight, of course was the food. I got the Chipotle Chicken Avo and an Earl Grey Lemonade, my friend the Club and a tomato soup. We ended up swapping halves of the sandwiches, and so glad we did!  The Club is buttery and moist and flavorful--crisp veggies and crunchy bacon and yummy turkey. The Chipotle Chicken Avo--WOW.  It's moved onto the list of sandwiches that I will periodically crave randomly.  The chicken is super moist, the cheese, avocado, bacon, and lettuce balance perfectly with the slightly spicy chipotle sauce, and is all sandwiched between chewy and crusty artisan bread.   Friend loved the tomato soup (she was fan from before) and my Earl Grey Lemonade was pretty good as far as Arnold Palmers go.   Second experience was after a hard night's partying and before a long charter bus ride back to LA. I ordered on the phone for pick-up and was pleasantly surprised that it would only take 5 minutes for my sandwiches to be ready.  A short walk from the Cosmopolitan, I was back in time with our sandwiches in time to make the bus.  We got the CCA again (how could we not?!) and the Full Montagu... Which, sadly paled in comparison to the Club from yesterday.  Still hearty and filling, but in juxtaposition with the two others, just a tad bland.    When back in Sin City, I will definitely hit up the Earl again.  At this price and quality, I'd be a fool not to!  Plus, it's open 24 hours--and offers some dangerously delectable looking desserts.",

    "text": "I wasn't sure what to expect from this place after realizing it's inside of a mall, yet the thousands of Yelpers did not let me down. Earl of Sandwich has a large selection of hot sandwiches at very reasonable prices compared to other places on the strip. Most of the entrees are $7, and you can get out with a fountain drink and chips for about $10 total.   I ordered the Caprese sandwich and I would definitely recommend it for vegetarians and meat-eaters alike. The fresh mozzarella was delicious and creamy, the bread was nicely toasted, and even the balsamic was good. The tomatoes were a little flavorless, but this isn't the season for fresh tomatoes anyway.  I'll definitely try to make a second trip out here before I leave to try another one of their sandwiches. There are other good restaurants in Vegas, but none of them come close to the bang for your buck that Earl offers.",

I enjoy going here with friends for a light meal when I do not feel like pigging out. Definitely try The Full Montagu sandwich. It will not disappoint.  The desserts are pretty tasty too, which was surprising. I recommend sharing the desserts, because they can get a little too sweet for one sitting.

I just recently acquired a newfound love for sandwiches and this one takes the cake. The bread is warm, crusty, and chewy. It's the perfect vehicle for the delicious creamy chipotle sauce with just enough kick. The chicken is juicy and seasoned perfectly. The avocado adds another layer of creaminess and well, the bacon, come on, everything's better with bacon. This was the best $7 I spent in Vegas. I am so glad another location opened up in downtown Disney so I can eat to my hearts content.",

And on top of this, the food was cheap (~$5) and it was open at 2 am.  What's there not to like about this place? It's nearly perfect.   I say nearly because I got super excited when I saw their breakfast menu, only to find out they weren't serving it. I would recommend they don't backlight huge signs with pictures of breakfast front and center if they aren't serving it - but I guess its marketing. Overall a minor gripe in the grand scheme. I still found my delicious custom ordered sandwich in spite of it.   If you haven't been, go!",

They did enjoy the mac and cheese though, but it could have easily just been repackaged Stouffer's.  They didn't make my wrap until I walked back up and asked why people who haven't paid yet are getting called before me. Apparently if you're order gets looked over, there's no way of knowing that it wasn't made until you go up and say something. The manager who was there could not have been less concerned.

Environment: This place was in one of the casinos so the environment is... well it's Vegas, what else do you want? They have some tables for seating, and since most people come and go fast, it isn't that hard to find seating.  Service: Mostly service is consisted of the cashiers and the sandwich makers. There isn't much to say about the customer service for the tabling because that doesn't really matter here.  Food: Amazing sandwich! I got the hot turkey sandwich because I wanted to try out the cranberry sauce and stuffing since one of my favorite sandwiches is the Bobbie at Capriotti's of Culver City. Man... the sandwich at Earl surpassed my past experiences with that kind of sandwich elsewhere! It was very balanced and did not sog up the bread, but it kept it moist at just the right amount. The balance kept the flavor in without an over dryness of bread. My friends got other hot sandwiches and it seemed everyone liked their sandwiches. Some came by again the next day!  Overall: 4/5 Good place for sandwiches, you should definitely try this place for a small bite when in Vegas.",

    "text": "Honestly, I think people just like this place because:   A) It's cheap, when everything else is expensive in Vegas  B) It's open at all times for all the drunks. I liken eating the food here at 4 AM to the woman you're talking to at 4 AM - you likely wouldn't be going the same thing at noon.   With that said, I'm probably not the best judge as I just got a tuna wrap and it wasn't any different from any other tuna wrap I've had. I don't eat most of what's on the menu at the place, so I am sure some of their meatier options are decent.   Also, I am pretty sure a bottle of water here is almost $4. It's tough for me to support any supposedly economical place with that kind of pricing.",

Cheap but great eat on the Strip!!! I wish they have one in San Diego. Will definitely beat the hell out of sandwich shops here.   The service is fast, and lots of places to eat, despite the long lines and crowded restaurant. I shouldn't have gone for the Hawaiian because it's too sweet, but what boyfriend ordered was good. Just can't remembered what he ordered; just remembered it was good and wished I ordered it. I think the secret to their sandwiches is they make their own bread. Would come back again if I'm in town.",

    "text": "First and foremost, THANK YOU to Yelpers Michelle \"Shell\" B. and Bubba N. for suggesting this place to me!  My brothers, friend, and I went for our first lunch in Vegas. After a ridiculously laborious trip from Downtown to Planet Hollywood, we were there. Another few minutes were spent navigating the maze that is PH to the Earl of Sandwich, and alas it was time for lunch! The line itself was scary, but went by in a flash. A line that could have easily taken 45 minutes took maybe ten. The girl taking our orders was nice, but not much in the way of conversation or greeting. She did, however, keep that line moving. The sandwich selection was plentiful, but not so much that it was overwhelming. There were a few treats to look at as the line made it's way down the counter to the registers (chips, fruit, drinks, cookies, etc.). I went with the Caribbean Jerk Chicken sandwich. It was delicious! My only gripe was that the jerk sauce wasn't as sweet of as spicy as I would have like, but it will not stop me from ordering it again. The bell peppers and banana peppers were excellent! My brother and my friend each got the Hawaiian and holy crap was it good! Ham, barbeque sauce, and pineapple make this sandwich shine, it was definitely the best of them all. My other brother got the Full Montagu and it was the least favored. All in all, it was a good sandwich. It had roast beef, turkey, cheddar, swiss, and veggies. Our problem with this one was that it was a typical sandwich. Compared to similar sandwiches from other restaurants, this one is far better but there was nothing about this one that stuck out or made it special like the other sandwiches.  I'm glad I found this place, I'll definitely be back!!!",

The Italian was still very tasty though. For $5.99 flat price for a decent size sandwich is awesome for Vegas. I wish we would have eaten here on our earlier trips to Vegas so we would have saved time pondering where to eat all those times. Our son enjoyed his $3.99 child size Pizza Sandwich; which I thought was a good price for the size.   I do not recommended changing any sandwich in anyway. Just order it the way they come. They aren't labeled the greatest sandwich for nothing. They created the sandwiches to taste their best they way they come. A friend of ours didn't agree with our opinions on the places but they totally changed the sandwich and without it as a whole it doesn't sound as though it was as good. Find one that you will eat and don't \"F\" with perfection! LOL.",

My little girl had the Tuna melt with Albacore, that was good too.  The Italian was also good but I don't like submarine type sandwiches which this reminded me of.  My daughter loved it though.    The size of the sandwiches are pretty large we all had some to take with us.    This place is located in Planet Hollywood, which took a while to get to.

I don't think I waited more than 10 minutes in line even during \"peak\" lunch hour. Step 1) You order at the first counter where you are handed a buzzer.  Step 2) You pay for your order. Step 3) Wait for your buzzer to buzz. Pick up your food from the counter at the end.  I've tried the Earl's Club and the Chipotle Chicken Avocado. Earl's Club is WAY better in my opinion: turkey, bacon, Swiss, lettuce, tomato & sandwich sauce.   I don't think I'll be ordering the Chicken Avocado again. I know it's popular, but I personally don't like the sweet chipotle sauce.",

During my last visit, they had a Limited Edition special going on where you can order a BBQ Chicken or Philly Cheesesteak sandwich which is exactly what I ordered. Just thinking about them makes me crave them as I write this review! The meats were so tender and succulent and the sandwiches were easy to eat! I just love how they aren't made so thick and that they cut them in half so you don't have to do it yourself. Wait time to order varies and seems to go rather quick. You kind of have to be a bird with an eagles eye when it comes to finding a place to sit. Be quick and own that table after someone leaves haha...   For my fellow germaphobes, there is a hand foaming sanitizer placed against the wall near the fountain drinks and if you need to use the restroom, you'll either have to walk towards the casino to use one or into the mall, take your choice. Definitely stop by if you're in the area. It's a great pick me up if your stomach is crying for attention.",

    "text": "How can you make a 100 oz. Fat Tuesday tub baby with 3 extra shots of Everclear even better? By pairing it with an Earl of Sandwich sammich, of course!  I was reserving my 200th review for a place that I considered near and dear to my heart, and Earl of Sandwich is just that!  I have been here countless times. I'm sure I have also been here without any recollection of eating here .. or of the night :)  Although I try to order something different every time, I always find myself devouring the Full Montagu. What can I say? It just tastes right with my hurricane + octane + 3 extra shots Everclear / 151 FT concoction! Or maybe it is just that being inebriated dulls my decision-making ability. I also tried the bf's Caribbean Jerk on my last visit... not something I would have ordered myself, but surprisingly really awesome!  I usually eat here during normal eating hours (mid-afternoon, dinner), so the wait is not bad, even though there will always be a line. It would be cool to check out this place post-clubbing hours, but there are so many graveyard steak & egg deals around the Strip that I have not made this place an option yet.  Like the opinion of fellow Yelp! friend Michelle F., a Vegas trip without a visit to Earl of Sandwich just feels incomplete and disappointing. But now that Earl of Sandwich will be extending its franchise this summer to Downtown Disney Anaheim (most likely with shorter opening hours), I will get a chance to try every sandwich on the menu after all!",

The prices are Vegas-affordable. $7-ish to $8-ish for a sandwich.. I say it's worth it rather than spending on an junk food chain.  My ultimate faves are the:  *Full Montagu -Roasted beef and turkey, swish and cheddar cheesem tomato and mustard sauce. ---i mean.. it sounds so freaking simple but trust me.. They have this touch. Their bread is pressed perfectly and the meats are great.. no after taste whatsoever. It's Bomb.  *The Italian - Another simple staple known at every sandwich place.. I tried this last time coz i told myself I have to get something else other than the Full Montagu or the Reuben... I liked it.... Yummmmmy  *Reuben - ooooh i just love patrami and saurkraut.  *Chicken Tortilla Soup - i have no idea why we got this on a perfectly hot day; but it felt great. total hangover cure.  *Chocolate Brownie: Eh. Mine is better. I like how it's not too sweet. But i wish it were more moist. I swear their pastries toward the cashier are flirts.   I overheard this one chick behind us at the line speaking highly of their Pasta Salad.. Too bad they didn't have it when we were there...  But i've tried their Potato Salad in the past even if i hate mayo coated things; and it was pretty good....  *and yo..if you ever eat here.. please don't come soaking wet in your bikini unless you're like supermodel hot. (meaning.. no hanging tits and butt cheeks where other people may sit-- supermodel=classy OK?). Tacky.  HIGHLY RECOMMEND!",

But let's be honest, it's Vegas and you are in a mall at the entrance of a casino so if lots of noise isn't your thing, you may struggle wherever you go. Now the food - excellent, superb, fabulous- their tag line is \"we made the first sandwich, now we make the best sandwich\" is spot on.  It has the ambiance of a Subway, but the quality of your local sandwich shop with its fresh amazing bread and ingredients. If you have lost most of your money and need a yummy inexpensive dinner to give you some happy back this is a great option.",

Speaking of not special, the sandwiches here... add them to the list. Are they good? Sure. Are they great? No. Call it a step above Subway (2-stars) and a Step below a Capriotti's (4-stars). I do appreciate the price point (I just payed $19 for an omelet elsewhere), but, to me, Earl isn't really pulling me into PH anytime soon. In the area and need a quick bite? Do it?

It's definitely a Las Vegas staple for me every time I visit. Usually, I stay at Planet Hollywood, which makes it so easy to enjoy this place more than once, but this visit we're staying at another hotel. I still made the time to visit! Anyway, you order with the first register. You pick up snacks and sides and beverages along the way to the second register where you pay. The potato salad is sooo good, and I'm picky about potato salad! The brownies are a good dessert, too! For two sandwiches, it comes out to $14.03 (with tax), which isn't terrible... because they are quite filling! Overall, another excellent visit to my favorite sandwich place!",

Their bread is probably why their sandwiches are so popular. Slight crisp on the outside but so soft and moist inside. It also helps that most of their sandwiches are full of cheese! My favorite! Nothing better than melted cheese combining all the ingredients together. My friend actually recommended the tuna, and I was like what? Who orders a plain old tuna melt at the most popular hot sandwich place?! Well, I was proved wrong because their tuna melt was probably the best I've ever had. Rich and creamy, and full of cheese! Every bite had a long strand of cheese pulling apart, and I just couldn't get enough of it! Even after finishing my Full Montague, I was stealing some tuna melt from my boyfriend.   Thankfully, the two of us ordered 3 sandwiches (because we're gluttons), and we were stuffed at the end. The third sandwich was the All American, and it was really good too! The cranberry sauce made it sweeter, and the roasted turkey was also juicy and tender! I actually preferred the All American over my Full Montague, but maybe it's just because I'm not a huge mustard fan. My friend ordered a tomato soup along with his sandwich, and it was too sour for him to finish. Basically, just stick with the sandwiches! It called Earl of Sandwich, not Soup! Also, they're opened 24 hours!!! I can't think of a better place to go when you're hungry and drunk. It's seriously the best idea ever. Definitely one of the highlights at Vegas!",

I'll be sticking with my tomato and basil soup knowing that there will not be any meat surprises.  Generally, this is a chill environment located right next to the casino area of Planet Hollywood hotel. Best thing is that it is open 24 hours so good sandwiches are always available but beware of the rush hour when crowds form and the lines get long.   Bottom line, my friends went to order second sandwich after eating their first ones which justifies the 5/5 star rating!",

My thought was, I flew hundred of miles to Vegas and a sandwich is not exactly glamorous or fancy!  We stayed at the Cosmopolitan and so Planet Hollywood is literally right across the street.  It was 3 am one night and my boyfriend was hungry, so I thought hey why not?? It's close by and it's open 24/7.  I got the tuna melt and my boyfriend got the Original.  IT WAS AMAZING.  Seriously.  I know it's just a sandwich but it was seriously the most delicious sandwich I've ever had in my life.  The bread and temperature was right on point.  And if you factor in the ridiculous cheap price to get this piece of heaven, no wonder why this is ranked #1 on Yelp for Vegas! So glad the fat girl and boy in us were craving for food at 3 am and had Earl of Sandwich introduced into our lives.    My boyfriend made me walked back here 3 times to get more sandwiches.  Mind you, we were in Vegas for only 3 days.  We both love the Chipotle Chicken Avocado sandwich the most.",

If it had had only 3 stars, I might have given it 4.. but for being someone who's had A LOT of sammiches, this place is a 3. Solid 3 stars, but just 3 for me.  I get that this is Vegas and nothing outside of McD's costs less than $10, but I felt like this was a glorified Subway with worse customer service. My caprese was small (could have easily eaten two) but the bread was enjoyable because it was toasted. I actually came here after reading the Yelp reviews having SKY-HIGH expectations, which weren't met and quite frankly left me with a sour chain-deli taste in my mouth.  Perhaps I'm spoiled coming from the SF bay, and I was sober when I ate here (and I'm sober now that I'm writing the review) but heck.. I found this place disappointing and not deserving of the 5 star ravings.",

I also love the location, if I remember in my usually non sober / sober when gambling state it's in PH so that makes it great for me and a nice location on the strip.  Anyways, check it out in Vegas.

    "text": "2.5/5  The fifth scotch went down like water. I stumbled through Aria's magnificent mall, eyeing expensive Kiton  and Tom Ford suits, wishing I had been born an heir to some vast fortune. \"I deserve something nice.\" I had told myself.  Only a single twenty remained in my wallet after an unfortunate losing streak at the roulette table. Food. I can get food. A bridge later, I was inside Planet Hollywood, ready for the \"best sandwich in Las Vegas\", as it had been touted by fellow yelpers and friends.   Earl of Sandwich seems like a typical sandwich place, and in many ways it is. They have a small sandwich collection, non-existent side dishes, and ordinary prices. It's not without its charm, and I have to say that I love their logo, a wigged Englisman with a look of condescension emanating from his profile. I decided to go with the Turkey and Bacon sandwich, while my girlfriend ordered the Original.  My choice was underwhelming. The bread was the best part, nice and crisp, with a bit of a cheese baked into it. However, the quality was not much better (if that) than something from Panera (their asiago bread is very similar to the bread used at Earl of Sandwich). If I had to pick the overarching theme of Earl of Sandwich, it would be saltiness. I know that bacon and turkey are processed and that nitrates and sodium are a given, but the salty taste was just so in your face that I couldn't even finish my sandwich, even with the dreaded \"drunk munchies\" I get after having a few ounces of  Johnny Walker Red Label in me. They are about 7 inches long, which is 7 inches too much to eat when a sandwich is that salty. My girlfriend's sandwich was better, but not by much. The horseradish in her original sandwich gave the roast beef a bit of a kick, but that saltiness still prevailed in the end. It was edible, however, and I ended up helping her finish hers.   I can't recommend the turkey and bacon, but the original is okay. It's decent, something a little better than Panera (if that), but not worth going out of your way for. Described as a sandwich pilgrimage, I had expected more from the little shop. Perhaps the alcohol dimmed by tastebuds, but I find it hard to believe that less than half the people who eat her don't have at least half a stomach full of alcohol anyway.    Sir Earl of Sandwich, you let me down, and I challenge you to a duel! We'll do it right after I stop having these massive fart attacks from your sandwiches.(rounded down for massive farts caused by this establishment)",

OMG thanksgiving in a sandwich!!!!!!  and the jerk chicken was spicy slices of chicken with a lot of peppers.  it was just all incredibly juicy and flavorful.  even though there were a lot of people, the line moves pretty quickly and your sandwiches is done in less than 10 mins.    it is open 24 hours and inside planet hollywood, with plenty of extra options like brownie bites, chips, cookies, beers, frozen lemonade, salads, and so on.  highly recommended to fellow sandwich lovers, usual sandwich haters (like my bf- but he loved this!), and just late night gamblers in general.  a good, cheap place to catch a bite to eat!",

Only thing I haven't liked there was their Hawaiian sandwich, but maybe that was just a matter of preference.

    "text": "So I'm just gonna say it...this is THE BEST sandwich I've ever had!!! The Thanksgiving Holiday one is sooo freaking good! I tried the Thanksgiving one and The Full Montagu, which was also good, but hands down, The Thanksgiving one is THEE BEST!    Do you remember the 'Friends' episode where Ross gets mad about someone eating his Thanksgiving sandwich that Monica made for him with \"the moist maker\"? Well I always remember imagining what this sandwich would taste like with \"the moistmaker\" and now I know what it tastes like!! This is it!  The stuffing is \"the moistmaker\"!!! The cranberry sauce gives it the perfect sweetness for the sandwich. And turkey...and that's it! SO SIMPLE SO DELICIOUS!  This sandwich is that good that I ate it 3xs during my Vegas trip...got everyone I was with obsessed with it too, then brought 6 sandwiches back home for myself, family and friends to also experience THE BEST SANDWICH EVER!  And that wasn't enough because I think about and crave it soo much and was soo sad when I ate the last one! Now that I'm writing about it, I'm tempted to hop back on a plane to eat it ;)  It's crazy because it's a simple fast food sandwich shop and it's THIS GOOD!  It's also open 24 hours which is AWESOME!  It's the bread...it's crack bread :) Do yourself a favor and order this sandwich to experience it in your life! WELL DONE EARL, WELL DONE!!  Tip- it's located in Planet Hollywood casino right next to mall opening",

The workers appear to be trained to handle large crowds of people.  The way the line worked was very efficient, and I liked the use of the buzzer system to speed things up.    The prices are reasonable for a sandwich ($5-6.50), and the combinations are creative and delicious.  I ordered the Holiday Turkey Sandwich (because why not? Tis the season!), and it tasted like a mini Thanksgiving dinner.  It was juicy, the bread was slightly crispy but still soft, I was in food heaven.  However, the sandwich was waaay smaller than I expected! Still good, but finishing it just left me craving more.",

I love the artisan bread they have and that everything is cooked fresh when you order. Most of the time my friends & I stay in PH so this is convenient for those late night cravings cause it's open 24 hrs. Usually you'll see a long line but don't get intimidated the cashiers are usually fast.  On to the sandwiches: Hawaiian BBQ - MY FAVORITE! If you've had Papa john's hawaiian bbq chicken pizza well this is what it tastes like except better cause of their bread  Earl's Club - pretty standard turkey sandwich, but the bacon adds the extra crisp  The Full Montagu - MMM the aged swiss & cheddar cheeses melt in your mouth combined w/ the delicious roast beef & turkey slices  Carribean Jerk Chicken - love the spicy jerk sauce. don't worry it's not super spicy or anything you just get a tangy kick. the red & yellow peppers make it great  Sigh writing this review makes me want to go to vegas now to grab one of their sandwiches :( thank god they are opening one at downtown disney so it's closer to home!!",

    "text": "After seeing so many people review them on Yelp, I was stoked to finally check out Earl of Sandwich.  From the way people hand them five stars and how they've earned about 1,800 reviews, it's like they're sandwich royalty!  When a couple of my friends and I stopped by to grab a quick dinner before meeting with everyone else, we fully expected to run into a line.  Given their popularity, we figured it wouldn't be a question of \"if\" there would be a wait, but \"how long\", especially since we were going around 7:00.  Much to our surprise, there wasn't a single person ahead of us when we got there.  Score!    Since my friend and I both wanted to try a couple of their sandwiches, we decided to get two different types to share.  While she ordered The Original 1762 (Roast Beef, Sharp Cheddar, and Horseradish Sauce), I ordered the Italian (Salami, Capicola, Roasted Ham, Mortadella, Mozzarella, Roma Tomatoes, and Italian Dressing).  Even though I tried to set aside any expectations I had, it was tough trying to block out the reviews I read.  While the sandwiches were decent, they fell a little short for me.  With all the hype though, it was bound to happen.  - The Original 1762 (<a href=\"http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/DkYS3arLOhA8si5uUEmHOw?select=REJJpOEpwaK0fLvh-bKn0g\">yelp.com/biz_photos/DkYS...</a>) - it's essentially a roast beef sandwich, but its simplicity worked.  The roast beef and sharp cheddar were nice, but it was the horseradish sauce that did it for me - potent enough for a kick, but not enough to be harsh.  I wish the meat had been a little more medium rare than medium though.   - Italian (<a href=\"http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/DkYS3arLOhA8si5uUEmHOw?select=k8Po4fzJS9cgJcYsOdhfrw\">yelp.com/biz_photos/DkYS...</a>) - okay, but I think the Hot Italian at JJ Boulangerie at the Paris hotel is better (and bigger).  I liked the blend of flavors from the meat, but it was hard to separate them out.  The Roma tomatoes added some freshness, but I could have used less of them.  Ditto for the Italian Dressing.  Regardless of anything else, Earl is an especially budget friendly option given its location on the Strip (sandwiches were about $7.00 each).  Plus points as well for being open 24 hours - way better for late night munchies than the 24 cafe at Paris or the bar at Bally's.  For those reasons, I'm rounding up from THREE AND A HALF to four.  Had we actually gone then (drunk) instead of for dinner (sober), I probably would have loved Earl of Sandwich.  Instead, depending on the sandwich I want, I might lean towards JJ Boulangerie instead and save my Earl trips for post drinking/clubbing adventures.",

It came with tuna, Swiss, mayonnaise, and I added lettuce and tomato, as well! This is definitely one of the better tuna melts I've had. I'm glad the tuna did not have that \"fishy\" taste to it and I highly recommend adding the lettuce and tomato to give the sandwich more of a fresh and light taste. The sandwich was around $8 and was very filling. The fact that this place is open 24/7 is a plus because you can literally have a sandwich anytime you want! I highly recommend trying Earl's at least once during your stay in Vegas. It's definitely worth the stop.",

The first time I had their Chipotle Chicken Avacado, and the second time we had the Full Montagu, Original Earl & Chipotle Chicken Avacado.   The concept is pretty simple. All food is ordered to go!  Walk into Miracle Mile via the South Entrance. (Close to Rockbar) Get into the short line into this sandwich place. Place your order at the counter that has a hanging sign \"Order Here\" Pick any chips, cookies etc. and take your receipt to the counter that has a hanging sign \"Pay here\" Pay, and take your buzzer. Fill up drinks etc.  Once the buzzer goes off, pick your food up where the sign \"Pick-Up here\" hangs  There is seating at the restaurant itself where you could hang out and dine, or munch on the sandwich while walking the strip!  Pros: Delicious Sandwich. All the sandwich's I tried were good. (+1) $7.56 with tax on each sandwich. This is a bargain for the taste and the convenience! After devouring endless plates of meals at the buffet's, a sandwich portion of this size is light and refreshing!  Cons: Few of their items are seasonal. Mrs. wanted to try their Caribbean jerk chicken, and I wanted to try their Meatball sandwich. Unfortunately, they were not available. (-1)  I will definitely hit this spot up during my future Vegas trips.",

    "text": "The only sandwich you should be eating from here is The Original!! But honestly, the rest of their sandwiches are just as good I'm sure. I first tried Earl of Sandwich in Downtown Disney and fell in love. When I spotted this location in Planet Hollywood I had to stop by. There was a bit of a line but they have the ordering and paying process down. You tell your order to one person and bring your receipt and pay to the next person. Super quick and the food comes out just as quick. For one sandwich, a side of potato salad and tomato soup, my total was about $15. Now this is a steal in Las Vegas!! In a sea of expensive of food places, there is a glimmer of hope with Earl of Sandwich. Where you can get a delicious and filling meal in under $20.   The Original sandwich is where it's at. Roast beef and horseradish sauce is the best combo. The bread is nice and toasted, doesn't get soggy at all. This sandwich is just so flavorful, it's impossible to not just inhale it. The sides are just as good! The potato salad is a decent size at just a few extra dollars. Same with the tomato soup, it was about $3 for their small. They have a bunch of other options if you're not in the sandwich mood like wraps and salads. But come on... you have to eat a sandwich at Earl of SANDWICH.   I can't express enough how bomb the sandwiches are. If you're in Vegas, stop by here.",

Kind of like over priced food at theme parks and sports arena. Not terrible, just not great either, I don't get why others gave it a 5 star rating I found the food no better than sandwiches from a Quizno or frozen hot pocket.  Interesting that people post pictures of the packaging as much as the food. It's well designed marketing but I'd rather have a real deli with better food wrapped in butcher paper.",

First, you order and then you move to next register to pay. They give you one of those buzzer thing when your food is ready. They're really efficient. It's a sandwich production. There's a whole bunch of people working behind the scene.  But really, their roast beef sandwich is to die for. The buns are toasty, roast beef is soft and juicy with mustard like sauce. Don't expect an array of veggies because it only comes tomatoes unless you order something else.",

It was strange because he was directly behind me in line and when I saw him, I thought, \"What the hell.  Small world.\"  Anyway, the line  moved fast. The decor was cool and from what my friend told me, everything on the menu was delicious.  I was happy since the prices were actually reasonable.  $6-$8 for a sandwich.  I ordered a bacon chicken sandwich.  I can see why this place is so popular.  The service was great, the price is fair, and their sandwiches were so tasty.  They had a bread which looked like cibatta bread and their ingredients seemed fresh.  It came out warm and newly made.  Someone once told me that it was the bread that makes or breaks a sandwich and this was a hit.  The portions filled me up and I got nothing bad to say.  Great all around!",

Because I had something really similar in Korea, and it was better there :[ haha  Convenient to order, easy to customize I guess (if you're picky about condiments and stuff). I had the Earl Club Sandwich; it was so good, typical insides.. I think it was turkey + bacon + condiments. My friends tried the Holiday Turkey Sandwich; it is THANKSGIVING IN YO MOUF. Seriously; turkey, cranberry sauce, gravy. I really like how they slightly toast your buns.. I also wish they could be bigger, but oh well. My girl friends and I ate half before pregaming and ate the 2nd half after clubbing LOL so it was practically like 2 meals! Wow!

    "text": "This is probably the only place (off the top of my head) that really, truly deserves a 5/5. Maybe even a 6.5/5. The business didn't pay me to say that. Although they could pay me in sandwiches... that would be my dream.   To start, I didn't know about the hype at all; I've never even heard of this place until my friends and I stayed at PH so I had no clue that it was kind of a big deal. I came in with an open mind (and a growling stomach) to say the least.   I think what initially attracted me to this place was that its open 24 hours. The fact that I could get food from this place at any point of the day is a big plus, especially since it's Vegas. People tend to lose track of the time from all the booze hounding they do. I kind of did. Anyway, I recall seeing a huge line up during lunch time and I was quite intrigued. I decided to try it and see what it was all about.   My first sandwich was the Full Montagu. Roast beef, turkey, swiss and cheddar, lettuce, tomatoes and this Earl's Mustard sauce. Holy orgasmo in my mouth. Not even joking, it was so delicious. The bread was nicely buttered and toasted, moist meat, crisp lettuce, velvety cheese... and that sauce! Mouthwatering. I think the price helped a whole lot too. I don't remember how much I paid for it exactly but I think it was somewhere around $7 or $8. So worth it.   I was so happy with my initial purchase that I decided to come back the next day and bring my friend along. This time we got the BLT, the Hawaiian and the Tomato Soup. The BLT was a jacked up BLT, not in terms of size but in terms of taste. It was really good. The Hawaiian had a spicy, smoky, sweet taste to it which I really loved. Another home run. But the biggest surprise for me in this round was the Tomato Soup. I have never tried a tomato soup as good as the one I've had there. It was nice and silky and the croutons! Oh my damn those croutons... Wonderfully soaking in the rich tomato goodness. I paid around $10 for the BLT and the soup. It was so worth it; the sandwich and the soup were nice portions and really good.  Would I come back? Hell to the yes. Great food for a great price. So worth trying. I tell any of my friends that are going to Vegas to try this place. That's how impressed I was.",

The bread is really good as is the sauce, meat, and everything else in the sandwiches.  I'd venture to say this was my best meal on this trip, factoring in taste and cost - not bad for a sandwich shop!",

The only downside is that the sandwiches are a bit too short for my liking. However, that may be because I liked it so much and it was gone in 2 minutes. I had to stand in line for another one. :-P.

The only location I know of not exactly in the most ideal spot for me. Thankfully I was going see Def Leppard concert with friends so perfect pre show grubbing.   I ended up going with the Thai Chicken Wrap. I really enjoyed! First impression of dam that nice size wrap and maybe going combo with bag chips/drink might be to much food. It was perfect amount of food at great price. The filling was pretty tasty. The Thai salad dressing was awesome. I could have had bowl of salad by itself! Not only was the greens nice fresh but the chicken was perfect. U get decent amount of chicken in it. Thai chicken wrap would get again.",

I came here late at night and ordered the chipotle chicken avocado and the sandwich was very sweet. Not sure if they mixed up some of the ingredients but it wasn't good.   However, I tried the potato salas which was very good. I would definitely eat it again!",

Took about five minutes to get our food and we were able to find seats easily since it was a Tuesday night. There's mayo, mustard, hot sauce, and steak sauce at every table. Very good to have if you wanna add some condiments to your sandwich. We also had the Mac and cheese. Definitely small in size but shareable between two people. They also have water cups available which is good to hydrate on. Also tons of dessert places around this spot! So go grab some cookie dough!",

Warm, toasted, well put together (not falling apart), fresh ingredients, and the right portions of everything in the sandwich. We waited maybe 10 minutes in line before they took our order at the counter. Service was very friendly and efficient.   I got the Hawaiian BBQ and it was delicious. Just the right amount of sauce and the meat was warm and flavorful. The whole wheat bun I got was perfectly toasted and held everything together nicely. I seriously appreciate a sandwich that doesn't fall apart when I bite into it or get near the end.   Definitely getting the chipotle avocado chicken next time. I tried my friend's and it was bomb.

First of all, their menu is amazing. It ranges from salads, wraps, hot sandwiches, soups, etc.   They're known for the world's best hot sandwiches....indeed they make the world's best hot sandwiches. So I saw it fitting to order the Chicken Bacon Avocado on wheat bread. I came with a party of 7 and waited about 7-10 minutes for our sandwiches and they came perfectly packaged and sealed with a sticker specific to our sandwich (see attached photo).   The sandwich itself was delicious. It was flavorful and the perfect temperature. Everything just leaves a lingering flavor in your mouth-- making you want more. The avocado was fresh and the chicken was perfectly grilled. The sauce that is included in the sandwich a tad spicy, but perfectly bearable.   I even got to try the French dip and that was also delicious. Some other members of my party got the Full Montagu and the Earl's Club and they were also delicious.   This is located inside of the Miles Shops and if you're in need of a quick bite whether in the morning, afternoon, or evening, come check this place out! You won't be disappointed. They also have breakfast options until 11am if you need to grab something before an early flight!",

The chicken tasted like either processed or over marinated chicken to me but what I really didn't care for was the sweet Thai chili sauce and my wrap had tons of it in there. I thought I read something about peanut sauce But either there's not much peanut in it or that sauce was missed?   A-OK at best",

What is even more impressive is that I can get a hot ham and swiss sandwich and a bag of chips for under $10 in Las Vegas. PLUS the sandwich is AMAZING. The sauce they use whatever it is, I wanted more of it and I didn't want my meal to end.   This place is delicious! I noticed they had breakfast so now I'm anxious to try their breakfast next time. Also, they're open 24/7 so this should be super easy to swing by next time.   It's not many places that you can find quality meals for decent prices in vegas the two just don't always mix.   Easy ordering system to - you order at one end of the restaurant the other end you pay then they call your number so not much waiting time I felt like also which was a huge plus!   I noticed they had lots of different cookies, brownies and rice krispy treats offered also.. while I was very tempted I didn't' cave in, maybe next time.",

They advertise The Earl's Club as \"The World's Greatest Hot Sandwich,\" so that's what I ordered.  It came very hot, and it WAS good...but the greatest? Idk about that.

My friend and I needed a quick dinner before the Backstreet Boys concert started at 9, and Earl did the trick! We were in and out of here in 30 minutes.  We came around 8:30 pm on a Saturday and there was barely a line. They're mainly known for their sandwiches, but offer some wraps, pizza bread, and salads as well.   I went with the namesake Earl's Club ($7.49), which has turkey, bacon, Swiss, lettuce, and Roma tomato. It normally comes with some kind of sauce but I opted not to get it as I don't like mustard or mayo. Unfortunately they didn't have pesto to substitute it with. They also had tomato soup available so I got a small cup for $2.99.  Our sandwiches were ready within 10 minutes of ordering. I was a little bit underwhelmed by it though. Maybe if I had gotten the sauce in my sandwich, it would've been better, but it was a bit dry. The sandwich itself was a little bit on the small side, which makes sense given the price, but it was enough to fill my friend and I up.   I actually really enjoyed the tomato soup. They put in chunks of semi-crunchy toasted bread that soaked up the tomato flavor really well.  As I mentioned earlier, we were in and out of here in 30 minutes! It was right around the corner from the concert venue, so we made it to the concert with plenty of time to spare :)",

How do I remember my order??  -1 Portion size: pretty small for a \"full\"...I guess Subway has set my expectations for sandwiches LOL.  +1 Like that the sandwiches were pipin' hot!   We ordered:  1) The full Montagu ($7.49): Everything tasted really fresh, and I liked that the turkey was evenly sliced (the little things). Okay amount of veggies, but overall, wish it had a bit more sauce. 2) Chipotle chicken avocado ($7.49): I liked this one because of the avocado, but the cheese annoyed me because it hardened so quickly (LOL). Liked the addition of bacon!   Overall, would come here again...but I might need like, 3 sandwiches to myself. :D",

Ya, that was my feeling the morning of ordering something from Earl of Sandwich to eat. And I didn't even order a sandwich so honestly this review can't really help someone that is wanted to order a sandwich from here. I ordered the chicken Thai salad with dressing on the side. The lettuce wasn't too special and was basically just iceberg and romaine. I would have preferred a spring mix or spinach.  The chicken was kind of dry and the only other topping on the salad were won tons. How boring, I was thinking the salad would be more colorful but it wasn't. Therefore it was kind of bland and eh boring. oh and the dressing was kind of too thick for my style.   It is located on the edge of the inside of one of the casinos and they focus on sandwiches. I just wasn't in the mood for a sandwich  so I ordered a salad. But, in the end, the salad wasn't good so I would have been better off ordering a salad.   But the service was good and it was quick to order. I definitely would never order a salad from an Earl of Sand-which ever again though. But hey, I do think they can make some of the salads vegan and possibly a veggie sandwich for my vegan pals out there, you probably just need to make sure the bread is vegan.",

    "text": "A reliable sandwich shop! Earl of Sandwich is always consistent in its quality, so I come here often when I am in Vegas.   My favorite sandwich is their Chipotle Chicken Club (grilled chicken, bacon, avocado, and their chipotle mayo--how could you go wrong with that?). I usually order a bowl of their tomato soup as well. Here's the breakdown of all the items we ordered:  Chipotle Chicken Club on wheat - $7.50- my favorite sandwich here. I highly recommend it! Pairs well with the tomato soup. Tomato Soup - $4 - solid. Croutons are good and it tastes amazing with tabasco sauce for a little kick. Berry Chicken Almond Salad - $8 - we liked this salad (everything was fresh), but definitely the dressing is strong. Do not pour the dressing over the salad! Use it in increments or else it will be too much Earl's Club - $7.50 - another solid sandwich. My parents each had a half and shared the salad and they enjoyed their meal Cheese Pizza Bread - $6 - for the unadventurous, it is a solid piece of cheesy bread. If your kid is a picky eater, they will enjoy this. Is it worth $6? To get your kid to eat something, maybe.  Strawberry Yogurt Parfait - $4 -  I liked the berries and the granola, but the yogurt was too sweet. I probably will not order this again.",

Earl's is so accessible that we sometimes even go twice in a weekend. You first give your order at the front and make your way down along the counter. On the way to the cashier you can see the workers preparing the food quickly and efficiently.   In my opinion, the best sandwich is the Chipotle Chicken and I always opt for the wheat bread. They cut the sandwich in half for you so it's easy to share with a friend or save it for later. The bread is usually slightly crispy but soft on the inside. Not too dry because of the chipotle sauce and avocados.   I haven't tried anything else and I always tell myself to get something new but I love the Chicken Chipotle too much to order something else.",

I took their suggestion and ordered me a sandwich. I don't live in Vegas, but every time I'm here, I go and order the same thing -- the TUNA -- its warm, it's toasty, it's delicious.   Most recently, I ordered it after a drunken night, then the next morning I order another for the ride back to San Diego...desperate for sandwiches much? YES.   The line can absolutely get long, so look out - i guess it depends on the time of day, rush hour of lunch/dinner/after club hopping. They are open 24 hours after all (If I recall correctly.)  I've also had the chicken tortilla soup, and it's good! I mean it's sitting there in a pot all day, but it was really good tasting! I kind of had it for breakfast, lol.",

Well I'm not really into sandwiches, but dang, the sandwiches at Earl of Sandwich are amazingly tasty and flavorful and perfectly warmed! Came here on a weekday, mid-afternoon. The line wasn't too bad. You place your order, pay and then they give you a little buzzer to let you know when your order is ready for pick up. We ordered Earl's Club and Hawaiian BBQ, along with sides of regular plain mac n cheese and mac n cheese with bacon. The sandwiches were amazing!!! The mac n cheese with bacon is a must-have. The turkey chili is not worth getting... It's a bit watery in my opinion. BUT, make sure you get a cookie for dessert. They have chocolate chip, oatmeal raisin, sugar and recently added peanut butter. I got an oatmeal raisin cookie and I swear it was the best oatmeal raisin cookie I've ever had. Their banana but muffin is pretty good, too!!Definitely check this place out when you're in Vegas. Totally worth the hype! :)",

I'd say that whatever bread they pick, it's about 6-8 inches long for the subs which makes you long for more.  Which sucks because when you finish, you do feel like you're left with this emptiness inside.  I had a Chipotle Chicken Avocado that was.... WOW.  Like... uhh... WOW.  But the size of it really makes you want a AYCE sandwich shop.  The food is too good to be drunken stupor food, but the size of it doesn't quite qualify the money unless you're accounting for Strip economics.",

Perhaps all the hype and high expectations made me feel like I would be eating a slice of heaven.  I had The Original 1972 and it was delicious. It was a great sandwich for sure but I couldn't really understand what the hype was all about. My theory: People love it because the rest of the food in Vegas is either way too expensive or if it is affordable, then it probably sucks. As other Yelpers have mentioned it was definitely the most affordable and tasty meal in Vegas.   I was also intrigued by their Earl Grey Lemonade but they ran out of it when I was there.  Would I come back again? For sure. It beats paying $20+ for a crappy Vegas buffet!",

Food:  The Original 1762 (<a href=\"http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/DkYS3arLOhA8si5uUEmHOw?select=OXYqiE37XqVBET_wXqWDJg\">yelp.com/biz_photos/DkYS...</a>) - $5.99 I know the picture does not do the sandwiches any justice... but its sooo good. Freshly Roasted Beef, Sharp Cheddar & Creamy Horseradish Sauce. The horseradish gives it a little kick but isn't too spicy. They also add whole mustard seeds which was interesting. The sandwich roll they use makes this sandwich 10 times better! Kind of crispy on the outside and soft on the inside.. not too thick or too thin.  Caprese (<a href=\"http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/DkYS3arLOhA8si5uUEmHOw?select=kbo_2il3g8YPi_LPHmPcpA\">yelp.com/biz_photos/DkYS...</a>) - $5.99 Fresh Mozzarella, Roma Tomatoes, Fresh Basil & Drizzled Balsamic Vinaigrette.

When you are on a Vegas trip with a group of students in their mid-twenties, you will end up at Earl of Sandwich somehow, somewhere.  Located right in the middle of the Miracle Mile shops, this speedy sandwich shop is the cheapest and yummiest meal you will find on the strip.    There are a ton of different sandwiches, salads, soups, and wraps that could fill anyone.  The Full Montague is always a hit with the roast beef and turkey all in one sammie.  I think I have tried over half of the sandwiches on the menu and I haven't been unhappy with any of them.  On a recent visit this past weekend I tried their Holiday Turkey sandwich.  It was delicious.  It had turkey, stuffing, cranberry, and gravy!  It was like Thanksgiving in a sandwich.  So SCRUMMY... I think what makes these sandwiches so good is the toasted bread.  The bread is super good.  Fluffy and crispy at the same time.  I have had multiple friends eat this about 4 times in one weekend.  No joke.  At $6.48 ($5.99 plus tax) per sandwich, this place is a great deal.  Your belly and wallets will be satisfied.  You can go and waste the rest of your money on roulette.",

I was only in Vegas for 2 days and I ate here 3-4 times. It was that good. And the line may be long, but it was totally worth it cuz it moves fairly quickly.  Anyways, so I tried the Earl's Club, Full Montagu, Tuna Melt, and the breakfast one with eggs and ham.. ALL WERE FREAKIN DELICIOUS. I honestly don't think you can go wrong with their menu.. everything is just really good. It may just be a sandwich, but to me, it was like the PERFECT SANDWICH. I think the bread made it extra melt in your mouth good. It's pretty cheap too! $5.99 a sandwich and I believe it's open 24/7!  I tried looking up their locations to see if there were any near my area, but the closest one is Vegas.. sucks! But if you're in Vegas, make that visit over to PH and try Earl of Sandwich! You surely will NOT regret it! =)",

This left only the Caprese sandwich for vegetarians, which I dislike for the huge hunk of cheese.  Then, they added in a new Veggie sandwich that seemed like it was made with just whatever leftover ingredients were available.  I don't even remember what was on it other than stinky cabbage.  But now, the original Mediterranean style Veggie sandwich is back and as delicious as ever! YUM!",

Ordered the Hawaiin BBQ: chicken, ham, pineapple, Bbq sauce. It wasn't particularly big but the flavor was amazing. You don't expect much service from a place like this, but the speed of service was quick and easy. I brought my own water bottle and they accidentally rang me up for it and took it off the check with no issues. Also tried their new bbq chicken flatbread. Also very good. I'm a sucker for a tangy bbq sauce so both items really hit the spot.",

As a poor college student cramming a bajillion people in one hotel room trying to save money during a Vegas trip, this place is ppperrrrfect!  Sandwiches are roughly $6 each here and they have a ridiculous diverse menu. They have two vegetarian options: Caprese & Veggie sandwich. I had both and ended up liking the Caprese more. It was my first time eating Caprese but boy was it AMAZING. Everything was made to perfection from the balsamic vinegar to the bread. And let me point out that this is probably one of the best aspects about this place: the bread. It's crunch and soft and fresh all at once, no complaint heres!  The line is kind of long to order but moves really fast. Because this place is so cheap, it's continuously crowded with 20 something year old kids like me trying to find a decent meal for cheap in Vegas. They also have a plethora of baked goods, fruits, yogurt cups, frozen lemonade, you name it!  Definitely definitely come here if you're in town. It won't disappoint!",

(pre-club, post-club, day after)  It's definitely NOT the \"world's greatest hot sandwich\" but it's tasty, cheap, quick and convenient. Eat here if you don't feel like dropping $50 on buffet and want something better than McDonalds.  I recommend the ORIGINAL 1762 and FULL MONTAGU sandwiches.  --------------  ORIGINAL 1762 - A little skimpy on the meat portions but flavorful throughout the sandwich with just the right amount of horse radish and cheese. (fyi- Meat is not consistent. One of the sandwiches was medium rare and the other was well done).   FULL MONTAGU- Get this if you want veggies and more bang for your buck. Sandwich is about 1/4inch taller than the 1762.  --------------  TIPS:  1. DO NOT go 3 times in 24hours. You'll get sick of it and end up forcing it down or keeping it for later and eating it cold.  2. Visit after the clubs. Plenty of rowdy, drunk entertaining customers.  Highlights include:  A drunk guy trying to fight two other drunk guys because he thought they were taking pictures of his ugly drunk gf, funny drunk pick up lines and lot's of people with food on their shirts.  3. Order a side of macaroni salad and put it inside your 1762.",

My sister had the Club sandwich, and my brother had the Ham and Cheese- and as simple as these items are- I heard a \"wow\" escape from their lips as well.  Their artisan bread is so fresh and that is what makes the difference.   The price is VERY reasonable, and the portions are filling and satiating.  Can't wait to return and try another item from the menu.",

Early morning & most of the shops are closed, but this place is open 24/7.  Breakfast sandwiches, 4 bucks.  So I'm thinking I'll end up with somthing like an egg mcmuffin.  Wrong.  The Ham and Swiss breakfast sandwich on the menu comes with sour cream and some kind of mustard sauce.  I requested mine without the sour cream and mustard, just a little mayo instead.  It came on about a 4 1/2 square foccacia packed with about an inch of finely shaved ham that was oh so delicious.  Outside of the sandwich was lightly crispy and the whole thing tasted like smoky buttery yummmm.  It was so good I had breakfast there on another morning during my stay and brought same sandwich to one of my co-workers.  Highly recommend for frugal & delightful breakfast.",

But then again, my mouth may have been watering so much that I may not have been speaking properly.  Once we all go out sandwiches though-- they became believers. The Earl makes a damn good sandwich.

There's always a line, so don't despair. It moves fairly quickly. I think we were in and out in about 15-20 minutes.  That time gives you the perfect amount of time to read enough reviews to make you think, Tuna Melt? Really!? Of all the delicious meats they have, everyone wants to rave about the Tuna Melt? That must be a damn good tuna melt. And as you wrestle with your manhood, can I still be a man and order a tuna melt? and you wrestle with the 20 minutes of your life you're not going to get back that you stood in line to order a tuna melt, you come to one of two realizations. 1. Ain't nobody got time for that!~ (a la Sweet Brown) or 2. That must be a damn good tuna melt~ (a la Pulp Fiction). I went with the latter and was not disappointed. That was easily the best damn tuna melt I ever had. I highly recommend it.  I'll be back for a tuna melt and something more manly, but it will happen.   My wife got the caprese and she loved it. I had a few bites and it was good, but not great.   GO HERE. EAT. BE HAPPY.",

The montagu was good, but the caribbean jerk chicken really does need some work.  I ordered it since other yelp reviewers recommended it, but something is missing in that sandwich.  There isn't much spice in the sauce, and it needs more than some roasted red peppers and some hot peppers, no?    Line is crazy long, but it goes very quickly and tables open up pretty fast.  Would def come again :)",

For only $5.99 each, it's such a great deal compared to paying $35-$40 for a buffet in vegas with mediocre food.  The line was very short and the employees work similar to a production line where each one had their responsibilities, (bread, meat, toaster, condiments, etc..)  Service was fast!  Ordered the Jerk Chicken sandwich (wasn't as spicy as I thought, but still good), the Tuna Sandwich (lots of cheese! how i like it!), and the Club sandwich.  I took the club sandwich back to the Vdara hotel to eat later since there was a microwave in the room, but one of my friends ate it before I even tried it..lame.   The BREAD is the main component that is making their sandwiches taste so good.  It's perfectly toasted and melts in your mouth.  Since I have a crazy sweet tooth, I bought the chocolate chip cookie and the brownie creme sandwich. The cookie was chewy and had the perfect sized chucked of chocolatechips and the brownie was moist and chocolaty  Both tasted great, no complaints, and I'm highly critical when it comes to desserts!",

It is open 24 hours---how perfect! It's cheap! About $6 for a sandiwich---it might look a little small but it's stuffed with food so it'll be sure to fill you. The line is a bit long, but they go through it pretty quickly...  I got the tuna melt and it was just amazing. Soft bread, chewy, cheesy, warm---everything you'd want in a sandwich!   They give you buzzers to hang out to while your sandwich is being prepared, and there is not much of a wait so you'll get your food fast!  I definitely recommend stopping by here! Amazingly delicious, affordable food...open 24 hours? What are you doing still reading this review? Go!",

All of their sandwiches are great. Didn't have to worry about any peanut allergies. Seating area gets pretty packed for lunch. Food comes out very quickly even though they give you a buzzer. I would probably say wait time from ring up to pick up is about 3 minutes. This is a must try when your in Vegas.",

My two favorites. The Earl's Cobb Salad is a simple salad but still good. Only reason I'm not giving a 5 is cause the fact that half of my food wasn't in the bag and I was about to leave and wasn't aware of it till I checked inside the bag and had to go back. I've always loved coming here for lunch because of the amazing sandwiches. It's a must try when in Vegas!",

Other than that, it's probably one of the most popular attractions in Planet Hollywood other than that \"popstar\" who lip-synchs and half-asses her 'performances'.  It's such a fucking tourist trap and I frequent this place when I'm on break from work. The sandwiches are bomb and since I'm basic, I go for the 'original' often. If you're new to Earl, definitely try the 'original'. To save you from embarrassment or for those of you who have social anxiety, they do NOT have 'footlongs' here.",

If I had to pick, the Montagu would probably be my favorite. The mix of roast beef, cheese, and especially the mustard was a phenomenal combination. The jerk sauce in the Carribean Jerk Chicken was also really great, and took all the bland flavor out of the chicken. Seems like their sandwiches are all about the sauce!  $6 for a quick and delicious lunch is something hard to find on the strip. You might wait in line for a good 20 min, but it's well worth it!",

There is so much hype surrounding this sandwich shop. Between this location and the one at Downtown Disney, I knew I had to check it out. So after checking into our hotel during my birthday weekend in Vegas, we met up with friends to eat here and I was excited. It was lunchtime but the wait in line was reasonable, and gave us time to decide exactly what we wanted.  With so many options to choose from (sandwiches, soups, salads), it was like an elevated version of Subway (with actual Subway prices, not elevated Vegas Subway prices). The sandwiches were good, and the bread was perfectly toasted and flavorful, but I was so disappointed in my cheesesteak sandwich. Couldn't they at least have chopped up the roast beef to be the same consistency as a real cheesesteak? My boyfriend and I split that with an Italian sandwich, which I liked better.   I kept hearing how good the tomato bisque is here, and kicked myself for not ordering that as well to try it out. Looks like a 2nd visit to this establishment is definitely warranted...",

The sauce was just right (i like it slightly drenched) and the meat was perfect, not too much and not too little!! I'm also a BIG BREAD person, and the bread they had was AMAZINGLY CRUNCHY.

The Chicken Bacon Avocado at Safeway is an upgraded version of it in both taste and portion... and you can always just add some spicier sauce if you want a kick. Also tried the Hawaiian BBQ sandwich. Chicken was slightly dry and overall nothing special.  Overall, the portions were small and taste was average. If you compare to Subway, then ya, taste is good... but I've easily had much better sandwiches for the same price.",

I ordered the Chipotle Chicken Avocado (grilled chicken, bacon, sharp cheddar, avocado, lettuce & chipotle sauce), and my sister ordered the Best BLT (bacon, lettuce, tomato & seasoned mayonnaise). We also ordered their Triple Chocolate Brownies and the Earl Grey Lemonade. The brownies were good, but nothing spectacularly unique. The lemonade was kind of tasteless in my opinion. I really, really enjoyed my sandwich though! So did my sister, but I don't think she enjoyed hers to the extent that I did.   I will definitely give this place another visit the next time I'm in Vegas and am in need of a quick, cheap lunch!   If you go on their website and sign up with them, you will receive a coupon for a free sandwich on your birthday!",

    "text": "I'm going from strictly memory of my Earl of Sandwich experience.  My fat Hawaiian friend recommended this spot and after building his creditability with the Pizzeria @ The Cosmopolitan, I gave in.  Earl's is pretty easy to find and is right across from the Sugar Factory.  The sandwich shop was pretty busy, but it could of been the holiday, 4th of July.  The menu is extensive and consists of hot sandwiches, salads & wraps, desserts, breakfast items, and beverages and smoothies.  I opted for a hot sandwich, more specifically the Caribbean Jerk Chicken.  The sandwich is subtle and includes grilled chicken, roasted red & banana peppers, and their signature spicy jerk sauce.  The sandwich was mouth watering delicious.  The chicken was nicely grilled and seasoned.  The lettuce, tomato, and peppers gave it that crunch, and their jerk sauce gave it that kick without overwhelming the overall taste. The food was awesome, but I do suggest ordering a large or two sandwiches, as I was left somewhat unfilled after my regular sized sandwich.  It's no five star sandwich but it's damn close.",

Sandwiches here are STILL FREAKING DELICIOUS!! You know it is gonna be a good sandwich before you even open it from the wrapper. Don't be scared away by the long line.. it moves quickly!   This time around I got the Holiday Sandwich which is (limited time only unfortunately) turkey breast, cranberry sauce, stuffing.... explosion in your mouth pretty much! I'm not a big fan of sweet/salty but the cranberry was not too overpowering. It really complemented the delicious turkey. Speaking of turkey, this is not shitty average tasting turkey you find on the supermarket shelves. Earls' puts a big hefty serving of turkey that is layered very nicely and tastes even yummier.   Highly recommend the creamy tomato soup.. had it again and it was just as good as the first time! Their chicken tortilla soup was just average tasting though.   This time I stayed at Westgate Towers @ Planet Hollywood so Earl of Sandwich is just a quick walk down to the casino... absolutely perfect! They should deliver to the hotel rooms :(",

Anyways since I was starving, I ordered the Jamaican Jerk Chicken sandwich and the Hawaiian BBQ and both did not disappoint.  Their bread is so soft and warm, the chicken is hot and tender, the sauce just exploded in my mouth.  God I want it again and again.  Shh don't turn me in, I know Vegas has a no-tolerance policy, but I stole their Tabasco bottle to make up for my losses at the casino.  Anyhow, great sandwiches at a great price.

Vegas is weird in that while it has its fair share of expensive buffets and chef-driven restaurants, it also has plenty of affordable options. However, too much Chipotle and McDonalds gets old, and I still want to look good in my little dresses! That's where Earl's comes in. As many others have mentioned, it is cheap. It is also insanely delicious. The location is convenient, and no matter what you order you will be satisfied.  The breakfast sandwiches are awesome too, the perfect cure for the common Vegas hangover. I always grab one before heading to the airport. Does the trick.  I can't wait for my next trip to Vegas.

Turkey, roast beef, ham maybe?, mustard aioli, and all the fixins... love it!!  And with all the price hikes now a days, can't beat a 7$ sandwich made to last all night. And if it doesn't, it's open 24 hours now!",

And of course, because I'm a masochist and a lemming, I ordered the original 1872 roast beef sandwich at Earl of Sandwich, expecting to lump it into the same category as every other roast beef sandwich.  But it was good. REALLY good. It made me feel silly for being so obstinate about roast beef sandwiches. Had I really been missing out this entire time? The bread was freshly baked and the perfect receptacle for the simple sandwich: tender, thin slices of juicy roast beef, melted cheese, and sharp horseradish.   On the side, I had a cup of the best tomato soup I've had in recent memory. Creamy, slightly acidic, and with a sprinkling of really good croutons, presumably made from the same tasty bread as the sandwiches.  I'm not going to start ordering roast beef sandwiches, but I will make it a point to stop by Earl's of Sandwiches every time I'm in Vegas.",

    "text": "As I am writing this, \"Earl of Sandwich\" has 1186 reviews and 4.5 stars for a rating. The short of it is the rating is TOTALLY deserved. It is not 5 star in my eyes because there are no pastrami, corned beef or Rubin offerings (a fact that the order taker knew all too well) and so I can't in all good conscious give it that  1/2 star. But boy howdy, they know how to make a sandwich.  I had the \"Full Montague\" and my wife the \"Club Sandwich\". Both were done just right with tasty sauces on bread that could stand up to the True test of a sandwich, which is, can you eat it holding it in one hand with poker cards in the other hand? This means the sandwich is stacked right, pressed correctly, not too moist to soggy out the bun, does not dribble parts of it down your shirt and most importantly not fall apart. If it meets those criteria AND tastes fantastic you got yourself a winning sandwich. And at \"Earl of Sandwich\" you got yourself a winning sandwich.  I am not going to go into more details; the other 1186 reviews will state more than I can ever write. But I will say this: I am a Vegas Local which means I normally do not head into the casino for a sandwich, it is just too much of a hassle, but that may change now that I have tasted the goodness of \"Earl of Sandwich\", and I don't know of any better recommendation.  \"Earl of Sandwich\" people, if you are reading this, open up one of these in North Las Vegas. I will drive to it; I will eat there... OFTEN. Please please please open one nearby. Amen!",

Funny story:  One weekend, per request of my close friend, we went there Friday, Saturday, Sunday night for dinner.  She ordered the Thanksgiving Holiday sandwich all 3 nights.  She LOVED everything (except she's not a cranberry sauce fan) about it, but .... safe to say, she avoided Earl's like the plague for an entire year.  Finally.... went back and had it again. It's like love again.",

While I wasn't fully blown away by the two sandwiches I tried (I ordered The Original and my gf got the Full Montague), they were still great sandwiches. I blame it on the fact that I  was eating them stone cold sober and not at 3am after a night of sweaty gyrating and fist pumping on the dance floor.   Price-wise this is as good as it gets on The Strip. It was about $6 for a 6 in. sandwich - very worth it. Also, open 24 hrs so come one come all at all hours of the day or night.   Menu is fairly extensive with soups, salads, and desserts as well so you have a great many option to choose from in your drunken stupor.   Definitely make a stop here on your next trip :-)",

I'm grazing on kettle chips and sipping warm beer waiting for my group to come back from a \"short trip to the casino\" so I decide to Yelp real quick.   Here's the quick outline of my experience:  1. Where's the pastrami and corned beef sandwiches? 2. Presentation was cool - I liked the nice little sandwich bricks wrapped like little gifts.  I wanted to build a retaining wall with them.  3. The Original's creamy horseradish was weak and needs more kick.  Too much cream, not enough horseradish.  4. The Montagu was my favorite but it left me not quite satisfied portion wise.  I had to order another sandwich (The Original).  As a side note, I did enjoy reading the origins of the sandwich from the wall in the dining area.  5. Roast beef was tender but bloody (that's ok with me).  The amount of roast beef in the sandwich was lacking a few ounces. 6. Kettle cooked chips were crisp and the pieces were whole and not crushed.   7. Orders were filled fast and exceeded my waiting time expectations.  8. There were no fresh pickles and chiles (I know it's not a deli...but it would be a nice extra). 9. The sandwiches are warm, not \"hot\" as their slogan says. 10. Holiday turkey sandwich was not fresh carved turkey (a la Capriottis).  I made a special trip to try EoS but in the future I will eat here only if I happen to be in the area.  It was good but overrated.",

There's a lot of history behind this franchise..250 years to be exact so they must be doing something right ?! Uhh..right ?? Unfortunately, my experience wasn't quite enticing or memorable.  Earl of Sandwich is like Subway - As in, you place a sandwich shop all by its' lonesome away from potential competition and not many food options available and you'll get hoards of people to come in. Smart Earl. Real smart. Due to its' Vegas location (i.e., inside Planet Hollywood), I'm not surprised many people line up here. This is an easy 'grab n go' meal-type setting and when in Viva Las Vegas, sometimes you just want a quick fix while you go around galavanting Sin City.    Okay..so on to my food:  How can you mess up Tuna salad right ? Well, you sure can in this case. Waaaay overdressed and it reminded me of 'cafeteria food' where the ladies in aprons and hair nets use those hand scoopers to pile on a ball of coleslaw or mash potato on you cafeteria tray. Ya..I got a tuna ball *insert imagination* ! I should have known better, but I was really craving a salad. Is this premade? I could have sworn I saw some tossing up front. Oh..and I hate when they dress the salad for you. I like it on the side. I should have asked prior, but everyone seemed to be in a rush to order and move out the way. So I grabbed my salad and herbal hot green tea and went on my merry way.  Rating Scale from 1-5:  Appearance: Ball of Tuna = 1   Taste: Mushy, overdressed, still edible = 2 Originality: If cafeteria food is original, then I MUST be from another planet = -1  Overall score: 2 stars because I enjoyed my herbal hot green tea and the salad wasn't that expensive (thank goodness !)  So maybe I should have gotten a damn sandwich, but I wasn't feelin' it at the time and my gfs weren't that impressed by it either. Would I give this place another shot ? If I had no other choice, maybe. Ok yes. No maybe. Ha !",

Jamaican Jerk Chicken-sweet, tangy, spicy Chipotle chicken-smokey, tangy, and flavorful The Original-juicy roast beef with horseradish sauce and cheese chocolate brownie-gooey, chocolatey, and crispy. very tasty.

Located in Planet Hollywood Mall area, Earl stands out. Earl has a variety of sandwiches. Earl is affordable. Sandwiches range around $7-8 with tax. Soda fountain for those who crave sugar and diabetes, and free H2O.   Earl and I get a long quite well. I loved the Tuna Melt -- t'is my favorite sandwich. Bread crisp on the outside soft in the inside, great bite and texture. Cannot tell whether or not the tuna is canned, because there are actual chunks of tuna with a generous serving of mayo. The melting cheese is perfect, no complaints. It is a great option for lunch if you don't want to break your wallet at the buffets or expensive tourist prices at other venues. Definitely a must if you are in Vegas. Tip: It is at the east end of the mall, across the casino (so you don't have to walk in big circle). My friends enjoy this so much, they even pack it back to California. But I hear they opened one down in Anaheim by downtown Disney. Come to the Bay Area! plz!!",

After walking over and looking at the menu, I couldn't decide what to order. After watching the wonderful show of KA, it was a bit late and at this point, we were getting a little hungry.  After reviewing the menu, I had decided that we would share a Chicken tortilla soup and I would have the Cannonballs! sandwich, while Bunny got the Earl's Club. The seating area was a little busy, but that's how Vegas life is, always a crowd no matter what time of the day it is, especially for places open 24 hours, like Earl of Sandwich!   Some would like to go out all and have a big fancy dinner before heading home, but we just wanted to relax and enjoy ourselves so we took it back to our hotel room. My only concern would be our food would be cold.  First thing we tried was the soup, which after taking a sip, I didn't want to share with Bunny :D.  There was a lot of flavor and the spice was not too much for me to handle. The container kept it warm. I wouldn't have minded a few crackers, but hey I'm not complaining. All in all, the soup was good.  On to the main course! Basically the Cannonballs! was a meatball sandwich, along with marina sauce and cheese. I was very happy with my choice!  The meat was nice and fresh and had a lot of flavor in it. There was a perfect amount of sauce and it was not overdone.  I had tried a little bit of Bunny's Earl Club. I'm not a big fan of club sandwiches, but after having a bit, I completed converted. It had just the right amount of all the ingredients and when mixed together, it was great.   Next time we are in Vegas, we will definitely come back!",

The boyfriend got the Chicken Avocado Chipotle. That was good too. Not that I got more then a little bite, He hoarded the sandwich with his life.  So in conclusion. Through the drunk days and nights if you want a delicious sandwich at a affordable price, go to Earls :D",

I think if you are caribbean jerk, you need some spice and kick. Maybe they are catering to the common folk, but I was disappointed. It was chicken, and bell peppers,... that's it. I'd come back because the price, but I'd try a different sandwich.",

Dont matter what time of day it is, we all know Vegas never sleeps. Neither does Earl of Sandwich since it is opened 24 hours. You get to see some interesting drunks at 3am in the morning.   All these different sandwiches to choose from made when you order it so its all nice and hot.   I had the Caribbean Jerk Chicken Sandwich and the gf got the Earls Club.   Lets just say after a night of drinking, the sandwich hits the spot in all angles.  Instant fan.",

I haven't been to Las Vegas since 2011 but I'd definitely come back when I visit LV again. I like their Earl's Club and Full Montagu, the other options doesn't interest me and maybe I'll different more sandwiches when I get a chance.

Though the line can be long, Earl of Sandwich has come up with a pretty efficient way of handling their crowds. As for the sandwiches themselves, the ingredients they use are fresh and the meats are moist. The only thing I wish they had was more of a variety of sandwiches to choose from.   I ordered the Original 1762, the roast beef was delicious and moist. And the horseradish sauce wasn't super strong but a good ratio of creamy to spicy. I also went a second time and got the Full Montagu. I'm a condiment person and the mustard wasn't cutting it, so I added more dijon mustard and tabasco. Out of the two, I enjoyed the Original 1762 the best.",

One of the female attendants raised her hand to my face, at which I took to be aggressive, so I swatted her hand away.  Lo and behold, the security was called, whom told us very politely it was in our best interest to leave due to the employee lady's tantrum.  OK.

Here, they don't just serve the average Subway/Quizno sandwiches but THE WORLDS GREATEST HOT SANDWICHES. Yes, it is not just the pompous advertisement, it is actually really good. Each sandwich is prepared with artisan bread that is made by hand and freshly baked-to-order through a conveyor oven. Then at the end, the staff will put in the fillings, wrap it up, and put a sticker on it. The bread is piping hot and the filling is holy delicious. They have an extensive menu, so not only do they sell hot sandwiches, they also have a variety of wraps, soups, hand-tossed salad, and cupcakes. We got two of their signature hot sandwiches. The first one was Cannonballs for $6.99 with meatballs, mozzarella, Parmesan & marinara sauce. The meatball was so tender and flavorful. My friend got the Chipotle Chicken Avocado for $6.99 with grilled chicken, bacon, sharp cheddar, avocado, lettuce, and chipotle sauce. This one was yummy not as good as the meatball sandwich in my opinion.  Long line even at 1 am, but quick service!",

Had there been other 24-hour options in PH, I likely would not have gone back a second time, but at 4:30 in the morning this is the only place you can get food in the hotel (and after 6 hours of stilettos, there was no way anyone was dragging me outside). Probably the best thing about this place is that it's priced reasonably for a well-established Vegas eatery (and certainly more reasonably than the $20 room service wrap).  On my first visit, I tried the chicken caesar wrap, and it was average. There was a ton of lettuce compared to everything else that was on the wrap, and the tortilla was on the stiff side. Overall it was just okay, but out of 5 girls only a couple enjoyed their sandwiches. On my second early-morning visit I got the caprese sandwich, which Earl's was kind enough to customize for me, but in general I left relatively unimpressed.  Next time, I will stick with leftover P.F. Chang's after a big night out!",

The long line is a bit intimidating but it just goes to show how good the sandwiches are.  Additionally, the line does move fast, your sandwich will be made quickly, and there's definitely enough seating available regardless of all the customers.    They also have breakfast sandwiches, salads, parfaits, frozen lemonade, and sweets that look delicious.  I hope try more of their menu items next time which I'm sure will be just as good as their sandwiches!",

    "text": "Ahh Earl of Sandwich...you are my favorite quick bite when I'm in Vegas!  It's 24 hours located in the Planet Hollywood hotel so anytime you need a snack Earl is there for you.  I do recall after coming here from a club all I wanted was a breakfast sandwich...and sadly was informed that they didn't start breakfast till 5am?!  Thats why they lost a star in my book.  I've had several different sandwiches and have yet to be disappointed.  The All American and the Earl's Club are two of my favorites.  For breakfast I stick to the staple, ham egg and cheese...fabulous!    One tip my friend and I have learned is splitting a sandwich is a good idea if just looking for a quick snack before the bars.  The lines can be pretty intimidating but they always seem to move at a good pace.  Someone should open a franchise in Chicago...I bet it would do quite well here!",

The location is very nice too since it's so close to Planet Hollywood and other hotels/casinos in the strip. Another good point about this place is that they serve coffee and breakfast (the breakfast is only till 11:00 though).",

    "text": "This was such a great find during my Las Vegas trip over the weekend.  Located in Planet Hollywood, the lines were long during lunch but it moved quickly.  The ordering process is quick and painless and finding a seat can be a tad bit hard during their peak hours but never impossible.   We ordered the All American sandwich, Full Montagu, Chicken Wrap, and the Berry Salad.    The All American Sandwich was absolutely delicious and flavorful with roast turkey, cheddar cheese, lettuce, tomatoes, and cranberries.  The bread was perfectly toasted and the cranberry added an extra sweetness to the sandwich which made it a little bit more heavenly.   Please order this during your first time here.   The Full Montagu sandwich was good but not great.  Consisted of beef, turkey, cheddar cheese, tomatoes, lettuce, and mustard sauce.   The meat was a bit under-seasoned and the whole sandwich tasted a tad bit bland and light.  The Chicken, Berry, and Almond salad was good.  The whole combination of almond, berry, chicken, and lettuce was good.  The vinaigrette that comes with it was also decent and I would probably order it again if I needed a side of salad to balance out my meal.   This place definitely does not specialize in salad nor wraps so I would stick with the hot sandwiches when I come back.  This is an order-and-find-your-own-seat type of place so don't expect quality service... but DO expect great sandwiches.",

I came here so many time in one trip to vegas and I left saying \"NO MORE EARL\" but now i'm already craving it!  super convenient if you're living in PH and if you don't want to blow more money on another expensive meal in vegas.  1. chipotle chicken avocado- soooo good! chicken a little dry but the sauce was amazing! wish there was more avocado! they be skimpin  2. avocado BLT - TOO MUCH BACON  and too little guac 3. Pastrami- MMM i would say this is my favorite! warm but wish they had more sauerkraut. but i aint complaining because this place is delicious!  i would say, pass on the coleslaw and potato salad.. definitely not good!",

What you should expect is...a flavor packed sandwich that is both fresh and delicious. If you're coming in hungry, do yourself a favor and order two whole sandwiches.  IMO, the Original beats out the Montagu, as you just can't beat a sandwich that is packed entirely of roast beef. The Tuna Melt is quite possibly the best tuna sandwich I've had so far. It's jammed full of hearty tuna salad, two slices of Swiss, and glorious mayonnaise. The Chipotle Chicken Avocado is a decent alternative for those seeking a more a classic combination, but definitely does not compete with the aforementioned sandwiches.  Overall, an excellent 24/7 sandwich shop that does a job well done!",

    "text": "Earl of Sandwich has never disappointed me. I've been here countless times, and tried just about the entire menu including the to-go desserts and drinks. On this last Vegas trip, I was willing to tip the valet several bucks to leave the car out by the curb, just so I could run inside the casino and buy $30 worth of sandwiches.   Everyone knows their bread is one of the keys to their success. Lightly toasted on the outside, yet incredibly soft and fluffy on the inside. The quality of the ingredients on the inside is top notch. Then there's the packaging -- it looks like hot, gold brick, and it feels solid in your hands. As the cliche goes, it's worth it's wait in gold.  A few other tidbits -- I'm a fan of the bacon that they use in their sandwiches. If you love bacon, just find a sandwich with bacon. It's crispy and has just enough saltiness to balance everything out. Don't forget about the meatball sandwich, aka the \"Cannonball.\" The meatball is juicy, and the bread soaks up all the flavors.  If you're pressed for time in the morning, don't forget about their breakfast sandwiches. They put any other breakfast sandwich to shame. Parched after walking a block on the Strip in 110 degree weather, but don't want to spend a ton on those overpriced, alcoholic slushy drinks in phallic containers? Try the frozen lemonade here. It's refreshing, it's $3, and will send you into a spinning brain freeze in no time.",

It goes fairly quick though and the staff are fairly efficient.  Sometimes there is even someone walking through the line who will hand you a menu so you can decide before you make it up to the counter.  Also, they give you a buzzer to notify you once your order is ready.  They have typical beverages including sodas, juices and even gatorade.  They also sell beer by the bottle.  Additionally, they have about 3-4 soups available per day.  Salads too.  Plenty of seating as people are pretty much in and out.",

The first sandwich I ever ate here was the club, and to date, it is the ONLY sandwich I have had here. LOL I have no idea how good the others taste from first hand knowledge. And yes, maybe I am missing out. But I love this sandwich so much, I will not switch up. Earl's is open all day and is busy at standard lunch and dinner hours. But on weekend nights (mornings) after clubbing, you could be waiting in a VERY long line. But even this can be a social event.    The pricing is good for a sub shop and the food is tasty. You will have to order and pay first, and then most likely wait about 10 minutes before you get your food. Sometimes it can be longer. This will seem like a lifetime if you are going after a night of drinking and clubbing, but make the most of it rookie because its going to taste great. And if you are not a rookie, you know what I mean.   Bottom line, Earl's rules and I hope it stays in Vegas forever.",

    "text": "WOW! This place has over 3000 reviews and it's no wonder! Probably the most affordable but delicious food you can find in Vegas. Honestly, there really isn't great food in Vegas if you're not willing to throw down the plastic and pay for an expensive af meal. But Earl of Sandwich makes delicious hot sandwiches that made my college budget sooooo happy!   I had the BBQ chicken sandwich and omg heavenly. Heavenly bc I was starving after my flight, checking into the hotel, walking, being lightweight drunk on the strip from those Fat Tuesdays, etc. You see where I'm going with this...   Make a stop at Earl's for sure! Decently priced, quality hot sandwiches.",

    "text": "Summary: Pretty solid sandwiches for a pretty good price.  Great bread.  Quality ingredients.  Fast assembly.  An excellent choice for a good meal for just one $.  I had just arrived in town with a friend for 2013 CES and we wanted to grab some late dinner on a Wednesday.  We made reservations for Mesa Grill the next night, so to balance that out we wanted to eat on the cheap.  We Yelped and came across The Earl of Sandwich and made our way down the strip.  If you come into Planet Hollywood from the strip, you basically have to walk straight back a ways and keep to your left.  It is part of the food court.  If there is a line, it moves pretty quickly because they just take your order, you choose your drinks, and then you pay and take a number.  When your food is ready, you go and pick it up to the right of the cash register, and there is plenty of dining space for everybody.  On this visit I got the Jerk Chicken sandwich while my buddy got a Chipotle Avocado Chicken sandwich, and then we split a Spicy Italian.  Each of us enjoyed the quality of the ingredients and the way they all worked together between two perfect pieces of bread.  All sandwiches were very flavorful, nice and toasty, and pretty economically priced at around $6 each.  Is it the same price to quantity ratio as Subway? No. But it is a better quality experience for just a little more.  I'd defintiely recommend a visit to the Earl.",

    "text": "I'm actually quite surprised that I never wrote a review for this place.  Okay.. well here goes. My friends are going to hate me for this, but I just have to say it. Earl of Sandwich is good, but it is definitely not amazing or 5 star worthy. I'm SORRY!!  Since it opened, I've probably been here numerous times. And i must say, it's pretty much a staple in all of my Vegas visits. Why then, do I only give it 3 stars? Well.. personally I think the sandwiches are good here but it's not the best sandwich i've ever had in my life...   For a meal at the wee hours of the night, a nice pipping hot, cheesy, melty, carb heavy, meaty sandwich is probably the only thing that will make your night of debauchery even better.  With that said, yes, if you haven't tried Earls, you must do so. You just must.. for the experience, for the claim that you've tried it, and for your own judgment. You must wait the in the atrocious line (which really isn't that bad) and judge for yourself if this place is up to the hype.  The sandwiches are good a size, they don't skimp on the meat, and the ingredients are simple and straight to the point. Also for around $6, it's one of the better deals on the strip that won't go breaking your bank.  Anyhow, if you must try it.. go for the Full Montagu. For a first timer, that is the best choice. But do be warned, their sandwiches are greasy! So be prepared...and the bread is pretty thick, so half the sandwich will probably fill you up.  Nonetheless, personally, I only come here because my friends are in LOVE with Earls and will not stand a trip without a visit. So, for the culture, for the fun, and for the love of late night drunken grub, here's 3 stars.",

Always a clutch place to go when you're just craving  that special something.  Of course it can get crazy during the peak hours, but it's well worth the wait. Also they have sandwich making efficiency DOWN, so you get your order pretty fast. The Full Montagu is just a perfect combination of meats. The Earl's Club comes in a close second just because it has bacon.  Enjoy the only thing in Vegas that isn't marked up 5x the regular price.",

I sat for 30 minutes and thought the wait was normal since the place was so popular...but then I checked. My order had been ready for like 20 minutes and my chicken tortilla soup was cold! They had forgotten to buzz me and nobody thought to call out the order while it was hot. In the end, they comped my whole meal and tossed in some free mini muffins.  Besides the pager fiasco, the sandwich was thoroughly enjoyable. I had The Earl's Club and it was quite a nicely assembled sandwich. Plus, it was pretty affordable! While I didn't get the chicken tortilla soup as I originally ordered, I got cheddar broccoli soup as a replacement. That was pretty enjoyable too.   I'd definitely come back...but I'll remember to keep a close eye on my order next time.",

The jerk chicken sandwich had some sweetness to it due to the jerk sauce and the roasted red peppers. It wasn't spicy. I was actually surprised with the Original sandwich. I'm not usually a fan of roast beef with horseradish sauce, but the flavors worked well. The horseradish wasn't overpowering.  The sandwiches were $5-$6, so it is definitely a cheap eats.",

I ordered the Italian (Salami, Capicola, Ham, Mortadella) and my gf ordered the Full Montagu (Roasted Beef, Turkey, Swiss & Cheddar Cheese). I enjoyed the Italian a lot. Most places that have a generic \"Italian\" sub, sandwich, salad or etc usually tastes pretty bland, but it was definitely one of the best Italian sandwiches I have had in a long time. The Full Montagu was pretty good too, but that Italian was a lot better in my opinion. The sandwich sizes are a little on the small side for my taste but the price was pretty good. 2 sandwiches and 2 drinks was about $20. You would be hard pressed to find a lunch for 2 in Vegas for $20.  After a night of drinking, this place really hit the spot. The quality of food to price ratio was dead on. A 5... out of 5.",

To my surprise, it was the best tuna melt i have ever had. There wasn't too much cheese that it overpowered the sandwich; i could taste the tuna and it was light and flavorful, which was a new experience for me; and the best part was the bread - delicious, the right texture, and enhanced the greatness of this sandwich overall.  In Vegas, I know I'm gonna spend  and lose a lot of money because i'm a terrible gambler since slot machines are so hypnotizing and i'm the unluckiest person you would ever meet, so this sandwich helped me stay fed in Vegas - its very affordable, especially by Las Vegas standards. I came here for multiple meals because of that and it was close by to the Paris, which is where i was staying (it's in Planet Hollywood.)  If you gotta eat, but you wanna save as much money as you can for the tables, come here for a quick bite.  5 stars!!",

It gets 4 stars simply because of  the price, considering its in Vegas. $6 for a sandwich of this quality is probably one of the best deals you can get on the strip.   I've had The Original, Carribean Jerk Chicken, Hawaiian BBQ, and Ham N Swiss. The Original is definitely the standout of the bunch, a standard warm roast beef sandwhich with cheese and horseradish on good bread. I think people tend to hype this place up because they havent had this type of sandwhich before, but if you have its really not that special. All the other ones were just okay. Best part about this place was that it was open at 6am on a Saturday morning!   Go here for a quick, cheap lunch/breakfast if youre near planet hollywood so you can save your money later for Buffet/Fine dining.

I and my friends ordered original, full mantagu, tuna and earl's club. Their bread was chewy and tender.  full mantagu and original has juicy roast beef and tuna was also good flavor. Only the earl's club tasted like ordinary sandwich.  Everything was really good though.  If you like horseradish sauce, you have to ask extra horseradish sauce at cashier for no charge.  It will make your taste bud happy for sure.    Located in Planet Hollywood. (our group walked about 15 min to try only this place and it was worth it.)  Service is friendly.",

    "text": "A Few Tips before going to Earl's  1. Go to the Miracle Mile Information Booth and ask for a Coupon Book. Inside you will find a 10% OFF coupon (entire purchase). If they asked how did you hear about the coupon, let them know you heard it from Southwest.  2. Lines could get long after 12 p.m, but they're very efficient and they move insanely fast. Open 24hrs.  Here is how I would rank the 5 sandwiches I tried:  1. The Earl's Club - Simply Delicious 4.5 / 5 Stars  2. The Full Montagu - 4.25 / 5 Stars  3. Tuna Melt - 4.25 / 5 Stars  4. The Original - 4 / 5 Stars  5. Caribbean Jerk Chicken - 4 / 5 Stars  You really can't go wrong with any of these sandwiches I tried. Like many reviews, I think the bread here is amazing! Earl's of Sandwich is affordable @ $5.99 a sandwich and they are absolutely delicious. If you like Horseradish or the taste of Hot Mustard, the Original may be the one for you. I highly advise people to split their sandwiches with their friends, just so one can try a variety of sandwiches.   Tomato Soup - 3 / 5 Stars Chicken Noodle Soup - 2.5 / 5 Stars",

Its a sandwich with toasted bread, warm meats freshly cooked, melted cheese and lets not forget some cool vegetables! I was having some serious hunger munchies (NO I DON'T SMOKE WEED) that day and this sandwich more than satisfied!

During my recent trip to Vegas with my boyfriend we decided to come here for a midnight snack after running around the strip b/c friends recommended to me.   When we got there we saw that prices were reasonable with each one sandwich costing 5.99$. We decided to share the Hawaiian bbq sandwich (ham,chicken, pineapple, and bbq sauce) because it sounded interesting. This sandwich was amazing. It was like nothing like we've ever tasted.   The next day for breakfast we decided to come back because there were a couple other things we wanted to try. This time we shared the best blt and it was also good. Not amazing but pretty good. Their bread is so crispy and nice so was the bacon so that was a plus.   Seriously, if you want to save some money, eat here. It's worth the 6$ Also its 24 hrs now, so it's a great place to get hangover food!",

I had half the meatball sandwich and the chicken jerk.  I did not like the chicken jerk because the sauce was a little creamy and flavorless.  There was supposed to be peppers to add to the flavor but it was so sparse that you couldn't tell there were peppers in the sandwich.    The meatball sub was better.  The meatball was big but not dry.  There was just enough sauce so the sandwich wasn't dry.    The Montague was actually very good.  I had it w/o cheese and it was still very flavorful. The bacon strips added a nice crisp to the meaty sandwich.    Not bad for a sandwich place for lunch but not a must have for me.",

Its a pretty amazing sandwich but i tried my friend's Chipotle Chicken Avocado and i like that even better! They dont skimp on anything either.

Each sandwich can fill me up with only half so saving the rest for later is a good idea too (:   only downside is how small the little cafe is. There is barely any places to sit and eat. and i wish they opened up and other register. The line is ridiculous... But it goes by alright -- no fast, but not slow either. But then again you could probably try out the casino while a diligent but great friend waits in line for you hahaha",

My go to sandwich would be the tuna melt. The simplicity of it makes it a really enjoyable sandwich. Every sandwich I order from earls is made with such soft and good quality bread. The top is crisp and crunchy while the inside is soft and fluffy.   For their baked goods I've had the brownie and sugar cookie. I like them because they are soft and not overly sweetened. The brownie has mini chocolate chips in it giving it multiple textures.   In short, if you haven't gone to earls go to earls. There's something for your whole group to eat.",

I decided to try something new and ordered the chipotle chicken this trip and it was whatever. This is a good place to stop and get a quick meal before going out when you're in Vegas. Solid 4 stars for the holiday turkey, one star off for the 45 minute line.  ****IMPORTANT NOTE****  My recommendation is to go to the OTHER EARLS LOCATION on the strip, as the line at this one is RIDICULOUS. That one is WAYYYY less busy since most people don't know it exists",

I was so hungry that I ate that sandwich super fast.  I didn't think it was that extraordinary.  I've had better sandwiches.  I felt like for the price I was paying there should have been more stuff in it.  It was a bit too plain for me.  I wish it had more veggies or something it in.  I felt like the sandwich was incomplete.    I would come back if I needed to grab something fast to eat.  I rather grab something else that Vegas has to offer.  Try it if you never had it though!

A very tasty sandwich, but a sandwich nonetheless.  It didn't do magic tricks, light up when I touched it, or change my life.  Still, I was reasonably impressed, especially with the efficiency and politeness of the staff.  It also has a nice seating area in the corner of the Planet Hollywood Casino.    I had the avocado chicken sub.  It was really good-- kind of like a glorified subway sandwich, with slightly better taste and better quality ingredients.  The chicken still kind of had that rubbery, cheap texture to it, but it was still better than at most sandwich places like this i.e. edible.  The chipotle sauce on the sub was delicious.  I also had pasta salad, a cookie, and a soda.  The pasta salad was good, but nothing special.  Loved the cookie!  All of this food was for under $15 and I didn't even finish it all.  Definitely one of the best meals you can get in Vegas for an affordable price, but that's about it.  Don't expect miracles, but your wallet and your belly will still thank you.",

So far we've only tried the Full Montagu and the Italian sandwiches. For the size it's the same as Subway but for the quality, it is worth paying a couple bucks more for the amazing flavor combinations and the fact that eating only one sandwich fills you up.

The one True gem for a great meal at a cheap price (not those $1.99 Steak/Egg deals) is The Grand Lux Cafe tucked away in the Venetian hotel. If you happen to be on the southside of the The Strip I have a new 24 hour dine spot inside the ph.   I went through an Earl's Club and a Cannonballs! sandwich during this trip in Vegas. If your on a budget this is your stop on the south Strip OR if you just want a great deal on some amazing food. Two people can dine for less than $20 but the line during peak \"dining\" hours can get a little outrageous so try to target some off peak visiting.   This is the most western location of the chain sandwich shop with most locations located in Texas or Florida. They really nail the hot sandwich and go far above/beyond a Subway type bite. Just inside the doors of Planet Hollywood Casino/Miracle Mile Shops (if your in the casino head to the southern most facing part of the casino (away from Paris and towards the MGM) and you will find this place and be delighted.   The Strip is full of gimmicks and garbage which we all know but this place puts the crappy buffets to shame with a cheap price and fulfilling meal.",

The cashier replied no to both items which shocked me.  How can you not serve guac?  After plowing through the sandwiches I learned why.  An \"Earl of Sandwich\" is a science.  It has the perfect meat to bread ratio and everything just fits together.  It's best to just eat the sandwich as Master Ear intended it to be.  The bread is to die for.     It was so good we went 2 nights in a row and best of all it's late night.  I love how the sandwhich is packaged with the seal of approval sticker.    I thought the Hawaiian BBQ was  a little on the sweet side.  Enjoyed the Caribbean Jerk, Best BLT, Cannonballs, and All American.  Will try the Tuna Melt next time.  Yes I ate 5 sandwiches in 2 sittings - Don't hate.",

I also had a sandwich for my bf which came the first time my buzzer went off but no salad. That's when I noticed that the little boy who took our order rang up a Thai salad, not that it mattered because it wasn't with the order anyway. I wait patiently for the kid who threw my order at me to come back to tell him I also ordered a salad and that I wanted the BBQ chicken not the Thai like it said on the receipt. Lol and behold several minutes later what do I get? A Thai chicken salad with the chicken on the side. I ate it only because I was starving and it was below mediocre and so small! I'm definitely not happy with their service especially with the long wait time. Never coming back.",

As for the sandwich, The Full Montague was pretty badass.Roast beef, turkey, Swiss& Cheedar cheese, lettuce, tomatoes and mustard being hugged by artisan bread.My only complaint is that it's a pretty thick sandwich and the bread does fill you up fast.Ended up eating only half and I think i left the other half in the glove compartment.I see why people are crazy about this place, but there's still something I can't quite put my finger on that's keeping me from giving it a higher rating.Maybe another visit will clarify things for me.",

The Full Montagu came out HOT and delicious, and I struggled to eat as much of it as the alcohol battlefield of my stomach would allow.  The bread is the top feature of their sandwiches. It reminds me of a biscuit. A KFC biscuit. In a good way. Toasty outside and soft biscuity inside. It makes it easy to bite clean through the sandwiches... a + for sloppy drunks  The sandwiches also have a lot of sauce, which makes everything moist and flavorful and melds everything together. Nothing makes me rage like a dry sandwich.  The Earl's Grey Lemonade was delicious as well. Line moves fast, and food comes out faster!",

    "text": "I have heard so many friends rave about Earls that I feel like I've been here a thousand times.  Finally I can put an end to all the \"you've got to try Earl's\" and \"you've never been to Earl's?\" and \"dude, Earl's is amazing\" because I ate at Earl's!!!  Is everyone quite satisfied now?  This Earl's is in the Planet Hollywood Casino which attributes to its popularity and long lines.  I don't think there is anywhere on the strip you could find a more affordable meal unless you are completely desperate and stumble towards a fast food chain like McDonald's or Subway.  Speaking of Subway, Earl's is nothing like Subway or Quiznos for that matter.  I was somewhat expecting Earl's to be like these two popular chains but fortunately, Earl's was a few hundred notches up on the sandwich ladder.  Earl has a extremely efficient ordering and sandwich production line.  I promplty received my order within a couple minutes of payment, mind you, there was quite the crowd so the speed of execution was quite impressive and would make any VP of Operations proud.  When a place is so hyped up I'm usually faced with bitter disappointment but I'm happy to say that this time, with Earl's, I wasn't disappointed.  Mind you, it wasn't a life altering experience and harps and giggling angels didn't fill my head after the first bite but overall, it was one of my best sandwich experiences.  Because of all the hype, I took it upon myself to try as many sandwiches during my visit as possible so I promptly ordered the Original roast beef, the Earl's Club, the Italian and the Jerk Chicken along with a brownie, a Blue Moon Beer and a Coke.  Before you start pondering what a complete pig I am, I shared these with my group of 4 so everyone got a 1/4 sandwich each.  This was a great way to try a wide selection of their sandwiches, a prix fix Earl's sampling if you would.  On to the actual sandwiches.   The Original was superb.  The roast beef was juicy and flavorful, the horshradish was spicy and blended perfectly with the beef and sharp cheddar cheese.  It was light years ahead of the roast beef sandwich I had at Quiznos just a few weeks before. The Club was also very delightful with turkey and ham with fresh lettece and tomatoes.  The Italian wasn't my favorite with its Pastrami and ham combination but everyone else in my group thought it was terrific, I guess I'm not a big fan of Pastrami.  For me, the star of the show was the Jerk Chicken.  The chicken was moist and the Jerk sauce added a spicy kick to this exceptional sandwich.  The thing that made all these sandwiches special was the bread.  Only one kind of bread is served at Earl's and its their artisan white perfectly toasted.  If you believe that bread is what makes a great sandwich then Earl's should be your sandwich Mecca because you would be extremely hard pressed to find another worthy opponent.  Hmmmm, I seem to have written too much....I doubt any of you will actually read to this point but for those that make it this far, thanks, I'm relieved my rambling was entertaining enough to retain your attention for this long.  I guess I'll just summerize Earl's in one last line.  If you haven't tried Earl Of Sandwich, you should listen to all these 5 star Yelp reviews and take the plunge, you'll most likely become another raver like myself.",

I didn't know what it was, but the bread was fresh, the beef was flavorful and tender and the sauce was delicious!

Ok, so 5 stars is the max, but since I went here twice in one weekend and had a 5-star experience both times, that means Earl of Sandwich at Planet Hollywood-Las Vegas gets a 10-star review from me!  My sister has been raving about Earl of Sandwich forever and saying that she always goes there every time she's in Vegas, and she thought that I had already eaten there with her.  Well, one taste of their delicious sandwich and I was sure that I hadn't been there before, because if I had I would've never eaten any other sandwich.  My family was on vacation in Vegas last weekend, and we ate at Earl of Sandwich twice on two separate nights.  The first night, I had the Chipotle Chicken Avocado sandwich, pretty affordable at $6.49.  The second night, I had the Caribbean Jerk Chicken sandwich, even a better price at $5.99.  Out of the two, I preferred the Chipotle Chicken Avocado, but both sandwiches were amazing.  I love the hot, crispy artisan bread, and not being a fan of eating chicken at restaurants in general, I loved the chicken.  Service was fast and friendly, even when it is packed as it was both times we were there.  If you haven't already tried Earl of Sandwich, you have to!  Next, I plan to eat at the new one at Downtown Disney, which recently opened.  I'm so glad there's one in Orange County now.  Hopefully, it will be just as awesome!",

Sandwiches are reasonable in the $6-$7 range and it's definitely worth it!! Earl's has the best hot sandwiches in Vegas, hands down!! I had the Montagu (roast beef, turkey, swiss, american) and it was superb. There's something about the bread that they use and how well it toasts and melts all the ingredients together. My friends had the Caprice (all veggie) and the Meatball and all three was awesome. I also tried their broccoli and cheddar soup and that too was amazing.  Lunch came out to $12 which is pretty good for lunch on the strip. My only gripe is that the nearest Earl to SoCal is in Vegas. Looks like I'll be making extra trips to Sin City....",

So i thought eh..I'd probably only come here if I was close by. And what do you know..I decided to go to Urban Outfitters this weekend and I no longer had an excuse not to eat here. So here's the rundown of our experience:  The staff was organized,fast, and friendly. We didn't wait for our food for a long time, probably because it wasn't that busy. We sat on a table that was oddly placed by itself with one other table. And the food? Man I scarfed it down so fast I was almost ready to get another one..but opted to get potato salad instead. The sandwich I got was the tuna melt..minus the cheese, so it was basically a tuna sandwich. The bread was warm,crispy on the outside and soft on the inside. My only complaint was that they could've been a little more generous with the tuna, but it was no biggie. Oh and that potato salad was  oh so good. The bf got The Original which he actually enjoyed. He said it was a lot better than last time but could've used more au jus.  All in all, we spent under 18 bucks, including water, and was fully satisfied with the meal. Would I say this is the best tuna sandwich I've ever had? Probably not. But the best tuna sandwich I've had in the strip so far? Absolutely!",

I ordered the meatball sandwich whereas many others recommended the tuna melt. I wasn't feeling the tuna anyway. What I loved about the place is the toasted bread. The bread was light and fluffy and it came with a nice crust from the toasting. The meatballs were decent although probably not the best I've ever had. The marinara was a little on the sweeter side and it could probably use a dash of fresh herbs to spruce it up.   Overall, not bad and I would go back. The seating situation sucks so I would go during offpeak hours.",

I really like the bread here and I was surprised at how affordable the prices were. $6 for a sandwich isn't bad at all. Seemed quite popular too, but service was fast.

We had to add Grey Poupon to the Full Montagu, and that made it 10x better.  The bread is toasted with magic. Omgoodness.

Brief Summary -- Delicious hot sandwiches -- Open 24 hours -- Almost always BUSY -- Free samples if you're in the long line -- Great poatoe salad  This place is cheap and easy just like Las Vegas! Well maybe its cheaper...  Basically you get in the long line and you get processed decently quick, depending on how many employees are there, etc.  I think I got \"Earl's Club\" or maybe it was \"Club of Earl\"? Not sure. It was turkey, bacon, subbed cheddar instead of swiss, lettuce, subbed onions instead of tomatoe on their bread roll with \"sandwich sauce.\"  It was hot, fresh and delicious.   I also got the poatoe salad, which was amazing and it was only $1.79!! They have a lot of different sides, drinks, desserts and options. I wish I would have tried something else but the Club was awesome both times.  My GF got the Full Montagu (sp?) both times and I tasted it, it was good. The 2nd time, the mustard was a little overbearing but it blended well with the roast beef.  If you're a baller on a budget or you just want a good, cheap sandwich, come on over to Miracle Mile Shops for Earl of Sandwich!",

The portions here don't look like much, but seriously, we all were huffin' and puffin' as we walked away.

One of the reasons I stay at Planet Hollywood is that I love having access to a warm, filling, and delicious Earl's Sandwich 24 hours a day...This place is always busy and for good reason. Sandwiches run about $6-$7 and even with a side and a drink, you'll be a little over $10.   Each sandwich is toasted and made to order, so it always comes out nice and warm.  Everybody has their own favorite and mine is the Hawaiian BBQ Chicken. BBQ Chicken, pineapple, and ham is the best! However, the Chipotle Chicken, Tuna Melt, Roast Beef, Pastrami sandwiches are my other picks haha. To be honest, you can't really go wrong here..whether you are sober or not!  The busiest times are during peak meal times (12-1pm, 5-7pm) and after hours for the  clubbing crowd. However, there usually is a line regardless of any time of the day. My only gripe about this place is that sandwiches can be put together pretty sloppy...especially when it's busy. On my last trip this past weekend, they didn't cut the bread all the way through and were skimpy on meat filling (cranberry turkey sandwich). The other 2 times I ate here, everything was all good (normal day time hours).  PRO TIP: If you can't grab a seat/table...take your food over to the sportsbook at the PH! It's right across from Earls, and you can enjoy your sandwich while catching up on the games in a big comfy sofa!   Earl's you never fail me! Thank you.",

I always ask if they can substitute the tomatoes for cucumbers instead. They are really flexible and can do a lot of substitutions. This place is extremely cheap and the sandwiches are very filling. Their bread is what makes this place delicious, it's always super crispy and toasted to perfection.   It's the best place to go grab a quick bite to eat if you're in a rush or don't wanna wait too long.   I also tried their egg and cheese breakfast sammiche but I prefer the caprese. The egg is just too thin and not super tasty. They only serve breakfast until 11am!",

It's open 24 hours which mean the drunken masses allllll come here after the a night of drinking... So around 2ish the line gets crazy long. And there are a lot of mistakes with sandwiches during that time (in my experience). Anyway... I always get their Italian sandwich and it's so delish! They are sometimes a little heavy handed on the vinegar so if you don't like that kick you may want to ask for light dressing. I eat here often when I'm at PH especially because I feel the price point is relatively reasonable for Vegas.   Happy eating!",

Regular soups are $4.49.  We tried the Tortilla Soup, which was spicy and thick like a chili, and the Baked Potato Soup, which was bland compared to the Tortilla Soup, I would skip this one.  Hot 6-inch sub sandwiches are $6.49.  We tried the Chipotle Chicken Avocado which had chunks of chicken and avocado with a mild sauce, the Earl's Club with bacon and cheese, and our favorite of the three sandwiches, the Full Montague with roast beef, turkey and Swiss.

I think after 6 years, the quality of the bread, meats and the taste still the same.  One thing I noted was the line was super long 6 years ago. This time, maybe it was between breakfast & lunch, there was no line. Both times I went this year had no long lines anymore. Both were between meal times.  The service was still as good. I tried the Earl signature sandwich, the bread was soft, meat was fresh and not too salty. The soup I ordered (tomato soup) was tangy, creamy and full of substance, No watery at all. Next time when I go back to Vegas I will surely go back again to get my sandwich fix.",

There's hardly ever a line when I go because who eats sandwiches that late...haha.  Anywho, let me start off my saying I love Earls! They have mostly every possible combination of a sandwich you want. Being from Hawaii, I was craving pineapple. Turns out they have a sandwich with pineapple and it was delicious! My usual order though is either the The Earls Club or the Holiday Turkey. I love the holiday turkey because it's basically thanksgiving in sandwich form. It's just an explosion of flavor in every bite.  Now let's talk atmosphere. Considering this location is in Planet Hollywood, it can get pretty loud. There's a bar across from it and the casino on the other end. So when talking you might want to speak up. They have couple TVs mounted on the walls for you to watch...usually plays sports but at one point I caught it on Comedy Central once lol. There's plenty of open seating at night but during the day it tends to be kind of full.  Customer service here is decent. They always cater to your needs. Looking at a menu can be overwhelming at times, so don't hesitate to ask for help! I mean that's how I found my fave sandwich. They tend to be quick with their orders. They give you a buzzer to notify you when your food is ready.  Overall, considering that this place is open 24/7...def my go-to place if I want something quick but delicious.",

    "text": "in our 4 days here, we went here like 3 times that i am aware of.  prices aren't too bad at $5.99 a sandwich and they taste really good.  not super packed but they hit the spot.  i wish they were stuffed a little bit more, but they are still very good for the price in my opinion.  the bread makes the sandwich as it is toasted and very good, almost like really good mexican torta bread.  i had the caprese, full montagu, and the italian.  i would highly recommend either of them and i can't really say any was better than the other because they were all different and delicious.  i think it helped with the italian that we had some salad in our room and i threw that onto the sandwich while we were in the room as it made it a little more beefy and added some more flavor.  place is open 24 hours i think, but i am sure it is open at late hours as we stopped here after partying at the marquee all night so it was probably like 3 or 4 in the morning and they were still open.  eitherway, when i am back at PH next month for my stay, ill probalby be here at least once",

Everything that they have is made daily which guarantees that every bite will be filled with fresh deliciousness.. One new change to Earls is that it is now open 24/7! WHAAA?? Earl's Sandwiches anytime I want?!? That's insane.. But I love it... I forgot the first sandwich I ever tried there, but all I know is that I flew to heaven and came back to sin city with every bite.. The second one that I tried was the Jerk Chicken Sandwich which was just recently and it was amazing. If you're in Vegas and you're near Planet Hollywood.. drop in and have yourself a bite of a;slkjbasldij. :) That's how good it is.. I can't put in real words. What're you waiting for? Go try it... You're wasting time.. Oh wait nvm.. I mentioned it was open 24/7 ;)",

I had teh full montagu (roast beef and roast turkey with swiss cheese) and i gotta say, this was a pretty good damn sandwich --- at first i was kind of disappointed because there wasnt much in between the slices of bread - but when i bit into it, mmmmmmm the bread was warm and crisp yet soft, with a somewhat light buttery flavor and the cheese was melted perfectly - the sandwich practically melted in my mouth.... i finished mine in no time and wanted more!!!!!!",

So while most people are enjoying family dinner's Christmas eve, we decided to walk the strip and headed back to this place for some grub. The menu looks very vanilla. However, our sandwiches were anything but ordinary. Husband got holiday special which was like Thanksgiving dinner with all the fixings on their bread. I got The Earl's Club and had a When Harry Met Sally moment eating this sandwich. So freaking good--and I KNOW turkey sandwiches. I think the most amazing part is their bread. It looks all white and doughy before it goes in and then when you get your sandwich it has been perfectly toasted and is scrumptious.  We actually took some friend's back there the weekend after Christmas for a repeat performance. And a repeat it was... so good.  Be warned: these sandwiches take a bit of time and both times there was a pretty good wait. However, with the exceptional quality of the sandwich and bonus price of only $5.95, you can wait.",

    "text": "Very disappointed in this place. I am a sandwich lover. The bread they use is fantastic, but they hardly put any fillings inside the sandwiches, and the fillings are not high quality. The photos of the sandwiches here on Yelp, and on the posterboards in the store, are totally misleading. On our 3 sandwiches, you couldn't even see the filling unless you opened them up. They are beyond skimpy on the meat and cheese. I was also disappointed that they didn't offer a pastrami sandwich, I found the rest of the selection very limited too. The prices are cheap, but the sandwiches are tiny, and are 90% all bread. Please, charge me more money, and give me better quality meat and cheese, and put a little more on the sandwich, so it is more than just a bread sandwich. Their holiday turkey and stuffing sandwich was inedible it was so bad. It had a funny taste to it, the stuffing was bad, and there was only one small clump of the cranberry on one spot on my sandwich. Try some fresh carved turkey, and not some pedestrian lunchmeat turkey. The two good things about this place are the bread, and they do make your sandwich quickly, but that is partly because they don't waste time putting much inside the sandwich itself. I had way better sandwiches at 2 other places in Vegas. I find it very interesting that people can be fooled into thinking a sandwich is a good, based on the bread alone. If you like good bread and tiny portions of tasteless meat and cheese, then this is the place. I make a better sandwich with my panini maker at home. I will only go back when I am in the mood for toast. The high ratings on this place, must be the result of some kind of mass hysteria, or people who were weaned on Subway sandwiches.",

Unfortunately it's only white bread, there's no whole wheat or multigrain.  I tried the Original, which is a roast beef with chedder and I think horseradish(?). It was very good.  A balanced amount of fillings to bread, the meat had some flavor and was a good texture even if it wasn't astounding.  Ditto with the cheese and the sauce was tasty but didn't overpower the other flavors.  And it was something like $7.  I also tried a sugar cookie, which was fine and not chemically at all (that's amazing for a restaurant cookie) but I wish I'd read the short list of ingredients a little closer and noticed that there's no butter in the cookie...who makes a sugar cookie without flavor (butter)?  The salt and vinegar chips were good too.  I would go here again if I was looking for a relatively inexpensive meal and I was nearby but I don't think I'd necessarily go out of my way.",

My boyfriend always makes a stop at Earl's every time he's in Vegas. He knows I am a huge food buff, so he shared this excellent sandwich shop with me. That afternoon, Earl's had a special sandwhich, which was a BBQ brisket sandwhich; we ordered that and a Full Montagu. I remember standing in line trying to decide what to order, when I got a glimpse of the bread. I was thinking to myself, \"why is the bread not cooked or brown?\" It's because they toast the bread on both sides. It's so delicious and nothing compares to that light, toasty sandwich. I wish there was an Earl's around LA. I would go there everyday for lunch! The price is about $6 a sandwich which is good for something so tasty. My boyfriend and I shared the 2 sandwiches, so I had a taste of both. Next time when I am in Vegas, I will be stopping there and having their sandwiches.",

I should've gotten a clue when an earlier customer complained about how her sandwich was made (they had to re-do it twice as in third time's the charm.)   So I ordered the Earl Club which is turkey, bacon, swiss, lettuce, tomato, and sandwich sauce.   I dug into my sandwich and was thinking geez, kind of skimpy on the filling. I looked at it's contents and my Earl Club magically turned into a BLT. I had a really long day so I actually thought that's what I ordered (BLT) and didn't think anything of it. But when I looked at my receipt later on I realized the super lousy sandwich maker forgot to put in the turkey and swiss. What a Turkey!   A cup of soda is now 3 bucks.

    "text": "**** 2.5 stars ****  I suppose this is technically an edible sandwich and it's cheap, which is the only reason I'm rounding up here, but what the hell is with all this praise? 2,000 reviews+ and still a 4.5 star rating for something less edible than any random Quiznos or Potbelly... I just don't get it. Granted, I was doing everything I could to keep my brain from pounding out of my skull as Brian and I waited patiently in the somewhat quick moving but incredibly long line, but I still think I was functioning enough to know that this was a disappointment of pretty big proportions.  A few years ago when Nicole was staying in Vegas for a brief conference I suggested the Earl as one of the places she should definitely hit for a quick meal, based mainly on the overwhelming number of positive reviews. Her response was basically \"it's a good sandwich\", with little emphasis in either direction. I thought, OK, maybe she just tried the wrong one (although it was definitely the one I would have gone for as well). I happened to see Venu N's review just prior to my trip, and it sort of confirmed what I was fearing, that this was somehow just the average public broadcasting basement show which somehow snowballed itself into primetime relevance. Or perhaps it's some combination of groupthink with the more dangerous drunkthink.  I think I only paid about $6 for my \"Cannonballs!\" sandwich, which is probably fair enough, but it was just so unimpressive. Just look at the photo, it's sad. The bread was warm and toasted on the ends but not so much in the middle, and the meatballs were sparse and cold inside. I felt less awful, physically, after eating it, but I'm not so sure that statement couldn't have applied to virtually anything at that point. There really just isn't anything special here. I was certainly still hungry afterwards, as these sandwiches are pretty small when compared to their competition.  I implore you, ignore all the \"amazing\" and \"OMG\" nonsense that you'll read here. It really is quite a simple creation that has a different name people aren't familiar with (outside of the Yelp praise), and thus they mistakenly value it higher than any other chain which could easily supplant it. If you, for some reason, happen to be in this dreadful mall and simply cannot make it anywhere else before dying of starvation, then go ahead and eat here. Otherwise, find a better meal elsewhere, because really, who comes to Vegas to go the cheap route?",

My usual is the avocado chipotle. It's heaven, that's always my go to. I even bought one for the boyfriend. Didn't eat it until the next day on the way back to the bay because we were so full from all the buffets. It was still amazing the next day.... That says something.",

To some having a \"thanksgiving\" meal in sandwich form may not sound appealing but since that is my favorite holiday how can I resist all the holiday favorites in one thing. From the outside it may not look appealing but you definitely cannot judge a book by its cover when I comes go this sandwich. For $6.49 (regular) this can definitely fulfill any holiday meal craving you may have not matter time of year (Turkey, cranberry sauce, stuffing or filling for us east coasters, and gravy). I will definitely continue coming here and unless they stop making this sandwich I'll stick to my holiday turkey.",

I think this place is definitely better than Quiznos/Subway/Jimmy Johns/etc (though a tad more expensive than those places).   The soup was mediocre but the salads looked good.  All in all, a solid place to eat at and I would go again for sure.",

    "text": "Finally got to try Earl of Sandwich after hearing so many good things about it! Let me just say, it definitely lives up to its hype.  I've only been here once, but that's all it took. Their sandwiches are definitely delicious! I ordered The Original 1762 (roast beef, cheese, and horseradish sauce) and it was amazing. My sister tried their Veggie sandwich and she seemed to really like it. My mom tried the All American, but she said the cranberries in it made it too sweet, they put too much in the sandwich, and just ruined it for her. My dad had the Full Montague and he said it was pretty good. I think what makes their sandwiches so good though, is their BREAD. It's super fresh! Another plus is that they're open 24 hours, so it's perfect for all the late night munchies. My sister told me the last time she went to Vegas, Earl of Sandwich was all she and her friends ate!  You MUST try this place when you go to Vegas! Thank you, Planet Hollywood :)",

I absolutely love avocado so this seemed like a natural choice for me. The bread has a nicely toasted exterior, yet still manages to stay warm and soft inside. The chipotle sauce added a nice hint of spiciness and the fresh avocado was absolutely delicious.  The fact that they're open 24 hours to accomodate hungry drunk people is just awesome. Incredibly satisfying and it won't break the bank. I'll be back for sure whenever I'm in Vegas.",

Boyfriend and I ordered (we weren't too hungry): -The full montagu (about $6): roast beef, turkey, swiss cheese, cheddar cheese, lettuce, roma tomatoes, mustard.  the sandwich is nice and toasty and there's just the right amount of everything.   -Chicken soup (about $3): this actually had a lot of tender chicken chunks and soft pasta.  It had a lot of flavor and I thought it was pretty tasty (I was kind of surprised).  Overall, Earl of Sandwich is cheap, quick and tasty.  It's actually very cheap, considering it's prime Vegas location.  The bread is probably the best part about the sandwich.  It's fluffy, yet has a good amount of chewiness and the toasty-ness of it is perfect.  Definitely worth a try.  Even if you don't like sandwiches, they have wraps, salads, and some desserts too.  Notes: -They have a birthday club.  Sign up! -Line may be long, but it moves quickly.",

It wasn't 3am; it was 9pm. I was sober, and I knew that there were numerous other affordable options if I was willing to hop back into my car and motor into the hinterlands of local Las Vegas.  With all that in consideration, what the fiddlesticks? Yes, my sandwich tasted yummy and warm, but a couple of concerns:  1. What are your bread options? None. You're getting a white bun. It is a good white bun, a delectable cross between a biscuit and ciabatta, but I am a girl who enjoys at least the option of wheat.  2. Do they have hot peppers? No. I think the hallmark of a noble sandwich shop is their ability to heat up a sammie with peppers. The spiciest thing the Earl offers is pepperoncini. That does not count. It might as well be a pickle.  3. Where's the beef? The meat inside the slices was a little skimpy. The ratio of bread to meat was approximately 3 to 1.   4. Am I full? After one sandwich, I am pretty sure I could have eaten another without suffering from a stomach ache.   Yes, the end product tastes darn good. They are open 24-hours. My husband celebrated the option of Diet Dew on the fountain. The food is affordable for the Strip, but I wouldn't make it a point to return to The Strip just to visit with the Earl.",

We got two sandwiches and two very small bags of chips for $26. Now I know that everything is more expensive in Vegas, that's just the way it is, but the quality of food should live up to the price.  I got the Full Montagu and the wife got the Hawaiian BBQ, service was quick, we sat down for a minute and the sandwiches were already done. Mine had a very sweet mustard sauce on it which I thought was a little gross, I kept squeezing yellow mustard on it to tang it up a bit, the sign said \"mustard sauce\" had I know it was a sweet sauce I would have nixed it. The bread was \"toasted\" mine was pretty much burnt and very hard to bite into. The wife LOVED her Hawaiian BBQ sandwich, the bread was perfect for her, although there was a bit too much BBQ sauce for her liking.  It was edible and did the job of filling me up, but I wouldn't go back unless there was no other option.",

I hesitated for a split second in giving it 4-stars, but I am indeed a fan (though not for its flavor, which is what reviews are usually based on).  The line is usually pretty long, which can be a major turn-off if you're in a hurry.  But the service is prompt, and prices are not bad at ~$6/sandwich.  I'm no sandwich connoisseur, but the bread is warm and chewy (with a crispy crust), and the flavor is good.  It's not spectacular, but it's a solid.  For its convenience at the Miracle Mile shops, connected to Planet Hollywood, and across from Cosmopolitan, it is my go-to spot for a sandwich.  Plus, the people watching can be good as lotsa people hit up this place...",

They are either open late or 24 hrs, because we arrived after 2am and were able to order a sandwich.  I started with the Club and tried the All American on the 2nd visit - both awesome, but the Club was better.  My husband started with the BLT and tried the Hawaiian BBQ on the 2nd visit - both awesome, but he liked the BLT better.  My other friend is in love with the Full Montague and thought the soup was tasty as well.  Their unique brick-shaped tasty bread and their sandwich sauces make this place so good that now that we've returned home from Vegas, we have looked up all other Earl of Sandwich locations and will make a special stop next time we go to one of those cities.,",

Stuff of sandwich legend.  I really liked the \"Full Montagu\" as well with Roast Beef, Turkey, Swiss and veggies topped with the yummy mustard sauce.   Also, the chocolate puddlng (when you want something sweet) really hits the spot for late night desserts!  Delicious as per usual. So delicious I went twice that weekend, as mentioned above and another day in Los Angeles at the Downtown Disney location.",

I saw Earl of Sandwich and thought this place is open 24/7 and there is massive people here it must be good !   Waited in line for about 5 minutes and decided on a classic BLT. Man, that sandwich was TASTY. I finished it before going back to my room. It was only 6.95 which is a steal for what other sandwiches I could have gotten as well. The bread was soooo good and the bacon was perfect.   Will recommend this to anyone on a budget, drunk or who just wants a sandwich that inst made by a \"artist\" . SOLID 5 STAR",

Not much else can be said about this place because the 1500+ reviews seriously speak for themselves, but this place is amazing and a great value!   $5.99 for a sandwich!!! WHAT IS THAT?! I tried the Tuna Melt, Full Montague and Meatball. I really, really enjoyed the Tuna Melt. Simple, yet effective! I also tried the Tomato and Brocolli Cheddar Soup. Both were delicious for only $2.99! Soup and sandwich for $9.71!!  I came here all three days I was in Vegas. That's right. 100% attendance for me at Earl of Sandwich. If only I could say the same thing about my class schedule heheh.  Anyway, there was always a line when I came, but the line passes by so quickly that you'll be NOMing on your sandwich before you know it. They are so quick to make the orders. I seriously paid for my meal and my buzzer started buzzing as I was putting my card away. :O  Parking is in the Planet Hollywood structure. From the structure is kind of a long trek to this place, but it's worth it. Just make a left at the information desk as you exit the structure and take the 3rd inlet on the left to reach this magical place.  Good from AM to PM. All day errday. All hours of the day. 24 hours, baby!",

Update: THIS IS THE BEST SANDWICH I HAVE EVER HAD IN MY LIFE. I'm so effing serious. And they're only $5-6! This place would put Quiznos AND Subway out of business if they opened some up in California. In my opinion ;)  All of the sandwiches are great, but I HIGHLY recommend coming here during the holiday season (November-January) and getting the Turkey Holiday Sandwich. Envision this: creamy stuffing, cranberry dressing, yummy turkey, warm bready-saucey-Thanksgiving goodness sandwiched between two slices of heaven. Speaking of slices -- WHAT THE F do they put in that BREAD?! It's so soft and simply...scrumptious.  I've taken numerous people here since the last review, both friends and family. We are all now believers. My friends and I stayed at Aria the last time we were in Vegas and made the trek across the Strip bridge just because we'd been dreaming of it. And believe me, that walk is NOT fun in heels, but the sandwich was worth it. The best part? It's 24 hours! My go-to quick meal spot any hour of the night in Vegas, unless I'm staying somewhere that's too far.",

I ordered the Earl Club and my bf ordered the jerk chicken. The club was DELICIOUS! It is probably one of the best hot sandwiches I have ever had! The jerk chicken was also good, the flavors were more bold, but not as appetizing as the club in my opinion. The sandwiches are small for the price, but they are worth it!  There's plenty of tables to eat, but when its busy, you might have trouble finding a table in the restaurant area itself, but you can always walk around the shopping center and find some place to eat.  If you are in Vegas and need to grab a quick meal, grab a sandwich! You won't be disappointed!",

When we got there, we both ordered the Montagu sandwich which includes the following: toasted artisan bread, roast beef, turkey, swiss cheese, crisp lettuce, tomato, and mustard.  It's not close to a 6 inch sandwich, but it's probably smaller.  Nevertheless, after a few bites, I got full since it was so filling and delicious! What I loved about this place was not only the seating availability, but their offerings of Tabasco sauce, grey poupon, mustard and others! Yum!

Their bread is made slightly undercooked so that it cooks and toasts fully when the sandwich goes through the conveyor oven with all the filling. Everything was really really good; the bread was always perfectly toasted and piping hot.   We ate: Hawaiian: A little too salty, will not get again Full Montagu: REALLY GOOD! Earl's Club: Friends said really good The Original: Also good  Get the full montagu and earl's club definitely. 2 mornings in a row we got the bacon, egg and cheese sandwich too - really really good. They serve breakfast until 11, but you can get the other sandwiches any time you want.   The kona coffee they serve is also pretty good :). We will be back!!!",

This place is open 24 hours which is fantastic and there is nothing better than to eat than their Original sandwich (roast beef) when you're walking around drunk/hyper-like.  Every time we've come here the line isn't too bad and the food is served fast.  It's always hot, so I feel assured that it's not sitting under a heat lamp in the back somewhere.  It's also cheap, which in Vegas, is rare. I think its about $7 or $8 for the Original sandwich and its a good size, I'm always full after devouring it.

We had breakfast sandwiches that were hot, fresh, and delicious at a very reasonable prices (about $4 for a sandwich). I also had coffee, $1.99 for a cup that I believe was similar to the size of a grande at Starbucks. The coffee was Kona coffee and it was sooo good. We returned a couple of days later for some more coffee and a prepackaged brownie. The coffee was still good and the brownie was awesome. If you're looking for a quick, easy, good breakfast, stop here. I'm sure their lunches are just as good.",

I'm sorry; maybe it's because I'm starving after a whole night of partying or maybe it's because i'm drunk (it's very likely a combination of both), but the Full Montagu is freakin mouth-watering. It literally melts in my mouth. The mustard sauce that comes with it is really good as well (and I'm not a huge fan of sauce). I've visited the Earl of Sandwich in Downtown Disney, and the sandwiches are not as good there. This makes me come to the conclusion that the reason why this place is so good is indeed because I'm always drunk when I frequent this place. But it's okay; I'll give the place 5 stars anyway.",

My friends and I stayed at the Fountain Suite at PH, and we would eat here at least once a day -- whether its lunch time, dinner time, or early mornings after our drunken debaucheries.   I loved their Full Montague. Its a must try! When I was there back in November, they had a Thanksgiving special sandwich that included stuffing and cranberry sauce. Amazing!  If I was crapping money, sure I'd eat at a buffet all day every day. But I'm not, and Earl's sandwich is a great place to sit down and eat wit your friends for cheap!",

I couldn't believe the sandwiches are only $5.99! WOW! I had a bit of difficulty deciding between several sandwiches, but my veteran friends were telling me to try the Full Montagu. So I did. IT WAS AMAZING! The roast beef was really tender, the bread was toasted perfectly (I hate soggy sandwich bread), the ingredients were fresh, and amazing flavor! I finished the whole thing...and such occurrences are few and far between. I wasn't even that hungry! That's how good the sandwich was. I will DEFINITELY come back again to try a different sandwich.   Plenty of seating is a plus; our group was rather large and we combined a few tables.  I was rather sad that most of the places in Vegas don't have free wifi...but Earl of Sandwich has it's own FREE wifi! COOL!   Thank you EOS, I will be back!",

The sandwich itself would only be three stars, but I bumped it up to four because of convenience (it's inside the Miracle Mile shops at Planet Hollywood) and affordability by Vegas standards.",

Glad to have found this place because it was definitely well worth looking for it in the Miracle Mile shopping center. Oh by the way the only thing that sucked was that the self parking lot was wayyyy at the other side where this place is at. But I'm serious...it was worth the walk.  I had the Montagu sandwich, loaded potato soup and a drink and it was all $11.86 The sandwich which pretty large and very delicious. Turkey and roast beef were really good quality. The bread was outstanding...very tasty. I didn't need a soup but it just sounded delicious when I was reading the menu. So I had to order it...so glad I did :)  I wanted to go back to this place instead of checking out the Backstage Deli. But I figured I should give the other high rated sandwich place a try....let's just say I was kicking myself afterward!

And now that it's open 24hrs, it's the perfect late night munchies spot after a day's partying and gambling.  What makes their sandwiches so out of this world is a combination of deliciously toasty, but fluffy bread that doesn't give your jaw a workout , and some incredible sauces to top off the generous helping of meats.  It's all delivered in a nicely tucked golden brick...\"1 kilo\" as my buddies like to call it.  Each savory bite is juicy, tender, and with so many sandwich choices, you can't go wrong cause they're all good.    My personal favorite is the Montagu but first timers should definitely check out the Original.  I've recommended this place to so many friends and their reactions are generally along the lines of \"oh wow! so good\" and \"I want to make love to this sandwich.\"  Forget Subway.  Forget Quizno's.  Earl is the sh*t.  It's too bad this is the only location around in the West.  I really hope they expand into SoCal area cause I love this place!  Sandwiches are tops and at $6-7 a pop, it's very reasonable.  Their Earl's iced tea (iced tea lemonade) is a great complement.  Earl claims they are the first to introduce the toasted sandwich.

The giant, almost grotesque pile of par-baked white bread 'loaves' at Earl Of Sandwich are a huge turn-off - hide that nasty pale bread, guys! No whole wheat bread choice. White bread is all they've got - the sandwich nutritional equivalent of an iceberg salad. 21 locations across the USA and growing? You're going to stunt our growth, Earl! Please stop!  And, this is how they get 'cha: if you're hungry, you will want two (2) sandwiches, and that will set you back $12. These are relatively small sandwiches with very little going for them on the inside - under 2 oz. of meat, and no 'extra veggie' options. If you were to get a free sandwich on an AmTrak Train ride, this is pretty much the sandwich you would expect to receive.  Because of this experience, every time I am among the very slim pickings at Newark Airport Terminal A, I pick the Jamba Juice cart every time over the Earl Of Sandwich. Not sure if the Earl Of Sandwich's popularity comes from it's Disney World roots or what, but I crown thee now: the Runt Of Sandwich!  You really think that Nolan Ryan and Roger Clemens actually eat this sh*t? (They are two of the original franchisees!)",

    "text": "I love the flavors of this place and the location. Good sandwiches and the Pleasure Pit--can I ask for more? Quick tips first though!  1. There is a parking structure that enters into the rear of the Miracle Mile Shops.  2. Earl of Sandwich is located near the entrance of the casino via Las Vegas Blvd.  3. If you're taking the walkway, the shop is on the first floor. There is no direct elevator down to the first floor from the second floor shops! Use the escalator. Walk past, til you see Pinks and go into the doors of Planet Hollywood.  Earl of Sandwich is one of our favorite stops in Vegas. The food is really great, the service is pretty fast, and the prices are really good--at least for Vegas. My favorite sandwich here is the Hawaiian Chicken. MAN the sauce is amazing on it and the pineapple slice along with the melted cheese is almost heavenly. Whenever my girlfriend and I come, we always order at least one Hawaiian Chicken sandwich.  We've also had the Earl Club, the Chipotle Chicken, and the Full Montagu. The first two sandwiches are good, though the Earl Club is a little too over the top with the sandwich sauce that they provide. It can get a little too messy and salty or it can be awesome and just right. The Chipotle Chicken is great too with a lovely chipotle sauce as well as avocados and bacon. The only thing we would not really recommend is the Full Montagu, just not as flavorful for us. The great thing about Earl of Sandwich is that their breads are toasted and rolled out of the machine on the spot. In fact you can watch them make your sandwich and roll it out on the grilling rack.  One of the things that I like is that even when the line is long, I can expect to wait maybe 10 minutes or so before ordering. The food is quick to come out as well. The only thing I would possibly say is an issue is that the service people may appear to be a little bit snippy when you're ordering a sandwich. This can be forgiven since I know that they deal with some fairly obnoxious guests that can be a little too drunk.  Anyways, the prices are what makes this place really special. Realistically, $6.49 (Hot) or $5.99 (cold) sandwiches would be nothing to go on about in LA or in any other city for that matter, especially when you consider that the size of the sandwiches are not gargantuan and may be even on the small side. However, being that it is 1. in Vegas and 2. in a casino, the prices that they set are pretty budget. I love this place just for the fact that my girlfriend and I can get full off of $20.  I just want to point out though that besides the sandwiches, we have also tried some desserts that they offer. My girlfriend swears by the chocolate brownie. I'm not a brownie person myself, but I can agree that it is rich and definitely chocolatey. Hope you guys can try it out for yourself!",

Its great for eating there or to go since they have enough seating. Even their cookies are delightful! Particularly chocolate chip (: Have been to this place at least once every Vegas trip and will probably continue to do so in the future. Ideal for a good snack I would say!",

    "text": "Earl of Sandwich was on my Vegas bucket list since the closest one to me is at the Detroit airport. I knew that it might be my last chance to try it for awhile, so how could I pass it up?  After making the walk down to Planet Hollywood, we were able to find it right away in the Miracle Mile shops. We made it right before the lunch rush 'cause as we waited, a line of about 20-30 people formed behind us. Woohoo for good timing! Even though I'd already scoped the pics on Yelp, I still couldn't help but be ultra giddy when I got my gold wrapped sandwich. Bling blinging!  Yelp has very rarely failed me and it did anything but fail me on the tuna melt. That sandwich was so melty, so delicious, so mouth watering, so cheap. Of course I'm a fan. And the bread? Wow..that WAS the best part. The only reason I'm not giving Earl 5 stars is because it didn't fill me up quite the way I'd hoped.   Who said you can't eat cheap in Vegas?",

    "text": "I never thought I would say this about a sandwich shop in a Vegas Casino. But yes, their sandwich is the best I have had.  Happened to be in Planet Hollywood after a show and wanted a quick light meal. I remembered reading about Earl of Sandwich before. Even though this place has an average of 4.5 stars on Yelp, I was still skeptical. I didn't think I could trust the opinions of some drunk gamblers and crazy tourists. I couldn't be more wrong.  All American Sandwich - sweet cranberries, savory melted cheese and roasted turkey on freshly grilled sandwich bread matched with crunchy lettuce and juicy tomato slices. The result is an addicting complex flavor that lingers on your tongue and leaves you wanting more.   The Earl's Cobb Wrap - This wrap variation of their most popular hot sandwich is just as memorable. The old wrap has the perfect texture. Thick enough to not get soggy yet still soft and not grainy at all. The fillings were amazing.   At the end of my meal I was tempted to pick up another sandwich to go. Had I not had another meal scheduled the next day, I would come here for another sandwich... and another one.  Oh please.... would someone bring Earl of Sandwich to California?",

With over 300 reviews, I'm so surprised no one's told me to come here before!  With the new City Center sky bridges connecting Aria to the PH, it's so convenient to walk across the street for a bite. Its right at the entrance of PH and you can't miss it. There is plenty of seating around after you order at the counter. Every sandwich is baked to order. I had the Earl's Club (Roasted Turkey, Smoked Bacon, Swiss Cheese, Lettuce, Roma Tomato & Sandwich Sauce) which was awesome although \"sandwich sauce\" sounded questionable haha. My friend had the Caribbean Jerk Chicken (Grilled Chicken, Roasted Red & Banana Peppers & Spicy Jerk Sauce) which unfortunately wasn't very flavorful. The The Full Montagu (Roasted Beef, Turkey, Swiss & Cheddar Cheese, Lettuce, Roma Tomato & Earl's Mustard) is good too.  I'd come back in a heartbeat!",

And when I say busy...it's a massive line.  But why come here?  Oh only because their holiday turkey sandwich is the best!  Imagine Thanksgiving incorporated into one sandwich....that's the holiday turkey sandwich.  Turkey, stuffing, gravy, and cranberry sauce sandwiched between two slices of perfectly cooked, crisp, freshly baked bread.  I don't even LIKE stuffing OR gravy...and I love this sandwich.

The lines moved rather quickly: 1.you order and a receipt is handed to you 2.move along the line, pay at the next register with anything you picked up along the way and you also order your cup for the fountain drinks at this register. They hand you another receipt and a buzzer. 3. When your buzzer buzzes pick up your sandwich next to the paid register. The only thing I wanted more of was the meat! There was hardly any meat in The Full Montagu. It's not something I would go back for or crave for but  is something light and close by that I can grab when at Planet Hollywood. It's good enough to fill me for an hour or two. Something to try but not a must.",

The sandwiches are really reasonably price like $6 to $7 dollars a sandwich and they are  really good, will  help sober you up a little too:).  They use this really good chabata bread and the meats are fresh!! I had some kind of earl sandwich with turkey.bacon, cheese and the usual veggies and stuff.  This location in Planet Hollywood was good and so was the one  at the Palms.  (had the albacore at that one really delish. Cant go wrong if you want a quick bite.!!",

The line was a little long but worth the wait! I honestly don't think this place is ever dead because it's open 24 hours and has great food!  I ordered the \"all american\" sandwich and the tomato bisque soup. My boyfriend ordered the chicken chipotle sandwich, which apparently is a limited time only sandwich. Priced fairly well for Vegas (around $6 a sandwich) and we both referred to the size of the sandwiches being like a brick. Both of us loved the portion and freshness of the sandwich, made to order, and I loved my soup! The soup has homemade croutons inside and the sandwich had all my favorites (turkey, lettuce, tomato, cheese) and also cranberries! It added a sweetness to the sandwich but very good toasted with the other ingredients. My boyfriend's sandwich was also good, the chipotle sauce giving the chicken a nice flavor.   I'm a little sad I won't be able to find one of these back home in AZ but am hopeful for the day it makes it here! Definitely check this place out when you're hungry and in Vegas baby!",

We got in around 10 pm on a Friday night and boy was it traffic, but we maneuvered our way through all that and parked at the Miracle Mile parking lot.  My brother and I circled our way through the mall and landed smack dab at the Earl of Sandwich.  I had already done some research and looked through the other yelp reviews since there's like over a thousand already. We ordered: the full montague, the all-american, the caribbean jerk chicken, the tuna melt, and broccoli and cheese soup.  I'd have to say I liked the tuna melt and the all-american the best.    Best things about this place: *open 24 hours *the bread on the sandwiches *the cool golden wrappers  *again it's open 24 hours - I love it! * The price isn't too bad either: $6-7 per sandwich.  Definitely have to go back here when I go back to Vegas.",

I was craving a good tuna melt, and from the photos on Earl's website, it looked like I was in for a huge, delicious sandwich.  Not the case.  There was barely enough tuna on my sandwich to give it even a slight tuna flavor.  The bread was the main thing I tasted.  Definately not the double-layer of tuna depicted on their website.  For $6.49, I felt I was overcharged.    To top it off, when I was done, I showed the photo of the tuna melt from their website to the Manager (Marc).  He said \"they sure make it look big on the website, obviously they're making it look like a lot more than it is\".  He then simply offered me a \"sorry boss\" and then turned and walked away, no offer to remake my sandwich, refund my money, maybe comp me a brownie or anything.  Left with a bad taste in my mouth.  Oh, and to top it off, they were repairing the floors in the seating area, and the workers were using blowtorches to heat up the vinyl flooring (looks like wood, but it's vinyl).  It gave off noxious odors while I was eating at one of the two available tables.  I definately won't be in any hurry to return, I've had much better sandwiches at the Carnegie Deli in Vegas, and at Gaglione Bros. subs in San Diego!",

They had a hot chicken florentine sandwich of some kind that was delicious, but they discontinued it (I assume - unless it was just a dream). Recently I visited the strip and went back to Earl during a shopping spree. I'm a devoted Capriotti's fan, in particular of their famous bobbie, so I ordered the \"holiday turkey\" sandwich at Earl thinking it would be similar. My god. I can't actually say it's better than the bobbie because that feels blasphemous, but it was SO GOOD. I thought adding gravy to the sandwich would make it sloppy and gross, but no. It was amazing. It melted in my mouth. All the flavors. All the stuffing. So good. I can't really judge this place apart from the only 2 sandwiches I've ever had there. This location is hidden in the Planet Hollywood casino, making the trek to find it difficult. I also don't know if I'd seek this spot out if I wasn't already shopping nearby, since I hate going on the strip...",

I on the other hand devoured the original 1762 (hot roast beef with cheddar cheese) and literally thought about buying another one. Portions are a little smaller, i inhaled that sucker in a couple minutes. Prices are fairly high for a sandwich joint, I spent about 12 bucks for a sandwich and drinks.

Planet Hollywood is smart, because this is one of the only reasons I make a trip over (I guess also, because Planet Hollywood is the only place I'm ever up in blackjack, but that's besides the point).  My go-to sandwich is always the Caprese sandwich, and I add turkey to it (still gotta have my meat!).  It is less than $10 I believe (I think it's like - $6 for the sandwich alone, and like $2-3 for the added meat) but man, the bread is delicious, the balsamic is awesome, and I have a soft spot in my heart for fresh mozzarrella.  LOVE. Also, their potato salad is pretty tasty too, but small portions, so beware if you want to share, because you might just end up with about 2 bites.  I want to go back to Vegas now just thinking about the deliciousness that is Earl of Sandwich, mmmmmmmm....",

It's nice to find a place on the Strip that has very fair priced sandwiches that are also delicious. All the sandwiches are priced $5.99. I actually have to say this was one of the best sandwiches I've had. The secret is in the bread. All their bread rolls are same for all their sandwiches and I'm not sure what kind it is, but it tasted almost biscuit-like. I got the Caribbean Jerk chicken sandwich, which had great flavor with tender chicken and also the banana peppers. The Full Montagu and the Original were also quite tasty. Everything came toasty and hot and why shouldn't it? They advertise their sandwiches as the world's best hot sandwich. A hot sandwich makes all the difference sometimes (actually the bread also makes all the difference). And hey, how can you argue with someone whose family has been making sandwiches for 250 years? I'm not sure if that story is actually True, but I hope this place opens more franchises in California!",

Since I don't really remember what everyone else got (there were about 14 of us) I'll just say that my Earl's Club with avocado and Tomato Soup was awesome. All of the ingredients tasted fresh and the avocado was actual avocado pieces, not avocado mush. My sandwich was also perfectly toasted and had just the right amount of mayo. The tomato soup was also a nice complement to my entire meal.  The only downside was that the coffee from one of the dispensers was cold. However, the other dispenser was still pretty warm, so Cam and I drank from that one. I was just really craving some coffee.",

Do people overrate how good it is because they have it when they're drunk and starving after a night of drinking/partying? It's open 24/7 and not exorbitantly expensive, so I guess it's pretty convenient.   I tried the ham egg and cheddar breakfast sandwich. Pretty good. I like the bread they use.  Also tried the Full Montague. It was alright. Although I didn't try it fresh/hot because I ordered it to pack for a hiking lunch so by the time I ate it it was cold. It was good, but not as amazing I thought it would be considering people speak of it so highly.   Tried the sugar cookie. THREE dollars. Not cheap. Their baked goods aren't cheap. The sugar cookie is good but super oily- I felt so guilty after I read it.  Red velvet cupcake is good but not amazing.   The tomato soup is good and comes with croutons. Again- good but not the best tomato soup I've ever had. Chicken noodle soup is...okay.   Overall this place is alright to me. But I'd come again considering how expensive everything else is on the Strip. (I just bought a grande frappe at Starbucks without looking at the menu prices and it ended up costing me $7.57, WHAT!?)",

    "text": "Take my word for it when I say you can never go wrong with a sandwich from here. It's simply just a sandwich; which beats me how they make it to be so appetizing and scrumptious. I got The Full Montagu and it was mouthwateringly good. Roast beef, Turkey, Swiss, Cheddar, Roma Tomatoes, and Mustard to top it off. I would say if compared to Ike's Sandwiches, it's not as heavy and saucy, however just the right size and enough to satisfy your sandwich cravings. There's also not too much going on inside with just the basics of everything you would normally see in sandwiches. For roughly $7 a sandwich, there's nothing close that beats the quality and affordability that Earl of Sandwich offers. Along with my sandwich, I always have to get a small cup of their Tomato Soup because it's seriously one of the best Tomato Soups I've ever had. It's creamy, flavorful, and I love that they have a few chunks of bread in there to add texture. Must try!!  Service is also quick as you get in line to order and after receiving your receipt and pager, you move to the end of the line to pay. Sandwiches are usually ready within 5-10 minutes of you ordering. Great place for a quick grub!",

Too much bread, not enough meat...but if you're carbo-loading or drunk, I guess that's a good thing.  The Original 1762: Roast beef, bacon, cheese, horseradish sauce. The flavor combinations were good. The saltiness from the beef and cheese plus, the nostril-burning sensation form the horseradish. 4.5/5  Tuna Melt: Albacore tuna salad & Swiss cheese. I only trust tuna sandwiches from a handful of places because I don't want a fishy and gross sandwich. 4/5  I've heard good things about the Montagu so, I'll try that next time.",

My hubs and I were craving a midnight snack though while in vegas so we walked over from Cosmo (super quick and easy!) and the line was non existent. We got the roast beef sandwich with tomato soup. Aside from the sandwich that's pretty amazing the TOMATO SOUP!! It has these humongous croutons that were crunchy but soaking up the creamy salty tomato soup and it was amazing. My only regret from this trip is that I didn't get more of that soup, damn free buffet at wicked spoon.  Anyway, it's cafeteria style you order, then they make you walk through the line of temptation with sides and drinks and dessert, then allow you to pay. Would come back here, a very cheap good eats place in vegas!",

This establishment is fine. There was a line, so obviously people love it. I wouldn't even have done a review if it wasn't for my unpleasant surprise... I didn't happen to be that hungry at the time we were in the area but once we got to the front of the line, I figured I should at least try something. I got a chicken bacon avocado wrap and I was looking forward to it. We were lucky enough to get a seat and my boyfriend dove into his sandwich. We were talking when I bit into my wrap and I actually spit it out all over the table. It was DRENCHED in balsamic vinegar! I didn't skip a beat...I jumped up and walked to the counter. I found my item again on the menu-board and indeed, the last ingredient listed was balsamic, so I have no one to blame but myself. It was pretty disgusting though and inedible so I had to toss it. It would have been fine without the vinegar all over it and I am not being dramatic that ot was an excessive amount. My boyfriend's Reuben was pretty darn good though so I would give it another try for a sandwich.",

    "text": "Came here for my first time. Those thousands of 5-star reviews did not steer me wrong!  I had the holiday turkey: turkey, cranberry, mayo, cornbread stuff, etc. on sourdough.  You order at one register and pay at the other. It was pretty crowded so just hang around to nab a seat at a table. They're sandwiches so the tables turn over pretty quickly.  Holiday turkey was so delicious with just the right balance of creaminess and sweetness from the cranberry. A generous amount of turkey means that for most appetites, one of those sandwiches will be more than enough!   Just make sure you eat fast because the wet ingredients (mayo, cranberry sauce, stuffing) soak the bread faster than normal.  I love that they wrap them in gold foil so you feel like you've got a gold bar in your hands.  A bit pricey, but part of it is the brand name and the hype. $8-9 bucks for a 6 inch or so sandwich but it's super dense and filling. Normally I wouldn't pay so much for a sandwich but it's a great iconic place to go and I would say the taste is worth it!   They really knocked the socks of this holiday turkey sandwich and I don't even like thanksgiving foods haha...  I will be returning!",

I went through the reviews and heard so much about the famous Montague so had to try it. It was tasty and overall good, however I expected it to have more of a wow factor. Not quite.. Wanted to try another one just to really have a 5 Star experience, but was too full. As for the service it was super fast and friendly, and organized. There is a variety of sandwiches and sides, and even deserts. So will definitely eat here again when visiting Vegas.",

The Earl Club:  - a basic yet filling turkey bacon sub  - nothing out of the ordinary  The Full Montagu: ***personal fav***  - roast beef and turkey is a great combo  - earl mustard makes sandwich even better Italian:  - an awesome hearty sandwich  - very bold and savory pizza-like taste  All of the sandwiches come on their special artisan baked loaf which reminded me of a lighter more luscious ciabatta. the desserts were extremely tempting but i was too excited to try the variety of sandwiches we ordered.  its hard to find a cheap yet delicious establishment along the strip so when we came across this place we were pleasantly surprised. the storefront and staff were well kept making it more inviting to sample their delicious sandwiches. not only was the storefront and staff presentable but the wrapping of the sandwich was like no other. the light gold foil coated the sandwich perfectly.   visuals + taste + price = awesome * 10",

The sandwiches are $5.95 and the soups are $2.95). Reasonably priced, especially for the Las Vegas strip.

Friends have recommended this place and I remembered that I wanted to try this place last time I was in Vegas last April but didn't make it =(  This trip we had last week, we came into town super late and I remembered that this place was still open.  The BF had ham and cheese sandwich and I had the broccoli cheddar soup.  Both came out piping hot which was refreshing because most of the time, you can't see steam from your food at that hour (1 AM).  The soup was made just right and not too cheesy and there's enough broccoli in there.  He paid no more than $10-$11 and it was full filling.  We were awed by this place that we came back the next day and I had The Full Montagu and he had The Earls Club.  Let me tell you that both were still good the next day for left overs =)",

Being that this is open 24 hours and also completely affordable (sandwiches are $6 and soups are $3), it became my go-to place for breakfast, lunch, dinner and post-drinking munchies (too bad I didn't always have my phone to check in haha).  During my 3 night stay in Vegas this past weekend...I came here for ALL of my meals (minus Pink's and a pizzeria) and still didn't get tired of it!  I've tried a few of their sandwiches (all were good), but my favorite has to be the tuna melt.  Being a tuna junkie, I can definitely say that not only is the tuna melt from Earl's my favorite sandwich on the menu, but it is probably my favorite tuna melt sandwich of all time!",

We got the Hawaiian BBQ sandwich in hopes that it wasn't too filling but damn - it was. And dammit, it tasted like a Hawaiian pizza which I was not in the mood for.   I do like the bread to food consistency as sometimes there is just WAY too much bread, and I like that it's a toasted sammich - always love a slight crisp to the tops of my bread.   Lastly, props for this place being one of the cheapest places on the strip to eat and for my next venture there, I'll make sure to order what their known for versus trying to eat something \"else\".",

I was pissed I pretty much was eating firkin bread and lettuce and tomato. I go to the cashier and ask how many ounces of meat they put in the sandwich they said 4 ounces. I asked her does this look like 4 ounces and she said well you ate some of it so it had to been. I didn't know a couple bite means I ate 4 ounces. Then she said would you like me to get the manager and I said yes, he apologized and made me a new sandwich but ugh did it take disgusting like all mayo and turkey. I really hope they change the quality to how it used to be. It was my favorite sandwich shop in Vegas.",

I honestly don't know what they do that makes it so good, because it just looks like that roll it through just any regular ole rolling toaster oven! Whatever they do, it works and it makes the sandwiches prety awesome.  The full montague was one of my faves.

You have to the Holiday sandwich first and foremost as it reminds me of thanksgiving with turkey, gravy, stuffing, and cranberry sauce. The Hawaiian BBQ is incredible as well and has chicken, ham, cheese, pineapples, and BBQ sauce. There is an amazing selections of sandwiches, salads, wraps, soups, and sides; all of which are made fresh when you order. They also have a phenomenal breakfast menu as well. A must try is the bacon, egg, and cheese on the artesian mini loaf. Oh yeah, and I forgot to mention, Earl of Sandwich also has some of the best cookies in town. If you're looking for a wrap, I recommend the Buffalo Chicken wrap. You won't be disappointed. Enjoy",

Sadly, I just realized that I should have taken the OTHER side of the Miracle Mile Mall's entrance (south side of the Miracle Mile Mall's entrance, near the intersection of Harmon Ave and Las Vegas Blvd).   The Full Montagu (roasted beef, turkey, Swiss, cheddar, lettuce, tomato & mustard sauce - $6.49):  The bread was perfectly toasted - fluffy and fresh. Flavorful roasted beef combined with amazing toasted bread = one delicious sandwich.  Affordable and tasty sandwich shop that opens 24/7? That's probably one of the best thing that you can find at the Strip.",

I had heard that this place was THE BESTTTT sandwich ever but when I received my order, I was like, \"Is that it?\"  Small portion, inflated unjustified prices, and quality was average. The sandwich wasn't bad, but there was nothing spectacular, nothing out of this world. I've had Safeway sandwiches that were better.   Maybe I didn't order the right thing? But when you're the \"BEST\" it doesn't matter what someone orders, because every item will reflect that it's the best- and this did not. Eh. Never again.",

The bread is toasted to have the perfect crunch and they are not cheap on their meat.    At times the line may be long, but it moves quickly.

We decided we had to hit Burgr also just to make the trip \"worth\" it, but I can tell you, the All American itself accomplished that.   The eating environment leaves something to be desired, but the execution of the American was perfect: a nice blend of savory turkey, melted cheese, fresh lettuce and tomatoes, with an added dimension of sweetness, thanks to the cranberries. The ingredients are neatly arranged without the bread getting soggy or the flavors ever getting lost. How do they do it?   I don't think the concept of a hot sandwich is that novel (I literally never eat cold sandwiches, but that could be because I'm Asian?), and so the 5-star rating I'm giving surprises even myself.

    "text": "Lets just say I love this place just as much as the next fan does.  Its amazing!   Right in the heart of the Planet Hollywood hotel sits this cheap ($5.99 per sandwich) little shop pumping out sandwiches as fast as they can.   I rocked the \"Cannonballs\"(meatball) and the \"Hawaiian\" (bbq chx) sandwiches and was overly impressed at how simple and amazing these were.   The reason that is doesn't get the 5th star from me is a matter of simple economics.  \"If the line is long, prices are too low!\"  This place fits that phrase exactly.  Its possible to see a 100-150 person line at 3am at this place!!!  Even with a fast moving line, lunch still took around 45 minutes to get!  They should really consider raising their prices just a tad...even just $1 or $2 a sandwich because its a little obnoxious that the only affordable place around that hotel is so crowded.",

I have also enjoyed their Classic Roast Beef, Veggie, and Tuna Melt.    I doubt you can go wrong w/ any of their sandwiches!  You can totally get stuffed one sandwich or share one w/ a friend.  Their fruit is pretty fresh.  I didn't like their Mac salad though! :(  Their cookies were delicious! Nom Nom Nom!  They are now open 24 hours and serve breakfast!  Too bad I don't like breakfast!    This place is a great place for something a lil more on the healthier side esp if you had been blinge drinking!   The sandwiches don't give you that heavy sinking stomach feeling!

The line to order took about 20 minutes. Maybe they should let her go and put someone else. Anyways, other than that i definitely say you try it if you're balling on a budget in vegas!",

    "text": "With 1,320+ reviews at 4.5/5 stars --though in my opinion, deserves more --, does it live up to the hype?  Absolutely!  First time I tasted Earl's sandwiches was at Downtown Disney in Florida.  After an exhausting all-day visit at Magic Kingdom, we decided to call it the day but not before heading to Downtown Disney where we discovered this gem and became a believer that there is a sandwich maker who would topple the likes of Quiznos, Togos and all the others.  At last, a sandwich establishment worth writing about.  My very first Earl sandwich was the Rueben and it was delectable (I don't think they still have it on the menu) ; made me forget the whole day of walking that I endured.  From that day, I vowed to seek this establishment back home in California but quickly discovered its non-existence. Sad days indeed.  Then one day I was relieved when I heard that Las Vegas opened up a franchise.   On my much anticipated return last month, I indulged on the goodness of The Full Montagu and Tuna Melt.  Both of which are hot sandwiches and are scrumptious. Did it live up to the hype once, twice, thrice, etc?  Abso-Earlutely...   A satisfying end to a weekend Vegas getaway.",

Pros: - Middle of the strip located on the Las Vegas Blvd of the strip in Planet Hollywood - $5.99 sandwiches, which means it'll probably be the cheapest meal you eat in Vegas - Around the corner from Fat Tuesday - Not a long wait AT ALL when I came at 6PM on a Sunday - AMAZING, YUMMY SANDWICHES - Open 24 hours   I ordered the Full Montagu because Yelp told me it was one of their best ones and for once, Yelp didn't lie.  It was AMAZING.  So good and everyone in my group of 7 said it was one of the best sandwiches they've ever had in their life.  We were with one local who bought 2 and while at first we thought she was just being a fatty, when we all got back to the hotel, we ALL were wishing we had bought an extra one.  Earl of Sandwich, I'm coming back to you EVERY SINGLE TIME. Hell, it makes me want to stay in Planet Hollywood the next time I go to Vegas just so that it's much more conveniently located.

Being that it was my first time there, I tried \"The Original,\" roast beef and cheddar cheese.  I thought because I was in a casino, this sandwich shop would be overpriced, but to my surprise, it is actually quite affordable if not a steal.  Not knowing anything about this sandwich shop, I was just expecting a roast beef sandwich with cheese, but when I opened the bag and pulled the sandwich out, it was warm.  Undoing the wrapper, I could start smelling the goodness.  The warm cheddar cheese oozing out of the sandwich.  I took my first bite and it was the highlight of that evening.  I added the spicy mustard on the table and quickly we were in business.  Now could it be that I was a little inebriated and anything I ate could have been delicious? Totally possible.  Looking at the other reviews for this place, I'd hedge my bets on total deliciousness.  You can't ask for more from this sandwich stand.  It's in a convenient location offering affordable fare.  Will I return?  Yes, I already have! 5 stars for the food, location, affordability and convenience.",

The sandwich is a decent size, enough to fill you up for a meal. The ingredients are fresh and the bread is toasted to perfection!   My favorite is the All American - juicy roasted turkey with sweet cranberry sauce, cheese, lettuce, tomatoes on a perfectly toasted roll. I also heard the Full Montagu is amazing.   There can be a line at times, but it's worth the wait! There's ample seating in the area.   I highly recommend Earls if you're in Vegas!

My girlfriend got the Earls Club and she thought the sandwich was flavorful but was lacking in the onions and pickles department. This is why she would rather give this a 3 star.

With our hangovers in desperate need of some meat and bread, we grabbed a cab to Planet Hollywood and Earl of Sandwich.  I never thought of a sandwich as something that needed to be \"invented\"... How hard is it to see, bread, meat, bread?   Supposedly, the same family of the original sandwich inventor owns this sandwich chain... I was unsure until I bit into my Full Montagu. Delicious!  The bread was great. The meat was piled just high enough, not too obnoxious and not too skimpy. The condiments and veggies were just the right touch. Definitely worth the cab ride up.   Another bonus: their menu, no matter the sandwich, is all the same price. Slightly more expensive than Subway and way less expensive than Quiznos!",

If you're only going to give me one thin slice of meat on each half of my small sandwich, at least lay it flat so that it looks like more.  The bread was crispy but thin.

    "text": "Earl's is the homie. Here in vegas, Earl of Sandwich is another place that people talk about non-stop and bombard my facebook news feed with their pictures. I always thought it looked good and wanted to try it. So when you're broke from too much gambling and don't have the money to eat at the buffets, Earl's is my suggestion for you! Kind of expensive for a sandwich, but also pretty filling and might I add, delicious! I had the full montague and the italian and I like both. I even saved half for a little midnight snack and even after a couple of hours it was still SO GOOD. Definitely check this place out but prepare to stand in line for at least a good 20 mins before getting to order, and have someone save some seats for you!",

They are all pretty good but the Full Montagu is definitely the best. The only downside is that the sandwiches are a bit small, but its open 24 hours and its definitely a great snack at an odd hour of the night. And you have the delightful ambiance of the Planet Hollywood on top of all that.",

They were all awesome.  My wife (who isn't even a big fan of sandwiches) took one bite that quickly followed with her eyes opening up wide and just saying \"wow.\"  She then followed by asking \"how the hell did they do that?\"  There's a reason why there's always a line and bit of a wait, but for the shear volume of customers they have they do a good job of not making you wait too long to enjoy one of their great creations.",

Naturally the ridiculously expensive food doesn't make things any better, especially if you're like my group of friends that likes to do (at least) one get-all-fancied-up dinner and a buffet or two. Plus that entire smorgasboard of alcohol everywhere...what's the point in paying 10+ for lunch? That could be your next double down. Or perhaps a last minute all-on-red.   Now Earl's is a life-saver. It's great sandwiches...I mean delicious when you're non-alchied, and even delicious-er when you're nicely alchied up. I got the Montagu, roast beef, turkey, brie, mmmm. And it's all for less than 6 bucks!!! LESS THAN 6 BUCKS. I was so amazed. This is much better than blowing 30+ at Serendipitys for lunch. (They're great for dessert, not so much on food). It's right outside Planet Hollywood casino, which has Prive...one of the better clubs and sometimes decent tables. They were not so loving this last weekend though.   Anyway, go to Earl's for hangover food. Go to Earls for lunch, go to Earl's for late night munchies, and go to Earl's to sit down and get all those gamblin' jitters out of your system before you go back and blow next week's paycheck too.",

The bread is so fluffy and light, which I'm grateful for because I'm not a big bread fan, if I have to eat a sandwich, it will usually be wrapped in lettuce or I'll just strip it naked!  The blend of tuna and cheese is delicious; the entire sandwich fits well together.  My bf got the Salami or something like that but he loved it!  I also tried their Tomato Basil soup and Chicken Tortilla soup; and both are really tastey!  If you're a big soup fan like I am, I definitely recommend complimenting your sandwich with a soup.   The first time I had Earl of Sandwich was in Anaheim in Downtown Disney, but for some reason, I didn't remember if I liked it or not. This location in Vegas however, left me craving for more my entire trip! I wish we had gotten more.   All and all, I highly recommend trying Earl of Sandwich.",

Especially b/c you're in Vegas and nothing is cheap here!  But if this place were in my neighborhood, it would be a solid 3-4 star sandwich joint.

Even though it was breakfast time, I had seen a friend of mine eat a hot sandwich from here the day before and I couldn't resist ordering one. I got the chipotle chicken avocado and it was DIVINE! Great combination of ingredients! Staff was efficient and friendly and even though there was a line the wait wasn't long. This place is open 24/7 so you can always count on it anytime of the day!",

I feel like you're there at all hours when I need you - the delicious deli sandwiches grilled for crispy bread and gooey cheese is pure perfection.  Even when the lines are long, I wait it out because I know you're worth it and I'll never be disappointed.  That's why every time I'm in Vegas I know I have to make the effort to see you at least once :)",

Just the way I like my sandwiches. $7, son! You can't go wrong with the Full Montagu. It's a True classic. Melted cheese...MMMM!  I wholeheartedly believe their story of creating the original sandwich. Farfetched? Yes. Does it matter? Not really. Their craftsmanship is impeccable yet simple. The Earl of Sandwich has truly earned his spot in history, and he deserves a Nobel Prize for Good Eats.  The line is crazy, though, no matter what time you're there. Seems like everyone and their grandma is a fan. It's located right next to the slot machines in Planet Hollywood, so it's a high traffic area.   I always get 5 or 6 sandwiches to-go and bring them on the plane ride back home. They're that fantastic.",

I wasn't overly impressed with it then and I'm not now. The sandwiches here are hot and greasy and I understand how they can certainly hit the spot at 3AM after a wild Vegas night, but over 3000 4.5 star reviews? Me thinks not. I suppose a lot of people that come to Vegas are from the middle of nowhere, USA so perhaps they haven't had the honor of meeting the Earl, I however, am not so easily impressed. 3 stars for the convenience of the hours and the affordable price. If this is your first or possibly only time in Vegas, I would skip this place for sure.",

This location in Planet Hollywood is open 24/7 so it is super convenient being it is the center of the strip! I had the Earl club and it was so good! The 4 of us was only like $40 and good food compared to McDonalds or burger king! I was somewhat disapointed that the sandwiches were $6-7 each and they were small.

I mean where else can you get a legit panini-type sandwich that tastes like heaven at an odd hour of the evening/morning for less than $10...while tipsy...  I've had the Full Montagu and Chipotle Chicken Avocado - both of which are great choices (thanks yelp friends that suggested!). The Chipotle Chicken Avocado I appreciated for the light spiciness and fresh avocado, and the full montagu for their roast beef. Earl of Sandwich is just so satisfying at any point in the day/evening in Vegas and it's definitely going to be a regular for me for all of my Vegas trips!",

Out of nowhere two gargantuan couple comes waltzing in front of me and orders. Literally cuts the line and the cashier doesn't say anything. This happens again when my boyfriend and his group of friends was up when three other guys comes up to them, tries to use a \"Have you seen my phone\" ruse to cut in line. The cashier once again can see that the three guys were not there beforehand, yet decides to stay silent. Thank goodness the group decides to walk around them to order.  What pissed me off was we tried telling management about it, it's not fair to all the other people waiting in line. The response they gave: they merely shrugged their shoulders and said \"okay\". #WTF. They could've at least put line cutters on last or something. They didn't even seem to care that it was bothering other customers.  Not to mention their service is terribly slow. We watched the only sandwich cutter take his sweet time cutting the sandwiches as other sandwiches piled up in the oven (since it's on a conveyor belt). It ended up being burnt. -_-  If it wasn't for the fact that this was the closet place to cheap eats near Vdara, probably wouldn't come here again.",

You'll probably end up buying more than one to feel full. Thankfully, the staff is super fast and the intimidating line really isn't a problem. The sandwich itself was really good though.

LET'S GO TO VEGAS!\"  Upon hearing about this highly raved hot sandwich place called \"Earl of Sandwich\", which floods my facebook news feed statuses and pictures on a biweekly basis, the thought of feeling deprived and naive to what great concoctions this joint produced bothered me. How could this place been unbeknownst to me after several Vegas trips over the course of two years?! Obviously- I have been living under a rock.  Fresh, piping hot sandwiches that are wrapped in a gold foil, where the unwrapping of this decadent sandwich parallels to the experience of unwrapping a Wonka bar, as you await to see if you may be the lucky one to claim the golden ticket. Except in this case, everyone is a winner since each shiny wrapped golden foiled item will behold an experience where each unfolding of the wrap heightens your excitement to devour this melt in your mouth goodness. Win win!   How much did I like this place? Maybe a little too much to the extent where I actually went two days in a row (aka. the length of my trip); however, this granted me the opportunity to try not one or two different sandwiches, but THREE! TRES! Read this clearly. Yes I HEIFER!!! Moooo.  I wish I could pick one, but all three sandwiches were divine! The Earl's Club, a sandwich comprised of thinly sliced roasted turkey that tastes as if it were fresh out of the deli, layered with crispy pieces of Smoked Bacon goodness, Aged Swiss that oozes and clings to the bread and your mouth  for some good cheese action, offset with some refreshing pieces of Lettuce, Roma Tomatoes amongst a slathering of Good Burger like secret sauce. Oooo willy. I can only imagine how delicious it would be to consume this right now at 8:30am.   Cannonballs! So I'm a meat girl and I distinctively remembering a huge hankering for some meat during my last night in sin city. What better way to satisfy this craving with a sandwich full of meatballs cushioned with rich, saucy marinara sauce with melted mozzarella cheese & Parmesan?! Dudes and Dudettes- this hit THE spot.   Now, even though all three sandwiches were beyond delicious, there was one that distinctively stands out. The tantalizing, TUNA MELT!  Perhaps it was the fact that there was no lack of oozing aged Swiss or because the Albacore tuna salad was beyond rich and divine, but the combination of the two simply highlighted this standard diner special to the point beyond oo so ump dittily scrumptious, giving me a lasting euphoria of tuna melt heaven for several hours.   I swear. This place is the go-to spot for a quick lunch or for a late night post clubbing snack since the place is open 24/7. If you haven't tried this place yet, please do yourself a favor and throw that rock off your back and stampede your way to Earls'  because I'm ever so glad that I did.",

Price is right, service is quick, food is fresh, seating is a challenge but it would be since the Earl of Sandwich rocks. P.S. Long lines move quickly.  P.S. Trust drunk friends to recommend this because this is awesome when your drunk. Trust sober friends because it's pretty friggen tasty when your sober too.",

I also tried the french dip.  It was alright.  That particular one, though, needed more flavor.  I guess I don't have to keep coming to Vegas just to eat here.  See above.

I just wish it had some mashed potatoes in it also. Highly recommended for those who love Thanksgiving fare.  Definitely worth the $12 taxi ride from the Wynn.

I got the Earl's club sandwich with bacon and turkey. The bread was fantastic, seemed fresh baked. It just came together really well. And it cost $8 and change, so I didn't feel guilty or robbed.  The menu is diverse and you'll likely have trouble choosing. Not only sandwiches, they also have wraps, salads, cookies, brownies, and such.  The sandwiches that looked the best to me were the club, the pastrami Reuben, and the Thanksgiving sandwich...Planet Hollywood sucks, but it may be worth swinging in to grab a sandwich. Oh, and unlike the hotel in which it resides...free wifi.",

The sandwiches aren't all greased out so they feel relatively healthy to eat and you don't feel gross afterwards. Sometimes I'll get a side of Broccoli Cheese Soup w/ my meal. The soup is really good, but nothing special.  There's a long line? Not uncommon. Just suck it up and get in line.

But order your sandwich, get a buzzer, find a seat and wait for it to be ready. They pack it to go, but we were lucky to find a seat for 6 people and ate there before our 5 hour drive back to SD.

Pros:  -6.50 a steaming hot sandwich after tax and it located right on the strip. -The service is speedy, all the ingredients taste fresh -Way better than Quizno's, Subways and Capriotti's combined.  Quiznos and subway gives way too little meat and Capriotti's is a bit more expensive and takes longer to make.  Earls is hot, fresh and has a good amount of meat in them.  :)  Everyone I know who's tried this place loves it! :) (That means not just the drunks who stumble upon this place but local sober friends continue to come back as well )  If you dont give this place a try, you are missing out! :)",

It turns out they do and it consists of lettuce, tomato, avocado, black beans, cheese, and Italian dressing. I'm glad I asked! It was just what I was looking for at the time, and made even better by toasting it. At around $7, it was a great, inexpensive lunch.",

The line was pretty long when I arrived and the place was crowded. Since it was my first time ordering, I asked the cashier for recommendations and he suggest the Chipotle avocado with chicken. It was definitely the best choice I made within my 3 day stay.   The sandwich was nicely presented in a yellow/ gold wrapper with a sticker (not that that matters). The  sandwich itself was delicious. The bread was warm and crispy and the avocados looked very green and fresh. The chicken was moist and the overall texture + taste was incredible. The portion was decent size for its price. It was about $6-$7. My boyfriend on the other hand ordered an italian sub if I remember correctly. But mine was definitely much better than his.   Pros: Fast service, great staff, great food Cons: None as of now.",

Thank god we beat the lunch rush case when we finished eating the line was looong.  I got the Earls Club and my friend got the Full Montague. The Earls club was just your typical sandwich, the ingredients inside didnt blow my mind and I'd probably choose Togo's turkey avocado sandwich over this one. The Full Montague was better, it was meatier and had a more flavorful sauce. I felt the warm and yummy bread for the sandwiches was more standout than the contents. My total came out to be around 6.50.  Though I've had better sandwiches in the past, this one is a great option for a cheap place to eat on the strip (located inside planet hollywood).",

Turkey, cranberry sauce, avocado. It would have been better with dutch crunch bread, but never the less still very good. Also got Earl's lemonade. Very different, tasted like an arnold palmer with a different type of tea, but also very refreshing!  Second time there, I was so hungry I got 2 sandwiches. Was more disappointed this time around. i got the full montague, was very similar to the all american, but with roast beef and without the cranberry sauce. I probably should have known better since I don't like roast beef, but I figured if everyone was getting it, it probably was worth it. sorry Earl, it's not you, it's me so I didn't take of stars for it. Also ordered a breakfast sandwich (egg, bacon and pepper jack) that was a bit too bland for my liking.  It's ok Earl, I'll still come back for your All American and your lemonade.",

    "text": "A 24 hour cheap hot sandwich place is a vegas jackpot!!!  I always find myself having sandwich cravings and i'd been spending weeks looking at the reviews. I had decided way before i stepped into the store at PH, that i would be ordering the Full Montagu- Roast beef and turkey!!!  <a href=\"http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/DkYS3arLOhA8si5uUEmHOw?select=pqiqUiWVESs9LubdKK2zcw\">yelp.com/biz_photos/DkYS...</a> We were still full from breakfast, so i didn't get to try a second sandwich as i had hoped (i'm definitely getting the canonball meatball sammie next time). I'm sure after i try a few more different sammies here, i would upgrade to a 5, but based on just the one i had, i just needed a little something more. More mayonaisy sauce? Avocado? Not sure. But i am not craving it, as i do with Cooks, Mendo, Caps or Langers. But... I will be back for sure to get the cannonball and get ANOTHER brownie whoopie pie !! <a href=\"http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/DkYS3arLOhA8si5uUEmHOw?select=DbdvnjAtWRE2Hj0_MbX26Q\">yelp.com/biz_photos/DkYS...</a>",

He said he would pay for us if we don't like it. So it was a win win situation.  . It was pretty good but it's definitely not the best I've had. I guess it depends on what you get. I ordered their Veggie sandwich. Bread was good but sauce could use a little more flavor. Still, it was a good deal. $6 for an oversized sandwich at Vegas.

The sauces that they put on their sandwiches are great and it's very good for their price point- it's pretty difficult to find a place on the strip that will feed you lunch or dinner and leave you full for about $10.   My slight gripe is the meat to bread ratio- I'd love more meat.",

After about 10 minutes, our sandwiches were ready and man, after one bite, could I  understand where that exclamation point came from! The meatballs were delicious and they were sliced in half so twas easy to eat. Their marinara sauce perfectly complemented the meatballs and the bread was nice and toasty.   Definitely come by here if you've got the munchies whether while gambling or after a long night out. There's bound to be something that'll catch your eye!",

    "text": "I'm not a big sandwich fan, but my friends wanted to eat here so I gave it a shot (being super hungry helped too).  We ordered the Earl's Club and were told that the wait would be about 40 minutes long. We were able to find seats and before we knew it our sandwiches were ready. The bread was toasty to perfection, the ratio between meat and veggies was perfect and their sauce and cheese complimented the sandwich very well. I tried using the mustard they provided, but I realized after a few horrible bites that their mustard really overpowers the taste of the sandwich. I opted to eat my 2nd half of the Earl's Club plain and it was muuchhh yummier left alone.  The second day I was starving again so I ran over to Earl's to grab a sandwich again. This time we ordered the Full Montagu and it was definitely a great sandwich. Unlike the Earl's Club which was a bit salty, the Full Montagu was much more balanced in terms of flavoring and it was seriously a great delight. I'd definitely recommend getting the Full Montagu and dripping on some of the Tabasco sauce they have at the tables. I'm literally drooling as I write this review thinking about these sandwiches.  Overall, Earl's was definitely worth the visits and at 5.99 per sandwich, you can't really go wrong. The service is pretty fast considering how many people there are waiting for food. This place is how ALL sandwiches should taste! Swing by if you're around the area by Planet Hollywood!!!",

    "text": "Just how good is an Earls Sandwich?? Short answer is, yes friends, it is good and you should try it!  The long answer of it all is that it will not be as ridiculously amazing as everyone hypes it up to be on yelp, but it is unarguably a good and delicious sandwich. What makes an Earls sandwich even better is that everything is made fresh to order, its available 24/7, and in a city where all your money goes to dealers, alcohol and strippers, you'll certainly appreciate the affordability of an Earls sandwich to fill that hungry belly.  My two personal favorites here are The Full Montagu and Tuna Melt. But there isn't exactly a wrong choice of sandwiches here. I've tried The Original 1762, Earl's Club, Caribbean Jerk Chicken, All American, Ham n Swiss, Caprese, and Italian and while some taste better than others, they're all in the end very good. Also if you have some spare change in your pocket, I really recommend Earl's Slaw -- crisp and refreshing and not bogged down with too much mayo. Chocolate chip cookies here are really good too--it's the giant, soft, chewy kind, yum!!  So my advice to future Earl-goers, do come with an expectation of getting a delicious sandwich, but don't expect the sandwich of a lifetime.",

It was nothing special and I would not come back here or recommend it to anyone. I tried the full montagu and it was alright. I stole a few bites from the tuna melt (decent) and the original (pretty good) but the only lasting impression is their mustard spread and horseradish sauce. The tomato soup tastes like it was warmed up from a can. Also, my sister was in the mood for something simple and got the grilled cheese, it was like a roll of bread and the tiniest amount of cheese. Way too much bread. The Mac and cheese is good even though the way it's packaged reminded me of airline food which made me not want to try it but I'm glad I did as that was one of the best things I ate there.",

I ordered two different sandwiches  The Earl's Club - Packed with flavor (and I'm sure sodium). So tasty...and of course, the bacon is a nice added bonus!  The Full Montagu - Really good sandwich too, but not as good as the Earl's Club.

    "text": "My first impression was (after hearing everyone and their moms rave about the sandwiches), \"Really, a sandwich? How amazing can a sandwich really be?\"  The answer is: it was AMAZING.  A-ll the rave really exists for a reason. Located in Planet Hollywood, you could easily pass by this place not knowing its grand existence if you weren't aware of their famous sandwiches. But once you try it you might be so impressed you won't know how to react.  M-eat meat meat. The roasted beef was a shocker to my mouth. How could something that looks so simple taste so smooth and delicious? Perfectly soft, perfectly chewy, and just enough flavor that only an Earl's can achieve.  A-nd after all that I was thrown off by another memorable discovery. The bread. Warm, crispy on the outside, chewy on the inside, and the most perfectly toasted crust gently surrounding the outsides of my sandwich.  Z-ero complaints.  I-n Vegas, the party goes on...all night long. That's why they're open 24 hours for your eating pleasure.  N-ext time I'm in Vegas, I am stocking up! Great to have on the roadtrip back home. Does anyone know how I can preserve these babies so I can have a stash of them to eat until my next trip to Vegas?  G-oogle image \"Earl of Sandwich\" and you will see a man named Earl Montagu who apparently \"invented\" the sandwich. Fun fact, the 11th Earl of Sandwich still operates this empire!  The lasting impression? \"First thing to eat when I go to Vegas, last thing to eat before I leave Vegas.\"",

    "text": "For Vegas, Earl's is an absolute gem. Opened 24 hours AND toasty, tasty sammies? Perfect anecdote/joint to end/start? your 4:00 am debaucheries ;)  I love Earl's Turkey Club Sandwich -- it's not only a safe sandwich but it's really good and fulfilling. The bread is AMAZING; it's toasted to perfection and it doesn't scratch up your gums.  Earl's bread has the right amount of crispy crunch and soft dough to compliment the contents of the sandwich.  Everything else seems fresh but I wasn't exactly BLOWN away.  Like I said, for Vegas, yes, this is damn good. I've had better sandwiches in the OC and LA in California BUT I'll give it to Earl's for being the best in Sin City.  Tried the Full Montagu (beef, turkey, cheddar/swiss cheese, etc.) and it was good, but not my fave. Solid sandwich, though.  Also, their Tomato Bisque -- UM, AMAZING.  I felt so sick after my Vegas trip and had to have soup at Earl's. Best decision during my trip, EASY. Their garlic croutons added the perfect kick to the tomato flavor (which tasted so homey, omg). Rich and slightly creamy... perfect for the weak stomach :)  **Accepts credit cards **Tucked away in Planet Hollywood, across from The Sugar Factory **Open 24/7!! **Long line but don't be discouraged, it goes by really fast.",

    "text": "Great sandwiches at a low price. It's so refreshing to find a place that is light on the wallet without being light on the taste. Breakfast, sandwiches, soups, salads, desserts and beverages. What else could you ask for?   Breakfast was $3.99 for an egg, cheddar, and ham sandwich on  warm, soft, toasted bread. The bread really makes their sandwiches.   Lunch we had the creamy tomato soup ($3.99) which was great. It really was creamy with a nice amount of herbs, garlic and croutons. For sandwiches we tried the Italian (awesome), the club (great), the Full Montagu (good), and the Caprese (tasty, but not my favorite compared to the others). $5.99 for those.  Once again, the bread makes it.  What's really cool is everything is packaged to go (including the soup) so it's easy to carry back to the room or to find a place to sit as they have quite a bit of seating.  For tasty, cheap eats, this is a must stop.",

If so, then you probably won't be disappointed with this place. They offer breakfast, salads, well as some side items (soups, mac 'n cheese, etc.), and a bunch of dessert options.   I ordered the only vegetarian option on the menu (the caprese sandwich) and thought it was simply ok. Really nothing to write home about. I suppose given the other options in this price point it's a good place but I can't say I'll be returning.",

    "text": "The Earl of Sandwich was a disappointment for me especially since I had heard so many good things. To me this place is a hyped up Quiznos and I'm not a lover of Quiznos. So let me lay our my reasons for this two star rating...   I was in during lunch time mid-week so I was prepared for it to be a bit busy but I felt the line more very slow for the number of people ahead of me. The wait for the sandwich was ok but I still felt should have been shorter for the number of people ahead of me. I ordered the Thanksgiving theme turkey sandwich because it was the only sandwich that appealed to me from the menu options.   The sandwich itself was lack-luster at best for me because I am used to the Capriotti's version of a Thanksgiving sandwich (the Bobbie... Which i love btw). So in order to convey my dismay with this sandwich I will now compare the two!!! My favorite features of the Bobbie are as follows: 1. The gobs of stuffing/ dressing, 2. The homemade cranberry sauce with real cranberries, 3. The  turkey is shredded turkey meat not lunch meat. Now the Earl of Sandwich version... Mistake #1: THEY USED PROCESSED SANDWICH MEAT, #2: Not a lot of dressing, #3: no cranberry, and #4: they toasted it!!! (So not a fan of toasted sandwiches!!!!)   Overall, I will not be back because there are to many places to get a sandwich and this place was nothing special to me!",

    "text": "I went to Vegas for a weekend in May, and all told I spent less than $300.  I made a little money playing poker, so I only left $170 in Sin City.  That's for food, gas, hotel, everything.  One of the reasons I was able to do this was that I got two meals out of Earl of Sandwich for a grand total of $6.48.  My car got to Vegas hours before our friends, so we decided to have a cheap, casual dinner.  I did a quick search on Yelp, and this place came up with its hundreds of reviews.  Earl of Sandwich is in Planet Hollywood, a kind of funny theme hotel if you know anything about Los Angeles.  I find it amusing that the mall is billed as the Miracle Mile Shops, as if the Miracle Mile is a glamorous shopping mecca in L.A.  Even Earl of Sandwich is out of place - it's a chain restaurant, but there isn't a single branch in California.  Don't be alarmed that it's a chain.  It's a step up from Quizno's (though I like Quizno's, and Subway, too), and I appreciated its impressive efficiency.  There was a short line to order, but once we got our orders in, we sat down with our buzzers.  They started buzzing while we were getting water, and our food was hot and ready within five minutes of arrival.  I ordered the Full Montagu with roast beef, turkey, aged swiss, sharp cheddar, lettuce, tomato, and mustard sauce.  I had half for dinner and half for lunch the next day - I never went hungry, and the sandwich reheated great.  It was really tasty, with good ingredients and plenty of them.  I also tried some of my friends' orders - the Italian sandwich and the Earl's Cobb.  The Italian was maybe even better than the Montagu, with a meatfest of salami, capicola, ham, and mortadello, topped with mozzarella, roma tomato, and a zesty Italian dressing.  Peppers were optional and delicious.  Even the salad was pretty good.  It wasn't a deprivation salad - it came with plenty of grilled chicken and bacon, swiss and cheddar cheese, and a buttermilk ranch dressing.  But it also had plenty of greens and tomato, cucumber, and cranberries.  If you're in Vegas for the full Vegas experience, go balls out, hit Robuchon, whatever you want.  But it's nice to know that you can eat something good for $5.99 and tax.  I love a good sandwich, and the Earl delivers.",

I also really adore the Original sandwich with its roast beef and the slightly sweet spread. The sandwiches have the perfect combination of flavor and crispy texture from the toasted bread.   The size is also well-portioned. The sandwich is cut in half and I have found that only eating half is the perfect size for a snack, while finishing the whole sandwich is the perfect size for a meal.",

I did wait in line around 1pm for about 10 minutes.  I also have been there at 11:30am with no line.  Either way, the line goes quick.  Sandwiches are not customizable much, as this is not Subway or Quizno's.  Just a heads-up.  I've had the Thanksgiving turkey and the Jerk chicken sandwich.  Both absolutely delicious.  I found the the Jerk chicken exceptional.  Both are served up warm after being toasted.  Also, they aren't HUGE sandwiches--about 7 inches long.  Although I practically inhaled both of my sandwiches (I was hungry), I washed them down with several refills of their very tasty Earl's Lemonade, which has earl grey tea in it--kinda like their version of the old Arnold Palmer.    The desserts look very tempting, especially the vanilla bean cupcake.  Haven't tried one of those yet.  With drink, my bill was just north of $9.  Fair enough for an excellent sandwich.  I'll come back without hesitation.",

It is also one of the best 24hr spots in town, so if you are nearby and hungry, go for it!  Not too many good spots to find food at 3am on the strip....most of the cafe's are a ripoff ($15-20+pp) and lack the taste of a memorable meal.  I recommend a lot of people here, and have had no complaints yet.  If only it was off strip, so us locals wouldn't have to navigate through the obstacle course named Las Vegas blvd to enjoy a solid sandwich.

It was delicious, but kind of small.  For the price, I thought the sandwich would be a bit bigger.  My boyfriend got the original sandwich and it wasn't really that great.  There was nothing special about it.  I would definitely go back for another chipotle chicken sandwich though.",

    "text": "EARL OF SANDWHICH Looking for some cheap(er) foods in Las Vegas after spending it all on gambling, shows, and buffets? The Earl of Sandwich can help! Located in Planet Hollywood, it is one of the cheapest and best foods that Las Vegas can offer! The sandwiches are only $5.99, which is half the price of anything else found in the City of Sin! We had the:  The Earl's Club - Roasted Turkey, Smoked Bacon, Aged Swiss Cheese, Lettuce, Roma Tomatoes & Sandwich Sauce (healthy and delicious)  Caribbean Jerk Chicken - Grilled Chicken, Roasted Red & Banana Peppers & Spicy Jerk Sauce (spicy with a pinch of sourness)  The sandwiches here are one of the best I've ever had. Once you've had some here, it makes Togos, Subways, and Quiznos taste like secondary citizens. Great thing about this place: it's open 24 hours, so when you're up gambling the night away, have one on the Earl! The Earl knows sandwiches... he did create them, in the first place! The choices are numerous, but the taste? They all taste great!!! The crispiness of the bread and the meats is mouthwatering!",

There was a lot to be happy about at this place, drunken bias aside: + Large variety of sandwiches and salads + Only 6 bucks, which is dirt cheap for Vegas! + I had the Cannonballs and it tasted really good + Plenty of seating with clean tables + They're open for most of the day and night  This place will fuel you with enough carby-goodness to get you through another day of experiencing Sin City. You should definitely consider making a pit stop here if you're around!",

    "text": "Correct me if I am wrong, but I don't get the impression that you can eat in Vegas in a satisfying manner, unless you have lots of money or lots of time or a huge stomach. In other words, restaurants are either pricey without quality food, or you have to wait in line forever, or it's a buffet. For a good chunk of the restaurants it even seems that at least two of these characteristics apply.  And here comes in Earl of Sandwich, the seemingly only place on the Strip where none of these apply.  The good: - I had a Full Montagu and it was quite delicious. Good ingredients, flavorful and the bread was so good that the sandwich still tasted good the next day. - Their selection is good, and they sell a good variety of healthy sides and drinks - even milk! - Price-wise I think Earl of Sandwich is very reasonable. After reading reviews I expected some high prices but 6 dollars is what you pay at most other good sandwich places too.  The bad: - The sandwiches are small! Luckily I only wanted a small snack, but for 6 dollars I am used to sandwiches which are 1 1/2 the size of what you get here. - The location is a little loud, but oh well - it's in the middle of a shopping mall/casino.  All in all, Earl of Sandwich is a restaurant chain, and it should get more stars than Potbelly and less than Jimmy John's, and this time I am solving my half-star dilemma by rounding up. After all, it is noticeably better than Potbelly.",

There's nothing worse than a sandwich with not enough meat, especially for a carnivore such as myself.  Oh and the bread....perfection!  The best part?  They're reasonably priced, some may even say cheap (at least I think so).  When you compare the quality & price of this to a chain, then yeah, this is cheap!    Plus, their service is pretty fast.  Although I didn't like the whole ordering your drink at the second cashier thing.  My only other complaint?  They messed up my drink order.  They gave me an ice tea instead of a lemonade, but ah well, it wasn't a big deal.  Definitely worth going to for a quick bite.

After over 500+ reviews, I'm not going to be adding anything new or groundbreaking about this place, but because I went twice in the two days I was in Vegas, I felt I had to write a review.  Vegas has tons of great places to eat, ranging from $1.99 breakfasts to meals that can go into the hundreds at high-end places, and usually, you get what you pay for. But not at Earl.  For $5.99 you can choose from their selections of hot sandwiches (don't even THINK about going for a wrap or a salad) because that's what they're known for. I got the holiday sandwich (roasted turkey breast, stuffing, cranberry sauce, seasoned aoli, and gravy) and it was simply awesome. The bf liked it better than his original (roast beef,cheddar, horseradish sauce). The bread they use is different than any I've had before, almost the consistency of a biscuit, but perfect for their sandwiches.  If you go back again in less than 24 hours, you know the place is awesome, and that's what we did. We went back right before we flew out, and thankfully they have fast service, that we made it to our flight in time. Totally worth it. I had the caribbean jerk chicken this time, which was good, but tasted nothing like jerk chicken. Still a great sandwich though.  Earl is more like the King of Sandwiches.",

I thought why no other sandwich place does this. It makes sense if you think of it since people get confused what the hell they order half the time.  My wait was about 5-10 minutes which was not bad.  After biting into my sandwich and all the juices oozing out, this was a perfectly toasted and tasting sandwich. All the meat and cheese were melted just right.   They need to have more locations, especially in Los Angeles. This might be the first place I go back to once I come back to Las Vegas.",

I realized that I did not want to eat at some fine dinning sit down place by myself so I went on a mission to find some good quality quick food.

    "text": "I've been wanting to try this place after reading friend's reviews and seeing pictures of their sammies that they ordered.  Luckily, we were able to try this place after clubbing at Tao.  Open 24 hours!!  yay!!!  A couple of friends and I had \"breakfast\" or a \"late dinner\" at 4 am. at Earl's and it was still a happening place.  Lots of people ordering food.  I couldn't decide between the full montague or the original so I got both - one for me and one for my hubby.  Then we split both and shared half of each with each other.  The Full montague is with turkey, tomatoes, lettuce, and roast beef, and earl's sauce.  The Original is roast beef with a horseradish sauce and earl's sauce.  I LOVED the original.  I liked it better than the full montague because you can taste the roast beef a lot more and has a tiny hint of horseradish that tantalizes your tastebuds.  yum!  I liked the full montague, too.  but the original is better, in my opinion.  Hubby thought the opposite.  He liked the full montague more than the original.    Price:  $6 each sandwich.  My friend got the tomato soup,too, and she loved it.  It was only $3.99!  There a lot more choices to choose from.  Whenever I go back to Vegas, I'm definitely  going to come here again and try out their other sandwiches!  It was crowded when we went but the line goes pretty fast.    Would definitely recommend Earl's!",

Lines are long but that just proves how popular it is and a testament to how great their sandwiches really are.  I swear each bite of a sandwich is so flavorful makes me wonder what do they put in it to make it so good!?!   Prices are reasonable and I've only tried a few sandwiches but they were all fantastically flavorful.  I would give any of their sandwiches a try.  Sober or drunk this place is a must try.

The sandwich was tasty, but I found a little bland. For me, it could've use more condiments or sauce, but by the time I was eating, I was out of range of any. The roast beef was really good though, I can tell, but I could've done with either more or crisper veggies. My preference. The bread is nice and toasted.   The Wisconsin cheddar soup was ok. Not a fan of cheese soups. I used it as a dip for my sandwich to give it more flavor.   Earl's lemonade was kind of watery tasting, but I figured I might have been either used to or expecting really strongly flavored drinks. I think a sweeter or more tea flavor would've been nice.  I didn't like the cookie bites, I found them too dry and hard, but my boyfriend really like them.   It's a tasty sandwich and meal overall, but the line is killer. I would eat there again if it weren't for the crowd.",

The meat is hot and perfectly seasoned, and if you drench the thing in dijon mustard, you can weep quietly while you eat this masterpiece. And everything for under $6, typically.  It's severely cost-effective for Vegas, too. A must-try! There's a reason you'll find a decent-sized line at all hours.",

Speaking of pop, skip it and go for the Earl's Grey Lemonade (their Arnold Palmer).",

    "text": "How come everyone seems to have heard of this place before except me.  We were walking back to our hotel room when I ran into my daughter who was hanging out with her friends, and even SHE had a sandwich bag from Earl's...  I guess I just don't look for sandwiches while I'm in Vegas, especially on the Strip, or in this case inside the shopping area at PH.  Another reason is that rarely frequent any sandwich chains to begin with,  although I used to go to Togo's all the time, and I briefly fell in love with Quizno's for awhile, but in these cases it was because they were one of my go to places near work...  The place seems to be popular, I'll give it that.  It's an inexpensive $6 value that you can pack to go and stands up pretty well if you want to bring it back to wherever you're staying in LV.  The toasty bread I guess is one of the best things about the sandwich, it reminds me of ciabatta bread because it's crusty and sort of sandy floury, but moistened by the oil or butter that they use to press the heated sandwich like a panini.  Efficient, they serve up the sandwiches like neatly packaged bricks in foil wrappers... <a href=\"http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/DkYS3arLOhA8si5uUEmHOw?select=nbZOfLY7cUr2tnubkswwlQ\">yelp.com/biz_photos/DkYS...</a>  At first, I thought The Full Montagu was a play on words on The Full Monty, or maybe some Shakespearean reference -- was there also a Full Capulet sandwich (although it's really spelled \"Montague\");  no, actually it's in reference to John Montagu, the 4th Earl of Sandwich with whom the sandwich is named.  I had one, <a href=\"http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/DkYS3arLOhA8si5uUEmHOw?select=3rHsnjWiJQIDCWMWE-mT1git\">yelp.com/biz_photos/DkYS...</a> was a two meat, two cheese sandwich consisting of roast beef, turkey, aged swiss, and cheddar, with lettuce, tomato, and mustard.  It was a very hardy sandwich and admittedly very satisfying.  We also had The Italian <a href=\"http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/DkYS3arLOhA8si5uUEmHOw?select=IjSHtwUtQzJjGi2-6pBaWA\">yelp.com/biz_photos/DkYS...</a> and wifey had a more subdued Caprese. <a href=\"http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/DkYS3arLOhA8si5uUEmHOw?select=EXD7ciCNLGuEZNuPXdNYJA\">yelp.com/biz_photos/DkYS...</a>  They seemed to be satisfied with their choices...  Open 24 hours, I heard that this place is popular among the clubbing crowd as a late night snack.  To me this is still just a freakin sandwich place that isn't even a deli which I generally favor, but I would have to admit that it has a pretty successful following, and that being open at all hours for $6 is a pretty good value...",

You will sign when you bite into your frist one. If you are a fan of A.1. sauce like myself, Try the HP sauce on the table. It goes amazing with almost all the hot sandwiches. NNNGGGHHH IT'S SO GOOD.

It's chill and always relaxed and a good time when I come here with the fam.  Our go to sandwiches are the Full Montague and The Original (both are roasted beef sandwiches).   We tried the tuna melt, but I felt as if they were skimping on the tuna.  Where'd the tuna go for the other half of the sandwich?  Womp womp.  Ask for extra tomatoes-- get your veggies and make the sandwich extra juicy :)  Tomato Soup:  Yummy! Especially with the baked croutons that they throw in-- they soak up the soup and are still crispy in the middle.   Turkey Chili Soup:  I felt like it tasted too healthy... maybe throw in some more seasoning to make it more chili-flavored?",

He had the Full Montagu both times where I had the Earl's Club sandwich and the Earl's Cobb Wrap sandwich.  You really cant go wrong with the amount of food that you get, plus what you pay for it too. We both ate (each time) for $20. Talk about reasonable. It was nice to ease up on the wallet while in Vegas given that some of the other places you eat at, they can be a little pricey!  Would definitely go back again!!!",

That aside, there are four laws of Sandwich  1  Soft fillings are best served on soft breads. 2. When wet ingredients, such as tomatoes are used, a thin coating of mayonnaise, butter, cream cheese or oil should be applied to the bread as a moisture barrier. 3. Avoid placing layers of slippery, slidy substances next to one another 4. Never, ever use a bread you wouldn't eat on its own.  The sandwich I had was the earls club. Which consisted of :Roasted Turkey, Smoked Bacon, Aged Swiss, Lettuce, Roma Tomatoes & Sandwich Sauce. The sandwich was generally nice it followed all of the rules I set out aside here. It mostly stayed together very well, had good structure and mostly good taste.  The major downside I would say is that they seem to really skimp on the amount of actually filling they give, the bread seemed to be mostly bread and filler to me. I didn't really get the feeling that I got my 8 dollars worth of sandwich.The place wasn't anything special, just a mall style eatery in a casino.

I had to get in line and order my sandwich, and they gave me a buzzer letting me know to pick up anything else that I wanted on down the line to the cashier.  They have a variety of sandwiches but not so many that you get overwhelmed.  I tried the club and my husband had the jerk chicken.  I noticed that their sammies are all served hot, so I was excited to try a hot club sandwich.  We didn't have to wait long and the subs came wrapped in gold foil wrapper.  They remind me of paninis, just not flatly pressed.  Pretty good subs and they are nice and hot.  The club was really good and full of bacon, so I loved it.  As for the jerk chicken, that was really good too and nice and spicy.  They serve desserts like brownies and cookies, so you don't have to go anywhere for a full meal.  You  must try it--the sammies are worth the trip down to the strip.",

The line can seem intimidating but it moves super quick because Earl's is amazingly efficient. They may only have a handful selection of sandwiches but each sandwich is made with TLC. I had myself the Full Montagu and it was delish. A bit smaller than I wanted it to be but then again I'm on a diet anyways and we were getting this at 4am so don't need to eat something that big anyways.  Come here if you are in Vegas.

I prefer fast casual and don't want to pay $30+ per person after tax and tip at sit-down places.  Many other fast casual places have terrible food options and are still over-priced for what you get.  Chipotle is the only other place we liked as much and could rotate these every day.    Family is tired of Subway and EOS has been a welcomed alternative.  Thank you!!",

OMG its SOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO good!   But.. I dont know if it is because it is good or just because I had about 15 mojitos and 9 shots intus. But, all I know:  People of Earls, if you are missing a bottle of mustard, it was me who took it. I do not recall a lot but I woke up with the bottle in the bed and mustard all over my face. The sandwich was squooshed on my boobs. With mustard.  I do remember dropping a whole bottle of applejuice on my fabulous shoes, because they still smell like apple. I guess a got an apple pedi :)  The sandwiches, beeing a little intoxicated, taste just FANTASTIC!!! not too greasy, very fresh, very delicious.  It is even easy to find after that many drinks in the Planet hollywood!  I love you forever!",

    "text": "I'm not going to even read any of the other reviews and instead spend all my attention on talking about how amazing this place is. I always stay at Planet Hollywood when I'm in Vegas so it's a no brainer that I usually end up eating at the Spice Market Buffet(which happens to be the #1 rated buffet in Vegas) or The Buffet at the Aria ( which I believe should be the #1 rated). I always passed by Earl of Sandwich during my shopping trips at Miracle Mile, but I never sat down to try their food.  Last week in Vegas as I was going back to my room around 5AM I realized just how hungry I was...and so there it was, Earl of Sandwich- OPEN 24 hours! Hell yes. I ordered myself a BLT Sandwich and to my surprise it was heavenly. The bacon was crisp-and there was an abundance of it. The mayo was not overdone, and the tomatoes, well just ask for extra tomatoes if you are like me ( I like a decent balance between my meats and tomatoes). And it cost like $7!!!!!  I went to sleep and woke up dreaming about Earl of Sandwich..so I had it for breakfast....then lunch...and then dinner..and then a late night midnight snack. I wasn't the only one though, everyone in my group felt the same exact way. I rather eat Earl of Sandwich than go to those dumb restaurants- ( although that all you can eat Brazilian BBQ place at Caesars is the greatest place on Earth).  What I ordered throughout my trip:  BLT sandwich- ask for extra tomatoes  Apple- DELICIOUS and fresh.  Coffee- surprisingly amazing. Although Starbucks is located across the Black Jack  Tables, I wouldn't budge.   Breakfast Sandwich- Eggs/Cheese/Bacon- AMAZING  Chicken/Avocado Club- this was my second favorite sandwich, I really liked the sauce they used..might have been Chipotle sauce. YUM!  Anyways, just give them a try...you WON'T regret it.",

    "text": "With over 1500 reviews (mostly 5 star), this is no longer a secret.   When you come here, there will certainly be a long line, but it moves fairly quickly.  The reason is simple:  this is a solid lunch or after-club option for cheap eats.   Their sandwiches are about $7, their hot sandwiches are very flavorful, and their meats are great.    Their full montague is their most popular sandwich.  I've also tried their carribean jerk, which has a mild spice to it.  This visit, I tried their seasonal turkey sandwich, which had stuffing and cranberry sauce.  The turkey was moist and it was just a well made sandwich.  These are flavor-packed sandwiches and a solid option for cheap eats in the middle of the strip.  If you're looking for other cheap eats on the strip, I'd recommend that you venture to the \"Secret Pizza\" place in Cosmopolitan, to Chipotle by Harrah's, and to the food court at Excalibur (where you can find Quiznos, McD, Pizza Hut, Krispy Kreme, and Baja Fresh sans markup).  On the other side of town, then you could go to Circus Circus, Tacos El Gordo, or the Fashion Show Mall for budget eats.  (Downtown is a different story altogether),   However....in looking at this list....Earl of Sandwich, Tacos El Gordo, and the Secret Pizza place are clear standouts and you should consider checking them out if you're looking to seek great food options under $10.",

One size sandwich Stopped here twice for back-to-back meals.  1) Earl's Club: Meh. Filled with bacon, turkey, lettuce & tomato and sauce. I rarely find myself having to add seasoning/sauce to my food. However this was one of the times I had to add dijon mustard just to take away the somewhat blandness of the product. It pains me to say this but even a sandwich from Subway was better than this one.  2) Hawaiian BBQ: Better than the Earls Club, IMO. Between the melted cheese, meat, pineapple & BBQ sauce, this one's a winner. Would definitely order this one again.  This place is great to try at least once based on all the talk. Sandwich is the perfect size when you have chips, salad, etc. I've had better sandwiches elsewhere but it was convenient due to staying @ PH.  Main gripe: Keep a full stock of them big ass choc chip cookies. Both times I went, there were none left.",

Oh & if you happen to be here around thanksgiving & xmas, get the holiday sandwich, its like having turkey left overs with all the goodness inside !",

My friend Nick compared this to Quiznos, and I couldn't agree more--the place even smells like one. It's nice that they have a deep menu, but today I tried to order a slight variation of their Mediterranean sandwich and I thought I blew the counter girl's mind.  The bread is good--there's no question about that. But they were light on the veggies, and I think they forgot the banana peppers entirely. I had their peppermint brownie which knocked you on the face with mint but was a bit dry.  I'll probably try the place for a third time with a few drinks in me--maybe that will help a bit.",

Rating the sandwiches by the popularity of the group i'd say it went like this  #1. it's a tie - Full Montague & The Original #2. The All American #3. Cannonballs  So you know when you read roast beef or roast turkey on the menu, you don't actually think it'll have a smokey kind of roast flavor right?  well these sangwiches do!  especially with the All American, you get a great smokey flavor on the turkey, combined with the cheddar cheese and cranberry sauce make an amazing sandwich.  Also the chicken salad was pretty good too.     I will say it's not the best sandwich i've ever had in my life, but it is an awesomely delicious sandwich and it's cheap for the location and you can't beat that combo - 5 stars.",

Their process for taking orders and making the sandwiches is efficient. I applaud management for making the process smooth and seamless.

By the time I was done walking around , I was hungry.  I was staying at the Cosmopolitan, so Earl of Sandwich (which is located at Planet Hollywood) is a short walk over. I have been to Earl of Sandwich before, but it has been years since I went, so I was hoping that the quality and taste did not go downhill.  (I have also tried the Earl of Sandwich in Disneyworld and although it was great, I felt it was not as amazing as the Vegas location).    I normally get the Montagu, but this time I wanted to try the Chicken Avocado sandwich.  For 12AM on Saturday, the restaurant was fairly empty.  I ordered and got a buzzer.  There was plenty of seating around and the sandwich came out super quickly.  I bit into the hot sandwich and YUMMMM!!!! The chicken was tender, avocadoes fresh, and the bread was crispy.  The only small complaint that I have is that the chipotle dressing was a little on the light side (which probably is better for me anyways, LOL).  So, if you like more dressing on your sandwich, make sure to order extra dressing.  Aside from that, it was a delicious snack to cap off my weekender in Vegas. I was excited to learn that the sandwich still was amazing.  I will definitely be back here again anytime I am back in Vegas.",

I ended up getting the Full Montagu, Earl's club, and original 1762. While I waited, I ran over to fat Tuesdays and grabbed a drink.  The sandwiches came out pretty quickly. It paired perfectly with the sandwiches. They tasted amazing and were piping hot.  Full Montagu: Roasted beef, turkey, Swiss, cheddar, lettuce, Roma tomato & mustard sauce  The Earl's Club: Turkey, bacon, Swiss, Lettuce, Tomato & sandwich sauce  The Original 1762: Roasted beef, cheddar & horseradish sauce  I don't remember the full montagu having turkey in it... but that's what the internets is telling me.  It tasted great. everything worked well... you can't do much to mess up a sandwich so  \\_()_/   The 1762 was my favorite probably because I love anything horseradish. It wasn't super spicy... it tasted like Arby's horseradish sauce but less artificial. worked real well with the roasted beef and the cheddar.   Earl's club is good, I'd eat it if someone got it for me... but of course I'd rather opt for the other two.  They all tasted like how sandwiches should taste... perfectly sauced, not overly salty... and not tasteless. Great for a quick, hot meal. Would eat again / 10",

The prices were so cheap compared to all the other all night places.   It's counter service style. Employees were very friendly considering the shift they were working. Service was super quick.   I ordered the pizza bread which was more like an individual  square deep dish cheese pizza. It was amazing!

It is always busy and you always have to wait and find a seat...  Seating is limited, and again it is right outside Planet Hollywood and right in front of an entrance to the mall.   The sandwiches are great!  I had the turkey holiday sandwich, both hubby and I agreed it makes you feel like Thanksgiving dinner all over again.  Hubby liked his ES Original sandwich which is a roast beef sandwich.  His comment on this one, was maybe next time have the horse radish on the side.  We both agreed, nothing else but sandwiches.  They fries and Mac n cheese we're just ok and really isn't needed...  We will definitely be back to try different sandwiches, with some chips and a drink, because really...  That's all you need.",

There was no line, and I ordered the chipotle avocado chicken. Pretty seamless process. I was given a buzzer for when the food was ready. I waited about 15 minutes which I thought was a little long for them to make a sandwich while not being busy.   When I received my sandwich, it seemed like they were stingy with the meat. The sandwich seemed so small! I ordered a full sandwich too, not even a half one. The wheat bread, however, was nearly burnt. It seemed like they didn't put much avocado either. They were generous with the sauce, which offset most of the sandwich.",

The tuna melt sandwich with tobacco!!  The first time I tried one of their sandwiches was when a local promoter took me there before (or maybe after?) clubbing. I was sober and he insisted on ordering the tuna melt. I HATE cheese, but he insisted it would be different. IT. IS. DIFFERENT.  Since that first incident years ago, I've been back 1-2x per trip. Every single time I get the tuna melt. I've tried other sandwiches and each time..I think I had a brain fart. I mean, what was I thinking?! Why deviate from the best sandwich?  Btw, if you do end up getting the tuna melt, you MUST also sprinkle on the regular red tobacco sauce! march made in heaven!!",

    "text": "Hello my Yelpies,  EARLS? Why you got to be so freaking delicious. It's like literally little pieces of love bites every time I bite into it.   I've had earls many times before and it never once disappoint me. I definitely agree with their slogan \"Best Hot Sandwich in the world\". They definitely represent it extremely well. I've pretty much tried all of their sandwiches and every single one of them have their unique taste. But I have to say my favorite is their number one. It comes with turkey and tomato, I love how they have a choice of white or wheat bread. I'm all about that wheat bread due to personal reasons so that was fantastic.   The other thing I love the most is their famous tomato soup. I've never had a tomato soup like theirs before. It wasn't too salty or too much tomato taste, it had the best texture and seasoning. I would like everyone to try dipping their sandwich into the soup too because the way their bread soaks into the soup gives it more definition to your tastebud.   This place is delicious, affordable and enjoyable. Can never go wrong with EARLS. I'm so thankful that they have one closer to LA now so I don't have to go all the way to Vegas to fulfill my sandwich needs.   Overall, 5 stars for food and drinks, 5 stars for service, 5 stars for cleanliness and 5 stars for environment and decoration. I wish I can give it a 10 stars if I could because this place definitely deserves more than a 5 stars. You will see me very soon!!!",

My friend got the original full Montague, whereas I decided to be a little different and got the Italian sandwich. Pretty damn good if I must say so myself.  The bread on both sandwiches were beautifully toasted and each sandwich was the perfect size to wrap your lips around and take bite after bite after bite. Not too greasy and not too filling. Twas a quite amazing sandwich.  My only problem with this place is the location and the wait (at least a 30 minute wait). So, if you're near Planet Hollywood, by all means, please please try this place. BUT, if you're not ... just be prepared for the trek. And sometimes, they run out of the full Montague. So, get there before they run out! A definite place to try if you're in a Vegas.",

This time he got the original and then he got the HOLIDAY TURKEY SANDWICH with turkey, cranberries, and stuffing!! Yes! STUFFING!! If you are reading this and are near to an Earl's, please stop reading and head to Earl's NOW! He thought it was the most delicious thing ever.   I had the chicken noodle soup which was probably one of the best chicken noodle soups I have ever had (besides yours, Grandma!) and a peanut butter and jelly sandwich. Yes, the PB&J is off the kids menu but I was craving it! When it came it was hot! I was skeptical at first of a hot PB&J but it was sooo yummy! I also love all the brownies and cookies at the register and always make sure to grab a couple bags of the BBQ chips. Delish!!  I can't wait to go back to Earl's one day.

Ive tried the tuna melt, Hawaiian BBQ, and Caribbean Jerk Chicken.  These are some of the best ones they have.  All 3 of them are equally good and recommend any of these.  Another plus is that these sandwiches are only $5.99 which is a very reasonable price for what you get.  I also love that each table has a bottle of Grey Poupon to add to the flavor of each sandwich.",

For the price I would give it 4.5stars because its like $7 but its nothing special....well it is compared to subway haha. I had the tuna melt, it was good. They unfortunately only have pepsi products so if you are a coke line fan like me prepare to be disappointed.",

THE EARL CLUB SANDWICH is one of the most popular. ($6.30) It was tasty, toasted and hit the spot. They could spare more meat. I wish it had a little more.  It is a decent spot that I will try again.",

I always get the the original which is delicious! the bread is perfectly toasted with the tasty roast beef inside. The service is very good and quick. Dont let the long line fool you. they have a good system that gets you in and out with your food in like 10 minutes. and it is definitely worth the wait.   All the sandwiches run about 7.00 plus tax which is a great price considering they are in the middle of a very popular hotel and mall (planet hollywood).   i highly recommend this sandwich restaurant if you are looking for a good cheap meal any time of the day. remember its open 24 hours a day!",

They have a toaster similar to Quiznos except better in my opinion and a really good variety of sandwiches, salads, soups, and even breakfast items and small dessert snacks. I had the tomato soup with extra croutons and my friend and I shared the Full Montague and Holiday Turkey. It was creamy tomato soup and really tasty, I took the recommendation of extra croutons from another yelp review and don't regret it once so ever. Ingredients in both sandwiches were very fresh and a good amount to pack enough flavor. I really enjoyed the full Montague but hell if the Holiday Turkey is available (bc apparently it isn't always around), get it!!!! It's literally thanksgiving packed into one sandwich with stuffing, cranberry sauce, turkey, mayo and gravy. Freaking out of this world!!! I want to get another before leaving Vegas! There's plenty if sandwich options. Wish I was around long enough to explore the other options, but will always remember this place whenever visiting Vegas.",

    "text": "I am so glad I ended my Vegas trip eating at Earl of Sandwich, and even more glad that they're opening up a second location in Anaheim. It was delicious and better than what I had expected. I already had seen the reviews, heard the raves about the warm sandwiches from my friend, but it was so delicious that it has to be about the best sandwich ever - and at an affordable price!  So Earl's is open 24 hours and is located in Planet Hollywood. I'm sure people flock here after the clubbing events and whatnot - that explains the 24 hours deal. We came here around 12 on a Saturday and there was a long line, but not too long a wait. You basically give your order to the cashier and she gives you a beeper and a receipt where you slide down the counter (watching them make the sandwiches and salads) before you pay at the second cashier. And a few minutes after that, your beeper rings signaling you to pick up your sandwich.   There were so many great options that I really wanted to try them all. In the end, I got The Earl's Club (Roasted Turkey, Smoked Bacon, Aged Swiss Cheese, Lettuce, Roma Tomatoes & Sandwich Sauce) and my friend got the Tuna and we traded half. The Club was really good - but what's so great about it is that the bread is warm and crispy, making the sandwich an overall plus. There wasn't too much bacon, but I liked the amount of turkey that was in it. The tuna was also great. The warm bread, a plus, and the tuna salad inside was awesome (better than Subway!). They cut the sandwich for you into a bigger half and a smaller half, but the overall sandwich is not that big. Perhaps about 6 inches. Each is wrapped up in a gold foil with a pretty sticker to differentiate between the various sandwiches.   There's a few tables to sit down and eat and relax. For the price of the sandwich (around six/seven dollars), I was pretty pleased. If only they came with some complimentary potato chips on the side :)   Can't wait to try the other sandwiches!",

The group I was with was making bets/to-do items for our weekend in Sin City and this was one of my items.  Affordable and 24/7 sounds good to me especially since my friends who are Vegas regulars always spoke well of it.  I got the Chipotle Chicken Avocado and it was tasty but not sure if it's worth all the hype. The bread was nicely toasted but do wish there was more inside goods in my sandwich. It just didn't wow me like sandwiches at other joints which I still think quite fondly of. Perhaps I should try one of their other sandwiches; I'm not ruling it out just wanted to get my oral pleasure on. And I didn't get my O moment here.  Do be warned not all their buzzers work, mines didn't light up or buzz and after noticing everyone in my group get theirs and other folks after me in line get theirs, I had to finally go and investigate to find out where my sandwich was, it was just chilling there.  Tried to get also an ice cream sandwich and they either ran out or were phasing it out.  Sadly, my cousin's beloved Caribbean Jerk Chicken is no longer available and the staff couldn't give us a reason why.",

If anything the people before either didn't know how to clean up after themselves or choose to be rude and left it there when the trashcan is 5 steps away. Watch out for that.",

We went around noon on a Sunday and there was a short line. Waited only a couple minutes to get to the cashier. Once we placed our order, we found a table and waited 5 minutes for our food.   We ordered the chicken chipotle avocado sandwich, the pastrami Reuben and tortilla soup. Both sandwiches were delicious! The sauce in the chicken chipotle sandwich was so tasty. It had a slight sweetness to it. And the pastrami in the Reuben was very fresh. Usually, you'll get a rubbery texture from pastrami at places like subway or togos but the pastrami here was much like Ike's (if you've ever had it). It was easy to bite through. And the tortilla soup was sooo tasty. So many flavors going on in there! And the tortilla chips on too add a nice crunch to the soup. We dipped our sandwiches in the soup from time to time and it tasted delicious.   Great place to go to if you want a satifying fulfilling meal at an affordable price. Will definitely come back to try the other items on the menu :)",

I like crunch, but this baby was a perfect balance of light crunch and decent amount of softness on the inside. Their different sauces were pretty good. The holiday turkey and the Caribbean are to be ordered. The full montague was pretty good but wasn't amazing, I was a little disappointed to be honest. The sandwiches definitely need to be jam packed on the inside doe... the inside was a little too lean.  The price was right, the workers were aite, and the line set up took away from the experience but oh well. I say give the chap a 3.5 rounded up.",

By far, one of my favorite places to eat. Doesn't sound like much, right? Hot sandwiches? Glorified Subway? Oh but it so much more than that... the bread is crispy perfection, and I've never been disappointed by my sandwich.   My boyfriend and I usually get the Chipotle chicken avocado and it is just so delicious. I think it's a good deal since sandwich places (I'm looking at you Subway) usually charge extra for avocado, but this sandwich is still the same price as the others (around $7 with tax). I recently tried Holiday Turkey (no mayo) and it was pretty good. I like my usual better but the stuffing and cranberry brought out the flavor of the turkey. I also like the tomato soup, because it comes with croutons. So creamy and complements my sandwich so well.   One thing though is that they don't offer wheat bread like the Disney location... but then again, when I got wheat bread one time, it came out so burnt that my bf couldn't stop laughing. :( So maybe not a bad thing.   Hopefully, one day, I can stay at Planet Hollywood so that this glorious 24/7 restaurant can be within walking distance :)",

The first time I had one was in Walt Disney World on my friend's recommendation. I was not disappointed! Whenever I'm in Vegas and I'm just looking for something quick to eat at lunch before stuffing myself at the buffet for dinner, I'll always think Earl of Sandwich. The line at this location can get long at times, but it goes by pretty quickly. It's located right across from sportsbook inside the PH. My go-to sandwiches are the Holiday Turkey and The Original 1762. I've had the Full Montague as well, but it didn't really stand out for me. Wasn't bad, but just didn't feel like this was one of their specialties. If you're going to try Earl's for the first time, start with The Original. If you're hooked, start working your way down the list. Include a drink, and your total should still be under $10.  Make sure to eat the sandwich while it's still piping hot. You would be ruining the experience otherwise.",

The line can get really long, but dont worry.. from experience, they move pretty fast!  The menu here consists of several different types of sandwiches...   I've had the: Earls Club The Full Montagu* Tuna Melt Chipotle Chicken Avocado Hawaiian BBQ* Caribbean Jerk Chicken* meatball one (Forgot the name)  The ones with the * are my favorite ones :)  The sandwiches are made pretty fast.. you get a buzzer that buzzes when your order is ready.  Aside from sandwiches, they also have wraps, soups, macaroni salad, coleslaw, fruit cups, cookies, muffins and other baked goods.  The coleslaw here is pretty good to eat with your sandwiches too.  Price is very affordable compared to most of the food joints in Vegas.. plus it's at a very convenient location.. found in Planet Hollywood on the strip.. and there's even a Sugar factory and Fat Tuesday near by :)",

It's basically a really good panini with tasty fillings, how can you go wrong?  +The artisan bread they use is really good.  And filling.  And a bit greasy.  It really coats the stomach if you know what I mean. +Veggie sandwich was VERY good.  +Long lines but they move really fast.  As a side note, the sandwich was really good when I was sober.  But after a night of drinking, the leftovers were amazing!",

Because it's the best sandwich I have ever had. We came here at about 2am, and there was a line wrapped clear around the casino. We both had the ham and swiss. Very simple. Absolutely delicious. Loved it so much that we went back the day we were flying back home to Portland. I am SO glad we don't live in Las Vegas. I'd be at Earl of Sandwich at least twice a week, and my health would likely not forgive me (not to mention the rest of the amazing food that awaits you in Sin City). The soup is also to die for. The tomato... omg... wonders to behold. The prices are ridiculously reasonable.   Planet Hollywood gets us into their casino because of Earl of Sandwich.",

We ate the chinese chicken salad when on the plane back in the morning, so it was a little late to experience the freshness, but, it was still great!

We were staying at the Planet Hollywood and were walking through the casino towards the car when we decided to stand in line at Earl of sandwich for what appeared to pass as a reasonable deli food. Bare in mind, I hate wasting tummy space on anything that tastes ordinary.   The sandwich was filling but not too heavy sandwich. And it was ready in 5 minutes! The warm soft bread was delicious. Who would have thought that a sandwich shop next to the Planet Hollywood sports book would be cheap and tasty! We liked it so much we actually came here again the next afternoon for lunch. I believe I had the Full Montague both times.  I'll probably make s stop there on my next Vegas trip this 4th of July weekend!!!",

However, I personally prefer the original ! In addition to the sandwiches, I also enjoy eating their clam chowder here, because it definitely hits the spot after a crazy night of partying.   Service: The line is always long during the daytime, I feel like this place needs to learn how to be more efficient about this aspect of the business.

Hands down, the Earl Club is my FAVE. 5 stars!!! The Montague just had a  different taste to it that didn't appeal to me. The tomato soup was bland. I want to say it's missing basil or some kind of spice. I had to add salt to taste.  Awesome that it's open 24 hours and there is ample seating.

Yes this place is so perfect that I ate here 2/3 days in Vegas. I know the 1500+ reviews already speak for themselves but I feel compelled to write a review because it's that delicious!!!  To be honest I only had the Holiday Turkey Special so I didn't try the normal ones but OMG. Turkey, stuffing, gravy, cranberry sauce, seasoned mayo, all between two perfectly toasted pieces of bread. HEAVEN. I should've been more daring but I just loved this sandwich so much I didn't want to try anything else. I think I could live on this.... ultimate thanksgiving sandwich.   Good at both 3am and 1pm, or any other time for that matter since it's 24/7!! I also got the loaded potato soup which was decent, but their forte is obviously their sandwiches. When most other decent meals in Vegas are at least $10, Earl of Sandwich shines through at a reasonable price of $5.99.... salivating as I write this.  On behalf of all my friends, the next time you're in Vegas, you MUST stop here, whether it's at 4am after a night of clubbing or for an orgasmic lunch/dinner-- heck, even breakfast!!!",

This sandwich place is located halfway inside the casino and halfway inside the mall.  The line is long...but they get through it pretty quickly.  You order at the first reg, grab your ticket, and a pager.  While standing in line, you could pick up a bottled water, couples of sides, chips, and a dessert.  Pay at the end.  Assembly line...works wonders.    A few minutes later, our pager started buzzing...hot sandwiches ready for devouring!  I had the original which came with roast beef and horseradish sauce.  Great sandwich...perfect consistency on the bread...meat was sliced perfectly thin...but the horsey sauce just wasn't right.  I guess I just would like it a little spicier rather than sweeter.  Wifey had the full montagu...turkey, roast beef, Swiss, cheddar, and mustard sauce.  That sandwich was the bomb diggity.  Every bite was juicy and delish...highly recommend that one.    Our friend ordered the club...although I didn't get to try it, it was gone in 1.5 seconds.  That should say enough.  Haha.    I'm glad we tried this place before we left...I saw that they're opening one at Disneyland.  Hopefully, a location in northern Cali is in the works!",

The feta tasted like it came from a generic box and did no justice to the salad. The dressing itself was so-so. There was definitely nothing Greek about this salad.

Lines are long, but workers are fast. You end up waiting in line for only 15 mins the most. I've tried a few of their sandwiches now and my favorite is the Italian.   What makes Earl's work in comparison to other sandwich chains is their ability to create you a simple sandwich with the BEST/FRESH ingredients. I don't think they have any secret, they just go above standards. And as with each sandwich, there's a unique taste so it varies and not just the same mustard or mayo you're used to.  No, I do not want either white or wheat bread!! My only wish is if they served their bread on dutch crutch. That's the real bread winner right there",

This time, you could see their assembly line running like a well oiled machine producing my order quickly, and efficiently. When I unwrapped the sandwich, steam rose out and cheese oozed from the sides. The ratio of roast beef to bread was perfect and the horseradish was generous. This is the sandwich of my memory.

I had read some reviews on the place and thought it was worth a shot.  I ordered the Chipotle Chickent Sandwhich.  Chicken breast pieces sandwiched between a cibotta roll with bacon, avacado and chipotle sauce.  I ordered extra sauce on the side and was sure glad I did because it was so good.  The sandwich was amazing.  I absolutely loved it except that half the sandwich had only a couple little pieces of chicken-a little lopsided I guess.  I hate when that happens.  My boyfriend got the Caribbean Chicken sandwich and it was really good too.  Too many red/green peppers for me but had great flavor and he thought it was great.  We did share the tomato soup which came with the croutons- in it.  Soggy!  Next time I will for sure ask for those on the side.  Soup was pretty good too.  Service was an eh.  Not too friendly and not anything special.  Good thing the food was good.  I definitely would recommend this place especially when you are looking for a quick bite with a good price-not \"tourist prices\". ;)",

Service: I was surprise to find a long line at 3 in the morning for sandwiches. It reminds me of fast food where you order and pick up. The staff is quick and fast.  Food: I love their sandwiches but the portions are small to me. They even have Mac & cheese, salads, pastries, and soup.  Recommendations: Best damn tuna melt ever. It's a must have!

Got the usual \"I really hate my job, but I'm too lazy to find something else\" smileless service at the register. You know, I'm okay with food service apathy. Order placed, order taken, time to wait.   Understand, I'm a chill dude. Lunch arrives. Not a big deal, but I asked for extra sauce on my sandwich. Well, I got NO sauce for my troubles. No problem. I approach the counter, sandwich in hand. One, two, three employees walk by without even a sideways glance. \"Ummm, excuse me...\" I utter. Gawd, I really don't want to be \"that guy\". The young lady that took my order finally acknowledges me. \"Yes?\" Seriously? I smile, point to my dry sandwich & asked if I could get some sauce for my sandwich. She picks up the plate & dumps everything in the trash. \"I'll have them make you a new one.\" All I wanted was sauce. Then the manager appears and asks why she tossed the food in the trash, berating her in front of me. The manager muttered \"sorry\" in my general direction before disappearing to oversee the construction of my sandwich. There must be some sort of conspiratorial pact amongst the crew as my sandwich reappeared...drowning in the sauce to the point of in-edibility. I salvaged what I could from the remnants & have moved on.   The sad part is that someone truly takes pride in the product. Unfortunately, it's not the employees. Maybe I hit them on an off day. The revues are decent, but based upon my recent adventure, I probably won't be racing back soon. My advice to those of you in shitty jobs...the more miserable you feel, the longer your shift. Have fun, take care of people and earn the money they're giving you. It may not be glamorous, but you accepted the position.",

I would recommend the roast beef sandwiches over the turkey ones. I will definitely come back whenever I am in Vegas.",

I had the Full Montagu and my buddy had the Hawaiian bbq sandwich.  Both were really good.  Bread was great like everyone else says, and the flavors in the montagu were great!    we went around 9am so there wasnt much of a line but as we left PH, around 12-1pm, the line was suppper long.  Glad we skipped out on that part of this experience!",

Great sandwich at a great price (on the strip that is) but really not much more than like Jimmy John's , it is similar to how quizno's does sandwiches, but so much better. The bread is the star.

Came here with pretty high hope since people rave it like crazy but most people who came here are not exactly sober.... read the review yourself.  I got the chipotle chicken avocado... it had bacon, chicken and avocado, what can go wrong right?! Here is what I did not like, the sandwich was super tiny.... it wasn't SUPER flavor but it was decent.   My gf got the brownie bites, they are dry and not very tasty- avoid that.  My friend got the full montagu sandwich.... beef, mustard and cheese, again that sandwich was tiny for the price but it was some really sandwich.  Here is the conclusion- you would love here if you are drunk or if you are a girl or guy who doesn't eat much and get the full montagu.",

But is it sad that one of the stops I am looking forward to making is THE Earl of Sandwich?  24 hours a day 7 days a week of yummy sandwich goodness!  Been here at least four times and it has been consistently good EVERY time.  And soo soo soo soo cheap!  Can't believe I'm eating on the Las Vegas strip type of cheap!  My favorites - the Original 1762 (soo much roast beef), The Full Montagu, and the Caribbean Jerk Chicken. I'm sure anything you order here will be great - but those are my favorites.  Not just good at 4AM when you're drunk, stumbling through the deserted Miracle Mile shops of PH (which, by the way-resembles some sort of Zombie Apocalypse 4AM!) AND STILL good at 5PM the next day before a night of drinking.    The key is the quality of the bread, the meat, and sauces.  The competition needs to take a page out of Earl of Sandwich's playbook - quality over quantity.  Generous portions of meat but NOT too much meat to overdo it. Not like those other sandwich shops that just serve you the side of an animal piled up between two small slices of bread.  . Earl of Sandwich serves the perfect amounts of meat, sauce and veggies.  The process is so streamline - the line may seem long but they have fulfillment down to a science so it moves fast.  Place your order, listen for your number - done!  A word of advice - if you are a big eater - order two sandwiches.  I'm not saying they're small by any means - but they are soo good and go down so easily - you'll be craving another.  TRUST me.",

And it's not your ordinary shredded cheese, it's these huge square-diced cheese that ruined the dish. There must have been 3 or 4 different type of cheese.  The bf ordered the Mediterranean Chicken wrap and he enjoyed it. No complaints on his behalf.   Overall I would come here again when I am in town. It's a great place to come to for lunch or snack.",

    "text": "This place has many, many good Yelp reviews, so I bookmarked it a while back.  Finally, we drove to the strip and gave it a try.  It is inside the Planet Hollywood Hotel & Casino (Las Vegas Boulevard & Harmon).  The Earl is near the Southern most entrance facing the Las Vegas Strip, right next to the Sugar Factory and the sports book.  The line was really long when we arrived and the seating appeared to be full.  I hate standing in line, but that is a good sign that they are doing something right.  Surprisingly, the line moved quickly.  The Earl is known for their hot sandwiches, we ordered two:  The Original 1762 is one of their signature hot sandwiches with roast beef, sharp cheddar, and creamy horseradish sauce on an artisan baked loaf.  I enjoyed the horseradish mayo.  The French Dip is only being served for a limited time.  It has roasted beef , sauteed red onions, on an artisan baked loaf and comes with Au Jus on the side.  I think they should have given a little more Au Jus.  We added a bowl of creamy tomato soup served with burnt croutons.  Cups of ice water are free.  Their bread is pretty good, but they are a bit stingy with the meat.  They slice the sandwich in half and the meat is clumped in the center giving the appearance that it has lots of meat.  Feels a little like False advertising.  The whole bill came in around $18.  By the time we got our food there was plenty of seating.  Apparently people move through pretty quickly.  The Earl is basically fast food like Quiznos or Panera Bread.  This place has a ton of reviews because it is one of the few places on the strip for tourists to get descent food at a low price.  I would eat there again if in the area, but it is not worth the hassle of the strip just for a sandwich.  Hey locals, there are far better options off the strip.  Looking for a good sandwich in a fast food type environment?  Try Jason's Deli.",

I ordered the hawaiian bbq, and was completely in love with it!  I figured the bread might get soggy because of the sauce, but it wasn't at all!  The bread was tasty too, and very light.  I became quite the fan and made frequent visits here on my trip.  I tried the Caprese sandwich which is basically slices of mozzarella cheese and tomatoes.  This by far was my absolute favorite sandwich there.  The vinagerette was perfect with the melted cheese and the tomatoes were just perfect!    Price was decent too, if you're on a budget for food in Vegas, I'd definitely suggest Earl's, there are plenty of choices to choose from, and you'll want to try just about everything on the menu!",

Honestly it's hard to judge Earl of Sandwich accurately since when I eat it I am either drunk or hungover so it always seems like the best thing in the world. But they have a great selection. Different meats, sauces, sides, etc.  The bread is ALWAYS fresh whether it's 4 in the morning or 8 in the evening. I will admit there is only one sandwich joint in Vegas I love more. And I eat a lot of sandwiches.",

The sandwiches themselves are better than subway but about the same level as quizznos. It's just okay and my theory is the higher reviews correlate with a higher level of toxicity. I think there are better places to go like Grand Luxe at the Venetian or Secret Pizza at the Cosmopolitan.",

I'm sure many of us have fond (if rather hazey) memories of drunkenly stumbling to this place to experience the delicousness of an Earl's sandwich at 3 am.  I've tried the Full Montague, Earl's Club, and Earl's wrap. The Earl's Club is my favorite! Can't go wrong with perfectly toasted bread, bacon, and meat! The wrap is a good, healthier alternative that is quite tasty too. Consideration to stay at Planet Hollywood weighs heavily just to be close to this place.",

This place is a must go if you are looking for a relatively quick and cheap bite to eat that is affordable (5.99 each?)and tasty without overindulging at a buffet.   All their sandwiches are great! It's definitely the bread that does it for me.   Whenever visiting vegas I make it a point to have this as one of my meals, and I always buy an extra one for later munching after a night of fun or if I wake up before everyone and am too lazy to go out on my own.   Their other little extras are good too, like the ice cream sandwich and the potato salad. But definitely go for the main entree, the sandwiches.   Be aware that lines do get very long during weekends, mainly during meal hours of lunch and dinner. So be prepared to come at a different time or wait. The longest I've waited during busy periods was 30 minutes and that line started all the way at the entrance in to Planet Hollywood. It was still worth it! And their ordering system makes it such a fast and efficient line.",

Case in point, you probably don't want to go for the $5 prime rib you find in most places.  Probably.   This place, despite a silly name and slogan, makes a pretty good sandwich.  Is it the BEST (hot) sandwich.  Debatable.  Does it get bonus points for apparently being founded by the current, actual Earl of Sandwich.  Sure.  Is it interesting that it was started not in Sandwich, but rather outside of Disneyland or that his name is of course not Earl but that his business partner's name is in fact Earl.  A little.  Would it be great to be called Lord Sandwich. Yes.   In any case, they make a pretty good sandwich for $6 and have a good selection, as you can tell there because there is always a line at all times of the day.  That said, they also have pretty good hours.",

My personal favorite is, The Original.  Lines get long at the typical eating hours, so don't complain about waiting.

It's a walk-up, almost \"cafeteria style\" kind of place where they make the sandwiches to order, then give you an empty cup to fill yourself.  So no servers or anything.  The staff there is OK/pleasant, but nothing special.  Food comes up within a couple of minutes so you could take it back to room or something...  but there are usually a couple of empty tables right there (people don't really \"linger\" as it's just not that kind of place).  But prices and good food get it 5 stars.  Pretty decent people watching as everyone strolls thru \"Miracle Mile\" shopping center right next to tables.  All indoors with \"adequate\" amount of seating.  This isn't anything fancy for date night, just a good place to get lunch in the middle of \"south strip\".  Also - I ASSUME you're on foot.  The closest parking would be ridiculously far away and, really, who's dumb enough to drive down to the Strip just for a sandwich?  AND OPEN 24 HOURS!!!!  YES!!!! They do serve \"breakfast\" type sandwiches (with egg) around the 7am - 11am time frame that are pretty good.  It would be much better if they had them AFTER 11am for those of us running with a little later in the evening/wake-up times.",

So we made a pit stop there and gave it a try (it was my first time ever trying it) We had to to-go it back for the hotel since everyone was tired. When I finally got the chance to eat it, it was still warm, but not as crispy as it would have been if we were able to eat it right there when we got it.

Also, there isn't much content in it. There's more bread than anything else.  Yum? Eh. Quick? Yes. Cheap? Yes. If you're not willing to trade the content and salty factor, being quick and cheap is totally not worth it.",

They both have a very good blend of fresh ingredients. The best part of the sandwich I have to admit was the bread. The bread on the outside was nice & crispy and the inside was  melt in your mouth good.    Be aware there are often times long lines and lack of tables/chairs. Oh and opened 24hours :)",

It was toasted, soft on the inside, crunchy on the outside, juicy and spongy, and just overall wonderful. I will admit that it is often a bit overhyped.   Service Review: Self pick-up, but the people here are friendly and helped me figure out what I wanted to order.   Venue Review: There is plenty of seating at tables next to the pick-up station, and even with a group of nearly 20 people, we were able to find a spot without too much trouble.   Overall Impression: I'm a fan! Somehow their sandwiches remind me a lot of a high-end Quizno's, but it's still at a very reasonable price for Vegas, so I think it's got the bang for your buck. Next time I want to try the Montagu!",

Give me a ruben and some old fashioned chicken noodle and I'm a happy camper...  Earl of Sandwich fills half of that need.  They make a damn good sandwich.  My personal favorite it their Thanksgiving special with turkey, cranberries (not the band), dressing, and gravy.  Pretty amazing.  All the other sammies are pretty good.  If I'm staying near by ill make the walk.  If im staying more than a few blocks away, not really worth the trip.    Pros : Decent sandwich.  Not too expensive.  Cons : Long lines.

Since there's no Earl of Sandwich in the Pacific NW (but happens to be in many other states), it made me that much more curious to try it.  This location inside Planet Hollywood looks great. Even got all the Earls of Sandwich on one of the walls. Larger portrait for the actual guy responsible for creating the sandwich. I guess we can all thank him now for being such a gambling addict.  Earl of Sandwich makes their own artisan bread, basically amounting to a buttery sandwich roll that lightly toasts in their conveyor-belt oven. Each sandwich is made and toasted to order.  I had one of the signature sandwiches: the Full Montagu ($6.49). Juicy, tender slices of meat, mustard, lettuce, and tomato. The lettuce looked a bit wilted, not sure if that was from it going through the oven. Added some Grey Poupon just for the hell of it.  Frankly, the sandwich was small for the amount paid. Merely a snack in my eyes.  There are usually a couple different types of coffee, a Kona blend and a dark roast. Good coffee here, and you can help yourself for a couple bucks.  Overall, I liked what I saw. I hope to return in the future!",

I also got the mac and cheese and that is as good as a mac and cheese can get!  It was hot and just so tasty.  My friends couldn't stop eating it...

I love sandwiches and this place is definitely worth it considering what you would pay on the strip.   I usually got the Broccoli Cheddar soup, which isn't as creamy and thick as most places. It's light and delicious and the best Broccoli Cheddar soup you can get anywhere! It's only 2.99!  All the sandwiches are 5.99 and most come hot. I think those are the best ones.

Besides, four stars does mean that I'm a fan, right? Located in Planet Hollywood, it was one of the few places that I ate at during the weekend we spent in Vegas, and among everything, it was probably the best. The place is open 24 hours so that alone, earns my respect.  Surprisingly, even with the long line, it moves pretty rapidly. For larger groups, better have someone reserve your table. Even then, people demand chairs like they belong to them so you may be treated to some rude displays of human beings being human beings. I got a Caribbean Jerk Chicken sandwich, which is basically a chicken sub with spicy sauce, red peppers and banana peppers. For the most part, the sub was pretty fresh but occassionally, I would get half a pepper that was stale or slightly crusty. I wasn't sure whether it was just dry or toasted too much. Either way, that's a no-no.  Sandwiches run at about $6-8. Earl of Sandwich is a fitting name, it's definitely no King.",

Today, my husband does the ordering and we end up with 4 sandwiches.  FOUR.  I don't know what he was thinking, but now I can review them for ya'll:  The full montague has beef and turkey and is quite yummy.  Wished they put more veggies on there, but that's being picky.  I always get this.  Hawaiian BBQ (we just got off the plane from HNL:) has ham and grilled chicken with pineapple.  I like the combo.  However, since this was the last one that I ate, I was unable to finish.  The caribbean jerk is good for those who like their sammies a little spicy since it has the banana peppers.  And for a limited time, they're doing a chicken pesto sammy, that's not too bad either.  It stood out a little less for me, since it didn't have the sweetness of the Hawaiian nor the spiciness of the Caribbean.  I think my fave is still the montague, but that's b/c I always prefer sliced meats to grilled chicken.  I think a yelper mentioned that there is a coupon out there for 50% off.  Wished we had one of those tonight.  Still, prices are reasonable for about $7/sandwich.",

My fiance and his buddies are in love with the potato and macaroni salad so I'm sure those wont be disappointing.   The ordering system works well and quick -- it's the waiting for your food to come out that makes you anxious. I would suggest having someone grab a table while the other person waits in line to order as seats tend to fill up during their busy times and I'm sure you wouldn't want to enjoy your Earls while standing.   Delicious sandwiches at a reasonable price (~$5-$6) that is pretty filling -- definitely beats spending $40+ for a buffet with over an hour wait when in Vegas.",

I have been fortunate enough to enjoy The 1762, The Club, The Full Montagu, Cannonballs, and Caribbean Jerk Chicken.  The 1762 with its simple combination of roast beef, horseradish and cheddar is hard to beat, but the Full Montagu is a close second.  I suggest ordering both for a meal, and getting a Cannonballs to go, because eating a meatball sub cold after a night of debauchery is an experience that can't really be beat.  Oh, one more thing, please, for the love of all that is holy to you, do not forget to get an Brownie Ice Cream Sandwich.

The sandwich was okay at best, not much filling, the fresh made bread is a nice touch but didn't add tremendously to the sandwhich.  To top it all off it wasn't even busy but it took a couple in front of me and myself 20 minutes to get our sandwhices after we had ordered them.  My receipt said 10:05, I didn't have my sandwich until after 10:23 when I last looked at my watch.  My buzzer went off after about 10 minutes and I stood at the counter and there was no sandwich or anyone there, after the buzzer was going off for awhile someone finally came around the corner to ask what I had ordered and said \"oh\" and yelled down to the end of the line my sandwhich order, so they hadn't even started it when my buzzer was going off!  Sandwich was maybe a 2 out of 5.  Service a 1 out of 5.",

While I admit that I have been there a bunch of times,I won't go out of my way to come here. The sandwiches are tasty and come in a variety of favorites, but none of them really made me think \"I need to come back the next time I'm in Vegas\".  Tuna Melt - Good stuff. Warm, slightly gooey and hearty. I do make sure to add some hot sauce or horseradish because the sandwich is a bit one note  Italian - All the standard italian meats plus capicola, which is my favorite. A bit of a kick with the acid and spices  Hawaiian BBQ - The most memorable of the sandwiches I've eaten. The sweetness and tangyness of the sauce and pineapple is great. The chicken is tender. One of my favorites  The Original - Classic roast beef. The beef is tender but a bit dry sometimes. The horseradish adds a much needed kick to an otherwise simple flavor profile. I wish it came with some kind of au jus  The bread for the sandwiches is fantastic though. Soft interior with a slightly crispy exterior. Great contrast. Overall, a place I'd hit up if I'm hungry, poor and on that side of the strip.",

I also got a side of mac and cheese which was also bomb dot com hehe. Can't wait to be back for some drunchies in two weeks! :D  Holiday Turkey is their special thanksgiving time one and it was so good. I thought cranberry and stuffing in a sandwich would be weird. FALSE! it is delicious. It is literally a thanksgiving meal in sandwich form. Stuffing, gravy, turkey and cranberry sauce. GENIUS.  The chipotle chicken is a little spicy with avocado and bacon pieces I think. (I don't know I was eating it in the dark tbh LOL ) but it was good. probably my least favorite one, but all my friends say its their favorite.  Full montagu. its the creamy sandwich that you've been looking for. I think its ham or pastrami or something. suuuuper good since I love cheesy dairy things. :3",

There is always line but don't let that deter you from trying this out!  It takes 10 minutes maybe even less to stand in line, order and get your food.  My new goal in life is to try every sandwich here and I definitely see more vegas trips in my future.  So far I can cross off the Caprese, Original 1762 and the Holiday Turkey.  The Caprese consists of mozzarella, tomatoes, basil and drizzled with basalmic vinaigrette!  It was exactly like a Caprese salad in sandwich form.  The Original 1762 has slices of roast beef, cheddar and horseradish sauce.  The horseradish sauce is perfect and really makes the sandwich.  Now last but certainly not least is the Holiday Turkey!  After one bite, I just wanted to make out with that sandwich.  It was a unique thanksgiving sandwich for me because I had never come across one with stuffing before.  And boy did it make a difference.  The stuffing was soaked in gravy and kept the sandwich very moist!  And the turkey, cranberry sauce and seasoned mayo was good as well. But sadly the Holiday Turkey is seasonal and will be offered until January 8th.   It's open 24 hours so there's no excuse for you not being able to try it!  I have so much love for the buns of the earl of sandwich!",

It's cheap and the only place within walking distance that even sells salads this early in the a.m. (they're open 24-hours), not to mention that I actually really ENJOY eating them.   So I'm staying across the street at the Aria and I make the trek through City Center, across the bridge, through treacherous construction and finally through the PH casino all for this salad.  I didn't get my salad.   The girl behind the counter said they weren't available. I assumed they were out of a vital ingredient since I've ordered this salad plenty of times at this hour. She said they might have the salad later that afternoon but I could order a wrap instead. I was mystified by this since they were the same ingredients but in a pita??? After pressing the issue I discovered that the reason she couldn't sell me the salad was they were out of the proper container. Seriously.  I asked if I could order it and have it served in cups or any other container they had available, I just really wanted the f***ing salad. She had the nerve to look at me like I was crazy!  She obviously isn't going to win any awards for creative problem solving but she not only lost a sale that day (and the whole rest of the weekend!) but she lost 2 stars as well.  Note to Management: I still really dig your food and will most definitely visit again but you may want to have a meeting with your employees regarding customer satisfaction and thinking \"outside the box\".",

However, when I got it, it definitely didn't look like oatmeal. It was super watery and looked like it hasn't been cooked. Water with stuff just floating around in it. I asked the girl if that's what it was supposed to look like and she said yes. I asked her if I could trade it for something else and after she asked me what other kind of soup I wanted, I told her I wanted a bagel. Clearly that's how watery it was if she described it as soup. They graciously gave me a bagel instead.  Ill definitely return but for sandwiches only. Stick with what I know and love.",

I figured you can't beat $80 for a night when it usually runs $250.  In looking for a place to eat we decided to stay inside.  Of course I pulled up my handy Yelp app on my phone and said \"hey, we should try this place.. Earl.. of Sandwich..\"  Girlfriend said yes and we headed down.  The place was pretty packed for mid afternoon, but as I got close I could tell why.  The aroma that filled the air quickly covered up the sweat and machine smell from the machines in the casino.    I ordered their new chicken chipotle sandwich.   Ok,  l love sandwiches, but honestly... usually sandwiches are sandwiches, but let me tell ya what, Earl knows their sandwich.  The service was wonderful and the food was even more delicious than the smell itself.   The only bad part was that I tend to eat good food too quickly.. and yeah, my sandwich was awesome.    Earl was so good that we went back for breakfast before we headed out.    That's gotta say something for this place.. twice in 24 hours?  Oh yeah.",

The feta cheese inside really makes this sandwich! One would think that a sandwich that includes no meat would be ordinary and bland.  This is far from the opposite with the Veggie.  I came back the next day because all I could think about was my sandwich.  I decided to try the Caprese the second time.  Compared to the Veggie, the Caprese had a light, mildly sweet taste.  It oozed with gooey mozzarella goodness.  I'm now back in California, and cannot stop thinking about Earl of Sandwich. I am really contemplating about driving all the way to Vegas just so I can satiate my craving.   C'mon, Earl of Sandwich!  Y'all need to set up a SoCal location!!!",

We also ordered their Mac and cheese and that was super amazing as well. Highly recommend both items. My brother ordered the Italian and that was also great. Second time around I ordered the tuna melt and that was good too but I recommend the montuge or whatever it's called over the tuna and the Italian. As a matter a fact writing the review makes me want to go there for brunch before we leave. I must admit this may have became my mandatory go to in Vegas from here on out!!!

Simple, yet gorgeous. My boyfriend and I shared one as an after-club snack and on the last bite of my boyfriend's sandwich, he dropped the last meatball on the floor.

Either way, I am so glad that they have vegetarian alternatives that taste just as good as their regular meat sandwiches :)",

PLEASE?!?  *sigh*  :(  Yeah, there's not much more one can say about Earls that hasn't already been said.  It's become a Vegas staple for me and my friends.  Their sandwiches blow every other sandwich chain out of the water.  Yes, I'm talking to you Subway and Quiznos.  They use high quality, fresh ingredients and everything is made to order.  And at $5.99 a sandwich, it's a steal!  I used to think the Full Monagu was the best, but I've come to realize that THE ORIGINAL is the way to go.  Freshly roasted beef, cheddar and creamy horseradish sauce on their signature hot, toasty artisan bread.  *drool*  Don't worry, the horse radish isn't overpowering at all.  I also like the tuna melt, but wasn't really a fan of the Caribbean jerk chicken.  I'm going to try Cannonballs! next time.  Wait can be as long as 20-30 minutes during lunch time, but it's totally worth it once you find a sandwich you love.  Now open 24 hours.",

We came around noontime-ish, and the line moved fairly fast. I ended up ordering the Hawaiian Chicken Sandwich with an Earl Tea Lemonade, which came up to ~$10. As for the price, it wasn't too bad. The sandwich was decent -- it wasn't like, \"OMG I'M HAVING A MOUTHGASM THIS VERY MOMENT. I WANT IT EVERYDAY\" sorta thing. It was just..... good. In fact, the only thing that makes this sandwich good was the fact that it was all about the BREAD! It was heated to perfection, which made the cheese melt and the meat to be all sorts of steamy. My drink was eh.  The interior was like a fancy subway, nothing too fancy.  Overall, it was good-- wasn't super amazing like everyone claims. However, this place is a good place to eat, especially if you're low on cash in Vegas. As for coming back, maybe. I wouldn't say I'm a super fan, but it is good.  Turn Ons: -The bread of the sandwich was good-- truly baked to perfection.  Turn Offs: -Way too overrated-- only the bread is good.",

We got there placed our order and Yelpers sure as hell did not disappoint!   I got the Earl Club: turkey, bacon, lettuce, tomato and special sandwich sauce. Oh my was this yummy, the sandwich was warmed to the perfect temperature, the bread was the perfect crunchy yummy goodness, and the inside of it left nothing else to be desired. What I most loved was that the sandwich kept its shape the whole way through and never got messy.   I had worked up an appetite and this really hit the spot. I'm glad I made the sacrifice to walk the two miles, because it was sure worth it!",

We had the sad realization that many of the food options at the Rio closed at 1:00 PM!  Say what?!  Sadly, we have no will power and could not wait.   We started off with the Original (Roasted beef, sharp cheddar & horseradish sauce) - The horseradish was just the right amount to highlight the beef, nice subtle, but strong beef flavor, yum!  We followed that with the Caribbean Jerk Chicken (Grilled chicken, roasted red peppers, banana peppers & spicy jerk sauce) - really nice kick to it, made it a very nice contrast with the more laid back original.  We continued on with the Full Montagu (Roasted beef, turkey, Swiss, sharp cheddar, lettuce, tomato & mustard sauce) - this was the weakest of the 3.  I really liked it the last time, but it did not compare to the other 2 we had.  For breakfast tomorrow?  The Hawaiian BBQ (Grilled chicken, ham, Swiss, pineapple & Hawaiian BBQ sauce).    And yeah, no lunch tomorrow =(",

I had to double check the sticker on the wrapper to make sure I didn't get some sort of Italian chicken sandwich. There was no jerk flavor whatsoever.

Most of the time it's their shows, their buffets, they're world class restaurants...   That's why when I stayed at Planet Hollywood last week, I had a Laugh Out Loud moment when I kept seeing this 'Earl Of Sandwich' sandwich shop promotion everywhere. I mean seriously, from the moment you walk into Planet Hollywood at check-in... to the elevator rides up... to the adverts in your room... they keep promoting a sandwich shop? LOL.  Well guess what, all the adverts worked and I finally gave in to try this place on my last night in Vegas- and i'm very glad i did!   The sandwich was actually awesome! I got the 'All American'... thick slices of turkey, visibly fresh lettuce and tomato, melted American and Swiss cheese on toasted bread, all topped off with cranberry sauce...   Maybe it's because i was far from home and had been sick of eating buffets all week long- this sandwich just stood out as delicious. Be sure to use the coupon found in your VIP booklet! I think it's buy one get one free? I grabbed another one before i checked out the next morning for the long drive home ;) A 4 star Sandwich Shop.",

Although it constantly sports a long line, the Earl is one of the cheapest, filling meals you can grab in the City of Sin (short of trekking to one of the over-franchised food court locations). Compared to food around the world, the Earl wouldn't earn a full five stars. But when you take into account that you're on the strip, probably some degree of hungover or drunk, and looking to save your money for alcohol, gambling, and female escorts, it's probably one of your best bet in the area.  I enjoyed my sandwich much more than my other dining companions seemed to enjoy theirs, but then again, I went with their \"famous hot sandwich\" - The Original 1762. It sports a huge pile of roast beef, sharp cheddar, and plenty of creamy horseradish sawwce.  The Earl is open 24 hours. I don't usually crave sandwiches at 4 in the morning in Vegas. But when I do, I make sure it's an Earl of Sandwich.",

    "text": "Huh.  Not understanding the enthusiasm about this place.  I mean, OK.  It IS fast (counter service only) and cheap (by Vegas terms, anyway).  Sandwiches run about $6.  But they're not that great.  I had Le Frenchy, which is ham, brie, and dijon mustard.  It was OK, but I couldn't even detect the brie on the sandwich, which was the entire reason I ordered it in the first place.  Liz C. had the ultimate grilled cheese, which was supposed to have three different types of cheese on it (and bacon!), and you could barely detect the cheese on *her* sandwich.  The bread everyone is raving about tastes a lot like Schlotzsky's bread to me - which, you know, is fine, just not \"special.\"  I also tried one of their cupcakes with sprinkles and it was kind of gross.  I've made yellow cakes out of a box that tasted better than this thing did.    Considering the culinary mecca that Vegas is supposed to be, I've had limited success at finding really great food here.  The Earl of Sandwich at least succeeds in being reasonably priced, but I can think of several sandwich places at home that could beat the Earl with both hands tied behind their back.",

The Italian sandwich was awesome and, as others have mentioned, not too salty. I especially love how the bread was crispy on the outside and fluffy on the inside. I also got a side of tomato soup, which was deliciously creamy. The croutons lost their molecular integrity (read: turned soggy), but they still tasted good. All this with an Earl's Grey Lemonade (sort of like their version of an Arnold Palmer) made me a happy camper. Will definitely be back!",

Their sweet assembly line system makes it so that I never have to wait too long to devour the toasty, melty, meaty, cheesy goodness! These little brick-shaped sandwiches pave the way to a mind-blown yet comfortably full Sarah. However, just because I'm comfortably full doesn't mean I don't want to order an extra sandwich or two...or three.  I get the Meatball Hero (Cannonballs!) every time. Meatballs + marinara + mozzarella is all I need. I swear to myself every time that I'll try a new sandwich...but the furthest I've gone is to swap half of the bf's Italian (which is also ridiculously good).   Don't waste your time with the sides/desserts, they're expensive. Just order another sandwich instead! Sandwich with a side of sandwich, duh.   Come to California, Goddamnit!",

We were starving around 1am after an early dinner buffet and spending hours in the casinos. We weren't up for wandering too far or spending too much more money on a late night snack, so Earl of Sandwich it was.  We got the the Hawaiian BBQ, Cannonballs and Carribean Jerk Chicken sandwiches and shared them among three people so that everyone could try everything. All three were amazing. The sandwiches aren't huge but the portions are perfect and I can't complain about the price for the quality. I didn't imagine a meatball sandwich that could stand out amongst all other meatball sandwiches but oh man, the Earl of Sandwich Cannonballs meatball sandwich was amazing. I can't really describe what makes it so good, but it just was.  Fast, affordable, and open all the time. Best sandwich place I've been to, hands down. Hoping to come back to Vegas soon to relive the glory (food-wise, not the losing money part.)",

I had the hawaiian which was really good.  Size wise.. it's not a large sandwich, and if you're super hungry get two, but honestly I think the size is good.  The sandwich was yummy and the bread was wonderful as others have mentioned.    Every time I walked by there was a huge line.. no doubt thanks to Yelp.

    "text": "Okay if I could I would give this 24 Hour place a 4.5 Star rating and here's why.  I ended up trying this place partially because I wanted to see what the best cheap eats in Las Vegas were. So I went there one day and grabbed a late lunch, and when I took my first bite it was absolutely wonderful. So much better than any sandwich I've had in Canada.   I love their full Montagu sandwich, it was tasty, delicious and of great value. (In Canada are food portions are usually smaller than the U.S, so for me the sandwich was a good size.) The bun is always crispy but not hard so that it rips the roof of your mouth. (not a fan of hard breads) and the way that everything just melds is amazingly simple yet is a melt in your mouth experience that is hard to describe.  During my stay in Vegas I ate there 3 times and each sandwich has always made my stomach smile. (I remember one was Hawaiian, but I can't remember the 3rd). The only downfall is that if you are a bit of health nut then you may want to watch out for the sodium levels. I know they are quite high.   But what most people may not mention is that their salads are absolutely great for the price you pay. Salads are never prepackaged and suffocating in a plastic container. They are made fresh and taste wonderful. The pricing of around 6 bucks for a salad is almost unheard of in Las Vegas.   At the end if you're looking for a sandwich and salad meal for under $13 US, definitely go to Earl. You can't get better value.   Considering what the cost of other meals in Vegas are, this is a great place for bachelors and people who are with a family and budget conscious.",

The sandwiches were decent enough size to give you a comfortable \"full\" feel after a sandwich and a half. The bread was tasty and the meat tasted fresh.   My girlfriend and I were feeling ballsy, so we ended up sharing three sandwiches: All-American, Full Montagu, and Caribbean Jerk Chicken.  The All-American was definitely on the top of the list with its fresh taste and sweetness added on by cranberries. This place just seems to have everything in order.  Would definitely go back for a lunch, maybe not so much a dinner, but this place is open 24/7.",

The sandwiches are made to order so they don't have any pre-made sandwiches. That's why it can take longer than other casual dining places.  All the sandwiches I've tried, they've been all really delicious and addicting. I'd definitely come back every time I'm in Vegas (even though there are other locations throughout USA) because I like it that much. Only thing I'd say that needs improvement is their cleanliness at the actual restaurant - many people don't clean up after themselves so there can be lots of garbage lying around, or sticky messes, etc.",

My friends and I packed our bags, got in the car, and made the 8.5 hour car ride after work to Vegas.  Sandwiches are in my top 3 things to eat. I love them. Period.  The first thing you'll notice are how LOW the PRICES are compared to everything in Vegas. Great food for under $7??? YES! ONLY AT EARL OF SANDWICH.  --HOT SANDWICHES-- I must admit, I was here twice in one day. Their sandwiches are made to order, use great ingredients, and are toasted in their very own Artisan baked loaf.   I started off with the CHIPOTLE CHICKEN AVOCADO for $6.50 which included grilled chicken, cheddar cheese, avocado, lettuce, tomato, and chipotle sauce. Simple ingredients, amazing combination, definitely recommend this one.  Later that night I had THE ORIGINAL 1726 for $6.50 which included roast beef, cheddar cheese, and horseradish sauce. This was especially great on a cold night. This warm sandwich really hit the spot and the roast beef was delicous.  --CONCLUSION-- Whenever I'm in Vegas, I make sure to stop by Earl of Sandwich at least once. And yes, some of my friends make fun of me for that...but I don't care. Not only is it extremely affordable for The Strip, they make awesome hot sandwiches, AND they're open 24 HOURS! There is often a long line, so if you're truly looking for a quick meal, you may want to avoid this place. If there is a short line, you better hop in quick!  Until my next review...HAPPY EATING AND TRAVELING!  Tyler",

I ordered the Roast Beef/ Turkey sandwhich, just to play it safe. The sandwhich was very flavorful and quite tasty!  The subs were priced reasonabley(especially for the strip) at 5.99-6.49 each. The room is very nice and clean and the employees were friendly and the food was served quite fast. We went to eat towards the back since it was quite noisy around the bar/perimeter seats. Some people might like those seats so they can people watch and be \"close to the action\".  My only complaint was the size of the sandwhiches. They were kinda small and I was still hungry when I was finished! There should be an option for a larger size! i want more! lol   I will say it is probably the second tastiest sub I've gotten in Vegas. Firehouse just seems to be a smidgen better IMO. Maybe after I try a few more menu items, I'll reconsider that stance, but thats where I stand for now.  I'll definately be back for more though...  4 stars!",

    "text": "Earl makes a pretty solid sandwich and it's decently priced, according to and not according to Vegas standards.  $6-7 for a filling sandwich is okay in my book.  First sandwich on my mind was the Caribbean Jerk and I'm always inclined to get sandwiches that don't have the typical deli meat in it.  I was a little disappointed that the flavor level just wasn't what I was expecting.  It was pretty mild but nothing a little hot sauce can't enhance.  Second sandwich was really a toss up between the Full Montagu and the Tuna Melt.  I love tuna melts but I never order this one because it just seems to lack uniqueness compared to other sandwiches that shops can make. Turns out I loved it here!  I like that the melted swiss was right in the middle of two thick layers of tuna.  It really helped highlight the cheese and bind all of it together.  Tuna was plentiful and not watery.  If I could go back in time, I would get the Full Montagu instead of the Caribbean Jerk.  I do like the bread because it's warm and on the dense side.  I wouldn't call it gourmet like Acme or Tartine but sometimes you just want good, normal bread without all the crunch and holes.",

Demolished the soup and was so full from the cheesiness of the soup. Delicious!  Enjoyed my sandwich a couple hours later, which also left my backpack smelling incredibly tasty. The italian sauce left it a bit oily, but it was still good hours later! A rarity for a hot sandwich. Plenty of meat, delicious foccacia bread to absorb it all.  I just wish we had one here closer (they did open a location recently in Anaheim) and I choose to eat this over all the other foods in Vegas!",

    "text": "This past Vegas trip I went on for a friends' birthday, I had Earls three days in a row. You'd think I would be sick of it but I wasn't! It made my stomach happy but more importantly, it made my wallet happier (darn school loans).  Located at the Miracle Mile Shops in Planet Hollywood. You get in line, order your food, pay at the end, and grab a buzzer. When that buzzer starts vibrating, it'll be the best feeling in the world because your food is ready! They have plenty of sandwiches to choose from and sides as well. From pasta salad and potato salad to cookies and chips, pick your poison. The prices here are really inexpensive and affordable, which is great since you're going to be blowing your money on other things. Like TeeFlii, it's open for 24 hourzzz  I should probably try new things but my go-to sandwich here is the Chipotle Chicken Avocado hot sandwich. ZOMG hands down my favorite sandwich. You really can't go wrong with chipotle, chicken, and avocado. It's a very hearty sandwich with loads of flavors that will make your taste buds go wild. I also tried one of the breakfast sandwiches, it's called the egg white avocado bagel thin (?) something like that. Honestly, it wasn't that great; it was very plain and bland but it got the job done and \"healthy\". I'd stick to their specialty sandwiches!  Earls is perfect for lunch, dinner, or the late night drunchies.",

It might be a little tough to find Earl of Sandwich but just use a map (if you are sober) or ask around. Sandwiches used to cost anywhere from $5 to $7 but now it's all one price... I believe $6 each. Plus within the last year they significantly cut down the menu.   My favorite sandwich is/was the Carribean Jerk Chicken, but I have now settled for the Chicken Chipotle. For me, the sandwiches are kinda dry because of the bread, but I love that they are always hot and delicious! One of the ultimate Vegas cravings.",

It's so yummy with the melty, cheese-like sauce and the banana peppers that add a crunch and some more heat. Okay it's not really spicy because I wish they had more hot sauces available besides spicy mustard and Tabasco on the table. But ah I daydream about this sandwich. It's feels like a healthier cheesesteak sandwich, but it probably isn't. But Jimmy crack corn and I don't care, I love this sandwich!",

This place is a typical strip mall sandwich shop that is located in Planet Hollywood / Miracle Mile Shops. The sandwiches are average at best, the soup was pretty good, the salads were actually pretty much like a house salad at a low end restaurant. The worst part is the service. We stood in line about 15 minutes to place our order, then waited 30 minutes and never got our order. When I went back to the counter to inquire about our order, they had \"lost\" the order. They said it would be a couple of minutes and they would bring it out to the table. About 10 minutes later we got the food order, but it was wrong and we waited another 5 minutes for them to correct it. Do your self a favor and find another place to eat, This place needs different staff or management to get this place straightened out..",

Also, the salad is not as fresh as possible, and some of the lettuce had brown spots.  I highly recommend the Tuna Melt, the Club, and the Cannonball. Also, the tomato soup as a side is delectable.

Biting into my sandwich it was served warm and well balanced and not pouring out the back upon biting into it. The BBQ sauce was sweet and complimented it all real well along with the toasty bread. I hate to say it but after a late night on the strip i usually run for the boarder and hit taco bell on the way home but i think im going to try making this place my stop like so many others have said they do as i think its the perfect time for something like this... try it out you will not be disappointed.",

Next I'm looking around for some tissues or paper towels or whatever's c'mon people its the same! And I ask this lady setting stuff up near the soda machine and she just gives this expression of disbelief for not saying paper towels WTF, you know what I'm talking about just point.

I was very happy to see that my Original has toasty bread, not oily at all! When I read any ingredients such as mustard or horseradish, I immediately think sour tangy, which isn't my taste at all. But I was wrong. The moment I bit in, I was happy that all the ingredients complimented each other! The beef was soft, the spreads and cheese were not salty, you could taste everything altogether. Boyfriend and I switched the second half of our sandwiches. He had Full Montagu, which was also very delicious! I just wish this wasn't the only Earl in Vegas :(",

Come to think of it, I probably spent more time here than I did in my hotel room! Between my boyfriend and I we tried 7 of the 13 hot sandwiches they offer. They were all amazing but the best by far (in my opinion) was the \"Hawaiin BBQ\" and the \"Caprese\" sandwiches. Another reason this place rocks is because they are open 24 hours a day. Whether you coming to Earls to enjoy a nice lunch or you stumble upon this place in a drunken stupor, it will not disappoint. I will definitely be back here the next time I'm in Vegas.",

I ordered the holiday turkey sandwich (oven-roasted turkey, hearty stuffing, zesty cranberry sauce, seasoned mayo, and warm gravy). It was one of the best sandwiches I've ever eaten! It's like Thanksgiving dinner in a sandwich! DEE-LICIOUS! My only complaint is that I wish the bread was heartier. It would have been nice if they didn't use a bread that was so soft because it can get a little soggy. I usually like my bread to be toasted to a nice crisp on the outside and still soft on the inside. The sandwich was also smaller than I expected, but well worth $5.99. That's pretty cheap for Vegas standards.   We also grabbed a bag of the salt & vinegar kettle chips (skip this! The chips were all stuck together.), macaroni salad (ok. Tastes store bought.), strawberry yogurt parfait.  I will definitely come back for the Holiday sandwich and to try some of the other sandwiches.  I also think that it's great that this place is open 24 hours!",

Read all the hype, was hungry, didn't want to spend a ton....the location is cool because its right in the PH casino, so lots of people watching/table betting going on right there + open 24 hrs.  I ordered the \"original\" and tomato soup (no fries, just chips - I skipped this).  Just over $10.  Cool, right?  Took it back to my hotel....was dying to eat it, and was impressed with soup - very creamy and tasty.  Then, came the sandwich....not that great to begin with.....just did not like the meat taste/consistency.......then, toward, the end I bit into, like a small plastic disc (dime size) - had no idea it was there until the end and was totally grossed out.  I would have complained but it was already 1 am and I'll never go there again anyway, so......there was no line when I went and staff was friendly, quick service, packed nice to carry back......but just not worth it.  I've had plenty of better sandwiches from both local and chain places in Chicago, so Goodbye, Earl - sorry, people, but go somewhere else.  2 stars for location ( they have multiple locations around LV), ambience in PH and friendly staff....",

A meal, side, drink, and dessert for around $12 over here.  Beware of the long lines for lunch, but they move pretty damn quick.  -  Everyone who waits in these lines knows wassup.  If you lost a lot of money at the tables.  Go to Earl of Sandwich! If a stripper took you for all your money.  Go to Earl of Sandwich! If you just got rejected at the club.  Go to Earl of Sandwich! If a group of girls try to get you to buy them breakfast.  Go to Earl of Sandwich! If you wake up hungover after the paramedics left your room the night before laughing at you for being stupid drunk.  Go to Earl of Sandwich! If Planet Hollywood or any hotel doesn't want to comp you a free meal for losing hella $$$ to their shitty dealers.  Go to Earl of Sandwich!

WAY too much sauce overwhelming the toppings.  I almost gave it A-Ok for the price, as It will temporarily fill you, but I have to minus a star for the HORRIBLE coffee and the TREMENDOUS amount of waste. sandwich comes from toaster over conveyor-belt, is wrapped and sticker used to close wrapper. Then wrapped in napkins, then stuffed in plastic bag. No reusable cups, cutlery, anything. When I said \"no bag, I'm just eating it here\" they looked at me like I was crazy and bagged everything anyways. I got to walk four steps, sit down and discard the plastic bag.  If whole wheat was an option, the coffee was not total garbage and they offered a plate or a basket even, I would return. Not worth it.",

Whether you're going for breakfast, lunch, dinner, or for a LATE night snack (they're open 24 hours, btw), you will love this place. I once went 4 times in 3 days on a Vegas trip, and make it a point to go at least once on each trip.  You may like variety and you may like switching things up every now and then, but my recommendation is to always go with The Original 1762 (freshly roasted beef, cheddar cheese & creamy horseradish sauce). The bread is amazingly good, too, because it is only half-baked before they make your sandwich. When they send it through the conveyor belt oven, the entire sandwich gets heated/baked to perfection.  My top 4 reasons for going to Earl of Sandwich: 1) The Original 1762 is absolutely delicious! 2) The prices are fantastically low! 3) It's open 24/7 4) Service is fast  Give this place a try, you will not regret it!",

This location is very convenient for us (depends on where you're staying, of course), and the sandwiches are delicious! Their menu is simple, and you can also choose between wheat or white bread. My personal favorites are the Chipotle Chicken Avocado and the Hawaiian BBQ. The Hawaiian BBQ has pineapples in it (like Hawaiian Pizza), and it's tangy, sour, and sweet. I definitely recommend this flavor!  They also offer a variety of sweets, such as muffins, cookies, and cupcakes, as well as refrigerated cut fruits and salads. I personally can't vouch for their taste though, as I've never tried them.",

I wanted to grab a few sandwiches before heading to EDC, and I was wondering if they had online ordering.. and YES they do! Just google it. If you don't have a car (or even if you do), it's super convenient. Food here is prepped really fast. Walk up to the cashier and they should be able to help you (be assertive here!).  Sometimes the line can get long, so yes I still recommend ordering ahead (I am a huge fan of ordering ahead anywhere lol).  I had this thanksgiving leftovers sandwich this time. Yes bomb diggity. Fat slices of turkey, cranberry, stuffing.. the whole nine yards of November  I want it now!!  My friends ALL got the Hawaiian one and they said it was good too.   I've never had a bad 'wich here. You actually can NOT go wrong. Ugh droooool. Please send some my way",

If you're hungry, one sandwich will not be enough.  Since they are opened 24 hours a day, they are a nice place to go to late at night to get something small to eat.  I will be back, but if you're planning to eat here for lunch or dinner, you will most likely need to order two sandwiches to meet your appetite.",

The tomato soup is filled with soggy crouton I can't believe they do it. They even pore the soup over the croutons to really make it terrible so ask for them on the side.   The salad bar is okay but not very quick process to make it.   They will hand you a sandwich is a bag that is ALWAYS greasy. The bag handles are guaranteed to be slimy when it's handed to you, I just don't get whey they do that.   I'll certainly be back again and recommend to try them out.   They can get busy at times but line moves pretty fast and food comes out warm and toasted.   Thanks Earl of Sandwich!",

You have to come at the right time because there can be a long line. It usually goes by fast and so worth the wait!  I would recommend stopping for a late nice meal,or a quick meal for the plane ride. You will not regret it at all!",

And after hitting up Earl, while it was organized, I probably waited just as long for my very inexpensive sandwich than I would have for a gourmet burger. Oh, well.  Quick to take my order at the register, I was handed a receipt and got to walk past the cooler of bottled drinks, salad items and desserts. I managed to say no to all of that. At the register, my total was rung up, including a cup into which I poured a whole lot of delightful Earl Grey lemonade. And then I waited. And waited. And watched some \"brahs\" yelling and being drunk Spring Breakers. And waited some more. And after 10 minutes, I got my sandwich to go.  The sandwich was quite good. The bread was excellent (I understand they bake it themselves), the sliced roast beef was perfect and the tangy horseradish sauce was great.  Yep, a good and inexpensive sandwich.",

You get a buzzer that tells you when your food is ready.  It's quite handy because this is a very busy location.  This gives you time to get your drink and find a table.  I noticed the sandwiches come out sooner than the salads.  The salad ingredients were chopped into perfect bite-sized pieces.  The chicken was okay, slightly rubbery because it came cold.  The dressing was decent.  If you're starving, this is a good place to get a salad.  However, if you're really looking for a delicious salad, you might consider waiting to find a restaurant that isn't known for its sandwiches.",

    "text": "Decided to visit after I read the reviews on Yelp.  The line situation is strange.  First, there is an interrogator at the beginning of the line that attempts to discover which type of sandwich you are getting.  He then gives you a receipt for that sandwich, and proceeds to tell you that the drink and chips can be ordered at the end of the line.  So...this guy's purpose in life at this restaurant is to determine which sandwich you want?  Ok....fine.  I will play along.  I ordered the Reuben.  He printed out my receipt.  I paid for the sandwich, my fiance's sandwich, a bag of chips, and two drinks at the end of the line.  They then gave me these nifty lighted thingys that will inform me when my sandwich is completed and ready for pickup.  Ok...organized....good.  To my surprise the lighted up thing went off about 5 minutes into the wait.  I thought \"cool...I get my sandwich before these other people that were way ahead of me in line...it must be because of my total rewards tier credit...they are treating me right!\"    WRONG.  First, EOS told me they do not take part in the Total Rewards, which sucks, and the reason they turned on the lighted thing was to tell me they had no Pastrami.    So....let me get this straight.  You have a guy whose sole job is to determine your sandwich order...that's his job...sandwich ordering...knowing what is present in the restaurant and what is needed etc.....and he screwed it up?  How does a sandwich restaurant not have Pastrami?  That would be like Santa with no reigndeer, Books with no learnin', staying home sick and not watching Price is Right.  The first layer of defense in telling me a worldwide pastrami shortage threatened Vegas failed with the sandwich receipt guy and the second layer of defense failed with the final cashier ringing me up for a sandwich that did not exist at that restaurant at that time.  Technology just rolled over in its grave...",

The second time I came here was last week, around 10:45am - very short line and the food still tasted great.  I highly recommend ordering the Full Montagu hot sandwich. The roast beef is so tender and the mustardy sauce they lace their sandwich with adds a delicious kick.

Pretty much nothing can go wrong with whatever you order, but my favorites (as well as my friends) were the Tuna Melt and the Hawaiian one. May I re-emphasize: SO GOOODDDDD!

Thank goodness there's news of one being opened at downtown disney in the near future! The bread is just so delicious and the amount of tuna that gets sandwiched in between is perfect. My mouth waters every time I think about it. I didn't understand why my friends would bring back so many sandwiches whenever they came back from Vegas, but now I completely understand. It's nothing like any tuna sandwich I've ever had!",

    "text": "I went here for the first time, and we had the Jerk Chicken and the Original based on previous yelp reviews.  The sandwiches were individually-wrapped and served pleasantly hot.  The bread was also quite good, mostly because it was freshly toasted.  The Original had a healthy stack of roast beef topped with horseradish sauce and cheddar cheese, and it was the favorite of the two.  The beef had a nice chew to it, which I attribute to moisture and freshness, things that low-quality roast beef lack.  The toppings, not surprisingly, complemented the beef nicely.  The Jerk Chicken was topped with a special sauce and banana peppers.  The chicken was a little disappointing, as it had the texture of the chicken in those microwavable, frozen meals.  I wouldn't be surprised if indeed the chicken WAS cooked, frozen, and simply reheated at the restaurant.  Nonetheless, the overall flavor was decent.  We also had the tomato soup, which was a tasty bisque with crispy croutons.  While nothing surprising or elegant, the soup was delightfully reminiscent of chef boyardee.  Overall, I felt that the food here tasted (and was) mass-produced, and thus it lacked nuance as well as freshness.  And, not surprisingly, the lines were long.  Nonetheless, it was satisfying sober, so I can only imagine how dreamy it would be drunk (yup, that alliteration was intended).  Bottom line:  Food here is produced for the masses.  I would eat here again, although honestly, if a Subway opened up next door, I would face a serious dilemma.",

    "text": "Earl of Sandwich is located in the Planet Hollywood hotel. All the sandwiches are $5.99 (which is a steal in vegas). Think Quizno's but 100 times better in flavor and in quality.   Earl of Sandwich offers several specialty sandwiches, all toasted on their famous artisan bread. When I first approached Earl of Sandwich, the line was wrapped around the corner, and I cringed, thinking I would have to wait an eternity before I could get my hands on one of their tasty sandwiches.   To my surprise, the line went by quite quickly, and we got our food order within 10 minutes. Not too shabby, especially with the mob that was surrounding the place.    Highlights:  Club: Turkey, bacon, lettuce tomato, sandwich sauce. subbed out sauce for their house mustard which is a mix of dijon and honey mustard. The sandwich was just plain good. The bacon was not too fatty and it added the perfect smokiness to the turkey. The crunch of the bread mixed with the meat and veggies was a pure delight! This was my favorite sandwich of the day.   Montagu: Turkey, Roast beef, lettuce, tomato, house mustard. I liked this sandwich too. There wasn't an overwhelming amount of meat, and again it all kind of worked together.   Italian: This was also very good. Typically, italian sandwiches (i.e. grinders) are way too salty for me because of all the different types of meat (which all tend to be on the salty side) To my surprise, the warm sandwich really hit the spot for me without making me run for a glass of water to wash down all the sodium.   Ham Egg and Cheddar breakfast sandwich- I thought this breakfast sandwich was just ok. I definitely think that the other specialty sandwiches are better deal in price and in flavor. It was kinda bland, and I needed my special hot sauce to give it a zing. ($3.99)  Earl of Sandwich was so good, that I went there TWICE in one visit (especially with all the good places vegas has to offer). It's definitely a good alternative if you're trying to stay on budget, without sacrificing flavor.   Highly recommended!",

Earl's might seem overwhelming when you approach them and see the long lines of people and realize it's open seating... but as you'll soon be able to notice, the lines go by really quick and people are constantly leaving so a table won't be hard to get!  My favorite here has always been the Caribbean Jerk chicken... spicy with bell peppers! Mmmm delicious!!    The club is always a good choice and recently, due to the holiday, they have the holiday sandwich which consists of turkey, stuffing and cranberries! It's actually better than I had expected!    I also always enjoy their coleslaw and their potato salad!",

Your stomach is grumbling and you decide that it might be best to fill it with something before everything you consumed earlier that night comes up in a very unpleasant way.  If you're ever in such a situation, Earl of Sandwich is definitely the perfect remedy for you. Though there's usually a line, it goes pretty quickly, and especially late at night there are always interesting people to talk to in line.  I usually go for the full motagu, which has turkey, roast beef, and some sort of mustard in it. However, I've tried the Tuna melt and the jerk chicken, and both are pretty good.  The sandwich is decently sized for around $6, so I usually split the sandwich with a friend or save it for drunchies later.  Even when I'm not staying at planet hollywood, I always make an effort to try to come to Earl's for at least one meal, and I'll definitely be back in the future.",

I sat down, opened my hot sandwich, and as soon as I took a bite out of my Earl Club sandwich, I was in love.  The bread was freshly baked to order and it was so good.  The sandwich sauce they use; delish!  My boyfriend had the meatball sub and he was just as in love as I was with this place.  We are going to eat here again today before we leave the PH.  This shop will definitely make us keep coming back for more.    It's the perfect size too!  I think that the freshly baked bread they use is what definitely makes this sandwich stick out.  I love bread though, so I might be a little bias.  I can't wait to try more of their sandwiches!    I also had the macaroni salad, pasta salad, and their chocolate chip cookies.  They taste like they should; nothing to rave about.   But the sandwiches...YUM!  I think I can eat one everyday!  I'm very glad I got to finally try Earl of Sandwich.  Go now!  You will NOT be disappointed!  Not even by the price!",

Sooooo good!!! This place definitely got the goods. They are doing something right. Lines were long but the workers are so quick in taking your orders it didn't take too long for them to make our sandwiches. You order your sandwich at one end. Get your sides if you like variety of chips, coleslaw, potato salad, macaroni salad, and variety of desserts. And your choice of bottled or fountain drinks and then at the end you pay. They give you one of those vibrating buzzer things to let you know when order was ready. We never waited more than 5 minutes. Their dining area was always packed. Love this place. I an a huge fan Earl!!! Not so much of the cannon ball sandwich but the tuna melt best tuna melting I had ever eaten by far. I will be back again!",

Just get a cheap sandwich ($5 to $7) or three, go to your room (if you still have one), and grub down while tears of joy (delicious sandwich) and depression (where's my money?!?!) roll down your face.   Lines are long, most of the time, so try not to go crazy with all of the Vegas sounds destroying your senses.",

Also, the sandwiches are cut in half, so pretty easy to share and split, if need be.  The lemonade icee tho was ridiculous. It tasted like a lemon warhead and was crazy sour. I almost was unable to handle it given how god damn sour that drink was.  The line moves quick, and don't worry about getting a table, because people are always finishing up. But definitely on my list of places to go next time I'm in town.",

    "text": "Might just be my new favorite late night spot in Vegas.  Located inside Planet Hollywood, Earl of Sandwich will definitely surprise you.  There's fairly big selection of sandwiches so it's not hard to find something for everybody.  We went for the Hawaiian BBQ sandwich and the Caprese.  The Hawaiian BBQ is my favorite out of the two.  Ham, pineapple, cheese, and BBQ sauce just go so well together.  Think of a Hawaiian pizza, transplanted between two awesome artisan bread.  OMG the bread is just awesome.  Crunchy on the outside and soft on the inside.  It is just toasted perfectly.    As for the Caprese, it's your classic mozzarella, tomato, and basil with a balsamic vinaigrette.  I wish there was more basil cause I think we only saw two leaves of basil.  Two!  Sorta ridiculous for a whole sandwich but the thick sliced mozza was a nice touch.  There's also some pastries and cookies available.  I went for the chocolate chip cookie.  At $1.99, it's pretty big, it's soft, and it satisfied my sweet tooth.  There's also chips by Earl of Sandwich available to go along with your sandwich.  Salads, wraps, and sides are also available but really, the main stars are the sandwiches.  The sandwiches are a bargain too, considering it is on the strip, at $5.99.  It is loud though since it's right next to the casino floor but good food at a good value is hard to beat!  Of course, it's not just for late night, as sandwiches are good anytime.  They even have breakfast items but I can never wake up early enough for breakfast :P",

After trading my 1/2 sandwich with a buddy, I got to try the Italian, which I ordered and the Original which I traded for. The Italian was a bit saltier and was the better of the two sandwiches but they're nothing to write home about. Eh.   After reading the reviews and standing in line for about 25-30 minutes, I was expecting some spectacular, mind boggling, better than sex kind of a sandwich but sorely, it didn't live up to the hype.  Drop by if nothing is open and you want some decent food at cheap prices. Other than that, I wouldn't recommend waiting 20 minutes, let alone going out of your way to eat here.",

But no where does it say \"Our sandwiches are all lathered with butter\".  Nothing against toasted bread with butter one it- I would just prefer not to have the taste of my sandwich overcome with grease.  I got the Caprese Sandwich- tomato, mozzarella, basil, and balsamic vinegar, oh, and a crap ton of butter. The flavors were overwhelmed with the butter, and really took away the great taste. Well, what should have been a great taste really. The tomatoes seem alright, but the basil was lacking and the cheese just didn't have the fresh mozzarella taste to it. My boyfriend had been here before and had the same problem; greasy sandwich, not so tasty ingredients, but we came back to try it anyways. Same thing really. I guess I may try one more time, if I am just passing by and really hungry, and get a sandwich WITHOUT butter, if that is possible.",

I probably spent less than 5 minutes in line.   Ordered the Earl Club. I didn't quite like the cheese but I liked everything else. And even though it's not a foot long, it's still very filling and they don't skimp you on the meat.  Definitely a Vegas must-try!  Or Dear Earl of Sandwich, come to CA already!",

When it came out, I was sad that it looked so small but I liked the presentation of how it was wrapped in gold paper. I killed the sandwich in 5 minutes...I was that hungry. I definitely really liked the thousand island sauce with it. After that, I just knocked out. But I definitely think that it's really good. At first I didn't like that it was so small but then I realized that I never finish a full sandwich anyway so it was a good amount that didn't make me feel too bloated but satisfied me just enough. The bread was soft and there was good flavors. I do wish that they had a bigger selection on the menu though but I think I would come back if I needed that morning food kick. Oh and the food came out much faster than I expected which was nice because I just wanted to go back to the hotel to sleep.",

During an afternoon of belligerent drinking or after a night of partying, grabbing a sandwich from here isn't a bad choice if you don't feel like having a $5 pizza.   All the sandwiches I've tried have been pretty consistent: not bad, but nothing special. The two I particularly enjoy are the Tuna and Holiday Turkey. I'm pretty picky about my tuna and this place rounds up a pretty decent melt.. chunky bites of tuna on their crispy Artisan bread, too good. The holiday turkey is probably one of my favorite sandwiches ever. I love all the ingredients that make up the sandwich: turkey, stuffing, gravy, and cranberry! Thanksgiving in a sandwich. Yummm!   Earl's also offer plenty of other snacks: wraps, soups, salads, chips, drinks, etc.. but all you really need is a sandwich and a complimentary cocktail from the casino, and you're all good!  This location is always busy, usually backed up with a line. I think it's definitely worth it though if you're hungry and looking for a cheap choice.",

I've tried their breakfast sandwiches, special sandwiches, and their salads, all are very good. But if you go here, get a sandwich at least- well worth your money.  My favorite is the Earl Club with turkey and bacon but I also loved the bacon and egg breakfast sandwich too. They give plenty of bacon here :)  Open 24 hrs. What more do you want?",

The sandwiches I ordered were the spicy jerk and the full montagu.   Just a note, if they just changed the name of the sandwiches to numbers, it would speed up their operations by maybe 5 seconds per person. Multiply that by the abundance of people that flock to this join, it would make them more efficient.  Oh, I do have to say though, the wait for the sandwiches were no more than 7 minutes being crowded. So kudos to that.   Upon tasting, I didn't taste anything different maybe except for the bread. I do love how soft and chewy it is, even though it was baked. Baked...hmm. Isn't Quizno's baked too? I think this joint is almost like a glamorized Quiznos. Tho good, it just tasted gimmicky with the baked option.   I did order a kids turkey sandwich and that sandwich was better than the other two I ordered. So if you just want to try without spending the extra dough, get a kids sandwich here.",

When we asked where our order was, no one knew. We insisted to get a refund since it shouldn't take close to half an hour for a single sandwich.

I shared the All-American with my friend and it was DELICIOUS! We were hoping they had their Thanksgiving sandwich, but it wasn't being offered, so we opted for the next best...All-American. The turkey was moist and flavorful, and the cranberry sauce complimented the sandwich perfectly. Surprisingly, cheddar cheese and cranberry sauce go well together. We were a little iffy about that before we chowed down into our sandwich. The price is decent for what you get. The bread is airy and well toasted. Nice crunch on the outside, but fluffy in the inside.   Writing about it makes me crave it even more. This just means I need to make another trip to Vegas :)  Only complaint I have is the freshness of their desserts. My friend bought the brownie bites, but they were really dry and stale tasting.",

Wraps- They're fresh but nothing as tasty as the sandwiches.  Salads- Small in size, but tasty. Try the Cobb.  Baked Goods- ahhhh.... The cookies are moist and rich.  Although I'm usually a huge fan of chocolate chip cookies, the sugar cookie was my favorite in this case.    Don't let the long line discourage you!

Yes, True!  I love love their BLT.  The Caribbean Jerk Chicken Sandwich and Tuna Melt are also very popular and delicious.  It's their warm, soft bread that really steps their sandwiches a notch above most others. Their salads are not so good so unless you're seriously allergic to bread or something, try a sandwich.

Tip #2:  Cheap (~8 dollars for a sandwich).   Tip #3:  The line can get pretty long at times, but it goes by quickly.  Lots of open seating as well.

Honestly, the quality is just as good as the other Earl of Sandwich on the strip but I'm guessing this has so many more reviews and ratings because it was the original (I think?). After the club crawl, this was one of the establishments that was open and ready to take orders! So the accessibility is great especially when you have the munchies in Vegas! I've gotten their warm sandwiches before and they are really good!  Cons: I would probably stay away from the Thai wrap as it is a bit too sour (vinegar?) for me so it wasn't that tasty. I should have stuck with their Earl of SANDWICHES next time.  Overall: Great spot to get some food at any time of the hour! Plus you don't have to tip making this meal on a budget in Vegas!",

However, their bread, which is toasted and buttered is very tasty.  This is a good place for a quick bite in Planet Hollywood, but there are a lot of other food options in Vegas.

It took me about a year to use them because I was not convinced I would like them a second time.I will say I was wrong, my sandwich choice this time was the roast beef cheddar and horseradish was mighty tasty the meat was tender the bun was perfectly tossed just the right amount of horseradish(you know too much can be over powering). the Mac and cheese with bacon was good just the right amount of creamy! The bacon pieces were a bit big so half way through the Mac n cheese all the bacon was gone next time I am going to ask them to chop it up a bit more for me, for me it's a bit over priced. My husband ordered the Italian sandwich and to me it's the best sandwich they have he wasn't crazy about the pasta salad said it was a bit bland. I have been there 3 times after my first review the thing I like about Earl is their customer service and consistency. I won't say this is my favorite sandwich place but when we are playing poker at planet Hollywood they are right next to the room which makes them a great choice location wise and they are open 24 hours.",

I couldn't get enough. Once i finished my half of the roast beef. We all traded to get a different taste.  The tuna melt was nice and hot. That familiar tuna taste was delicious. It didn't even taste heavy like so it was just perfect. I think it is the bread that makes the sandwich. It just so tasty and just enough crunch (not so hard that it scratches the roof of my mouth). All together with the tuna and cheese is amazing. Mouth drooling right now. So good. The Carribean Jerk chicken was delicious as well. Chicken was plenty, moist, and not tough to eat. The peppers: red and yellow made the sandwich giving that jerk taste. Fantastic. The roast beef was alright. I wasn't such a fan of it. It was alright. I think it needed more flavor or something. It didn't leave an impression on me compared to the tuna melt and the carribean jerk.   I love that Earl of Sandwich is affordable and ummm open 24 hours. I wish we could have stopped by before we left. Sad, we didn't But it is ok. Next time. Maybe it'll be a late night sandwich every night we are there. I'm so looking foreword to it.   -This is a must GO!!  *Drool*",

Couldn't finish a small one (maybe I wasn't hungry enough. But still don't think having a bowl of salty soup in the Vegas summer is a good idea). The bread of the sandwich is awesome, crispy, soft, and fresh.   Also, the price here is very affordable, which probably is the reason why it got such a high rate on yelp.  Would recommend it as a decent fast meal.",

Definitely worth a try considering husband wanted to order more and colleague (who happened to also be in vegas) texted me the next morning to make sure I had some before leaving and told me he ate there and then brought about $100 worth back for his family.

The sandwich came out hot - the manger explained that the bread had to be baked and he offered to remake the sandwich, bake the bread, then add the ingredients. Rather than wait, I went ahead with the tuna melt and I was pleasantly surprised.  The bread was excellent, and the tuna and cheese inside was very good.  This is also one of the less expensive meals I have had in Vegas - all in all a good deal and highly recommended.",

I thought it was delicious, but I wasn't 100% sure if it really was delicious or could it have been because I was super hungry and a little bit drunk?  However, I recently made another trip to Earl Of Sandwich before leaving Las Vegas, and this time I was sober. And let me say, the all american REALLY is DELICIOUS!! The cranberries in the sandwich is what made me love the sandwich so much more.  It's not something I expected to be good in a sandwich, but it is what makes the sandwich so amazing! My mouth is watering just writing about it.  My boyfriend ordered the Earl's Club and it was really good too, but after having my mouth watering, cranberry filled all american, the Earl's club couldn't compare.  All in all, if your're in the area, you definitely need to try this place.  Amazing food for an unbeatable price in an awesome location.  It cannot be beat.",

I can't deny bacon in anything, so the club sandwich was definitely a win. The carribean jerk sandwich had an amazing spread to it, packed a powerful kick with some tender loving. I've named the carribean jerk sandwich my favorite of all time. The tomato soup is topped with freshly baked croutons and is the right amount of creamy. I'd say the soup itself is filling for a light lunch.   Cheap, fresh, delicious.",

As for the pricing, you can't beat this as they are  located at the center of the strip. Will try other sandwiches when I have chance to come back to Planet Hollywood :))",

Even the appearence of a fast food sandwich shop was very impressive, nothing spliied out while taking it back to my hotel. Great customer service and fast service. The sandwiches are neatly wrapped.

We got tired of buffets that closed before 10pm, and it didn't make sense for a city that never sleeps to have fast food open only at night. The hot sandwiches were amazing, we ordered their club sandwich and original, with macaroni salad. After driving around looking for decent food that wasn't overpriced, we were really happy. We ate for under $20. I wish that we had heard of this place sooner instead of waste money on overpriced food that left us still hungry! We will definitely be returning!",

Earl of Sandwich has quite an operation as workers at their stations work furiously in their assembly and preparations.   Once I observed the line, I could not contemplate eating any sooner than 30 minutes as there were a good fifty people ahead of me. However, I was pleasantly surprised to be ordering in ten minutes and eating ten minutes after that. (There must have been 15 people prepping, an army of preppers in comparison to Subway   The Italian sub was thin on ingredients, not very exciting. Probably a poor choice by me, a NY Italian to order that item even though expectations were at a minimum. Chipolte Chicken Avacado was a nice twist, spicy, creamy with nice chunks of tender chicken breast. Throw in a banana for a buck and you have a fairly good, on the go eating experience. Go check out the Earl if your in the area, you won't disappoined.",

The sandwiches are about $7 each, so they're a little pricey given the size, but it's Vegas..  The line can get pretty long so come at off-hours if you don't like waiting! There's a good amount of seating, but it gets packed easily, so chances are you'll be hovering over tables, waiting for people to leave.  I don't think you can really go wrong with any of the sandwiches, but I do recommend eating them while they're still warm! The bread is soft and chewy, and the cheese (if there is any) is perfectly melted.  My preferences: * THE ORIGINAL 1762 [roast beef, cheddar, horseradish sauce] - the beef is SO tender. love the horseradish! * ITALIAN [salami, capicola, ham, mortadella, mozzarella, tomato, italian seasoning, italian dressing] - lots of meat! * HOLIDAY TURKEY [turkey, cornbread stuffing, turkey gravy, cranberry sauce, mayo] - tastes exactly like you'd expect * THE EARLS CLUB [turkey, bacon, swiss, lettuce, tomato, sandwich sauce] - classic/sile sandwich, but you can't go wrong with bacon * THE FULL MONTAGU [roast beef, turkey, swiss, cheddar, lettuce, tomato, mustard sauce] - also pretty much a classic sandwich  I've also tried the TOMATO SOUP. I'm not really a fan of the soggy croutons/bread in it, but the soup itself is pretty good.",

    "text": "Great sandwiches. Got me two because I liked the first one and wanted something to nibble on the airplane back.  The Original 1762 was my favorite. The roast beef just peels right off on every bite. And it came with the right amount of horseradish sauce. The bread wasn't greasy, there were no oil marks on my hands. Comes packaged that looks like a brick, so it's portable and you don't have to worry about sauces oozing out or anything. <a href=\"http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/DkYS3arLOhA8si5uUEmHOw?select=9ra0lc9u_tMiLh9A4l9efw\">yelp.com/biz_photos/DkYS...</a>  The same goes for my Earl's Club. Turkey, bacon, and swiss cheese in the same cohesive brick sandwich format. Again, bread was awesome. <a href=\"http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/DkYS3arLOhA8si5uUEmHOw?select=CRdDcUu4iZJn7E0Gpqsv8w\">yelp.com/biz_photos/DkYS...</a>  For a relatively cheap lunch/dinner out in Vegas, then this place will suit your needs. For under $7 a sandwich, it's good enough to get you going and you don't have to worry about breaking the bank.   It's open 24 hours a day, so if you have those late night cravings, then this place has the sandwiches right there. Be prepared for the long lines during rush hour.",

I add in extra avocado to make up for it. It can get crowded so be ready to wait in line and for your order to come out. Its worth the wait though. I think I'm going to try the Hawaiian BBQ with avocado next time. Don't forget to get creative ;) The tomato soup is nice and creamy if you aren't looking to grab a sandwich.   The vanilla creme brownie sandwiches are bomb, try it at least once. You're in Vegas...so don't feel bad that your diet's out the window. Just hit the gym hard like a bro when you get back home.

When you come here, be prepared to wait at least 15min during off hours, to at least an hour during busy hours (drunchie hours). I always get the Full Montagu bc I'm a big fan of roast beef and mustard. However, my friends get the chipotle chicken avocado as well.   This time around, we went for a late lunch at around 2pm on Saturday, and waited about 15 min to order. Got the Montagu and tried the mac and cheese for the first time. The mac was nice and cheesy, a very solid choice. (However Bacchanal has some of the dankest mac&cheese in Vegas).   There's not much else I can say about this place. You get consistent sandwiches for reasonable prices. All I have to add is that you should buy 2 sandwiches: 1 for your meal, and another to take back to your hotel room and eat later. That way, you can try another sandwich if you're like me and will always get the Montagu.  ps. Dijon mustard on the Montagu makes it even better if you're a hot mustard fan like me.",

I had the Montagu (thanks Yelpers for the advice) and the hubby had the turkey club. We both killed our sandwiches - the sauces really added flavor, but it wasn't too overwhelming, rich, or salty. It was just the perfect blend of savory and spices.  Dessert tip: you MUST get the brownie sandwich (to eat there - you'll have room, trust me!) AND the $1.99 brownie to go for later. SOOO good, chewy and decadent and well-made. It's still fresh even after a day (and after a 1 hour flight). You can really taste the high quality (Ghiradelli chocolate). I took some home with me to the Bay Area and was the envy of my friends. :)",

We enjoyed it then as much as we do now.  I have tried many sandwiches and have loved them all just as much as the other, so I can't suggest just one. I have not tried the meatball or tuna, but their lunchmeat is good, cheese is great, and produce are the perfect accessories. Their bacon is cooked perfectly and they give generous amounts if ordered on a sandwich. The star for us in the toasted roll. The warmth of the sandwich is enough to melt the cheese a bit, but not to make the produce soggy- stays cold.   Wish there were some Earl of Sandwiches in Orange County....since there is already one at Downtown Disney at Disneyworld, why not make one at Downtown Disney at Disneyland? So many other eateries are mirrored at both resorts, so no one would complain.....we'd be happy!",

I stayed at the Monte Carlo and I was walking around with the group I was with. They wanted to do some shopping in Planet Hollywood and I was hungry, but didn't want to eat anything that I have back at home. I stumbled across this place and saw the different types of sandwiches they had. When I got up to the cashier, I asked him how big the sandwich was b/c 5.99 is a pretty good price for a sandwich. For someone that eats a lot, their 6 inch subs hit the spot. I got a tuna melt and have been hooked ever since. I saw a sign that they were 24 hours, so what did I do when I was hungry after a late night clubbing adventure? I made a Earl of Sandwich run...lol. I've only tried their Tuna Melt and can't say enough about the sandwich. Their oatmeal raisin cookies were pretty awesome too. I'm really upset that the nearest location to me is in Orlando, FL. They're in really random locations and I wish they built one here in Charlotte, NC. They would do well here and run Jersey Mikes/Quiznos/Jimmy Johns out of business.   Earl of Sandwich for the win!!!!!!!!!",

If you were to have 100 Jamaicans taste this sandwich and ask them what flavor it is, I'm sure 99 out of 100 times, the answer wouldn't be Jerk Chicken. The sandwich had some run of the mill pre-packed, pre-cooked, sandwich-chain chicken breast with runny mayo sauce that can be quickly squirted from a squeeze bottle.

So we wanted something cheap.  iPhone + Yelp + one $ sign + Planet Hollywood = Earl of Sandwich  It was the highest rated one dollar sign restaurant in the area, and it definitely deserves it.  I had \"the Original,\" which is simply a roast beef sandwich.  However, their execution is perfect.  The fresh baked bread is soft and delicious.  The cheese and horseradish sauce perfectly accompany the juicy roast beef.  Dip a little mustard or steak sauce if you like, and BAM... perfection.  DAMN, I could eat another one of those right now!",

    "text": "We kept bumming around in our hotel room in Encore and couldn't decide where to eat; my gf wanted to go to Serendipity 3 but I wasn't too amused by the 3 star yelp rating.  So we decided to walk down to Planet Hollywood at 10:30pm toward Earl's which was open 24 hours but was like 7 hotels down (Encore-Wynn-Venetian-A bunch of ones I forgot/Flamingo/Imperial Palace) and finally got there, and we were like \"this BETTER be good.\"   The sandwiches were on the smaller side, but a decent amount, and we tried the Pot roast and the turkey.  They were toasted and fresh, and the turkey had fresh ingredients and a crisp flavor with tomato/lettuce/cheese and some tangy sauce.  I personally really liked the pot roast, which was very juicy and tender, while the juices did not sog up the crisp and chewy bread.  We discussed that it just takes some fresh ingredients, good bread, and good meat to make a good sandwich; Earl of Sandwich definitely got it right.     Being that this place is not all that pricey (if you were really hungry you could order 2 x $5.99 sandwiches for $12 total, which is cheap compared to some other places in Vegas).  The \"Loaded Potato\" soup is really good too, reminded us of creamy clam chowder with potatoes instead of clams.",

We arrived around lunch time, but it moved fairly quickly.  Having the line actually gave us time to take a look at the menu.  One of us has been here countless times, but it was my first time.  He decided to go for the Full Montagu, and I had the Tuna Melt.  We found a seat and waited for the buzzer. The food came out pretty fast and I really enjoy how the sandwiches are wrapped. We decided to split the sandwiches and have a half of each.   The Tuna, I must say was really delicious but maybe on the dry side.  It had a lot of tuna inside the sandwich and the melted cheese is really amazing.  However, next time I think I would ask them to include some lettuce and tomatoes.  It did not taste bad with the ketchup, I prefer it over the mustard.  Now the Full Montagu never seems to disappoint.  It is not too salty and has just enough flavor.  It is great with the Dijon mustard!   You must try Earl's when you are in Vegas!!",

You can tell how popular it is by the long, long lines that this place has. You can see the employees make your sandwiches are They give you a buzzer to let you know when your order is ready to be picked up at the counter.   I've tried the Earl's Club, Chicken Chipotle Avocado, and the Chicken Bacon Avocado Wrap. My favorite is the Earl's Club (it's displayed on the huge board above the area where you place your order). They have salads, wraps, soups, side items (pasta salad, potato salad, chips, etc), and hot and cold sandwiches. I'd say stick with the hot sandwiches because you won't be able to get sandwiches like these. They wrapped them up in a paper foil that keeps it hot and warm for a long time. The sandwiches are so big that I always have to save the other half for later.   What's another great perk about this place? There's FREE WIFI!  I can't wait to come back to Las Vegas. I will definitely frequent it whenever I'm in town.",

It was a look that I would describe as \"contemptuous\" or \"irritated\" as in \"Hi assh#le, Would you get on with your order? I don't like you, and I find you unattractive.\" I mean, come on. How hard is it to take a sandwich order? The people at Subway have to make 'em, too! This guy couldn't have handled that.  -They have changed the menu. Unfortunately, some of our favorites have been removed. Disappointing.  -The sandwiches were just OK. Nothing special. The bread is good, but the rest of the sandwich was just average. I would consider it dry, bland, and just thrown together. My companion and I both felt the same way, though we ordered different sandwiches.

I appreciate that there's an affordable option on the Strip, but most casinos have a food court or casual eatery on site somewhere, so price really isn't enough to nudge this into the extra-stars category. This is basically a slightly-nicer Quizno's.  Earl of Sandwich is a chain that offers (what else?) sandwiches: warm or cold, with side options like chips and cookies, and the occasional soup or salad. While some rave about their bread, I guess I've gone on the wrong days because it didn't blow my mind.  The original is tasty, though I prefer a very light touch with my horseradish. It's refreshing to see a caprese on a fast-food menu, but the bread texture/density doesn't complement the delicate components of this particular sandwich.  But the fact that this place is rated one of the top five places to dine in Vegas based on star score and number of reviews is downright insulting to the hundreds of phenomenal restaurants we have, even including ones that are not celebrity-chef-owned or expensive.",

Sandwich prices cost as much as a Venti frap in Las Vegas' price-inflated market - so about 7 bucks. An excellent deal in a part of a town where nothing costs $7.  Sandwiches are excellent but rather small so it functions better for those fill-up meals. Dollar/value/location is a solid 5.",

There are customers 24/7 (as it's open 24 hours), and lunch time can get pretty hectic. ~1pm on a saturday I waited in line around 15 minutes. The staff are very efficient though, and my sandwiches came out in a jiffy. They seem to have some sort of a very ordered assembly line going on since a rampage of a hungry crowd is anticipated during this time of day. Every single table was occupied, but it's likely you'd snag a table if you keep an eye out. Everything's fast paced here, even the diners are quick with eating and then they carry on.  Each sandwich I ordered were $6.49. In the order from worst to best: 1) Earl's Club: bacon, turkey, lettuce, tomato. You ordinary club sandwich. I wasn't very impressed. 2) Chipotle Chicken and Avocado: I appreciated their generosity with the avocado. The sandwich itself reminded me of Panera's chipotle chicken panini. It was okay. 3) The Full Montagu: roast beef, turkey, and cheese with sauce. The meat was moist and warm. I savored every bite! 4) Tuna melt: tuna and swiss cheese. So simple yet so genius. Creamy and flavorful. It was a party in my mouth.  I wasn't blown away like I expected myself to be, but it's definitely a must try!",

Among the contenders are the likes of Capriotti's, Mendocino Farms, Which Wich? and many more. Among this iconic list of sandwich makers, there are droves of fans and haters alike. But make no mistake, The Earl of Sandwich makes some of the most addictively good sandwiches i've enjoyed in a very long time! Tack on the competitive prices and it makes it even better! So it's safe to say i'm a fan when it comes to the Earl's cheap & tasty eats!  The Original with Roast Beef -  The bread was excellent! As soon as I grabbed the warm bag in my hand, I knew I was in for a toasty treat! The bread was perfectly crisp on the outside yet warm and fluffy on the inside. Not thick, bread-y, dry & spongy like most other places. The roast beef was piled high and it was juicy and full of mouthwatering flavor!  Jerk Chicken Sandwich Filled with generous portions of chunk grilled chicken breast (not sandwich meat), red peppers and of course a good helping of zippy banana peppers, this zesty lil number was quite flavorful and surprisingly juicy (considering it was chicken breast!) but my favorite has to be the original for overall mmmmmm mmmm mm factor!  Dessert Brownie Cream Sandwich Imagine two chocalatey rich brownies sandwiching a decadent layer of sweet vanilla frosting...yup it's insanely rich and sweet! I advise you to purchase a glass of milk with this decadent number cuz you'll definitely need it!  Service was nifty & quick and they got us in and out in no time flat! Don't forget that all toppings are free with the exclusion of avocado, so pile it high if you so desire! And did I mention the prices? Only 6$ for a delicious hot sammie! That's a steal for a great sandwich on the strip I might add!  With that said, it's a no brainer...if you're out after the club looking for some awesome late nite eats or just strolling the strip, give EoS a try, you won't be disappointed!  Happy Eats!",

The ham and cheddar omelette came with home fries AND half a bagel for $5.99! That's crazy good to me. And then a ham and swiss breakfast sandwich was I believe $3.99. The kitchen and drinks area was a little gross, but nothing I couldn't stomach (get it, heh heh heh). I skipped the mustard and sour cream on that sandwich and got a packet of jelly and made my own non-fried monte cristo. Score.   Plenty of tables, line relatively short even if food took a while once you got your buzzer. Holding on to my last two stars for the long-ish wait for the food itself, the griminess, and the lack of options for breakfast.    Keep this in your arsenal for planning a Vegas trip when you don't want to drop a lot of dough for a little food first thing.",

While I agree that it was delicious and really satisfied our munchies, I'm not sure it's 5-star worthy (which I reserve for the best of the best), so I'll give it a 4.  We tried: - The Italian sandwich: bread was nice and toasted, cheese was gooey and melted, and dressing was flavorful. Could have used a bit more meat to balance the meat-to-bread ratio. Overall really yummy but not significantly better than most Italian sandwiches.  - Mac-and-cheese: okay, this was REALLY good. Great crunch on top, very warm, and not overly cheesy. Couldn't stop eating my friend's lol. - Thanksgiving sandwich: my friend really enjoyed this (I tried a bit). The stuffing and the cranberry sauce really did make it taste like Thanksgiving in a sandwich.   Service was fast (the lines moved quickly), and everything was decently cheap (~$7) considering that it's Vegas. Not sure everything would taste as good in the middle of the day, but definitely a great spot for late night munchies!",

Thus, every time I am in Vegas I make at least one stop here.    The sandwich are ridiculously affordable being that it is located on the strip.  Sandwiches are around $6 to $7 and is made with perfectly toasted ciabatta bread.  Honestly, the bread makes the sandwich; so delicious.  My favorite is the earl's club:  a traditional turkey club made with swiss cheese, lettuce, tomato & their signature sandwich sauce.  The chipotle chicken avocado is also good as well.  Check out is very efficient.  You first place an order for the sandwich then move down the line to choose your drinks, chips or sides. At the end you receive a buzzer to let you know when your sandwich is made.  Process is quick.    Definitely, come here if your running low on cash or want more for your money!!",

Some things that would've made it better, was if they used romain lettuce and not mixed greens, parmesean cheese and croutons (the last two were missing from my wrap). These missing ingredients didn't take away from the sandwich, but would've elevated their star rating! LOL!  If in the area again while in Vegas I might stop by.

My dining companion decided to get The Earl's Club and I'd get The Full Montagu and we could try the other person's sandwich.  I thought The Full Montagu was just okay.  It could be because I'm not much of a roast beef person (why I got it, I don't know lol) and it was too much meat.  It was definitely very filling.  I had a bite or two of The Earl's Club and liked it better than my sandwich.    Bottom line: These aren't the best sandwiches I've ever had, but what I tasted of The Earl's Club was good enough to make me want to come back and order that next time.  I probably would have gotten it on this visit had I known that the turkey and bacon combination works for this sandwich.  (I like turkey sandwiches and bacon in general but have never had the two together.)  Also, don't be put off by the long line or how full the restaurant may look.  The line goes pretty fast, the food comes out quickly, and there's a good turnover of tables.",

Located in Planet Hollywood is Earl's home of arguably some of the best and cheapest Sandwiches, each one costs about $7. Our group ordered the:   Original- 5/5= imagine a french dip sandwich with horse radish sauce, basically an Arby sandwich on steroids  Montagu- 4/5= tastes like an ordinary BLT to me  Caribbean Jerk- 5/5= Peppered chicken with a kick, love it!  Hawaiian- 3/5= Tastes like a Hawaiian pizza, unfortunately, I'm not a fan of sweet food so no tangy bbq for me  Tuna melt- 4/5=  Tastes pretty ordinary to me, however, it is still pretty good, almost tastes more like albacore then tuna.  Dear King of Sandwich whoever you are, move over because Earl of Sandwich is ready to behead you and claim himself the king of all Sandwiches.   Overall, shout out to Eva I for picking this one out.

Whatever crack they use in these sandwiches are sure to please.

You stand in line, make a choice from the dozen or so sandwiches and then pay at the other end of the counter.  It comes out toasty and warm, and large enough to quell hunger pangs, but the meat - which mostly why you choose that particular sandwich - can be dry and chewy.

    "text": "Earls and Fat Tuesdays are my perfect Vegas meal! You can't go wrong cause everything about this place is sooo right.   Perfect for any meal of the day! Whenever I go to Vegas I think I honestly go on an Earls diet. If I'm staying in PH this is the ONLY thing I get. Usually I'm too drunk or hungover for food but for the taste of Earls, I'll eat it even if I yack it out.. HEH, kind of gross huh? But it's that good.  I looove the Full Montagu, perfect for all you meat lovers out there! This sandwich is packed to the brim with meat and the bread is always warm and just the right texture. I highly recommend eating it with the hp steak sauce, BOMB.COM!  Another favorite is their new chicken chipotle sandwich, omggzz, heaven in my mouth. It's super saucey and flavorful. Comes with avocado so it has that rich creamy taste. MM MM GOOD, I think it can be considered as my new crack *__*  I know a lot of my friends really dig the Italian, but I've never tried it. I just can't seem to part from my Montagu.. so next time I'm in Sin City, I guess I'll indulge in gluttony and just get both. Try something new, without sacrificing my love. HEHE Win-Win!",

Located just outside of Planet Hollywood's Miracle Mile shops, this place can get busy! All sandwiches are priced around $7-9 I believe, so it's pretty inexpensive. Open 24/7, be smart about when you come here. The line moves quickly though, so don't let the long line deter you. Order first... then move down the assembly line counter and pay at the end. Your buzzer will go off when your sandwich has been made :)   I love the chipotle avocado chicken sandwich ^_^ I've always tried the cranberry turkey one, which was good as well! Yum :) I'll also mention there's an Earls in Downtown Disney in Anaheim too- in case you're really really craving it.",

There is always a line whenever you go there but that place is always open! While you wait, you can also hit up those slot machines near Earl's too.   Highly recommended for your sandwich cravings!",

I know there is usually a line, just like the Downtown Disney spot, but we were lucky.  Lots of seating to accomondate different sizes of groups from booths to large tables.  The Chipoltle chicken with avacado is amazingly yummy. Chicken, cheddar cheese, bacon,  lettuce, avacado snuggled inside a 6 inch toasted white of wheat roll smeared with a tastey chipoltle sauce.  The Italian was a hit with the hubsters. Asked for some extra mayo and mustard packs to squeeze all over the bread. Paired it with a side of Mac and Cheese. Perfect meal.  Lets talk size. These sammies are SMALL. You will be hungry after you inhale one into your tummy. Get a side and some chips to go with it, or even a salad. You won't regret it. You will regret just eating a sandwich because you will bd starving.  Self serve Pepsi products, Earl Grey iced tea, lemonade, and hot tea available. Along with Peets coffee. I slurrped 2 glasses if Unsweetened tea. Then I iced my coffee. It was kind of tricky, but I made it work.   It is a win win here. My entire party enjoyed their meals. Price was reasonable. Only complaint was the size.  When in Vegas looking for a quick bite.  Im a fan!!  #835",

It's not so much a culinary experience as a tactical one.  No matter what I order, I always come back to The Full Montagu ($7), usually by stealing it from my boyfriend. It's got a great combination of meats in it, and enough veggies to eke it into \"healthy\" territory. Kind of.   Salads are great, also the chili. We've always been able to find seating easily, and I appreciate the buzzer system. Time not sitting down is painful time when you're three sheets.   Thanks to the location of the Miracle Mile and our poor foresight into when we'll need to eat, there's no doubt that we'll be here again. :-)",

I was wrong, I thought it was one of the tastiest sandwich spots I have ever tried.  Once I found Earl of Sandwich inside Planet Hollywood, I had to get me some. Ordered my two favorite sandwiches there. The Tuna Melt and the Hawaiian BBQ sandwiches.   The Tuna Melt (Albacore tuna salad, Swiss & mayonnaise) was oh so good. They pack a lot of tuna in the sandwich. This is the one sandwich where I don't need extra mayo because they put the right amount in there.   The Hawaiian BBQ (Grilled chicken, ham, Swiss, pineapple & BBQ sauce) is a sweet, tangy, and tasty sandwich. I like it when BBQ sauce meets pineapple. It is one awesome combination.   Definitely one of those snack on type of places or for late night munchies. A good substitute if you don't want to pay for an expensive dine in meals in Las Vegas. Just need to the manage the long line.",

I have to admit, I was not thrilled about having to eat a sandwich when there are so many other great places to eat in Vegas, but surprisingly, I actually really enjoyed my hot, toasted sandwich!  I had the Full Montagu minus the swiss cheese and mustard sauce on the side.  The bread was soft and light on the inside and had a nice crispy crust on the outside.  I liked that it wasn't too thick to fit in my mouth and that the roast beef was fresh.  My husband ordered the veggie melt and it was also quite delicious, though I like Gordon Ramsey's BurGR Earth Burger better than Earl's veggie.    There's always a long line here but it moves fast.  This is a quick, cheap and somewhat healthy option in Vegas if you're tired of all the rich, fried and copious amounts of food you've been indulging in at the buffets.  Planet Hollywood.  Check it out.",

What we got was decent enough for the price, but the buck stopped there. Unseasoned chicken strips, chewy bacon, and mushy avocado (guacamole basically) were overshadowed in a glut of off-putting Balsamic dressing. My lady's Breakfast sandwich was layered in dry scrambled eggs, dry plastic cheese, that same dry chewy bacon, and a dry English muffin. HARD PASS! The Earl of Sandwich is a last resort for the weak and weary late night Strip hedonists.... like us  lol.",

My top 3 favorite sandwiches with your choice of white or wheat Artisan bread are the following:  1. Original (roast beef, cheddar, horseradish) - The horseradish and beef goes together like hot dog and ketchup. It's PERFECTION! But if you don't like horseradish get the Full Montagu. 2. Full Montagu (roast beef, swiss, cheddar, lettuce, tomato) - Original with veggies minus the horseradish. 3. Earl's Club (turkey, bacon, swiss, lettuce, tomato) - Classic sandwich! Can't go wrong with this one.  I want to try the Pastrami Reuben, Chipotle Chicken Avocado, and their soups next time.  All their hot sandwiches are just $6.99. Also it's a nice change of pace from the constant Vegas buffets you go to if you're like me! :D",

My bf also ordered a tomato bisque soup and omg it was sooo good ! I love tomato bisque soups and this one definitely hit THE SPOT! I didn't even know they had that there. Otherwise I would've ordered one for myself as well! Great sandos, great prices. What more can u ask for ?",

Get yourself up and walk yourself to the Earl of Sandwich. I went to the one in Miracle Mile and I was NOT disappointed! The only other one I've been to is in Downtown Disney, and I love that place. My all time favorite sandwich (and I LOVE sandwiches, so that's saying something!) is their Turkey Holiday sandwich. I honestly wish my family would serve this at Thanksgiving. It's a hot sandwich with turkey, cornbread stuffing, gravy, cranberry relish, and mayonnaise. It is the best thing ever. PLUS, it's less than $8 and you will be full! They have a caprisi sandwich that's delicious as well. Honestly, you probably can't go wrong here. If you're looking for a delicious, inexpensive place to eat, this is exactly what you're looking for.",

I normally order the All-American or the Hawaiian barbecue they are dynamite sandwiches and a yummy in my tummy. They also have really good tomato soup and potato salad.

I've been to Vegas numerous times so not sure if Earl of Sandwich is new to the Las Vegas area.  Anyway, I remember why we still talk about this place, the sandwiches!! It was so hard to choose from, but I picked the roast beef, cheddar and horseradish one (forgot the name). I'm not a big fan of sandwiches because they can get messy. However, Earl is the exception. Once you unwrap the pretty gold foil, it's just utter goodness from there. The bread is perfectly toasted and its not messy to eat. In fact, the sandwiches stay in place during the entire time of consumption. Haha. If you are in Vegas and looking for a cheap spot, try this place, you won't regret it. It's located in Planet Hollywood but can enter from the Miracle Mile shops perfect for people watching. :)",

Mind you, there's quite a few options and all of them sounded really good. I'd say take a look at the menu while you're in line or before you step in.   I opted for the Thai Chicken Wrap cause sandwiches weren't calling my name. It was a decent sized wrap and it was wrap well - in the fact that things were layered in the way where you could take a bite and get a bit of each ingredient rather than a bite with all salad then protein then sauce.   All in all, this is a solid choice when in Vegas and you're trying to cut back on spending but still be full.",

Thank goodness the time I came to see you, there was no line because waiting in line for a sandwich, that shit cray.  But I'm glad my friends enjoyed your company.   For me, it was kinda like a going on a date.  Spending money and at the end of the date, I'm left wanting more.  Usually that's a good thing.  But after I left you, I saw some lobster roll place and kinda wish I spent my time and money there.  Which is usually not a good thing.  However, $5.99 a sandwich, I wouldn't be totally against coming by to see you again.    Don't call me, I'll call you.  Smooches,  Bong E  PS - I got to try The Original and The Club.  Maybe next time I'll try the Cannonball because I had a friend drop a meatball on the floor and thought about eating it.  Best hot sandwiches ever.  Question Mark.",

We came at 9am (LOL), and there was no line.   Like many people have mentioned before, the chicken avocado is VERY yum. Good grilled chicken, tasty bread, perfect size, big & fresh pieces of avocado and the right amount of sauce. The only small complaint was that the chipotle mayo tasted a bit too BBQey and less chipotle for me. But regardless, I'm pretty sure this and my 3 orange sodas cured me of my hangover.   The breakfast sandwich on the other hand was very blah. There was no taste, the bacon was overcooked (probably because it's the microwave kind), and the egg looked and tasted kind of like a sponge.  Sidenote: eating two of these, and then a burger and fries will definitely prepare you to look good in a clubbing dress later that night.",

This is another sandwich place, nothing special when you're sober, but I can't bring myself to give it 3-stars because of all the good memories I think I've had here and will probably continue to have provided I knock back a few first.

    "text": "Bizarre how Earl of Sandwich is located in the Planet Hollywood Hotel in Las Vegas, because this place is neither Hollywood glamour or Vegas sin; it gives more of the down-to-earth home feel.  The Full Montagu (roasted beef, turkey, swiss & cheddar cheese, lettuce, roma tomato & Earl's mustard) is near sandwich PERFECTION. If you need an extra kick, all the tables are stocked with grey poupon, which I'm a total sucker for. The bf had Cannonballs! (meatballs, marinara, mozzarella & parmesan cheese), which was a little salty, but still delish when hot. Then again, meatball sandwiches were never my thing.  If like me, you need your sandwich with a side of soup, this place offers a few soups to choose from. I had the broccoli and cheese soup, which comes with oyster crackers if you ask for them. It had nice bite-sized chunks of broccoli and wasn't too thick.  To finish it off, we tried the ice cream sandwich made with Ghirardelli chocolate. The top layer of brownie was good, but the ice cream wasn't creamy enough and the bottom layer was cake, which felt kind of cheap.  The best part about it is that the prices are totally reasonable and comparable to national sandwich chains. The sandwiches are all $5.95 and soups $2.95. And don't think you're going to get cheated with a shot glass of soup. It was an honest bowl-sized portion, and definitely more than what you'd get at the other chains. In addition, it offers a variety of fruit cups, parfaits, potato salads, cookies, chips and the like. You can have a full meal for under $10 in Vegas. Unheard of!",

The bread is toasted so perfectly, a little crunchy on the tip of the outside but soft on the inside. You can feel a LITTLE bit of greasyness but just a little, that's what makes it so good. Practically all the ones i tried was pretty good. But my favorite would still have to be the Turkey/Bacon Sandwich. Okay guys, I must cut this review short.

Well, that was effortless, thank you Universe.  My Caprese Salad & a fountain root beer cost less than $9. I so appreciated the very appropriate portion--just enough for one moderately hungry girl--as some portions in Vegas tend to err on the side of REE-diculous. The tomatoes & mozzarella were fresh, but the salad was kind of drowning in its vinaigrette. Overall, it was un-special & really kind of \"meh\" but I can't knock a place that serves $5.99 salads & sandwiches.

    "text": "We need this damn restaurant in Southern California! I hate the fact that I'll have to travel to Las Vegas or fly out to Texas or the East Coast to get a sandwich from the Earl.  The web site claims that the Sandwich family (the same family line of the Earl who invented the sandwich), a restaurateur, and a dude by the name of Earl, created this franchise. It's easy to brag when you can honestly say that you invented stuffing things between bread. The chain also has the blessing of the 11th Earl of Sandwich and have a charter on the home page of their website. That's such great marketing.   I know what you're thinking: \"franchise\" is a dirty word, especially on Yelp!. But no, this is a good sort of franchise, along the lines of Chick-Fil-A or In-N-Out or some other hyphenated chain.  You'll notice that they have images of 18th century individuals and a mug of the Earl himself on the soda cups of the restaurant. There's a Samuel Adams-esque quality about the place.   The sandwiches here are not too large, but the flavors stand out and ingredients are fresh. The bread is amazing, firm, but soft when you bite into it. The spreads were very unique, a cross between a honey mustard and barbecue sauce. I ordered the Earl's Club sandwich and I was very pleased to find that the turkey was moist, instead of dry and salty.  I would say that this franchise is a cross among Corner Bakery, Panera and Lawry's Carvery. They give you a buzzer (at least at this location) and you come back to pick up your sandwich when it's done. Even though the sandwiches take a little longer to make, it's well worth it and you can definitely taste the quality.   This particular location is in the Miracle Mile shops in the Planet Hollywood hotel on the Strip. It's like the first thing you'll notice when you enter the mall from the south entrance. The seats spill onto the mall corridor and always seem to be crowded, the latter definitely being a good sign of good shit.  So this great place, along with Dunkin' Donuts, are institutions that I have to hit up whenever I'm in Sin City. I don't care what it takes, write a damn petition to the Earl himself and have him set up shop on this far-flung former colony I call western America.",

    "text": "My sister and I had headed over to Planet Hollywood to try Earl of Sandwich on Saturday afternoon as we wanted something close by and not terribly expensive. Despite the massive line that greeted us when we arrived, it actually moved quickly and we waited for no more than 10-15 minutes before we were able to place our order.   My caprese sandwich was really good. I wasn't sure about it being classified as a \"hot sandwich\" on the menu when I ordered it (not really a fan of warm tomatoes) but it was really tasty. It was warmed just enough to crisp the bread and make the mozzarella even more tender. My sister loved her Earl's Club (turkey, bacon, cheese) as well. For the two sandwiches, two cookies, and two sodas, our bill was $21 which is not a bad price at all, especially since we left satisfied and full.   Since this is such a popular place, seating can be tricky to find, so be patient. Thankfully it's just a sandwich place, so turnover at the tables is pretty good as long as people don't linger once they are done. For a reasonable priced and good lunch in Vegas, Earl of Sandwich is a great option.",

I had the Full Montague the first night, which was bomb. 2nd night I had the Earl's Club, which was great too. Frozen lemonade also hits the spot, just like the kind they serve at amusement parks but better.   I went there with friends and they all got different sandwiches too and none of them were disappointed by what they got. Any choice on the menu will be good.  $6 per sandwich, which may look small but fills you up.",

And if you're up for dessert, the double chocolate ice cream sandwich is SUPERB. If you're a fan of the Toll House variety, this one's even better.  Could they use a better drink selection? Well, for a sandwich shop, it's actually pretty good.  I just can't find any negatives here. 5 stars FTW.",

My second favourite sandwich is their The Full Montagu - a tasty hearty classic sandwich which is perfect for meat and cheese lovers.  They serve decent tomato soups - I don't recommend it as it taste like instant packaged soups.   When I visited Vegas, I ate at Earl of Sandwich almost everyday! I witnessed two supervisors regularly overseeing the staff making the sandwiches.  Therefore, the sandwiches turn out to be very high quality is very consistant. Sandwiches were always very warm, packaged in aluminum packaging, and high quality ingredients are used.   I'm very impressed with the quality of the sandwiches and this place is the place to eat if you want something reasonably priced and tasty!  Earl of Sandwich should be introduced to Canada. I am sure a lot of people are sick of Subway and Quizno's because Earl of Sandwich sets the new benchmark for tasty sandwiches",

Come on, how can that be? Had to find out. It's located inside of Planet Hollywood so it is not that easy to get to. There is almost ALWAYS a line from what I hear, especially around 2am-4am after the clubs. The place is clean, well lit and there are about 10-12 different sandwiches. Our group tried the Montagu and Italian sandwiches along with the soup. They also offer different salads and desserts. Everything they had displayed looked wonderful. The prep time for the sandwiches was short and everything came out piping hot. The anticipation was killing me. With my first bite, I was deeply in love. I had to sit back in my chair and contain myself. I really needed to take my time with this sandwich! The Italian was so tasty and delicious. The sandwich is soft, not soggy... with italian dressing. I normally cannot finish a full sandwich but I sure finished this one! The Montagu was great as well but the winner is the Italian!!! I also tried the Chicken soup which was good, the Cheese soup not so great. I am in love. Too bad long distance relationships don't work because I live like 4 hours away. Till the day we meet again Earl, I will think of you everyday....",

I may have to stop by on my way to the airport next time and bring some home with me. =) You think i'm kidding lol.    Highly recommend you try every sandwich on the menu once....well, as many as you can lol.  The Caribbean Jerk Chicken is amazing! The American and The Original 1762 are tops on my list also.

Day 2 recommend salad over soup, great Baja chicken salad. They don't go cheap on toppings! More chicken and avocado and extras than romaine. Soup was too tiny day before. And the Avocado BLT is my favorite now. Cooked a little crispier like a blt should. Bacon thin but tasty and cooked perfect. Great Sammie. They do not have the Caribbean Jerk sandwich anymore :(",

It was very average, not bad but nothing to write home about. Claimed there was horseradish on it but I couldn't taste it so I asked for a side of horseradish and I was handed a cup with something that resembled what's inside the packets at Arby's (although Arby's is better).

I'm not sure of a Sandwich place in Vegas that has more review than Earl... it is just that damn popular.  I came back here with our group for lunch and got a the Earl Club, from what I remember the first time I went it was basically the same.  Not the insanely best sandwich I've ever had but very good compared to any other run of the mill Vegas sammy.  Friend grabbed a Gatorade too before our epic day partying began, which seemed to trickle down to most of the group.    Luckily we snagged a table large enough to fit our group and began the pre-partying right there.  Stayed a good while here, getting to know one another, and swapping those delicious sandwiches around.  One strange thing is that the sandwiches seem to turn out slightly smaller than you might think they'd be... damn pictures!  I remember someone in our group ordering two, haha.  I think this place might be one of the sole reasons to visit Planet Hollywood... other than the shopping?  Still I can't believe how popular this place has become since I last ate here.",

After several friends raving and bragging about this place, I told myself I definitely have to see how good a sandwich can be. Hands down the best sandwich place I have ever been to. The Carribbean Chicken Jerk, Hawaiian, and Earl's Club Meat hot panini sandwiches were all freaking delicious.  The panini bread was warm, crispy, and perfect with every bite of cheese, meat, and vegetable. Each sandwich had its own sauce and the sauce was not overpowering the meat itself. After eating our sandwiches, we had to order some to go just incase our drunken early morning grub arrives.  I love this place!! My must go to place in Vegas!!",

My bf and I were staying at PH and we stopped by for lunch when my cousin insisted we try the sandwiches here. The line was long but it moved quickly. I loved the tuna melt. I'm usually a half sandwich person but I was very tempted to finish the other half. The bread was delicious. I went back to it after the pool and it tasted even better. My bf got the original and he really liked it too. I think I'd be ok ditching fine dining for an earl sandwich. $6 a sandwich is like an insignificant amount of change in vegas and it fills you up nicely. The frozen lemonade was a bit too sweet though. This place is now on my list for all future vegas trips!",

We settled on the Caribbean Jerk Chicken sandwich. I wish since it was our first time we would've gotten the original because I think I would've liked it better and come back. The Caribbean jerk chicken was not at all Caribbean-y. None of that sauce that reminds me of jerk chicken. It was more like grilled chicken with red and banana peppers. The chicken strips in it were really moist and tender. And I think my favorite part was the bread. Right amount of thickness. Warm and crunchy on the outside but not chip-your-tooth tough, soft in the middle but not mushy. The line is ridiculously long and the seating area is too small for everyone who is trying to eat here. I'm holding out hope that they are better than their Caribbean jerk chicken sandwich so I will be back to taste their other sandwiches.",

You either flew out to Vegas or drove hours to get here, at least satisfy your taste buds with not only something new and limited in locations, but something hot and yummyyyy (no, I'm not talking about the boys from Thunder from Down Under).  Caribbean Jerk Chicken, hands down, my favorite. Spicy, sweet and toasted, just the way I like it! But if you're not feeling the spicy and sweet, the menu is stacked with options suitable for anyone's taste: meat lovers, veggie lovers, exotic taste buds. Anyone! Just have one of these before the club or after, and it gets the job done AKA it does a great job of soaking up all the alcohol you've consumed! Plus, how could you refuse a cheap sandwich??? Less than $7, come onnnnn! A good quality sandwich is worth itttt.  So to summarize my review: screw the $5 footlongs and come get some good ol' Earl of Sandwichhhh!",

In fact, we probably would have gotten our sandwiches if it weren't for the fact that the pager they gave us, didn't work! :(  What we ordered:  The Montague- which was one of the sandwiches that most people on Yelp loved.  I liked the combination of vegetables and meat in it.  I think I enjoyed the roast beef more than the turkey though, because the turkey's texture was a little too smooth for it to seem natural.  Anyway, overall the sandwich was okay.  I can't say that I will be craving it any time soon.  The Original- I really didn't like this sandwich.  The roast beef seemed more dry in this one, maybe because it didn't have the delicious sauce that they put on the Montague.  Anyway, I found myself wanting only to eat the bread.  Which now brings me to the bread.  I think what makes these sandwiches tasty is the actual bread, everything else is just okay.  But for around 6 bucks, there's really nothing to complain about.    If I had the opportunity I probably would like to try something different, to see if I change my mind.",

We came here two times, and the first time I ordered the All American and then the second time I tried the Earl Club.  Both were hot, fresh, and delicious, but I liked the All American better (seriously, ranch and cranberries?  NOMNOM).

Found in the Planet Hollywood Hotel/Casino, there sat a crowd of people and a line in front of the register awaiting their turn.. I was thinking, are you serious? Dude, there's like a ton of other places to grab something to eat, are these all yelp people here? haha! Whatever, I would of waited an hour to try this place.  The breakdown:  Full Montagu: great combination of quality meat, veggies tasted fresh, bread wasn't the normal subway style bread I was expecting but it was soft and delicious.  Holiday Turkey: I almost cried after eating this!! You know the \"Bobbie\" sandwich from Capriotti's?.. Well, this is similar but to the 10th degree!! This sandwich was out of control! The turkey meat soft and juicy and cranberry filling was sweet and mouth watering!.. It really is indescribable, try it yourself.. I think its only available for a limited time, don't miss out.. Trust me  Tuna Melt: Unbelieveably Fluffy and another Jackpot Sandwich that I don't have words to describe. One of the Best Tuna Melts I've ever had! And I love Tuna Melts and have tried many different ones..  Best BLT: Bold name for this sandwich, which does taste how it should. You really can't go wrong with bacon, lettuce and tomato. Nothing special though.  Meatball: A little salty for my taste but nevertheless it was good. I love meatball sandwiches and I've tried many others better than this.   Honorable Mentions:  HOLIDAY TURKEY = 6/5 Stars TUNA MELT = 6/5 Stars FULL MONTAGU = 4.5/5 Stars",

Forget you ever had sandwiches, because if you tried the melt-in-your-mouth Montagu, it makes all the sandwiches you ever had in your life seem like Lunchables cracker stackers.  Amaaazzing!!  This was one of those times I forgot to take a picture, because the food was so good.  I definitely will go back!",

    "text": "Never before have I felt so noble in Vegas for such a low price.  Would one rather have a $2000 Bottle Service @ Marquee, or 650 sandwiches from Earl of Sandwich (i.e. sandwiches for life)?  I would have to lean with the latter as every Earl's delcicious, piping-hot sandwich I've had has been deliciOUS  If you're a fan of freshly baked bread that's magically soft and tender on the insides, yet baked and firm on the outside, you have found your nirvana.  Next, each sandwich is comprised of an ample amount of meat/lettuce/dressings/etc where each and every delightful bite is full of flavor and satisfaction.    If only they played EDM....Earl's would be borderline culinary bliss.  Their pricing is extremely competitive, especially for the Vegas Strip. Each sandwich is priced @ $5.99, with additional costs for double meat (really not necessary).  Another amazing aspect of Earls? IT\"S OPEN 24 HOURS A DAY!!! Which means, one can wander over there drunk, intoxicated, and eat probably the best tasting sandwich in drunken memory and then even bring one back in case you happen to throw up before the night.  Unlike the other 24 hr joints, which tend to have long, inefficient waits, the line @ earls breezes through as they have an awesome system of those vibrating ringers that alerts you when your sandwich is ready.  Recommendations: The Montagu, Hawaiian BBQ, Earl's Club (only if you like bacon as it has a prominent taste in the sandwich).    Overall, I think this how become my favorite place to eat in Vegas and I would gladly recommend anyone who throughly enjoys hot sandwiches to eat here.  They do have veggie options for those who have decidedly to foolishly deprive themselves of meat :P",

Anyways.. after losing my funds and some of my boyfriend's winnings I decided to walk outside and explore the strip. Freakin' Circus Circus had to be AT THE OTHER END OF THE STRIP of all the goodies it was little of a journey.   After about three miles to Planet Hollywood I saw Earl of Sandwich. Large menu. Lots of college lookin students working the sammich line. Picked the Tuna Melt many people rave about, the earl club sandwich, fruit cup, orange concentrated juice, and some hot tea.  My boyfriend... after reading a couple reviews and trecking in the cold Vegas weather at the time.. he wanted this sandwich to be the best sandwich in the world. He was disappointed. Tuna Melt had a nice texture to it. Crispy and gooy. Mmm The Club sandwich was great too. After I doused it with HOT SAUCE! yea. I'd come back if I was starving and in good company.   Damn Vegas...",

    "text": "Tucked inside the Planet Hollywood Casino, the Earl of Sandwich has received quite the praise from the Yelp community.  However, there is nothing entirely unique about what in my mind really amounts to something that I wouldn't be surprised to receive at Potbelly's or Quizno's.  Sure, Vegas needs cheap food as well, and Earl of Sandwich certainly qualifies.  However, for all the people who are practically nutting about a sandwich that uses good bread and good meat in a wholly predictable manner, I'm just going to have to say that I'm missing the allure entirely.    I ordered the Full Montague as a hangover cure following a night of extravagant drinking.  It's basically a roast beef and turkey sandwich lined with cheddar and swiss cheese.  Condiments?  A row of lettuce and tomatoes are included along with a line of mustard.    That's really it.  There isn't anything magical about it at all.  I'm not going to dock it for my moderate disappointment (after all, it absolutely housed Marilyn's Cafe which was at a similar price point), but I'm not going to pretend it was something more than an average experience.  I'd go here again if I wanted something fast and cheap.",

Many people mentioned that their sandwiches are huge and big enough to share...I disagree though (but perhaps I'm spoiled by the ginormous sandwiches in the Bay Area).  Anyway, I shared the Caribbean Jerk Chicken Sandwich and a cup of Clam Chowder with my boyfriend and I thought that was the perfect amount of food.  The sandwich was grilled to a perfect crisp and the chicken was very moist.  The sauce added the right amount of tang and kick and the banana peppers added the perfect extra crunch.  I would definitely recommend that sandwich.  The clam chowder on the other hand was very mediocre and not something that I would get again.  We had a 10% (or 15%?) off coupon from the Miracle Mile Coupon Book (available at the information desk...just present your key card if you are staying at PH or mention the Southwest Spirit Magazine) so our total came out to be a little under $9, which is an awesome deal for lunch for two in Vegas ;)  Best of all, Earl of Sandwich is open 24/7 so you can grab an awesome cheap meal any time of the day!",

    "text": "Finally decided to write a review for this place after coming here several times. This place is one of the most budget-friendly, yet delicious places you can find around the strip.   The menu here is loaded with deliciousness. So many choices to choose for and most choices can be had for around $6 dollars. Their bread is amazing and they really make sure you get the best bang for your buck by stuffing your sandwich. I got the carribean jerk chicken this time around and the delicious grilled peppers went perfectly with the cheesy and the tender chicken. The bread here is also high quality bread- crunchy on the outside and extremely toasty on the inside.  Big NOTE: the line always looks intimidating here, but it actually moves pretty quickly. They do a really good job of moving people in and out of the line as soon as possible.  Gotta come here again and try em' all!",

Italian: yummy pizza sandwich Earl's club: mmm....classic with a lil kick and zest from the sauce Ham and cheese: deliciously cheesey  Everything is on ciabatta bread for the low price of $5.99!

My first Earl of Sandwich experience was in Atlantic City, and I absolutely hated it. I felt like the sandwiches were poor quality, the bread was hard and stale, and it just wasn't anything special or rave-worthy.  Needless to say, I was very hesitant about trying it again. Surprisingly, the Vegas location is much better managed, orders are ready in a reasonable amount of time, and the food was delightfully awesome! Affordable at $7-$8, these sandwiches are very tasty, the bread and ingredients are fresh, and surely big enough to satisfy any hunger pains whether they be from normal lunch hour or post-clubbing munchies, because they're open 24/7!  Earl of Sandwich is definitely the go-to place for an affordable and relatively quick meal. I actually really enjoyed this location, even if it reminded me of a less-glorified panera. I personally recommend the Hawaiian ;)",

I come here so often that I know exactly how much my order will cost.  Cup of Chicken Noodle Soup (marvelous after-draaanking) Earl Club = $9.71  Pregame. Club. PH. Earl's. Vitamin before bed. KO.

I dont know if its because of the bread or bc i partied so hard the night before but these sandwich are to die for. I usually get the Original - roast beef, cheddar and horseradish spread. The toasted meat with the melted cheese and the spice of the horseradish is a perfect combination of deliciousness   Sandwiches are around 6-7$ which is a steal for eating on the strip. One sandwich usually fills me up but I usually order an extra for late night munchies after a night out. And if you didnt take my advice about ordering extra, Earls is open 24 HOURS so you can get toasted sandwiches all day!!",

    "text": "I have eaten here the past 2 years that I have visited Las Vegas and stayed at Planet Hollywood. It's open 24 hours and the menu offers lots of variety!  I had the Earl's club - but instead of the sandwich sauce (thousand island dressing) I substituted for Mayo. I also had the Thai Chicken Salad - it comes with some thai sauce on the chicken already so you don't even really need the thai dressing that also comes with it. Lettuce is fresh and doesn't taste stale like other packaged salads. the chicken was cold though to my surprise because it was supposed to be \"grilled\" chicken.   They also offer soups like clam chowder   Their set up is really efficient, you order at one end, move along the line past the beer and chips and then you pay at the end. The sandwiches are made assembly line style so there isn't much room for error.  After you order they give you a little buzzer thing that rings when your sandwich is up. This definitely alleviates any confusion when it's busy and the line up is really long.  I also tried the little chocolate chip mini muffins that come prepackaged in the cup (emergency breakfast food). They weren't too bad, basically tasted like chocolate chip cookies in the form of mini muffins.  For anyone staying in Planet Hollywood looking for a quick bite, (especially after a night of drinking and dancing lol) this is the perfect option!",

A hungry man will be satiated with one, very satisfied with one and a half and a little OD with two.  Pro: - wait only around 15 mins for the line and to get your food. This beats any buffet line :) - Their. Bread. Is. Soo. Soft yet slightly firm and made to perfection. It made me so. happy. - If in doubt, get THE FULL MONTAGU. It tasted the best out of the 4 we got. The Earl's club was really good too...if you like bacon :)  Cons: - The original was kind of too plain. Imagine just meat and cheese...yeahhh no thanks. - It could be a little confusing to find if you dont know that it's actually inside the hotel/casino. Guess how often we circled around!

Now that I'm back on the west coast, our nearest Earl is in Vegas so of course when I went there for my birthday I stopped on by!  The line is usually insanely long if you come around noon but it moves really really fast. I usually order the Hawaiian BBQ and Cannonballs, both are delicious. Cannonballs is the kind of sandwich you can just bring around with you and it'll still be delicious cold! Also, I have a weakness for their original chips. OMG! How I've missed it!  Earl of Sandwich is a great place to grab a bite and it's significantly cheaper than most places on the strip not to mention probably better for your health-wise. The only down fall is that the location is sort of small, but they offer more tables over towards the mall side.  Another plus? This place is open 24 hours a day! :D",

Nothing falling or hanging out as you take your bites, but also no empty space at the ends of the sandwich. Also, the bread is soft, and slightly crunchy without tearing the roof of your mouth. Y'all know what I mean, right? I get so disappointed at the places that toast their bread to make it crunchy, but they over-toast it and it gets stiff on the outside and cuts up your palate or gums whne you bite into it. None of that here! It's ultimate perfection!",

The combination of everything,,,,bread, chicken, pineapple, sauce,,,,,is just perfect! I gotta say it's a really good sandwich.

    "text": "\"The World's Greatest Hot Sandwich\"   Hardly.  If you truly believe that, then you've never eaten at Ike's in San Francisco. (<a href=\"http://www.yelp.com/biz/ikes-place-san-francisco\">yelp.com/biz/ikes-place-...</a>)  Ike's Dutch Crunch bread puts Earl's \"artisan\" bread to shame and while I would love to go off on the variety of sandwiches Ike's has compared to Earl's, and the fact that the Ike's Dirty Sauce just kills everything else Earls could even offer, I won't.  Is it fair to compare the two? Well, when you have a tag line like \"The World's Greatest Hot Sandwich\"... well you better have the-worlds-greatest-hot-sandwich.   I tried 3 different sandwiches just to get a grasp of what they were doing:  Full Montague - nothing special Italian - my favorite of the 3, but it's hard to go wrong with salami, capicola, mozzarella, etc. Caribbean Jerk Chicken - not a fan of this flavor profile  Actually, my favorite thing they had there was what I pulled out of the freezer... the Brownie Cream Pie. I'm not a dessert person, but the brownie was rich without being too sweet and went well with the ice cream.   I guess you could say this review is a hype vs reality thing. I don't know if everyone is just so drunk and hung over that their taste buds are out of whack or, the fact that the shape and wrapper give everyone the illusion that they are about to eat something \"golden\", but realize this sandwich is just a small step up from Quizno's... It's good bite to eat when your on the strip and need quick fix, but let's keep it real folks... 3 stars is being generous. (That's more a of a quality to value rating more than anything)",

    "text": "Sandwiches get no closer to perfection than the ones at Earl of Sandwich.  On my last visit to Vegas, we made treks to Earl of Sandwich after clubbing at TAO and Marquee on two different nights. True, I was drunk off my ass both times, and so that could have greatly influenced my love for each bite of my sandwich. But, honestly, my measure of Earl's greatness is that I actually remember each delicious bite in what was otherwise a night of blurry flashbacks. I can still taste my Tuna Melt sandwich, even to this day, and it brings back such fond memories of a time when life was truly great.  Additionally, I brought back a Caribbean Jerk Chicken back to my hotel room, passing out before I could touch it. I woke up the next morning, hungover and hating life -- the last thing I could think about was food. However, I took one bite of that cold Caribbean Jerk Chicken that was sitting out for over 8 hours in the hotel room and even THAT was damn delicious.   On my third visit (in the same weekend to Earl's), I got the Caribbean Jerk Chicken sandwich again since I wanted to try it how it was intended (hot and crispy). It went amazingly well with my bowl of Tomato Bisque.  I'm the type of person who strives to try new places all of the time. If I'm in Vegas for 2 days, then I will make it a mission to try a new place every meal. I very rarely ever go back to the same place twice in the same week, let alone the same 2 days.  Earl of Sandwich is so good that I not only ate it 3 times in the span of 2 days, but I was craving it all the way home. Now THAT is the only indicator you need to let you know that you've stumbled upon something phenomenal.",

There are no other places on the strip that have such affordable prices for such delicious hot sandwiches.

I would stay at Planet Hollywood just because they have this place downstairs near the Casino.   I've tried a few of the sandwiches and they are all very good. But my favorite has to be the All-American! Hot turkey cranberry sandwich with ranch? You can't beat that!  If you're staying in any hotel near to Planet Hollywood, you HAVE to go give Earl's a try.

The line is pretty long but it goes by quick! and there's always a place to sit cause people just sit, eat and go. or most people will just take it to go. Surprisingly their salads here are pretty good.. for a sandwich place. but yeah I love the Earl's club, the tuna one is good, the montague is pretty good too, the one with the chicken is good too... yea they're all pretty good, so yea I dont know what else to say.",

Luckily for Earl of Sandwich, the bread has a light crisp on the outside with a moist, soft, and chewy texture on the inside... no cutting the roof of your mouth here... thank you sandwich gods!  As a first timer this weekend, I decided to try the original sandwich..the meat to bread ratio was decent and the horseradish sauce was not too over powering in flavor; great compliment for the thinly sliced and tender roast beef and cheese...  I was able to taste my friend's club sandwich which was equally as heavenly as mine. For the price, portion, and quality, this sandwich has amazing value...half of one sandwich and some chips made me full but the fatty inside me could not put it down... i had to finish it while it was still warm LOL  Definitely gonna be back to try more on their menu on my next visit to Sin City.",

I stole a bite from my friend's tuna melt and I've been dreaming about it ever since...I might just have to take a trip to Vegas to get my fix.  Is it just me or did anyone notice the significance of \"Earl of Sandwich?\" The word \"earl\" is associated with \"sovereign prince,\" \"ruler of designated territory,\" \"duke,\" etc (according to Wiki)...Like John Wilmot, Earl of Rochester. HELLO?! Is it just me or is this revelation AWESOME? Earl of Sandwich...the person still remains nameless, but nevertheless, this mysterious person is still the earl...of sandwich.  UPDATE: My friend just told me that there actually was an Earl of Sandwhich, Edward Montagu, of Sandwhich, Kent, England and I sorta, kinda, maybe, slightly feel stupid, but whatevers. Earl of Sandwhich still rocks!",

As for service they get 1 star! they suck!! it's a long line, the food takes long, and we didn't get one of our order and to top it off they did not apologize nor did they show a sense of urgency or anything. They suck! It was the supervisor too. So we got a refund. tisk tisk.   Stupid yummy sandwiches.  BTW you're looking at $7 a sandwich!",

I recommend you eat one sandwich there while it's warm, then pick up a few sandwiches to bring back to your room too.  I'm sure it'll be a good eat when you're buzzed or drunk.  I ordered the All-American sandwich, which is basically turkey and cranberry sauce.  It was probably one of the top 3 sandwiches I've ever eaten and I eat a lot of sandwiches.  I'm not sure what I liked most about the sandwich, most likely it was the warm bread.  You could tell they used quality ingredients for the whole sandwich, so it could have been that too.  I only have two regrets about my experience; only going there once on my 4 days in LV and not ordering the turkey and bacon, because I was trying to eat a little healthier.  Damn you fit people at the pool making me self conscious about my belly!!!",

I got the Earl Club and my boyfriend initially ordered the Caribbean Jerk Chicken. The jerk sauce that comes with it is a mayo-based one, which is not what we were looking for. So my boyfriend exchanged it for the The Original 1762 (minus the horseradish), which he enjoyed.   My Club sandwich was tasty, but not oh-so-amazing. Their bread is pretty light and toasty, which I liked more than your chain sandwich joints (eg. quiznos), and their deli meat is just standard, not like from a real deli. That being said, they make a pretty good sandwich with the ingredients they use. Not to mention, it is really cheap and 24 hours!   I'll definitely be back if I'm craving a sandwich in Vegas, but I don't think I'll be dreaming about those subs :)",

A bewildered look thinking that I'm crazy to want to wait in a line that long for a sandwich.  How could could a sandwich really be right?  WRONG.  The sandwich is that damn good and I made a believer out of each and every one of them.  The moment we got to the Miracle Mile area and they saw the line, they turned around and wanted to just go to McDonald's.  But as fate would have it, we ended up walking around the Miracle Mile for a bit and on our way back the line died down quite a bit.  It actually moves pretty fast, so don't be fooled by the length.  That's what she said...  I ordered the Full Montagu and others ordered the Earl's Club.  Once we got their food, all my friends were talking smack about how ridiculous the line was but the moment they put the sandwich in their mouth...they all shut up.  One friend literally dropped his sandwich and said this was one of the best sandwiches he's ever had.  The must sprinkle crack in these sandwiches because everyone was hooked from then on.   Great food and an affordable price on the strip.  I know I know...its unheard of right?  But Earl of Sandwich proves itself to be an exception the rule.  A must try for Vegas visitors!",

It wasn't bad and it was very tasty but every bite made me think, \"oh god, how many calories am I consuming now with all that mayo?\"  Generally though, it's not a bad place for a quick meal even though my friend's wrap looked like all wrap and no filling. My other friend thought his sandwich was good. You order at the counter and wait for your food to be ready for pick up. The bright lights of the place kept any sort of rowdiness down.",

We get there and there is a small line (awesome!) and it moved very fast. I opted for the American (turkey, cheddar, tomato, lettuce, cranberries and ranch dressing). My man decided on the club with no tomato. It arrived quickly and was one of the better sandwiches I have had in the past 30 years. Top it off with my favorite chips and soda (salt and vinegar and Tropicana Twister orange) and I was in heaven. The bread was the best part of it...crispy, hot yet soft in the middle.  I will be back very soon to try more (at $5.99 a pop...that's so cheap by Vegas Strip standards). One word of caution to this happy tale...I would imagine it gets insanely crowded Thursday through Saturday so try to hit this place up Monday-Wednesday. Just a thought.",

    "text": "I've only heard of Earl of Sandwich in Las Vegas even though it appears that the company has been around far before I was born, and it recently opened another location right in the center of downtown Disneyland! I only live about 20 minutes from Disneyland, but I would rather have my first taste of an Earl sandwich in Las Vegas, the one that it is known for!   I wish I was more hungry for a sandwich since Earl is known for that, but I opted to go a little healthy & asked for the berry salad which came with strawberries, blueberries, spinach, chicken, and almond slivers. Those ingredients itself was already calling my name. Maybe because mine was a salad that I did not find it to be that memorable as everyone claims Earl to be. The salad was fresh and the fruits were even better, but it was just quite plain and ordinary for me. My darling had the Full Montagu which had roasted beef, turkey, Swiss, cheddar, lettuce, tomato & mustard sauce. I took a bite, and it was yummy, but seemed kind of like an ordinary sandwich to me. Hmm.  I really do want to give Earl another chance, perhaps the one at Disneyland next time, and I will update this review again once I try one of their special sandwiches to myself x",

It's open 24 hours, very affordable, centrally located, and DELICIOUS whether you're sober or drunk. Seating area isn't that big; maybe my friends and I are just lucky but we always find a table no matter what time we go, even when things seem busy.  A bonus is that it's across the way from some bar in the Miracle Shops that plays really good hip hop and R&B music (at least on the Friday night we went).",

    "text": "Out of all the places in Vegas and among all the crazy priced eateries, you have this gem that's tucked away in Planet Hollywood.  While it's pretty much in the Miracle Mile Mall it's not really what I would say is \"In Planet Hollywood\" (probably easier to find if I say it's in the mall).  I've personally never been to Earl of Sandwich.  While the idea that there was once a mythical Earl of a place called Sandwich is up for debate (and probably debunked) but none the less, I had to try it from all the people that recommended it.  The best way to describe Earl's is what would happen if you took Arbys, made it good, and then added a selection like Panera Bread.  I didn't really feel adventurous so I just ordered the \"Original\".  Basically it was roast beef, with horseradish sauce and cheese.  They make it fresh to order and nice and hot so I was pretty excited.  After taking a couple bites, you start to understand why they're so good.  The roast beef is actually really tender and soft.  It tastes like rare prime rib and not like your deli sliced well done leather consistancy.  Add to that a horseradish sauce that actually has some kick to it and OMG it was amazing.  DEFINITELY recommend the original.  I honestly didn't notice the cheese very much.  The horseradish and the beef were definitely the star players in this game.  I liked it so much that I went back in the morning.  At under 10 dollars for a sandwich you can't really beat it.  I'd much rather go here than a ridiculously overpriced plate of Ramsey's finest.  I know royalty when I see it, and his name is the Earl of Sandwich.",

You'll probably be waiting at least 20 minutes, but the line goes fast.  My favorite is the Meatball sandwich. The bread is really good and toasty. They pack the sandwich full of meatballs and marinara sauce, with lots of gooey mozzarella cheese! The meatballs are juicy and the sauce is really flavorful. Mmmm its so warm and delicious in your tummy, especially at 3am, when you're freezing in a cold air-conditioned hotel. Last time, I also got the broccoli cheese soup with my sandwich. It was piping hot and super creamy and delish!  I've only been to the Vegas location, but they now have one closer to me in Downtown Disney, but I have yet to try it at that location.

You order, take your buzzer down the line and then pay and have a seat.   The sandwich was out fast, and for such a long line, there was seat readily available. Did I mention this is 24 hours?  AMAZING. I went back another day and had the same thing, the bread is what makes it - crunchy on the outside but too doughy and filling... so good. It's good buzzed, drunk, or sober, just GOOD. I dream of this sandwich. Best BLT ever.  The tomato soup had garlic (I think) croutons floating in it which is awesome, and the chicken noodle was thick and very flavorful !",

The Full Montagu ($7.45) - This consisted of roast beef, turkey, swiss cheese, cheddar cheese, lettuce, tomato and a mustard sauce.  A choice of white or wheat bread is available.  My buddy ordered a wheat one and I went with the white.  The sandwiches are cut into 2 and each piece appears to be about 4\".  It's not a big sandwich, but it's a fairly good tasting sandwich.  There's a decent amount of meat and the bread is soft on the outside and crispy on the inside.  For $2 more one can get a double order of meat on any sandwich.  Overall I enjoyed my sandwich and the pricing is reasonable for the quantity being offered.  I'll definitely stop by when I need a quick and affordable byte to eat in the Las Vegas area.

I love that they are open 24/7 and make delicious sandwiches quickly and for pretty cheap.  We were starving after a late flight into Las Vegas so decided to grab some food from this place as it was near our hotel. The staff are very efficient and they are able to get food out quickly. We got the chipotle chicken avocado ($7.50) and turkey club ($7.50). Both were really good and had nice crispy toasted bread on the outside. I especially liked the sauces, which were flavorful but not overpowering. It also felt relatively healthy, which is a plus!",

We love this place, and we go here often for lunch and breakfast, especially if we happen to be staying near Planet Hollywood. There is something about the quality of ingredients they're using along with the toasted sandwich that is just magical. It always has the perfect amount of sauce to meat/veggie/cheese ratio. The price is right, of course, but I would pay more just for the quality of sandwich you're getting here.  Pro tip, download their app and mobile order! This place can get crazy busy, so if you can pre-order via the app, you'll save a lot of time. You can also customize really well on the app, like extra cheese, sauce, no tomato, etc...If you've never tried this place, just go. I recommend the holiday turkey or the full montague or, well...I've never had a bad sandwich here. They used to make a Jamaican jerk chicken sandwich that was amazing (PLEASE BRING IT BACK!).   If you have tried this place, I'm just preaching to the choir. Sandwich church is out! May the Earl be with you!",

I tend to always order the Roast Beef at every new sandwich shop I go to...so this place is no different.  Add into the fact that most of the crew ordered their special or the Italian....so I chose to be different.  All I can is...my sandwich is juicy..tender...tastes great with the creamy horseradish sauce all for under $10.  I wished the portion was bigger though...and...well....let's just say the rest of the night of drinking hit me harder than it should because there's not enough food in my tummy :(  Overall, pretty good sandwich to check out if you are sick of buffets, trying to kill time and don't want to gamble.",

I, on the other hand, conducted a study of my own that found in a sample size of 3, following significant consumption of alcohol, there was a 100% chance that consuming a sandwich from E of S after 3AM would be astronomically delicious.    Located just inside the entrance of Planet Hollywood facing the strip, this is the ideal place to grab a late night snack if your wallet is thin from a cooler at the casino tables ($5.99) or you're too incoherent to sit down and order from a server or drive off the strip.  From the name, it's pretty obvious that the sandwiches are the star.  My first trip we ordered the Holiday Turkey and the Carribean Jerk sandwich and the sandwiches are all wrapped in foil and shaped like gold bars.  The first thing you will notice upon taking the first bite is the amazing panini-like crunch from the exterior of the bread followed by the chewy, gooey, and occasionally crispy components within.    The Holiday Turkey pretty much tasted like Thanksgiving dinner between two amazing pieces of bread and the Carribean Jerk sandwich, albeit tasty, didn't necessarily remind me of the islands since I was expecting less mayo and more spice.  The remaining sandwiches all looked really solid, especially the Roast Beef, the Club sandwich, and the Full Montague.     Somewhere along the hallways of the pantheon of great sandwiches, the Earl himself is giving his seal of approval.",

All of their sandwiches are hot and use high quality ingredients. Of the ones I tried, the Earl's club was by far the best (I found the Chipotle Chicken Avocado a bit soggy, and the sweetness of the cranberries in the American BLT a bit distracting).   Aside from their hot sandwiches, they also offer salad, soup, wraps, dessert and breakfast sandwiches. Would definitely return the next time I'm back in Vegas.",

Ridiculously flavorful, ridiculously good. I've also tried the Hawaiian and I love it as much as I love chocolate, and I love chocolate so it's pretty understandable why I love this place. I'm kind of sad they decided to open up an Earls near downtown Disney and don't get me wrong, I'm happy at the same time that they finally decided to open up one in California, but I'm just afraid it's going to turn into a mass produced franchise and I would hate that. My boyfriend loves to get the Full Montagu and the club. If you haven't been here, you're definitely missing out.",

It's not the traditional cobb with ham, egg, corn and what not but more way yummier. I definitely loved the cranberries. The Hawaiian sandwich was also very good. I loved the bread the most. It's very square and crispy.   I don't know what the history of the sandwich is but this place claims that it invented the sandwich. That's quite a nifty fact.  Earl of Sandwich is a great stop for a quick bite that won't blow your wallet.",

This place is definitely worthy of its high rating. If I am going to have a sandwich, I want a hot sandwich, and Earl of Sandwich specializes in hot sandwiches. They have a decent selection, but not overwhelming. You order at the first register, pay at another register down the line, and they give you a buzzer for when your sandwich is ready. The people were friendly and service was quick. My Italian was ready within 5 minutes.   I really liked the sandwich. The dressing they used was especially flavorful.  It is not a large sandwich but I am not a huge eater so it satisfied my appetite. I don't recall seeing an option for a larger version. Might be an issue for a big eater.

Luckily, he remembered this place when he went for a quick weekend getaway. He kept telling me that I shouldn't expect too much, because he didn't want to over-hype the sandwiches. So with an open mind, I ordered the club on wheat bread.   Wow...  Okay, so seriously, I don't want to hype the sandwiches for any of you, but if you're in the mood for perfectly toasted bread with great offerings in between, this is definitely the place for you. The hubs tried the Buffalo Chicken Sandwich (new on the menu), and while he liked it, he said that the club was definitely better.  So glad that we found another place in LV to put on our list of places to eat!",

    "text": "(Actual rating: maybe 3.5)  Oh Earl, creator of the Sandwich...let me start off by saying, I do enjoy a really good sandwich so thank you for the original idea.   I've heard from multiple friends and family members about the whole \"Earl of Sandwich\" hype but I never really had it high on my \"Must Try Now List\" because there are so many other good eats options in Vegas. Don't get me wrong, I'm always down for a yummy sammy but I have many other Go-To food options that I would rather have first before devouring a sandwich.   My girlfriend and I were were knocking back quite a few alcoholic drinks while shopping around at The Miracle Mile Shops (located in Planet Hollywood). So when we finally made our complete round from the shops, we found ourselves feeling a bit hungry from consuming all the drinks we had. We had a couple options to choose from but Earl of Sandwich had the shortest wait line and that alone helped us decide that a sandwich would be for us. Earl of Sandwich is located where the Miracle Mile and Casino entrance meets. They have indoor tables available if you decide to eat your sandwich on the spot.   Customer service is kinda dry. Maybe because they help thousands of semi-buzzed people a day, you would expect a little bit more life but no, the team members here are rather dry.   So you start your journey with placing your order with a team member at the first register. From there you get a vibrating pager and a receipt displaying your order. They don't ring you up just yet, because as you walk through you are able to grab cold pasta salads, chips, drinks and desserts to add to your order. The second register is where you finalize your order and pay. We waited probably about 10 minutes until our sandwich order was ready.  Here is what we ordered:  1. The Original Earl 2. Chicken Chipotle, Bacon and Avocado 3. Mac n' Cheese  The bread made in house, which feels like a soft version of a ciabatta. It's soft enough to bite into without hurting the roof of your mouth. All in all I'm going to rate the sandwiches as one.  I've had better sandwiches, and to be honest these sandwiches are just OKAY, nothing too special. The Mac was pretty good, but again t wasn't the best Mac I've ever had. I think people rave about these sandwiches and say these are amazing because they are \"hammered\" at the time when they have it and anything will sound amazing once you're at that point because you're already drunk.   Here is my final verdict: I don't think these are the most amazing sandwiches in the world, and I don't think the hype should be where it's at today.  If you're hungry and need food then yes this place is for you, but they are slightly over priced and need more ingredients within the sandwich. If I'm desperate and need food, then yeah I would eat at Earl's again... But Earl's won't receive a regular visit from me every time I'm in Vegas.",

I really liked the aluminum wraps, and the feeling of a hot sandwich when I held it in my hands,   I had the MONTAGU sandwich. My first impression was the bread was warm, crispy and crunchy since it was just right out of the oven. I thought the bread was the best part of the sandwich.   The sandwich fillings were just regular turkey and roast beef, some lettuce and tomatoes. Nothing special about them. They kinda tasted bland actually. I had to put more mustard to pump up the flavors.  For drinks they hadthe lemonade tea which was quite unique, but also not that good.

I definitely will make a trip back to get it. Be sure to add peppercini to your sandwich for an added kick! Their sides are also very delicious especially the fresh potato salad. Everything is quite affordable ~$8 a person",

The combination of meats and flavors they use makes you smile with every bite!  The sandwiches cost $6.99-$7.49 depending on the one you choose. Try them all if you have to, they use the same bread for every sandwich, and I think that's the game changer.  The service is quick, although one time we had an employee that was texting on their phone for 10 minutes without looking up while we were waiting for them. She then completely messed up on our order.  I recommend this place to anyone who loves sandwiches and is looking for a cheap and quick meal.",

The Chipotle Chicken Avocado is our favorite and I can't live without it. Sometimes I get two, to eat in one sitting, or to save for later (you can never go wrong with ordering 2 sandwiches).  There are crazy lines during peak hours and YES the sandwich sizes have gotten smaller and smaller and prices have gone up so minus a star for that in hopes that one day the sandwiches may go back to the size they used to be :,(  Also wraps are tasty too but avoid the salad!!

If so, you're crazy if you don't place Earl of Sandwich on your shortlist of destinations that are wallet friendly.   Upon arrival, there was a long line of individuals, yet it moved expeditiously. The menu is relatively simple, showcasing a smattering of signature sandwiches. I opted to try the Earl's Club that consisted of roasted turkey, smoked bacon, aged swiss, lettuce, and tomatoes. Wow! So delicious. The bread, too, was surprisingly fresh. My travel companion ordered the Hawaiian Barbeque that was constructed of ham, chicken, swiss, pineapple and bbq sauce. Staggeringly good!   In addition to my sandwich, I also had a small cup of the broccoli and cheddar soup. It was hot, creamy, and packed with rich flavor. Impressive.  For a little over $5 a sandwich, it's really hard to do much better on price, especially considering you're on the Strip. My only quibble is that the sandwich wasn't quite big enough for me, but, thankfully, it provided the essential sustenance that ensured I didn't leave ravenous for more food. It was just enough to get me through what remained of the night.   Oh, and here's a logistical tip:  The Chandelier, a fantastic bar located inside The Cosmpolitan, is just across the street from Earl of Sandwich. Nothing like having a fantastic martini after consuming a mouth-watering sammie.",

Just imagine a ham and cheese hot pocket, except way better bread and replace the ham with tuna. And the cheese, there's like 10xs way more cheese than a hot pocket.

There are a ton of locations in Florida but that doesn't do me much good. I once drove by one at 3:00am on the way to Miami but it was closed!!! Anyways I have been here three times now, but this past time was special because I was sober enough to fully enjoy the sandwich! LOL Not to say that Earls isn't good drunk food, because trust me, it is!  This particular location is located at Planet Hollywood right when you walk in. Stop walking past in hopes you will find something else, you won't. This is as good as it gets for fast cheap excellent food. The first sandwich I ever tried was the Earl's Club and I cannot steer away from it. Recently I added avocado and WOWZER, took me to an entire new level. The bread and sauce make the sandwich here, the way they slow toast it makes it so yummy!!  PLEASE OPEN A EARL OF SANDWICH IN THE SOUTH BAY!! /begging.",

You sign up for their emails to get free sandwich with no purchase necessary. Awesome deal!    I almost forgot, cashier came across like she hated her job, or me? Just unlikable.",

    "text": "Earl of Sandwich serves $6 sandwiches 24 hours a day. The problem is that the one and only sandwich I tried was extremely disappointing. I asked the lady at the counter for the most popular sandwich and she said, \"Get the Earl Club.\" So, I did.  Sadly, the strongest flavor for the Club was Charcoal because the crust of the Bread was burned just enough to make it snap-hard and bitter while the Bacon was 2 strips of even crunchier charcoal crisps. With skimpy toppings, light on the cheese, and not enough flavor to overcome the burnt taste, the Earl Club was a miss. I ate most of the Turkey and Cheese, but let the rest hit the trash can on the way out.  The convenience of being connected to the Planet Hollywood Casino and Miracle Mile of Shops was nice, but the Earl of Sandwich was a losing bet in a city full of great eats. Treat it as a late night stomach-stuffer for $6. Nothing more. Nothing less.",

I had the Caribbean Chicken sandwich it's hard to describe perfection but I will try. The bread was buttery kind of soft yet not hard. The chicken was tender and the sauce was the right amount of spice, sweetness,  and tang. When I was done  I wanted more. My friend had the holiday sandwich  which looked like Thanksgiving dinner in  between bread...  not something I would  ever choose but my friend loved it she said it tasted just like it looked (turkey, stuffing, gravy, cranberry sauce)price was just right for Vegas being around $7 and open 24/7.  At 4am it was a nice treat after a night on the town, it wasn't  a huge meal just enough  to not feel extremely  guilty .... beats pizza any day.",

I got Skinny turkey wrap that's only 390 calories with very thin wrap skin. Excellent if you're restricting carbs. All their dishes under $10 each so it's a great spot to fill up if you're also looking for light and healthy as well as a good budget eat in Vegas. Friendly staff.

The line was so longgg (roughly an hour!) but I was determined to see how good of a sandwich this was.   Well, I'll be damned. This sandwich was BOMB. I had the chicken chipotle without the bacon and it was delicoussss. From the bread, to the sauce, I was super happy we tried it. I also had a cup of the chicken tortilla soup. SO GOOD. And I think my group was less angry towards me for making them wait an hour of A SANDWICH once we all tried our food.   Came here again 2 nights later and the line was alot quicker (all the EDC peeps left...haha).   Go here for cheap, good food! Nothing wrong with that!",

A wide selection, open I THINK 24 hours (we came here after the club at 5 am, so it has to be open 24hrs), and just really good and affordable!!  For me I wanted something different so I chose the Caribbean Jerk Chicken Sandwich. The sandwich has Grilled Chicken, Roasted Red & Banana Peppers & Spicy Jerk Sauce. AS a hot sandwich it was FABULOUS. the bread was crispy but NOT hard. The Chicken was moist and all the toppings just tasted fresh. Move over SUBWAYS and TOGO's...I have a new love for sandwiches thanks to Earl. Why can't there be one here in California?!  I would recommend this to all my friends to definitely check out. It is affordable, the lines are long but doesn't take long, delicious, fresh and just enough to hit the spot and satisfy you for a good lunch! I give earl a 5 stars, best sandwich place I've ever been to in a while :-)",

BUT  Maybe it will be the $5.99 price tag for a hot sandwich  Maybe it will be the soft toasted bread you get your sandwich on.  Maybe it will be the fresh roast beef slices they put on your sandwich  Maybe it will be the loud drunkards you can watch spilling out of Rock Bottom while you are standing in line at Earls  Maybe it will be the gourmet brownie ice cream sandwiches they have.   Maybe your a vegetarian so this is one of the only legit places you can get a healthy/veggie meal (Veggie and Caprese sub)   Maybe it'll be the fact that since you're in Vegas you are opting to eat only one meal a day to save money for gambling.   Maybe its the fact that they are open 24/7  Do yourself a favor, stand in line (it goes by quickly) and try an Earl Sandwich. We went back twice in the 3 days we were in Vegas....

Besides the fact that this place stays open 24/7 (which I know is not uncommon in Vegas) they always hit the spot. Doesn't matter if its 5am after the club or 2pm for lunch. This last trip to Vegas I think we ate here for almost every meal and I never got sick of it. I'll break down the sandwiches I got.   Earls Club - this one is my personal favorite. It sounds basic but everything in it just works so well together and it was refreshing and juicy compared to the others. After a harsh night or partying this one was a nice pick-me-up.   The Original - this one had roast beef and like a horse radish cream sauce. This was pretty good but could have used a little more of the horse radish sauce as it got a little dry towards the end but the roast beef was cooked perfectly.   Holiday Turkey - this one is seasonal I believe but I wish it was year round. This one was amazing! I love making left over turkey sandwiches after Thanksgiving and this one was almost spot on but with better bread then I use (their bread is fresh baked and the perfect blend of soft yet sturdy).   Cannonballs - this is their meatball sandwich and this was awesome as well. It just works perfectly with their fresh baked bread and the sauce they use is legit.   Caribbean Jerk Chicken - my friend loved this one and got it several times. We even stopped on the way to parking garage just to handle the craving for the road. I didn't try it but he raved on and on about it and I plan on trying it next. Maybe the Anaheim location?   Their desserts are also pretty good. We got the red velvet cupcake and the brownie bites.   Check this spot out! Even if the line looks long don't be scared, it moves pretty quick and the workers were very friendly too. I wish they had more locations in So Cal.",

The lines to order a sandwich were extremely long, at least 15 deep, that I knew I wasn't at Subway.  i had a Full Montagu sandwich which was a turkey roast beef combo sandwich with swiss cheese. The bread was so good and the cheese to meat ratio was just right. If I had anything to compare this shop to, it would be a Quizno's in terms of the type of offerings but the sandwiches are just so much better.  The side pasta salad was premade in the cup and didn't compare to the sandwich in terms of taste.",

At first look, you might think it is just another Quiznos analog, or taste like any other toasted sub.  Quite the contrary.   They make all of their own bread, but unlike Subway who bakes their bread fresh,.. Earl of sandwich only bakes their bread partially.  The partially baked loaves are set aside, and wait for you to order.  Then the sandwich is assembled with high end, fresh and flavorful ingredients and sauces, and put through the chain oven.  It is at this time that the loaf of bread is fully, and freshly baked.  This leaves you with a perfectly light and fluffy, fresh baked bread that just can't be beat.  Its like bread straight out of the oven at home, and the corner stone of this amazing sandwich.     Having lived in vegas for several years as well as making frequent trips back, we have eaten just about everywhere.  Yes, you can get steak and eggs at midnight for 2.99,.. yes you can go to amazing all you can eat buffets,.. but if you want some serious gourmet flavor for around 5 bucks a person, this place can't be beat.       Between myself, my wife, and freinds and family we have brought here,.. we have collectively tried just about every sandwich on the menu.  The general consensus is, \" this is the best sandwich I have ever eaten\".     The portion is just about right.  Nothing is included, so if you want chips, drink or dessert, you may grab them on the way to check out.   They have a nice variety of fresh fruit, salad, chips and cookies.  Then the standard soda fountain, self serve.    It is now open 24 hours, and though we have tried to beat the crowds by coming in late, there always seems to be a bunch of people eating there.  They do now have vibrating coaster pagers now.  This is nice, because you can find a spot to sit and wait it out.  Turn around of your order depends on how crowded it is, but as a general timeframe say, 5 minutes in line, order, then maybe 5-6 minutes until the order is up.    I have never had a bad experience here. They haven't messed up an order, and I have yet to receive a sandwich that was anything short of amazing.  Good job guys!",

    "text": "After reading great reviews for this place, I decided to give this place a try since I was already staying at the Elara Hotel.    I noticed that there's always a line for this place - a good sign.  However, the line moves pretty fast, so don't get discouraged.  I waited maybe 3 minutes for my order of 2 sandwiches.  My mom got the Hawaiian BBQ and I got the Tuna Melt.  Flavor wise, both sandwiches were excellent.  Value wise, excellent for $6 each!  Service wise, very fast and efficient!  So why only 4 stars?  Because both my mom and I had suffered the \"MSG Chinese food syndrome\" after eating here.  We were both still extremely thirsty after drinking lots of water.  We also felt so sleepy that we had to take a nap.    If you don't mind lots of MSG in your food, this place is a great find!  It's cost effective and fills you up.",

The kids had pb&j, grilled cheese, and roasted turkey and Swiss which none of them seemed to enjoy as all of them were only half eaten. Most of the adults ordered the earls club sandwich which they all said tasted really good. I had a mediterranean chicken wrap which tastes very bland. I would recommend one of the hot sandwiches as apposed to the wraps. Also the loaded baked potatoe soup was delicious. Prices were great but the sandwich didn't come with any sides or drink. It was very very busy when we got there but somehow we managed to move three tables together for our party of 11 without any difficulty.",

I have tried over 5 different types of sandwiches at Earl's and they are all delicious. The best part is that they are all 5.99, which is great when everything else is Vegas is disgustingly overpriced. Another plus about Earl's is that they are open 24 hours, which means when you are done drinking and gambling for the night, you will definitely be able to enjoy these delicious sandwiches. Not to mention it is one of the best hangover cures. The line sometimes gets pretty long, but their service is very fast and there is no way you will be waiting too long for a sandwich. I would definitely recommend checking out Earl's when you are in Vegas for a delicious cheap eat!",

I had the BBQ and loved it.  The bread is sooo good.  I'm not a bread girl.  I don't eat bread.  But after enough drinks this past weekend - I was hungry and I wasn't about to set the bread aside on this one.  So worth it.  Crispy on the outside, warm and soft on the inside.  Hubby had the Montagu and was extremely satisfied.  We stopped in around 9 or 10 pm and there was no line.  We walked right up, ordered, and received our sandwiches within 10 minutes.  If it was even THAT long.  Its located toward the back of the casino at one of the ends of the Miracle Mile and has plenty of seating.  Worth a stop.  And definitely worth a repeat visit to try a different concoction on the menu.  It all sounds so tasty!",

The line here is always crazy long but it goes down pretty quickly and efficiently.  It is hidden by one of the entrances into Planet Hollywood (I always get so confused trying to look for it).  I recently found out there is a EOS in downtown Disneyland so I can grab a sandwich there when I'm in Socal and don't have to go all the way to Vegas to get one.  The service here is never a problem so I have no complaints.  A must stop when you're in Vegas or eating on a budget!",

Also the bread is soft and the meat is not overly flavored or salty.    Be prepare to wait a while for your order to be ready.  We had to wait about 30 minutes before we got our.  But while you wait you can walk around and take a look around or even play the slot machines because they give you this beeper device thing that will go off once your order is ready.",

The horse radish was a bit spicy, but that's just because I can't handle spicy food well. I also tried to veggie sandwich which tasted healthy but was satisfying as well. I thought that the bread would be hard but it was actually very soft. The chicken tortilla soup was with little corn kernels in it as well. This place is a lot cheaper than other places on the Strip and I would definitely come back again!",

    "text": "Well worth the wait.  This visit to Earl of Sandwich was two years in the making; this place was bookmarked 5/19/2013.  The first time I came to Vegas in July 2013, I did not get the chance to eat here (time flies when you're having fun, I think Janet Jackson said that once).  Nonetheless, I finally made the initial visit to Earl of Sandwich.  I remember it like it was yesterday: I was hungry, it was hot out, and I just brought a pair of tennis shoes (not important, but needed to be said).  I made my selection very simple and straight to the point, I wanted The Earl's Club (turkey, bacon, swiss, lettuce, tomato, and sauce).  I ordered the sandwich, and then I waited.  Now, the wait was not long at all, but you know how it is when you're stomach is frantically telling you to feed it; a couple of minutes then start feeling like an eternity.  Then, BAM, I had my sandwich.  A quick note before I continue, I did not have to suffer a long wait in line, probably because I came here during the morning hours (your experience might vary).  To save the excruciating details of each bite into this sandwich, it was great considering the value. Afterwards, I pondered the next sandwiches I wanted to try in the future.  Those sandwiches include: The Original 1762, Tuna Melt,  Ham & Swiss, and the Italian.  I'll definitely be back here when I touch down in Vegas.",

He's just gotten out of a 6 hour gambling streak on the strip and is fiending for a sando somewhere close (that he can still afford on his less than $10 slot machine cash out ticket).... where's he going to go? Earl of Sandwich.  PROS: - Some of the cheapest and most filling eats on the Strip. - It's about 385% better tasting than Subway, and around the same price. - It's located indoors in between an air conditioned casino and a huge mall, so there's lots to do around afterwards.  CONS: - The lines get super long at lunch time any day of the week. - Their salads aren't that awesome, but you really shouldn't be getting a salad at a place called \"Earl of Sandwich\".  Wait until they open a joint called \"Earl of Greens\".",

I was starving at the time, so any sort of food item seemed appealing to me right then, but I have to say, I was so disappointed.  I can't even remember what sandwich I got...it was that forgettable. The only thing good was the ice cold beer I had gotten to go with the sandwich (since it was over 100 degrees outside).",

I went here with my husband and parents while walking the strip. We got the club, montague, and jerk chicken and we shared all three. The club and montague were filled with meat and cheese and veggies, but the jerk chicken was a little on the skimpy side. I was a little disappointed in the size of the chicken sandwich... after one bite I found that what it lacked in size it more than made up for in flavor!! And the banana pallets were such a great addition. Personally. A sandwich is only as food as it's bread and this place had amazing bread! It can be difficult to find a table, there were 5 of us circling like vultures! Oh... And it's open 24 hours!! What's not to love?? Two thumbs way up!!",

Skip the 24 hour diners in your hotel, with the greasy fare and slow service. This counter style shop is super efficient, cheap, and gooooooood.   Stopped by hot and tired around lunch time, only to find a long line... I was tired and hungry, so I figured it'd be better to wait than venture back into the 100 degree heat for something else. Surprisingly, the line moved quickly. I also appreciate that they give you a buzzer when your food is ready so that there isn't a crowd waiting near the pick up counter. Food came quickly, also a big bonus. I got the club sandwich. The sandwich was hot and bread freshly toasted, the veggies were fresh, and the special \"sandwich sauce\" was tasty and they applied a nice amount (not too much to over power and soggy the sandwich, and enough so I could taste it).  Would highly recommend!!",

    "text": "Don't get me wrong, for food i would have rated this place 4 stars, but their SERVICE was awful which brought my rating down to 3 stars.  lets start with WHY: the service was AWFUL. For a fast food place they do NOT efficiently take advantage of the large staff they have on hand. There are 4 people at the register but only ONE person who is actually ON the register. The other 3 workers are just standing behind the cashier chatting. If there is a LONG line of customers waiting to order, the best thing to do is to open up your second cashier and double the orders. There are plenty of people working on making the sandwiches, its much better than having staff members bored and waiting around while there is a long line of customers. it just looks ridiculous.   The second time i came here the line was incredibly long and there was only ONE cashier (yet again) so i decided to call in my order instead. I skipped the long line to order n just paid at the register. The person calling out the orders for pick up had the WORST attitude. They kept making comments at me even though i was just patiently waiting. They were just being RUDE. Seriously miss you're working at a sandwich shop in las vegas, for probably minimum wage, please stop power tripping over when i can get my sandwich.   So SERVICE for this place is TERRIBLE. Workers are rude and the wait is long for NO real reason. Upper management should really consider retraining and restructuring their system. Because terrible service is never acceptable if your running a good sandwich shop. The least you can do is make sure your employees have good customer service.  ONTO the delicious sandwiches. I would highly recommend the Montagu sandwich. It was seriously the best thing on the menu i had. The sandwich is baked so the cheese is nice and melted. All the ingredients are fresh. I also had their Jerked Chicken sandwich, and it was very good. The grilled chicken was juicy and flavorful and the peppers had a good spicy kick! I also tried their Club sandwich and that was very delectable as well. Bacon was nice and crispy but not burnt. Just something about a nice hot sandwich really hits the spot. Their bread is freshly baked so you really get a good sandwich. THe price is very affordable. One sandwich averages about $5! not bad!!  honestly The Earl of Sandwich's customer service REALLY killed it for me. I loved the sandwiches but it would be a major hindering factor for me to come back. There are so many great restaurants in Vegas, why would i put myself thru so much crap from the staff members of the sandwich shop. Please keep in mind I came here twice and had a horrible experience with their customer service both times.   recap: 1) highly recommend calling in your order because there's usually a long wait 2) Montagu sandwich is amazing",

That being said, I'm not sure why our sandwiches looked NOTHING like the yelp pictures customers have posted. I ordered the Earl's Club and it was pathetically put together. 80% barely toasted bread. Fillings were flavorless. Turkey was gross and processed. Bacon was virtually non-existent. It's possible that this was once a great sandwich place, but I may have missed the boat. Stars are for service which was super friendly but the food here is WEAK and seriously overrated.",

So Hooked that I tried to go back the same night but was unable to because I didnt want to miss the tram that would take me back to my hotel room in Palazzo. :(  But I did get to go again at the end of our trip.. and guess what I got the same sandwich.  Now I got to try the Hawaiian which was tasty and delicious. I also tried the Caribbean Chicken or some other name.. and that was also good but my favorite by far was the Caprese, so much that I ordered it twice. The cheese tasted freshly cut, the basil was just right and tomato crisp inside a bun that was well pressed so it had that right crispy outside and the soft inside. The balsamic vinaigrette just made my mouth water for more. I wish I was back in vegas so I could walk to it and order another caprese sandwich. sigh. Earl of Sandwich please come to socal!  The lines can get long if you are here on peak time. However, it is open 24/7 so come later if you can! :-D",

    "text": "So any place with that many reviews and a great score demands a nod of interest. The wife and I have recently moved to Las Vegas from Northern California. We are on the hunt for local good food. As we have recently discovered, any resident or local tries to stay the hell away from the strip.  We had to run downtown today, and decided to grab a sandwich and watch the flocking tourist. As expected there was a decent line of approx. 15 people a head of us. We patient;y waited our turn and made our order. (Cuban, Holiday Turkey, and The full Mont.) We got out numbered pager, drinks, and headed into the packed dinning room for a table. We lucked out, grabbed a warm table that just lifted.    Less than ten min. pass and our sandwiches are ready. I open the Cuban first, warm, toasty and looked delicious. My wife had the Holiday Turkey that was just as good looking. The first bite for both of us was a religious experience, we put a lot of expectations into these sandwiches, and they did not fail to step up with a quality product. We shared all three and enjoyed each and every bite. My favorite was the Holiday Turkey that my wife ordered. It is that mid night sandwich you sneak into the kitchen on Thanksgiving night to make when the family is asleep. We were unable to find a flaw with any of our choices. Earl of Sandwich we are new fans.  So, hands down a great choice for lunch, dinner, midnight drunken snack to absorb the alcohol you have marinated yourself in all weekend.     Enjoy people!!!",

A lot of people would say that the buffets are what you need to hit up to satisfy them taste buds.  But nothing compares to the delicious, melt in your mouth, explosion of flavor you get from these sandwiches.  I went to Vegas for a week and didn't discover this spot until my second day.  As soon as I bit into my first sandwich, I said F**K THE BUFFETS, Earl's is where it's at!  The fact that this place is open 24 hours makes it even BETTER.  Nothings more satisfying than having one of these babies at 4 am when you're tired and drunk off your ass!    My friends and I stayed at Planet Hollywood, so access to the sandwiches was as convenient as can be.  Not that convenience is a factor when it comes to these sandwiches.  I would walk the WHOLE strip if I had to, just to get one in my stomach!    I tried EVERY SINGLE sandwich they had at least once, and the ones I recommend are: The Original, The Earl's Club, The Full Montagu, and my favorite, THE ALL AMERICAN!!!    The All American had to be one of the best sandwiches I've had in my life. Roasted turkey, buttermilk ranch, cranberries, sharp cheddar cheese, lettuce & Roma tomatoes.  The way all the flavors mix together when you take a bite is HEAVEN.  It's like your whole Thanksgiving dinner in one bite!    The bread they use is a perfect blend of crispy-toasty-fluffyness that melts in your mouth!  It Doesn't cut the roof of your mouth like other toasted sandwiches I've had, and that's a BIG factor towards enjoying a toasted sandwich!  If you want to learn more, peep this link for a description of each sandwich.  But for MAXIMUM satisfaction, try the ones I suggested!  <a href=\"/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.earlofsandwichusa.com%2Ffood%2Fsandwich%2F&s=fd0eee137b7b1a290b35d7155c3d21cf943b24c494b32c174dba7f7aaa85a79f\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">earlofsandwichusa.com/fo...</a>  Breakfast, Lunch, Dinner, Late Dinner, and Drunk Super Late Dinner/Super Early Breakfast are the best times to have one of these sandwiches!  My friends and I even bought some for the road trip home!  Good thing there isn't one in SoCal, cause I'd go broke eating at this place!  SUBWAY WILL NEVER BE THE SAME TO ME.  P.S.  Request for a side of ranch, cause as it is with all foods, the fattier the better!!!",

I stopped short of \"going all in\" and slapping down a 5 star because of one thing.  The soda fountain prices are crazy!  Hell $3 for a regular cup?

I've never heard of a wait that long for sandwiches before place, but it's totally worth it.  I usually get a full meal and order a soup, sandwich and drink. The price is pretty reasonable as well, seeing as how it's on the Strip.  I love their Tomato Bisque, and the Cannonballs! (Meatball) Sandwich.  They are both glorious in their own ways.   The ingredients they use in the sandwich are quality, and don't taste cheap at all.  The cheese is always melted perfectly and does that gooey stringy thing when you bite into the sandwich.

BUT, what I do remember was this place has AWESOME sandwiches.  I LOVE sandwiches and this place is one of the best ever, especially for the price you get!  Just go here, even if you just downed your whole life savings at the pleasure pit because those girls totally enticed you to gamble, go here and be happy.",

I got myself nice and liquored up for my first time eating at Earl's because I've heard about how good it was, and I wanted the first time to be phenomenal. It was. Melt in your mouth ooey goodness. The defining part of a sandwich is the bread and Earl's did not disappoint, it was warm, crisp, and fresh deliciousness. So much so, that I was craving it again the next morning  Maybe I was hungover? Or maybe, Earl's is just that awesome. It was just as amazing as it was liquored up. I think I need to put Earl's to the test, I need to try it at all hours of the day ;) to fully prove that Earl's sandwiches are the best in Vegas. :D",

I didn't really believe what I was seeing so my friends and I decided to try it.  I ordered the Earl's Club.  I took my first bite....I can't even explain how gosh darn good it was...the bread was warm, moist and soft.  Meat was heated to perfection and the cheese...cheesy goodness!  This place was SO GOOD that my friends and I came back to eat here one last time.  This time I ordered the Hawaiian BBQ.  MMmMM for tangyness!  A lot of chicken, bread, again AWESOME!, pineapple nomz!    Overall...if you're ever in Vegas...EAT AT EARLS!",

Top 3 reasons that this place gets 5 stars: 1) Open 24 hours. A necessity especially in a place like Vegas. 2) Tastes like a panini, but the bread is SOFT and doesn't rip up my mouth. 3) CHEAP! When you're losing money at the craps tables, it's a very comforting thought that you can at least afford one last delicious meal in Vegas.  The Earl's Club and the Full Montagu were both amazingly delicious. For a Vegas eatery, this place definitely deserves the crazy high rating.",

Well not really, but with the over priced hell that Vegas has become, this has one of the best price:value ratios here. It's a play on the name of the history of Sandwiches being produced to feed a royal in times past. It's also the name of one of the founders of the Planet Hollywood chain (I'll give you a clue; neither Stallone or Sandwich)  There's always a queue but it's pretty fast moving. They give you one of those discs which light up when your order is ready.   The sandwiches are variations on toasted ones with all varieites. My fave? The tuna melt. Absolute magic. (Have also had the Earl of montagu one which was beef, horseradish and cheese and was passable.)   THe food is great then and there but when I took one to munch later, it didn't work well cold.  Price is around $6 which is great for this area for an original taste outside of the usual fast food empires.  It is now open 24 hrs to feed the night elfs.",

It was a mediocre sandwich at best, not worthy of being wrapped in gold.  I tried the Italian and the lady got a turkey sandwich. Both were ok, but I think that Quiznos is better and that's not saying much. Maybe if I didn't have such high expectations for it, I might have liked it better but it let me down.  It got 3 stars because it's cheap food on the strip that's open late.",

My biggest issue with this place and my only True gripe is that they removed my favorite sandwich and every time I ask they tell me they have no clue why. For anyone who has had the Ultimate Grilled Cheese you will know why I am so upset that I knocked a full star off. I've been to this place at least 25-30 times and ever since they took this sandwich off the menu my heart has been bleeding for it to return.   Until this returns to the menu I will be forced to eat only semi-amazing sandwiches and cry in the fetal position in front of the cash register until security carts me off. You'd think I would be banned after doing this 5 times but I guess I have a forgettable face. BRING BACK THE ULTIMATE GRILLED CHEESE.",

The soups, especially the Tomato Soup, taste great and it doesn't hurt your pocketbook as much with it being only $2.99.  The yogurt parfaits ($3.99) are pretty good too, my favorite being blueberry.

My advise is get yourself a frozen drink from across the restaurant, and just wait. Even though the line was long, they cranked the orders out like a machine.   I got the Earl's Club (which is their take on a turkey club--pretty classic taste) and the Hawaiian BBQ (which is truly scrumptious). The bread is perfectly toasted. Best of all it's only $6.00 per sandwich...refreshing after the arm and a leg you have to pay in Vegas for everything. Plus, it's open late--perfect for a late night snack!",

We stayed at Aria so it was a bit of a walk to Planet Hollywood (most of thru the Crystals Mall Plaza) but it was totally worth it!   I had to get my favorite Cannonballs! and it was delicious. Meatballs were delicious, the sauce was sweet and flavorful, and the cheese was melted nicely on top. I also tried the Earl's Club, Italian, and their Tomato Soup. Everything was oh so yummy. Their ingredients are so fresh and you cannot beat their prices! The long line that is always present should be a strong indication of how amazing this place is.   NYC LOCATION OPEN UP ALREADY PLS!!!!!",

This time I listened to my exasperated friends and all of Yelp and ordered a hot tuna sandwich.  Cheesy, DELISH, filling, what else could you ask for? The tuna was so good-- it's a mix of cooked tuna and loads of swiss cheese. Not really any veggies, but hey, you're in Vegas, so splurge!  The bf had the original: roast beef, cheddar, and horseradish. I thought I wouldn't be a fan because of the horseradish, but there was only a hint of spice and as a whole it tasted amazing.  To top it off, despite the line, we didn't wait to long. And after ordering we were called up almost right away. Prices are also great for Vegas ($7/sandwich-- only took one to fill me up before the ride home).  The perfect fix before leaving Vegas. Earl of Sanwich you have redeemed yourself (seriously, friends don't let friends order a wrap)! I now understand the hype and I'll see you next year.",

And considering the prices of most food in Vegas, this is the best way to get a good meal for 2 for under $20.  This joint is always busy, but the assembly line moves reasonably fast and worth the wait!   If you've never had an Earl of Sandwich EVER.... you've been missing out! My boyfriend had never tried it before, and even he agrees it's the best sandwich he's ever tasted. Now if only this existed in Canada... I would be a regular, and extremely obese.  My absolute favourite: Full Montagu - everything good jam packed into a sandwich. All the sandwiches are just as good though, including The Original 1762 and The Earl's Club. Like that there's also a variety of options for salads and snacks, though it's the sandwich that sets it apart.",

Maybe that's why I wasn't really impressed with it. I mean, don't get me wrong... the sandwiches are pretty good. The bread, as everyone else has said, is warm with a crispy outside. There is a long line, but it moves fast and the food is cheap.   I tried two different sandwiches and a wrap with my friends. The Full Montagu (roasted Beef, turkey, swiss & sharp cheddar, lettuce, tomatoes & the Earl's mustard sauce) was pretty good. There wasn't really anything in it to make me say \"WOW!\". lol The same goes for the Earl's Club (turkey, smoked bacon, swiss, lettuce, tomatoes, and Earl's sandwich Sauce). As you can see the sandwich ingredients are not anything special.   Get good bread, a good toaster oven, and a few sandwich stuffers and you have Earl's!   Quick Tips:   1. Come hung over and hungry! It would probably taste amazing!   2. Expect a line. It's long but moves fast.   Would I come again? Sure.",

Filling enough, but not so much that you feel stuffed.  Ambiance is...similar to any fast food restaurant. (Loud and sometimes not as clean as you'd like.) However, you have to kind of temper your expectation since a fast food experience isn't going to be some 4-star restaurant.  Good food, reasonable price (even on the strip) and it was made quickly and efficiently. I'll definitely go again.",

Only a 10 minute walk or if I'm desperate, a 5 minute fast-walk dodging innocent pedestrians. Earl's is my go to meal in Vegas. You cant beat the price and quality. I've done many a vegas trips surviving off only Earl's. A typical schedule consist of - Arrive in Vegas, grab Earl's for dinner. Eat half - take a Tabasco for the road. Go clubbing. Come home starving - finish the other half that night or the next morning. Wake up. Day Club. Earl's. Really what more do you need? Order the Caprese Sandwhich - no meat but still incredibly filling and flavorful. The soups are great too if your too exhausted to conquer a sandwhich first. Great cold, hot, or microwaved the next day!",

The line moves very fast about 10 minutes max, so don't be scared it it seems very long.  The wait for the sandwiches was about 7 minutes.   We ordered the Italian & the Chipotle Chicken.  The Chipotle Chicken was very savory, especially with the fresh avocado.  I love any Italian style sandwiches, and my sandwich was delicious.  The bread was sooo buttery and crispy and moist, all at the same time.   I just don't think the price was worth $6.50 for sandwich, the sandwich was only 6 inches long... that's' a very small size, I could probably have had 2 sandiches to feel completely full. Plus they are expanding to the OC as well, where I would definitely not pay $6.50 for a sandwich,since there are so many other good places around.     Plus for being open 24/7 though !!!",

My veggie sandwich was good but the sauce made it messy and it had way too much salt. I think it was in the pesto sauce.

All three of us ate the entire sandwich and were fully satisfied. We even went again and got sandwiches a few days later. It's quick & pretty average priced, I believe it was about $7 a sandwich.

Most of them are $6.50, and they're the perfect size.  They wont stuff you for sure, but will certainly hold you over.  Every Vegas trip, I literally find excuses to walk by Planet Hollywood so that I can grab a sandwich really quick and eat while I walk.  Usually I'll have about 3 every Vegas trip.

They even left a \"break\" in the line to give space for the people seated at the table to the left of the order takers on the casino floor.  The order taker was super rude when he told everyone to \"FORM THE LINE THE OTHER WAY!!\" And people formed the line back into the narrow aisle.    While paying for the food at the cashier the two morons at the registers decided to hold up everyone unnecessarily by having non-work related chat amongst each other and laughing while ringing people up.  One of them actually had the change in her hand but didn't hand it to the couple ahead of us until after the guy finished his punchline and both laughed before she handed the change and receipt to the customer.  I think she held the change for 10 seconds.  The transaction probably took 1/2 minute too long... Imagine you're the 50th person and each transaction were hampered by the BS'ing of the cashier???  Thanks for wasting our valuable time.  Well, we were unfortunate to have sat at a table next to the narrow aisle when the line started to get long again, and we had asses in our faces when people in line had to scoot into us to make way for people passing by.  Dumb minimum wage order taker didn't put much thought into why people were using common sense to form the line in the other direction.  Chicken avocado sandwich was okay but the chicken noodle soup tasted salty.  We used to come multiple times during our Vegas trips, but we will NEVER come back due to the rude and inconsiderate staff, even if it's not busy.  There's way too many options in Vegas so it's worth our time dealing with idiots to buy a damn sandwich.",

The sandwich was made nice and hot, with just the right proportions of meat and horseradish.  The hoagie was crunchy on the outside and just right in the middle.  The price ain't too bad either.  So why did I knock off one star? Most of the tables were dirty with trash on them.  Obviously they hadn't been cleaned since the previous patrons used them and I had a hard time finding a clean table to sit at.  This wasn't a busy time either.  While I ate, someone finally started to go around and clean the tables.  Despite this slight inconvenience, I'd certainly easy here again.",

My friends and I stop by Planet Hollywood at least once every time we're in Vegas just for Earls.  There's usually a line going all the way into to the mall, but don't fear.. It goes by pretty fast. Their service is pretty speedy and they can probably serve you that golden brick within 20 minutes if you're standing at the mall walkway. Expect it to be crowded, college students swarm around this place like bees on honey.   Tips: If you like Thanksgiving dinners, get the Holiday Turkey, that thing makes you feel like it's November.   Also, the best Fat Tuesdays are at Planet Hollywood, so why the heck not double fist it with a gold brick?  Overall: You get bang for your buck and there's really no bad time for a sandwich.",

Awesome sandwiches, and at only $6.00 each, they are a steal for being on the strip in Planet Hollywood. I complain a lot when sandwich places jip you with too much bread, but here, the bread was the best part! It's a crispy, almost English muffin-type bread that's toasted, warm, and delicious. They do toasted sandwiches but Quizno's would be the mere fly on the stick compared to Earls. I had the Full Montagu sandwich and it was just off the chain! I honestly haven't had a sandwich that good in awhile. This place is a steal compared to some of the other high-priced places in Planet Hollywood and surrounding it. I will definitely be going back next time i'm in Vegas again. I hope they get a franchise going here in Texas!",

The decor of the restaurant makes it feel like you're at Corner Bakery.  But when it comes to the sandwich, this one definitely stands out.  The roll they use has a rich buttery taste and the dough easily flakes off when you take a bite.  It is the perfect combination of taste and texture.  The tuna itself was great tasting and wasn't runny like some other sandwiches I've had.  The people are friendly and there's plenty of seating, but if you get there during peak hours, lines build up and there'll be a wait.  Trust me, it's worth the wait.",

I ordered \"The Full Montagu\" and it was a hot roast beef sandwich with turkey, swiss and cheddar cheese, lettuce, and the infamous \"Earl's mustard sauce.\" I opted out for the tomatoes because I feel that tomatoes can tend to overpower my sandwich with it's juiciness at times...too much juice can make the sandwich loose;) Anyhoo, I also tried the \"Earl's grey lemonade\" and it was pretty good, not too sweet. Most people might say that the best part of a sandwich is the meat or the sauce, but I believe that it was the \"Earl's artisan bread\" that did it for me. It was sturdy enough to hold the meat and toppings in nicely, yet soft enough to keep from getting soggy. So the next time you are in Vegas and don't want to do the usual buffet, then get yourself a sandwich at \"Earl of Sandwich!\"",

I bought the boyfriend a Thanksgiving sandwich, with the recommendation of a friend, who said it was \"Thanksgiving in your mouth.\" Unfortunately, the boyfriend didn't like cranberry in his sandwich so he thought this place was just okay. Everyone else love loved it though; one of our friends wanted to eat it for every meal! The service was FAST and the sandwiches are CHEAP, so I would definitely recommend this place. Even if you're sober and in Vegas, this is really tasty! It was pretty crowded, even though we went in the afternoon (after lunch rush).

My boyfriend got the Hawaiian BBQ sandwich - tasted just like a Hawaiian pizza, reallyyy yummy!  I got the Chicken Cesar wrap - it was pretty decent. The salad inside was good, but the bread was more of a flatbread than a wrap. In fact, it wasn't even rolled up - just kind of folded together like a taco. Next time I'll either get it as a salad or stick to the famous sandwiches!",

That being said, the Italian was awesome. Hot sammie, made fresh to order, soft bread, great flavors etc. The only criticism I can muster is that the last few bites felt like work, the bread is a little too chewy.",

I've had it in the early hours of the morning, and twice in the afternoon. All three of those times, the quality of food and service never changed. Working in the food industry myself, that's something really worth noticing.   The tomato soup is a must try! I don't know if its the crouton goodness or the creaminess of the soup but it was so good! It tasted like heaven in a bowl! Definitely a must try!   The full montagu wasn't as great as I expected it would be. It was a little on the bland side but the Chicken Chipotle Avocado was delicious. It was just the right amount of spice.   Earl's is definitely a must try when you're visiting Vegas!",

I think that if they opened one of these in SLC, I'd be here at least once a week. I got the chicken caesar wrap with chicken noodle soup. The soup was good but pretty standard issue, but the sandwich...oh my. I don't know what they put in that dressing, but it was like crack. My boyfriend got the club and agreed with me on the freshness and tastiness of this place.   And the price isn't half bad. It won't break the bank like a lot of Vegas food joints.

    "text": "Most Vegas food on the go is mediocre at best and likely overpriced. So I must say, I was extremely delighted & surprised to dine here at Earl of Sandwich. Now me and some friends came here after a long night of drinking and a 3-hr heater on a craps table. With the afterparty drinks being on the house, we were still pretty tossed, and this sandwich hit the spot. Sure, it was 9am and we were mad drunk while other tourist families were giving us the staredown, but I do not apologize! After some sleep, I was thinking about killing the world to cure my hangover, and then I started to think about real things like, \"was that sandwich really that bomb? or were u really that wasted?\" To get to the bottom of it all, I came back...and it really is just that good.  The place is fast and what value! $5.95 flat rate the whole way through! I ordered \"the Earl's Club\" (Roasted Turkey, Smoked Bacon, Swiss Cheese, Lettuce, Roma Tomato & Sandwich Sauce) and \"the Original 1762\" (Freshly Roasted Beef, Cheddar Cheese & Creamy Horseradish Sauce)--both scrumptious! The toasted Panini and hot ingredients make this. My biggest complaint is that they could've been bigger--I feel like I could easily eat two of them in one sitting but I'm a fatass personally. I feel like most chicks would be satisfied with one of Earl's \"Cannonballs!\" [sorry, cheesy bad taste joke ;] But seriously, my other friends recommend that sandwich and \"the Italian\". Definitely coming back the next time I'm at Planet Hollywood. I would suggest this to anyone in the area looking for a quick bite at a reasonable price.",

My first sandwhich was awesome and amazing and I swore to myself that I'd eat here for rest of my trip. After my second sandwhich on the next day, I pretty had enough of this place... the food is great but it isn't healthy. I couldn't continue eating here for rest of my trip.  Overall, I'd definitely recommend to those who haven't tried this place out. It's good, satisfies your hunger and it's affordable!

But that's all I found enjoyable.  We tried:  BLT - was good but nothing above average.  Chipotle chicken avocado sandwich - I was so excited to try this but was hugely disappointed.  There wasn't much of a chipotle taste & there wasn't enough chicken (just enough right in the middle where sliced in half but nothing elsewhere in the sandwich). Basically melted cheese, hard avocado slices (not fully ripe) & pieces of chicken here & there. Not impressed at all.  Spicy tuna wrap - ummm where was the spice? Not even a hint of spice. The tuna mixture was watery & tuna was very pasty/dry. There were banana peppers & olives but that just made the wrap really tangy & vinegar tasting.   If you're really hungry in vegas & everything's closed then this may do the trick. Otherwise don't waste your time. Still confused by the hype & line up for this place...",

I remember always getting the Chipotle Chicken sandwich (why change it up when it doesn't do you wrong). I think I got it because it said avocado in the sandwich description and I love avocado! The soups on the menu looked pretty good as well.   As for the prices, this is a cheap spot to get a quick bite if you're saving up your money for the clubs or lost your money from gambling. Regardless Earl of Sandwich has your back on your hunger pangs and money saving mindset.

    "text": "The thing about food places that are open really late or 24 hours is that half of their customers are drunks feeding their drunchies (drunk munchies) or hungover. The problem with people eating food when they're drunk or hungover is that taste buds are heightened so food tastes so much better than it would if you were sober or not drinking the night before. That being said I thought my sandwich was amazing. Full disclosure: I was drunk when I ate it. Who knows what I would have thought if I ate it while sober.  I split the chicken chipotle avocado with a friend because there's an Earl of Sandwich close to home in Anaheim and I've seen those gold bricks sandwiches on Instagram posts which looked larger than life. I regret that decision and wish I'd gotten my own sandwich because I devoured that half sandwich. We got chipotle sauce on the side because I put sauce only if the sandwich is bland. Surprise surprise it wasn't bland and I ended up not using any of the chipotle sauce at all. Bacon was crunchy and perfect. The mac and cheese was amazing. My drunk self decided to put the mac and cheese in the sandwich and it was a flavor explosion.  The line goes right out of the store and next to gambling tables. This line moves slowly because on a summer Saturday night/Sunday morning at 3 AM there was only one cashier. If you're an attractive female coming straight from the club in a dress and heels, the gamblers at the table will look and stare at you to the point that it would make even an intoxicated person uncomfortable. Best to look away and ignore them. You've been warned.",

He encouraged us to check it out with him for lunch one day.    I ordered the Original 1762.  This is a hot roast beef sandwich with cheddar and horseradish sauce.  It was pretty good.  I wish they had a bit more horseradish sauce on the sandwich.  I also got a side of tomato soup and pasta salad.  Both were your average run of the mill items you'd find at a sandwich spot.  This is a great place to grab food if you are looking for a cheap meal on the Strip.  3 stars for food.  Extra star for price.",

I've been to Earl many times mostly the Downtown Disney location in Anaheim every time it's always been quite good and hit the spot!  My favorite sandwich they have here is the chipotle chicken avocado it's packed with flavor pieces of avo as well as a thick savory mildly spicy sauce and just all around good!  They have a few soups as well of these I chose the broccoli cheddar it was flavorful with a few chunks of broccoli inside.  This location is right on the strip and easy access from Planet Hollywood Casino it's open 24 hours and they have breakfast too!  The line moved decently fast and our food was super good you know ill hit this up again when I'm in Vegas or the other one that's closer to home!",

My friends and I trekked out to the Planet Hollywood hotel where Earl of Sandwich is located.  I ordered my customary \"The Original 1762\" sandwich (roast beef, cheddar, horseradish).  I also ordered a tomato soup (another obsession of mine), which I hadn't ordered before from Earl.  I LOVED my meal!    This restaurant has tons of seating (and gets quite packed). Service is great and they're apparently open 24/7!!! Win, win, and win.    Earl of Sandwich, you've done it again!  I'm sooo in love with this place. Is there ever going to be an Earl of Sandwich location that I'm not head over heels for?? Hopefully not!  Will visit this and other locations I come across whenever possible!",

But, like many past, future and present patrons of this great institution; we can't help but rave about Earls.   Not only is it affordable, but I can't think of a better meal than Earls. And all for under $10.   The line during the 'day' is managable however, this place gets super packed late into the evening when many are stumbling out of the clubs and back to their hotels.   My favorite sandwiches are their Original; because you can't argue with a simple sandwich that has all the essentials; roast beef, horseradish sauce and cheese. The other popular and equally delicious sandwich is their Montague; which has roast beef, turkey, lettuce and tomatoes. But honestly my favorite part of the entire sandwich are the crispy, buttery bread. Each bite is crunchy and has the perfect ratio of carbs to everything else.   When all else fails in Las Vegas, Earl's do not.",

I got the italian and it tasted like shit and I threw it away. The second time I had it was because I was  starving and alone because everyone else ate without me while I slept (the fuckers) SO i decided to mosey down the elevator and stumble over to mr. Earl. Got the original and now I cannot stray. Extra Dijon a pepsi and that shit is gone.  Yum crispy tenderness. Roast beef is so melt in mouth good I wonder if they have cooked it long enough.  THe third time i went there i got the original with pasta salad and a pepsi. I literally had to be rolled out of there. SO much food, so good.   I will come back another day. ANother time my friend. They also have breakfast sandwiches. But its like 7am  to 11am . Who the eff wakes up before 11 in vegas, unless you just stay up all night, it is earl's so it might just be worth it.",

My party loved it so much we came back the very next day as our last meal in Vegas.  Location/parking: Located inside the Planet Hollywood Casino right across from the sports bar.  Seating/wait: Quick moving line if you want to order. Better to send someone from your party to find a table during busy times.  Service: Order over the counter. Sit and enjoy!  Food: -Tomato soup with croutons (I asked for it on the side). This is hands down my favorite tomato soup every. EWW!!! Tomato soup. No really. I usually don't order tomato soup but I've ordered this every time I've been here. I suggest asking for croutons on the side. Otherwise, they come included in the soup and it may be soggy by the time you find a spot to sit. -Potato salad cup from fridge: it's a 2 star. It's as if you got potato salad from a super market. -Sugar cookie: pretty good/ok. -Brownie creme (looks like oreo whoopee): I thought it was ok. -The Earl's club sandwich: Amazing! Club sandwiches are usually all the same but it very god here. -Caribbean Jerk Chick Sandwich: delicious. Can't remember what the other 2 sandwiches were but all delicious.  This place is so good. \"Earl\" of sandwiches is quite demeaning. It should be at least a Duke of Sandwiches.",

I love the BREAD they use for their hot sandwiches!   First , we tried  the classic\" Original 1762\" which is roast beef sandwich and the \"Canon Balls\" which is  meat balls. Both are  Perfect!  I had the chicken soup , it was a very cold night... you can pass on the soup. It's bland.  Next day, we tried the Montague , which is good , had roast beef & turkey and the Hawaiian sandwich ...I did not care for.  We will be back when we go back to Vegas....

Anyone can make a mean sandwich, but this place uses the cream of the crop bread. Buttery toasted to perfection. Texture crispy, soft on the inside. If there was a trophy for bread, they would receive a golden wheat flour stem. I think good bread and sauce makes a good sandwich, and Earl delivers. It's a simple and humble little sandwich shop with a nice seating area. I had the tuna melt sandwich- I am a tuna fan. No lies, one of the many best tuna sandwiches I've tried.

We ended up making it our nightly routine for the weekend - go out to the club, drink our faces off, go back to the hotel, GET A SANDWICH! Made my night every night. Over the course of the weekend we also had the soup, brownies, and chicken caesar salad. Everything was hot, fresh, and made quickly. It was super busy every time we went (including the first night at 4:30AM), but our food came out pretty quickly and we never left hungry. Not to mention the price was extremely good for what you get! On our way home we all commented on how we wished they had this place in Calgary! Until next time Earl...",

    "text": "Earl Of Sandwich, seriously the best sandwich I have ever had. I seriously wish I had like 4 stomachs so I can try 4 sandwiches in one seating. I think I speak for my girlfriend that this is seriously the best sandwiches.  Earl Of Sandwich is located in Planet Hollywood, best way to get here is pretty much enter in through the mall, with the entrance nearest pinks hot dogs. The line can get long here, but the service is pretty fast, and the fact that they supply you with those little thingy-ma-jiggy's that blinks red whenever your sandwich is ready to be picked up. I do love that they have a refill area for your soft drinks, it was a huge help for my thirsty self!  They actually have a large seating area, and also a wide variety of chips and dessert bites. Seriously though any of the sandwiches they offer are $5.99, and even though I only tried two of their sandwiches, I know that the others are just as bomb!  I had the Hawaiian sandwich, and oh my goodness. I remember first taking my bite into that sandwich, my eyes instantly closed and enjoyed each flavor. From the juice and sweetness from the pineapple, to the gooey but delicious cheese, the tender and salty taste from the ham, and to top it all off the crunch from the bread, its just a heavenly bite!  My girlfriend got the club sandwich, and seeing her reaction when she first bit into the sandwich, it was seriously a mirror image of myself but of her of course. Instead of Whoa which would come out of my mouth, my girlfriend yelled out BOMB! When I got to take my share of her sandwich, I dont blame her. The sandwich had many different textures from the crunch from the sandwich and the bacon, and also different flavors, salt from the bacon, the zing from the mustard it was simply amazing!   Overall I plan on coming to Earl of Sandwich whenever I come to Vegas, it is a must! I cannot wait to try all the other sandwiches, because seriously being so far away and having my mouth water, im getting all jumpy just wanting to have some right now!  - Ssp",

Very tasty!   The Earl's Club- loved it!! It wasnt anything special..just your usual turkey sandwich..BUT it was YUMMY!   ALL of the bread tasted delicious and was toasted to PERFECTION.

Did you know that the sandwich was named after a man who was the Earl of Sandwich? Wikipedia says:   It was named after John Montagu, 4th Earl of Sandwich, an 18th-century English aristocrat... It is said that he ordered his valet to bring him meat tucked between two pieces of bread... It is said that Lord Sandwich was fond of this form of food because it allowed him to continue playing cards, particularly cribbage, while eating without getting his cards greasy from eating meat with his bare hands.  If Wikipedia said it, it must be True.  Caribbean Jerk Chicken is absolutely splendid, though you really can't go wrong with anything on the menu. Bread is freshly made and toasted, meat is meaty and plentiful, and sauces and other sandwich toppings perfectly complement the bread and meat to form the perfect sandwich.  My mission is to eat every single sandwich on the menu.",

The hours at this location are amazing they're open 24 HOURS A DAY!  The sandwiches are hot and they definitely live up to the hype. Located in Planet Hollywood it has that bistro kinda vibe to it. My all-time favorites are the Hawaiian BBQ and The Full Montagu. After ordering it takes about less than 10 minutes to your food which is definately worth the wait.  I highly reccomend those who are visiting vegas to give this a shot. You wont regret it !",

Nothing earth shattering or groundbreaking  Earl of Sandwich reminds me of Corner Bakery meets Subway or Jersey Mikes or Quizno's ( you get the idea) .  They have an ample array of sammie offerings and the somewhat daunting line is a testament to this particular locations popularity. The line rivals In n Out except it's just the humans sans cars.   They offer soups, salads, and of course Sandwiches and  wraps. Count people watching as an entertaining distraction while you are waiting for your order to be filled.  It seems many a hangover victim are either slumped over in their chairs or recounting their past evenings exploits while waiting in line.  Once you get past the line and the wait the actual sandwich's are reasonably priced and filling enough to tide you over until your next meal. I have been here a few times and I like the convenience of ordering the food to go, especially if you are staying at Planet Hollywood.   It doesn't hurt they are open 24 hours which is surprisingly hard to find even in Vegas.  The sandwiches are filling and satisfying if not a bit heavy on the bread. Here is the  Chipotle Chicken with  Avocado Grilled chicken, bacon, cheddar, avocado, lettuce & chipotle sauce. I have ordered this several times and but for the 1/2 wait this one usually hits the spot. .   <a href=\"http://www.yelp.com/user_local_photos?userid=Fy71pENHo8QeE39MO55ZDw&select=iH-IwkAfh0gtGqFF23fCjw\">yelp.com/user_local_phot...</a>  I am not sure if you can call ahead and place a phone order but that might be a way to avoid the longish wait. All in all it is a satisfying if not all that unique place to get a decent sub-style sandwich.  I will eat there avian when I am at PH but doubt I would go out of my way to grab a bite at Earl of Sandwich.",

The holiday turkey sandwich has all the major components of Thanksgiving in 1 sandwich: turkey, stuffing, and cranberry jelly. That sounds amazing right? I know, that's why I had to see what it was like. When I took a bite, it was underwhelming and all the flavors melded into one bland mass.  The chipotle chicken avocado was slightly more flavorful than the holiday turkey. I enjoyed the fresh avocado. The $6.99 per sandwich, is comparable to Subway prices. The sandwiches are of course higher quality than Subway , but they are not amazing either. These are simple, decent sandwiches.",

The staff are always friendly and fast.    The price is pretty good too. The sandwiches are roughly $8 USD.  So it's good when you just want to eat something good, fast and cheap.

When all of the other restaurants are serving overpriced food, Earl of Sandwich is the place to get affordable AND delicious food, at any time of the day.  Earl is located near the back of Planet Hollywood; entering near BurGR, walk straight back through the casino area and you'll reach it. There will likely be a line during meal times, but the food is so worth the wait!  I've tried four sandwiches here: the Full Montagu, Earl's Club, All American, and Chicken Chipotle Avocado. All of the sandwiches were absolutely delicious and really filling! Toasted bread, tender meat, creamy sauces.... Yum. My favorite was the All American - the sweet and tangy cranberry sauce adds a whole other dimension to it.  And it's ONLY $6.49 A SANDWICH! One of the best deals on the Strip.  I tried the butternut squash soup as well, which was also yummy. Creamy but not too heavy. For drinks, I got the Earl Grey Lemonade, which turned out to be not that great... Tasted like watery lemonade with some earl grey tea mixed in. The sandwiches made it all better though. :)",

When I stayed at Planet Hollywood in 2011, we came here for quick breakfast sandwiches and coffee so we could refuel ourselves for the Strip. Their lunch sandwiches are also super good, get the soup and a bag of Salt and Vinegar chips, you're good to go!   Because every meal in Vegas doesn't need to be expensive, require a reservation months in advance or have a 2 hour wait to get in. I continue to come to this place even when we are not staying at the Planet, it's that delicious.  One day I spent too much time at the Aria spa, I actually came back to my room with some major shakes. Finally figured out it was due to low blood sugar and not having eaten anything since the Buffet for breakfast. First world problems! Absolutely. BUT. Earl of Sandwich to the rescue! I marched right over, got in line and got myself a Club sammich, like a crazed diabetic on a mission. Who knew Spa'ing could actually be considered a sport in Las Vegas and could be so taxing on the system. I felt like a noodle, but after eating lunch I was well enough to continue on with more Vegas adventuring.  What I like about this place is it's cheap, it's quick, it's convenient, it's open 24/7, it's sort of close to Starbucks, and it's on the outskirts of the casino so you don't have to walk a million miles before surrendering to sandwich simplicity. Once you're done eating, you can grab a Fat Tuesday in the Miracle Mile Shops. What's not to love?",

    "text": "Earl of Sandwich Overall  3 Stars  Gold, Silver, Bronze medal - Roasted Beef Sandwich  The first time I heard of Earl of Sandwich was when one of my friends was raving about a new sandwich place.  Its so good, blah blah blah.  I was excited to try it.  I first saw Earl of Sandwich at Downtown Disney, but the line was EXTREMELY long.  Like a 25 minute wait at least. 25 minute wait for a sandwich shop?  WOW, now I got even more interested.  I made my way to the Planet Hollywood in Vegas just to try the Earl of Sandwich.  Conclusion........ I am not impressed at all.  I tried 3 different hot sandwiches. The best out of the 3 was the roasted beef with the horseradish sauce.  It was hot and not too shabby, but definitely not 5 stars.  This located was EXTREMELY dirty too.  Unlike all the clean In n Outs you visit, the Earl of Sandwich here had trash all over the floor.    I am not sure if Earl of Sandwich was over hyped or this location was just bad, but I am not impressed at all.  There are sooo many good things to eat in Vegas, but I will not be adding Earl of Sandwich to my Vegas eats list.  HAPPY SANDWICHING!",

If you're low on money or you're just hAngry, satisfy your cravings at Earl's! It's a great option for a quick bite and to get some carbs and nutrients before taking on another night/or even day!  Never disappointed with my sandwiches and after eating every last bit of it, always tempted to order another because bread is awesome and adding meats, cheeses, and veggies just makes it even better.  Overall? Affordable, quick, casual, & delicious - Hence the four stars because if you're not down to buffet with the rest of them, this is one of your best options!",

When I saw the store front, I thought how good can a sandwich made by a chain restaurant be this hyped up. We decided to order two hot sandwiches and potato salad to go and eat it at the airport.   I ordered the Pastrami Reuben with pastrami, swiss cheese, sauerkraut, and sandwich sauce. My boyfriend order the Chipotle Chicken Avocado with grilled chicken, bacon, cheddar, avocado, lettuce and chipotle sauce. We had half of each other's sandwiches so we can taste it. Boy, it was soooo good I wanted more after I finished each half! It was like just enough to make you wanting more. Ugh, such a tease. I wish the sandwiches were bigger because I was still hungry. The pastrami tasted like it was made in house. Yummy!   Grab some sandwiches for the road. It's okay to eat two because they're small. Hehe! Next time I come back, I'm gonna order the The Full Montagu!",

Full Montagu ~ Fiance said the sandwich was good but the roast beef in it was the best he's had! He must have loved it because he devoured it before I could even try it!  Chinese Chicken Salad ~ Don't waste your money or appetite on it, get a sandwich instead or the Chicken Caesar. The dressing was too tart and tangy and the toppings were flavorless.  Hawaiian BBQ Chicken ~ Think of the best BBQ Chicken pizza you've ever had put it in a sandwich and add some fresh pineapple...delicious!  Chicken Caesar ~ Best chicken I've had in a salad, super moist, and very flavorful. Everything about the salad was good but the chicken made it memorable!  4 stars and a BONUS star for being so affordable! I loved Earl of Sandwich and wish there was one near me. Will definitely be making a pit stop here next Vegas trip!",

    "text": "I had heard a lot of hype about Earl of Sandwich and while the sandwiches here are pretty good its hardly a mindblower.    On the positive side, the bread is super fresh, the ingredients pretty tasty, service is quick and the price is affordable.  On the negative side, the sandwiches are a touch on the small side and service was kinda painful.  The GF and I came here for lunch, specifically to try Earl of Sandwich.  She ordered the Caribbean Jerk Chick and I had the Chipotle Chicken with Avacado and Chicken.  My sandwich was pretty good.  As I said above the bread may have been the best part.  Ingredient-wise you can see they use the same chicken across all their sandwiches and just dress the differently.  The chipotle dressing was nice and added a lot of flavor and the bacon and avocado where lacking a bit and didn't really punch through as much as I hopped.  The Caribbean Jerk Chicken came out without any dressing so my GF had to get another, upon the second try it was better.  It didn't really have as much flavor as I was expecting.  Again, it was a solid, even a good sandwich...it just could have been more.  Service was kind of wonky.  You order and one register then pay at another down the line.  The cashier at the end disappears to refill some napkins and disappears for almost 5 minutes.  A line quickly formers behind us and the food orders come in before people could pay.  The ladies running the sandwiches looked dumbfounded because they didn't know what to do.  Finally the cashier comes back, but it was still rather annoying.  I do want to give Earl of Sandwich another try down the road, particularly the one near disneyland.  While it wasn't everything I was expecting, the sandwiches were still of a good quality and an easy pick over Subway, Quiznos, Togos or any other fast food sandwich shop.",

    "text": "I was really excited to try Earl of Sandwich, since everyone has been talking about how delicious it is and how it's a must esp. when you're drunk, lol.  LOCATION -------------------------  My friends and I went here because it is conveniently located in the Miracle Mile Shop which is connected to our hotel in Elara! It seems, that this location can get incredibly busy, but their workers are pretty fast with taking orders & prepping the sandwich. They have a system that works since we didn't have to wait so long for our foods! OH, and I guess they are open 24 hours!  FOOD -------------------------  My best friend and I had to try the Caribbean Jerk Chicken since it stood out to us the most and.... well she hasn't had \"jerk chicken\" before!  I'd say this place is pretty cheap compared to other places on the strip! Me being a newbie expected it to be some big sandwich, but it's actually small, but good. It isn't the greatest or a five star sandwich in my opinion but it was good for the price and it's something that will fill you up if you are looking for a quick meal!  SERVICE -------------------------  I did mention their fast service here above which I thought was great! The cashier during our visit had mistakenly entered my friend's order,... which resulted to one of the managers yelling at him in front of us... *AWKWARD*. We all thought the yelling was unnecessary especially in front of customers. I didn't think the manager at that time responds well to pressure and the how busy they got.  Would I return? Absolutely! I wanna try their other sandwiches, and will definitely go for the ones my friends had recommended next time!",

    "text": "I have heard so many good things about this place and finally had a chance to come here recently. Overall, its pretty good and I know I will want to come back every so often.   First of all, the prices are very reasonable. All of their sandwiches, salads and wraps are priced at either $5.99 or $6.49. Don't be intimidated if you see a long line. The second time I came here, the line was so long that I thought for sure it would take me at least 30 minutes to get to the register and order. But that wasn't the case because the employees did a good job at keeping the line moving.   The food didn't quite blow me away, but it was still pretty good. Definitely better than Subway, Quiznos, etc. I have tried the Earl's Club and the Full Montagu. I felt that they were stingy with the turkey in the Club. I had maybe 2 thin slices in my sandwich. Unfortunately, you don't have a choice for your bread. It would be nice to have other options like wheat or cheese. But, the white bread was good enough - fresh and crispy on the outside. The chocolate chip cookie and brownie cream sandwich were tasty as well. Apparently the brownies here are made from Ghirardelli Chocolate!   I usually take my order to go since all the tables are always occupied. Just an FYI - if you sign up for their eClub, you get a free sandwich on your birthday!",

    "text": "Decided to head down to the strip and deal with the crowds. Luckily it wasn't too crazy and the line moved pretty quickly. The wife and I decided to order 3 sandwiches to share. All 3 were really great sandwiches...the bread is amazing and I thought they portioned everything just right. It's not hard to eat a sandwich and a half but for food on the strip, the pricing is on point.   The Full Montagu - I believe this is one of their staple sandwiches and that's for good reason. The turkey and roast beef are both tender and on their own, have great flavor. This sandwich came out with the perfect temp and both cheeses (aged swiss/sharp cheddar) were melted perfectly. They also add a killer mustard sauce which just made it even better.  Chipotle Chicken Avocado - My wife's favorite of the 3. Large chunks of juicy chicken, a good amount of bacon and compared to most other sandwich joints, huge pieces of avocado. The chipotle sauce had great flavor and didn't overpower the sandwich which I really liked.  The Italian - This was our least favorite of the 3 but still a good sandwich. The flavor was great but they put way too much Italian dressing on it. My favorite part was the cheese, I am a cheese lover and they put huge slices of fresh mozzarella on here...amazing!  The bread was exactly the same on all 3 and it's definitely up their in the top for sandwich joints. It tastes fresh baked and it has perfect texture. It's a bit like ciabatta but without the crisp outside. Chewy all the way through, taste good and super soft. Just excellent bread!  We also had some sides...potato salad and a fruit cup. The potato salad was ok and the fruit was fresh but neither stood out except for the prices. They give you very small prepackaged cups of the sides and they cost $2.49 each. I wish I had tried the mac n cheese that everyone seems to rave about.  Was this the best sandwich I ever ate? No...but they were definitely on the top and deserve every bit of the thousands of positive reviews they get. They do have quite a small seating area and I'm usually not big on going down to the strip just to eat, but I wouldn't hesitate going back for more. In my opinion, PH has some of the best spots for food on the strip and Earl's is one of them.",

I came to the Planet Hollywood location to pick up a Caribbean Jerk Chicken Sandwich ($6) and wasn't impressed with the flavor, breading or amount of chicken. They are suppose to add a spicy jerk sauce but I couldn't taste any additional \"bite\". When I asked to remove the inside breading, they took a knife and made my roll paper thin compared to pulling out the breading.   It's a simple concept; you order and they give you a pager when your sandwich was ready. The staff were young and didn't pay very much attention to customer service. Lots of seating and it can get very busy throughout the day.   Maybe I ordered the wrong thing but for $6, you can't beat a quick bite on the strip and head back to the craps tables!",

The sandwiches are small and there's hardly any meat in them to the point where you might wish you had more... or perhaps ordered two for yourself.    We got:  Pastrami Reuben - I really liked this as the flavor was definitely there but was disappointed when there was hardly any pastrami in my sandwich.  If I were to come back, I'd get this one again, though, since I'm a fan of pastrami.  The Full Montagu - This had roasted beef, turkey, swiss, cheddar cheese, lettuce and tomatoes.  This wasn't bad but it definitely had more meat than the other sandwich.  Again, the sandwich was the same size as the other -- small!   This place is convenient if you are either staying around the strip but I'd rather drive and explore what else Vegas has to offer.  I'm sure they have better sandwiches that have generous portions of meat for about the same price.  As good as the pastrami reuban was (minus the lack of pastrami), I'm most likely to pass these sandwiches up and drive to some place else.  Worth a try, though!",

Each sandwich is around $6, nice and hot meal, important when you are hungover around the hours of 1-3am where nothing is open! The lines are always long but it goes quickly and totally worth it. My favorites include Ham and cheese (classic), the full Montagu (meatlover's delight), and the Original (yummy roast beef!). I also tried the Meatball but it was just ok... Their salads are also good as well~mediterranean and chinese chicken salad are my favorite. I haven't tried their desserts but I heard they are good. I don't even like mustard but there is something about Earl's mustard that makes sandwiches magical! I wish I knew the secret! Their roast beef is really juicy and soft, it melts in your mouth!  This place is also a good place to people-watch. Lots of funny drunk people stumbling, munching like zombies, then passed out in a corner.  Also conveniently located next to Planet Hollywood and Miracle Mile shops if you are staying there. I was sick and tired of spending a ridiculous amount of money for Denny's-shit food that finding this place was like heaven for me!

My hubby has tried several of their other sandwiches and has never had any complaint.    Why I only gave four stars is because of the people taking my order.  They have never been friendly. Always seem to have the look of \"I want to be anywhere but here\".  If I had a question or wanted to change the cheese they offered on the sandwich it seemed like I just another anoying customer they had to deal with.",

Bread is amazing.  Toasty and crunchy on the outside while remaining soft and moist on the inside. Drool.  The Original 1762: Earl's take on a classic roast beef sandwich.  Pretty good but be prepared for the slight horseradish kick.  The Full Montagu: Deli sandwich with roast beef, turkey, swiss and cheddar.  Delicious, my current favorite.",

I love that bread is toasted and everything comes together so well in just about 10-15 minutes. Their bacon is delicious! Breakfast sandwiches are around $3.50 and is probably cheapest breakfast you can get besides perhaps McDonalds.   Quick hint: The lines are always long, but it moves pretty quickly. BUT if you call in for your order, your order comes out even before the people who are waiting in line! Saves you so much time!!",

I absolutely love warm sandwiches, and Earl's does them well with their consistent, perfectly toasted bread. I definitely have no regrets eating Earl's more than once during my stay in Vegas.  My favorite sandwich would have to be the Tuna Melt, but the Montagu and Earl Club are also delish! The Cannonball was just ok. I probably wouldn't get that again.   If the line is a bit daunting, all you have to do is make a phone order and pick up your sandwich when it's ready at the cash register. No need to wait in that ridiculous line. Even better, if you're staying in Planet Hollywood and you don't want to go out for a meal, you can make the call from your room and lounge around while you wait.  I wouldn't go as far as saying Earl's has the best sandwiches ever (perhaps that's the drunken Vegas talk/hype), but they definitely do sandwiches right. It's a great way to get a quick and cheap meal when time and money are tight, which is pretty often while you're in Vegas.  Unfortunately, it may be hard to find a place to sit, so beware if you came in a group of a bajillion people.",

I don't necessarily understand what the hype is about surrounding these sandwiches. But I'm thinking one of the main reasons its so popular is because of the lack of places to eat on the Strip that don't break the bank. I appreciate the variety of flavors and influences on top of the more traditional sandwiches on the menu. Plus I like the idea of healthy options available @ 3am. However! Two nites in a row at around 3 or 4am-ish they were resetting their systems. Why? When you know you're about to get a huge rush of hungry belligerents coming after you? No bueno.   From what my hazy memory can recollect, all the sandwiches I've had and taken random bites from have been consistently solid, hot and tasty. Good enough for me. Everything tastes like your eating sweet ambrosia picked from Athena herself when you're toasted/FUBAR anyhow.",

Hot turkey slices with stuffing, gravy, cranberry sauce and mayo. Its like thanksgiving heaven!! May I add that the bread was so fresh and perfectly toasted so it was soft yet crunchy. I can only assume all of the other sandwiches taste just as amazing. And veryyy affordable! If youre looking for a lunch spot, look no further. The five star reviews are real!",

You also can't beat the prices at roughly $6-$7 for a quality sandwich. The bread here is what really sets them apart as well as it is always fresh and gets even better when they toast it. This review is for multiple visits and a few of the sandwiches.  -Carribean Jerk: Great sando, the banana peppers make this sandwich with the extra kick.  - Italian: I love italian sandwiches and this one was good but not one of my favorites, still solid though. Think I prefer an italian sando cold versus hot.  - The Original: Can't beat it. Great horseradish sauce , quality roast beef and sharp cheddar. Win  - Hawaiian BBQ: Fairly standard Hawaiian BBQ sandwich. Tasty but not as good as the original or the jerk.",

Seriously if you're in Las Vegas and just want a snack, you have to try Earl of Sandwich! This was my snack before we hit the Planet Hollywood Buffet. I've tried 4 different sandwiches during my stay at LV. None of them were disappointing. All the sandwiches are warm and melt in your mouth good!  During my first time here I didn't know what to do so pointer! First look at the menu, decide what you want, order your sandwich/food at the first cashier area. Then walk down the cafeteria-esk counter and pick other goodies you want. Finally pay at the cash register at the end of the counter and they'll give you a buzzer for when your food is ready.  Yay a new review for a new year for a great place! Yum! ^-^",

The stuff in the middle of the sandwich was just the cherry on top. =)  I shared the sandwiches family style with my friends and we tried the the Original, the Full Montague and the All American. I chose the All American because love cranberry with turkey. So delish! The seasonal special was a another turkey sandwich with cranberries and the fixin's. I was tempted to try that too!   All the sandwiches were delicious and stuffed to the brim with meat and veggies. I'm  not sure which one I liked the best, but I found that the Full Montague and the All American tasted similar. The original had a stronger taste to it due to the horse radish sauce. I totally could have just ate half of a sandwich and been full. The portion size is good. For about $5.99 per sandwich it's a great deal! The lined moved super fast and the sandwiches came out super fast too. They have their system totally down.   Just one thing to note, make sure that you check your recipe after you order and make sure it's what you really want. We originally ordered The Club, but the guy at the register put down the Full Montague on our receipt and we were unwrapping our sandwich when we noticed the mix up.   Good CHEAP eat in Vegas! You don't see much of these so enjoy!",

Not only is it a good sandwich, you are paying clearance prices given where you are at. Located on the strip in Planet Holleywood, you cannot find a satifying meal for the price.   I'm normally not a sandwich fan because of how dry it is, but I don't get that way with Earls. The toasted bread and taste of the sandwich make for a good meal. One weekend, all I ate was Earls (not recommended).   A great lunch place for frequent Vegas go-ers at a good price. If you only come to Vegas every so often and don't care about price, this is not for you. There are plenty of 5 star restaurants all over Vegas.",

That little tidbit of observation aside, this place is amazing! We have tried The Original 1762, Earl's Club, Carribean Jerk Chicken, and their Holiday Turkey Sandwich, and they are allll DELICIOUS, so good I simply have to shout about it. =) The best part of all is, each sandwich is only $5.99, in omg-everything-is-so-expensive-VEGAS! =)  In the 5 days we were in Vegas, we have had 8 sandwiches from Earl of Sandwich, and for fear of sounding like gluttons, 4 of those were their Holiday Turkey Sandwich. If you cannot make up your mind which sandwich to pick, just pick that! You won't be sorry. It's like a turkey dinner you can eat in one hand, while you gamble with your other.",

One last tip = get the brownie ice cream sandwich ($3.29) -- a scoop of ghiradelli vanilla ice cream between 2 HUGE chewy brownies, what a treat and a steal.",

Whether you're craving something yummy for lunch or trying to cure that hangover at 4 in the morning, Earl's is your answer! Open 24 hours and only $5.99 for a sandwich, I can honestly say nothing beats an Earl's sandwich when you're vacationing in Vegas.   I have heard that all of the sandwiches here are delicious, but I have only tried 2 so far - the tuna melt and Caribbean jerk chicken. To die for! The sandwiches here are so amazing I had to come here one last time and ordered 2 to-go before my flight back home. I had to bring back some proof of Earl's deliciousness :)  Earl's also has one of the best potato salads and chocolate chip cookies I have ever tried, and at a very affordable price! The staff here are also very friendly and quick to serve your food.  I recommend Earl's to anyone going to Vegas for a vacation and looking for a cheap, good eat. I could eat their sandwiches for every meal :)",

    "text": "3 1/2 stars.  Earl of Sandwich, thank you for providing a relatively inexpensive, 24-hour option with some healthy selections in the middle of a casino.  Even if your Cobb salad didn't quite seem like a \"Cobb salad\" to me (no egg, no avocado, had Swiss/cheddar cheese and Ranch buttermilk dressing, and was not chopped - but, was fresh).   The tomato soup is a touch creamier than I would like but still had a nice tomato tang, and had nice big croutons swimming in it.   I sampled both the \"Cannonballs\" meatball sandwich and the Original 1762 roast beef sandwich.  Both were on what I suppose is Earl of Sandwich's signature bread, which is pretty good.  It looks a little crusty, but is still quite soft and spongy, and chewy.  Both sandwiches were pretty good.  The meatball sandwich had enough meatballs to fill the sandwich, the sauce was nice and tomato-y, and there was melty cheesiness, but not too much.  About what you expect from a meatball sandwich, when nothing goes wrong.  The roast beef sandwich was also good.  I liked the horseradish and would have preferred a little more of that, and a little less creaminess, but that is just me.  Overall, this is not a place I would travel out of my way for.  But, it is a great option to have in the middle of the Las Vegas strip, when your wallet doesn't feel like going big for the evening.",

The Montague being more traditional with roast beef, turkey, Swiss, lettuce, tomatoes and sweet mustard was very tasty.  The Caribbean Jerk Chicken was tender, moist and the sweet peppers had a spicy kick.  Also, had the Cobb salad, a side of pasta salad, macaroni salad, brownie bites, and a frozen lemonade.  All this plus a soda and a bag of chips came to total $30.  It would have easily fed 4 people!     It's definitely the best place to grab a sandwich on the strip.",

It is open 24 hours, but I don't know if this is good drunkard food, what with all the melted cheese and stuff.... although there might be long line, the wait is not that bad and it moves fairly quickly!  What we had: -potato salad in a cup: over priced (it is vegas) and not worth it -bag of chips: standard -loaded potato soup: I don't really know why i got soup in vegas, but I did, and it wasn't that great -Montague: basically hella meat turkey staked on roast beef and the usual toppings: swiss cheese, tomato onion lettuce, etc this sandwich was very flavorful...beef plus turkey makes for a savory taste.  -All American: this is the sandwich i HIGHLY RECOMMEND trying! turkey with cheese, lettuce tomato onions and the one ingredient that makes this sandwich so succulent is the cranberry jam! every time i bit into this sandwich it was like fireworks, like the scene from ratatouille where he envisions fireworks! yea like that!  and a frozen lemonade: basically lemonade blended with ice! pretty good!  Surprisingly the sandwiches were 5.99, a pretty decent price that you will find in vegas.   So get in line and try this place!",

So guys, do not under any circumstances let your wife/girlfriend try any sandwich you get from this place unless you never want to see it again.

Usually when I see tuna melt on the menu I kinda skip over it and look for a sandwich with turkey/meat, avocado or bacon, but I just had to try the Tuna Melt and I'm glad I did! Within less than 24 hours (5p-10a) I already visited Earl's on my stay in Vegas, good thing we were staying at PH. Next time I think I'll place my order over the phone and just pick up.   Can't wait till the one in Downtown Disney opens up, but I'm wishing they could just open one up in the SFV or even Woodland Hills!  *If you like bacon all their sandwichs w/ bacon have a nice crunchy piece of bacon in every bite!",

You order, pay, and they'll call your number when your food is ready.   I have no idea how they did it, but the bread was soo soft and delicious. Their bread is Truely unique. It really helps with the sandwiches.  Food: 1) Full Montagu - The one thing I worry about ordering roast beef and turkey sandwiches is that they're dry. You don't have to worry about that here. Combine these two well cooked meats with swiss and cheddar cheese, lettuce, tomatoes and mustard sauce you get a simple, yet delicious deli sandwich. 2) Tuna Melt - I don't usually order Tuna Melts but the Tuna melt was AWESOME! It's a very simple tuna sandwich with cheese.   3) Chocolate Chip Cookie - AMAZING cookie! Even though it was sitting in a package, the cookie was still REALLY soft and the chocolate was still gooey.",

I've tried several of their sandwiches and each were very freshly made, warm and with quality flavor. My favorite part is the bread that they use. It's perfectly toasted each time and just goes so well with the rest of the ingredients. Thank goodness they are open 24/7 because it definitely is the spot to go to late at night. It's also pretty easy to get to. It's right inside the planet Hollywood. If they had another location off the strip near my apartment it would be even more perfect",

    "text": "No Vegas Trip is complete without a trip to Earl of Sandwich!!!  Seriously, the best 5.99 you will ever spend in Vegas, because you are guaranteed hot deliciousness.  For a long time I heard the buzz of famous Earl of Sandwiches and I was worried that they would not live up to the hype.  But during 2011 I had the opportunity to make two trips to Vegas and I finally go to experience the amazingness for myself.     I have tried the following two of the sandwiches on the menu:  The Full Montagu- Roast beef, turkey, swiss, cheddar, lettuce, tomatoes, and of course yummy mustard.  It is called the full montagu for a reason.  It really has all of the sandwich essentials.  At 3 am it was worth the extra cab ride.  The Original - Roast beef, cheddar, and horseradish.  Of the two I think this was my favorite.  It was uncomplicated and gets straight to the meaty cheesy flavor with a tiny kick of the creamy horseradish.  So it doesn't have any vegetables...you don't go to Vegas to eat healthy!    Here are some fun facts/helpful tips:  1.  It is open 24 hours so if you had a little too much fun in the night, don't worry you can always get your grub on at any time  2. Divide and conquer! Send someone to scout and grab a table and send someone else to place the orders that way by the time your food is ready you should have a place to enjoy and rest your sore feet  OVERALL: A MUST GO!",

Located inside Planet Hollywood's Miracle Miles shops, I'm glad I took the time and $6.48 to try the Holiday sandwich. The bread was nicely toasted and every bite was like a piece of Thanksgiving over and over again. I loved the contrast of gravy with stuffing with the turkey and dipping it all in cranberry sauce. SO GOOOODD!!!  Why only 4 stars then? Super crowded. Would be better if there were more tables available. Management, if you are reading this, please make the Holiday sandwich available year round (and in the SF Bay Area!) :)",

WRONG! holy cow. i tried earl of sandwich this past weekend when i was in vegas and it blew me out of the water.  it changed my perspective on what a \"good\" sandwich is forever.   i got the full montagu sandwich and when i opened the foil wrapper, noticed how warm and toasty the bread was.  when i pulled the two halves apart, i could literally taste the chewiness of the bread without taking my first bite.  and oh, the first bite...heavenly.  i dont know HOW or WHY it tasted so great but the bread, the fresh veggies, the meats and the mustard (OH the mustard) just started fist pumping and partying in my mouth.   i almost cried when my meal was over. im seriously going to start a petition for someone to open one up out here or good god, give me money so i can do it.",

The bread is probably the best part since it's soft but toasted with almost a biscuit quality to it.

Stop by here for a quick eat and though the line may be long it seems to move pretty quick.",

Located conveniently by the entrance/exit of Planet Hollywood's Casino and the entrance/exit of the Miracle Mile, right across from that over the top bar... I forgot what it's called with their neon red sign. Anyway moving on.   I HIGHLY recommend everything on their menu. A few of my personal favorites are The Original, Hawaiian BBQ (tarty but no overload), Full Montagu (the sauce is delish), and the Club. The ingredients are written on the board underneath the sandwich names, and it pretty much explains it all. They keep it simple and tasty and keep you coming for more. The best part about Earl's is the bread. It's so warm and soft and has a light but hearty taste.   My friends and I love Earl's so much we all grab two sandwiches on our way back home. And when a friend of mine went a couple of weeks ago, I made sure she brought me back a sandwich. Yes. That's how bomb it is.  + 24 hours. Win! + Plenty of seating and people are circulating tables, for the most part. + Grey Popoun sauce! - Line can get very long very fast. Especially lunch time and late night.  Just writing this review has got me craving.... Oh no! :(",

I ordered the Mac and cheese and the chicken chipotle. The Mac and cheese was amazingly delicious, but I wouldn't say it's the best. I wished it was a bit more crunchy at the top part though because only some parts were crunchy.  When I saw the chipotle chicken, I was disappointed that the sandwich was small. I'm not a big eater but compared to New York, the price I paid for the sandwich would definitely be bigger than what I got at Earl's. The sandwich as a while was magnificent, but again I wouldn't say it's the best. I felt like there wasn't enough chicken and avocado too. But the bread combination along with the rest of the ingredients matched. I can pretty much say that I would definitely come back here again and I highly recommend this sandwich spot to anyone who comes to Vegas!!",

I wanted to try something different so I ended up ordering the Hawaiian BBQ sandwich which was an absolute delight. It was by far one of the best sandwiches I had eaten in a while.

Seems odd, but if you consider the fact that they're open 24 hours, have mouth watering sandwiches for cheap, and that they're located at a convenient location on the strip, it's not hard to believe.   My favorite sandwich is the thanksgiving turkey! It's seriously amazing, especially if you ask them for more of the cranberry sauce and douse the entire thing in it. It's so good that I had it three days in a row when I was staying at ph.   All their sandwiches are top notch though, my second favorite is probably the full montagu. The bread is made to perfection on all hot sandwiches.  They offer salads and wraps as well if you're in a healthier mode. As a side I like the macaroni salad or a soup. For dessert they have this brownie ice cream sandwich that is wonderful. It's probably best to share between two people though cuz it can get overwhelming.   They also sell beer - it's not Vegas without alcohol! Lines can get long but it moves quickly. They have a good system going to take orders and have food ready in a snap. Plenty of seating inside as well.   Definitely will continue coming when in town!",

I love how my hungry appetite disappeared right away because of this sandwich and my other favorite, the Original 1762.

The sandwiches are warm and toasty and very filling. I got the Full Montagu which comes with roasted beef, turkey, Swiss, sharp cheddar, lettuce, tomato & mustard sauce. It is pretty tasty and I definitely want to try their other sandwiches. One of my fave things that I got was the brownie peanut butter creme sandwich. The brownie is soft and the peanut butter goes perfectly with the chocolate goodness. I bought two more for my ride back haha.  **TIPS** 1) The desserts just sit there as you wait in line. I recommend the brownie peanut butter creme sandwich! 2) Enjoy!",

Check around, nothing else like it exists on The Strip.  Naturally, I had to go (mainly because I needed a break from $75 food bills for lunch).    EoS is good, really good.  There's a huge variety of sandwiches that are all delicious and easy on the wallet.  It's really close to about half the strip, and even if you need to take a $15 cab, you're going to save money in the long run.  There's a breakfast menu which is open until 11am (I never made it), but the rest of their hot sandwich menu suits me just fine.   I had the Chicken Chipotle Avocado thing, and later I had the Original 1786 or whatever.  The Original needed more sauce on the (the horseradish was great, but it needed more).  I got the Chicken Chipotle with extra sauce and it was awesome.  For like $7 a sandwich, you can't go wrong.  Note:  The sandwich isn't huge.  I only needed one, but I don't eat a lot.  Most dudes I hang with would need two to fill them up.    Note2: If you go for dinner, head into the PH and check out the Pleasure Pit.  You'll see.....",

I've had the Hawaiian, some kind of BBQ one, and the roast beef.  All seemed okay to me.  Didn't make me want to go out of my way or jump for joy to get one.  It's a good sandwich, indeed.  Not really what people have made it to be.",

I must have gotten there at a good time, as there were only a few people ahead of me in line. I got my sandwich very quickly and headed back to the hotel room.  I ordered the Hawaiian BBQ sandwich. A bit pricey considering the size of the sandwich itself. If you're a big eater, one sandwich definitely will NOT fill you up! The taste of the sandwich was pretty good, but it reminded me of a Quizno's sandwich. I think it was the ham (thin sliced) and the sauce, which tasted EXACTLY like the sauce you find at Quizno's. That's definitely not a bad thing, but I wouldn't call it the \"World's Best Hot Sandwich.\"  Would I come here again? Probably, if I'm looking for a small, quick food option.",

I'm pretty sure I ate thanksgiving like meals the whole time I was there, and Earl of Sandwich was no exception. The sandwich I had was GREAT though! I dont remember the name, but it had Turkey and maybe bacon and cranberry sauce and ranch on it. Sounds like an odd combo-but it was wonderful. Had a cookie for desert but it wasn't anything special.",

    "text": "So, this place is a bit hard to find, but in the monstrosity that is the Las Vegas strip what isn't? I would suggest entering Planet Hollywood Casino from the Southern entrance near the Fire bar and looking for the information desk. Don't actually talk to the information desk, mind you, but you'll see Earl's nearby. It's also posted on a lot of information signs overhead.  We visited this place twice in one weekend because we were so enamoured with these sandwiches. They have a wide variety of choices, and the many I tried all punched me in the face with savoury sandwich superiority. They don't seem that customizable in terms of toppings or bread options, but honestly I didn't ask. The bread is probably some of the best I've had on a 'wich. Simultaneously crispy and soft; a perfect vessel for all the delicious toppings.   For a sandwich shop tucked into the base of the Planet Hollywood casino that always seems to have a line no matter what time you go, the prices are pretty reasonable. The service is quick (though fast-foodish), and pretty pleasant even if you show up at three in the morning (which we did).  My faves were the Carribean Jerk Chicken and the Full Montagu. The sandwiches are not huge so sharing three or four among a couple is not unreasonable. Especially if you are a glutton like me.  Obligatory Title Pun: EARL-y to bed and EARL-y to rise.  Menu Readability: Is there an Illustrator action called \"Corporate menu design\"?  Need to mention: They have their own brand of kettle chips. Decent.  What this place teaches me about myself: Mmm. Sandwiches.",

The Full Montagu tasted like a cheese burger to me. I love burgers as much as the next person, but I found myself wishing that we had ordered the Original instead. I'd have love the taste of horseradish on roast beef.   The broccoli cheddar soup was very good. My girlfriend didn't enjoy it as much; she claimed Subway is better. I thought it was delicious.

    "text": "Holy f**k their sandwiches are pretty damn good! I touched down in Vegas last Thursday around 2PM and I was f**king hungry. Since my friends and I were staying in Paris, I remember this place had opened up in Planet Hollywood, but I never got around to going. Thanks to Jeffrey L. and Clarisse C., I was reminded of this place too.   So I made the short walk from Paris to try this out. I liked the fact that the line wasn't long at all, but there were a fair amount of customers. For a little over 6 bucks, I started off with the Montagu. I also like the efficiency on how orders are made, with the two separate order/pickup sections, and the ability to see your sandwich being made.   Little did I know that this sandwich would pack a lot of flavor. There was a fair portion of ingredients in between the bread, and the bread itself was perfectly baked. I savored every bite, but apparently I enjoyed this place so much I ended up buying 7 sandwiches over the course of the weekend, 2 of them which I brought home that following Sunday. Over the weekend, I also tried the Italian/Scudetto and the club.   I really think any sandwich here will hit the spot. You also get your money's worth, and for Vegas, its kinda cheap. Who needs the buffets? Actually, I do like buffets, but Earl's is the spot to go when you're on a budget. Try this place for the bread alone. I hope you enjoy it as much as I do. Though I wish they had a location in the Bay Area, I like its exclusivity and I also would like to preserve its novelty. Word. Cheerio.",

I've been here twice now and Earl of Sandwich has demonstrated consistency in terms of quality hot sandwiches and customer service. I've had the Earl's Club and the Full Montagu. The sandwiches are cut in half and when you pull them apart, a string of cheese follows--YUM! The club sandwich had turkey, bacon, swiss cheese, tomatoes, lettuce, and some sort of sauce. The Montagu sandwich had swiss and cheddar cheese, turkey, roast beef, lettuce, tomatoes, and Earl's mustard sauce! Both sandwiches were made from fresh ingredients and both tasted great, but I enjoyed the Montagu sandwich better because I'm a fan of mustard! I also tried the vegetable medley soup and I'm not sure whether it was because I was hung over, but I swear it was the heartiest soup I've ever had.   The staff is very friendly and although they don't act as waiters/waitresses, they were still accommodating from behind the counter. Prices are fair and I'll come back again when I'm looking for a quick bite in Vegas.",
