Light, fluffy in a nice cone shape that makes the easy to eat, overall one word describes them decadent.  Got the banana one which was great, but eager to try the others.  Also ordered a Mont Blanc, which was good.  Not going to say anything negative about it... but compared to the crepe was an afterthought.",

The chef, whom's name I regrettably forgot, suggested we try it with their signature caramel Shoya sauce. After making the same facial expression you're probably making right now, we agreed to it because, let's face it, it's CARAMEL! Oh my god! That was the second best crepe desert I've ever had. The first one being the one I ate in Greece!!! This place is small but cozy and the staff are sooooo friendly! We are most certainly coming back here!!!!!",

There are only a few tables, I believe two or three tables, there was only one group of two there when I went, they happened to be speaking Japanese too.  I went without knowing what to expect, as I've been disappointed with Japanese food in Las Vegas (being from Japan and spending most of my life there, I tend to know what tastes authentic). But to my surprise I was quite pleased with this place!   I got the strawberry shortcake and green tea cake. They were about $2-4 each (will check prices next time), but that's actually basically considered \"normal\" in Japan so I don't mind the prices too much.   The strawberry shortcake tasted just like the ones I've had in my local bakeries back in Japan, there's a slight difference, but it's hardly noticeable. I will definitely be getting more of them! They aren't sweet and some may not like it because it definitely isn't like American sweets at all. It's like a sponge cake base but it is not as fluffy as American sponge cake, it may seem a little bland to some (my friend felt it was bland).   The green tea cake is just like matcha green tea taste. If you're a fan of green tea and something not super sweet this is another good one, it also tastes like the ones from Japan as well.   The two I've tried so far have very authentic tastes from Japan, I will definitely be coming back to try other things!",

But when I called the day before yesterday , they were asking me to pay on the phone . I made order for 2 birthday cakes for two different date. And I was told they've changed the policy that I have to pay both cakes on the phone .so I did paid for both . But when I called yesterday to order the cake they already made (they make whole cakes like 6-8 inches every morning when they open ), they were asking me to pay by the phone too , I told them I can't , because it's for my sister and she is already on the way to the bakery shop and she was actually already there ,(my sister only speaks limited English )they wouldn't make the order cuz they wants me to pay first , no matter how I explained the situation. I was like seriously ? WTH? I understand they don't want to lose money to take the order without get the money first ,but come on , these are the cakes they already made , and I always order from them , and even I have already paid for my 2 cakes for couple of days later , I was so mad , cuz the reason I'm calling because my sister don't speak good English , so I want to make it convenient for her , and it turns out when they give her the cake, they talked a lot to her and pretty much means she has to order and pay on her own ! My sister feels so embarrassing . I don't know how can they treat their customers like that , I will never go back to this place again !",

My taste buds got ansty and said this oil change better be super jiffy because a crepe sounds divine.   I walked in and was immediately drawn to the pastry display case. After much debate because everything looked so good, my husband and I settled on a Mini Chocolate Cream Puff for $1 each. That was my appetizer because I also ordered a Strawberry, Whipped Cream and Nutella Crepe for $5 (the Nutella was an additional 50 cents).   The cream puff was light and fluffy. I loved the chocolate cream. The crepe knocked my socks off! I was a little annoyed at myself for agreeing to share with my husband because it was so good. The crepe batter was divine and there was just the right amount of fresh strawberres, Nutella and whipped cream.  This pastry shop is very quaint and cute. There are only two tables. I anticipate they would need to add more seating soon because word about this place will spread like wildfire.  The workers were very friendly and smiley.

I was looking to order a cake for a bachelorette party and sadly missed their 2-day ordering window by 1.5 hrs because (1) their hours are surprisingly short (2) they stand by their store policy very strictly. However, seeing how determined I was to secure a cake from them, the lady kindly assured me all cakes are baked fresh every morning and I would most likely be guaranteed a cake if I call first thing at opening time: 11am to reserve a cake. Even though we were unable to get the cake we wanted because it was special order only, the Strawberry Shortcake did not disappoint. All the girls loved it. If I'm ever in Vegas again and need a cake, I'll know to place it 2 days in advance. It's a bit ways away from the strip, but so worth it!",

However, since I am not living in Hong Kong anymore and Lady M from New York is far away, SUZUYA PASTRIES & CREPES IS ONE OF THE BEST AND MY TOP 3.  Service is friendly and excellent which you can always expected from Japanese store.  I have the Ham and Cheese Crepes which is Awesome. I do order lots of pastries and cakes because my wife love sweet, while I have my crepes, the staffs have my order ready and store in the fridge for me so my cakes are nice and cool when I get out. I order 6 different cakes (blueberry cheesecake, strewberry shortcake, tiramisu, mont blac, regular Tokyo cheesecake, and green tea millecrepes) and apple pie. I will have more pictures and update once I have all their cakes.   Try (Green Tea Millecrepes, Toyko Cheesecake,  and Tiramisu) tonight... My wife like the Green Tea and Tiramisu the most... Green Tea Millecrepes: remind me traditional Japanese sweet. Green Tea and Sweet Red Bean compliment each other. Toyko Cheesecake: Different then the American cheesecake which is more dense. The Toyko Cheesecake is more light and fluffy. Tiramisu: really creamy and light. Not as good as mind",

Riding the public bus all the way here just for the pastries, oh middle and high school days.   You can never go wrong with Suzuya. They have a lot of signature pastries such as their Crepe Mille cakes, custards, creme puffs, and so on. I am a big fan of sweets and pastries, but for those who are not big fans, they can still find something delicious here. Everything is flavorful and not super sweet. I've not had one thing here that I didn't enjoy. I don't really like coconut and apple but having their coconut chiffon cake and their apple pies, oh man! Totally changed my mind! Somedays I just sit wherever I am and crave for that apple pie. My favorites other than the apple pie include the Yuzu panna cotta, Mont Blanc, green tea Mille, and the kabocha pie.   Great for a date! The atmosphere itself is quite quaint and super cute. There are limited chairs, just be aware.   Otherwise, Suzuya is worth the drive if you don't live in the Southwest area.",

It's sort of a ritual for me to stop by here whenever I would visit the Filipino market a couple of doors down.   About 2 weeks ago they started carrying their seasonal Kabocha (Japanese pumpkin) items and of course I had to try it. Also available that day was the elusive Matcha green tea mille crepe ($4.50) It was love at first bite for me: The Kabocha pie ($3.25) is rich and decadent, the natural sweetness of the squash breaking thru and perfectly complements the buttery crust. The matcha green tea mille crepe is perfection in a slice. With the very prominent flavor of matcha incorporated in the cream and anko red bean for added sweetness in between layers of delicate crepe. In another visit I was given a sample of their version of nama chocolate and it tastes just like Royce! It'll be a bonus if they can make the matcha variety as well.   Pro tip: Call in advance, especially if you want their seasonal items, they go by fast! They will hold them for you if you plan to go within the hour. If not, you can prepay for items and they'll put them aside for you. Trust me, those 2 items alone are worth the trip!",

It's a simple storefront with a display case showcasing there \"fancy\" looking desert creations. In addition to desert they also serve Japanese style crepes: sweet and savory varieties, as well as hot and cold. My sister opted to try their cannoli crepe which was a nice balance of flavors well distributed through the handheld creation. I decided to try the green tea and anko millicrepe, which was delectable. Perfect balance, smooth texture, and a distinguishable green tea matcha flavor.  We also ordered 2 mini cream puffs to go that they kindly held for us in the cooler until we were finished eating and were ready to go.   When I'm craving a nice desert I will definitely be coming back here!  I can't wait to go back and try the Tokyo cheesecake",

Desserts have a subtle sweetness making them good for a light snack or the perfect ending to a meal, as opposed to heavy desserts that you would instantly regret. Their cheesecake is unlike traditional cheesecakes you'll find in the states, with a light, airy mousse-like texture. Yuzu panna cotta has a smooth and creamy consistency with hints of citrus. The mango mille crepe is light and delicate with layers of pastry cream and mango between each crepe. Apple pie lovers will fall in love with their version. It's a rectangular work of art with flakey and buttery pastry covering sweet, caramelized Fuji apples.  If you want something more savory, the B.A.T. crepe is the way to go. Bourbon bacon, arugula, sun-dried tomatoes, mayo, avocado, and balsamic vinaigrette are wrapped in a crepe. The result is a mouth-watering combination of salty, acidic, savory flavors .  With dozens of different options and rotating seasonal items there's always a reason to return.",

With that said, it really is like someone plucked this quaint establishment right out of Tokyo and placed it in Las Vegas.  The decor is very minimalist, but inviting. There aren't a lot of staff there at any one point, but they are very warm and inviting.  The first thing you'll notice is the pristine case of various pastries up for sale. There is a solid mix of iconic French pastries like mille feuille and cream puffs along with some Japanese inspired treats such as the green tea cake and adzuki cream puff.  If you're in the market for overly sweet pastries however, this may not tantalize your sweet tooth. The pastries here are sweet enough to qualify as dessert, but aren't way too sweet.  My personal favorite was the cream puff! Shuukuri-mu or cream puffs are the first dessert I've ever had in Japan, and I can tell you that Suzuya's cream puffs are a far cry from the 'conbini' cream puffs I used to buy everyday. The cream is joined with custard and the pastry its stuffed in as flaky and semi-sweet. A fantastic addition is the vanilla bean mixed into the cream. It gives this puff so much more dimension that what I'm used to!  I also loved Coffee Jelly, which is made from a very bold blend of coffee. It comes topped with a dollop of whipped cream and they give you half and half as well.  On my way out, I purchased 3 slices of their strawberry shortcake to eat for Christmas. The cake with light and fluffy, and the topping as delicious! It's not strawberry season yet, so I found the largest strawberry on top a bit bitter, but that isn't really enough to not warrant it as a delicious cake.  I'd implore anyone who is intrigued by fancier treats and doesn't require a ton of sugar to satisfy them to check out Suzuya! I can't wait to go back & try their crepes!",

    "text": "Love, Love, Love this place! Not to mention, my favorite character from Tokyo Ghoul happens to be Juuzou \"Suzuya\", but that's besides the point. I have tried for weeks to get my hands on the infamous green tea crepe cake, but to this day I can't seem to find a right time when they're not \"sold out\" for the day. Nevertheless, their slices of cakes are to die for, and they have an amazing selection of crepes. Also if you get a little thirsty, and need something to wash down the decadent cake, I would recommend the Royal Milk Tea in a can. I know what your thinking, \"canned milk tea\" . . . \"yuck\", but this milk tea tastes as if the God's made it. I mean they call it \"royal\" for a reason (#nahwahimsayin). The nice lady at the register told me that it was a really big hit, and people would buy 5 cans at a time and like one slice of cake. I mean you think their cake would be dry or something for a person to buy 5 cans of milk tea for one cake, but I guess its just that good. Anyways, If your in a bit of a coffee mood, don't get your hopes up with what they have. I was expecting something doused in loads of milk and caramel sauce, but what I got was straight up black coffee with some caramel syrup. I mean it was a bit of a surprise when I drank it, but nothing a bit of almond milk and a dash a sugar couldn't fix.  P.S. I thought that little \"Suzuya\" decoration was chocolate, but surprise surprise, its actually plastic . . . or paper . . . anyways it's not edible. Man this places is just full of surprises. Also, another side note, I like their togo boxes. I have a twin sister so the logo made me think of us. :)",

    "text": "The Skinny: a symphony in your mouth. 'Nuff said. (5) Service: there really isn't much service here - counter service only and they only have two small tables to eat at(N/A) Value: expensive for the size but oh so worth it (5).  Now let me preface this review: these treats are Japanese in style. In general, I find that Asian pastries tend to be a little less sweet, rich and dense. It is its own esthetic that not everyone will be a fan of. So if you're looking for a really gooey chocolate chip cookie or a slice of uber luxurious cheesecake, you'll probably be disappointed. You have been warned.  Ah - what can I say about Suzuya Pastries?   Hidden behind a quick lube joint, you probably would miss it if you were driving too fast. Limited parking is also an issue due to the numerous shops (a nail salon, the quick lube, etc.) in such a small retail space.  But no matter. A trip to this bakery will take you less than 10 minutes. There really is no place to sit and eat because of the size of the shop (there's two small tables and maybe four chairs in the store). I'd imagine most people get the pastries to go. The selection is small so come earlier before it's all gone.  The time I went, I selected the Mont-Blanc chestnut cake, a kabocha pie and an apricot/almond pie. I did so to sample their two variety of crusts (a shortbread crust, a puff pastry crust) and their sponge. Suffice to say, I was genuinely impressed.  If you could only use one word to describe the Suzuya's pastries it would be this: symphony. They have a precision of flavors and textures that makes every note in your mouth sing. That's right - this place is the Ode to Joy of pastry perfection. It is a marriage of subtle spicing/sweetening (to enhance but not overwhelm the ingredients) and excellent technical skill.  The Mont-Blanc cake is sponge cake layered with pastry cream and chestnut puree. The sponge cake flavor is just right - not too heavy handed on vanilla. With all the pastry cream, it retained a wonderful texture despite all that moisture. Chestnut purees tend to be overly sweet but they were perfect here.  Kabocha pie - what a wonderful idea! It was a Japanese take on pumpkin pie and truly I was floored. What perfection of puff pastry crust! When it comes to pies, it's hard to find a pastry crust that is equally flaky even on the bottom. Well, lo and behold, Suzuya has it down to a science. The filling to pastry to ratio was just right as well.   Finally, the apricot/almond pie. This was the husband's favorite pastry. A crispy shortbread crust adorned with glazed apricots and moist almond filling. So good and it was the special of the day.  If I have one criticism of this place, it is the prices. The three items I purchased added up to $12-ish. For the price, it would be nice to have a larger portion size for each of the desserts. However, that being said, I have paid way more for dessert elsewhere and received significantly less enjoyment.  Overall, for some amazing Asian pastries, this place is a 5 starred place in my books.",

Presentation-wise, these cakes are absolutely adorable to stare at. I am always tempted to buy a glass case and collect all these creations and display them at my living room. Then, of course my raging belly always trumps that 30-second thought. Yeah, these get eaten within minutes in my household.  The crepes here are well-made, served with cool whipped cream with your choice of fruits which fill the soft crepe delicately folded into a cone. If you've never had Japanese pastries before, Suzuya is an excellent introduction. The pastries are light, fluffy and mildly sweet, lending to a more refined taste. I like that sugar does not take overpower the flavors of fresh berries; seasonal fruits unabashedly take the spotlight here.     This is one of our favorite pastry shops to date. I have tried *almost* everything here and they are all delicious. My personal favorites are the green tea cake, apple pie, & the mille crepe. I highly recommend to check it out even if you don't live in the SW area.",

Maybe I expect some eureka moment on the first bite for that truly exceptional dessert cake, which I'm not exactly sure I've ever had...  Maybe there is a limit to how \"good\" dessert cakes can be from a taste standpoint.    Stopping by on the way to mum's, I purchased several different pieces.  All were good to exceptional, with Millefeuille standing out, creme de chou and green tea cake being very good, and mont blanc being good but not great.  One thing that is clearly evident is the quality of the pastries, especially the chou which was light and sufficiently crispy but tender.  Pieces are appropriately priced at $4-5.  I haven't tried the crepes and plan on going back to do that, so there is a chance for me to award that additional star.  Until then I will say it's a 4.4 star, rounding down to 4.",

It wasn't too often that I could splurge on some delicious cakes, cream puffs, tarts and other such nummies but when I could, they were quite delicious.  I'm happy to say that Suzuya answers the call for my craving of fancy Japanese style cakes, cream puffs tarts and other such nummies in Las Vegas. =D  =:: Location ::= It's pretty far if your usual stomping grounds is the Strip being pretty far out west and a bit south but thankfully, if you take either 215 or Raphael Riviera to get there, it's not too much trouble to get there by car.  =:: Layout ::= Small little cafe setting with an excellent view of the days offerings in the glass case and of the crepe griddle as they are being made. Very clean and well kept.  =:: Service ::= Very excellent. I went during the afternoon on a weekday so I'm not sure what busy looks like and how well they handle it but I was greeted upon entering with a smile. I only got cakes and such to go but I will say that they took great care to place my goodies in the box and even taped down some small cardboard tubes to take up any empty space and prevent them from sliding and mixing during my drive back home.  =:: Food ::= I regret that I didn't get to try any of their crepes but I will go back and update once I do! As I started at all the goodies, I pretty much ended up walking out with nearly one of every thing on one shelf:  * Tiramisu: Was certainly a highlight so much that my roommate and I have decided we REALLY need our own serving next time we go there. * Green Tea cake/Strawberry Shortcake/Chocolate cake: Of course, I couldn't really eat everything in one sitting so I'm happy to say that their cakes and pastries survive VERY well in the fridge. Cakes were still moist days after and very enjoyable. If you like your cakes light and fluffy, this place is for you. * Mont Blanc: I will NEVER turn down mont blanc and this mont blanc made my mouth and tummy very happy. * Yuzu (lemon) Panna Cotta: Whoo! I bit more tart than I was expecting but still very good and creamy. * Plain Custard & Anko (red bean) cream puff: I prefer my cream puffs to have custard over whipped cream so that was definitely a plus. The anko was interesting in that I wasn't sure if it was just going to be a bit of it squeezed in or if it'd be incorporated into the cream. It's the first and while it's not bad, it's not great either. I suppose they want to be different from Beard Papas which offers a variety of flavors but I think the taste of beans and custard kinda blend too easily and there's no contrast. Regardless, I still scarfed it down! * Mille-Feuille: I wish I hadn't waited so long to have this because the pastry got soggy but regardless, the flavor was still very good by the time I got to it.  =:: Overall ::= Very happy, must go back to try crepes, both sweet and savory, and anything else I didn't end up getting that day. Really hoping they have strawberry mille crepe cake next time I'm in too!",

    "text": "This review is for the owners professionalism and not the crepes. I called at 5:48pm, asked if I can place an order for 3 crepes. They owner said no they stop accepting orders over the phone, which is understandable. I asked if I get there at 6 will that work? He said \"yes we'll make the crepes when you get here\". I asked again before we got off phone  \"if I get there there at 6 that'll work right?\" he said \"yeah\". We got to the place right at 6 and the doors were locked after he said that it was okay to come by. We got there right at 6! I called twice to let him know we're outside and no answer. I get it, we all want to shut down and leave after a long day but my issue is don't tell me it'll work and ignore us, I would have just turned my car around and go hone instead if he just said no.  That's just not professional! You guys lost a loyal customer! You are not the only place in Vegas that make crepes. Lol.",

Unfortunately, I have crazy high expectations based off of eating the best green tea crepe of my life in Cali. This is still a great fix, and I'm hoping they'll keep exploring their food creativity. Super friendly and accommodating. Their fuji apple pastries are SO yummy and all of their food is absolutely beautiful. Highly recommended for events or parties where you need to take a snack. Reasonably priced for such delicacy type eats. Love it!",

Tokyo Cheesecake - A lot milder than a regular cheesecake and has more sweeter hints than tartness...  Coffee Jelly - Done well....i fucked with coffee jelly as a young kid especially since i grew up on coffee milk.  Yuzu Panna Cotta - Think of a yuzu (cousin of lemon and orange) parfait...the bottom part was very tart like a yogurt.  B.A.T. Crepe -  light but made me full...bacon, avocado, and sundried tomatoes....   Ham & Cheese Crepe - Fire...exactly what it states...soo good  No idea what makes this place good other than it's fuckin good and that's that hahaha",

I actually had a really hard time deciding what to order because so many things in the glass case looked good. I thought I had it narrowed down and then I saw the crepe menu and things got harder. I'll basically have to make more visits to Suzuya in order to try everything I wanted lol. They can pack up your items for take home if you want to stop by and grab something for later or you can hope to snag a spot at one of the tables.   Regular Coffee ($2.85) - I wish the large size was larger, but the coffee tasted pretty good. They have a station with cream, sugar sweeteners, lids and napkins. The coffee was ground, brewed fresh and brought to my table piping hot. They have flavored coffees as well I look forward to trying in the future.   Banana, Chocolate and Whipped Cream Crepe ($4.50) - This handheld treat was very good. There was a good amount of banana, chocolate and whipped cream inside and the crepe itself held everything together nicely. I've seen many other places charge more for crepes, so it's nice to see they are priced so fair here. Actually I didn't see any of the sweet crepes over $5 and the savory ones not over $7.   They offer a variety of cakes and other desserts and if you love a good macaron they have plenty of different flavors here.",

    "text": "Honestly, everything about Suzuya is amazing. They serve up Japanese-style cakes, crepes, custards, and cream puffs plus more. Even as someone who enjoys heavy desserts, I still appreciate the subtle flavor of all their sweets. I've tried nearly everything here, and while I think most of its worth trying once, I definitely recommend two things:  1) Rocky Road crepe with Nutella and strawberries -- All their crepes are amazing. They're both fluffy and delicate, with the perfect sweetness level. But their rocky road crepe is on a whole other level. With whipped cream and house made marshmallows, this crepe is super fluffy. The sliced almonds and pocky stick give it a satisfying crunch, while the chocolate, Nutella, and strawberries easily complement each other. This crepe, by far, is the most jam-packed on their crepe menu. If you're feeling underwhelmed by the two-topping simplicity of the other crepes (while delicious), or you're feeling a lil extra, this is a definite must try and not for the faint of heart.   2) Chocolate cake -- I'm a True believer in food that makes you feel something. For instance, I mostly opt for rich and heavy desserts that make me feel self-hatred afterwards. Or regret. But this cake? This cake makes me feel sadness. I eat this cake, and I'm so sad when it's over because I fucking LOVE this cake. It's unbelievably light and fluffy, rich with chocolate flavor, but not overly sweet. Seriously, do yourself a favor and eat this cake. And as the cheesy saying goes, \"don't be sad that it's over, be glad that it happened.\"",

And the woman behind the counter was very helpful!   I eventually decided on their pudding Custard and two macaroons - one sesame and one red bean. I have to say that the sesame was the only disappointment as it was overly crunchy. It didn't have that nice chew that a Macaron should. I'm not sure if all the sesame ones are like this or if it was a fluke. Because the red bean was beautifully done! And I did appreciate that these Macarons weren't the teeny tiny size you usually see, they were just big enough to be more than just one bite.   The pudding Custard really reminded me of flan because of the caramel sauce at the bottom and because of the very delicate texture. Particularly in the middle, it was super smooth and creamy. I can't say no to a treat like this!",

Mochi would've been a regular too, for their chocolate cake.   Service is efficient, nice, smiley and always so helpful. Take out or stay a bit and enjoy loose leaf teas, hot & cold brew(on tap) coffees or even crepes. Small tables both inside and out. Clean restroom and shared parking available.

I got the Tokyo cheesecake which I thought for some reason would be like those jiggly airy Japanese cheesecakes, but it was more dense and not jiggly like you see in YouTube videos.  Maybe it's different because it's Tokyo cheesecake Burberry good.  I also got the strawberry millecrepe and that was good.  I have never had crepe cake so I have nothing to compare it to. The display case is so beautiful.  I will go back and try other things.  It's tucked away behind a Sonic and a Jiffy Lube. Service was efficient and friendly.",

I had heard from this place from a friend and I just had to check it out, from what they told me this place is pretty much dessert heaven!   WE TRIED EVERY CREAM PUFF THEY HAD! *Original creampuff *Tiramisu  *Chocolate *Matcha *Strawberry *Then a mystery one with a purple filling inside! Who knows what it was!!  We ate all of them with utter delicacy!  We tried the \"Tokyo cheesecake\" as well!  Just looking at it made me order it without even thinking! The texture is soft and fluffy and isn't overly sour or sweet!  My buddy and I tried the Strawberry + whipped cream crepe and the Nutella stuffed almond crepe!  Exploding with flavor, the powder sugar from the strawberry one was perfect!  Lastly we ordered the legendary \"YUZU PANA COTTA\" Sour at first, but has an insane comeback that knocks you out of your seat! For such a minuscule dish.. I would've never thought it would be this delectable.  To top it all off, our dessert came with GOLDEN SPOONS AND FORKS! Ahhhhhh! This place is perfect.  Low lit interior, very clean, nice and quiet inside, and extremely friendly service!  *You guys gotta get here early because they close early!*  Will be back!",

The  strawberry Millie crepe very flavorful and multi layered of strawberries. While I want to rave about the Yuzu panna cota.... omg soo good!!! It's perfect balance of tartness and sweetness yet strong citrus scent and flavor. We also had a cheese and ham crepe. All in all I had a fabulous time and highly recommend their food. I don't think you can go wrong with any of the choices.",

I'm a sucker for Nutella crepes. I'm kind of basic and don't like to step out of my comfort zone, but I know what I like and how I like it when it comes to a Nutella crepe. At Suzuya, they are always consistent. Warm, filling and large. Normally, a basic Nutella crepe wouldn't fill me up, but these do.   My wife always gets something different and always gets at least 3 pastries. Her favorites are the blueberry and green tea cream puffs, strawberry shortcake, green tea cake and the fruit tart. She is always extra satisfied when she eats her food from here. When she's happy with her food, I know it's going to be a good experience.   We always speak with the owners when we come in and they always remember us. That says a lot about how their standard is when it comes to customer experience.   Today, is a busy Saturday at the shop. They have hired a pretty hefty staff, with at least 6 people working right now. If you've been in, you know it's a small spot. That speaks a lot on how busy they are getting! They don't have an empty seat in the house!   I am so proud of them for how wonderful they are doing!   Service, food, everything. On point!",

Their desserts are fresh and made with japanese flour, which makes their products so much higher in quality. I personally love their mango mousse, blueberry cheesecake and strawberry millecrepes. I got a piece of greentea log cake and almond crepe on today's visit. The almond crepe was a little burnt and the elements inside were not evenly distributed as it usually is, but the greentea cake was good- although I wish they didn't put the rock sugars outside, which overpowered overall sweetness. They have always got friendly service and staff :)  Ps) my sister paid with a card different than the name of her ID, they asked for her ID,  and my sister didnt realize it was different until i told her. Not sure what is the whole purpose of checking ID for card transactions, but it could have just been a simple mistake.   Will still come back ! Just dont get your card stolen ;)",

Unfortunately they didn't have the crepe cake which my husband was wanting to try but the lady told me to call ahead and she would make it. I decided to not be such a gluttonous pig and just stick with the anko cream puff and green tea cake.  The anko cream puff had me at red bean and custard. Two of my favorite things! The outside end flaky and soft and the filling was oozing out after the first bite. Love the combination of red bean, custard and cream. This cream puff is definitely a winner in my book.   Green tea cake was good, but not my favorite. Maybe it was the hazelnut cream but anyways it was good just not my favorite. The new chocolate medallion that says Suzuya is nifty.   This place uses square wallet as their POS so you see how an iPad can be used and you can create a tab and not have to bring money to Suzuya if you use this app.   Overall, I think this place is quite awesome and like most Asian bakeries, the pastries aren't overly sweet. Perfect balance of sweetness to the two that I tried.",

The macaroons are really good as well and they have exotic flavors.  The B.A.T was my favorite savory crepe!! I loved how cozy, clean ans inviting this little place is. Def coming back for crepe cravings!!!",

The rest of the items were for preorder only. I realize the shop is busy and items will sell out, but for a business that calls itself a pastry shop I certainly expected a least a few different choices for the walk-in customer, especially when it's in the middle of the day!  The shop itself was full of customers having drinks but since we came for desserts, we were disappointed. I went out of the way to visit this place since we live in the opposite part of town. I'll certainly be calling in in the future to check whether they've got desserts in supply IF I ever decide to come back out here.",

Everything is like a piece of art and the quality of there work reflects the perfect sweetness of there pastries.",

I am so glad to discover this away from the strip gem. Now I have a place where I can grab fancy little treats without having to travel all the way to strip and truck my way through a busy crowded casino to indulge in beautiful desserts.  The reviews all have pretty much the same thing to say about how the cakes have no flavors and even though I have to agree I didn't have any this visit to judge but I did have some during Christmas when a customer of mine brought in a roll and the cake part itself was a little bland. But then again I know how Asian bakery or cakes are a little more on the dense and not too sweet side. With that said that's the only reason why I docked them 1 star, otherwise I would have given them a full 5 stars.   I am a little bit of a sweet tooth so I do wish that their cakes were sweeter. But everything I got today was so good. I will be back for more because I enjoy me some fancy sweet treats that are beautifully displayed in such a close comfy shop!  Everyone must try I know I will be back for more plus their full size cake looks amazing!",

I was looking foward to trying everything green tea: green tea cream puff, green tea mille crepe and green tea cake.  They only had the green tea cake...and before I turned green and angry like The Hulk, I saw their chocolate mousse tart with strawberry. So, I had a green tea cake, chocolate mousse tart with strawberry and a few bites of strawberry shortcake.  Then, somebody ate half of my tart!  *pouting ala Grumpy Cat*  Everything I ate was great and tasted just like the desserts I had in Tokyo.  They weren't busy when I went.    The only problem is this place is way too far from my house.  I can't unleash my inner 300lb self.",

While the baked goods weren't cheap at Suzuya, it was well worth the drive from the strip to visit this little hidden gem.  Oh and the customer service was top notch!",

Other things I typically love and get: iced barley tea (same as Soyo's), tiramisu dessert (discovered it from a fellow co-worker), and their cream puffs.   If you're in the area be sure to stop by and try their dessert pastries! :D",

Ive gone in 3 times looking for the strawberry crepe cake but its been sold out every time(but ill keep coming back to look). The crepes on the menu are made to order and not exactly quick... be prepared to wait especially if other people are there.    But... all that being said... the place is seriously great!  The staff is super friendly and ive never ordered anything that wasn't delicious!   Its super small so you have to expect all the other stuff.

I got a quote of $88 for a green tea cake for about 20-25 people, so I picked up a small sampler of the cakes they offer. I got their fruit cake roll and green tea cake, which cost me about $10. The cakes were not flavorful, and it lacked moistness that other bakeries like Drago sisters have. The filling was also very flavorless, it seemed like I was eating a sugar free cake made for diabetics.    Overall, I really don't understand what all the hype is about. There are better places in town, which are much cheaper and better.",

I probably came at the wrong time of the day--around 3 PM, and the selection was less than shown in the other reviews/photos here.   I bought 4 pastries, two chocolate cakes, a Kabocya chestnut Mont Blanc, and the green tea cake.  I did not eat the chocolate cake as that was for my wife.  She thought it was very, very good.  My favorite of the other two I bought for myself varied.  The Kabocya chestnut Mont Blanc was superb!  The chestnut was fantastic and the pastry cream was excellent.  I thought the green tea cake was OK but it wasn't anything special.  I do want to go back and try one of their crepes.  They were making some while I was there and they look delicious!  A word about service.  Because they were making the crepes, and two people were needed--one to watch the crepe on the griddle and one to fill them, the wait for service was a bit longer.  After a fairly long wait, a gentleman came from the baking area and started to help.  Everyone was apologetic for the wait and thanked me for my patience.  I will be coming back and trying some of their other goods.",

You would think by their appearance that they would be very heavy but both desserts were incredibly light.   The place was very clean, would be a cute place to meet up with a friend or have a date, though there is limited indoor/outdoor seating because it is a small place.

I've never had a crepe before so I do not really have something to compare it to but I got the traditional strawberries and whipped creme crepe and added kinako marshmallows and yuzu sorbet ice cream! The ice cream was a perfect touch as it was a perfect blend of hot and cold. I also had a raspberry macaron, nothing phenomenal but it tasted good!   The only thing I wish was better is the seating. There's only two tables and a little bar area against the wall the dogs about 3 people. It was pretty busy when I walked in and I had to stand in a corner because I had no other place to wait at. I basically had to ask another table if the were leaving so that I could get a table for my friend and I. Hopefully as they get more popular they'll add more seating!",

You will notice that this place is really small. I would plan ahead especially if you want to hang out with a group of friends because this place has about 5 tables with room for a dozen chairs. I would recommend getting your order to go, which I prefer. Since the takeout containers are quite neat and cute. It has this Japanese \"Kawaii\" look and feel.   The pastries were all delicious with a light taste and not overly dense like traditional European or American Style pastries. Just like many Asian inspired cafe and bakery. This place is like a combination of European inspired with Asian flare. Especially with the variety of flavors that are offered. I personally enjoyed the Blueberry Cheesecake. It was light, moist and not too sweet. However, the Japanese cheesecake was superb. Light and fluffy as if they injected air into the cake, every bite was satisfying. I will need to return so I can try their crepes!  2017 Yelp Review #42",

It's light, fluffy, and sweet what I like best is that there is no sourness to it like regular cheesecakes. My other favorite is the green tea log cake it is so light and has the perfect amount of sweetness the white chocolate praline toppings add the perfect touch to it and I love saving them for last when I eat the log cake. These two are a must have! The employees are always so kind and are helpful when you can't decide on what to get. The cafe is small but very cute and minamalist.

Each pastry speaks for themselves, they are not only pretty to look at but they are all so delicious as well.  You can never go wrong with their pate a choux (cream puffs), they offer in a variety of different flavors (green tea/matcha being my favorite) but it's not often that you can walk into a pastry shop and get a slice of mille feuille crepe cake.  Do you know how much work goes into constructing crepe cakes?!?  They are literally layers and layers of paper thin crepes, each separated with a brush of French pastry cream.  When you have a place like Suzuya that offers in so many different flavors like strawberry, matcha, tiramisu, mango, etc...you have literally hit the jackpot!   I seriously wished Suzuya was closer to home so I can order from them all the time.  Thank you for making my tummy smile with your wonderful and elegant desserts.",

Their cakes aren't too sweet, which we like. Oh, the kids love the strawberry millicrepe as well!! I just hope they will bring back their crepes soon.

I took that as a good sign and happily ordered a Mont Blanc, tiramisu, and green tea roll. My brother, my mom and I shared all three and we were delighted with our choices. The Mont Blanc was very light and airy but the frosting was for sure my favorite part. The tiramisu was quite delicious too but I've had better and I wouldn't necessarily order it again. The green tea roll was the favorite, it had a very light flavor and a delicious red bean filling. We will definitely be back to try more of their delicious selections.",

It was extremely \"light\" and delicious. I also enjoyed the tiramisu.",

Their cream puffs are so darn good that I'm craving some while I'm writing about them. Their chocolate cake is also pretty impressive. Their tiramisu is also very good. Now that I'm done complimenting this place, on to the critiques:  Personally I wasn't a huge fan of their cheesecakes. I just didn't really like the texture, but others may disagree with me. Their crepe cake is ok, but after a while the frosting can become overwhelming.   All in all, I still thoroughly enjoy the place. Ik some of my friends like their cheese cake, for example. Hope this helps!",

I hear tell that their whole cakes sell out pretty fast so if you're interested, early bird gets the worm!  Standouts: Shoyu caramel ice cream - the portion is a tiny little scoop but you totally taste the shoyu. Yuzu ice cream - ditto portion but very yuzu'y. Yuzu panna cotta - very flavorful and was a proper panna cotta Millfeuille - Was a little tough to eat but the pastry was buttery, rich and yet light at the same time. Nitro hibiscus tea - Hard to explain but if you like hibiscus tea, you have to try this. Black sesame macaron - Very black sesame-y and not overly sweet  The things we were just ok with were the cheesecake (seemed a little mild after all the other flavorful cakes), the millecrepe cakes (both green tea and strawberry) and the chocolate cake.  If you're a fan of Japanese-style pastries, you'll want to pay a visit.  Cheers!",

    "text": "I stopped by here since I've read that this is the closest to Japanese style desserts that you can get in Vegas.   I gotta say... It is TINY!!! I think there was 1 table and a few bar seating along one of the walls with 2 tables outside but in this heat there is no way I would be sitting outside. I ended up not staying to eat as the table was taken and there were already a few people sitting at the bar area. Ambiance besides the lack of seating was cute. Very very tiny....:) 4/5 service was great tho...I was greeted as soon as I walked in and as soon as I was ready to order they were right there to take it. Awesome service! 5/5  They also had a small display... And what caught my eye were the macarons....I love love love love macarons and from the looks of them they looked like they were made in house and not bought. It's a pet peeve of mine when a coffee shop/Bakeshop that sells baked goods sell macarons that are manufactured by a machine instead of being handmade. Yeah I know I'm weird. Machine made ones never have that great texture... That chew I'm looking for. The macarons there were amazing!!! Perfect crunch and that perfect chewy texture... So freaking good!! I know now where to get my macaron fix when I don't have time to make them. :) I got 4 and most of the flavors were good but the black sesame was kind of disappointing in the fact that the flavor was lacking. It was just didn't have that strong black sesame flavor that I was looking for. But texture on all of them were great! Most were 5/5.  I also got the strawberry mille feuille... This is more like Lady M's crepe cakes not a True mille feuille... And it was ok... But can I just say that I'm really over the whole pipette craze? I was amazed at how much of the strawberry jam they were able to get into it but the flavor was just not that great. It tasted like it had been sitting there for a bit. The crepes were a little on the soggy side with the top layer being a little on the tough side. 2/5  I will definitely be back... Most likely I will try something else... But the macarons... Oh yeah... I'll definitely be back for those. :)",

    "text": "The GF has been spending some time in Vegas for school, so it gives us the opportunity to explore some spots.  We stopped in here on a Saturday morning.  Like lots of things in Vegas that are not on the Strip, this is in a strip mall location.  It's got a nice, clean look inside, with dark hardwood floors, and a few tables and a narrow counter top along the front window.  The back-left portion is dominated with a display case, ordering counter, and behind that some storage and I'm guessing a kitchen.  The display cases are impressive - they've got lots of great pastries in them, definitely Japanese style (i.e. less sweet and lighter).  Presentation on the items was beautiful, and the attention to detail was very evident.  Their display case has a no pictures sign on it.  I had a tasty green tea cake, which had delicate chocolate shavings and a piece of chocolate lace on it, that had a nice airy texture and great flavor.  Coffee was interesting in that it was a pour over, but wasn't advertised as such.  Attention to detail could further be seen when they were making crepes, as they used an IR temperature gun to check the crepe surface before pouring any batter on it, and did this for each crepe they made.    In hindsight, I should have ordered a crepe as I tend to really like the Japanese-style crepes . . . definitely something I'll have to do in the future.  Definitely worth checking out if you want something that's a little lighter and less sweet, but still compliments coffee well.",

I've been here several times, and left this place happy and pleased every time. All the pastries and desserts that I've tried were delicious. Their crepes are perfect. Mont Blanc is my favorite. It's a meringue with pureed hazelnuts topped with whipped cream.  The area is a little small and there are a few tables, so it's a little uncomfortable when it's busy and you have to wait. And one more thing also ..... It's a little expensive.... But if you are a sweets fanatic like me, it's well worth shelling out the dough)))",

    "text": "I'm glad there is growth in the valley of businesses offering something different. This is the first and only Japanese pastry place. If you're a fan of Kabuto or Goyemons treats, these are the pastry chefs that created those items. For those who have never had Japanese desserts the best way to describe them is decadent, yet delicate. It's not about saccharine, sugary highs, but all about balance. Often they play on flavors that are a bit sweet, a bit savory (think green tea, red bean, sesame, etc).   I picked up some stuff to-go :   Green tea cream puff - solid cream puff. I sliced it in half and half of the cream is vanilla cream and half was nice, strong matcha flavored whip. We make some awesome cream puffs at home and I feel these are just as good.   Brandied cherry black forest - I enjoyed the chocolate mousse in this and appreciated that the cherries were brandied and not the usual neon ice cream cherries.   Yuzu panna cotta - This was bright citrusy pungent flavor that I love about yuzu and the texture was on point of a panna cotta. I get rather disappointed how unbalanced many places are between creamy and gelatine.   Tofu cheesecake - light and fluffy. I'm a big fan of Japanese style cheesecake since it's almost like a whipped mousse instead of being dense. It's one of those things that you can eat a lot of since it's not overbearing.  For the quality, the prices aren't out of line, but this isn't your cheapest bakery either. The quality though and presentation is top notch and something you would expect to see at a on strip patisserie charging for more. If you were going to a dinner party or gifting pastries, this would be one of the places to consider for being beautiful, and having unique offerings.   I will be back for crepes. It's been a long while since I've had a proper crepe. Will be making sure to stop in again when I'm on this side of town.",

    "text": "About a month ago I went to Kabuto and after I finished what had tasted like a meal sent down from the Sushi Gods of Heaven,  I was even more blessed with the perfect dessert to complete this glorious meal. It was a piece of a strawberry, crepe layered cake. A light touch of cream sandwiched between multiple thin, delicate, layers of crepes. Something that seemed so fragile and dainty, that turns into a crazy massive rave in my mouth.   Manfriend's birthday was approaching and I thought it would be really cool if I could get my hands on that cake! So I made the call to Kabuto and prayed I could somehow manage to order the cake from them. They said they wouldn't be able to do that for me, but they gave me the contact information to someone who could ;D   And DUH-DA-NA-NAAA, in came Suzuya into my life. I didn't get to reach them for the cake, but I did manage to stop by last weekend. It's located in the corner of the most random spot, and quite small. There's 2 small tables, a corner bar-type sitting area that can fit three, and 2 couches with a tiny coffee table nested in between them. Still, it's a cute little pastry cafe that looks like something I'd see in an asian drama.   I didn't get a chance to get the crepe cause I was immediately drawn to their clear glass of heavenly delights at the counter. I ordered the Strawberry Shortcake and the Green Tea Cake -- the popular choices. All their desserts are very light and fluffy, not too heavy in sugar. The Green Tea Cake pretty much tastes like Green Tea Kit Kats in cake form. I recommend pairing it with their barley tea, they compliment each other so well. The prices aren't the friendliest, they range from $3-4, but it doesn't bother me too much. Someone behind me ordered their crepe and it's definitely something I have to come back here for...I was practically drooling just creepily staring at it from afar.   Oh and as for that layered cake... it goes out fast! From what I know, they try to sell it 1-2 times a week and they sell it by the slice. If you'd like to order the whole cake, you must put in a 48hr advanced order and the price for it is around $40.",

Crepes are to die for!  It's Japanese recipe for the crepe dough) not traditional) and is really mouth watering. Pastries are also outstanding!  Biggest dilemma is what you choose, since all the items look tasty.  They offer a member card,  10th crepe is FREE. Nice addition to amazing place.",

    "text": "The locals scene in Vegas has been going through a \"renaissance\" as of late. There are more business' that are being created to appeal to the foodies, as well as the uniqueness that this city has to offer, with its diverse clientele. This has to be the most unique pastry shop in all of Vegas. They specialize in Asian (particularly Japanese) style pastries. I've been here many times, having tried almost all the sweets here, and most of the items I have tried have been fantastic. This time, I came here with a bunch of yelpers at  Nelson's UYE event.  Suzuya is located behind the Jiffy Lube in a strip mall, off of the 215 and Durango, heading west. You'll see the sign \"pastries and crepes\" off the road, and turn in there.  (if you went past the Sonic Drive Thru, you've gone too far). The parking lot is shared with the other business', but I have never had trouble finding a spot to park.  Once going in, I was immediately greeted by Chef Misuzu and her staff. The pastry chef Misuzu has had an impressive career, working in some of the best 5 Star 5 Diamond establishments including Alex at the Wynn, and the Aria Resort. And if her green tea cake looks familiar to you all, before opening up her own shop, she was also the pastry chef of the Mon restaurant group (Kabuto, Goyemon, Sushi Mon).  There are tables set up with chairs and wooden benches. This store is kept immaculate. On the service counter there are crepe machines, pastry display cases, a drink station, and a register. Over near the crepe machines, there is a list of crepes that you can order. Don't forget to look above the pastry display case, there are apple pies and tarts available. Order from the display case. Next to the pastries is a refrigerated case, where they keep cold drinks, many of them Japanese made, available. After ordering, I sat down and let them deliver my goods too me, since there was a big line.   (Note: While Misuzu keeps a lot of customer favorites in stock, she also changes up her desserts, showcasing the seasonality of her pastries, her creativity and the team)  Anmitsu - This popular japanese dessert is one we don't see very often in America. Suzuya's version uses an agar jelly, red beans, fresh fruits, and tofu mochi which gives it a nice chew. I liked the caramel syrup you can pour on top, and it goes well with green tea ice cream.   Apple Pie - Wow, what a great take on a classic. This one uses a puff pastry-like crust, giving it a extremely flaky texture. The fuji apples used hold their shape well, and the entire dessert is well balanced. Make sure to ask for it warmed, with a scoop of vanilla ice cream.  Tofu Cheesecake - This was probably my least favorite item. While the cheesecake was light and properly made, for my personal preference, it was hard for my palette to get this one, from the tofu. But, others' liked it, so who am I to say?  Rum Raisin Shortbread Sandwich - These little treats were quite delectable. Crumbly, buttery, sable biscuit sandwiches with rum raisins. The filling was sort of a buttercream, but denser and less buttery, I couldn't figure out what it was, but it was terrific.  B.A.T. (Bourbon Bacon, Arugula, and Sun Dried Tomatoes) Crepe - Even If you're not a big fan of desserts, I urge you to come and try the crepe's at Suzuya, whether sweet or savory ones. These are phenomenal. It is safe to say that the crepe shells themselves.. the best in Vegas. They are sturdy enough to hold the fillings, but once you eat them, they melt in your mouth, letting the fillings shine. This savory crepe is made with bourbon bacon, arugula, avacado, and sun dried tomatoes. All the flavors go extremely well together, and balance out each other. It kept me interested, and wanting more. I could eat 12!!!  I like good pastries... and I LOVE great pastries. Suzuya is a great pastry shop, with a fantastic staff, wonderful food, and a comfortable setting. They are open 10am - 6, every day except Tues. Come try this place out, I am sure you will enjoy it as much as I have.",

This was good...just don't expect super sugary sweet american apple pie (Most Japanese desserts are tame in comparison)!  I admit, I mostly bought it because it looked cool LOL  Also tried the Yuzu Panna Cotta ($3.75): Japanese Citrus with Yogurt. This was pretty tasty...the Yuzu is a very strong flavor though and overpowers everything else in the panna cotta. Gotta love yuzu to love this!   I took some Mini Green Tea Creme Puffs ($1.80ea) to go...brought these home but forgot about them, and they went bad...such a waste!   I'll stop by again to try their Crepes!  Pics! :",

Top it off with ice cream and it's perfect.  I've also tried their mango tart and the banana cream tart.  That crust is baked so perfectly and the fruits are always fresh.

The prices are similar to what you'd find in Southern California, around $3.50-$5 for the larger desserts and around $2 for the cream puffs and macaron.   I got the green tea and red bean cake that everyone has been raving about and the coconut chiffon cake. The green tea cake was lighter than most western style cakes and had a very faint matcha taste. In between the layers was a red bean frosting which was really flavorful and grainy in texture. I was hoping for a stronger green tea flavor from the cake but the matcha frosting on top was really strong and delicious. Too bad there wasn't more of it. Overall a delicious cake, especially for red bean lovers but not enough green tea. It was around 4.25  The coconut chiffon cake was heavenly. It was the best chiffon and/or coconut cake I've had in my life! It was so fluffy and light, like a cloud, and not overly sweet at all. The coconut flakes weren't too hard either. I wish I ate a whole cake. This is a must try, especially for just $3.60!",

After the cake delivery, we had to go back to get some goodies and wow! Just the lightest of cakes and not those cloying sweet frostings and embellishments so many bakeries make. The crepes were divine nd the cream puffs addictive. This is hands down our bakery choice in Las Vegas.  ONO!",

There was still a good selection of desserts. I got an assortment of goodies to try out: strawberry crepe cake, coffee jelly, green tea cake, monte blanc, Tokyo cake, and the pannacotta...my favorite amongst those were the coffee jelly complete with creamer on the side and strawberry crepe cake (which by the way had this little vial thingy stuck on it with strawberry sauce to squeeze in top of the cake)! I love how their desserts are tasty and not overly sweet...just perfect! I would definitely go back to try out the other desserts.

First thing I noticed was the place is quite small. Other than that it is decorated nicely. CUSTOMER SERVICE OUTSTANDING!  I ordered the Nutella & Almond Crepe with Strawberries and Bananas added. I also ordered a side cup of Vanilla ice cream. The icecream cup is smaller than I expected but I was actually happy because on a diet I shouldn't be indulging in icecream of all things! lol the crepe was smaller in portion compared to Tasty Crepes but also a cheaper price.   It was really good and I definitely would eat here again!!   Nice price and it was really good.",

I'm a fan of light desserts but these hardly had any taste in any of it. I also got a Yuzu Panna cotta which was quite the opposite... So overly flavorful/tart, I couldn't eat it.

It is very flavorful and you can taste the freshness of their products. Their macaroons are delicious I think my son may be addicted to them now. It was my first time at this place and this is now on my top list. Their customer service is amazing too, very pleasant lady explained to me orders were taken 2 days in advance (it was too late for me to place an order because I needed it for the next day) however she explained how could I still get a cake the next day and so I did come the next day as soon as they opened. It just shows they really care and know how to run a business. Consider me a new customer.",

I have been here more than a few times now over the years, it's a bit far from my house so I don't come as often as I would like but I would drive this far if the craving hits!  The matcha crepe cake is always delicious, strong match flavor, crepe is soft and smooth, so flavorful but also so light. I tried a few of their cakes and desserts, never disappointed. Recently tried the coconut chiffon cake and OH LORD! I love coconut, anything coconut I will try but this cake takes the prize! Tons of coconut shavings on the outside, soft and fluffy cake on the inside with a little coconut cream...coconut heaven!   The chocolate cake is always really good, the berry crepe cake, pretty much all of their desserts are on point! Certain cake can be a bit pricy but for the quality of what you get, it is awesome!",

I grew up eating Japanese desserts and in Las Vegas, Suzuya has been the only place so far that is up to par with the quality and the flavor of what I am used to. I have tried many of their dessert selections and have been completely satisfied with them all. The ones that stand out to me are the coconut chiffon cake and the custard with the fruit. Their desserts are not overly sweet which I appreciate and the fruits that they use seem to be sweet and never sour.   They are a bit on the pricier end but I would rather spend my money here where I know I am getting the best. The workers are very kind as well. I bought about five items one time, and they threw in an extra cake! I was very happy.   I truly recommend this place. Their desserts are amazing.",

The creme is perfect, not too sweet and the taste of the crepe itself is just sweet enough.  I guess I had to subtract a star because I've made my own standard crepes before and I know how cheap and easy it is to make them, so to pay around $10 for two is difficult though they are way better than my own.  Also, people rave about the crepe cake which is strawberry creme layered between maybe 10 crepes and cut like a cake...had it once...it's ok, but the much better item is just a freshly made strawberry and creme crepe.

    "text": "I really wanted to like this place since there was so many rave reviews. Sadly, it fell short of my expectations. I came here more than once and tried out many different items before I decided to write this review.   This is a cute little place that looks clean and crisp, with a few chairs and tables. Everyone here is super friendly so I would give it a thumbs up for great customer service. However, what disappointment me was the food. I had expected more.   Mille crepe cake- I question if this one is fresh. It was slightly sticky, dense, and lacked flavor. It had a slight weird spongy texture and taste. I had a hard time getting through it with a fork. Maybe the crepe cakes from Lady M in New York City has set the bar too high (layers of decadence that is flavorful yet not too sweet) but this one just didn't come close.   Crepe w/ strawberries and whipped cream + 1 scoop of green tea ice cream- This one is probably the best thing I had here. I actually enjoyed eating this crepe. The green tea ice cream here tasted way better than my green tea cake. This one I would recommend eating when coming here.    Green tea cake- I love my green tea. I drink it on a daily basis. I eat all kinds of cakes or desserts with green tea. I love azuki beans too. So with the combo, I was looking forward to trying this. But this one tasted a hint too bitter and the azuki beans actually tasted a bit weird with the green tea. The green tea, azuki beans cream, and the chocolate brought together a flavor that was actually weird and unpleasant. A hint too much of artificial flavoring. I took 2 bites and I was done.   Mont Blanc (chestnut)- The best part is that chestnut on top. But the rest wasn't all too exciting. It had too much cream. The chestnut flavor tasted too artificial. I thought it tasted weird and nothing like chestnut flavor.    Strawberry shortcake- Not sure what is the hype with this one. I thought it was decent. It just taste like a strawberry cake.   Amount spent: Around $25.   Overall, I think their crepes are pretty good. Everything else, I would probably skip. The customer service here is great. Everything looks really cute. I like the box they placed the cakes in.   Would I come here again? Maybe when I'm having a crazy crepe craving and happen to be in the neighborhood...",

I decided to try their whole bean coffee a try, in other 3 cafe shops where I bought my other coffee bag from, they always offer complimentary brew coffee with any coffee bean purchase, but Suzuya doesn't do it.  I mean, how much does it cost them to just brew a coffee, especially for regular customers? also, the price written on their coffee bag and on their board are different, on the coffee bag it says $13, but on the board it says $15, when I asked why the difference in price they said the cheaper price is for wholesale price, maybe they should consider update the price on the bag so it doesn't confuse the customer.

Suzuya only makes strawberry or green tea layered cakes (or crepe or mille-feuille) in limited quantity (and they don't make them daily). This special treat can always be special ordered per customer request.  All Japanese style pastries here are light with just right amount of sweetness. My favorites are layered cake, green tea cake, banana cream pie and cream puff. I also special ordered my mom's 60th birthday cake from Suzuya.(my mom's fav flavor - green tea with chestnut)  Pastry chef did a wonderful job on the decoration! My cake came out beautiful and very delish. Although, Suzuya is in the other side of town from my house, It is totally worth the drive to go there once a while and fix my sweet craving!",

I have gone about 3 times now, and every experience has been a delightful one. The cashiers are very nice and answer any questions you may have about the sweets. They also make suggestions if you can't decide. Interior of the place is very clean and hip. Everything is moderately priced from $3-5 dollars per item for the pastries. I usually get about 4-5 items to go each time I go in. The to-go boxes are absolutely adorable and well made, you don't have to worry about to go items getting messed up or smashed.   I got 5 items around Mothers Day, and my mom thought I had paid well over 50 dollars for everything just because how nice the box was and how professional the pastries looked. Unfortunately, I had to burst her bubble, and tell her I had only spent $17 on everything. She loved everything I had gotten her thankfully.   One thing I always suggest: Tofu Cheesecake! It is my absolute favorite!",

I was back twice in one week, that says a lot. I was heading over to Julie T's place to see the new baby, and I needed to bring something, I was trying to be sneaky and surprise her (and then I saw she already wrote a review) so my plan was foiled. I originally had planned to get an entire coconut chiffon cake, but then decided to buy one of everything so that way we could all try a sample of each. Wow, when we opened the box of treasures, it was like opening a present. We all passed around the desserts, and all you could here was \"mmmmm\" and \"OMG\" we couldn't help ourselves. I really couldn't tell you what my favorite was, as they all were so good. I still thinking about the Mille-Crepe and the Yuzu Panna Cotta as well as the Mont Blanc. Surprisingly, the Green Tea Cake was my least favorite, just didn't get me like the rest of them did.   Definitely coming back for the Kobocha pie and I need to try the crepes if I can get passed the other pastries first!",

    "text": "My wife and myself have been meaning to sample menu items and write our review of this business for quite some time. Something always somehow seemed to interrupt our schedule and postpone our visit. Living on the strip makes its location somewhat out of our normal routines and travel. Persistence has its rewards though. Our arrival was approximately 2:00 PM. We were welcomed immediately as were other customers who came in while we were there. This gem though quaint and off the beaten path holds some surprisingly, luscious, treats for those accustomed to traditional bakery fare. Cleanliness is immediately evident accompanied with a warmness to your spirit. Looking in the crystal clear display case were many inviting, delicious looking offerings that would tempt and be almost irresistible to one even following a  most rigid diet. We purchased three selections but wanted extras. A slice of coconut chiffon cake, a banana, chocolate, whipped cream crepe, and one anco bean cream puff.  All were heavenly enjoyable, light, refreshing, very satisfying without any overpowering of the usual sugar sweetness. Exquisite would  be a good expression for a discriminating critic. The owner(S) and staff have excelled in their execution of talent in pastries and cakes. I would recommend any of their delights a pairing with Dolce Far Niente. Delicious late harvest wine. Total wine stocks  this at 77.00 . This is 375 ml- (12.6 OZ) with 2 to 3 ounce serving per person . If you are of no price concern then Chateau d'yquem  of course is the supreme compliment. For us we anticipate our return for more of these scrumptious, enchanting and pleasing yummies. You won't regret your indulgence of their delectable treats should you be so fortunate to visit there. Alright, for all you cowboys and cowgirls--Yeehaw!",

My favorite sweet crepe is the apricot because the apricots are soft and warm with a vanilla filling inside. Rum and raisin macaron flavors takes me back to childhood. Chocolate cake AND strawberry shortcake is the best cake I have EVER have. I would definitely recommend buying a special occasion dessert or cake from here. Quality ingredients. Talent is truly exceptional.   Restaurant is clean but there are not a lot of seats so I take mine to go. I get really irritated though because if I choose to eat there and take some home separately - they make me do two different transactions even when they are holding on to the product. The ladies in the front have major trust issues and aren't the best communicators. The opening hours suck! Don't expect ever to pop in to have something with your morning coffee. It only makes me angry because I want their goodies all the time!",

After browsing online and reading all the positive reviews, I decided to go for it. Their website is very clear and organized with good descriptions and pictures of all their cakes. Unfortunately, the only negative thing for me was that the Tokyo Cheesecake only comes in one size. Because I had a large party to serve, I ended up picking two cakes. I called in and ordered a Tokyo cheesecake and Strawberry Shortcake and just hoped that I made a good choice.   When I got there, I ordered an iced coffee which tasted AMAZING. I highly recommend if you are a coffee lover. I also love the detail of their strong plastic personalized coffee cup. Anyways, I saw everyone eating their house-made custard pulin so I decided to get one of those too. It was really good, the perfect amount of sweetness and reminded me of a Taiwanese pudding that I love, but better because it was freshly made. There were so many other desserts that I really wanted to get like the yuzu panna cotta and their mille crepe cakes but I'll just have to come back at some point.   Both the cakes I ordered were delicious. Fresh, light and beautifully decorated. Everyone loved it. The location is a little far from the strip but it's totally worth it if you are looking for a quality Japanese style cake that is light and not super sweet. Can't wait to come back!  Tips: - If there is something you specifically want, call ahead to check if they have any. Seasonal pastries sell out especially fast! - No wifi.",

They were just the right amount of chewy on outside & fkavorful inside. I also ordered Yuzu custard. A very small serving & super sour. It tasted more like yogurt.  The other custard I ordered tasted like flan with a more gelatinous texture. I was kinda dissapointed on selection and value of pastries.",

They offer custard puffs, macaroons, fruit tarts, etc. their custard puffs were all so tasty. You can't go wrong with their flavors. They had a new mango tart and it was soooo delicious. The freshness of the mango was to die for. Overall I highly recommend this place either to get some goodies to go or sit down and catch up with a friend. Adequate seating with good parking",

I love the way the shop looks and how cute all the pastries are. They are so yummy and look so delicious. I love having their desserts. I have yet to have a crepe, but hopefully soon!  My favorite dessert would have to be one of the crepe cakes or the special of the day they had once. It was a raspberry mousse with a bavarian creme on the bottom topped with mixed berry and a jello consistency type thing.  There are so many different desserts that I want to try! It was so good and I can say that I will be there over and over again!",

The store itself is contemporary and small.  There is seating for maybe 18-20 people.  It looks like they offer a very basic coffee and tea, and the stars of the show are the fancy pastries in a small case. They do have high chairs for the kiddos.   $6.22 got me a mont blanc and a cream puff for my boy.  My boy was thoroughly impressed with his cream puff and the mont blanc was delicious as it was beautiful.  I had always wondered what the little yellow thing on top was.  I had imagined it was maybe an apricot or a candied peach but no...it was a chestnut I think.   My favorite part about the visit was the girl behind the counter.  She was adorable.  When I handed her my card she reached for it with both hands and then handed it back with both hands.  She arranged my items on a small tray, stepped back and took a look, and then re-arranged the items on the tray.  How thoughtful and utterly cute.",

I've been coming here for the past few years and always order cakes for any occasion. I wish they changed up their menu every once in a while, but they do usually create a new pastry for holidays. The crepes are also delicious but my favorite would be the BAT savory crepe which includes bacon, arugula, dried tomatoes, avocado, and mayo. It's also pretty filling so perfect for breakfast or even brunch. Definitely would recommend anyone in the southwest area!",

I am ruined because I can never eat apple pie any other way now :)  The apples were not mushy at all and they warmed it up upon request and with a scoop of vanilla Ice cream you are set!   My newest crush is the custard served in a glass jar. Silky smoothness with a liquid caramel ending.  Eat it chilled and you are sure to be addicted.   They also make all their ice creams so feel free to build your own crepe or order one of their specialties like my favorite \"Rocky Road\" which consists of ice cream chocolate sauce, house made marshmallow and a pocky stick or try once with fresh strawberries whip cream, and green tea ice cream. They also have delicious savory ones too. The place is cute and small and the service is always with a smile!",

Reminds me of the famous Halekulani coconut cake in Honolulu!!  strawberry shortcake - Hmm the cream is good!!

It was just cake with frosting on top. Taste was great.  -egg pudding (forgot name) tasted like delicious flan in a cup 5/5   Hubby got eclair and ate it before I could sample.   One thing I wish for is for the dessert to be on a plate. It was a served on a serving platter? I wasn't sure if that was the plate. But it was a little awkward to eat on with the ridges on the serving platter.   Also, bit of a pain to not accept bills over $20. I can't say I know any other place I go to with those rules.",

Selections were limited in the afternoon, but I see that as a good sign. No waste, everything is fresh. We selected the chocolate cake, regular cream puff and the coffee jelly. Portions are small, so you don't have to feel guilty about trying several. Cake was good, my son gobbled it up. The cream puff was perfect. Light, and the cream inside .... I could eat that by the bowlful. But our favorite was the coffee jelly. Pour on the cream and take a bite, it is the most delicate gel and the coffee flavor is so delicious. No bitterness . Just perfect coffee. It left me wanting more . Will definitely be back.",

    "text": "3.5 stars. I just rounded it up to 4.  What a cute little bakery store! I first came upon this store when I was searching around on yelp and found out that they had mille crepe cakes! I sincerely missed the mille crepe cake I had in NY and I wanted to visit Suzuya to see if their crepe cakes were any similar to the ones I had in NY.   The first time I visited was last month and I went right in the morning. However, they did not have the crepe cake out :( They said they were still making it. I was quite sad that I couldn't try it out on my first visit. Instead, I opted for a piece of their strawberry shortcake and my friend got one of their savory crepes as breakfast.   The strawberry shortcake was okay. For some reason, there was something missing . It didn't make me go \"eeeeee!\" as most other good pastries do. It was light and fluffy like most Japanese/French fusion bakeries are but not AS fluffy as it can be? Not really sure how to describe it. But my friend's savory crepe was pretty good. I think he got the B.A.T. Very nicely put together. Nothing too overpowering or overwhelming.   On my second visit to Suzuya, they didn't even make the mille crepe cake for that day. I was highly disappointed and ended up not taking anything else in substitution.  Finally, on my third visit to Suzuya, I got to try their strawberry mille crepe cake. While my friends got a Mont Blanc, Yuzu Panna Cotta, and Coffee Jelly.   I wasn't that impressed with their mille crepe cake. One of the things that I noticed was that they put the mille crepe cake in the fridge along with their other pastries. I suppose for other pastries, it's okay. But a mille crepe cake's main ingredient is the cream between each layer of crepe. Once that hits the fridge, it hardens and is not as soft. Same could be said for the crepe itself -- it gets a little stretchy and no longer as fresh. The texture and the feeling of taking a bite of the crepe cake was not satisfying. I think it would be better if they left the cake out of the fridge.   The mille crepe cake I had in NY was left out. Think bakery. They never put it in a fridge. They served the cake fresh most of the time because there's a lot of people that buy it. High turn over rate. However, I did put the cake in the fridge while staying in NY and even though it hit the fridge, the cake's quality didn't change much ... ehh? Quality difference?  However, I really enjoyed their Mont Blanc, which is a chestnut dessert. It has chestnut surrounding it, cake on the inside, and a tart holding it all together. It was really good. Probably the best dessert out of the 4 that we got.  The Yuzu panna cotta was okay. The yuzu was very prominent in the dessert. It was good, but not the type of citrus I liked :P And I never got to try the coffee jelly considering I'm not a big coffee person.   I do want to try more of their desserts to see how they taste. It seems like they always have new items to choose from. Some are part of their basic menu while others constantly change, such as the mango tiramisu or seasonal mango desserts.",

I snagged the Coconut Chiffon Cake, Panna Cotta and the Fruit Tart. I could not wait to get home and try them all! As I was heading out the door my eye caught the list of crepes and I knew I would have to give those a go another time. Each dessert was light which was exactly what I was going for. And the flavor was incredible for each! Creamy, silky goodness! I was thoroughly impressed considering their location was in a random parking lot next to a nail salon and a Jiffy Lube. And I've been living 2 miles away for almost 3 years and never thought to stop in. I already cannot wait to go back. And the employees were very nice and never made me feel like I was being pushed out the door even thought I came in close to closing time. Heavenly treats I will be back for.",

The small shop only has seating for a dozen people with the bulk of the floor space devoted to the display cases and kitchen (everything is made on-site).  Since I was there after 5pm, there weren't a lot of items left, but I still snagged an apple pie, a piece of chocolate cake, and a piece of strawberry shortcake.  The thing I most appreciated about my items was that they were not too sweet.  While I am a fan of sugar and buttercream and frosting, I do enjoy tasting the actual ingredients in my baked goods.  The Fuji apples in my little pie were well-spiced and bursting with flavor, providing great textural contrast to the pastry.  Both the chocolate cake and the shortcake featured alternating layers of cream filling and delicate cake; in addition, the robust dark chocolate shavings on the chocolate cake provided tooth resistance and melted satisfyingly on my tongue.  I could taste the quality of the ingredients and the care lovingly put into the products.  Service was friendly and I was thanked for coming in to visit.  How nice!",

It started when I just wanted to grab a quick cup of coffee without having to go all the way to Starbucks.  I live in walking distance of this spot so it was very convenient.  While waiting to get my drink, I watched as the guy ahead of me ordered a strawberry-filled crepe that looked and smelled delicious.  My olfactory sense made a mental note and I knew I'd have to make a return trip.  I ended up never even getting a crepe but tried a personal-sized Fuji Apple Pie instead. Lemme tell you when I say, I'm literally a slave to them now.  I find it very hard to resist swerving into the shopping center to check in to Suzuya to see if that wonderful pastry delight is sitting there calling me like a Siren to indulge in its culinary wonderment.  In the last two weeks or so, I've had about 3 or 4.  I even ordered a full-sized one for Thanksgiving and literally prayed that no one would touch it before the night was over.  THANKFULLY, my prayers were answered and I was able to devour the pie all by myself over a course of a few days since Thanks.  (Try it with butter pecan ice cream and you'll be in heaven!)  I just recently tried the Pumpkin Pie and now I'm torn between which is my fave...so I just buy them both. :)   The folks that work at Suzuya are sweet, polite and incredibly gracious providing the kind of hospitality that you only get overseas.  Just going inside, I'm transported to a place and world I've never been to but would now love to visit--Japan!  I count myself a a proud patron of this establishment and wish them all the success in the world.  I'm contemplating stopping by even as I type this... :::grabs keys:::",

I don't recall the pastry specifically because I really enjoyed the custard since it was so well balanced, not overly sweet or too rich. Good portion size as I don't fancy the giant ones you might be familiar with from a certain franchise.   Blueberry cheesecake was light and fluffy with a slight sour cream undertone.

    "text": "Fantastic sweet pastries and crepes! I think that's how you translate their name, anyway. I don't know Japanese.  Their immense reputation certainly precedes them, and I've probably even tried one of their creations at Goyemon a long time ago. But even knowing I would almost certainly enjoy Suzuya, I wasn't motivated to make the drive out until a timely UYE that followed the nearby monthly Chaiya Food Fair today. I'm so, so glad that I finally went.  I ordered the B.A.T. - bourbon bacon, arugula, tomatoes, avocado, house-made mayo, balsamic vinaigrette, all wrapped in a great, almost spongy crepe. This is by far the best savory crepe I've had, and I'd recommend it as a \"meal\" to precede all your desserts. In terms of sweets, I had a banana-hazelnut cream tart, which I almost absent-mindedly started eating before realizing how good it was. And my other dessert order, a mango mousse, was topped with diced mango and a coconut-dang-it-what's-the-word-Nelson-used? and was heavenly all the way through.  I was also lucky enough to try what Michael K. ordered. I actually started off on those, first taste being a nice piece of apple pie that he requested to be topped with green tea ice cream. To make this delight, they use puff pastry and fuji apple, two of my favorites, and it's quite possibly the best apple pie you'll find around Vegas. I believe that I described this as \"really, really good.\"  I also tasted a bit of a custard atop a thin layer of sponge cake, which was also very good, and practically half a cannoli crepe, which was not overly sweet but still a treat with the ricotta cheese, crunchy pistachio bits and semi-sweet chocolate pieces. Finally, I tried a green tea eclair with a white chocolate topping, and I almost could have had the white chocolate with that touch of green tea powder by itself.  I have a few more treats in my fridge waiting for me to recover from the food coma, and I'm confident that I'll enjoy those as well. (UPDATE 4/30/14: custard pudding awesome, yuzu panna cotta relatively restrained on yuzu flavor.) I won't qualify my recommendation with \"sweets\" or whatever: Suzuya is a must-try, period.",

I heard about this place through a friend who lives close by and read the some reviews, so  I was delighted to see if I can take my sweet tooth craving for a spin. It's cute a little shop and has a pleasant atmosphere, and the staff are nice people too.  I ordered the Mango, Passion Fruit & Coconut Mousse, its unbelievably delicious, I could taste the layers of fruit and surprisingly it wasn't too sweet. I'm a fan strawberries so I had to try the Strawberry Mille Crepe Cake, its stacked crepes formed into a cake, I like this better than any strawberry shortcake.      I love Japanese Milk, tastes like black tea except its cold.  I found out you can buy the powder but I prefer to buy it from a can.  I'm thoroughly impressed with this bakery, I'll definitely be returning back.  .",

The place felt very comfy and relaxing. Furthermore, the DESSERTS were PALATABLE !!!!  All of the desserts I tried were perfect in sweetness and not overbearing! The presentation for each pastry was exquisite and if you chose to dine in, the dish is accompanied with gold eating utensils. One dish that's worth a mention is the Yuzu Pana Cotta. A miniature dish that PACK-A-PUNCH. It hits with a strong citrus flavor which go hand in hand with a sour jell that sets your taste buds in a frenzy!",

Gotta say, happy I finally found one and close to home.   The crepe was delicious and not too sweet, which is even better. Fresh strawberries and a really creative way of assembling it.  Got to watch them make it from.the start and I was quite impressed. We also tried the eclairs and mini chocolate puffs, delicious!!  The service wasn't amongst the best considering nobody said hello when we walked in even though there were two people working up front, the guy that helped us didn't seem happy at all and we had to wait literally 12 minutes for our crepe AND we were the only ones in the place.   Good thing their pastries and crepes are yumm!!",

You're greeted as you walk in and if there is a customer taking their time with their order in front of you the workers apologize for the waiting time which honestly I didn't even mind. They're so friendly and work really hard to explain and describe the food, drinks and pastries. They recognized us right away the second time we went in and patiently waited for us to make up our minds with our order :) The fresh crepes are delicious! We tried both sweet and savory crepes and we were so satisfied! The pastries were amazinggg! From macarons to millicrepes and even the fluffy Tokyo cheesecake! Their tea options surprised me and the way they serve them in the tilt cups is so cute! Salutes to them for the loose leaf teas. Their coffee is smooth and we didn't even need much cream or sugar :) Overall, obviously I love this place and I'll definitely be giving them my business every and anytime I get the chance because I don't even live around the area, haha! :)   Omg wait let's not forget the ambience of the place! Decorated very nicely and the relaxing jazz music is a huuuuuge plus!!",

Another such themed cafe, at least in Las Vegas, would probably muck up their menu with gross artificial boba teas and such, but not this place. Everything is seriously delicious.    One quibble: They serve cold brewed coffee and tea that has specially sources beans etc. etc. Basically they seem to care about their coffee and tea. Then, if you want creamer, they only offer those gross dinner cafe creamer things that aren't even made of cream but instead weird chemicals and vegetable oil. Organic specialty brew with bizarre chemical fake dairy product? Just a small detail that could be corrected.",

They have small selection to choose from (I'm guessing I should get to the bakery earlier for better selection) but the quality is definitely there and visible. We have tried the strawberry shortcake, mango mousse cake, green tea cake roll, and custard pudding. All were delicious!! I have finally found the place that serves Japanese style flan and it is amazing~ Every visit will include one of the custard puddings for sure.  On another visit we had blueberry cheesecake and tiramisu. Personally I did not like the blueberry cheesecake but that was my preference (my boyfriend loved it). The tiramisu, extremely good.  I have yet to try the crepes but they are definitely on the to-eat list.  All in all, wonderful Japanese style pastries. I will be here often and have decided I need to try every dessert they offer!",

Green tea roulade (not pictured because our 2nd time here we couldn't wait for a pic) came in 2nd. It had some candied nuts on the outside and moist cake and redbean & green tea goodness on the inside.   The green tea crepecake was about 13layers...similar filling as the roulade but I got bored with it after a couple bites. Chestnut Mont Blanc was next...if you like the sweet beany, nutty taste of a chestnut get this.  Cheesecake was good, not impressive. Black sesame macaroon(not pictured) was too chewy, I like it on the lighter more delicate, melt in your mouth side.  That being said I'm not quite sure what a macaroon should taste like.   Get the pour coffee! It was strong and went well with all the desserts.",

The place was pretty busy, but luckily that gave me ample time to peruse the display case and figure out what I wanted to order. I couldn't resist the strawberry crepe cake and a red bean cream puff for my fella.   The ordering and payment process is very convenient and I was out the door in minimal time with my adorable little box of desserts. I made it as far as my car before I was compelled to take a bite of the crepe cake. Holy cow! It was absolutely amazing. The flavors were so subtle and yet explosive. The flavors were right on and I can't believe it took me as long as it did to give them a try. I don't have much of a sweet tooth, but this place truly blew my mind. Not overly sweet and the all-natural flavors really shown.   I heard after the fact that the crepe cake is hard to come by, only making me wish I had bought more than one when I had the chance. Have no fear, I will be back... and soon.",

We made the trek over there before their flight back home because they wanted to bring some goodies back as souvenirs. There is ample parking in the lot in front of Suzuya. The dessert cafe is very cute and comfortable, just as it would belong in a cute-sy cafe in Japan. My sister asked for two pieces of the cheesecake to go. The lady at the register offered to-go ice packs for the cakes when she found out my sister was taking it onto the place. I thought that was very thoughtful and considerate. Each ice pack costs 50 cents. We ordered the strawberry milli cake to eat there. The milli cake came with a syringe filled with strawberry jam along a set of gold plated utensils. My sister asked for an extra set of utensils for her to-go order, but the lady denied us. I found this to be fairly strange as the utensils were plastic. They weren't real gold or anything close it. As we stuck our fork into the crepe cake, the fork would not let go. The cake was very thick and chewy--an odd consistency for cake. We needed a knife to free up the cake from the fork. Would I come here again, definitely not! Unbookmarked this place as we were leaving the cafe.",

I ordered a cake for thanksgiving and was supposed to pick it up a day before the thanksgiving, but got caught up at work. I called them to inform that I cannot get out of work on time to get the cake, and that I will come to get it the next day (they were open until lunch). The cake was already paid for. I was told that it is impossible, that they cannot give me my cake or a refund the next day. I spoke to the manager, and asked a reason why they cannot give me my prepaid cake before. All I got in response was: \"it's our policy, u get it today or get it at all.\" I ordered cakes from other bakeries and none of them would take advantage of their customers like that, they would happily save the prepaid cake so you can get it a day or two later. But suzuya will resell your prepaid cake the next day because \"it's their policy\", needless to say will never give them my business again.",

From Tokyo Cheesecake to Strawberry Shortcake, and a variety of crepe cakes to their mont blonc, there is something for everyone to enjoy.  It's a quaint space nestled in a small shopping center next to Sonic on Durango and Warm Springs in the Southwest part of town. It's a smaller spot, but there's a coziness to it that is endearing. They offer desserts and coffee, although the coffee is nothing special. What I love about their dessert is that they are as delicious as they are beautifully prepared and presented. You can. Goose to buy by the slice, or they have a. Variety of premade whole cakes ready to go. Otherwise, they take special orders. My favorite thing to get is their original creme puff. The batter is fluffy and airy, and the filling is of real custard and real whipped cream that are both so good and flavorful! They usually come in two sizes and have a variety of flavors from their original to strawberry, and green tea to anko.  From time to time, they have seasonal offerings too, and by far, their best has been their Daifuku Mochi. This is the only place in Vegas I've come across that sells Daifuku Mochi! It's seriously the best dessert I've ever put in my mouth, as there are so many layers to enjoy from the fresh mochi down to the cold strawberry in the middle. Be sure to check out their menu and photos of their offerings. Also, check out their Instagram as they are pretty good at posting what they have readily available for the day, including any seasonal items.",

I have yet to find anywhere that beats out SUZUYA cakes.   The first time I had this cake, my brother ordered it for my daughter's second birthday; a delicious Strawberry shortcake. And ever since I have been hooked. The cake is so fluffy... cream looks just like creamy velvet clouds. Did I mention the millie crepe cakes are mouthwatering as well? They kind of have this melt in your mouth taste.   Today I stopped in because I have been dying for some cake. It's the holidays and gosh darn who needs to worry about their diet. I ordered a variety of their cake selection. Strawberry shortcake, strawberry millie cake, green tea and red bean cake, oh and some cute reindeer cream puffs (for the kid). Dare to say I ate almost all of it in one day.... just kidding I did share. But True that we did finish everything in a day.  Everything here is so heavenly. I definitely will not be buying cakes anywhere else. And it's True. I've gotten my daughter's birthday cake from here every year for three years now and my son is hitting two cakes with them. Definitely order ahead if you are needing a cake since the ones in their display seems to sell out. Speaking of which.... time to place an order.   I'm seeing some previous reviews about service. I personally have never ran into bad service here. Every time I have gone, it's been a pleasant Japanese lady working front. She's so quick and efficient. Love it!  Anyways the cakes are a bit pricey and the location is a bit easy to pass. You definitely don't want to miss the chance to try it out though!!",

Their website is very clear and organized with great descriptions and pictures of all their cakes looks amazing.   We ordered ~  1) Yuzu Panna Cotta  Yuzu, a refreshing Japanese citrus, flavored yogurt panna cotta.  $3.75  it wasn't panna cotta that we are used to but it was sour and tasty.  2) Chocolate Cream Puff mini  Dark chocolate cream inside with dark chocolate decoration on top  $1.35  It was ok, the perfect amount of sweetness.  3) Custard Pulin   Highest quality vegetarian hen egg custard, with dark caramel sauce on the bottom.  $4.00  This is my fave. Delicious, fresh, and light.  4)Passion Fruit Macaron   Passion fruit butter cream and passion pate de fruit  $2.50/each  This is really good too!",

If you show up early you can take home a full cake, in case you need a last minute birthday cake. Or they have a large assortment of single-serving treats.  The chocolate cake is delicate and flavorful without being overpowering. The textures are incredible with the soft fluffiness of the cake and the little bits of crunch in the topping. The yuzu panna cotta is light and citrusy, one of my favorites.  Suzuya is a gem!!",

It was Christmas Eve and he arrived 30 minutes before doors opened and was the second person in line.  He mentioned that the line got much longer, also they didn't have many cakes to sell since they had a lot of orders due to the holiday.  So happy with his selection, the cake itself was delicious even though the strawberries was a tad bit overly tart.",

    "text": "Suzuya is a quaint Japanese style patisserie offering a wide variety of delicious and visually simple yet well crafted pastries and cakes year-round along with special seasonal items. It is a place to sample some of the finest flavors of French-inspired Japanese desserts in the Las Vegas valley.  The taste to sweetness ratio is absolutely perfect among all the items I've tried here. The respective ingredients shine while the sugar accompanies with subtle grace. Like all other cooking styles, this is an art form and these patissiers are great at their craft.   Unfortunately, I haven't had the pleasure of trying all of their baked goods, but I do have my favorites. The strawberry shortcake cannot be missed. It is the shop's signature dessert. The Tokyo cheesecake is such a delight, and like the shortcake, it is light, fluffy, and pure.   I once purchased a whole Tokyo cheesecake for two and never looked back. It's worth it. Trust me.   The rest of patisserie's selection include chocolate cake, mont blanc, panna cotta, tiramisu, mille crepe, cream puffs, a wide range of macarons, and so much more. You'll never run out of things to sample here in one of the best bakeries in town.",

It is small inside hence not much seating for larger groups.  You can definitely take their treats to go.  Service was ok as it was busy.  Although it did take them a while just to bring out desserts from their case.  That was a little puzzling.  If the flavor matched the beautifully decorated desserts, I'd be writing a completely different review.  Unfortunately I felt a little bit of a let down when it came to biting into the few choices I sampled.  I tried the Coconut Chiffon Cake as well as the Mont Blanc.  Both equally just ok in my book.  I don't know... maybe I just picked the two bland desserts in the case.   I wouldn't be opposed to coming back again to try a crepe or different dessert.  Everyone deserves a second chance.",

Absolutely delicious. The Mont Blanc threw me off because of the chestnut flavor. It also gave me some flashbacks to French class when we only ever talked about French desserts hahaha. Nonetheless, it was a light but enjoyable little cake. But the one dessert that steals my heart is the green tea crepe cake. The dessert is delicate and not as sweet as you would expect. It's also the one that I find to disappear first :-((  I do buy a box full of desserts for my family from time to time, and they just love everything I bring back. The cream puffs are usually a total hit.",

I hate the Suzuya is right around the corner from me because I usually order too much stuff for two people (me and my husband). I have to space my visits apart to ensure I don't have to regularly buy new (bigger) pants.   Though I've visited twice on the way home from work, it's best to arrive at or close to opening to ensure the widest selection possible. Whatever time you come, rest assured that the pastry will be flaky, the custard creamy and flavorful, the presentation cute AF, and the service friendly and attentive.   My personal favorites are the yuzu pana cotta, strawberry mille crepe, cream puffs and millefeuille. The latter is flaky pie dough layered with vanilla custard cream. The pastry is buttery and perfectly crisp.  All of the cream puffs are well done, but I especially enjoy the strawberry and chocolate flavors. The filling on the chocolate cream puff is reminiscent of a quality chocolate ice cream, but stuffed into pastry. What's not to love? You also can't go wrong with the matcha selections. Duh.   One should keep in mind:  - This is an Asian-influenced bakery. Don't expect something over-creamy, over-saccharine, or over-anything. What makes the treats here so great is that they're balanced or, as all my aunts would put it, \"they're sweet, but not too sweet.\"  - Parking is shared with Jiffy Lube. Watch out for those maniacs speeding through looking for an oil change   - The cafe area is small, but super cute.  - There's a loyalty program now, which means my gluttony will now be rewarded. So long, current pants...   I have yet to try to coffee or crepes, but I can't imagine they'd be any less enjoyable than everything else.",

Bakery has a very limited selection of pastries and treats.  What we tried was very good but very expensive.  Many of the treats we consider standard fare at a Japanese bakery are not available here.  With the high price and limited selection, its just okay.  Will try back in a few months time to see if they have expanded their selection and lowered pricing.",

Yes, it's THAT good :) Typical Japanese level of sweetness, doesn't get you disgusted after finishing 3 desserts (yeah I actually finished 3 of those, with some help lol ). The savory crepe is also to die for, we ordered the B.A.T and it has plenty greens, delicious and healthy. The three desserts we ordered were the strawberry millecrepe cake, green tea cake and apricot custard crepe. Both strawberry and green tea cakes were perfect, I personally like their millecrepe better than lady M's , a little bit less creamy and less sweet. The apricot has the little bit of sourness that my tongue's not used to. Next time I would like to try their ham cheese savory crepe , cheese cake, cream puff, millefeuille, pudding ... Oh I'm just gonna keep coming back to try everything. Forgot to mention, their coffee!",

Holy moly I am ruined for life. Their crepes have the PERFECT texture and taste awesome. But when you fill them with fresh strawberry jam or make it a cannoli crepe with ricotta filling and pistachios mmm. They are taken to a whole nother level. Our family favorite is Nutella and bananas, super creative huh ;)  I highly recommend Suzuya for anyone who's looking for a dessert that is packed with flavor but not heavy!",

The coffee taste was not overwhelming like other ones I've tasted. It was well balanced My friend ordered the strawberry crepe cake which was quite refreshing. It was definitely the best tiramisu I've had in a while.  The way the desserts were presented was very neat and clean. The bakery is well maintained and clean as well. I wish they were open longer though.",

    "text": "Oh my goodness! Suzuya has many items to offer! I reccommend coming early when they open when they have more selection because close to closing time a lot of their items are sold out. Some of my friends bought me sweets here for a birthday treat. I loved all of the delicious cakes they gave me! I came here recently with my niece and it was the first time coming to the actual shop. It is a really cute little cafe-like enviornment. They have a section to get water, which are served in glasses rather than plastic cups like most other places. When eating in, I got the rare blueberry cheesecake and a passion fruit macaroon. The cheesecake was so fluffy and the berries were not sour at all like most blueberries I encounter. The macaroon was just so amazing. I was sad when I ate it all.  My niece got the green tea macaroon which she said was delicious. She also got some sort of strawberry crepe cake.  They also serve crepes which I have not tried yet but I will next time!",

They were very accommodating on the phone. You have to call at least 3 days in advance so they can make the cake for you. I ordered a 12in' strawberry creme crepe cake, which is a good size to share between 8-10 people. The price wasn't too bad, I believe the cake came out to be a total of $46, but it was a little over $50 with tax. Again, this was a crepe cake, so it's definitely a bit more pricey than a normal cake. I recommend eating it as soon as you can, and not letting it sit for long!",

My most recent visit was after the monthly Chaiya Monastery Food Festival with other yelpers. I had ordered the mont blanc (usual favorite item to get) and by recommendation of Nelson and Sylvia, i got the custard pudding as well.   If you dine in, they'll put your dishes on a japanese style tray, with utensils. Payment is easy through their mounted square system.   Custard Pudding - very smooth and creamy. Not too sweet. Have a sauce on the bottom, similar to one with a flan. great combination. forms a wonderful medley of flavors   Mont Blanc - a dessert that is wonderfully prepared. whipped cream in the center, with piped lines of super aromatic, flavorful chestnut paste-like cream around forming the exterior. topped with a perfectly peeled sweet chestnut.   I've tried a few other desserts as well but not too fresh in my mind. XD But nothing has disappointed me yet. All are prepared wonderfully with an italian taste with a japanese flare. Not too sweet. Even my mom loves it !",

I think cream puff is just average, it isn't special puff, because we've lots of more delicious puff in Japan. Mont Blanc and Kabocha pie and green tea mille crepes and Mille-feuille is my favorite so far. Especially Mille-feuille is amazing!! I've never try their crepes yet, so I'll try it soon.

Maybe better than okay, as they have some very unique flavors, but for what I got I just wasn't wowed.  Coffee menu is small, service is very personable but a bit on the slow side. Opted for the ako cream puff (chef special) and green tea eclair (chef favorite). Both were very light, which I appreciated as I am not much of a sweet tooth. But the dough for both seemed to be the same, overall just seemed very similar despite my effort to try two different items- should have gone for the yuzu pana cotta as I initially wanted, but thought that would be piggish of me.  Super sweet cashier, beautiful desserts and cakes. Will have to return for the yuzu pana cotta and an iced green tea on a hot day. Or a savory crepe for lunch, they sound delish!  Side note for first time visitors: it's in the same plaza as Fish N Bowl, signage just says \"Pastries and Crepes\", NOT Suzuya.",

    "text": "This is my favorite bakery in town!! Especially since the desserts aren't overly sweet, their desserts are something even my parents can enjoy with me. I'm always willing to drive out of my way to get desserts from here. The place itself is a little small, so I usually grab for to-go.  STRAWBERRY SHORTCAKE: IF YOU'RE A FIRST TIMER, TRY THIS!!! The strawberry shortcake is one of suzuya's signature desserts. It's not only super cute, but it's not overbearingly sweet. The whipped cream has a very nice fluffy and velvety texture to it which adds a nice touch. Usually I don't eat all of the whipped cream on cakes but this cake is an exception. The cake portion of it is very airy and soft - perfect. The sponge cake is the star of every cake, it's what makes or breaks it. 3 thumbs up for suzuya!! I've actually gotten the strawberry shortcake done as several of my birthday cakes and all of my guests ALWAYS asked where I got it from.   ICHIGO DAIFUKU: Right now, they have their seasonal ichigo daifuku which is a Japanese mochi stuffed with whipped cream, red bean, and a strawberry. I also think that everybody can agree that Suzuya has THE BEST strawberries in town. I don't get how - but you can't even get strawberries this fresh at the market. I'm convinced it's just the bakery magic. As of right now I haven't been able to find any other place that sells ichigo daifuku, but you should definitely try it at least once! It's kind of $$$ since it's $5 for one, but I'd say to try it at least once!! I've even bought some for my friends to try because it's just that good (rip my wallet is crying).   BLUEBERRY RARE CHEESECAKE: This cheesecake is special because it's actually a non baked cheesecake! I only had a bite of this since it was for my sibling, but it's very light, airy, and melts in your mouth!! You can taste the fresh blueberry for sure. This is more of a traditional cheesecake as opposed to the fluffy Tokyo cheesecake.   TIRAMISU: The cream is very soft, light, and everything a tiramisu should be. Personally, I'm not the biggest fan of tiramisu so I didn't eat much of it, but my sibling recommends it. It has a pretty strong coffee flavor if you're into that!",

Although we've made efforts to cut substantial amounts of sugar out of our diet, we indulge on occasion when the cravings come and we were certainly not disappointed  We ordered the Tokyo Cheesecake(My Favorite), Green Tea Cake and Mont Blanc.   Admittedly, I expected to be a little overwhelmed with all the sugar after having deprived myself of it. Fortunately, I was pleasantly surprised at the subtle but well balanced sweetness that complimented the unique flavors of each dessert.   I was able to pick a favorite simply because I'm a sucker for cheesecake but I highly recommended all three  Can't wait to return for our next 'cheat day'!  PS - there were a number of sold out items when we arrived just before closing. A proper assumption for a place like this can only mean one thing - so get there early for the good stuff!",

Doesn't have much except one beautiful cooler with all sorts of desserts.   But everything we tried tasted really yummy and I used to be an amazing baker.   So I do appreciate their beautiful pastry work",

    "text": "Upon reading amazing reviews, I had very high expectations for Suzuya Patisserie. Unfortunately, I was left with a subpar experience. In fairness, I should probably preface my review by stating that ever since traveling to Japan, nothing is the same.   Upon entering, Suzuya is very pleasing to the eye. It is a simple, modern, and clean bakery that offers a comfortable setting. There are very few places to sit - I noticed majority of the customers took orders to go.   The gentleman at the counter was very nice and willing to answer any questions. However, two minutes after I walked in, it started getting busy and he seemed very flustered. I noticed a job posting on the door so I assumed they were understaffed.   As for the desserts on their own, in my opinion, it was nothing more than just okay. The Tokyo Cheesecake has a decent flavor and sweetness to it - however, the cheesecake on it's own had a ricotta-cheese type texture. Far from the soft traditional cheesecake that I am used to. The green tea cream puff had a delicious green tea filling. It was a perfect sweetness to match the flavor of the green tea. The puff seemed over done.  Overall, I would say it was just an average experience. I wouldn't go out of my way to stop in again.",

Didn't come back until earlier this year. Bought a 6\" Strawberry Shortcake and absolutely loved it! Soft, light, not too sweet and very nicely decorated. Strawberries are also one of my favorite fruits. It was very delicious, and I could probably eat this for dessert every day!     The Chocolate Cake was pretty good because it wasn't heavy and overly sweet like what I am used to. Haven't had much luck with the other cake slices that I tried from here. The Tokyo Cheesecake was the worst - it was dry and very bland. Took a few bites and tossed it in the trash. The Blueberry Rare Cheesecake was creamy, but I didn't like the glaze/sauce that they put on it. Tasted really sour.   Their whole cakes are great for special occasions, gifts and a treat for yourself. Sometimes there is a line outside the store right before they open. The other day, I was 3rd in line and the two customers before me also bought the Strawberry Shortcake. It's their best seller for sure! They can also reserve cakes and take payments over the phone for same day pick up. The ladies that work here are very polite and from the looks of it, they have been really busy this holiday season.   Love it! I'll be back soon for sure!",

When in a rush I got 2 macaroons, 1 tokyo cheesecake slice and a barley tea.   Love the barley tea it is light and has a unique flavor. I love it.   The tokyo cheesecake is a lite and fluffy cheesecake. Honestly it taste like 70% of a NY cheesecake.  About 70% as sweet and dense. The price is also reasonable.   The macroons are nice just at $2.50 each they are a tad pricey.   Service could be improved.",

Suzuya is a sophisticated Japanese Pastry shop where you can order from a display of fresh made cakes, macaroons, and pastries.   I ordered the blueberry cheesecake, mini pumpkin pie, Tokyo Cheesecake, and the Earl Grey Macaron. The thing I love about all their desserts is that none of them are overly sweet (like most Asian styled desserts) and the sweetness that is there comes from natural ingredients never artificial.   The blueberry cheesecake was light, smooth and tart. Their mini pumpkin pie was delicious with real pumpkin puree. The Tokyo cheesecake was fluffy and airy. The macaron was a generous size and individually wrapped. I loved the vast variety of macaron flavors which included flavors like red bean and passion fruit, among others.   I was also able to try their Cold Brew Coffee, and it was rich, complex and delicious. Even a coffee connoisseur spoke very highly of their coffee too. There is some seating indoors and outdoors, ample parking outside, and super friendly and quick service. 5 stars all the way!",

They are delicate, soft, delicious and never overly sweet...just sweet enough for you to day-dream about later on.   I've ordered full cakes from here on many occasions, including birthday cakes and just-because cakes. There are a variety of small, personal sized, pastry and dessert treats as well so you don't have to commit to one big cake...but I'm sure you won't regret it if you go big. You need to give a couple of days advance notice for your cake to ensure you will get exactly what you want... Though they seem to make a few each day so can always push your luck and see if something is available when you come.   There are a handful of exceptional Japanese dessert restaurants in town, such as Sweets Raku, and for sure Suzuya Patisserie is one of my top 3. Love what they're doing here!  -2018 review #21-",

I called in to order an 8'' strawberry shortcake for my boyfriend's bday. The person I spoke to was really nice and made the process easy. I had to drive across town to pick up the cake during my lunch break and it was quick even though there were quite a few people coming in to order. The ladies behind the counter were pleasant to everyone despite being busy. The cake was delicious and my whole family loved it. It was light, fluffy, and not overly sweet. The coffee is also good!

The bakery was nice and orderly and we were welcomed as we entered. There isn't much seating but it was fine because it wasn't overly crowded. The desserts aren't abundantly sweet yet still desirable. The flavors seemed to come out more in that sense.   We ordered a Tokyo cheesecake and Mont Blanc to chow down on inside and some pumpkin cream puffs and Macarons to go. The cheesecake was heaven, so light and tall. I wish I could have had the whole thing to myself. The Mont Blanc was interesting. It had a lot of different flavors and textures going on. The almond tart on the bottom was superb, so delicious! I really liked the sponge cake as well. The cream puff didn't lack in tasting like pumpkin spice but more sweetness would have been nice.   Now the macarons! Incredible! My favorite macarons in town for sure. Bursting with flavor and the texture was spot on. I could have just ordered a tray of those and been content. The passion fruit was my favorite followed closely by the chocolate raspberry, although all the ones we got were so good! They're unlike any macaron I've had. They were each neatly wrapped. I must go back for more.   SUZUYA was worth the drive across town.",

My favorite is the mont blanc. The chestnut flavor really shines through, and the chestnut on top is oddly nostalgic. I have yet to try the crepes or the drinks, but I hope to next time I stop by. The matcha crepe cake is also light with deep flavor.   My only complaint is the short hours, but it's understandable that they close early because these desserts go quick. The prices are reasonable; you definitely get your money's worth.",

It wasn't too sweet but tasted good. I took home the blueberry rare cheesecake and strawberry shortcake. I had a tasting of the blueberry cheesecake today and it wasn't heavy like normal cheesecakes because it wasn't baked but it tasted delicious. My son had the strawberry shortcake and I had a bite of it and it was lite and airy but still delicious also. They do have drinks also that they serve. The service there was great. The place is small with just a few tables to sit on. I would definitely recommend this place to anyone for after lunch/dinner dessert for their variety of desserts. They also have a large selection of macaroons. I will definitely go here again and take my family and friends here.",

The portion size is small, but I will come back and try one of their pastries so other time.  Today, I was just there with one thing in mind, a crepe.  I ordered the banana and chocolate crepe with green tea ice cream inside.  Although I am not an expert in crepes, I felt that this crepe was made a little too thick and was not crispy at all.  I just remembered how wonderful Marion Crepes was when I was in Tokyo's Harajuku (Takeshita dori) and I am a little disappointed with this one.  The first crepe they tried to make on the griddle didn't turn out, so they had to start all over.  There is quite the technique to make the perfect crepe, and obviously the first crepe did not pass their quality control.  It looked okay to me.  I felt like saying to her, it's okay, I will eat it anyway.  But like I said before, they are perfectionist at their craft.  The finish product looked great.  The crepe batter was quite tasty, and the combination of flavours wasn't bad.  I just wished that the crepe was a little more crispy and thin.  I will return, and try one of their delightful looking pastries even though it looks to picture perfect to eat.",

The crepe was soft but held together and the slightly crispy edge on the first bite was fantastic. We all loved it but my son took 1 bite and decided it was too good to share the rest. We have had crepes at other places but these were the best we have had. Coffee is fresh brewed to order with plenty of choices to accompany it like Coconut or almond milk creamer and agave, raw sugar, stevia in the raw or simple syrup. I had the egg custard with simple fruit on top. It tasted like a lighter super creamy flan.. DELICIOUS!! Try it..It's hard to find anything to complain about. The owners and staff were very friendly and accommodating even with our children. The whole store and even the restroom was super clean. We will definitely go back to try the other flavors.",

    "text": "Like a few reviewers before, I'm somewhat conflicted on how I feel about this place. It's a great addition to those who live in the SW side of town, and they do have tasty pastries. I guess I'm biased because I had really high expectations on coming here from all the reviews, and it's been in my bookmarks for some time now. It's clean, and good compared to other asian pastry shops here in town, but if you ever travel outside of Vegas, you'll see that there are places that can execute the balance of flavors a little better. If I could give it 3.5, I would. We tried the coffee jelly, tiramisu, and green tea cream puff. They're all fine, but I didn't finish any of them, which is unusual for me. Even though I'm only giving it 3 stars for now, I do encourage you to give it a try to taste something different here in Vegas!",

They have a mille crepe which is so simple but so damn yummy.  It's pink fluffy strawberry creme layered with their crepe.  I have to say you must try it.  I also had the banana, chocolate and whip creme crepe with shaved almonds.  They were all very simple flavors but together wrapped in their signature crepe, it was delectable.",

I do look forward to see more options to be added along with the crepe variety. This place also makes cakes for those special occasions. Will try the cake selections next time an occasion comes up.",

    "text": "This bakery might have the best macarons I have eaten. It's not overly sweet like most bakeries. There were some unique flavors, for example, anko, shoyu, and matcha. There were other flavors, but I only ate the matcha, shoyu, anko, earl grey, and hazelnut latte. They were delicious! I could really taste the green tea, and the color of the cookie didn't look fake. It's a beautiful emerald green like matcha supposed to look. I think they infused the matcha into it instead of using food dye, which I appreciate! Best matcha macaron I have eaten. I was hesitant to buy the shoyu, but I am glad I did! It was so delicious! The salt particles pair very well with the sweetness and the caramel. The hazelnut latte smelled so good! The coffee taste was strong, I'm not a straight coffee person, but I do like a good latte. I think out of the five, my favorites were the matcha, shoyu, and hazelnut latte.   Also, I bought a slice of the green tea milliecrepe cake, strawberry shortcake, and one of the animal cream puff. My husband bought the chocolate cake and cream pudding.  The match milliecrepe cake was okay, but it had a little more bean paste than I would like. The strawberry shortcake was delicious! Light and fluffy, the whipped cream was not too sweet, the strawberries were fresh. I can eat a whole cake! The animal cream puff was delicious, but not very memorable. It was adorable, though. It reminded me of Chopper from One Piece. Next time, I would like to try the other cream pudd flavors.  Lastly, my husband said the chocolate cake tasted okay, but not memorable. The cream pudding, though... it was very delicious! He really enjoyed it. Also, our grandmother thought it was delicious too!",

Everything was excellent as usual. The only thing that was not as good as before was strawberry shortcake. It is bigger than before which is a good thing.

The crepe texture is close, but the filling and cream was okay for me. My heart still goes out to my first love in Cali.   Mont blan cream was good, but I didn't like their sponge cake as usual.   Tiramisu had good cream, but it could use more ladyfingers. But this is how it's done in Japan with very little ladyfinger and more cream so it is what it is.  I'd have to say out of all the places you can purchase cake, this place is the closest to how it tastes in Japan. Generally lighter (airy) than European and American bakeries.",

It's small bakery sort of hidden next to Sonic, owned by husband and wife. Workers are friendly, and there's some seating area available. Along with desserts they also serve crepes, coffee and tea. The crepes are good but I'm a bigger fan of the baked goods.   My number 1 recommendation (if you're a green tea lover like me) is the green tea eclair. They put A LOT of filling and it's not too sweet. Ugh freaking amazing. Sometimes they don't have the eclair so I'll go with the green tea cream puff which is basically a smaller version of it.   Also, my other favorite is the green tea macaron. Hands down the best green tea macaron I've tried all the macaron places I've tried. It's so nice and soft in the inside and again the filling has a nice matcha flavor and is not too sweet.  Green tea cake, again, best green tea cake I've ever had. The apple pie is another delicious treat. The crepes on the other hand could use a little work. I've tried some of the savory crepes and for me some of the flavors just don't pair with each other. Like for the spinach avocado bacon, I felt like the spinach really overpowered a lot. But that's all good cuz I washed that flavor out with some green tea cream puffs ;)",

The cheesecake is different than the New York cheesecake style you can get from an American pastry store, it has some Asian taste to it, but it's really good.   The tiramisu cake is amazing. We loved it. Very spongy but still has enough coffee taste in it. I actually even ate it more than my boyfriend. All of their cakes are not super sweet, better for health than super sweet cakes.   The Mont Blanc is good as well but I would give them this order: tiramisu, cheesecake and Mont Blanc. I don't think you can go wrong with any of these cakes. I would want to come here and get these cute cakes everyday but I don't want to be broke either.   The people there are very nice. They gave me complimentary candles as I said it was my BFs birthday, although they are just itty bitty candles.",

The cakes are light and too airy. The custards, of which there are many, have too many stabilizers and too little genuine flavor.  I've been here twice, so I tried, and it might be a western palate thing, I just didn't like it. I'm well versed in Chinese bakeries but these are not that...",

Around this time of the year, Suzuya's seasonal Kabocha items are what I like to look for.Originally a pie, Chef Misuzu has transformed the pie into a turnover which is equally good.(Ask to get it warmed up!) A few of her other desserts have had a makeover as well, but the taste and quality has always remained top notch.  Another new addition to Suzuya's delicious pastries and crepes is their tea selections. I tried a Milk Oolong Tea which was served in these SWEET Magisso tilting tea cups(from Finland) that have a built-in tea strainer.You infuse the water and tea for a few minutes, then tilt back and enjoy! The tea was smooth, delicious, and fragrant. They have a few other varieties sourced from small independent businesses in Asia, so be sure to inquire when partaking in their tea service.  I definitely plan on enjoying another good cup of tea with Suzuya's pastries and crepes very soon!  ALOHA!!!  Shaka Meter:  \\uuu/  \\uuu/  \\uuu/  \\uuu/  \\uuu/  5",

I wonder why it took so long time to unpeal two pieces of cakes and placing them on a plate with two forks.  There was nothing much special about the cakes. The cakes were tiny. The only thing that came to my mind was that they are not that sweet. Almost not sweet. I do not like cakes being too sweet, so that was good. Overall, I would not come this far again to eat these cakes.",

Some of their more special cakes, such as the coconut, can sell out so getting there early is ideal.   All their desserts look very delicate and to an extent they are, the cakes are airy, crusts are flaky. But they all have rich, decadent accents such as frostings, fillings etc. The best thing however, is the sweetness of the desserts. None of their goods are too sweet, if that makes any sense for desserts. It is sweet enough to let you know it is a dessert, but not so sweet as to mask the more subtle flavors such as green tea or almonds, etc.  The location is a little far from me, located in the southwest corner of the valley, far from most, but definitely worth the drive an visit!",

Strawberry cream puff -I didn't wanna get it initially cuz after all it's just a cream puff, right? Well, I am so glad I let the kids ordered this. the cream is so good!

After waiting about 5-6 minutes in line, we were told by the worker behind the counter \"just so you know, we're closing early today\". We said, \"oh okay we don't plan on staying long\". He replied \"like 5 though\". Knowing it was 5:05 already, we clearly weren't wanted there and simply left. The thought a small business turns away customers is interesting.

    "text": "Items Selected:  Kabocha Squash Cream Puff Anko Bean Cream Puff Fuji Apple Pie Mille Feuille Rocky Road Crepe - Slivered Almonds, Pocky, Chocolate, Kinako Marshmallow, Whipped Cream  A relative newcomer to the diverse Las Vegas pastry scene I'd originally been made aware of Suzuya by a friend suggesting the small southwestern store produced the best crepes in town; not particularly a dish I go out of my way for...at least until he also mentioned the phrase mille-feuille and caused me to dig deeper, my research quickly mandating a Saturday visit when already in the area for lunch with a colleague from at Born and Raised.  Small and neat, a simple pastry case and a crepe stone at the front of the restaurant with the kitchen in back and a few stools and chairs for dining in it was just after 10:15 when I arrived at Suzuya and with a couple picking up a custom cake while another woman, clearly a regular, stopped in for two-dozen apple pies I spent some time chatting with the employees about what was best, eventually allowing them to talk me into a crepe to go with a quartet from the case.  Clearly focused on fusion but well-versed in French techniques my tasting of Suzuya started with a pair of crisp and buttery choux puffs filled with traditional Japanese accoutrements and although I'd have personally preferred the squash to be more sweetened the red bean version was exquisite and the pasty textbook, a trend that would continue onward to the buttery lattice of the subtly sweet apple pie and a crisp mille feuille filled to order and garnished with Chantilly cream and fresh fruit - both every bit on par with versions from b.patisserie during my June visit to the Bay and as such amongst the best I've experienced stateside.  Clearly not leaving without at least doing due diligence to the crepe it can only be said that as far as crepes go this was about as good as it gets, the batter light and airy with a silken mouthfeel just robust enough to hold up to the equally light ingredients and a veritable deal at $4.75 which will see me back sooner rather than later to enjoy the mille-crepe cake or whatever Chef Misuzu and Plourde think of next.",

This is a definite must for anyone who lives in the SW.  Typically I like my crepes slightly crisp but everything about the Banana/Chocolate/Whip Cream crepe i ordered was perfect.  It was served cold and the crepe was so light and delicate.   The crepe had a slight pleasant chew, almost mochi-like.  Sometimes crepes are overly sweet but I could eat several of these in one sitting.  In addition to the crepe, we also got the Coconut Chiffon Cake and the Apple Pie.  All of the desserts are really light, not overly sweet and highly addicting.  We ordered a slice and inhaled it in 3-4 bites.   Now I see why people order whole cakes in advance.  The apple pie had great crust and had enormous chunks of apple.....before i cut into it, i was thinking let their be big chunks of perfectly cooked al dente apples and Suzuya delivered.  I live 5 mins from Suzuya and have now just discovered it .  I'm going to have to make up for much lost time.   Do yourself a favor and check it out asap!",

Most of the time people just come in and pick up. You will find different types of pastries here such as matcha cake, Tokyo cheesecake, mango passion fruit cake, cream puffs, etc. It has a lot of Japanese based flavors, but from my experience it is amazing. I like how everything is always fresh and it isn't too sweet. I'm not a fan of pastries or desserts overwhelming my taste buds with sweetness. It has a good balance of sweetness and comforting taste. I've only been here twice and I got the matcha cake both times. It is a little on the pricey side as you're paying close to 5 bucks for a slice, but you won't be upset with the quality. The lady is nice and very welcoming. I will come here if I wanna get a good cake for a special occasion or if I am craving some pastries.",

After about 15 minutes of waiting in line to order, I made it to the counter and placed my order for slices of cake to bring home to my family to sample. I got the green tea cake, coconut chiffon cake, chocolate cake, strawberry shortcake, and the layered crepe cake with strawberry mousse filling. They packaged my goods for me to go, and I excitedly made my way back home.   My palate is definitely biased toward Asian flavors, but I guess not when it comes to dessert. These Japanese style cakes had a great, light and spongy texture to the cakes themselves but the fillings and frosting lacked a lot of flavor. To me, everything but the chocolate cake tasted the same and was bland and failed to satisfy my sweet tooth. To be fair though, the chocolate cake was pretty amazing! I may come back to try their crepes but definitely not the cakes unless it's chocolate.",

My family came in 10 minutes before they closed and every seat was filled (albeit there are only a few seats available, but I would have expected them to be completely dead by that time.) One of the associates offered us a sample of the green tea eclair and unfortunately, I wasn't wowed by it and it also left a less than pleasurable taste in my mouth. I was wanting to try their green tea cake originally, but after that, I was a little scared.   We tried:  Coconut Chiffon Cake: Hands down my favorite. It wasn't too sweet and the cream inside, along with the actual cake itself literally melted in my mouth. I would keep coming back for this alone.  Strawberry Shortcake: Again, not too sweet-so I immediately liked it, BUT it was a little dry :( I definitely think that us coming in SO close to their closing time was a huge factor in that though. Next time, we will go earlier in the day.   Apple Pie: They heated it up for us (even though they were closing in 4 minutes) and it was delicious. My bf wasn't too impressed by it, but I thought it had a great balance of sweet, tart, & crunchy. Probably would have been better with vanilla ice cream though ;)  The service is definitely hospitable and they even asked us if we wanted it \"for here or to-go\" and they didn't give us bewildered looks when we said \"for here\". Shows that they really appreciated our business even though they were literally closed by the time they brought out our order. We will definitely come back to try other pastries they offer, especially their savory crepes! Can't wait!",

The eclair didn't taste fresh, and neither did the cream puffs. The cream puffs were really soggy at the bottom. Also, the cashier's bare fingers touched the eclair she wanted to serve us as she was reaching towards the front of the case. Not very appetizing.",

    "text": "Whoah.  Despite living in the area since well before they opened, I only finally tried Suzuya yesterday. And now I know what the fuss is all about.  You can really taste the subtlety of the green tea flavor in their Green Tea Cake. It was a tad difficult to eat with that dainty, fancy fork. But that's a trivial complaint.  Their Rocky Road Crepe is incredible. The toasted almonds, marshmallows, chocolate sauce, and whipped cream combine for a decadent treat that doesn't feel overly heavy. Add a dollop of vanilla ice cream and it doesn't get much better.  Don't miss this small store like I had for the longest time. They sure know what they're doing. Elegant and delicious desserts served with care and attention to detail.",

    "text": "First thoughts: adorable and quaint. The space and offerings remind me a pastry shops I enjoy in Hawaii. My friend told me I had to try their Milli Crepe Cake, but due to its popularity, we didn't even get to catch a glimpse of this beautiful concoction. We were advised to call at least a day prior to reserve a slice ($4.50) or cake ($45?).  Everything is so pretty! It was really hard to decide on a pastry, so I went with three, hehe. I tried the special of the day, Millefeuille (also known as a Napoleon; layers of puff pastry alternating with layers of pastry cream, topped with fresh fruits), Yuzu Panna Cotta, and Fuji Apple Pie. Everything was so light and delicious!! Nothing is overly sweet, which makes your dessert time guilt-free. The layers of the Millefeuille were difficult to cut with the dainty knife (although extremely adorable!), but it was airy when you bit into it paired with the wonderful cream. The panna cotta was creamy and firm and the yuzu cut through the dessert with freshness and a citrus kick. My friend got a slice of the Coconut Chiffon Cake and that was light and delicious as well!   They brought our pastries on adorable trays with equally adorable utensils. Seriously, coolest pastry utensils ever. Where do I get these gorgeous forks, spoons, and knives? There was also a carafe of iced water available at the register. Seriously, I don't think you could go wrong with any of the pastries or cakes and I can't wait to try their crepes!",

    "text": "I love this place. The crepes for one are delicious. They also have lots of different types of goodies and every time you go there's something new. So far, I've tried every \"regular\" macaron, and some of their speciality ones. They recently had a rose one and a sake flavored one! I didn't try it but sounded interesting.  They also have cakes, tiramisu... but it's hard to name everything because it gets changed up. I think that's part of the novelty.   The only reason I knocked it down a star is because while some may see it as special care in preparing and packaging the goodies, the service is always a bit frustrating. There's one person doing several jobs and it holds up the line and you need to devote a bit of time before getting your treats. A small price to pay, but can be a bit cumbersome.",

The matcha crepe cake, the macaron was one the best I've had and the Japanese cheesecake all lived up to the hype.  Hate the location tho...it's in a random tiny shopping center hidden behind a gas station and the hours suck.  They close too early and I wish they had more seating",

The workers greeted me with a welcoming smile as I walked through the doors. The bakery is tiny and quaint. I believe there was seating for 2 parties or so. Suzuya had a handful of sweet selections despite their tiny glass display. At the very bottom of the display there were about 5 or so cake selections. I ended up choosing the beautiful mango crepe cake and OMG! It was by far my second most favorite cake I've ever tasted.  It was the perfect amount of sweet. It was definitely noticeable that the cake was made fresh that same day. I was so happy with this choice and I'm excited to try what else this place has to offer.",

    "text": "PERFECT AMOUNT OF SWEETNESS . **2017 Yelp 100 Challenge LV #4** . This place is hidden so I would have to definitely say this is a hidden TREASURE BOX for sure. They are located BEHIND a body shop so you would never be able to find it just by driving on Durango dr. The inside decor is simply cute & small. All their desserts are displayed in the fridge for you to pick & choose. Along w/ their pastries, they have yummy soft crepes as well!  . The  staff members are ALWAYS super sweet & attentive & happy, but honestly I would be freaken happy everyday too if I worked in that pastry shop!  .  The pastries for MOST of them have just the PERFECT textures & not overwhelming SWEETNESS. I believe it is these factors that make you simply CRAVE this place consistently.   CANNOLLI CREPE $4.75 - I am obsessed w/ this crepe cuz it has a little crunch from the pistassio & I like to add nutella for a little more flavor  GREEN TEA CAKE $4.25 - This was simple w/ a little crunch. The cake part wasn't dry.  MONT BLANC $4.75 - I seriously love this mont blanc... it's not like my favorite from raku sweet, but it's comparable when I need a quicky craving fix  TIRAMISU $4.75 - This is my style of tiramisu... lots of cream & a strong espresso KICK  BLACKBERRY CHEESECAKE $4.5 - velvety smooth & very light on the blackberry flavor  TOKYO CHEESCAKE $3.75 - This was a bit disappointing since it was super DRY =[ YUZU PANNA COTTA $3.75 - I don't think I like yuzu as a dessert    COCONUT CHIFFON CAKE $3.6 - I could eat a WHOLE CAKE to myself no problem! Super fluffy & the cream makes it nice & moist  CHOCOLATE CAKE $3.95 - just a simple cake that is NOT overwhelmingly sweet   STRAWBERRY SHORTCAKE $3.95 - This cake is light & refreshing because of the fresh strawberries",

This place has a variety of sweet and savory crepes that they make to order and a display of macarons, mille crepes, cream puffs, and other pastries to choose from. My boyfriend and I ordered the mango mille crepe, which is their seasonal mille crepe, and the strawberry cream mille crepe to go. Both were good but if I had to choose one over the other, I would say that liked the mango mille crepe better. The mango slices in the mille crepe gave a much better balance of sweetness from the cream and fruit. We didn't get a chance to try the other pastries but it'll give us a good reason to come back again. I definitely recommend this place!",

    "text": "My friend told me about this place months ago, and I never tried it until now. Man have I missed out!!  This place is sooo elegant, classy, inexpensive, and just such a great experience if you're trying to do something different.  Ambience/Customer Service: As I came, my brother and I were greeted by a \"good afternoon!\" And I just started looking around , then the cashier asked if I've been there before and answered all the questions I had and it was fun looking. Honestly I was just such a little kid about everything because the display was really pretty and I wanted to try sooo many things but you know, my wallet was on a diet. The table settings were fancy, with marble table tops and high chairs. It was very clean and I liked that (I mean duh who doesn't!) but this place was impeccably clean. And whoever did the interior design, good job! I felt good and welcome.   Prices: I mentioned earlier that my wallet was ok a diet, and I was not going to spend more than 15 dollars. And yayyy I got 2 cakes and a decent size tea within my budget. The cakes are around 3-4 dollars and it was just more than reasonable. I could go to the strip and get similar cakes for double the price. So this made me and my wallet happy :)   Food: So on the day I went I tried the strawberry shortcake and the Tokyo cheesecake. Let me just tell you; the strawberry shortcake is a taste of happiness and strawberry goodness. It was sweet but not overly sweet, and felt like biting into a fluffy cloud. YUM! The Tokyo cheesecake, was not my cup of tea, but it was still yummy in my tummy! It too was sweet but not as sweet. I really like how the cut of the cakes were perfect too. I ordered nitro hibiscus tea and it was good because it canceled out the sweetness in the cakes but not too much and so I never got too tired of the cakes. The hibiscus tea was pretty fruity in taste and tarty, but I know a lot of people who like tea of this flavor. This too was not my favorite but a perfect mix of what I had ordered. I can tell the pastries and cakes were made with quality and it makes all the food taste much more better!   Overall: Overall I really like this place and hope they grow to be bigger. Keep up wit the great customer experience and with them perfect cake slices.",

I ordered the Rocky Road Crepe, which was filled with marshmallow and drizzled with chocolate syrup after being sprinkles with thinly sliced almonds. Can you stop drooling? Neither could I!  The service was impeccable. The uniforms are appealing, and they wear aprons, which I like. The store was clean and the presentation of my dessert was astonishing. Simplistic yet adventurous.  Pros: clean, great customer service, simple menu, inexpensive, variety of desserts, private parking, good location, outdoor seating area  Cons: Didn't hear any music, no wifi  Overall: Great dessert shop, with attitude! I'll be coming back!",

    "text": "This was quite the posh patisserie, with a Japanese flair. The interior was small and pretty busy, a group or two of 3-4 enjoying their time over a cup of coffee and a slice of cake. The rest were in line waiting for their customized cake and pastries that were in the glass case. I decided to choose a green tea cream puff and an earl grey macaron; while I don't remember the exact prices of each, I do remember that the total came out to be over $5 for the two small items, so yes, this place is on the pricier side because of the high quality of the ingredients. I loved that these little desserts weren't too sweet, however I did find the macaron to be a bit too chewy for my taste. Overall though, I had a positive experience here and I would love to come back on a day that was less crowded with a friend or two.",

The large cream puffs have a good amount of whipped cream and custard inside. I haven't tried their other desserts or coffees yet but they do have a seasonal Fiji apple tart I think. And I saw some cold brew on tap which I've been meaning to try... maybe next time. The only downside is that they close pretty early and will usually sell out of cream puffs so call ahead",

My group of 10 ordered a handful of different cakes/desserts and shared - we love making dessert sample platters :)   The major consensus listed by best to least favorite based on flavor &  sweetness.   -Blueberry cheesecake: The group's favorite; not too sweet and just the right amount of density/creaminess with a subtle hint of blueberry (a lot of American cheesecakes are quite dense with cheese and too strong in flavor).   -Tiramisu: great espresso/coffee flavor. The bottom layer of cake was doused with espresso/coffee. The whipped cream was soft and airy.   -Cream puff: MY favorite bc I love custards and this one had specs of vanilla bean sprinkled through the batter.   - Strawberry Shortcake: not too sweet, airy soft sponge cake with huge chunks of strawberries.   - Green tea crepe cake: had little bits of red beans scattered throughout. I kept thinking about Lady M back home and how it didn't match up to Lady M's crepe cakes. Green tea was too subtle and quite bland.   - Mont Blanc - chestnutty flavor. The lady behind us got mad we got the last one but I didn't see what her deal was after eating it - it was ok, nothing spectacular in flavor.   -Lemon Panna Cotta - too tart.   -Tokyo Cheesecake: group's least favorite. It was a dense block of blandness/wanna-be cheesecake.",

It had about 20 layers of crepes in between a light cream. I could have eaten like 3 of these! We also ordered the Blueberry Cheesecake which was also very light. It's not like Cheesecake Factory Cheese cake it was light like the consistency of Flan. This is not a bad thing because it was delicious and it made me feel like I wasn't over doing it on dessert. Plus I was sharing so technically it was like I was having one dessert. I was going to get more but my husband apparently thought I was overdoing it lol. I'm glad I ordered when I did because this guy ordered a few minutes after me ordered like 6 pastries. It was close to closing and their desserts were sparse. It's better to get to Suzuya earlier so you can have a bigger selection.   The seating is small inside but they have a few tables outside as well. It's a nice little cafe to meet up with friends and the treats are not expensive . They could run from $2.50 and up which is great for the quality!",

    "text": "\"Softer than a lullaby, deeper than the midnight sky, soulful as a baby's cry, my Sweet Kabocha Pie\" - James Taylor   I'm a sucker for yuzu & cream. Suzuya's Yuzu Panna Cotta is an excellent form of this pairing and one of my go-to items at Suzuya.   I don't know what it is about this charming space specifically, but I almost enjoy stepping into the quaint pastry shop that is Suzuya as much as I enjoy eating their delicious offerings...ALMOST, that is.  Suzuya has its staple items that you will regularly find, but just as significant are the seasonal specialties--typically made with whatever fruits are in season at the time. Sometimes it is easier to remember the lovely seasonal items when they are no longer available...like their Mango Milli Crepe Cake, or Kabocha Pie/Tart, the final of which I enjoy enough to alter the otherwise beautiful lyrics of James Taylor in my opening quote...but it is that good...so good that Taylor would change the lyrics himself if he had the chance to try it.   I realize that this review is quite late to the Suzuya party...I've been coming for years with a daft for almost as long...long enough to think I already published the review, but if you're new to Suzuya or looking for a place to start they have several popular items including their Custard, Green Tea Cake, Cheesecakes (blueberry is wonderful when available), Strawberry Shortcake, Creme Puffs...oh, and crepes...strawberries and cream and rocky road are popular options for their crepes, but as with the pastry case, it's hard to choose poorly if it's something you think you'll like as so much of Suzuya's pastries and crepes are incredible. I'm not much of a cake fan, but when my love asked me where I wanted a birthday cake from, I knew I wanted it to come from Suzuya",

When you walk in, you're met with the case of glorious cakes and pastries. What caught my eye first was the Mont Blanc. An almond tarte with chantilly cream, a hint of rum. It's topped with a whole chestnut that is candied somehow. The texture was soft and easy to bite through and the color is muted yellow. The prettiest and most delicious selection for me was the Millefeuille. I was enraptured by the flakey pie crust with vanilla custard cream layers. I may not be able to pronounce it, but I had no problem eating it.  The woman behind the counter was very friendly and eager to help. I love an enthusiastic guest service experience. It makes me feel like they want to be involved and truly want to be part of the experience so I'll come back. It's like your grandmother is helping you, only she was way younger and had more to offer than vanilla wafers.  I hope to find myself on this side of town again soon... but I may have to find an excuse to just make my way for no reason. No reason except, Millefeuille.",

My Japanese mother was in town and had seen their pictures on Yelp and insisted that we check it out. I honestly didn't know this place existed even though we live right around the corner. What a hidden gem!  My mom's eyes lit up when we walked in the cafe and just went gaga for their little pastry treats. My mom enjoyed a quick Japanese convo with the Japanese pastry chef and ordered pretty much every item on display, some which she was getting packed up to take back with her to Texas.   Everything and I mean everything we tried was just wonderful. The cream filling was fluffy and not overly sweet. The cake was moist and flavorful. The fruits were fresh and perfectly ripe. You can tell that they take pride in their pastries and treat it like art. Every piece of pastry is a masterpiece. I haven't had such amazing pastries since my last visit to Japan in 2014. So glad this place is here. Might not be frequenting the place too much before my upcoming wedding, got to watch my waistline, but I'll definitely be coming by after the wedding. I think I'll deserve a nice treat after that.",

They plate your pastries for you to enjoy there and bring it to your table, which I thought was nice.  Everything was delicious. Our personal favorites were the Tokyo cheesecake and the Mont blanc. The cheesecake was light and fluffy and had that perfect balance of sweetness. To be honest, I'm not sure what exactly the Mont blanc was, I just know it was amazing and I wish I had ordered another! What I really loved about all of their desserts was that nothing was super sugary or fatty. We finished almost everything and left without feeling bloated.  My only wish was that they had more seating! There's really only 3 places to sit, so coming in a group can be a bit challenging. Also, unfortunately, they no longer serve their crepes. I've heard so much about them that it was really a bummer!",

    "text": "Best bakery in town, all assortment of desserts and pastries taste amazing like something you will get in Japan. Delicate and not overly sweet (which might not be for some).  Have bought cakes here usually for a small group of people and it doesn't break the bank. We've ordered the Strawberry, Fruit and Coconut Chiffon cakes, all of which looked & tasted great. Never complete without a personalized cookie placard!  Other items I've tried: (from most to least fav) -Mont blanc (not for those with a nut allergy, sweetest dessert I've tried there) -Custard pudding (creamy with hint of vanilla, simple ingredients, great dessert) -Mango Tart  (seasonal, mangoes are nice and ripe, beautiful presentation) -Fruit tart (crust is buttery, love it, best crust I've had) -Apple pie (bf loves this, not loaded with spices, best eaten warmed at home) -Strawberry Mille crepe cake -Green tea cake (preferred the version they had when they first opened) -Coffee jelly (fresh cream on side, non-coffee drinkers will like this too) -Creampuff -Yuzu panna cota (wasn't a fan, too tart for my taste)  Crepes are made to order. Light, simple, and with the right amount of filling/toppings; you can actually appreciate the taste of the actual crepe. It's the closest we can get to our favorite crepe place in San Francisco. We get the strawberry with homemade nama cream, sometimes with ice cream. Easy to eat when rolled into a cone.  If you dine in and have some things you want to-go, they'll store it in the case to keep it cool. Just remind them if they forget as you walk out.   Service is always great and polite.",

The strawberry cake my friend like was sold. The salesclerk told me that while not 100% guaranty, but it was pretty safe to expect they would have strawberry cake today. Here was how the conversation went down with her:  Me: Oh great! I can put the deposit down or pay the full amount now. So if you get the strawberry cake, please hold it for me. If not, then I will get a different...  Her (interrupted me): No. Sorry, we don't take prepayment. You have to pay tomorrow. We open at 10 am. You can call us to see if we have strawberry cake.  Me: OK... I will call you 10 am then. And I can order it over the phone right...  Her (Interrupted me again): No. Sorry, we don't take order on the phone. You have to be here.  Me: Well... I will be at DMV in the morning. No way I can get out before 10. Is there anything we can do to make this happen? Come on, please work with me.  Her: No. Sorry, we can't. You have to be here to pay for the cake.  Some customer service. Wondering if she just quite her gov job to work in here.  I was very unhappy with her assistance, and told her: Fine, I will order the cake some where else.  As I stepping out of the door, I heard her voice: Thank you~~   Thank me for taking my business somewhere else? Cool! You have it, along with all my friends!",

I have worked in a Michelin star restaurant, and in the industry for over 20 years in high end spots,  so i know what good food and service is all about. Cakes 6 stars, customer service 1 star!!! The owner which is a pastry chef there, also works out front on taking order, should just stay in the back, and hire someone with customer service skills. she has what we call in the business as tunnel vision. Every time i leave there, i leave piss off. if there was another Japanese pastry spot in town, i would switch right away. I hope she is reading this, because people that know me knows that i don't write reviews at all, but i felt that i had to write this. this is not just my feeling but a few of my friend feel the same way. You should have comment cards around and ask them to fill it out on food and service and what you can do to make the experience a lot better.",

    "text": "Good crepes, desserts are fine but overpriced. Coffee is delicious.   Met up with a friend at 10am, and since they open at 10 there was a short line. Did not have to wait long at all, which is great because that means they're truly ready to start once they open, unlike some businesses where if you're one of the first few orders it takes forever because the equipment is still warming/heating up.   I got the BAT savory crepe which was perfection. Very light and thin crepe that melded well with the filling (bacon, avocado, arugula, and sun dried tomatoes). the crepes are thinner, more elastic (in an appetizing way) and less sweet than your French crepe, and it was a great vehicle for my light breakfast (this would be a great second breakfast or mid morning snack. I was still slightly hungry when I got home). It's served rolled up like an ice cream cone, so it was easy to eat and not messy.   I also ordered a coffee and it was a pour over. Delicious smooth medium roast coffee.   I wasn't a huge fan of the two types Of cake. I purchased two slices of cake to bring home - the mango special of the day and the strawberry thousand layer cake. The mangoes in the mango came were really sweet and fresh, and the cream was that fluffy not too sweet Asian-style cream, but it was still really heavy despite its light texture. the strawberry cake was okay too, but I'm not a huge fan of the strawberry syrup flavoring (that's what it tasted like, could be wrong). I've had the thousand layer cake from Lady M in Ny, and that was my standard. This fell short of that bc the strawberry cake had too much cream in between each layer, weren't enough layers in it, & you couldn't enjoy the feel of the layers in your mouth (that sounds weird but if you've had the Mille cake from Lady M Boutique in Ny you know what I mean). This strawberry Mille cake had layers that were thicker, spongier, and not as light.   Overall the cakes were fine if they were priced at $3.50 or lower. However, at $4.25 per small slice, my expectations were much much higher and the cakes fell short of that.   Service was great - friendly, polite, and quick.",

    "text": "I'm half scared to write this review in fear that my favorite Japanese bakery in Vegas will become overrun with hordes of people. Nonetheless, this place does really deserve recognition for their quality and service.  This very small shop only bakes a limited amount of pastries daily. They have their regular stock of goods daily such as the green tea cake, strawberry cream cake, and anko (red bean) cream puffs. The first two are good but not astronomically mind blowing and I would honestly skip the cream puff.  DAT APPLE PIE THOUGH. Rumored to be the best apple pie in Vegas, it looks deceivingly plain compared to the other desserts and pastries. Sitting directly on top of the refrigerated dessert display, one might make the unforgivable mistake of not even noticing the pie. Get it, try it, and love it! Ask them to warm it up for you in the oven if you plan on sitting and chilling there for a bit. If you're feeling like a slight masochist and glutton, add a scoop of vanilla ice cream to it as well. The crust is perfectly flaky but still not too dry. The filling has the perfect amount of sweetness. Combined together they make a heavenly combination almost as perfect as Brad and Angie, Elsa and Anna, peanut butter and jelly, hot cocoa on a cold rainy day, etc.   They also offer seasonal special pastries depending what fruits and produce are in season. For summer it's usually mango desserts and for fall it's kabocha (Japanese pumpkin/squash). My favorite specials are the mango tiramisu and the mango mille crepe.   As previously stated, they only bake small batches of goods so the earlier you go get your pastries, the better. They sometimes start running out of popular items around 2/3 p.m. You can call and ask them to reserve a certain pastry for you if you already know what you want.  Customer service is on point. The patissiere, the nice young Japanese lady, is always there whenever I go. She always greets everyone with a big smile.  You can really see she's got a passion for what she does.  Desserts are a bit more on the pricier side but then again, this is a small bakery that serves good quality goodies.",

All tables were occupied but they weren't busy at the counter. For having water available for customers is a plus! Much needed with all that sugar.   So the orders we DID get were AMAZING! We had about 7 different desserts too. Let's begin:  1. MANGO TIRAMISU $14.00 It is enough to feed 4-6 people. The crust is flaky, mango mousse inside is creamy and the mango fruit is fresh. (7 out of 10)  2. MONT BLANC $4.75 This is a chestnut cake with chestnut mousse and a piece of candied Japanese chestnut on the top. The lightness of the chestnut flavor might have been a bit too light. (6 out of 10)  3. YUZU PANNA COTTA $3.75 Suuper citrus-y, borderline subtle-y sour. Could be addictive, but maybe with a side of their whipped cream and it would balance sweet and sour. (6 out of 10)  4. FRUIT PARFAIT Good, but not outstanding. (3 out of 10)  5. CANNOLI CREPE W/ VANILLA ICE CREAM $5.50 MY CREPE! YUMMY! It was my favorite thing here I've tried ^_^ (10 out of 10)  6. CUSTOMIZED CREPE w/ Chocolate Syrup, Chocolate Crunchies, Chocolate Pocky, Whipped Cream and Vanilla Ice Cream $5.10 My niece's reply to her crepe - \"so so so so good!\" (10 out of 10 for her!)   7. CHOCOLATE CAKE $3.50 Chocolate-y, light + moist. A MUST-get! (10 out of 10)  Overall, will be back for the crepes and to try the strawberry shortcake. Place is definitely worth filling up my crepe stamp card for! Just make sure they put everything you ordered into it =P",

When I accidentally went there one hour before closing, all the popular items were gone and only a few pieces left but people kept coming after me one by one to snatch the past ones.",

    "text": "I came here with a relative expecting to enjoy some quick service pastries, and with the sophisticated decor, I was anticipating the pastries and crepes to come. The menu was rather small, it was a set menu of specials in addition to some regular items. The pastries looked fabulous inside of the display case. In addition to the crepes and pastries, they also had varieties of beverages that were interesting as well.  I've preciously enjoyed Japanese crepes before from many places, so I had some rather high expectations from the pricey options and higher-level atmosphere.  I had ordered a crepe with bananas, chocolate syrup, almonds, and whipped cream, with ice cream. My relative had ordered a small chocolate layered cake from the display case.   As for the crepe itself, the process looked very complex and took way too long. I waited as I watched a young woman making the crepe for over seven or so minutes, which is rather long for a thin crepe and some fresh fruit (keeping in mind we were the only ones in line). It was, however, a beautiful process as she lay the bananas down neatly and organized followed by whipped cream and chocolate syrup. While watching, one thing that did bother me was that she would fan the crepe to cool it down. By the time I received it the crepe was cold and also it was honestly rather tasteless. The bananas were ripe and the chocolate syrup was a bit overdone, but it was very difficult to enjoy with a cold and soggy crepe. I prefer my crepes a bit more cooked and also with some more flavor being the entire focus of the dish. The ice cream wasn't anything special either, just some typical green tea ice cream or something salted that was recommended by someone behind the register.   After having the tasteless crepe and overpowering chocolate syrup, I was expecting something better from the chocolate cake, perhaps something that came together a bit more, but I was wrong. Although the cake was soft, it was also tasteless.   The process took a long time, the crepe was cold, the food was tasteless, and no one bothered to check if anything was good, as a matter of fact, the staff themselves weren't that friendly either.   Not coming back any time soon. There are tons of better places out there.",

I've tried the green tea Mille crepe at other bakeries in town and no where comes even close to how they make theirs.  Their crepes are awesome!!

The sign says Crepes & Pastries, didn't know it was a quaint Japanese spot. Decided to try some cream puffs and strawberry shortcake to give to the boyfriend's parents. Being that they're Asian, I knew they won't be into the sweet stuff. Maaan I wish I bought more because all the desserts were soo DERISHUS!! (Delicious with a full mouth). The cream puffs were flavorful, not sweet and light. I was expecting liliha-style creamy and pudding like, but not these! Light and airy and made you wanna eat more! The shortcake was fresh and like the cream puffs not too sweet just like Old school Asians like it! Love this place! So glad I found it!",

This recent visit, total cost $15.50:  Cream puff - freshly made, great vanilla filling - rich and creamy.  a little pricey for what you get.  Chocolate cake - again, small portion, not a \"traditional\" chocolate cake - \"frosting\" was good, cake itself, a little dry.  Strawberry \"crepe\" cake  - multiple layers of crepe and strawberry cream.  The cream itself was amazing - i didn't care for the texture due to the crepes.  Fuji apple pie - looks nice.  could use some more apples, decent flavor - probably better warmed up with some ice cream.  Small shop, tucked away behind an oil change biz - unusual location.   French bakeries are more to my liking  pic added",

There's the pastry fridge where you can choose what delicious pastries to get, which is a very hard decision here. And then a glass window that shows the crepe being made right in front of you!  The service is wonderful, friendly, professional and sweet!  Now there pastries are so delicious! Not too sweet, soft, fresh, and just amazing! I love their red bean puff, strawberry cake, tofu cheesecake, and I used to get like a smore crepe which had my favorite marshmallows in them! Love this pastry shop!",

A small bakery with modern decor and friendly staff, the boyfriend, a few friends, and I came here for dessert.  I'd been admiring the coconut cake from afar via Yelp photos thus I knew I wanted a slice to go.  It was warm out, so I enjoyed a scoop of yuzu ice cream there, refreshing and light.  I very much appreciated the self-serve complimentary pitcher of ice water on the counter.  Everything in the case looked delectable with beautiful presentation.  I had my coconut cake today and it was delicious, a sponge cake with frosting that was not too sweet.  I didn't know they also offered sweet and savory crepes because I've only ever heard this place referred to as \"Suzuya,\" not by its full name, which is \"Suzuya Pastries & CREPES\" -now I know! I sampled the boyfriend's vanilla and chocolate crepe with vanilla ice cream and it was very good.  I look forward to our next visit when my goal is to get one of the crepes for myself as well as try their famous green tea cake.",

We tried the savory ham & cheese crepe & the strawberry crepe. Both very tasty. The crepe itself was light and cream was delicious. I'd of liked more strawberry flavor but it was good.  No one in the bakery could tell me the difference between the 2 versions and I suppose it doesn't really matter but why not just say crepes instead of adding the location?  We took hope a 4 pack of treats to give to our out of town guests tonight.  The down side? they are a bit pricy, their hours, for a city that never sleeps are a bit off and for me personally it's a bit of a schlep.",
