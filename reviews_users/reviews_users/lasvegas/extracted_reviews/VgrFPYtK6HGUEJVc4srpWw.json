I had a menu thrown at me after ten minutes of not even being greeted followed by the woman leaving to go carry on a conversation with another Asian table. She came back and said to me \"what you want\" I can't even explain how incredibly rude and discourteous this is. After ordering a bowl of Pho and a pot of hot tea she walked away and came back ten minutes later and threw a plate of shriveled up soup condiments on the table and slammed down a plastic water cup of hot tea. At this point I asked \"is this how you serve hot tea? Do you have a tea pot? A tea cup?\" Her response was to wave her hand around and say \"ya ya\" and turn to talk to the other table again. I walked out. I will NEVER tell anyone to go there. I will NEVER GO BACK!! Customer service is key in this town and when you treat customers poorly they don't return. I won't be surprised when the place closes down.",

    "text": "Firstly let me say I wish there was a 3.5 star rating on yelp. Because this place is def a 3.5. Not quite a 4 but not a 3 either. So I defaulted to 3. I grew up eating viet food in northern cali, so id like to think I know what good viet food is. Its starting to get pretty hot outside so Pho is out of the question,  so I decided to get some refreshing viet items. I had the shrimp and pork spring rolls and vermicelli w grilled pork and egg roll. Everything tasted good enough but felt as though could have been better. For instance the spring roll had great fillings big shrimp and freshly cooked noodles and lettuce but really lacked on the pork side. The vermicelli dish had alot of meat but had way too much vegetables for the amount of noodles I received. id say I received 50% meat, 35% veggies, and 15% noodles. The flavor of the meat was great, very tender not much fat *which is nice bec most of the time thit nuong is fatty* , most of this i could get past buuuuut the nuoc mam (fish sauce) that came with it was pretty bad. It was really sour, too sour, seemed like they needed to add more fish sauce and sugar to take the lemon bite down. Kinda killed the whole dish for me, as that is a staple thing in Bun. Hence why I leaned towards a 3 versus a 4. I think that it would be a great alternative to Chinatown for the southwest folks like myself, if they had a couple little tweaks. That being said having been to ALL the other Pho places in the southwest, Annie's the clear winner. Ill definitely be back to try their pho, but probably wont get any dish that requires nuoc mam.",

However, my wife and I were here kinda late last Saturday after watching a concert and we were told \"closing  in 10 Min\". So we decided to take out the food instead, but we were definitely disappointed to learn that they've only put like four small thinly slices of beef wrapped on clear plastic plus three small slices of tendon! We thought maybe they ran out of meat since they were closing or they're just skimpy on meat now that they have frequent customers! I've eaten at various Pho places and they are generous and reasonable with meat servings! Never going back that's for sure! Better to go at Bamboo Bistro!",

The pho is always as good as I remembered and less than $8 ! It is a total steal! The chicken curry soup was absolutely delicious!  It reminded me of home.  I don't think I have had it anywhere else in Vegas.  The soup was a bit thicker than the usual pho broth, but it tasted really good! There is a lot of chicken in the soup too, so it really helps you fill up.   The chicken wings are also delicious!  They are fried to perfection and topped with garlic butter sauce.  It's worth every penny !   The owners are also very nice! Make sure you guys give this place a try!",

Before I use to either go to Jenny pho or drive half an hour or more to get to china town for some good pho. Not any more, pho Annie has been here for I think more then a little under a year and a half but it is my go to spot.   The pho here is in my opinion way better then Jenny Pho. The flavor of the soup is always so good. The rest of the menu provides you with all your Vietnamese favorites and a wide verity of it too. The drinks are all good and they even serve fresh young coconut juice out a a coconut.   The Resturant is a bit small, it's a long narrow space and it can get a bit pack at times but it is worth it, and best of all Annie is always there and is always nice along with the rest of her staff. If you love pho and you are you haven't try Pho Annie and you are in the SW part of Las Vegas you must come here you won't be disappointed with food price or quality and quantity and if you aren't in the SW they now have a 2nd location in the SE area as well. So go!  What are you waiting for? You must go try them now.....go!!! ;0)",

I came in around 9pm and ordered shrimp spring rolls and chicken curry noodle soup. 5 minutes later I already got my order.   The shrimp spring rolls were huge! The peanut sauce is amazing here. 5/5 for these.   Chicken curry noodle soup: omg if anyone likes curry this is the thing to get. The flavor is so rich and delicious i scarfed down the whole bowl. I highly recommend getting this. 5/5!   Garlic chicken wings: they were pretty good. I did burn my tongue because of how hot they were. Lol. But that's a good thing how fresh they were :) I feel like they could've put a little sauce or something in it and maybe a little more garlic, but I love garlic so maybe that's why. I would say these get 3.5/5.   I'm also used to going to pho places and never getting checked up on. Our waiter came by a few times asking if we were okay. I'm so not used to that haha. So all In all if you're looking for some good pho with good service, swing by this place.",

You find annie in a small complex. You enter the store and voila, food....right? Wrong.  I don't know if it was just the day we went, but this place was severely understaffed. And by severely understaffed, I mean one waiter taking care of the entire restaurant with 3 or 4 people in the back cooking/handling to go orders...which leads me to the following points:  1) After being seated, we waited about 30 minutes to order. 2) After ordering, we waited another 30 minutes to get our food 3) Chicken curry pho is interesting, tasty, and new. $9 4) Pretty expensive pho for a small bowl 5) After devouring the pho, we waited 15 minutes for the check.  To the waiter's credit, he was friendly and calm given the circumstances. However, with the long trek from the strip, the pricey pho as compared to vegas Chinatown, and the super long waits, I'd pass.",

For appetizers, we got egg rolls. They were served with very little dipping sauce. I got grilled pork chop as my entree and I did not enjoy it at all. The pork was not tender, flavorless, and covered in oil. It came with sunny side up eggs and believe it or not, this was the best part of my meal even though I found lots of egg shells. When I told the employee about the egg shells, his response was, \"its small.\" Instead of being apologetic, he was very defensive. I found lots of tiny eggs shells. Our server also managed to serve me the soup that came with the entree. I even asked what the soup was prior to ordering. With that said, my soup came way after my entree has been served. I do not recommend this restaurant at all. I will not be going back.",

It's a little out of the way for me, but Henderson lacks good Vietnamese places. I would prefer Pho Annie to most Chinatown Vietnamese restaurants as well!   The service was efficient. They made sure our waters were consistently filled up. We came in a large group and they offered to ring us up separately at the cashier instead of having us trying to figure out how to split a check 9 ways. I love it when places offer to do this. Brownie points for them!  I had a standard Pho Tai (rare sliced beef) and wasn't disappointed. The broth was good and noodles were passable in my book. The rice dishes and vermicelli options also looked promising for my next visit.",

How my taste buds change! I've only been to three pho places in Vegas. I can't recall the ones I've been to in CA. This is my favorite one so far.   I consider myself a pho noob so I'm not sure what constitutes the perfect pho so if I'll just summarize it by saying this is some damn good pho!  I get good service here which is a bonus because we all know Asian restaurants are not known for their southern hospitality. When we first went, Annie was friendly and chatted with us. I had recently went in to take pho to go and the guy greeted me with a genuine smile. I got my order fast, between 5-10 minutes. He was thankful too. I really appreciate genuine customer service especially from an Asian restaurant. ;)",

    "text": "When the craving for pho hits and I am stuck at home, this is my go-to since it is in the Southwest. My first time here was during lunch on a Monday. The place was COMPLETELY PACKED. Every booth and table was taken which was very surprising, but in the end, our food came out promptly and service was the usual for an Asian restaurant (I'm Chinese so I'm allowed to say that).   We ordered 2 bowls of the house specialty pho and the pan fried seafood noodles. Everything was SO good. The noodles were fried into a bowl shape and had a lot of shrimp, squid, fish, and an abundance of veggies (which I love). When you smash the fried noodles & stir it up with the seafood sauce, they turn into half crunchy/half tender noodles. The consistency was so good that I barely got a couple of bites in before my kids gobbled it all up. The pho was pretty good with the meat all very tender and not chewy (like when you just chew so much and force yourself to swallow because it's not falling apart enough, no, that never happened). The broth was good, although I tend to just take a preliminary taste before I dress it up with japalenos, lime, sriricha, and hoisen sauce.   The second time we went back was on Mother's Day at about 6PM. There were only 3 other tables there? I was wondering if I had missed something & if this place was closed down by the health district or something prior to our visit. Hopefully not. This time around, we ordered boba milk tea (75% ice, stop being so stingy), and the same order as last time + spring rolls. The spring rolls are standard, but served with extra lettuce to wrap around the spring rolls. Sure, I'm down to eat extra lettuce whenever I can, although others may not like it. The pho was the same as last time, but the seafood noodles were different. They had beef in them and bbq pork. It was lacking most of the seafood in the \"crispy pan fried seafood noodles\", and just tasted way different. I'm going to go again and order all the same stuff and decide if I should keep this spot on my radar. I wish the food was more consistent, but for now, I'll say it's alright.",

A quick look at the yelp app and Pho Annie was a short drive away from the strip. It sits at in this little plaza with a couple of other restaurants and plenty of parking.  When you walk inside, you may or may not be greeted by anyone, so you just sit down wherever you like. There was one guy waiting all the tables, but he seemed to be pretty efficient at handling everyone. He brought us our drinks and  then shuttled off to another table. Then came back a few minutes later for our main order. The menu is pretty typical of what you'd find at any Pho restaurant. I didn't see Pho combination bowls that had everything like tendon, rib, tripe, meatballs, brisket and the like. It was more like getting one or the other. We ordered a set of crispy summer rolls with shrimp and they came out all hot and steamy fresh out of the fryer. The time intervals between ordering seemed to be decent. After the rolls were gone, out came the Pho and they regularly made sure that your cup was filled with drink.  When the Pho came out, the meat was still pink as they put it in at the last minute, the tendon was just right and the broth had that cinnemony anissy taste  that wasn't bad. They provided bean sprouts, lime and fresh basil. With a dollop of hoisin, a drop of chilli past (I opted this instead of the sriracha this time). It was pretty good.   So the service was efficient and the food did not disappoint. I'd stop here again.",

Lady told me they close at ten so I told her my order and she didn't want to accept it because she thought I would have gotten there after 10 haha. Denied!   So, obviously I'm never going there I told myself if they don't want my business...but out of convenience and considering a vegetarian friend we went and it confirmed my prejudice. Waiter told us they do not have a vegetarian broth, which the chef easily took care of after we told him to ask. He didnt know what kind of fish that they would put in a seafood veg soup. Friendly but knew nothing. Food was average. Safe to say I will not be satisfying my random Pho craving here again haha",

    "text": "New owners...used to be called Rainbow Pho.  The good thing about this Vietnamese Cuisine spot is that its close to the crib, otherwise, Pho87 is still hands down the best Pho joint in town.    What is nice about this place is that virtually nothing has changed but the name.  They have a diverse menu offering anything from Mango Salad (papaya salad with shredded green mango) to salt and pepper saba.    The pho selection is like any other except they offer some unique variations that I have not yet tried and can't recall the name...sorry, I know that isn't very helpful.  Otherwise, broth is ok...i'm not a critical broth nazi, but know good broth when I taste it.  But if I am feeling the urge, I can do with lower grade pho.    They have a descent crab noodle soup that I remember tasting when they were formerly Rainbow Pho...its was pretty good and tasted like bun bo hue.  Still, there are not many Vietnamese eateries in the deep Southwest of Las Vegas, so if you are hungry and don't want to drive to Chinatown, this place is worth a shot.  There is also Jenny Pho and Bamboo Bistro nearby.  The bubble tea is available in various flavors, I am not particularly fond of balls in my mouth, but I do recommend the three bean dessert drink...closest thing to halo halo.  They do have a drive through outside that I wish they implemented...but not sure if that will be a good or bad thing.",

I'm always surprised at just how quick they are able to bring our food out. Keeps us coming back. The vermicelli with grilled pork and egg rolls is one of my favorites cause you get so much variety and flavor in 1 dish. If I'm doing Pho, Rare Steak Spicy Sate Noodle Peanut Thick Soup is my jam! The menu can be a bit overwhelming because there are so many options. If it's your first time, the pictures on the menu are gonna be your best friend. Happy eating :)",

I got their spring rolls cuz well I LOVE me some spring rolls. And they were pretty good. The skin was a little on the chewy side the first time but I would prefer it chewy vs mushy. :)  For the pho.... I got the vegetarian one once and the rare beef the second time.  They were both very very good. The broth was good. I still think that pho so 1 has the best broth but Annie's comes pretty close especially seeing as how they are far from the Chinatown area.  So since Pho Annie is only 7 minutes away vs the 25 minutes to Chinatown.... Annie's it is!!!  :)  Overall... It's good!!! I will definitely be back!!! I'm looking forward to trying their vermicelli dishes next.... I'm just waiting for the weather to earn up a little.... When it is cold outside...I want my hot pho!!!! When my tummy is upset.... I want my Annie Pho!!!! :)",

I ended up ordering pho chin (well done beef slices) which was actually pretty good compared to the restaurants on Eastern and some places in Chinatown. The broth had a good amount of flavor and reminded me of the taste I thought I could only get at the Vietnamese restaurants back home. I usually don't get full after eating a bowl of pho, but this place gives a good amount to keep you satisfied for a while. I also got their spring rolls which were good, but I don't think it is worth the price. I paid about $5-6 for 4 pieces which looked like 2 pieces that were just cut in half lol. I also ordered the fried rice which was alright. It was nothing special and I probably won't order that again if I do come back.   The restaurant is relatively clean which is good because Asian places are known to not be as clean as they should be. The staff was nice which is a plus in my book. I'd recommend going here over places like Pho So 1, Pho Kim Long, or Lemongrass if you are craving for some authentic tasting pho. I would go more often if it was closer to me!",

Believe the hype. I came all the way out here for this dish alone. Lahhhvvved it. Big pieces of whole chicken with big flavor. Lots of noodles and a warm, comforting broth. Guess what? I feel better. Soup cures!    Good food combined with fast, friendly service. I am happy to rate this place 5***** because it is well deserved.

    "text": "I was in a hurry, but I still managed to pull off a meal here in just over half an hour.  My friends and I wanted to meet up for lunch, and they picked Pho Annie in spite of having just come from Southern California, which is one of the great centers of Vietnamese cuisine in this world. Another friend had previously told me to try it, so I agreed. It's a nice, traditionally decorated shop on a relatively remote stretch of Rainbow Blvd. It has comfy, clean seats and tables.  Due to tight scheduling, we didn't really share lunch. I had to head to work soon, and they were running into all kinds of traffic and construction. Oh well. I ordered early when the server kindly asked me whether I wanted to order food. I had the pho dac biet ($8.25), my standard order these days.  I definitely enjoyed the broth (better without lime, after experimenting), the noodles were fine, the lime and Thai basil were fresh and tasty, and most of the meats were great. I only had a bit of a faux pas with the \"tai\" meat, the one that's served raw and cooked in the broth). It was bland before it fully absorbed the broth's flavor. Also, the portion size seemed a little bit on the small side. I might have been especially hungry, which could have biased me a bit, but I generally like to have large bowls of pho.  Overall, it was a good meal that I wouldn't be against having again in the future. I won't go out of my way just for this, but it'll certainly be an option if I'm in the area.",

We both ordered vermicelli bowls and some chicken wings for her daughter.   Food and service were sluggish, but we were engrossed in conversation so we didn't really notice. The meal itself was good, not great. Portions were generous but flavors weren't anything to write home about. We both left full and I'll likely order takeout here from time to time since it's convenient but I won't go out of my way.",

    "text": "Most of the great reviews here are from when it was Pho Annie. Well, Annie is gone; she is up the road at Pho 88, serving up some of the best pho in town. The question is: is Pho Aimie worth keeping on the pho rotation?  Sadly, the answer is no. Without Annie, the quality here has gone sharply downhill. The pho is bland, the tendon undercooked, the meat mediocre. The chicken pho is downright bad: dry, overcooked chicken in beef broth. The beef stew is... okay, I guess, but pretty much everyone else in the area does it better. There just isn't anything to come here for.  With Pho 88 and Jenni Pho so close, and WTPho and Pho Saigon 8 not much further, why come here? No reason at all. I kept coming perhaps longer than I should have, but it's time to let go.",

But the broth on the rare steak noodle soup was so oily, you could see the oil sitting on top of the broth and not only that oil over powered the flavor of the broth.   Then nothing really seemed fresh. The jalapenos looked like they were cut and sitting out for at least a day. They were shriveled and the seeds were a brownish color and same with the sprouts, they were a light brown and rubbery.   Unfortunately I won't be returning here.

    "text": "A good Pho restaurant in Vegas?! Can it be??  Yess!!   It's about time that I write a review about this place. I live right down the street so you'll find me here for dinner if I'm too lazy to drive out or cook for myself. Their location is great for me, but for the masses they are at a huge disadvantage. They are located on the south side of town, 20 minutes or so away from Chinatown, which is where most people who seek out Vietnamese or any type of Asian food will go. They are also hidden in a complex where there storefront cannot be seen from the street.  When it comes to Vietnamese food, I am quite spoiled. I grew up on my grandma's homemade Pho, so most Pho restaurants in Vegas don't even compare. Pho Annie though...hits the spot! Satiates that craving.   When I order a bowl of Pho, I like it to be perfect without me having to add any of the condiments available. Hoisin and sriracha should be a dipping sauce for the meat not to flavor the diluted bowl of broth that some places try to serve. Of course everyone has their preferences but regardless the foundation of the dish has to have substance to begin with.   Their broth is perfectly balanced...very hearty and full of flavor (but not salty) unlike many other restaurants that will serve diluted broth or broth that tastes like MSG. The noodles aren't soggy or undercooked and the vegetables are fresh. Everything just comes together.   Service could be better, but Vietnamese restaurants are notorious for awkward service. The servers do not look you in the eye when they are talking to you or taking your order. They most likely won't be checking up on you. HOWEVER...you will get your food within 5-10 minutes...which is nice.   If you're looking for authentic Vietnamese food, seek Pho Annie!!",

Few places get the broth right and they do a great job with their flavors.  - Fried chicken wings. Their chicken is so crispy on the outside and juicy on the inside. Again, great with flavors.  Cons - The service is okay. A bit on the slow side and seem disorganized. - Not the best looking. There's duct tape holding their booths together and it's not entirely clean. - Questionable things. Their iced coffee (ca phe sua da) is pre-made, poured into a plastic cup unlike the traditional hot coffee, french drip, self poured over condensed milk and ice. I believe they do this to save on time, but it takes away from the experience and taste of the coffee.  Stars for good food, but I wasn't truly a fan of their service and appearance. This is really more of a 2 1/2 star rating from me.",

    "text": "FINALLY! I have found a place where I can truly enjoy a nice bowl of pho! If you know anything about my pho searching journey in Vegas, you'd know that I've been pretty disappointed with every experience I've had at a Vietnamese restaurant thus far. But eureka! Pho Annie does it for me.   First off, we need to cover location because it is not an easy find. Complex is rather odd. It's almost like the complex curves toward the street with Pho Annie tucked on the inside hidden from the street view.  Just look for Chee Burger Chee Burger, it's in the same complex.  Restaurant isn't large 5-6 booths on the left, 3-4 tables on the right. First visit was during lunch and it got packed fast. Second visit was on a Sunday night and it was much slower. I order the Annie Special pho that includes all meat additions (tripe, fatty brisket, tendon, meat balls, flank). In Houston, we are given the option of small bowls or large bowls for pho and this would definitely be considered as the large bowl. The bowl costs around $7. I order the egg rolls as an appetizer and they're great -- comes with 4 large egg rolls. Keep in mind pho doesn't take long to prepare at all so your main course will most likely follow the app within 5-10 minutes.   It's really hard to describe the taste of the broth. All I can really say is that I truly enjoyed it. It had the perfect amount of flavor and I actually sipped on it after I ate up everything else.   And if pho isn't your thing, they have a wide selection of other dishes. Can't go too much in detail of that for ya cause I didn't pay close attention.. sorry!  My favorite pho place so far! The only downfall is you have to spend a minimum of $10 to use your credit card.",

A modest amount of saltiness completely complemented by the robust beefy flavor and judicious spices make this Pho worthy of praise.  Very busy when I go in most times, and seating can be limited. A trendy, popular place for a good reason: good food!",

    "text": "This is my third time here.  The last two were about a 4 - fast service, courteous, and attentive.  This last time was a 2 at best - but it was also a Saturday night after Christmas.  I thought it was fair to average the score.  When we arrived there was a wait - about 7 people were waiting in the doorway.  There was no one taking names.  As more people came in, I asked if anyone was going to start taking names so they know who was there first and he replies \"oh ok - good idea.\"  About 15 minutes later we sat down.  I quickly ordered some appetizers as we were hungry.  Fried egg rolls, fresh spring rolls and pot stickers.  The spring rolls were pretty good but the egg rolls and pot stickers were just ok.  The appetizers came out real fast.  We got waters right away.  I then ordered our dinner.  We ordered two orders of pho (rare meat and rare meat and tripe) a grilled shrimp dish, salt and pepper squid and beef chow fun.  The shrimp came out first.  two skewers with 4 small pieces on it.  The shrimp wasn't bad, just small.  The meal came with soup which I believe is just the broth from their pho but for some reason, this broth was yummy and flavorful - and our two bowls of pho tasted as if they started to run out of broth and they added some hot water.  Very disappointing.  The squid was average.  It wasn't greasy and it was well cooked, however the squid itself was chewy.  The chow fun never came out even after I reminded them twice and after we were done with our meal I asked someone to cancel it.  About two minutes later, another server came by and said they were really busy in the kitchen and my noodles will be another 10 minutes.  sigh.  To be fair, the times before the pho was great. Rare steak was fresh and not chewy. Had the duck pho and that was really good. Lots of meat. Perfect seasoning.   Not sure if it was because they were busy, but be that the food quality and service went down drastically I hesitate about returning.",

I ordered the rare steak and beef strip pho and my boyfriend got potstickers.   Apparently our server was hard of hearing because I ended up with rare steak and tripe. Not worth pointing out their mistake. I was scared I'd have my food spit in. The only redeeming thing about the dish was it wasn't overly salty so they probably held back on the MSG, ha. The potstickers weren't tasty either. 6 oily pieces came to an order.   Price was on par with other pho places. But I still wouldn't recommend this place.",

    "text": "My new favorite Pho spot in Vegas.  Pho around the valley usually has the same base broth taste, same egg rolls, which isn't a bad thing at all.  Pho Annie ticks off all the blocks on taste, price, and ambiance one would expect from a Vietnamese restaurant in Vegas.   Portions were definitely on the larger side as well.  1 thing however stood out, and that one thing is what will keep me coming back.  The service. AMAZING service. Great Customer service and very accommodating. Our party had 5 adults and one 14 month old girl. The food ordered came out on time. Our drinks were refilled throughout our meal, and any requests we had we met with pleasant service; which as a lot of us know, is not always a given when it comes to Asian dining :P  Vegas is a service industry city, and Pho Annie sets the bar high. I've been to almost all the Pho restaurants in the Vegas Valley since 1995, my main haunts used to be Pho Kim Long (Until they raised their prices) and then Pho Saigon (Until the broth got too sweet and it was just depressing eating there...).  You won't be disappointed. I promise you.",

The sauce for those was a bit different from the regular sweet chili sauce we are use to, but it was pleasantly delicious.   Cons - very small restaurant with the capacity of 49 people (I guess that would be if every table had 4 per seating. Sunday night every table was full at 745pm and there were two other families trying to be seated (one of 3 and one of 4). This made for slow response from the waiter to come and take our To-Go order. It wasn't too terrible a wait but it did take 10 minutes for them to come over and ask what we needed.  The Parking lot is huge, as it is sitting next to the Lodge on Shelburne. So there is plenty of parking. They do take credit cards and cash. The staff is pleasant (those we spoke with). Our Order was ready in 15 minutes.  We will definitely be going back so we can try other options on their menu.",

Pulling up in the parking lot you notice that the Drive Through has been blocked. That was her first smart move!  Upon entering hubby and I were greeted and taken to one of the many comfortable booths.  We were given Rainbow Pho menus and they are bright colored and a little confusing. Hubby asked for somthing on the menu and she said \"ewwww that's not good we are taking that off the menu\". We chuckled and started asking was is really good and so hubby just asked for his usual Vietnamese love.....Pho Ga Chicken :)  I skimmed down the menu and hubby spoke up and said \"beef chow fun\" yummmmmm yes I will take it!  We were asked if we would like to start with Spring Rolls or an app. I said soft spring rolls and with no Shrimp. She offered Tofu and our order was on the way back to the kitchen :)  We both ordered just water to drink but yummy looking bean drinks and coconut water etc kept coming out. Grrrr we will have to go back :)  I noticed immediately that the items on the table were individually wrapped chopsticks, two big bottles one with hosin and the other with sriracha. Two small glass dishes with spoons, one held bonito type fish flakes in a dark fish oil, the other one held very spicy yummy red chili sauce. Yummmmmm my kinda condiments.    Our spring rolls came out and two side plates and two bowls of yummy peanut sauce. The sauce was not too thick and not too thin. The peanut flavor was there but not over powering. The soft spring rolls were filled with green leaf lettuce, chrispy tofu, yummy thin rice noodles, and some mixed veggies...the standout was the hidden Thai basil in them.  At this point we knew we would be cray cray about this place and it's dangerously close to our house :D  Hubby's Pho came out and I noticed that the broth immediately filled the room.....I was thinking \"I must try that\" so we both dug in and found slow cooked tender chicken and tons of thin rice noodles. The Pho was PERFECT. After ooooing and aaaaaaing. My dish came out.  My beef Chow Fun was perfect. The taste of wok/boarder line grill and the perfect amount of green onion, beef and yummy flat noodles. This dish actually blew away the Chow Fun that I eat at my fav San Fran Chinatown spot........now that is hard to do.  The price was about $27.50 and I had leftovers to snack on later (I stay up very late) or for lunch the next day. About $6 for the rolls, I think there were six. About $9.99 for the chicken Pho and $7.99 for the chow fun.  Big portions, we both could only eat half the rolls and maybe half the chow fun. Hubby def did good on the Pho and he said that out of any he has had in the world.....it was the best.  As a matter of fact........ The next night hubby asked to go there again LOL!!!! :D  For a picky eater like him......that is really saying something :D  TOTES YUM!!!!!! GO GET SOME!!!!!!",

I am not a huge fan of pho because of the some broths tasting  too gamey for me, so I was looking for a pho restaurant that served more than pho. Thanks Yelpers! My husband had the beef brisket in chicken broth. I tried it and it was delicious and no gamey taste. I had the kalbi ribs with rice and it came with eggs over easy. Tender and just the right amount of sweetness on the ribs. The fried rice with Chinese sausage was good also! They give huge portions. We brought half of our dishes home. Staff was attentive. We would come back again and have pho in this 107 degree weather!",

Service overall was good. Courses came out as they were ready so my poor mother had to wait another 10 minutes for her meal while we were all rudely slurping away on our pho. The pho was large portions but the soup was on the light side and not as a flavorful as I expected. I see the reviews for bad service, but ours was fine and they even apologized for how busy it was and how it may have affected their presence at our table. I think food-wise there are probably more outstanding options but Pho Aimie is not a bad choice for those who live in the neighborhood.",

The restaurant is nice and quiet and service was decent.  Everything was going great until we decided to open the packaging for their chopsticks.  This was the nastiest thing I've seen in awhile lol.  We literally opened ten chopsticks and EVERY single one of them had this weird black mold growing on it.   that was the look on all our faces.  We even tried grabbing from the surrounding tables.    When the waiter walked by he looked at it and said oh yea... I guess I'll go get you guys regular chopsticks and he never came back.  My wife had to get her own fork from their utensil table.  So yes. We had to eat pho with forks. Lol.  We wanted to leave but the food had already been served and the waiter disappeared after the chopstick incident until it was time for the check.  If you're gonna go check them out just bring your own utensils lol or go somewhere else. That would be the better option.",

Unfortunately, food was pretty hit or miss for us.  Dishes weren't coursed, and Neli got her #16 Pho pretty quick, only to be followed by our fresh shrimp spring rolls (which were the best item we tried). Several minutes later, my Yellow Noodle Duck Soup (a featured special) arrived at the table. Both soups were hot, and I really liked the broth, but neither of us finished our meats- the duck was a generous portion but not particularly flavorful and somewhat tough and dry. There was a huge amount of noodles, though, making the portion even larger than expected.   Total bill for two was around $30, not bad pricing. I'd consider coming back for the rolls and maybe a rice bowl or another appetizer, but the soups just didn't live up to the hype for us.",

I came here the other day because I was craving curry and Vietnamese food- I yelped and out popped pho Annie, a place where I can get chicken curry with pho noodles and it was fantastic!!! My boyfriend went with me and he got the beef stew and that was yummy as well!  The broths for both our meals were full of flavor and depth- reminds me of my parents home cooking! The only thing about the chicken curry is I would probably put a tiny bit more broth to it because it was kind of thick. Other than that, amazing!  The staff were nice and the place was nice and clean!!! All in all, I will be back again for more and prices were fair too! I think my chicken curry was $8.99 for a large bowl and they were very generous with the chicken! Stephan's beef stew had tender pieces of beef that was cooked to perfection as well and was plentiful!!!",

They did not come with a dipping sauce so I just started trying all the ones on the table to figure out which one went with it, without success. I don't usually eat this kind of food so excuse my ignorance.   For lunch I had the chicken curry soup. It's a thicker soup that comes out piping hot so hold your horses. It was just a little spicy. Chicken wings with skin fill the bottom of the bowl. I had to get back to work and did not want to dirty my hands so I picked the best I could with my utensils.

Forgot to ask for it without peanuts (allergy) and it came out drenched in peanuts. Most places just sprinkle a little on the top. I apologized profusely and asked of I could have it without nuts.

There are not a lot of Vietnamese restaurants on Rainbow and on this side of town, but this restaurant is stand out. Their Bun Bo Hue is the best in town in my opinion. Very authentic!!! All of the rice dishes are great. Pho is much better than Jenni pho. Wonton soup is great. Hu tieu Bo kho is decent. Alot of noodle though. The service is fast. I only gave 4 stars because the hu tieu satay was not good.",

    "text": "No longer will I need to travel all the way to china town for good pho.  This place has everything that you would expect from an Asian restaurant.  Great food, oriental atmosphere, servers that barely speak English and mediocre service...lol.  To compare the food i'd have to say its a little better than Pho Kim Long, except for the calamari.  I don't know what Pho Kim Long does to their calamari but theirs just can't be beat.   Annie's Pho however is extraordinary; always on point.  Most pho for me is a hit or miss on the broth (e.g. jennie pho) but Annie has never disappointed.  I like the fact that they include the soup with all their rice dishes as well.  So I never have to order a big bowl of pho if i just want the soup.  Very convenient for me.  The main difference with Annie is that its just once size bowl.  So you have no choice but to have a big bowl of pho everytime.  Oh and they have duck... i love duck.  It's not on the menu but for those in the know, know.  The have pho with duck as well.  Nothing fancy here, just a quarter duck served in pho, but i still like.  Their portions are bigger than Pho Kim Longs as well.  Their Charbroiled Pork Chop with egg comes with 2-3 pieces of pork chop and 2 eggs compared to Pho Kim Longs 1-1 1/2 pieces and one egg.  Oh and its cheaper too.  Spring rolls are pretty much the same as everywhere else.  The Mango Shrimp Salad is a must have every time I go there.  Sweet with a little sour and just oh so good.  Annie is usually there, i take that back, Annie is always there making sure everyone is being taken care of.  I always like to see this in a small business owner.  She puts in the work.    Some of the other employees...eh...not sure if they are all their sometimes.  This one server, my gf spoke to him in Vietnamese and in English and he still didn't understand.  We had to point and use hand signals... really weird.  He was good at keeping my water filled though.  I know we've all experienced the server not understanding you in these kind of restaurants so I can't really explain.  Its part of the experience I guess.  Food takes a while sometimes but everything is made fresh and they come out sporadically.  No waiting till every ones food is ready.  You just gotta be ready to eat when it comes.  All in all I have a 4 star experience at Pho Annies on the average.  If it wasn't for the  delay in receiving the food and the random slow acting server i would have given it a 5.",

I wonder if the broken rice is bought broken or they break it in the restaurant, message me if you think you have the answer, I am curious.  Restaurant has the sweetest staff.  Ingredients fresh.

Although the place is not very large, it can accommodate small parties quite comfortably. I can never find myself to stray from my usual bowl of Pho and that is exactly what I ordered. I usually frequent Pho So 1 but this place seemed like it deserved a try and I'm glad I did. I will probably choose this place for my Pho fix if I am coming from home. For ~$8 (average price), I had a good sized helping of noodles and meat. The broth itself was slightly oily for my taste and there appeared to be no MSG. I enjoy Pho both with and without MSG, but I do prefer without because of the cotton mouth feeling I get after eating MSG.   So the verdict? Long wait to be seated, long wait to order, long wait to receive the check but my patience probably needs practice anyway. I'll be back, pho-sho.",

I love beef stew and since they threw some noodles in with the beef stew it made it like no other beef stew I've ever had. Was it the best beef stew I've had? No but it was different and very enjoyable that I wanted more. Technically its pho, it was under the pho section on the menu but I wouldn't call it your typical pho it was thicker, I dont think Ive seen any other pho place serve it, and I won't add those usual pho ingredients and hot sauces. Those in the group who ordered the pho seemed like they enjoyed it but I already know what I'll get here.  They make other non-pho items like various pad thai and various Asian dishes which looks good from the pictures. The prices are reasonable and a decent place 3.5 star. It does feel and look like a dirty place. I'm a little curious how the health place feels about Annie Pho but if I didn't get sick I'm OK with going here again. There's not a lot of pho places in the area so I'll throw them in my rotation being all cold outside right now.",

An expansive (but not expensive) menu of pho along with delicious appetizers to choose from (the Vietnamese spring rolls are fresh and delicious) makes this an easy week night outing or a chill weekend meal. The chicken curry pho, as many have mentioned, is seriously tasty with massive pieces of chicken and a perfectly seasoned broth. ADDICTIVE.   Resist the urge to get take out so you can slurp your noodles free of judgment, I felt the portions were a bit smaller for the same price and you miss out on all the accoutrements like hoisin sauce, sprouts and limes.",

It is located on Rainbow and after Windmill where a lot of homes and businesses are located. The owners did a great job with location because the area is always busy. The restaurant also welcomes you with a clean area and friendly workers who make you feel comfortable. I am very impressed with the location and decor of the restaurant.  Quality: At first, my friend told me to go to the restaurant but I was hating because I did not care for which \"pho\" restaurant I go to. I thought it all tasted the same, but was  I WRONG! There is something about their broth that is very different from all the other Vietnamese pho restaurants I have been to (not to mistake Cambodian pho... because it is THE BEST PHO)! The food is so good here. I have tried their pho, rice dishes and basically everything on their appetizers. I also have tried their coconut desserts and their delicious Vietnamese coffee!  Service: The service here is fast and convenient. I never have to worry to get my water cup filled or if I need something, someone is always there to tend to me. It is a family owned business so there is always someone who is taking care of me when I come. I love their service and how they take care of their customers no matter how busy the restaurant can get!  This is my favorite pho place and I cannot wait to try their other items on the menu. This is definitely a place to give a try from the other common pho places in Las Vegas!",

You'll be lucky to even catch them glimpsing to see if you're okay on water. After two years of coming here, no more. Good luck!",

It was 8pm on  Saturday night and they were busy! We were lucky and didn't have to wait for a table. Right away they brought water and ask if we want to order so we got some lychee drinks (lychee and ice with a boba straw) refreshing, saved mine mostly for the ride home. We ordered the shrimp spring rolls which were fresh and delish that they serve with a sweet peanut sauce. Also gotta have pho, we got the seafood. It was good but not crazy about it, I will stick with the beef next time. We wanted to not just have pho so we stepped it up and got the pork chops it came with fried egg rice veggies and soup for like $10! And it was really really tasty! Also the service was good and friendly. We felt welcomed and appreciated!  Im knocking a star because we waited for the veggies for the pho. And the old coffee shop decore doesn't go but it does give it some character!  I am excited its on the south side of town. We will be eating here and ordering pick from here often!",

Calling in was an \"experience\" I would liken to speaking to someone whose English is just OK while they're at a rock concert; lots of \"WHAT?!\", \"REPEAT?!\"Surprisingly he got the order factually correct but forgot the broth and I had to return.  I had the the recommended Chicken Curry Noodle Soup. It should be noted the chicken pieces are rough cut with bone in. It has a traditional appeal but it was delicious and I will frequent again despite certain limitations I have come to expect from Pho restaurants. It's small, family staffed and very busy with a lot of turnover. Call ahead and get it to go. 15-20 minutes.",

I really like the com thit nuong here because it comes with an egg on top, and you can ask for cha on the side. They don't have bi, however, which is a shame because that is a Vietnamese staple. The owners seemed pretty nice (from our minimal interaction over the phone), and spoke to me politely in Vietnamese. I also like that they have the option of getting a large pho broth on the side for less than $3 if you're not really up for eating pho noodles and want other entrees - although, the pho broth needs a little work because I can only drink so much before I get that overwhelming MSG taste. Hey if I can get my Vietnamese fix on this side of town, then I'm not going to be complaining too much!",

In fact, the few restaurants in this area have 4+ yelp ratings.  Because of its location, it makes a \"best kept secret\". Truly a neighborhood gem. I'm looking forward to winter and the cold weather to enjoy this Asian comfort food.   And the customer service? Outstanding!",

Pho Aimie was only 7 minutes away from my vacation house so it was easy to get there. Also, we were able to order and get our food within 10 minutes. I ordered the Pho Ga (Chicken Pho) with Vegetarian broth since I do not eat beef. The soup tasted just like the regular chicken pho which was perfect. I also ordered a side of egg rolls to share with my boyfriend.  The noodle portion was perfect and seemed like a lot, especially for the price. The customer service was great as well. I can not wait to be back for a hangover cure next month!",

The wings came out hot so be careful when diving in right away.  The flavor (not too garlicky) and crispiness was excellent (I usually order my wings well done but it's not needed) - 3/5.  The chicken pho originally comes with beef broth but you can ask for chicken broth as a substitute.  The broth is delicious, probably the best chicken pho I have ever had in vegas - 5/5.  The service was also excellent!",

Sometimes we get their garlic chicken appetizer which is super delicious.   The service is a hit or miss.

Years ago I lived sooooo close to this place and always seemed to drive right passed it. I even dined at that Cheeburger place (gross) once.    As I walk in and survey the area, I see that the dining area is a little small. Lots of the tables were occupied. Decided then that I'll take my order to go, since I was alone anyway. I did like that they had some college basketball on the tv...major props for that. Place looked very clean and well kept...another plus in my book.   My chopstick skills suck, so I was glad to take my order to go and just save the embarrassment of me getting stuff everywhere but my mouth. I ordered the chicken curry soup. Normally, soup is something you don't take to go. It needs to be nice and hot, straight out of the kitchen (also, one sharp turn in my GTI and it could be all over my interior). The order didn't take long to be prepared. Got home and put all the ingredients together. This soup is amazing!  I don't wanna sound corny, but I'm gonna be on my Guy Fieri ish.. Pho Annie too me to flavor town! There was such an array of flavors, from the chili sauce, to the curry, to the jalapeno, to the lime. Everything came together so perfectly. I even enjoy having the chicken not boneless. It's like a little soup scavenger hunt to find the chicken and tear it apart with your hands.   Great food. I will return. Looking forward to trying the other dishes available.",

I enjoyed the beef balls.  Most specials/dac biet don't include them. My boyfriend strayed from the norm and got their curry noodles, which is a special item. It is a coconut based curry soup with chicken. My boyfriend friend enjoyed it, but I say mama makes it better. ;) I would suggest it if you are feeling like pho but want soup noodles.",

Service is a hit or miss, since they always seem to be short-staffed. Just last night I saw a potentially large party leave since they weren't acknowledged for a long time. I also had to flag down a server multiple times to get the soup that was supposed to come with our order, and re-ask for our drinks (even after that, we were still one short). One of the empty plates we had weren't thoroughly cleaned and had remnants of a spring roll wrapper on it, we didn't even bother letting them know about the issue. In any case, the food is pretty consistent. I prefer the pork rice plate which comes with an over easy egg and a side of plain broth. My husband likes the shaken beef, which is a higher quality beef. Parking is easy here and  they do take-out so shaky service aside, people will still keep this place busy.",

Are her dishes as good as my mom's? Hmm, not quite, but who's ever is, right??   Anyways, I've tried the chicken pho (pho ga), crab soup (bun rieu), grilled pork with rice (com thit nuong), combo beef pho (dac biet) and  the roast duck/wonton egg noodle soup (Mi Vit quay).  My favorite? For sure, the roast duck and wonton noodle soup- which is more of a Chinese dish than Vietnamese BUT, it actually is pretty damn tasty and I don't have to drive to Chinatown each time I'm craving duck :)  But all the other dishes are actually not bad either- I've had bad pho before and theirs is not bad at all, in fact, it's good enough that I actually brought my mom there!  Let's just say it started off a little rocky with mom, but overall she said it's pretty good and that the soup base for the wonton noodle and her chicken pho had lots of flavor. Guess that's a win :)",

Affordable, quick service and the food is always on point.   The only a few things that suck tho, the drive thru isn't open. Literally, its blocked with the boss or employees car. So, for the lazy people, you gotta go inside to pick up your food. Another thing, the restaurant is narrow so its pretty small inside leaving you feeling crammed. When waiting for a table on a busy night, prepare to stand by the entrance door to get a table. Lastly, the last time we ate there, our server smelt like overpowering cigarettes and our table was sticky....BUT, NOTE: the tables are always sticky.   Overall, I still recommend this place if you're in the area, Food is still yummy! Ratings go down for the other stuff",

    "text": "I was in the area for a meeting and decided to stop in for lunch since this was right by. The reviews seemed good and I was really in the mood for Pho. I was escorted to my table quickly and the server took my ordered right away. Within five minutes I had my stealing bowl of Pho with accompaniments. After the first sip of the broth I knew I had just tasted the best Pho in Vegas! I have tried different Pho in China Town but NONE compare to Pho Annie! The meat was tender and the accompaniments were fresh. The jalapeno slices had just enough kick to round out the broth. And that broth... Wow, they have it perfected. I have bookmarked this place in the hopes of remembering to eat here again when I'm in the area. This place is a most stop for anyone who enjoys a good bowl of Pho!!!",

Now, i'll give them the benefit of the doubt and chalk the slow service up to what seemed to be a pretty sudden rush of guests, but it did take me over twenty minutes to be greeted and get my order taken, which was a bit offputting, and constitutes most of my reasoning for the 3-star rating. At least greet someone when they are waiting at the counter.   When i did get greeted, i will say i was happy with how nice the gentleman was who finally took my order... and very apologetic!  Needless to say i was pretty hungry by the time i got to where i was going, and when i opened the expertly boxed-up food, it was definitely a generous portion and filled me right up! (i love the little sriracha and hoisin sauce packets!)   However, i found the broth to be sweeter than i like and the meat was fine but it seemed to be missing something overall. In this sense i much prefer pho saigon 8 in henderson or pho Kim Long in chinatown.  I am, though, fully willing to give them a second chance and maybe try the curry soup as I've heard it is to die for!",

I wanted it to be good because this restaurant is the closest place for pho near my house. But sadly it was just plain. The veggies and tofu were done right but the broth was basically tasteless. I felt like the only flavor in it was from all the sauces I kept adding, which of course unhealthily adds a bunch of sodium. I also ordered shrimp spring rolls. They too were very plain. I'm told they normally come with pork inside, but I had that exempted. It was just noodles, romaine lettuce and flavorless shrimp. I've had WAY better spring rolls.   My order was for take out. On the service side of things I have no complaints. They were fast and friendly, but I doubt I'll go back. They just weren't good enough on the veggie side of things.",

After reading the great reviews I though the food sounds like its worth the wait. When I got to my job our pho had none of the chicken or meat that we ordered so we only had the noodles and broth. I immediately called back and explained that I couldn't come back at the moment but what their procedures were for this. The guy told me that they were busy so to come the next morning and they would refund me. So I went and the owner Annie went completely crazy shushing me out saying that the guy who answered the phone didn't know what he was talking about and saying she didn't care what he said that she's in charge and she can't help us. I'm always very understanding but the manager clearly doesn't care about her guests.",

I'm only giving it four stars because I've only had pho at handful of other places. Otherwise, this would definitely be my first five star review.  I've seen reviews that service sucks at Pho Annie, but I have no idea where that's coming from. Have you been to Jason's Deli? Every time I come to Pho Annie (well, this week) they greet me at door in about 2 seconds and take my order within 2 minutes. Within about 5 minutes after you order you have your food. This place is sick.   I've been getting the steak and beef brisket pho (I think it's #16 or #17 on the menu). It's great and in pretty ridiculous amounts for only $6.99. You get a crazy amount of the soup and noodles plus the standard sides (bean sprouts, jalapenos - ask for more - and fresh Thai basil). It's just like sitting in the streets of Saigon or something the produce is so fresh . Freaking awesome! One my friends ordered the #1 (or as it seemed - mystery meat combo).  It was only described in Vietnamese on the menu. As a big fan of Thai food I figured from experience this was probably organ meats...and it was. Basically tripe, tendons (which look like wieners of an unidentified animal) and some roast beef in thin slices. If you're not adventurous, I wouldn't go for it your first time. It's also great that they don't ask you what you'd like to drink. They bring you water and that's what you have. I love that you don't have to make a decision between Pepsi or Sprite.  I also love the fact that  the ambiance is somewhat questionable. I'm pretty familiar with the area having lived in Spring Valley for a while and worked in the area as well for sometime. Everything in that area is very generic and nice - and incredibly boring. I hate that and prefer culture over comfort. The decor is sort of like Asian restaurant meets depressing IHOP booths, which I like a lot. However, it's incredibly clean, but small (love that).  Nevertheless, the kitchen is open viewing for all customers and looks really spotless with fresh sprouts, jalapenos and basil in full view.   I love Pho Annie and will probably come back for a long time. It's an awesome place with awesome food and awesome service. I'm sold.",

But we had their hu tieu Xao Chay which was really interesting! Their noodles were fried and cut into slices and the veggies were on the bottom which you ate together. This might not be on the menu but you can still ask them! The portion size was huge and I shared with my sister and we both got full. We also got some yummy fresh fruit drinks. My sister got the fresh coconut juice that came in a coconut and I got their lycee drink. Both were refreshing! The service was nice as well.",

    "text": "Been coming here for a long time but don't think we will return. Mainly only dine here due to proximity to home. Quick and easy to get to. When we first started dining here, service was great and food was pretty decent. Annie, the owner, gives great service and constantly smiles and is courteous and gracious. She remembers my family and where we prefer to sit whenever we dine in. Although we've had some positive experiences, we've also had just as many negative ones. On several occasions when we order for take out, there is often confusion or problems with our order..and we only order 2 things! I blame this mainly on the guy that takes our order. I don't know his name but my guess is by the way he is dressed and the tasks he handles, that he is related to the owner, Annie. I don't know if he's a brother, or a husband, but he's mainly the one seating and waiting on customers other than Annie. This guy is awful. Messed up our order several times..simple things like, no onions in our Pho, or extra sauce, chapsticks..wrong amount provided on the phone for the bill, arriving to pickup takeout order and not being acknowledged (last time I stood there for almost 10 mins before I was approached, and he looked right at me 4 times!!!  MISSING food (had to drive all the way back for that one!), called and ordered and was told order would be ready in 10 mins, ended up waiting close to half an hour - dude didn't put my order in until I got there!!!! WTF???!! it just sucks because I really want to like this place, and have given it so many chances but it's mainly because this guy screws everything up (it's ALWAYS the same guy that screws things up) that I choose to no longer dine there...dude doesn't even say thank you..and I considered myself one of their regulars! There's just so many other Pho places in town that offer better service, without all the mistakes.   Food is pretty decent, like I said, but is negated by the fact that service sucks so bad (when it isn't the owner), that you lose focus on what your eating and end up thinking about how shitty the service is.   Regardless of of how good the food is, when the last memory of your dining experience is how bad the service is, it's pretty pointless. I come to expect that crap at fast food joints like BK, and McD's, but not a place like this, especially considering there are TONS of Pho places in Vegas that offer comparable food with BETTER service.   Save yourself buyers remorse and look for better options. Service here is inconsistent  at best..and down right shitty at worst.  Note to Annie if you're reading this: I think you personally are quite nice, and enjoy your service, but this guy that works there, get rid of him...your business will slowly dry up because of people like this. If not fire him, don't let him serve customers...let him clean your toilets or mop floors or take out the trash...you don't want someone like that to represent your establishment, considering the service you provide personally is actually decent. Maybe if he's gone I would actually return!",

    "text": "This place has some good pho! The staff here aren't the most polite (you'd know what I mean if you have Asian aunties), but don't let that affect your visit! For example, the owner, Annie, was looking for fish sauce for another table that somehow did not have any. She happened to notice the full bottle on my table, so she reached over my food with no clear \"Excuse me\" or \"Thank you\" (same thing when she came to put it back). I thought it was funny, but I am familiar with this type of \"mannerism\" so it didn't bother me at all.  My favorite dish on the menu is the crabmeat and tomato pho with vermicelli. There are nicely-sized clumps of crabmeat (Fresh? Imitation? Who cares?), peeled shrimp, wedges of tomatoes, sausage slices, fried tofu, and beef liver, garnished with green onions and what I think is dried fish shavings or something. The broth is bright orange and not spicy at all. I always order this with some Thai Iced Tea. For each soup, they also bring out the usual side of bean sprouts, sliced peppers, basil leaves, limes, etc. I also like their egg rolls and spring rolls with peanut sauce (yummmm!!!). The food usually comes out very quickly, unless they are very busy... which sometimes they are.  The dining area is long and quite limited in seating. There are booths along one side of the wall, with a few tables near the front. The interior is nice and dimly lit with a TV on either end of the room.  Overall, I'd rate this 5 stars based on their menu and location. If you can look past their \"mannerisms\" you'll really enjoy it here!",

I was appalled and really disgusted by that. I really wanted to confront her and I should have.

We had shrimp egg rolls, potstickers, chicken noodle pho, and the pork chops.  Deliciousness!  Even the kids thought everything was fantastic.  My cup of water never went dry.  Service was excellent.    Next time I want to try the roast duck pho and the rare beef pho.  :)   Thanks!!!",

Nothing too extensive but they make everything very well and the food comes out fresh and fast. Noticed that they don't have combinations of meat for their pho but you can always ask them to add things for you.   I like that they aren't stingy with the lime and jalapenos and the portions are filling. Also they have these round spoons that are amaaazing for creating the perfect noodle to soup ratio per bite!",

I decided to order the Pho Tai Nam (Noodle with Rare Steak and Flank) which is usually what I'll order to make fair comparisons between pho restaurants.   The pho was pretty good, but it didn't blow me away. The flank was VERY fatty, so if you're into that, maybe Pho Aimie is for you. Besides that, everything else was about what you'd expect from an average bowl of pho.   If you like fattier meat with your pho, or you don't want to drive far for your Vietnamese fix, Pho Aimie might sound enticing. However, if you're willing to drive an additional five minutes north on Rainbow, Pho Saigon 8 is far superior. But, that's just my opinion, visit both and see for yourself!",

    "text": "I've been coming here for years since it was since Pho Rainbow. Pho Rainbow was amazing. Extra rare beef and meat, a big plate of bean sprouts, yummy broth that tasted like it was actually stewing in bone marrow. And the biggest plus was that it was 10 miles closer than driving to Chinatown for pho.  Sadly, this isn't the case anymore since staff and management changed for Pho Annie   Since it changed, food quality can't compare: **Broth seems like it's from the pho broth powder. Not as much meat. Small oval platter of sprouts and mint leaves. Not bad. Just mediocre. It doesn't stand out compared to Chinatown. **Pan fried noodles aren't really Hong Kong style if that's what you want. They use a thicker canton type noodle (instead of thin egg noodles) thats drenched in brown sauce. It's literally a deep dish of noodles with soup filled halfway. Fish taste fishy. (We all know then that it wasn't fresh fish I was eating)  **DEALBREAKER: In the summer, I had Che Ba Mau (3 bean Dessert) that I noticed something was off. My groupmates seemed to brush off my , \"does yours taste different to you?\" notion while we were there. I finished it halfway before going to discard it but my boyfriend took a bite and gave me the weirdest look....the coconut milk in my dessert was SPOILED. It was sweet but had a sour taste that I took in for \"normal\" because of restaurant variation.He even gave it to his whole family to try to which they all looked at me in awe cos I actually continued to eat it.  I was so embarrassed.  OVERALL: It's not the worst pho place, I'm sure. It's just that I keep returning hoping it would return back to its glory days. But they seem to let me down. This place is okay for a craving fix, but if you have the time and gas, I'd rather go the extra distance for Chinatown quality.",

The food, - quality is 4/5, the food is really good, the quality of pho is on par with any other good pho place. -My favorite to get is tofu pho with fresh tofu. -Also the spring rolls, they are alright, I wish they came with the cold noodles like other places do.  The service, -customer service 5/5 is great here, it's always busy yet they are very attentive of the customers and their needs. -I order the tofu pho without veggies and fresh tofu and they always make it happen and never complain or make a big fuz about it.  The price, - 4/5 overall not bad but not good. -I have eaten very quality food with bigger portions for cheaper but the distance makes up for that.  The ugly  - not much at all. - thai tea size is small, completely full of ice and very expensive.  Overall great place in the southwest, worth a try -",

I took my parents here, they wanting to eat pho, and I hearing from my friends that the Annie Pho near our neighborhood was highly recommended.   In my opinion, this Annie Pho has literally the worst workers I've ever met in my life. I've never met a worker who just completely ignores my family while we patiently wait to order. He sticks his pointer finger at us, and rudely says to \"Wait.\" When we finally get to order, he rushes and cuts us off on our order.  Then, when my mother asks a simple question (can I have more water), he literally just walks past us without batting an eye.   When we finish eating, we have to grab the takeout boxes on the other side of the restaurant ourselves and wait over 10 minutes before being given the bill.   Of course, there was no tip, and I most certainly will NEVER come back.   There's other Pho places out there in the city.",

They advertised a specialty of theirs the Mi Hai San..Dry egg noodle with seafood with a special sauce which came with a bowl of soup....nasty...like eating a big bowl of salt, the sauce was basically oyster sauce watered down.  The mackerel appetizer was decent.  The appetizers came after the specialty noodle with no soup...the soup arrived about 15 minutes later.  Along with my wonton noodle.  It wasn't that packed but the waiter seemed as if he was rushing back and forth.  And oh....and the condiments...oh the condiments....you literally had to pry the them off the counter surface they were so sticky...and the spoon in the chili container was all black, gooed at the tip where the chili and air meet.

This is the only pho place that can satisfy my truly giant appetite! And it's not overpriced for these giant portion sizes either!  For pho aficionados, you know the first thing you ever do when you're served a bowl of pho is to taste just the broth itself. Proper pho broth requires it to be simmered for 6+ hours and is usually the star of the show. I can definitely taste the love and care they put into their broth. The broth is clean tasting and perfectly compliments the pho noodles. I usually get the combination bowl so I can enjoy all the traditional cuts of meat you put on top of pho.  Service is always top notch and has always been super speedy. Our party has never had to wait long during the numerous times we've come.  When the weekend comes and I'm in the mood for pho, you better believe this is the only place I'll go to get my pho fix.",

I couldn't add anymore jalapenos, sriracha, hosain sauce or onions to even help just a little.

They are also willing to work with a gluten Intolerance and will remove ingredients that they use in dishes that would make them off limits. The lemon grass stir fry bun (,vermicelli rice noodle nowl) was very good. I have also had their curry chicken, which I found less oily than other Vietnamese restaurants, as well as their veggie pho. Both were quite good. I recommend checking this spot out. It is well known for its beef pho, but they have many other delicious options available as well!",

I have also tried other dishes here like the spring rolls and fried noodles, they are decent but not as good as the soup dishes. The prices are competitive with other pho places in the area so it comes down to what taste best to you. This is my daughter's favorite so you know how that goes! Actually, I do like the food here especially the wonton soup- nice on a cold Vegas day.  The service here is quick and friendly. The restaurant itself is updated and clean. Pho Aimie is a good local pho place, serving delicious hot soup and traditional Vietnamese dishes at great prices. Bon Appetit!",

The pho is pretty good. It isn't mind blowing, but it is good authentic pho. I think their soup is key to their pho. They also give a lot of meat which is a huge bonus! Their fresh egg rolls were really good too! A little small though because each roll is half the size of a full one. I'd come here again because of the convenience and good pho.",

Conveniently located on Rainbow Blvd right next to Sparklings bar & restaurant, and The Lodge bar, this is a heck of a noodle place.   You can dine or carry out, and be advised they do not have a liquor license so no wine/beer etc. and no BYO. They do have Coca Cola, water and other canned and bottled soft drinks.   Their menu is huge, there is something for just about every diet. Three of my friends and I dined here a few days ago and it was fantastic. We started with some of the rice paper rolls which had shrimp and were raw (not deep fried). They came with a dark brown cold peanut sauce which was amazing. My other two friends ordered pot stickers which they said were very good.   For entrees, my buddy had the Beef Brisket Pho and I had the shrimp with stir fried noodles. My friend said it was delicious, and the serving was a very generous bowl with chopsticks utensils. I don't really care for soupy dishes so the shrimp with stir friend noodles was perfect for me. Way too much for me but I took half of it home. This place has a very warm, comforting atmosphere and friendly staff. The prices are very reasonable, overall a great dinner for us.",

Of all the times Ive been here, it's always busy. This is my first time doing take out so I was able to observe. For a Monday night, it was exceptionally busy! The owner kept apologizing to everyone for how busy they were and  falling behind. I, myself waited almost an hour for my take out but that's okay. I totally understand! It's not like they were sitting around picking their ass. They were Hustling!   If you want good egg rolls and pho, definitely go to this place!

We found this place on yelp and drove 5 mins from Windmill to get here.   We were seated immediately and looked through the menu for abt 5mins. I ordered the P.16 (Well done Brisket and Flank Noodle soup) and my friend ordered the P.22 (Chicken Meat Noodle Soup in beef broth), with pork and taro vietnamese fried egg rolls to share. The portions are large and delicious. My friend has soup to take home and we devoured the egg rolls. Portions are huge for the price of less than $10 for soup. Service was great and they only brought the tab when they'd made sure I was completely done eating. Not into hot soup? They have rice and noodles without the soup as well as appetizers and the options to add spice to any of it. The only fault I found was that my cup of water was dirty and I'd only realized it at the end of my meal (having had 2-3 \"top off\" refills). That kinda grossed me out. All in all though...3 stars. Considering returning.",

The pho broth is perfectly balanced with just the right amount of flavor to either eat as it is or customized.  The egg rolls were fresh, crunchy and incredibly delicious.  While some egg rolls tend to be single note, this one managed to be complex with texture and different discernible flavors.  The Thai iced tea wasn't syrupy or overly heavy, but achieved a perfect balance of creaminess and depth.  As somebody who considers themselves a discerning pho consumer, this has passed every taste test with flying colors.    In addition to the phenomenal flavors, the service is quick, polite and attentive and the interior of the restaurant is understated but cozy.    This may have to be my new spot and I'm glad to have found it.",

That best describes my Pho Aimie experience.   I was introduced to their spicy chicken curry pho a few years ago and fell head over heels for the dish. So when I was planning my eats for my quick trip to Vegas, Pho Aimie made the cut.   Mom and I went there on a Sunday afternoon and she ordered the same dish but with rice and I ordered it pho style. I was highly disappointed as the dish did not bring back any nostalgia feels and I was left puzzled wondering what I loved about this dish back in the day.   The broth lacked that rich consoling flavor which was either from no seasoning or too much oil. Not the most disgusting thing I've had, but it was not even close to a-ok. It also had way too many onions and that just added to the treachery.  The service was better than the food but that's usually at every pho place. They're pretty attentive and get your food out quick.   Sorry not sorry but next visit to Vegas, Pho Aimee is not on the list.",

Normally, I'd drive down to spring MTN to eat good Vietnamese foods, however, there's one so close by my house. I ate a few times here and I loved every single dish they have. I go here regularly now because the  foods are great and the people are nice and sweet especially Annie, the owner. Please try it yourself and you'll love it!!! Overall, this place deserves 5 stars from me....keep up the great foods!!!",

    "text": "Well I just love eating Pho, so instead of always heading to Chinatown for Pho I decided to give this neighborhood Pho place a try. I walked in and everyone was very friendly, I indeed felt welcomed which is always nice when going into any restaurant let alone a neighborhood spot. Sat down got our orders and everything seemed ok until once the food came the service stopped. My friend and no water for the longest time, plus I kept piling dishes that were dirty and no longer needed in the front of the table hoping the next person that walk by would pick them up but they stayed on the table the entire time. My friend had to call for someone to bring her water. And I had to ask someone to please clear the dirty plates that were sitting on the table. Maybe their policy is get them in, get them fed and get them outside with no service in between. It's a shame too because I liked how friendly they were and the food was good. The potstickers were really good. I gave 2 stars due to how friendly they were and the potstickers were good. This place has potential if the service was better. Without good service it makes going out to eat meaningless.",

I order their Annie pho special (it was just OK) nothing special about it. They gave a side of sprouts and 1 sprig of basil with 4 edible leaves on it the rest were totally brown and discolored. But the whole reason for the review is because I also order there Butter fried chicken wings... my nephew ate the first wing and I had another ... I took my first bite and noticed BLOOD was still present and if you gave it a little squeeze more blood would seep out (pictured) I looked over at my nephews piece and it was completely red inside and by then it was too late he had already consumed the whole wing. I was planning on calling and reporting this but there is no sense of doing so because they guy who answers the phone can barely speak English ... I hope you all learn something from this and will be more cautious when eating here. NEVeR AGAIN!!!!",

I love Pho and I don't have a super refined palette but the broth here is far too sweet to make this place recommendable (for me at least). You can really taste the sugar in the broth and no matter how much Siracha or other sauces I added to my Pho Dac Biet, I couldn't get rid of the sweet.   The service however is fast and the staff there is pretty pleasant. I just honestly wouldn't go there to eat any of the Pho... which honestly then makes it a moot point for me. Why would I go to a place that has \"Pho\" in the title and not eat the Pho? Hard pass on this place.",

The quality of the food, portion size and price are well worth the value and visit. The restaurant is very friendly as the owner is very hands off and provides great service along with her staff.   --------------------------------------------Food - 5/5--------------------------------------------------- The food is very consistent and well prepared and made. The menu is well designed and covers most of the essential Vietnamese dishes. A few of my favorites include;  Pho Tai / Pho Tai Sach - Traditional beef pho (I prefer mine with tripe). The broth is very well seasoned and packs a ton of flavor. According to Ann, they do not use MSG. Hard to say that about other Vietnamese places.  Bun Thit Nuong Cha Gio- The rice vermacilli noodles with grilled pork and egg rolls is another one of my favorites. This is one of my to-go dish because its quick and simple to grab on my way home. Plus the portion size is quite big and I can easily get fulfilled.  Rice with Pork chop and baked egg- Another one of my favorite dishes to get at the restaurant or to-go. This comes with 2 large porkchop, baked egg, lettuce, tomatoes, and picked radishes. Very fullfilling meal and the portion sizes can be quite filling for one person.  ----------------------------------------------Service 5/5------------------------------------------------- Services is the best thing about this place. Ann is very hands on with her business and is very professional and courteous to every customer. She treats everyone like friends and family which is my favorite type of service. It is very genuine and makes it my favorite pho location in town not just because I believe it has one of the better Pho but the service is one of the best. --------------------------------------------Cleanliness - 5/5--------------------------------------------- Front of house is clean and the open kitchen looks well maintained as well. One of the harder parts in a restaurant is a visible kitchen and Pho Annie has no problem allowing the customers to see the kitchen.  Overall, one of my favorite Pho locations in town. Great food, affordable price and great services makes a great experience. Very good locations to go for lunch, dinner or for grabbing a to-go order.",

The rice was soggy, the cha was mushy and had no taste and it was oddly colored.. The xuon was alright but not good. They went cheap on the fish sauce too. It used to be given in a big cup but now the size shrunk so I end up eating plain and soggy rice. Before they'd give 2 pieces of xuon, cha was outstanding, and even a side of eggs. Don't even get me started on the soup that goes with the order. It was sour I don't know if it was because all of the onions that was in it or the broth is old. Never coming back again.",

I hung up the phone after that and tried to call back, but then the line was busy. Just wow.   As for the food, it's not bad. Good flavor, everything is seasoned well and cooked to order. Freshly washed veggies, piping hot broths and tender cuts of meat help to maintain a 3-star rating in my opinion.

She had ordered a rare beef & tendon pho (#18?) and i ordered the combination pho (#12?)  Combination pho - $7.99? - various types of sliced beef, two slivers of beef balls (yeah slivers.. imagine a beef ball... and cut into.... 1/8th's...), and a piece of tendon. Meat and noodle amount wasn't bad. To me, seemed a LITTLE more than the usual from like Pho Saigon 8 or Pho So 1, but those two definitely didn't have meat balls in their combination pho's. The broth, not exactly msg free. Reason i say that is, if it was a real made broth, you usually dont feel like you have phlegm in your throat, causing you to do the *eh-hem* kind things to \"clear\" it. Wasn't a soup i'd drink completely like some other places.   Rare beef & Tendon Pho - $6.99? - this wasn't my order but from what my friend said, she didn't get that many pieces of tendon (disappointing for her since she loves eating tendon). And to her, it didn't seem like much of a size difference compared to other places.   NOTE - minimum credit card charge is $10.   Overall, not a bad place, if you are in the area. I'd probably pick this place over the other place down the street (Jenni Pho)",

I told the waitress (who I'm pretty sure was Annie herself) that I like the broth of bun bo hue but not all that crap in it. She quickly suggested the special, Pho Sate, and oh man .. it was life changing! A delicious spicy and sour beef broth with pho noodles and flank. All these years of sirracha drenched pho .. only wish I knew about it sooner.    The spot is nice a clean, and the staff is usually friendly and attentive. I've tried their appetizers and rice plates as well. Good food all around!",

Three of us ordered Pho-Seafood Pho, Special Pho with duck and beef, etc., and I ordered Chicken Curry Pho, which really wasn't all that spicy. I didn't particularly like the chicken part, felt it was a little too tough, but the broth part and noodle part of my pho were good. Also ordered Vietnamese Iced Coffee, which was excellent.   My fave parts were the spring rolls and the iced coffee. Would also recommend seafood pho and pad Thai based on its looks and its lovely scents. Cute Asian inspired decor throughout, such as the lucky cat, bamboo......Service was prompt and friendly.",

They post on yelp that business hour is till 10 pm then normally people think that it should be ok to go there before 10pm. I will try to understand if restaurant was empty but it was pretty full and he only offer togo So I felt that he didn't want to work...  I wonder if owner aware on this kind of situation  So my suggestion is post on yelp that close at 9:30pm instead of 10 pm.  Anyways I usually prefer to go pho annie over Jenni pho even though jenni pho is much closer from my place but I guess not anymore... I want them to know one small little thing and one employee can ruin whole restaurants reputation.",

I called ahead and the guy on the phone was nice enough and got my order on the first try, which is rare for phone orders with the language barrier. LOL. He said it would be ready in 5 minutes and luckily I was just 5 minutes away. They were a bit skimpy on the meat and tendon, but DAMN that is one good bowl of pho. I ALWAYS have to drench my broth in fish sauce, but I didn't have any on hand and realized I had forgotten to ask for a side. But thankfully the broth was perfect just the way it came, and I only needed to add some sriracha. I daresay this is the best bowl of pho I've ever had. I will be coming back to dine in and check out this horrible service I keep hearing about...Hopefully it's just a myth from some picky yelpers. ;) oh yeah, and other food items!",

First thing I noticed was that all the customers were regulars (good sign!). This lady (assuming is Annie), went around and chatted with all the customers like they were family. +1 to service. I ordered the pho dac biet and the bf ordered the beef noodle soup. I really enjoyed the broth for mine but as Andrew C. mentioned, it was probably laced with msg. My inner Chinese could just tell but thankfully I'm used to msg. The amount of noodle was good however it was lacking in some of the meat and tripe. I really like tripe =( and there was literally 1 beef ball... it was cut in half. Not a very tasty beef ball might I add. We also ordered a side of fried egg rolls. They were fried well however I didn't like the filling.. the bf however loved it. So if you're ever in the area and want pho or if you're just deciding between Jennipho or Pho Annie, ALWAYS PICK PHO ANNIE.",

    "text": "Definitely coming back.   Phantasy hair salon recommended this spot and I have to say. It's pretty good.   Being from LA, around the SGV we are surround by the best pho in the the world!!! So whenever I travel to other cities, states, country-- I try their pho. I have to say Pho Annie lives up to SGV standards and is definitely the best pho in Vegas IMO. Plus I don't have to deal with going to Vegas Chinatown.   Definitely try Pho Annie's special pho and ask for the spicy broth (if you like spice). And you can't go wrong with the mango salad (effin good!) and the egg wrapped fried rice!   The place is small but very clean and the service is VERY FRIENDLY! Absolutely better service than the pho spots in LA. lol",

I always get take out pho here, ordering on the phone ahead of time, usually takes them 10-15 minutes.  I never had to wait a long time for my order.  The people that work here know what they're doing!  Whenever I do eat inside, whenever I want more broth they always give me more with no problem or charge.  I love it.  Sometimes at other pho restaurants the broth is kind of oily which makes my stomach churb, but Pho Annie's pho isn't like that, it is always on point! I would go to this pho restaurant before going all the way to Chinatown for pho.  It's just as good, probably even better than most pho places on Spring Mountain.",

We got seated, and ordered two waters and one hot tea. We received one water and one hot tea. When the waiter came to take our order, I once again asked for another water. When they came to deliver the dipping sauces for the egg rolls, which was about five minutes later, I once again asked for another water. When they delivered our egg rolls, about ten minutes later - I once again asked for another water. When they delivered our main course, about a minute and a half later - I once again asked for a water. FIVE TIMES. Five times of asking to get a simple glass of water. Seriously? That's so ridiculous.   Also, the fact that our appetizer came out only a minute and a half before our entree, is ridiculous to me. That's not quite the point of an appetizer - but ok. They were decent in taste. The pho was alright. Broth was very oily and not too hot. Flavor was there though.   All in all, no thanks Pho Annie. No thanks.",

    "text": "I am definitely a fan!   Pho Annie is located literally right next to Cheeburger Cheeburger off of Rainbow Blvd just south of Windmill Drive.   The place is pretty small and a bit older, but was still almost totally filled with diners when we arrived earlier this afternoon. At first, we were a bit taken back because one of the first things we saw upon entering was a server \"aggressively\" bussing a table. We just looked at each other like \"ok\", this could be interesting.  Actually, this ended up being a great experience! My friend was craving some pho and ordered the #10, the Annie Special ($9.95), which included beef, meatballs, tripe, and plenty of noodles. He commented that this pho was much better than the pho we had at Jenni pho just a few days ago. Looks like with the cooler weather here, I will be grabbing a bowl of pho here on my next visit!  As for me, I opted for the #40 ($9.95). This consisted of a tender, marinated pork chop that was unbelievably tasty! On the side was a small \"salad\", a healthy portion of jasmine rice with a fried egg on top, and some cucumber slices. Great choice for my first visit here!  The service was actually solid here as well. The server was quick to top off our beverages without a word and checked in on us a couple of times to see how things were going, but not to the point of being intrusive.  I was greatly impressed and, since it is a stones throw from my new house, I will be back to try more and more menu items! I can easily see this becoming a regular spot!  4 solid stars!",

He kind of just put our table together when we got there and ran to the back. Then the next guest that comes through the door and they receive the correct service from the younger server. Going to so many Asian restaurants, I should be used to this, but the difference between the two bothered me. Why is there never consistency?   However, all that changed once the younger server ended up taking care of us. I ordered the standard pho because they ran out of the chicken curry pho. We also ordered the duck pho and the fried eggrolls, both great. The only reason I will come back is for the service and to try that chicken curry pho finally. I also like how they take credit cards unlike Jenny Pho. It's just nice that I don't have to travel all the way to Chinatown for pho anymore.",

Service was great, always refilled our waters and were very attentive, but for whatever reason, the pho was very lackluster. I drowned my soup in soy sauce and hoisen to try to get some kind of flavor, and it did nothing. The \"vegetables\" in my vegetable pho consisted of 95% broccoli, 2 pieces of bok choy, 1 carrot slice, 2 slices of tofu, and although I requested extra onion, barely any onion. The broth was downright gross for both of us. (I had vegetable broth, he had beef broth)  Whomever the new owners are, you need to step up your game. A lot. We are currently looking for a new pho spot. Likely won't return.",

Free from any remains of food or gunk stuck like how other Asian/pho places in Chinatown.  Boyfriend and I always order the spring rolls to start off with. I order the Pho Tai (rare beef steak) and he orders the Well Done Flank. Each bowl was about $7.95. Pretty good sized portion too. Our orders always come super quick....like within 3 minutes!!! Even quicker during early dinner time. Wow! I'm loving that!  The one thing that stands out with Pho Annie versus other pho places I've tried is their broth contains no MSG. It's not as salty. Broth is still fantastic and drenching it in Sirracha sauce is even better!!!!! Yumm!!! This is PERFECT on a cold, winters day!!  We met the owner too, Annie. Such a sweet lady. Very friendly and personable. Even though it was super busy that day, she still stopped by and had a chat with us.",

During the early days, my best friend and I would get pissed off waiting on food, but then when it finally came (I typically got pho dac biet and she got the pork and egg roll bun), the food would be so amazing and we'd be like, \"Well the wait was totally worth it!\"  Fast forward a few years of amazing food, and friendly service (we love Annie btw... such a nice and hard-working owner)... we had a friend come from Santa Monica, CA with their 3 year old daughter. They were staying at our place and we decided to go out for a celebratory dinner. I had my usual, pho dac biet, and everyone got egg rolls and chicken fried rice.  Something was wrong with the fried rice because when we got home, everyone except me threw up. I was so sad, because #1 I love Annie, #2 this place was my go-to place for family and friend events. I had to post this because I want people to be safe and I want Pho Annie to get better, back to where it was when I came to eat at least twice a week. I heard ownership changed, so please make it as good as it was before, with fresh meat, bouncy noodles, and sophisticated light broth.  I want to come back and give this place more stars.",

Then after 10-15 mins another guy asks us if we're waiting, and we tell him the same. He says wait another 10-15 mins. Too much confusion and no communication. Finally, we're seated separately (as their restaurant doesn't accommodate parties this big). Then after waiting quite long for someone to take our order, we notice one of the guys taking orders from another table that arrived WAY after us, and then he still never came to us. I've ordered beef stew from here to go previously, which was pretty good. But this experience was poor as f***!   Updated 1/15/17 I should've mentioned it actually wasn't that busy on this specific evening, and I've gone to many restaurants with the expectation to wait (of course with a bigger party especially), however, I did state we noticed other tables having their orders taken BEFORE us, after they arrived and were even seated AFTER us. I personally don't think there is any excuse for that.",

But it is hands down my favorite local Vietnamese joint. The thing I love must about this place is it's 'mom and pop' vibe. You can tell it's just a small family owned business the minute you walk into the restaurant.   1) Service: the waiter is super attentive. They come every few minutes to refill our water. The manager checked on us every time we were there to make sure we were satisfied with our meal. The service is extremely fast and efficient but they also take the time to smile and exchange pleasantries.   2) Food: the real deal!! 3 things you must order there: (1) BBQ pork chop rice with egg (2) BBQ pork vermicelli with egg roll (3) the beef noddle soup. The best thing about this place is they don't over salt their food. Their noodle soup is perfect- flavorful but not drenched in MSG. The BBQ pork is grilled to perfection. It's my husband's favorite item on the menu. He can't get enough! We haven't tried their pho, but it's on our to do list!   3) Atmosphere: on the outside, it looks like a lodge so it's easy to mistaken it for a bar. On the inside, its a small little restaurant  with some big flavors! The place is clean and well renovated.   4) Quality: delicious food, large portions, and cheap prices. What more can you ask for?? Most plates range from $8-12.   Definitely my favorite Vietnamese place! Trust me, you'll love it. Best local hot spot in the southwest.",

I'd love to keep this place a secret, but they've built up quite a regular crowd and this place can get super busy with tables and to-go orders on any given night - it's worth the wait!

The biggest thing that threw me off is how oily it is! It has that oily aftertaste and it was just different. We didn't like it at all but the meat was good and it was just overall \"ok\".

So this review isn't the most informative in terms of the taste of the pho. I ordered the Special Annie Pho. It was tasty, as is the pho at most places. The portion size was solid for the price.  I will say the service was excellent. It was a packed house on a Friday night and the food came out quickly. I went here with my aunt, uncle and cousin from out of town and they wanted to take typical Filipino family vacation group photos with their food. It would've been easy for the servers to shrug us off because it's a packed house, but they were accommodating and took some pictures for us on my cousin's iPad.  Another superficial perk is that they have a TV on the back wall playing the ESPN NBA game of the night. While they could've been playing some Vietnamese movie or blasting Vietnamese pop music (both of which do me no good), they instead play my favorite sport. Steph Curry from way downtown.... BANG!!",

The CCNS consists of a thick, rich, hearty broth that touches my soul like Louis Armstrong singing \"What a Wonderful World\".  It's easy to taste upon the first spoonful of this glorious curryness that it's not something that can just be whipped up.  Those chickens have been simmering in broth for hours, if not days.  The generous amount of meat in the bowl makes me love it even more.    Not that there's anything wrong with their rare beef pho or those meat entrees where the grains of rice looks all cute and snuggled up under the canopy of a perfectly fried egg, but that's all vice president/runner up type stuff.  Next time I order, I plan on just saying \"Call me Obama and bring me that fucking awesome stuff in a bowl.\"",

Pretty much my go-to when having a pho craving.",

I have a toddler and an infant- instead of giving me nasty looks the server and manager were ultra attentive. When my toddler started acting up, they gave her things to keep her occupied. Let's talk about the food-AMAZING! I ordered two vermicelli dishes that my parents and I shared: Singapore noodles and a crunchy one. Both were beyond amazing. Fried rice was fresh and tasty as were the veggie spring rolls. I can't wait to come back.",

The establishment is very small so if you're heading in during lunch/dinner rush hour, be prepared to stand by the doorway for awhile. The staff is very attentive though but with such a limited space, you feel like you're being rushed as other patrons will be staring at you just waiting for you and your guest to leave.  But as far as food goes, Pho is Pho ;) The meat is very tasty and pretty fresh. It's awesome to see the kitchen too.",

By the time the spring rolls came out, we were already getting full. For dinner, I ordered a grilled pork rice plate, which is supposed to come with a side of broth, but they forgot the broth too! At least the pork was  tender and flavorful. I also ordered chicken curry noodle soup for another entree. It was good, except too thick and more curry than soup like. I also ordered hot tea, which was oddly served in plastic cups instead of a a traditional tea kettle and tea cups. Besides all the mishaps, the prices are decent and it beats driving all the way to Chinatown to eat Vietnamese food.",

I ordered the Seafood Pho and it came in a fairly quick time. I ate it all but it didn't blow me away. The broth seemed fairly boring and not terribly flavorful but then again not bad.

The Pho is decent here, but the star is the Bun Bo Hue (spicy noodle soup).  Better than most others I have sampled in Vegas, the rice plates are good too.  The service for me has been fine, as I get waited on by Annie herself alot, I haven't seen that \"other\" guy.... but then again I'm used to the \"service\" from the asian joints so I am a bit more forgiving.... So in a pinch, this spot works for me, but give the Bun Bo Hue a try...and don't let the pork blood squares or the pig's feet pieces scare you, just try it.....there's worst and scarier things you could eat......

I like that it's not super busy and no wait to sit, the bathrooms are nice, and the food came very quickly. The pho is very good, maybe even better than pho Kim long. And my server was very attentive, which I am not used to when going to eat pho. I definitely will be back :)",

    "text": "Four words - chicken curry noodle soup!  A nice coconut-based yellow curry with bone-in chicken and noodles.  There is just enough of a light spice to burn a little but make you want more.  My wife had the shrimp mango salad - lots of shredded mango, dressed with some sort of fish-sauce based liquid, topped with shrimp.  Very good!  My son had the rare beef and meatball pho - he demolished it!  This place was less than a mile from our vacation rental and was a real find.  Lots of parking, but a little hard to find.  In the same parking area as Sparklings and the Lodge.",

    "text": "I love their Mango Salad, its my favorite on the menu.  Its green mango julienned into pieces, topped with lots of shrimp and flavored with fish sauce.  I like to add in some Siracha to give it a little kick, yuuumm!    I got to try something else other than their pho.  By the way, their portions are enormous.  Every time I've ordered, I can only finish half the bowl.  So this time around, I tried the duck noodle soup.  I thought the duck was going to be the itty bitty pieces of duck, but these were large portions.  I'm talking fat pieces of meat on every bite.  It is served with clear noodles, the thick rice vermicelli.  I think next time I will ask for egg noodle or pho noodles because those noodles are hard to eat.  They get stuck together and when you take a big bite and try to bite it off, that wasn't really working for me so I just had to slurp up whatever I scooped up.  LOL.    Service is great here, they are actually pretty quick everytime we come here.  I definitely recommend this place.  They also take Credit Cards, unlike the restaurant down the way when you have no cash.",

I asked for napkins, she said okay but never returned with those either. Was not friendly and when refilling water would overfill so that ice and water spilled and didn't say a word about it.
