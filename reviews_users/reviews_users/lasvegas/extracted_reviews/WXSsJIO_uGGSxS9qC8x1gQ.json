    "text": "It's January.  This year you've decided to lose everything you put on the last 15 years (good luck).  So you show up here, your trainer recommended it, or you overheard some bros talking about it in the squat rack, or you just saw it leaving LVAC.  And its with good reason.  Its 1. in the same parking lot as LVAC, 2. they use minimal oil to reduce calories, and 3. protein is in the name so you know you'll be feeding those muscles for some sick gains bro.   Ok enough being silly.  This is a great healthy restaurant that puts greens and proteins (its healthy option, in the same shopping center competitor) to shame.  I got the turkey bowl, a delicious, surprisingly moist, turkey patty with black beans and and veggies over brown rice.  I think they must have made a deal with the devil because I can never get brown rice to rase good or turkey to be anything but a hockey puck (wait am I just a bad cook?....) It also came with avocado and a side of salsa.  Ahhh-maaaaa-zingggg! And huge too! I didn't get the calorie count but they guy said he could give me an idea of the macros on any of the items when i was trying to make my mind up (- a star because that info should totally be on the menu!)  Which reminds me, the menu is HUGE!! I didn't know so many healthy options existed!  My husband got the southwest chicken griller, A grilled chicken breast, lettuce, beans, avocado and cheese wrapped in a tortilla (whole wheat of course!) and grilled.  It was also delicious!  The restaurant was very clean, they had some mellow chill electronic music and a big screen with a muted metallica concert on (thanks for the mute haha)  All in all, this is a great place to grab a post workout bite, or just a normal I'm hungry kinda bite!",

We returned after watching a movie and tried their BigBoy Bison burger with egg whites and a side of sweet potato mash. My husband and I throughly enjoyed it. We also polished off one of their 3-packs of peanut butter balls. My husband is not a fan of peanut butter but he enjoyed it.  They provide great healthy alternatives and serve breakfast all day! Will definitely be back to try one of their juices and/or shakes!",

It was supposed to have mushrooms and eggplant sauteed with garlic layered over hummus. The problem was there was no eggplant in my dish. When I questioned someone about this he basically told me he didn't know where the eggplant was and this is the way they always make it. When I asked if the menu was wrong he said, 'I guess' and said he would talk to his boss (this was after trying to tell me the hummus was the eggplant). I'm not sure if the employees are uninformed or if the management didn't care, but no one else came out to talk to me about this issue. The food was good enough that we will probably give this place a second chance, but next time I will definitely question how my dish is prepared beforehand.",

Fabulous.   this morning after the gym we looked at each other and decided to come back.  we both got the ahi tuna bowls.  their fresh juices and protei. shkes are awsomw as well.  try thier protein peant butter protien balls, they were grest.  this place is very reasonable given the foods $8 to $13 per meal, but a great value.",

However tonight I decided to have a delivery because I was not feeling good and so the delivery comes. There is not the all the food I ordered in the bags. So I look over my emails and call the number in the email. It goes to the restaurant and then they tell me that the order is done through a third party and that I have to call the third party for the missing food. They are the ones that prepare the food and didn't put it in the bags that were picked up by the driver. Why do I need to call the third party?!?!?! Then I inform them that the only number in the email is their restaurant number. They tell me to google the number for the third party! Keep in mind the only thing I know about this third party is that it's a woman in a pink shirt who came to my flat to ring the doorbell. The rest I don't know. I don't have an email about this third party and the App I ordered from is called \"The Protein Source\"!!!! How is that NOT THEIR APP?!?!    Then the guy on the phone calls me \"hey Lady\" what kind of customer service when I am a paying customer who has not received what she has paid for in the first place. He then tries to give me the logistics of ins and out of their contract with the third party?!! How is that helpful! Just keep passing the buck and NEVER TAKE RESPONSIBILITY! What a ridiculous service! I am shocked at how I have been treated by this person! I really am saddened by this experience because I actually liked going there. You have now lost a customer.",

We were hungry,did not wish to return food and wait as we had work to do. Guys a little more consistency would be magic. Overall it's turned around so much since our 1st visit(now 7th).

They serve breakfast, bowls, salads, chili, wraps, burgers and drinks, juice, protein shakes and also have a kids menu. Each item was pictured and described in great detail.   There was one customer eating when we came in and five employees at the counter. Music was playing that was exceptionally loud. Since we had seen the menu before hand, we knew what we wanted to order. The employee who took our order asked if we wanted water while we waited and gave us 2 cups. I thought that was nice. Our order was ready about 10 minutes later.   We ordered the BBQ chicken stacks which were $9.49 for four.  The menu description was fresh cucumber shots toppped with chilled and chopped chicken breast, black bean salsa and Stevia barbecue sauce. There was more cucumber than chicken and barely any black bean salsa. The Stevia barbecue sauce was great.  We also ordered the skinny salmon bowl which was described as pan seared Atlantic salmon, asparagus and cherry tomatoes served over cauliflower mash topped with balsamic reduction and cilantro pesto $11.99. The cauliflower mash was runny and flavorless. Two halved cherry tomatoes had sunk in the cauliflower mash. The salmon  was also flavorless and had hard pieces of something in it. I'm not sure if it was bones but it was not edible.     Meager portions and awful, overpriced food. We will definitely not be returning here.",

I never was the type to get anything like that but was just talking to the owner (big Brazilian guy super friendly but can't remember his name) and was feeling in the dumps after a workout and he suggested it and made it himself and it was amazing. Super light and fluffy almost whipped consistency but also still solid and not whipped at the same time, and the perfect blend of sweet and natural no processed or artificial blends and nicely matched with the shredded coconut. I got it again since but the way he makes it is literally one of a kind I'd highly recommend asking him to make you one if the chance presents itself. Being a unhappy regular at greens and proteins I was happy when TPS opened and even had a small discussion with the owner about how I felt about greens and proteins and we got into a pretty long discussion about the difference between someone's idea of healthy and healthy, a meal you see as healthy and really giving your body nutrition and he really nailed it on the head. And that to me is the big difference between the two (also the fact that I spend $50 and leave hungry at G&P and I could spend the same at TPS and feel full for a few hours-for two people) Prices are very similar to other health food places but the portions and the flavors are really the big difference here $14 will get you a big bowl of veggies sweet potatoe mash and high quality elk or bison that you probably won't be able to finish without a massive appetite and $9 will get you a tasty wrap or breakfast plate. Speaking of, breakfast all day!  Another thing I like is the music, it's a massive flashback of fun and good electronic music.  And a huge thing for me is that this place DOES NOT have a soda machine. Instead you can fill your drinks will vitamin water ONE choice of coke zero or diet coke can't remember or powerade. Now that to me is big, how can you be eating at a \"health\" food restaurant that servers soda?  Protein source is very well connected with their customers and feedback and you can tell just by the menu.  Side note the low calorie low sugar sides and sauces served here are AMAZING the stevia bbq sauce is by far my favorite.  All in all 5 stars and everytime I come in I see more and more people becoming regulars. Way better than G&P more passion and flavor go into every dish and more of the actual food too.",

When we called, this nice woman picked it up, and handed over to manager, then this man answered the phone with foreign language over and over, even though we keep saying \"Hello?\", so they hung up, and we called them again, the woman handed over to manager again, and we hear the foreign language again, so we finally asked \"can you speak English?\", and finally he said \"Yes\", but when we were complaining about the bad customer service, he barely answers anything, as if he barely understood what we are trying to say, and he keeps saying \"you come to us we give you free food\", he even said \"Oh I will have to call other location and find out who is lying\", but we didn't want any free food, we want to get our point across about their bad customer service, and who in their right mind dare to question customer's complain that he needs to find out who is lying? wow, just wow, I finally ask him to put me back to the woman who answers the phone because I felt like she sounded more thoughtful and alert, but he just said \"sorry we busy you come to our location next time to complain\" and then click, hung up on us again, we didn't give up and call them back, thank God the nice woman picked up, and listened to all our complain, and said she will try to forward our word to the manager, I think maybe she should be the manager and fire the manager herself.

So that's the service, now the food! I built my own plate with salmon, mixed veggies, add avocado, and sweet potato hash. It was delicious! The salmon was the perfect amount, the veggies tasted a little oily but still good (not over cooked, still had the crunch) and the sweet potato hash was good as well, had good flavor. My boyfriend, who was upset at the wait time, said the wait was worth his bulk up buffalo wrap. And he finished his salad. My cousin got the protein waffles with strawberry banana and chocolate and it came with a side of turkey bacon for extra protein. She devoted the whole thing.   Now I wish I had one on my side of town :( very good alternative to greens and protein, and slightly cheaper :)",

Described as: \"Pan Seared Wild Caught Atlantic Salmon, Asparagus and Cherry Tomatoes Over Cauliflower Mash Topped w/Balsamic Reduction and Cilantro Pesto.\"  The pictures on the glossy menu look amazing. But that is where the number of good things I can say ends. The only barely edible part of the dish was the salmon, which was not the best quality, judging by taste. It should have read \"swimming\" in mashed cauliflower. Which would be okay if they had used ANY seasoning at all. It basically tasted like they boiled everything and dumped it in there. I didn't taste any cilantro or pesto. Just boiled paste and some balsamic. Sorry but yuck.   On service: Not \"unfriendly\" staff, but is that really what you aim for when you run a business?   I returned the dish minus the salmon after a minute and commented on how disappointing it was. \"Flavorless\" was the word I used. The girl I spoke to mentioned that they had a new cook and that she would talk to him. Not her fault obviously, but I don't think this dish was an \"oopsie.\" I feel like the owner/manager of this place is clearly not involved at all. I can't speak to the rest of the stuff they serve, but I really don't feel like giving them any more of my money to find out.",

Went with a turkey burger with a side of sweet potatoes. Granted, I can make the exact same thing at home for a lot less than $12 (after tax/15% gratuity) but sometimes, it's nice to have someone else cook for you.   The turkey burger was moist, the bun was soft and fresh. The sweet potatoes actually had a little char on them that would make a lot of people would say (they were burned) but I actually thought it added a nice touch to them.   It came with a little sauce blend that was tasty but I just used ketchup as that is what I prefer.   The guy behind me ordered this Protein waffle that had like egg and turkey in it. So it looked like a waffle burger. I didn't see it on the menu but I know what I'll be getting next time!   When looking for a really clean meal, this is a really good spot to go to.   I say give it a try!",

We tried the garden fresh turkey burger, California Cobb wrap and the chickadilla for our son. Everyone at the table was happy with their choice. We will most definitely be back. And soon...  The place is clean and trendy looking with indoor and outdoor seating. Open til 10pm every night which is pretty convenient. Friendly staff. The works",

I went with the steak lovers bowl and absolutely loved it! Packed with flavor, veggies, and I was full about halfway but kept going because it tasted so great. I took it to go and waited for about 10 mins, fast service for what I got. I understand these places use quality food which makes it more expensive, but it hurt a little to pay $15 for one meal  watch your wallet if you're trying to make this a habit! Other than that, I'll definitely come back!",

I will probably keep coming back for more of that. It had lots of flavor and all my favorite ingredients. I didn't even use any of the extra sauces it came with on the side. The balsamic that came in it was perfect.  The egg-asparagus salad, on the other hand, wasn't very good. I didn't like the taste of the pesto it came with at all. The steak was overcooked, the asparagus had a weird taste to it and I ordered the egg over hard, since I'd be eating it hours later at work and didn't want the egg yolk running all over the lettuce before I could eat it. They made the egg very runny (I'd say it was over easy) and so from the time I picked it up the yolk was all over the lettuce and at the bottom of the container and made it all look unappetizing when I pulled it out of the fridge later.",

Granted you know the healthy food diners will cost more but really? $9.99 for three multi-grain pancakes with only two strawberries sliced 10 ways to give appearance of more? Menu photo showed blueberries, strawberries, and bananas! After receiving my order that was obviously missing a great deal, I walked up to menu board on wall. In small print description I read only strawberries mentioned. After tax and tip we're talking $13 for three multi-grain hot cakes with two strawberries? And yes, I tip knowing it isn't employees fault the owners boards are misleading.  Felt scammed and never going back.",

It's a little pricey when it comes to building your own meal as compared to Greens & Proteins (their neighbor across the lot) but there are more options to choose from. The one thing I do like is that their sweet potato mash (huge portion) is like real sweet potato unlike at G&P it seems less condensed? If that makes sense. Their stevia bbq sauce is also delicious with the bison (Their bison portion is smaller than G&P) and elk. Haven't tried much YET, but this is definitely my new preference. One thing I would probably recommend - they probably have this option and I haven't asked yet - is to have some steamed veggies. They've only been open for a couple of months but it's definitely worth the try!!",

Cons: Could be a bit more informative about their menu.  They have such a great outdoor space and totally need to dress it up.  Candles on the tables at night,  some fresh flowers in table top vases and potted patio plants would really help.   Overall love this place but they need some style in the decor.",

    "text": "I have been wanting to try this place for awhile and today was my opportunity. I really wanted a  yummy protein shake . I saw pictures on the door for the protein shakes so I was happy to give them a try. I walked in and was immediately pleased yet a bit overwhelmed by the menu on the wall. I read and looked and tried very hard to find the list of protein shakes , they were not on that menu on the wall.I had to yell out to the girl behind the counter. She seemed not at all pleased that I was there and didn't know what to do. She was just unfriendly and looked miserable at her job. I was at the S. Durango location at approximately 1:30 pm.  I asked her if they had protein shakes and she said yes they are on the menu then she turned away. I said hey I'm sorry , this is my first time. I read the large menu again and still could not find the shakes. A customer then showed me the printed laminate menu which did have the shakes listed. Ok, so I chose the Hawaiian. I then had to ask the girl , do you accept cash or do I have to swipe my card on the iPad . She said they accepted cash and then I ask, So do I just order here on the iPad , she again seemed like I was a terrible interruption to her day. I tried to press the screen on the iPad to order but could not seem to figure it out. Nothing came up , the screen did nt provide a menu. I tried and tried and the other people just stared at me . I was so uncomfortable and felt so awkward because I had no direction of how to even order a protein shake and I couldn't even get a human to help me. So ridiculous that employees are standing 2 feet in front of you and can't help. Honestly , I said it was my first time in , well I guess it's my last time too. It would be helpful to be kind to new customers and try to assist if they look like they might be struggling to figure out your system. Great way to alienate people. Great concept , would ave loved to try more of your foods and other items .",

It took him like 10 minutes to make 3 drinks and he kept reading the ingredients.

    "text": "First off, my boyfriend and I LOVE the food here, much preferred over Greens and Proteins! Delicious with lots of options, especially if you want vegan or paleo. But, we've had some pretty bad customer service experiences here. The last time we went we ordered online, and went to pick it up. The boy up front (although nice) seemed clueless when we said we were there for our order. I also asked for extra sauce which I did too notate on the order in the comments. Well, we ended up waiting 20 extra minutes and our food had already been ready, just sitting there. The only reason we got our food then was because we were so impatient that we asked. Boy up front seemed confused and gave us the order per our command to check (the bag was right next to him). Also, my extra sauce was definitely not in there. The vibe was not great as customers seemed angry with the long wait times. This experience does not make us want to come back, but we also love the food. Possibly plan on waiting extra for your food if you are getting it to go.   Update: Tried to go back to the other location and my kale was forgotten in my build your own meal. My boyfriend had to sit and wait again for a to go order. Protein Source, get your staff going for real on the efficiency. Everyone is so nice but also we need our food.",

I thought I'd try it out and cheat on Greens & Proteins(another similar restaurant across the parking lot) today! I'll be fair and give a 3 star rating. The lacking of customer service most definitely cost them that additional star. When I arrived I wasn't acknowledged immediately and to me it seemed as though they may have been understaffed? Looked like a total of 4 people working. There was a nice young lady that was making from what it looked like the to go orders as well as the people who were dining there. I didn't wait extremely long but after about 7 mins there was another worker that came from outside and took my order. They have a pretty sketchy credit card machine it took him 3 swipes to finally get my card to go through ? Hmmm says they have been having issues with it but anyways. I received  my Green Monster protein shake and I must say that it was nothing to write home about! I then asked the employee for a menu and before handing it to me she had a bit of a disclosure to go with it.. \"most of the items on this menu we no longer offer and also some of these prices are not the same\" I chuckled and thought to myself then why in the hell even give me a menu that's not even valid? Yikes! I think with the money they may or may or be making its absolutely crucial to offer your customers the most up to date menus at all times! How am I suppose to want to recommend them to anybody by passing on an incorrect menu? O_o yeah umm I think I'll stick to Greens and Proteins!",

Some yelper named Edith was extremely critical , almost referring to staff members as psychologically damaged, possible jealousy on this woman's behalf  perhaps. I just hope the manager didn't dismiss people because of her  review, you're a cruel and sick woman you probably complain everywhere you go! Do you like getting young people fired, you basically suggested they do that, thats extremely vindictive ; what were you like when you were a teenager around 18 or 19. You gave backhanded complements and referred to staff as lost souls, to me you are the one with no soul. You made personal attacks on these young people and  some of the things you said  are disgusting. If the upper management fired people because of your reviews alone then I wont be back there especially if I  don't see the same people I won't  go back there anymore! As for the managers of this place, if you take what one person says as the overall opinion of everyone I think you should go back into training!",

    "text": "Long story short: tasty, clean, healthy food. Nice portions for a balanced meal.   Some background:  I was here on business and staying at the Hampton Inn. I travel a lot for work and eating out every night gets old. I try to find healthy places to eat.   They make food the way I would make at home, simple ingredients, lighty seasoned. Portions were just right and prices were reasonable for the quality and ingredients.   Lunch: ahi tuna bowl, not just a few pieces, but the entire filet seared just right and sliced. I subed in quinoa instead of the veg mix. It comes with olive oil/soy dressing on the side. Next time I would like a cap so I can mix the dressing together before putting it on, it was separated and hard to mix. Tasted great and made me feel great afterwards! I was full but not sluggish. I would order again.  Dinner: Elk burger, it was pretty good. I had never eaten elk before, it is a little dry for my taste, idk if thats the meat or it's cooked to long? The mustard spread and bbq that comes with is nice. Sweet potato hash with shallots and kale, seasonings was also tasty. Again, clean, tasty meal. I think I would try something else before ordering this again. Bison burger next...   I also had the antioxidant juice: beets, carrots, ginger, apple, kale, spinach. Sweet, they keep the fibers in.  Since they're new and feedback is always nice, sitting under the red tent outside during lunch hurt my eyes.. it kind of makes you squint the whole time. Just sit inside if it bugs you too. Overall, I'll eat here again. They just opened a few weeks ago. So far so good. Hopefully they can keep the reasonable prices and friendly service. Owner is really nice, I overheard conversations and it sounds like he knows his stuff so he'd probably give you some great free workout/eating right advice.   Nice job protein source! Thanks for a good meal. I'll be back before I go home.",

I ordered their big boy bison burger with a side of their sweet potato \"hash\"   $15 without a drink.   The taste of the burger was fine. However the only thing big boy about it is that they throw a heaping handful of lettuce on it to make it look big.   Now, the sweet potatoes hash pissed me off. It was a microwaved sweet potato that wasn't even cooked all the way through.   You don't call something a hash that is microwaved.   I was wondering why this place was dead at lunch rush when it used to be packed.",

    "text": "First of all, we always love going to the protein source on S. Durango. Never had a problem there. This time we tried this one and what a disaster! I didn't like the turkey chili because it was so strong and salty. So my husband went in and told them we didn't like it because it tasted too salty. So, the owner comes out, a tall burly guy, and instead of offering another order of food or saying something to my husband like, \"oh I'm sorry you didn't like it, we will refund your money, we don't put regular salt into our chili but we do put this or that to be an alternate for the salt\". My husband is a quiet, non complainer but he said the owner came off very rude to my husband who's been a chef and worked in the restaurant industry for about 30 years now. If anything, my husband said the owner could have been better with his manners and customer service. So I was mad about it. I called and I tried to explain with some choice words (because I was pissed by then) to one of the workers while I waited to speak to the owner on the phone. The worker hung up on me... now if you're going to hang up on me (which I was going to go inside now because I was actually in the car), I'm assuming you don't want to deal with me, then don't come out busting through the door like you're about to go gangster on me, which is what he did, he came outside before I went in and he started running his mouth (again, they need classes on how to deescalate not escalate any situations), so I ran mine. We were going back and forth and then the owner comes out like gang buster and says, \"so what's the problem here!\" Like he's all tough! I told him and he kept interrupting me and kept saying, \"didn't I refund you?!\" (he clearly doesn't know how to deescalate a situation). I told him it was all about his attitude. If you're going to refund someone at least have a good customer service attitude, instead he kept saying that there's no salt and normally they don't refund like it was such a bother to refund $10 and he acted like he was doing US a favor LOL!!  So, when we were outside we kept asking why it was so salty, he couldn't answer and explain nicely to us if there was a substitute for the salt or whatever makes it taste salty. He kept saying maybe it's the meat, maybe the recipe is wrong blah blah blah. But we kept pushing why it was so salty, and to that he just skirted around and didn't want to deal with us anymore and said, \"I already refunded you, have a great day!\" and he walked away. Unbelievable! He couldn't and wouldn't answer a customer's question. He could have handled it waaaay better than he did. I think he was trying to intimidate us and it didn't work. They guy who came outside first also has the same attitude as his boss, absolutely no customer service and they don't know how to deescalate a situation, instead they throw more fire into it. This girl is NOT having none of that! I will make sure I spread this far and wide. I hear he is the owner of both Durango and Flamingo location, that's why he thinks he can have that kind of attitude. Bumbye you learn bruh! Here's a dictionary lesson for the owners, learn to deescalate and NOT escalate situations. Please, have a company seminar on this  deescalate[ dee-es-kuh-leyt ] Main Entry: lessen Parts of Speech: verb Definition: lower, reduce Synonyms: mitigate, dilute, erode, slacken, minimize, ease, shrink, impair, dwindle, decrease, abate, narrow, diminish, curtail, lighten, weaken, decline, cut, clip, taper, abridge, attenuate, degrade, crop, downsize, soft-pedal, drain, contract, amputate, truncate, close, moderate, thin, cut back, taper off, minify, de-escalate, become smaller, die down, grow less, roll back, slack up, slow down, take the bite out, take the edge off, take the sting out, wind down  de-escalate [dee-es-kuh-leyt] verb (used with or without object), de-escalated, de-escalating. to DECREASE in intensity, magnitude, etc.  Update*** So the owner wants to reply and says I used abusive and intimidating behavior. What a joke! I'm just about 5 feet tall, but they wanted to come out of their establishment and try to intimidate us. They came off that way to us, so of course they got an ear full of attitude and language. The owner is about 6 ft tall and looks like he's on steroids, probably accounts for his gangster mentality and behavior and his employees behave the same.  Update*** I noticed the owner changed the original comment to my review, doesn't matter to me. This review will probably stay right here. So, who was being racist? Certainly not us Lol! Is that the only card they can pull out? Stop the craziness already.",

The Hawaii Salad I got was bland, Unappealing looking, & was brought out on plate vs a bowl, so made it harder to eat. It took awhile too. Plus, the staff was rather lethargic and didn't have a welcoming personality to them. To be honest, it doesn't appear as if the owners consulted anyone with restaurant experience or knowledge when they decided to open this place. I was really looking forward to another healthy place to eat at, but was sadly underwhelmed and severely disappointed with this place. Unless they make some major changes to their menu (better display, more organized, less corn, have a calorie count) I doubt I'll try it again.",

The owners think I'm a Greens and Proteins supporter and therefore I gave them a bad review. I've given G&P bad reviews for bad service too. I'm not biased. Bad food is bad food.   Over priced, tasteless food. First and last time here. Ordered the scramble. They give you three ingredients to put in the scramble, but only give you four ingredients to choose from. I got the whole eggs and it's supposed to be three eggs and it looks like two eggs. They charge $3.50 extra for turkey bacon. It's was literally shreds of turkey bacon. The sweet potato hash is inedible. It's boiled sweet potatoes that are grilled after. They taste like nothing. Greens and Proteins is way better. The place smells like farts too. The only reason I'm giving them two stars instead of one is, because the girl who helped us was nice.",

They give options to build your own or they have about 15 on the menu to choose from as well.  The food is excellent and tasty.  It's not the cheapest lunch in town (around $8-12 for a meal), but the quality makes it worth the extra few bucks.  The food is freshly prepared and the restaurant has a fast casual feel.

They had called us to ask us to come back, but they also asked that we bring the dish that wasn't ours. Which I thought was odd but we did as they asked.   Long story short they ended up giving the order we brought back to the customer who actually ordered it. GROSS.  Any ways- this was almost two months ago. So today we decided to give it another shot.   This time my husband called ahead to place our order and asked if the chili had beans. He dislikes them. The woman on the phone confirmed that there were no beans. She actually put him on hold to confirm with the chef.  We also ordered the signature smoothie and a breakfast sandwich.  So this is how our second time went: We paid $10 for chili WITH beans. We were going to bring it back but i have better things to do than run around town because you guys can't get your orders straight.  The sandwich could've been better. It just wasn't good. And the smoothie was really good.   I decided to check Yelp out to see if we were the only ones experiencing this... Turns out we aren't- but what's even more unfortunate it the managements response to their customers. So rude and condescending. Shame on you!  I will not be spending another dime here, and will not be recommending it to friends or family.",

It would be nice to have flatware instead of plastic ware in a picnic style service especially for the price of the meal. Maybe that's why they spend the funds on the quality ingredients instead of flatware. I had the light start breakfast and it was perfect. Turkey sausage was juicy, eggs as I requested. I will return and bring others!",

I've had some of the wraps, bowls, salad and fresh sashimi style choices as well. My friends that I have invited to try it with me loved it as well. The price point might be higher than some but it's so worth it by having high quality fresh food. You can also order in advance and they are also part of the Perka app that racks up points towards future purchases.   There is no reason to not try it! Something for everyone.",

I live right down the road and when I went to eat the bowl, as soon as I got home, it was soup! Nothing like yesterday or how it's described. Totally disappointed and still hungry since that was supposed to be my breakfast. So far it's inconsistent not like their competitors across the way (Greens and Proteins).  *That's interesting because my husband ran in and paid cash. I doubt he asked for a receipt. Like i said at that time the absolute only customer there. Not gonna argue over $10 just would like people to know my experience.",

I called and spoke to the male who helped me, explained my dissatisfaction and informed him that I would like a refund. I was told that he could not do that and referred me to email the company and inform them of what happened so that they could decide.... he also advised to take a pic of my receipt to send with the email.

Not to mention, your staff is rude and act like customers are more of an inconvenience than welcome. No smiles, more of a forced \"hello\" every time i come in. I was confused if i was back in the gym or getting food, being as though there is a mediocre uniform code. Your male cashier in the evenings consistently has his headphones in, which causes personal discomfort when trying to order. A girl with colored hair, was the only genuine seeming cashier. She would be the only reason I come back. Lastly, the attitude and treatment towards my boyfriend and I (we're gay) was astronomically rude! A successful business doesn't include homophobic managers.  Once again, a joke!",

I than no it's really not. I'm Really disappointed about the service.  Update today.  To the Owner. I just visited the restaurant and the cashier and manager gave me a hard time. I explained to them what happened the last time I came here and they didn't seem to really care.

But it was much, much, too watery. And it's a shame, because the chicken was super super tender, very tasty, with no fat, trimmed perfectly. The chicken was perfect in the chili.  But again, the base of the chili was terrible, it came across as just all water mixed with diced tomatoes and black beans. Need to thicken it up and give it a more robust chili texture and some more ingredients to thicken it up.   I got the salmon wrap. The salmon stunk so bad inside the wrap that the other customers where actually looking at us and you could tell they were disturbed. Salmon if and when cooked properly does not smell like that! It stunk so bad, that I asked for a To-Go box, wrapped it up, ran out of the place, got in my car, and dumped it behind a 7-11 where I've seemed a few stray cats. I know I'm nuts, but I'm not crazy enough to eat salmon that smells as horrible as it did to feel the need to be polite to strangers inside the establishment with me and to run out and get fresh air myself. The salmon stunk!  I also had a smoothie. It wasn't as good as other places, bland if anything.   I feel bad, I wanted to like this place, and the potential is there, but it just wasn't a good first experience. I hope for their sake, they fix their chili, learn how to order, store and cook salmon so it doesn't stink like that, and perhaps put more flavor and sweetness into the smoothie I ordered.  Good luck.",

Called an order in on sunday april 30th at 2:24 pm to assure i wouldn't wait long for my food, i arrived there at 2:38 paid and didn't receive my food until 3:30 the employees Apparently forgot to start my ticket and half an hour in when i finally though my food was ready i was asked \"sorry what was your order there has been miscommunication?\" And i had to wait half an hour longer for a simple turkey burger, when i finally received it, not a single im sorry for the wait or can i offer you something to drink? They just sort of brushed me off so i most definitely wont be going back to them anymore i will take my money to greens and protein instead, cant be waiting an hour for a burger",

    "text": "Food is TOP-NOTCH quality and very balanced nutritionally. I rarely every stay in the place to eat my food --- It's my favorite TAKE-OUT place for sure! Portions are good and I'm always full when I'm done. The fresh salsa is awesome when dumped over a bowl of ANY PROTEIN, mixed veggies and some avocado. The best $12-$14 spent when I want healthy food!!  Elk (deer family) and Bison (slightly sweeter and richer than beef) meat?? I KNOW -- I wasn't so sure about these options at first, but after some research I learned that they both have less fat and more protein than beef - and both are grass-fed and hormone-free.  Be sure to get the PERKA app for their loyalty program!!  That's the end of my relevant review for this place - the following is something I feel I must put out there as a fellow small business owner.   YELP is truly great and I use it to find everything from Auto Services to Dentists. It's also some of the most important marketing for a small biz and the power is all within the hands of the people -- as it should be. Pretty win-win!! But when \"the people\" use their power for ego-driven purposes and put unfair and permanent marks (the star-rating) against a company, it slowly diminishes the value that is the Yelp system.  It amazes me when someone gives 2 or 3 stars and then goes on and on about how \"Delish\" the food was. It's misleading and skews the overall rating when you give a low rating because of some princess-like, emotional response to things like a sign and the music being played. Pay attention to the energy you bring -- I've been here at least 15 times and have had several different people wait on me and NONE of them have ever had attitude -- it's only 1-2 minutes of face-time with them (even if you dine-in) and you make it sound like they chose YOU specifically to be rude to, or that you're reviewing some fancy dine-in restaurant where you're also paying for the dining experience. That's NOT THIS PLACE. I assure you, most of the $'s you're paying here is going into the food and food prep.  And that's MY emotional response to that!",

Clearly they are passionate about fitness and making truly healthy creations.  I got the steak and eggs to go and loved it.  No upcharge for 6 egg whites is a crazy good value (I hope they have the appropriate food costs to stay afloat).  The steak was cooked properly and the BBQ sauce was delicious.  Finish it off with some superfood sweet potato hash and you have a great meal.  The dining area is quite comfortable looking and has some outdoor space too.    The staff was very attentive and friendly.  Of course I fire in a few dollars to the tip jar on carryout, but many do not without an option to tip on the bill.  Add in this feature online and you will be rewarded without alienating any customers.  I'm rooting for you guys and will be doing my personal best to help this take off by using you as my go-to take out location.",

Simple as that. I get customer service can be a pain at times but you signed up for it when you chose to work at this establishment. I won't rip them apart about how long it took to get the food and drink, it was a lunch rush but customer service is what makes or breaks your business. Very poor service.

It came with a side salad with the delicious lemon dressing, and the entire portion size was big enough for me to have leftovers for later.

The salad dressing is legit to die for, I told the staff today that the owners should bottle the dressing up, and sell it because it's that good!   Today I ordered steak teriyaki wrap on spinach, this was my first time having this specific wrap , but so delicious! Super fresh, well cooked veggies, just the right amount of steak, and the teriyaki sauce was great, being that it's not sweetened with sugar! I definitely will order this dish again!

    "text": "Price reasonable ,but had an issue with the customer service !  When placing a order I ordered a big boy bison burger in which I've never tried before . Now upon waiting for my order one of the employees signaled me that my order was ready, so I picked up my order another employee asked me did I order any drinks or anything else and I clearly said no just the bison burger , now I got all the way home and they had given me the wrong order . So I called since I live 25 mins away and let the employee know he said no problem sorry about that I thought your name was Carl that's why i signaled you for the order but no problem I got you on the next one. So I went in the next day after the gym and instead of owning up to his word like he said on the phone he said I have to ask \" the cook \" not manager if he could comp the meal keep in my mind I was placing another order for something else so I was still buying something regardless . Employee comes out and says the cook will make you something else if you can bring the food back in free of charge ! At that point I'm like so you want me to bring something back in which if you said that over the phone I would've gladly brought it back since I don't like seafood like that and he said yea if you can. Yea I don't see myself eating there at that one maybe a different one since it felt like the employee was trying to put it on me that he gave me the wrong order. It's not like it was super busy that night it was only 3 people in there that night but it still gets some type of stars for the for the price and menu at least smh .",

    "text": "I stopped in tonight after my workout to check this place out. I normally go to Greens and Proteins but wanted something different. I ordered the berry filet wrap, and I was so excited to eat a delicious, healthy meal. I immediately noticed that the salad came with a cup of something. A quick fork dip confirmed that it was oil. I thought that was a little weird. One bite of the salad told me that it was supposed to be some sort of salad dressing but was really comprised of about 99% oil. Aaaaand...my salad was floating in it. Sigh...I begrudgingly ate the oily salad and then moved onto the wrap. When I picked it up, I noticed the bottom of the wrap was soaked in the same oil (see pic). The greens that were inside the wrap had also been drenched in the oil. Awesome...so much for a healthy meal. Come on, Protein Source, people come here expecting to get a healthy meal. All of that added (completely unnecessary and over the top) oil has just negated all the hard work I put in at the gym. If I hadn't just forked out over $12 for that dinner, I would have walked away.",

We were hesitant to order salmon because we're from the east coast but ordered it anyway because it was wild caught (the only kind we will order). It was better than any salmon we've ever had. Our dinners were served piping hot, with every vegetable cooked to perfection. Our server was friendly and accommodating but never in our way. The owner was on site and took a lot of time out to talk with us afterward. He's clearly proud of his work and should be! We have friends and family who regularly travel to Las Vegas. You can be sure we'll be encouraging everyone we know to dine at The Protein Source. If you're looking for healthy and high end food at a price that seriously can't be beat, get out and try it! You'll be back. We will for sure.",

They messed up both me and my boyfriend's to-go order last night but this is the first time it's ever happened so I wasn't upset. Also we both agreed that the food was too tasty to be mad.  I always order the Mediterranean Quinoa... so delicious! I've also had the Western Avocado Salad (minus the cheese) but this was meh at best. Last night I ordered the California Cobb wrap (also without cheese) and in a cabbage wrap. While I was bummed because the eggs were completely missing and it was hard to eat because it kept falling apart, it was still very good. I was actually very surprised at how much flavor it had with and without the dressing included on the side. I loved it and will be ordering it again (please don't forget my eggs next time!). My boyfriend had the Steak Lovers Bowl and although he asked for jasmine rice and got brown rice instead, he also said it was super delicious. Eh, we were still pretty hungry after but we did just finish a Pilates workout.  Additionally, I love the people that work there. They're really smiley and very helpful. I always appreciate them!  The downside for me is the price. The Mediterranean Quinoa always seems great to me because if I'm under $10 for lunch, I'm happy... and it's well under that. In fact, all their salads are reasonably priced unless you add a protein, which I never do. But between two of us last night, we nearly spent $30. And that's just entrees, we didn't order any drinks. That's a problem because that's the price you'd spend for 2 entrees at a nice sit down place. I know they use quality ingredients but The Protein Source is more of an after-gym-healthy-bite-to-eat spot and I think some things should be less expensive. If they were, I would eat here more often than I already do. I usually meal prep my own protein, carb, and green and if they lowered the prices a bit, I'd do build-your-owns here pretty often. Though that's my gripe, I will say that they have made positive changes to their menu recently. Being a healthy spot, I was shocked they didn't have nutritional information posted. Their menu now has this info which is great!  Tip: Check in on Yelp for $1 off a protein shake or juice :)",

In that plaza, there were about 3 other establishments that offered similar healthy fare, yet all I wanted was a protein shake.  Their menu was impressive, and so I settled in on the Hawaii. (Banana, Strawberries, Pineapple, Vanilla Whey Protein and Coconut Water)  It was filling, and balanced, even though it had 360 calories in it.  It did have 23g of protein and a whopping 69g of carbs.  It would have been a great post-workout shake...but...uh...I hadn't worked out.  LOL.  Good thing it was gluten-free...uh...I guess.  Nothing much to see here, but there is likely something here that most people who are on a paleo or gluten free diet.  Not too bad.",

I also ordered an egg too which was well made (over medium).  Place was kept clean, employees were friendly and prices weren't bad.  Would like to come back and check out their protein shakes and lunches/dinners.  Why there is another protien place (Greens snd Proteins) in the exact same shopping center very close to this location is beyond me...poor planning by the landlord as Im sure these businesses cannibalize each other as they offer pretty much the same thing.)",

    "text": "My go-to: Turkey Chili and a juice.  The restaurant is pretty small but there's never been a time that I've dined in and it was busy. Seems like most of their business is take out or online orders. Outdoor seating is available but it's Vegas so there's only so many times in a year that you can actually use it.   Pros: The majority of what I've eaten has been just GOOD. I've tried all the juices and there's not one that I don't like. Wraps are not bad either. Everything is usually very light yet filling.   The staff is always very helpful and if you're having trouble figuring out what you want to eat, they'll guide you towards what to get based on what you're looking to get.   Cons: Flavor on the chili is inconsistent. Sometimes it's phenomenal, other times its salty AF. It's my fav item here and makes me pretty sad when it's not the way that I like it... Not salty!   The only thing that I was BEYOND disappointed in was their veggie burger. If there's a veggie burger some where, I will likely order it. Burger or \"Burger\" patties are supposed to be firm and should actually have a firm bite to them. Theirs is mushy and was like biting into mashed potatoes. It wasn't fun and I didn't end up eating the rest of it.",

The wrap comes with a side salad, which I've always thought it silly because essentially my wrap is a salad burrito, why would I need MORE salad, so I always substitute for sweet potato fries, ALWAYS. Last night I called to place my order and sub the salad for fries, I'm told I can't do that anymore due to new policy and I have to order a side of fries, so fine, I order the side of fries for $4, four dollars...FOUR dollars. I expect to receive so many fries I don't know what I'll do with all of them. Instead I get the smallest side of fries I've ever seen and I paid four fricken dollars for them. Is there some sort of sweet potato shortage that I don't know about?!  Out of pure principal I can't eat here anymore until this fee for substituted fries is handled, it's ridiculous guys.",

Since I order the same thing all the time I've weighed it at home since I keep track of my marcos, and it definitely wasn't 6 oz. I usually let it slide but this situation is just...wow. I told the workers and they starred at me like I'm stupid (girl with glasses and a African American girl).

The restaurant is clean and bright, and they have lots of options, from burgers to bowls to salads. I went for the turkey burger, which was paired with a really fantastic strawberry jam. It was quite filling and not too pricey (approx $11). It came with a side item as well. My sweet potatoes were fine, but could have used more seasoning or flavor.  I may not get a hankering for healthy food (at least food that I don't prepare myself) again anytime soon, but I know that the Protein Source is a solid option if and when I do.",

I walked in and was met with loud music. There are just a few tables inside with lots more tables outside under a covered dining area. To get a menu, you have to kind of cut the people in line to get one from the register where you order. It would be nice if they had a slot or something where you could pick up the menu when you first walk in.   Prices are a bit high for most of the food. The food seemed good quality, but the chicken terriyaki bowl I got was dry. It came with soy sauce but who wants to drench their entire bowl with soy sauce just to make it less dry?? It negates the idea of a healthy meal. It came with grilled pineapple on chopped up chicken breast, with steamed veggies and white rice. There was a very light drizzle of terriyaki over it but not enough to make it less dry. Meh.   The menu does look really good and perhaps other meals aren't as dry. They serve breakfast all day, and they have wraps, burgers, juices, and build your own dishes. Some of the prices were too high for me to want to try things I'd normally want to try. I guess it's paying for quality & freshness. They don't have soda, but they do have vitamin water & teas.   The employees did seem really nice and the restaurant was very clean. Overall, not bad but also not great.",

    "text": "One thing I've noticed about these health food restaurants that are popping up near gyms in Vegas is how cut throat it is. I rejoiced when I first moved to Vegas and discovered Greens & Proteins off of Eastern. I loved the concept of healthy, good quality, fast casual, in the same center as my gym. Then shortly thereafter, another similar restaurant moved right down the street, instead of near a different gym and I was like, WOW that is hardcore! Reminds me of what Starbucks used to do to all the mom and pop shops to run them out of business. I wondered if both businesses would be able to survive. As of now, they are both still in business. Yesterday, I was in the area and had this place bookmarked for a long time so I finally checked it out. Low and behold, I noticed there was a Greens & Proteins in the same exact center. Not sure who was there first and who muscled their way in on the other but yeah... I think it's safe to say that the competition with this niche type of restaurant is pretty fierce. And Protein Source sure brings it! *insert arm flexing emoji here*  I am very impressed with the food they serve at The Protein Source. Dare I say I like it better than that other place because they have a more exciting menu. I like it so much, I'm going back again today to try something new. I ordered the Lean Mean Ahi Machine Bowl along with a Kale Berry Bomb salad. Both were delicious and they also got rave reviews from my health nut friend.  This location is not close to me but I do love their food. I probably will not be back again unless I happen to be in the area. I wish The Protein Source would take a chance and come out to the Henderson or Southern Highlands area so I can become a regular customer. There's plenty of other gyms/yoga studios to set up shop next to. We need good healthy food like this here! They could definitely count on my business about three times a week or more.  Update: During today's visit I learned that they have a little caveman icon on their menu to represent Paleo friendly meals. Lord help me. I'm officially in love and I'm on my knees begging now. Please open another store near me!",

In the instructions I asked for NO cheese and NO rice. As soon as I picked it up all I saw was rice. Took the cabbage wraps off so I could just eat the meat and it was 80% rice and 20% meat. And that's a generous estimate. To top it off there were a few shreds of cheese (probably 6) which makes me think me they had the cheese on it and someone picked it off, and that alone kind of worries me. Really wanted this to be my go to place for healthy customizable eats, but I better keep looking.",

The two items I've had so far are the Energy Cakes and the American Muscle Bowl.    Energy Cakes:  Simply fluffy and delicious. Great portion size and they're topped with wonderful fresh fruit and shredded coconut.  The side of agave nectar adds just the right amount of sweetness, but to be honest you almost don't need it.    American Muscle Bowl: DELICIOUS AND FILLING! Ground Bison, Sweet Potatoes, Avocado, Zucchini, Broccoli with a side of Stevia BBQ sauce.  Honestly, it didn't need the sauce.  The meat was so full of flavor and juicy!  I love this dish because you have everything you need: Healthy Fats, Fiber, Cruciferous Greens and Protein.  Can't wait to go back and try one of those burgers.  My only little bugaboo(which I didn't factor into my rating) was that they don't have whole milk for the coffee.  I know they're trying to be healthy with skim milk, but whole milk is much healthier for you.",

It's that there's some weirdness about this place.   1. There's a sign on the door which leads out to their beautiful, shaded patio with ceiling fans that says \"Please do not sit on patio\". No explanation as to why. Why can't I enjoy the beautiful weather outside? Especially since you are running a ceiling fan out there. 2. The music they play is horrible house type music you would hear in a dance club. It is way too loud and gave me a horrible headache. 3. The cashier was completely uninterested in smiling, being welcoming or doing anything but the bare minimum the job requires. When I asked about nutrition info, she said when her partner came back he'd be able to estimate it for me. No one followed up, and I saw the someone return. 4. When I ordered my salad I asked if they had wi-fi. Ms. Apathetic said yes. I tried to connect when I sat down and of course I needed a password, which I had to ask her for. What the heck? Why wouldn't you just tell someone that asked about wifi what the password is? BTW it is healthy2eat in case you need it too.  I left feeling like because I am not ripped and \"in shape\" she felt like I had no business being here. I think the delish food alone won't help this place survive. Time will tell I guess.",

The food is all made in-house, the flavors are dead-on, and service is always amicable. The portions are generous, but because the ingredients are fresh and organic, they're never enough to feel guilty about. For the price point, the Protein Source is a high-quality place for a meal, juice, or shake at any time of the day.",

I love a good sweat fest, but I am not dedicated to it as a career. Luckily, the staff are friendly and the menu has options to satisfy just about anyone who walks in and simply wants something a bit healthier than the average meal out.  The Breakfast Smoothie is not on the menu any longer, but an awesome start to the day with your choice of base (whole, fat free, or almond milk), plus natural peanut butter, strawberry, banana, and coconut flakes- pretty similar to what I make on my own, but a safe option for your first trip over here.   Other favorites include the protein pancakes and their various bison dishes- looks to be best in their burgers. They also currently have a Yelp check-in discount offer for $1 off a protein shake or juice- stop by before or after your next LVAC workout!",

I ordered the Bigboy Bison with bison burger on oatmeal Greek yogurt whole wheat buns, caramelized onion, 3 egg whites or 1 egg, cheddar, romaine, tomato, and house sugar free BBQ sauce for 12.99 with a side of sweet potato hash.   It was a real winner. I never had bison or elk and was hesitant but I would have never known the difference between bison and beef. I enjoyed the sweet potato hash and I have to say not everyone knows how to make a sweet potato taste good, but they did it just right simple but tasty. I am also happy to not see \"tofu fries\" which I am not sure how fried is healthy.   I am looking forward to them having the calories, protein, fat, etc on their menu, I was told that is on it's way to happening soon. This did not taste healthy at all and I believe that it is, but wow how was it so good? I want to see the calorie count for proof then I am sold for sure.   I can't wait to go back and try other items, I hope they are just as good as what I had.",

If i factor in going to the sauna after my workout and then getting ready to leave, get here to order, and then wait, it takes too long. Nobody likes a hip, s l o w , restaurant.   Doesn't matter if you get for here or to go. It will take you a good long while; and on top of that if there are maybe 2 people ahead of you, good luck it adds even more time.  Oh and to make matters worse, this makes people hangrier. Just sayin  This one factor of slowness really hurts the business and for that reason, I'm out.  P.s. food is soo good but soooooo damn slow. People in there look busy but not sure with what?  Other than that the cashiers were awesome...",

We were talking cause I was debating if I wanted to eat here or somewhere else but I did say I wanted something healthy. As we were in the car one of the employee stood in front of the door and pretended to turn off the  open sign but we knew they close at 10pm. So we got out the car and walked inside at 9:15pm. Placed our order with that same employee who pretended to turn off the open sign. After the order he told us that everything will be in to go container cause they are closing and that we are welcome to dine in and hang out if we wanted too. Some more people came in after us. One guy placed in a To go order, then a blonde girl placed a to go order too. Then one guy who seems to be a  regular walks in and orders some food. We got our food at 9:30 and the girl who dropped the bag filled with our food on the table said \"You're more than welcome to eat here but we do close at 10.\" The other two people after us got their food and left. We took our food out of the container and ate there. The guy who is a regular got his food in a bowl to eat there and his other order for to go! So because he is a regular you will give him his food on a dish to dine in? My boyfriend said at the other location don't do that. They will let you dine in not pack things in a To go container and try to kick you out by ten. The employee were like rushing us because they close at 10 and they just wanted to hurry up to finish their task and close. So I guess serving our food on a dish is just too much work for them? We did not feel welcome and the staff were unprofessional. The whole time we were there the girl and guy employee were talking smack to each other loudly in front of guest. Other than what we experienced with the FOH and the service I just wanted to say the BOH made our food really good. So minus 2 stars for service. We will never come back to this location. We will stick to friendly staff, good service, and yummy food at the Durango location.",

It's definitely quality food and healthy for you.   I'd recommend this place for anyone looking for a quick bite that is healthy, packed with protein, especially after a workout at the gym. However, expect to pay $10 and up for the items on the menu.",

There's a variety on the menu such as breakfast items, wraps, burgers, salads, and bowls. My favorite is the The Steak Lovers Bowl and I usually get that. I've also tried the Turkey Bowl as well and it's pretty good. I would say the food here is healthy, fresh and great after a work out or if you're around the area. It definitely fills me up.  You can order and sit down or do to-go if you wanted to. I usually just dine in. They also have an outside area to dine at; it'll be nice in the spring time to eat out there. They also take time to cook your food though, so be prepared to wait about 15-20 minutes before your food comes out. The price here is more towards the pricey side ($12-15) depending on what you order, however I think it's worth it!   Overall, I love this place and will be back!",

    "text": "I am in LOVE! For there to be a restaurant (not a meal prep place, but an actual restaurant) that appeals to the health & fitness folks, is awesome! What makes it even better, is that their menu has SO much AND it caters to: Vegetarians, Gluten Free folks, body builders, and those on the Paleo diet. And here is why I give it 5 stars: THEY SERVE BREAKFAST ALL DAY! OH, today is also Sunday. Most restaurants close around 6 or 7pm on Sundays. THEY CLOSE AT 10PM!!!!   This place is an actual restaurant, kind of like fast food. You don't get waited on but they do serve you your meal. I am used to establishments similar to this except the establishments are meal-prep shops. Where they have a weekly menu which changes every week. The Protein Source is not a meal-prepping establishment, though you could very well order everything and refrigerate for the week :) One other thing, because I'm used to Meal Prep places with body builders and perfectly shaped women who just got out of the gym there, I was a little nervous walking into The Protein Source. But it was quite welcoming!    MY ONLY WISH is that they carried pork bacon and not just turkey bacon, and that they include high fatty meals for those of us on a Ketogenic Diet (low-carb high-fat, moderate protein diet). Or, that they include more lower carb sides. Oh I have so many recipe ideas for the owners, they WILL be getting an email from me on a few Keto dishes to consider LOL. See, on a Keto diet too much protein = sugar spike in the blood. Therefore, those of us on a Keto (which is kinda similar to Paleo) eat 80% fat. So, having pork bacon (preferably nitrite/nitrate free & uncured) would up our fats without getting too much protein.  However, I really appreciate their counts on the menu. Sadly for me, most of their Starch sides have way too many carbs for one day for me. But there are at least 2 options that were low in Carbs. AND you can create your own dish too!   After reviewing the menu for something close to Ketogenic, I ordered the Skinny Salmon dish. It had salmon, asparagus, mashed cauliflower, and a cilantro pesto (I think). What I loved was their side of mashed cauliflower. The texture was soooooo smooth! I personally don't like Cauliflower & force myself to eat it (and I usually sautee it in grass fed butter/coconut oil with other veggies). Their mashed cauli did not taste like Cauliflower AT ALL! The salmon was perfectly cooked. And the Asparagus! Let me tell you....that was cooked PERFECTLY! It had a crunch to it but it was still tender! It was not overly cooked and it was not undercooked. It's as if they grilled the asparagus only I saw no grill marks. It was just perfect! The presentation of my meal was also beautiful! The ambience is casual but you feel like you're being served fancy gourmet food because of their unique pairings, recipes, and presentation. I also loved the fact that they had NO SODA! They had a Vitamin Water fountain, with some of those bevs being sugar-free. They also had 2 \"tubs\" of freshly brewed organic tea: Black Tea & Lemongrass Tea, both unsweetened.   I haven't even mentioned their juice drinks, protein shakes, and their protein/low-sugar desserts!!!   But honestly, do yourself a favor & take a look at the menu. They even have BISON!!! AAAAAND....their dishes are reasonably priced! The most expensive dish I think is $14. Their menu has food that my kids would absolutely love AND my not-so-healthy eating-husband would ACTUALLY like! Their menu has SO much to offer! I am a new transplant to Las Vegas from California and this place is literally down the street from where I live....1 minute by car, 9 mins on foot. I WILL be coming back!",

It certainly helps that they're both located next to LVAC, too:  plenty of people who want healthy eats before or after their workouts are usually circling the area.  I'm a fan of both places.  Definitely catering to those trying to eat clean and stay lean, Protein Source offers breakfast, salads, raw juices, protein shakes, bowls (chicken, ahi, elk, bison, salmon, steak, turkey), chili (vegan choice, too), burgers (the same protein choices as the bowls plus a veggie burger), wraps, as well as illy coffee.   I like the Build Your Own Meal, where you pick your protein, carb, and green, plus a house made dressing.  My go-to is the lean ground turkey with brown rice and broccoli since I usually don't make turkey for myself at home.    The staff is always friendly and the place is spotless.  This kind of cuisine may be boring for some people (okay, a lot of people), but I appreciate these type of places that offer up a healthy alternative when one needs to take a break from all that sugar, grease, and fat.  Donuts, I miss you.",

    "text": "I had been wanting to come here for awhile to get my healthy eats on. Finally made that happen. I love their wide selection of food & drink options. Since I came w/ several people we decided to try a lot of food.  Protein waffle tower (One Whole Wheat Multi-Grain Protein Waffle Served w/Egg Whites or Whole Eggs, Turkey Sausage, Cheddar Cheese, Jalapeno Berry Jam, Sugar Free Syrup or Agave Nectar) - I love me some waffles, but sadly this wasn't up to par in my standards. The flavors didn't mesh well IMO. I ordered this, but only had a few bites.   Chocolate Chip Protein Pancakes (Whole Wheat Multigrain Chocolate Chip Protein Pancakes w/Topped w/Nutella Chocolate Chips, Protein Powdered Sugar and a Side of Sugar Free Syrup) - Probably the worst thing that is good for you on the menu. Everyone finished this shared plate.   American Muscle Bowl (100% Pure American Bison, Sweet Potato Hash, Source Veggie Mix (Broccoli Red and Green Bell Peppers, Yellow Squash and Zucchini), Topped w/Avocado and House Stevia BBQ Sauce) - This was another winner due to all the flavors that you get from this meal.  Ahi Protein Poke (Hawaiian Style Wild Caught Ahi Tuna Mixed w/Avocado, Green and Red Bell Peppers, Pineapple, Cilantro, Red Onion, Sesame Seed Oil and Sriracha Served Over House Made Agave Teriyaki Sauce) - these were def a hit w/ our group.  Salmon Salad Shooters (Fresh Cucumber Shots Topped w/Cooked Chilled Wild Caught Atlantic Salmon Tossed w/Yogurt, Tomatoes, Chopped Cucumbers, Red Onions and Lemon, Served w/a Side of Dijon Mustard and Cilantro Pesto) - yet another item that was a hit w/ our group.  Tropical Green (\"Blended\" Spinach, Kale, Mango, Pineapple & Banana) - SO GOOD! Beetphrodisac (Beet, Orange, Carrot, Lemon and Ginger) - Not my fav, but it wasn't what I ordered.  Green House (Kale, Spinach, Apple, Cucumber and Lemon) - Refreshing  W/ so many options to choose from you could come here every day for a month & still not have the same thing. It also caters to whatever type of diet you're on. Stop in to give them a try, you're gonna find something that's healthy, tasty and right up your alley.",

Took a long time to get my food and when it finally came I had to leave. As I was driving I checked my food and they didn't even put any eggs. Is it that hard to check before it gets to the customer? I guess it's both ways, shoulda checked before left, but I didn't think they would forget 1 out of 3 main ingredients to my food.",

The staff is always so kind and willing to offer suggestions. I'm a creature of habit so every time I visit i get a salmon bowl with brown rice and avocado. There are few things I love more in this world than their salmon. It's always fresh and prepared perfectly. Today i went out on a whim and decided to try the vegan chilli as well. I love places that offer meat-less alternatives because its just not a luxury you come across everywhere you go. I have to say, the chilli definitely gives the salmon a run for its money. Also, if you stop by you have to try one of their vegan cookies!! They have a few flavors but the original chocolate chip is my favorite. One of the staff members recommended it to me and I can honestly say i prefer them to normal chocolate chip cookies because theyre not as sweet.  I love that they have an outdoor seating area, although i haven't exactly utilized it yet. And i like that everything is always neat and tidy. I personally think the prices are reasonable.  At the end of the day, you get what you pay for and I don't mind spending a little more money for great quality.",

I spoke to Claud (I believe that's how his name is spelled) and Mason, who were both friendly and willing to chat with us about the menu.  The restaurant was very clean and welcoming.    I ordered the Protein Source Signature burger and it may be one of the best burgers I have ever had.  Also, the burger was very filling and had a side of sweet potato hash.  During my meal, the staff made sure to check up on me to see if I was enjoying the meal, which I was.    The Protein Source provided me one of the best meals I have ever had with great service.  I will definitely be visiting frequently.    Good luck to the competitors.",

They have many options here and everything is so tasteful and delicious :D I usually get the salad with strawberries etcetera with grilled chicken added to it. SO GOOD - it comes with this citrusy sauce and I always get it on the side. I don't know why I do it because I always end up pouring it all over the salad anyways haha My boyfriend's go to meal is the lean machine? (it has ahi tuna with grilled pineapple on top).

The atmosphere was casual and comfortable; I really like the outdoor seating area.  Now the important part... The first time I had the California Chicken Cob wrap (wrapped with cabbage to make it low/no carb). It came with a delicious side salad.   The second time I had the source burger served on an oat bun; the bison was cooked PERFECTLY!!!!!  The turkey bacon with the avocado and cheese was great and the asparagus was a great addition.  I went with the sweet potato hash as my side; it was delicious and I personally would have like it with smaller chunks of potato and a little more onion but over all a great meal.  All things considered I will surly be back!!!",

I've lived in the Centennial area of Vegas for 10 years so it's not all the time I am on this side of town, but I'm strongly considering moving because all the dang good food spots are on the south side! Including this place. I ordered the ahi bowl and it was really good!! Very flavorful. And being from Hawaii nothing will compare to my hometown but I will say after my standard \"sniff test\", \"pick at it test\", and \"sniff it one more time test\" (c'mon we are dealing with seared fish in the desert people, better safe than sorry and ya know you all do the sniff test to don't even act like you don't!) I felt safe eating it haha! The sauce that comes with it is delicious, and I am anxious to try the bison burger next. Some people around me were having wraps and they looked really good as well. I had to knock of a star though because of the price...meh...a bit expensive. BUT hey so are cancer treatments so better to spend more on healthy foods than on medical bills right? There was a slight wait but staff was nice about it and a longer wait just shows that everything is being cooked fresh. I shall be back!",

Staff was very unfriendly and horrible customer service. They didn't not offer to return my money when I told them I was in a hurry and had already waited quite a bit of time for a simple chicken rice and broccoli I plate.

The owners/managers are awesome too. I haven't had a \"bad\" choice yet off their menu. Love the Source Protein Pancake and the chili is bomb too.",
