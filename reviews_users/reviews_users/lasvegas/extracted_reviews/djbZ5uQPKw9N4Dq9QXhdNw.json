    "text": "I really can't say enough about this place but then again I am warm blooded American male with a healthy libido. For the record I know females who enjoy this place as well so it's not all a guy thing. Having said that, there's nothing on this menu that I have not liked. Try the Hangover Burger, in my opinion one of the best burgers I've had hands down. Though make sure you're hungry when you order it.   Getting to the location is a bit of a challenge, you can drop your car off at the valet on Harmon or park at Planet Hollywood. If you valet on Harmon be sure to pick it up before they close that side at around 10 or 11. Otherwise you'll have to walk to the west PH valet to get it.   The atmosphere is simply awesome. If you've had a bad day this place will certain help to forget it. They have a decent variety on tap and two house beers. The Dirty Blonde and the Naughty Brunette. The Dirty Blonde is like a summer wheat type beer like Blue Moon. The Notty Brunette is as it implies, nutty and dark like an IPA. They also have what they call a Shotsky which is an actual snow ski rigged with about 5 shots of whatever you order and what they do is line up 5 of you across the ski then they tip the ski and all 5 of you take a shot simultaneously!   The place has three levels and if you go the third level...the view. What can I say about the view from the third level. BTW, the third level is where it's at!. You can sit on the balcony and soak in wonderful LV BLVD and city center. They have a rock climbing wall that to the inexperienced eye seems easy to negotiate but these TP girls can give you a run for your money. Its certainly entertaining to watch people race up the wall. The only reason I'm giving this place 4 stars (I'd give it 4.5 if it was possible) is due to the parking situation. Though if you're a glass-half-full kind of a guy like me, you can certainly say that the walk from the parking lot to TP offers a great deal of quality 'people watching'. Let me know how it goes...Happy Drinking!",

My husband and I stopped by for an after dinner drink for his birthday.  I ordered a margarita, it was ok, there was only salt on half the rim but I wasn't too concerned that is until I got my bill and saw that that 16 ounce on the rocks margarita cost $17.99!!!!  I was in shock. I asked the waitress if the price was correct and she said yes.  Now there are no prices on the menu and it didn't say it was top shelf or had extra shots.   I didn't think to ask the cost because I was thinking it would $10 or so, it is the Vegas Strip.   I did not leave a tip and then when I got back home and was checking my bank account I see that our very unhelpful waitress added $6 to my bill.  She stole herself a tip!",

    "text": "I have been to this location of Twin Peaks twice.  If I wrote this review after my first visit, I would have most likely given it 4 stars.  But today, my second visit here, put it over the top for me.  The reason for the extra star was our phenomenal bartender Kathiee.  Not only was she one of the friendliest people I have ever come across, she was rocking out cocktails, draft beers, and refilling our drinks all while striking up a conversation with my party as well as the others sitting along the bar.  I ordered the chicken and shrimp basket and asked my chicken be tossed in their green chile parsesan sauce.  Kathiee was so great that when my food arrived, she made sure my chicken was tossed in their wonderfully delicious green chile parmesan sauce.  This level of attention to detail really meant a lot (the waitress at the Henderson location just gave me a cold side of green chile parmesan and forgot, or didn't care, I wanted my chicken tossed in that sauce).  So great job Kathiee!!!  Not to be forgotten, the shrimp in my basket were huge!!!    At this particular location, I have had the green chile meatloaf and the chicken and shrimp basket.  Both items were very good.  The meatloaf is smothered in mushrooms, onions, and gravy, but the green chile in the meatloaf adds a unique and delicious kick that I can't get over.  I would have to rate it the best meatloaf I have had.     I believe I saw 12 beers on tap from Coor's Light to an IPA to their very own house brews.  I've had both the Knotty Brunette and Dirty Blonde house beers.  The Knotty Brunette tastes like a good brown ale while the Dirty Blonde is a nice Hefeweizen.  Both are worth a try.    On both my visits, the staff and service was good.  Everyone was friendly and food came out quickly.  Not to mention it is bikini week, so that is definitely an added bonus.  But if you happen to be there when Kathiee is working, definitely hangout at her bar.  Not only is she a great bartender, she is a huge foodie and is a big fan of yelp!!!",

Food: it's basically the same as every sports bar. Nothing spectacular but not bad.   Service: had a great waitress and friendly staff all around. One of my friends insisted I climb the rock wall and have a waitress race me. Turns out they have a dedicated employee who kills the rock wall. She destroyed me. I didn't even make it up. I lost my bet to her and my friend.   Price: this is why they earn the 4th star. It's hard to find a decent place to eat on the strip without breaking the bank, eating junk, or taking forever.   Stop in. Check it out. It's a chain, but it's a fun time.",

However, all the girls working were very nice, and a weird part of me wanted to let them know they didn't have to deal with these outfits...but I guess they chose that right...  Anyways, like I said staff was always nice and helpful. We got a table on the outside patio that was great scenery to eat and hang out. I had the Greek salad which I LOVED! I highly suggest it. My husband had wings which he described as standard, ok, bar wings. We had a coupon for this restaurant which really influenced our decision on going, but I'd recommend it to others. I didn't realize it's a chain so I'm not sure if our experience was standard or not.",

Not a high water mark to meet, but they didn't.  The place had no energy, the staff only as much charm as needed before they turned back to convo they were having with the other girls in the corner. They all looked like they hated being at work and they were completely bored.   The appetizer platter was ok and the beer cold, but it was Friday happy and it was LAME.

After hours of walking along the Strip through the morning and early afternoon, my mom and I were exploring happy hour specials for food and drink. We chose Twin Peaks for its view of the buildings along the Strip and its appetizer and drink specials.  The hostess quickly seated us on the balcony as requested, and our server patiently answered any questions we had about the happy hour special. We ordered two appetizers (each 50% off; some appetizers on the menu are excluded from the special): chicken quesadillas and 6-piece buffalo wings. We each ordered a \"girl\" sized beer, also 50% off (~$3 or so). Whether the food was fresh or not, I don't know... but we thought everything was delicious! The beers also came in frozen beer mugs, which kept the beer cool on a hot day.   If you want to take a break from the Strip and grab a beer and some appetizers, Twin Peaks is a relatively cheap option in the mid- to late-afternoon with a decent view and good food.",

    "text": "So I did the first review of twin peaks vegas and now I'm gonna do another one. I STILL LOVE THIS PLACE!!! They have the coldest beer in Vegas by far. I like to drink the 29 degree Knotty Brunettes, Dirty blondes, and Dos equis(Really good ice cold with 2 limes). Now yes these man size beers are like 10 bucks but so worth it. They have a thermostat that shows you exactly how cold the beer is at the time.   This last Vegas trip was the first time I ever had anything to eat there other than the Chicken tender basket. I had the chicken and shrimp and it was probably my favorite meal in Vegas. Also did the mozzarella sticks and those were soooo bomb. I don't understand how anyone could not like the food here. Exactly what other places in Vegas have better food for the price. I would love to know.   The girls here are super nice. I was eating at a table with my friends and when my friends left....she let me move over to the bar to watch the game. There were these 2 twins working the bar that were super hot. Yeah they most def got a tip lol.   My friend did the wall but not something I really want to do. If I have one problem with Twin peaks it's that they have some strange cheese burgers. Burgers with eggs and mushrooms and stuff. Why can't they just have like a double bbq bacon burger or something. To be fair my friends loved their burgers. I just stick to my chicken and shrimp though.   Every guy in Vegas should come to twin peaks at least once. Check out the man size Dos equis with 2 limes. It's so damn good.",

A friend of ours recommended this place as a good sports bar with pretty good food and a great atmosphere so we wanted to check it out.  The restaurant was pretty full when we arrived but we did not have to wait at all. The service was decently fast and nice. The restaurant is located right on the Strip, which makes it a great stop if you're planning a party night. Unfortunately, the restaurant does not offer parking but you can easily park at one of the casino's nearby.   We share the combo basket and we chose to have the shrimp, chicken, and catfish fried. Even though it was very unhealthy, it was also pretty good for a bar chain meal. It's a pretty great deal if you can share it with someone else. This meal also came with fries which means that we weren't hungry afterwards.   The good thing about this place is its atmosphere and the friendly waitresses. Our waitress in particular was very helpful and friendly.  Overall, my experience with Twin Peaks was very positive and I would recommend it. This is a pretty great sports bar. Feel free to message me for any additional details that you may need!",

    "text": "Some people come here for the food. I come here for the scenery.   My co-worker picked this place to spend his last lunch with the office before moving back to Kansas. This was my first time here, so I had no clue what to expect. First off, the parking was a pain in the ass. We had to fight for a spot at the Planet Hollywood Miracle Mile parking lot, then walk 20 minutes (outside, then upstairs) to get to the restaurant. The restaurant had a lumberjack theme, with log furniture, moose heads plaques, fireplaces, and a massive 2-story rock climbing wall.   We were seated upstairs, overlooking the strip. I looked at the menu and decided to go with the philly cheese steak (rookie move). The servers are very prompt and the food came out fairly quickly. The cheesesteak that I ordered was massive, but it was mostly bread. The meat was seasoned with a pound of oregano, sauteed with mushrooms onions, and covered with more cheese than meat. Needless to say, this wasn't the best cheesesteak I've ever had... not even close. The fries on the other hand was delicious.Crispy, hot, and served with a special seasoning. I looked at my co-worker's foods and most of went with the burgers. They definitely looked amazing, which is probably my go-to next time.   Overall, it was a good experience. The servers are very friendly and attentive, the bathrooms are clean, the food was okay, and it was an unique atmosphere. There's a ton of TVs on the wall, so I'm pretty sure this is a great place for sporting events.   My street creds: I first got into cooking & food when I was in college. After being rejected by numerous girls and getting zero action, I decided it was time for a change. I needed a new makeover to boost my geeky image. I applied for a cooking position at a Mediterranean-Italian Restaurant near my home and learned to cook all sorts of dishes. I never became a professional chef, but I continue to enjoy & love food. 9 years later and 55 lbs heavier, I have a new passion for traveling and trying different foods around the world.",

It isn't at all busy tonight and the two girls wandering around haven't been much help to us. They basically seated us and left. A man came from the back and asked if we had been helped and then the bartender left her customers to come take care of us. The two waitresses never came back but are currently up front dancing on each other and gossiping. We have yet to receive a check, let alone be waited on... we probably would have ordered more drinks or appetizers but not now.   Too bad. I had heard great things.",

    "text": "Not the best, not the worst.. everything tasted great and the servers were all scantily clad in flannel tops cropped below their boobies, and shorty short shorts.. so if that's a reason to go.. you're all good.   We started with a beer, and two margaritas. The 22 oz 'MAN SIZE' beer is $9.. the regular pint-glass sized margarita.. was $20. Yeah.. we found that out at the end of the meal. Wasn't a bad margarita, didn't taste like a $20 margarita though. I am aware that balancing the cocktail comes into play, thus not tasting too strong or too weak.. but one shot of tequila in a pint glass makes for a slightly weak, unbalanced margarita. So on to the food. Most prices are $20 and under for entrees.. good sized portions and quality tastes.   We started with the mini Bratwurst, called the 'AVERAGE JOE'S', I believe. 3 to an order, 3 of us, so good to share for a hungry group as we expected the main course to be filling. It was.   I had Pot Roast, perfect.. hard to mess that up, but if they did it would be a disaster. It was well cooked, not over cooked, and delicious. My two dinner companions had a Pablano Chicken Sandwich and the other, had a burger.. called the 'Twin Burger' . Both were really big sandwiches and both were served with Steak Fries. (I LOVE steak fries.. these were all under-cooked and not crispy.. ) We also ordered two small sides of mac and cheese that had bacon crumbles on them.. very good, nicely al dente.. not soggy and plenty of good cheese. These were like $2 sides are were plenty due to everything else we were eating.   All in all, if you are there, near Planet Hollywood.. check it out. It's not expensive, nothing to really wow you.. but nothing bad about the food. Filling and good. My only real complaint was the $20 Margaritas. (See Photo)  Happy Eating!",

We were seated pretty quickly which was nice but the service we received once we got to our table was sub par. The waitress made us feel like we were bothering her by sitting her her sections and after taking our order we only saw her again when she dropped the food off and then the check. Never stoped to ask if we needed anything and when she dropped off the food she just dropped it off and kept walking. I have received much better service at Tilted Kilt and Hooters and they both have a locations on the strip so you may want to consider them. As far as the food goes it was what you would expect from a spot like this good but not amazing.",

This is the perfect place to check the cliche box of seeing some skin without the risk of getting anyone in hot water with their old lady.   It's like Hooters only with much better food and a fraction of the \"Delightfully Tacky\"-ness. They had some decent drink specials and about 100 TV's with every game you could possibly want on. Between being hungry, thirsty, and having a couple of bets in at the sports book, Twin Peaks was a one stop shop to just dude out for a few hours.   We left less broke and more full bellied than we would have at a strip club. If your group sounds anything like ours was then this is an awesome alternative to the Spearmint Rhino.",

Besides the fun people-watching from the balcony (facing the strip), there are probably 100 tv's around to keep an eye on your (losing) bets. The beers are cheap and come with half-off refills if you get a ridiculously large one (they filled one of those with a vodka soda for me, which is absurd... and awesome). The food? Modern and tasty. You can go fried or get avocado things. Something for everyone. The ladies... are wonderful people :). Anywho, you get the point. If you thought coming here would be awful, boring or tasteless, you're wrong. Get on out, grab a 64oz drink, some wings and hit the strip!",

Our first waitress told us that she'd get us water and the gal coming on shift would take our order. 25 minutes later another gal approached us. Seriously? What a waste? We were just about to get up and walk out. After all this time the food came out lukewarm. I will never return here. Shame on my friends that hyped it up.   Let me add that we complained to the manager and he didn't do a damn thing. This is by far the WORST service that I've ever had.",

I got a house salad ($2.99) and cup of soup ($2.99) and it was larger than what I was expecting! Hard to beat a meal for $6.00 on the strip. Plenty of toppings on my salad. Soup was decent.  My friend got the fish tacos which she really liked ($14) and my other friend got the pulled pork nachos.   These nachos are under the \"bites\" section but it's actually a platter with enough food for four. Lots of toppings!",

Once food arrived, had to get ketchup from another part of bar, had to get silverware from aforementioned table. First set was covered in dishwashing soap. Second one ok.

The missing 2 stars is for the waitress who seemed to be more bothered that she actually had to serve someone instead of talking with the male manage that night.    Grant it, I do not expect 5 star service, but you could pretend to do your job!  I travel to Vegas regularly for work and I like the Peaks because they have lots of room and TV's. Hopefully I get a better server next time?",

Instead of doing work he remained leaning up against the wall talking to all his waitresses and it seemed like he was just hitting on all them.

Instead, this is basically a Hooters-type establishment with a pacific northwest/log-cabin theme. I went here during the ncaa tournament and found that the wings were great (though perhaps not as spicy as some people wanted). They also have great shot specials and reasonable drinks. Highly recommend this as a great place to eat, drink, and watch sports.  PS- Another bizarre feature is that they have a climbing wall (its 3 floors) which the waitresses occasionally climb up. I only saw it happen once.",

Our waitress AMBER!!! Was great she gave us our food right on time we didn't have a long wait at all. She had conversations with us instead of just asking if our food was ok and ran away. She gave us this form for us to sign up for their bday club and was able to get my friend her lunch entree for free since it was her bday even tho you had to wait at least a week for the bday club to activate.

Came across this Twin Peaks while crossing over the bridges connecting Aria and Planet Hollywood/Miracle Mile Shops. Here's the thing... I travel all over the country. I've been to a LOT of Twin Peaks! There's one down the street from my house back in Fort Worth even. This Vegas location is GREAT! Food is delicious (try the Chipotle Chicken - ), beer was COLD and the girls were talkative and personal! Great change from the stoic bartenders at the uppity bars across the strip. Our bartenders were Nicoley, Texas born and raised!, and Madison, check out that smile! Best of all, the prices didn't feel like Vegas prices!  Get you a take-home, collectible, freezer mug for $20 and it'll include 32oz of any beer on draft! Basically you're getting the mug for $2! A steal for a useable Vegas souvenir!! Anyways, do yourself a favor, stop in, say hello and enjoy the girls and brews!! Oh yeah, climb the rock wall for free also!! Great way to test those \"how sober are you\" friends! Haha",

I will never return to this location. I worked at a twin peaks before so I was familiar with the kitchen closing 30 minutes before close.  we had called about 10 minutes before the kitchen was supposed to close to try and place a to go order to be courteous to the waitresses and all the staff. Craig the manager answers the phone and told us that \"Unfortunately\" they cant take orders over the phone because it was too close to close even though we were right there to pick it up. He said if we were in there they would be able to take our order. so we hurried our butts up to get in there to order our nachos. We arrived and the host was not friendly at all. She seemed irritated that we came in late. Which I understand but that's why we tried to call ahead of time for that reason. After letting her know we spoke to the manager on the phone and we were told we had to be in the restaurant in order to get food she rolled her eyes and sat us. Craig was bitching too saying \"15 minutes\" as if he wasn't the one who told us to come in. So we waited about 10 minutes to finally get drinks and order. We ordered two orders of nachos and only received one. When it came out the avocado smash on top of the nachos looked old and not fresh. And to top it off... literally top it off there was a fly crawling all over the guac. It wouldn't fly away it looked like it had been there a while because it kept walking around the guac. When we told our waitress I had felt bad because we already caused them some trouble. But I still let her know there was a fly on the food and we weren't happy. she brought it to Craig and he didn't come up to us to apologize. We were on our way out and we happened to pass him and all he had to say was \"I saw and I'm sorry\". I am so unsatisfied with the customer service, poor attitude having atmosphere, and disgusting fly infested food. I had no problem with our waitress. She was a doll and I still tipped her for wasting her time. But overall we were both super unsatisfied. I do not recommend this twin peaks at all. I say go to the one in Henderson",

Our waitress kept reminding us that \"the place is 3 floors and it's really busy\". We also overheard her telling this to every other table she was serving. I get it. It's busy. But then the manager should put more people on shift. Everything about our visit here was a negative and I regret having stopped in!",

Talked to 2nd gal, same condescending attitude and answer.   Went today about an hour b4 game and told \"we're full\" by door gals .  No help with putting name in, nothing,  just we're full and no suggestions to possibly get a table.   Sad.    Why so full of yourselves?    Hey,  Cosmopolitan has a great spots book /bar.

    "text": "I came here with a group of friends and surely didn't get what I expected from Twin Peaks. Two employees basically started an argument with us and had security kick us out. No Manager was available,  it went straight from the employee to security. It left us a little baffled. As I was walking out, a hostess SLAPPED my hand!  I contacted the Manager & their corporate office and both did nothing! In fact, I found out three days after this incident,  the hostess that slapped me was promoted! I wrote an email to the corporate office and never heard back.  I know you're probably thinking about the other side of the story here, and there is another side, of course...my group did argue back after we were told to leave, mind you we were told to leave for no reason other than a bratty hostess. But, we were NOT the ones that escalated the situation,  or started the argument!  I've been to other Twin Peaks, and always told people about them, but having this done to me and seeing that girl prompted the SAME week, left a very sour taste in my mouth. We definitely won't be going back & I share my story often because this restaurant obviously promotes bad behavior!  Definitely won't ever be going back.",

The airmen received a free meal with a purchase of a drink. So we went ahead and ordered our food. My husband ordered a cheeseburger with fries from the special military menu,  and I ordered the philly cheesesteak. The food WAS DELICIOUS!!!  The place is really nice and bigger than what it looks like from the outside. This place has 3 floors !!!!   The girls here are very pretty here and quite friendly.   Our service was consistent with Colleen as our waitress. We watched the game while we ate and it was a really relaxing time. There's A LOT of TVs here. Each booth gets its own TV, but there's plenty of big screen TVs on each floor if you have a table  .",

You get to climb against one of the girls working, I got my ass kicked and my pride hurt a little, but atleast I got a t-shirt out of it. Lastly there our plenty of pretty girls working in their lumber jack outfits.           I got a hang over burger, which was delicious, I didn't care for the fries to much. The food and drinks are responsibly priced for being smack dab in the middle of the strip.         Lastly our bartender Lena, was the best part of our visit. She was super happy and nice to us. She made us feel right at home. Cracked some jokes and enjoyed some drinks. Twin Peaks is worth a visit, especially if you're looking to watch any sporting event.",

There were sports games playing on multiple screens throughout the place. I know nothing about sports, but one of the TVs had some crazy ice race thing going on, so that was nuts and moderately interesting for a minute. You might hear classic rock playing, but it's not so loud that you can't hear your friends. It's a decent enough place to chill for a beat.  Whatever you do, watch the Twin Peaks promotional videos. They're really funny.  The pricing wasn't bad at all, the service was quick and it was a clean restaurant. Beers were super cold (the glasses were frozen). We got a nice seat in the sun on the balcony with a good view (as good as it could be for the location of the restaurant).   As a side note, and I'm not counting this against them, there is absolutely NOTHING on the menu for v*gans (asterisking it so it won't show up in searches). It would, of course, be nice if they had something, but nowhere do they claim to have anything, so I can't fault them for it. I ordered chips and salsa because it was the only thing that looked veg. Hopefully there was no lard in the chips... But I'm not sure.  Overall, it's basically Hooters. Not the classiest joint on the strip but not bad. Just a place where the waitresses happen to be wearing a tad less than what might be considered typical.",

He says in a very condensing tone \" I have no idea, what do you want me to do?  \" Really? Don't ever make the mistake of coming here. OK, so to continue on with the rest of the visit, we finally were seated after an hour and a half. After we got our drinks, security comes to our table and asks us all to leave. We are a party of 5 adults and 3 kids mind you. Completely shocked as we've done nothing wrong, we suggest they have the wrong people. After asking us 3 more times to leave, they finally realize they indeed had the wrong people. What a nightmare! The only positive I have to say is that the waitresses are amazing and do a great job.

I was also a little shocked that cut off jean shorts and skimpy flannel tops was considered a marketing tactic. Kinda like lumberjack Hooters.  Sex sells, but flannel and sexy is a combo best left for the frozen North.  This is Vegas for god's sake!",

We expected to see staff females running around in cut off jean shorts and skimpy flannel tops; however I did not see a one so that was a disappointment to our group.  If ur into watching the game this place has TVs all over so that is good.  Food is mediocre, not much flavor but probably good if ur drunk, like u should be! Hey it's Vegas people! Alas we were sober...Le sigh...  Thanks for the read.  CJ",

    "text": "Do you think two months of advance planning would at least get you in the door here?  Think again!  I booked our dinner here for a bachelor party of 14 people two months in advance and coordinated with their sales and marketing manager, Kristy Mendenhall.  She provided a contract which I signed to finalize our reservation and I stayed in contact with her up until the event to make sure we were good...  One month out, they made a minor change and kicked us from our reserved \"man cave\" onto main-floor seating.  The night of the even we showed up 15 minutes prior to our scheduled arrival time. We didn't even make it in the front door because of their unprofessional and dismissive security guard who refused to listen to me. Eventually, the general manager opened the front door and I told him about our reservations. The manager said he would have to check but never came back. We went elsewhere to eat that night.  In summary: We signed a contract two months in advance! 14 people drove from out of state for this event and never even got in the door!  I even gave them the opportunity to make up for the mistake before taking it further and writing any review.  Kristy Mendenhall apologized and said she would send gift certificates to make up for the mistake. She told me this three months ago, and still NO gift certificates have arrived. Stay away if you are planning an event here!  The good news, is after we were turned down at the door, we walked down the escalator to PBR Rock Bar & Grill, where they were happy to accommodate us and provided excellent customer service.",

The food was okay. My husband ordered the tomato bisque soup which he enjoyed. We ordered the shrimp and chicken tenders basket which was also very good. You have the option of getting your shrimp and chicken tenders blackened or fried. We got our shrimp blackened and our tenders fried. Both were very good. We ordered a side of macaroni and cheese which was just ok. It was kind of cold and the cheese sauce was all the way at the bottom leaving many of the top noodles without cheese. It was loaded with bacon on top so we didn't complain. For what the food and beverages cost, this restaurant was just ok. We paid $61 for lunch. Beers are $10.99 each and I got a small bud light for $5.49. I guess center strip Vegas is expensive but it just seemed high for what we got. Premium location on the Las Vegas strip yields premium prices.   Fun place to check out, climb the rock wall, watch the games, and chat with friends. Not a place to hang out all day long and drink...unless you want to go broke.",

    "text": "Not quite the ultimate place to view UFC.      The number of places streaming UFC on/near the strip is limited.  This was the second place we've tried.  The first under-card began at 3:30 and we parlayed that wager with other matches.  We arrived at 3:15 excited to follow our bet.  We were told by the hostess that the the UFC section of the restaurant would open at 5PM and we could enter for a cost of $15.  We spent the next 1.5 hours wondering how our wager was unfolding.  By 5PM a line for the UFC section was forming.  Everyone in line spent the next 25 minutes watching two employees struggle to detach perforated wristbands from a large sheet -- stockpiling more than the occupancy load I'm sure.  Patrons were getting restless wondering aloud \"Couldn't someone have done this preparation the night before?'  I agree.  The student council at high school dances were more practical than this management.  1 star for operations  Once we were seated in the UFC section things went better.  The atmosphere was simply great, service was friendly and our beer was always refilled promptly.  5 star service.    My thoughts on food are like many other yelpers.  Each person at the table pushed their plates away stating food wasn't tasty enough to justify consuming the calories.  1 star food.    Following the event we walked out to the balcony.  I'd pay more than $15 just to enjoy the balcony alone.  Very roomy and comfortable with a wonderful view of strip.  5 star atmosphere.    I'll pass on this place and  return to Sapphire Gentleman's Club for the next UFC event.  Sapphire is also close to strip hotels, organized, admits people on-time, has its own UFC section, seating and food is readily available, servers are friendly and when the event is over patrons walk into a lounge with another great atmosphere.",

There are so many great restaurants on the strip I would suggest checking out before this one.",

This Twin Peaks has fallen way way short of my expectations.   My server took my order 14 minutes after I was seated. 12 minutes later I receive part 1 of my order: chicken wings. Cold! I wonder how long was my order sitting there in the kitchen. 2 minutes later I receive part 2 of my order: Philly Cheesesteak. It was hot and somewhat tasty but too many mushrooms, not enough beef, not enough onions to be considered a Philly Cheesesteak.   Then there's the noise level. I get it, #1 it's a sports bar AND #2 it's Vegas but the noise wasn't coming from the customers but the rather the volume from a college football game. Why so loud? Why such poor service? Why cold wings?  The Beer? Good, pricey but good...when I finally got it!",

All the girls were very nice and helpful when we needed food and drink.    We got the Billionaire Bacon (?)  it's definitely something you should not eat often, unless you wanna die.  But it was gooooood.  Bacon, with something sweet, and smoked, and peppercorns or something.  Wow.  Artery clogger though.  I got the Shaved Turkey Sandwich, likely one of the healthier menu items.  Barely could get though half.  HUGE.  Boyfriend got one of the burgers, seemed to love it.  Everything was tasty.  Lots of TV's and a good sports bar vibe.    Special shout out to the adorable blond hostess who seated us, and had just had knee surgery, she was super friendly and told us her fave menu items when I asked, made sure we got seated where we could watch the Jets game, which made the whole experience great from the very start.    We will return when in Vegas, its a good spot for Football on Sunday's, for sure.  I bet it's good in there for Monday Night Football too.",

Me and my boyfriend waited to be seated, whomever was suppose to be the host wasn't there. A lady finally comes but she had a real awful vibe like if she didn't want to work. She asked if we wanted a table or booth and we stated table. She walks away from us saying nothing else. Comes back and point to where we were going to be seated. I suppose people aren't walked to their tables anymore. They must have been short on staff because everyone seemed like they were irritated. After a good 30 minutes finally a waitress came to take our drinks and orders. The food was good however, their staff needs to brighten up a bit. Customer service is everything and today they just didn't have any of it unfortunately.",

The restaurant has 3 floors complete with a rock climbing wall that spans all 3 of those floors. The 3rd floor has comfy booths with individual TVs as well as outdoor patio seating with great views of the Strip. Every floor has a bar and plenty of TVs and projector screens located throughout.  During the party we tried various appetizers including 4 different flavors of wings, sliders, mini hot dogs, and nachos. My table enjoyed plenty of Stellas, Coors Light and Bud Light in large ice chilled 29 degree mugs which was awesome, but also made it more difficult to chug lol.  Having only been to Twin Peaks in Texas where this franchise is a dining staple, I was pretty impressed with this one, especially with how large and spacious the venue is and the speed of service given how packed it was when we were there. The girls were friendly, efficient and sexy as with any of their locations. I will definitely be back. I just wished it wasn't on the strip because it makes it a pain to get to, especially PH!",

TIP: The one of the side of the rock climbing is the hardest don't pick that pick the one to the right of it.  The bartenders are great and super friendly! It's like hooters but mountain climbers style! LOL Food - who's paying attention to the food! Awesome beer selection!  It's on the strip so easy access!",

    "text": "Oh Twin Peaks Vegas, how I wanted to like you more.  The beer selection is slightly better than I had feared.  You close down the area of your restaurant with a view of the strip unless it is Friday or Saturday, you charge $10 for a beer.  It was from San Francisco Bay Area....not even local.  No such thing as happy hour here.  Your recommended mozzarella a sticks were limp and flat, both in taste and appearance.   I was about ready to leave and then a strange thing happened.....you changed shifts.  I got here just around 5.  Once the dinner crowd workers and customers started coming in, I disliked you less.  You started climbing walls, and shaming grown men.....but so did 15 year old boys.  I decided to put your faults behind us all, an give you another go.  At the suggestion of another customer, not you staff, I tried the trout.  Oh my goodness, that was pretty darn good.  Having caught a trout myself last week and cooking it, yours was better.  The beer temp fluctuated between 27. Something and 32 degrees.  I'm happy to see your beer temps did not fall too low, for too long, to separate the ingredients.  As the night went on, I almost enjoyed myself....until I discovered my siphoned wallet, but that is Vegas, not you.  Between here and the Phoenix location I've been to, I give you three peaks.  I almost gave you twin peaks, but you pulled pulled out some surprises like Total Recall to make it three peaks.",

    "text": "This is a place you come for the view and stay for the beer. The food is terrible. That said, my husband works nearby and has lunch often with coworkers. While the restaurant does have awesome strip views to people watch, that's not what I meant by view. I meant the smoking hot ladies. That's why the fellas keep comin' back even though the food is terrible.  I finally experienced it for myself before catching a concert at Cosmo. We came in for beers and shared the mozzarella sticks and nachos. The guys have tried most everything and declare these most edible. The nachos are huge. They're decent, but I didn't care for the sweet bbq sauce and the quality overall was pretty cheap. The mozzarella sticks were pretty good. I'd get them again. Lightly breaded thick gooey cheese and a decent marinara sauce for dipping. The real winner here is the beer. We all had the manly sized dirty blondes. It's served at 29-degrees and you'll get ice crystals your first few sips. Not all beer is good so cold, but this hits the spot.  The ladies weren't as friendly to me as to the guys I was with, but they know who their target audience is. They are well trained to part men with their money. I could do without the sales pitch for golf gear, tshirts and whatnot. Just bring my beer and make it quick. Unfortunately, the bartenders were painfully slow on my visit. Hopefully, that's not the norm.",

    "text": "Met some colleagues here.  I've actually never been to a Hooters, but my colleagues tell me the food here is better.  My priority was to get good beer, and this place delivered.  Their two house brews are both good.  They have a hefe (Dirty Blond) which was decent, but my favorite was the Naughty Brunette.  It's an amber and has some nice toasty notes.  The beers come in either a truly massive mug, or a very large, tall stein.  The smaller of the two must still be at least 20oz.  They also have a seasonal Sam Adams and Newcastle on tap, along with the usual crap beers (Bud/Miller type stuff).  Be aware that if you're a beer snob and don't like your beer cold to the point where the head is slushy, this is probably not a good place for you.  The food is typical for this type of place.  I got a grilled chipotle chicken dish that was good, if a little heavily seasoned.  Kind of a small piece of chicken, but the price was reasonable.  My companions reported that the Hangover burger was very good.  The salsa that came with the chips was also really good, with a smoky flavor.  The girls are everywhere at this place, and go out of their way to be friendly, to the point I found them slightly annoying.  We kept having our conversation interrupted by one scantily-clad server or another, trying to initiate idle chit chat.  Some guys may appreciate the attention, but as a married man, I could've done without.  The climbing wall is kind of a cool gimmick, and it's only $10 to try it.  They have 4 routes, but two are super short and should only be done by kids.  The other 2 have an overhanging section and it's fun to watch the drunken attempt to negotiate them.  The gimmick includes a \"race\" with your server, where you climb the wall and then your server climbs it and tries to beat your time.  Actually, they pretty much WILL beat your time, since it's clear they've climbed these routes many, many times.  My colleague, a very fit (and very inebriated) guy climbed the easier overhanging route in 2:34.  His server did it in 1:11, so be prepared to lose the wager your waitress will inevitably make with you.  Parking for locals is kind of a challenge.  There may be a better way to do it, but I parked in the Planet Hollywood Miracle Mile garage, then walked all the way through the Planet Hollywood to get to the restaurant.  All in all, this would be a fun place for a group of guys to go hang out and have good beer and good food.  The waitresses will definitely make sure you have a good time, and it's all good clean fun.  You can definitely do worse on the Strip, and this is a particularly good option if none of the bars/lounges in the Cosmopolitan are doing it for you (which they likely are not if you're reading reviews on Twin Peaks).",

You can tell that their employees enjoy working there & take pride in the service they provide. Quite refreshing if you ask me. OKay .. enough about processes & what-not.  Again, I gave up meat for Lent so I ordered the Chipotle Queso & Chips. It was yummy. We were checked on by several different waitresses to make sure everything was fine.

I finally had a chance to sample the food yesterday. Tried the Pulled Pork Nachos.  Nice size portion, however, very skimpy on the meat and cheese.  Also their barbecue sauce was way too cold & SWEET.  Only the nachos on the top were luke warm as I worked my way down they got colder and colder.  The cheese was cold and not melted at all.  I told the bartender I wasn't very happy with the food, so the manager came over and offered to remake them or take them off the bill. I chose the latter.  2 Stars for food, 3 for Customer Service",

The place is enormous - three stories with awesome TVs everywhere.  There is a rock climbing wall where you can occasionally catch a scantily-clad girl shimmying her way up.  There are tons of windows facing the strip.  There are side balconies and rooms for private parties.  All told, this place is great for watching a game, watching the strip, or just watching the staff.  To be fair, I did not have any food.  I only had some beer - their Blonde beer which is basically blue moon.  The taps have a temperature gauge on them to tell you how cold the beer is - proven by the mini icebergs floating in the mug.  The girl-size beer is a joke, dont even bother.  Our waitress was very pleasant.  She laughed and joked with us, and generally didnt seem phased that she was dressed like the trampy younger sister of Paul Bunyan.  Overall this place looks like it could be a lot of fun to catch a game.  The food smelled good, although strip-priced.  I'll definitely check this out again, probably when my dad is in town.  This is pretty much exactly where to take your dad when your mom is at the spa.",

We had unsuccessfully looked for breakfast and once I saw the girls at Twin Peaks, I told my bestie \"this is the place I told you about yesterday!\" She was a real trooper and agreed to go there. One of the waitresses, I wish I caught her name told me to try the Hangover Burger - she read my mind as I had spent the night prior drinking (hey it's Vegas) and needed to recover for another night of fun.   Our waitress, Natasha I believe - sorry I was a bit distracted :-) - was super awesome. She kept coming back to chat with us and we had some pretty amazing conversation, not to mention that she also pointed out some cool nightlife spots along the Strip. She was very attentive, brought our food out fast and made sure we were well taken care of. She was even nice enough to pose for a pic with me...a great birthday gift. :-) So if you're in town and go to Twin Peaks I highly recommend asking for Natasha, she's quite awesome...and beautiful. :-)  We were stuffed from the awesome meal but my only regret was not coming back to try the Blondie Brownie...it looked so good! Anyway Twin Peaks offered great food and great service making it for a very memorable birthday for me. I highly recommend dropping by and I will be back next time I'm in Vegas.",

They really, really should add some more variety to the menu. The pork nachos for example, why not have a chicken version? They do have chicken on the menu, so just makes no sense to me, i'm pretty sure people would order it. The pork nachos we had was $12 bucks and lacked a decent amount of pork, piled high with nachos and very , very messy to eat as the nachos keep falling off the tiny plate they serve it on. The burgers and fries are good. Overall a great place to get a beer, eat a burger and watch sports. They just really need to add a better variety of food to the menu. For an outdoor themed restaurant, with all the damn stuffed deer and moose heads mounted to the wall, they should at least offer a rib entree?. The price for the wings is way ridiculous, pretty much a $1 a wing, whatever.",

If you are looking for a menu with limited but great options this is a great start here. When you go out especially in this town more time than not you are lost in the shuffle with average service at best and an overwhelming menu. They do it right here with meals made from scratch, great service from the management on down to the staff. This is a great place with multiple levels and areas to watch your sports team with the sound on and get treated like a champ. Mona is one of the managers and she is top notch across the board and the whole staff makes you feel like you are truly at home in the big pond known as Las Vegas. I cannot say enough about the variety of drinks, many different seating areas inside and outside, and the quality of the food. A great addition to the strip check it out and you won't be disappointed.",

I ordered the Hangover Burger and after waiting 30 minutes for it, I was shocked at what they brought to my table. The patty (if you can call it that) was as thin as the coasters, as a matter of fact I think that the McDonald's crap patties were thicker. To top it off, the patty wasn't complete it literally seemed as if someone took a bite out of it. How could the cook even put that out to a paying customer? The egg it comes with was bad. The lettuce was wilted and the size of a silver dollar. Really? The worst part was when we asked our very nice waitress Brenda called over a manager and when I explained to him the situation he stupidly responded, \"so you don't want the burger because it's missing a piece?\" Wow. Me and the wife just paid for our one beer, one margarita, and one chx tenders appetizer (total $37) and left.  Never again.",

The food is good but not great for the money, i had fish tacos and they were tasty but not anything i would go through the hassle of parking, walking, and getting to this place to have again. I sat at the bar up stairs on the 3rd floor to watch some World Cup action. Lots of tv's and really glad they play the sound over the speakers to follow the announcers. The bar tender (i wish i remembered her name) was super sweet, and attentive with drinks and the food. I think if your looking for a place to check out the ladies working, and on the strip to watch a game then sure... this may be right up your alley. If your like me who likes a good bite (maybe a little less expensive, drinks) and just wants to watch some soccer action, a pub might be better for you. We had 2 fish taco plates, 3 beers, and a 7&7 and my bill was in the low $80's not exactly a budget lunch but to the right person they might not mind paying for the atmosphere.",

She was obviously inexperienced and this might be why she had no clue that people like me tip 20-30%. Oh well. The drinks were decent (the one round we got). The food was CRAP. We were stuck there for almost an hour for a couple bad sandwiches and one round because we were ignored. We had plenty of time to look around and found that this place will not last very long. The waitresses are not that good looking. Half of them were just in bras and no uniform. And if you call a place twin peaks, you expect to see something. Nope. The person doing the hiring must be a member of the itty bitty **tty club because there was nothing but skinning girls with no figure and a bunch of piercings to look at.

Very fun spot to belly up to the bar, people watch and then try your hand at the wall. Food is OK- lots of fried bar food as to be expected but a surprisingly good cobb salad. Love that the large beer size is called \"the man size\"- probably dissuades dudes from ordering anything but! Luckily, they had smaller female sizes for me. Clientele is about 90% male tourists (probably because of the location on the strip next to the Goratorium and because all the staff I saw was female, gorgeous, about 21 and scantily clad.

At the bar by the entrance, the bartender there like whoa: poster model of what Twins Peaks should represent. When we were taken to the second floor of the restaurant, there were a number of waitresses walking around, nothing like the one by entrance though. After we were taken to our table, nothing but tumbleweeds. 20+ minutes no one came to tend to our table so we left. What was the tipping point was after 15-20 minutes, a group of two sat at the table next to us and were served immediately. Never in my time dining have I waited over 20 minutes and not even been tended to. Unacceptable and bye Felecia",

It fluctuated between about 28 and 30 degrees, but really - why would you order beer above 29 degrees given the choice?

The beer was ice cold and came from their micro brewery.  I also had a bloody mary and it was so delicious my friends also had one.  The staff was friendly and very attentive.

Our server was Lauren and she was very nice and made sure our glasses were kept full! We really enjoy places that have small menus, then you know your food is going to be done properly as they don't have hundreds of things to throw them off! The burgers sounded amazing, lots of flavor going on. But this time we got the queso and chips to start with, then we saw the nachos go by and thought WOW, we gotta try those next time. They were a mini mountain! The chips and queso were great, love the thin chips and the salsa mixed into the queso was a fantastic flavor! Hubby had chicken fried steak, I had the steak sliders, our friend had the philly cheesesteak. Everything was cooked perfectly and we cleaned our plates! In the end I would say this is a great place to stop in with friends and enjoy some good food and great ice cold beer it is 29 degrees! My hubby loved the cold cold beer! So try it out and be sure to ask for Lauren she was so fun and helpful!",

I mean, it's a Twin Peaks. I didn't expect it to be amazing, and it wasn't terrible. I probably wouldn't come back for the food. I would come back just for the experience and the fact that it doesn't hurt to pay the prices.  I got a margarita. It was strong, and it was delicious.

Working at a Twin Peaks I know what to expect and I was disappointed. We were sat on the 1st floor by an outstanding hostess named HUNTER and she is the only reason we went back the following night. After being sat we waited to be greeted for at least 5 minutes, our server comes over and looked apathetic and got our drink orders. My friend and I ordered waters and an appetizer to share because we had arrived w our alcoholic beverages. Felt like she prejudged us for being cheap and didn't come back for like 30 minutes. During checkout I told her I work at a twin and her whole mood switched, suddenly she had a lot to say. I tipped both girls genuinely as I understand the hustle, even though service wasn't great. We left and thanked Hunter for being so nice bc she came to our table and had a conversation with us.   The following night we came and sat on the 3rd floor which had a beautiful view of the strip. Again our server got drink orders and same thing but she was a little more attentive. They remembered me from the night before and so there was some conversation. Overall HUNTER is a great worker and has the best attitude out of all the girls we saw. She definitely deserves a promotion and I see her being a very great bartender in the future!!! She's great for the Twin Peaks Brand!! Go Hunter! Thank you girl :)",

He has been to the Twin Peaks location in Chicago before, so of course he had to take me to their Las Vegas location while we were in town. We went around lunchtime on a Sunday and it was busy, but not too busy. We were easily about to get seats at a table in the bar area.  Our server was good, but not very nice or friendly. She kept the drinks coming, but always had a scowl on her face and kept standing at the back of the restaurant with her arms crossed. Not very fun! Some of the other girls had the same attitude, but there were a few good ones.  They have a rock climbing wall inside which I thought was fun to watch. One of the customers and one of the servers decided to climb the wall as we were sitting there and it was fun cheering them on!  We didn't have anything to eat while we were there, but I had their Twin Peaks Dirty Blonde Beer in \"Girl Size\" and I actually thought it was pretty good. Nice and light and had a good flavor! My Husband on the other hand had a few \"Angry Balls\" shots which he really enjoyed.  They have a ton of TVs around the bar showing all different kinds of sports programs which I thought was a great idea because you could always be assured to be able to see the game you wanted to watch. I would come back here next time I'm in Las Vegas or at one of their other locations.",

Well, normally I would agree, but after 2 days of spending lots of money and walking all up and down the strip, we just needed half a day just to relax.   We walked into Twin Peaks around noon on a Sunday and it was pretty sparse as to be expected on a Sunday without football. That worked out great since our waitress sat us down in a booth, giving us ample room for our drinks (those bigass 32 oz. icy mugs) and get our draft going.   The food at Twin Peaks is as you would expect, pretty solid sports bar food (I went with the wings). Our Waitress Andrea was awesome, she had a great sense of humor and came back frequently to check on our drinks and any requests we had.   If you are like us and you just need a place to relax for a bit or are a bit turned off at all the other expensive options for hosting your fantasy football draft, just try out Twin Peaks. Sometimes familiarity can be a good thing.",

I guess my expectations were very high. Their beers continues to be nice and cold which I really enjoyed.",

They were having a twin peaks bikini contest last night & my bestie was in it, so I decided to come support!   Upon entering you had to pay 10$ to go upstairs for the bikini contest, fortunately I was put on the list so I got in for free. Yay! Twin peaks is a pretty large establishment. 3 stories and by far the top floor is the best. It has the greatest view especially at night. The first floor has a rock claiming wall where you can have some drunken fun.   This place was the place to be when it first opened. All the girls were friendly, knowledgable, fun, & on fire! Last night I had a few different servers due to my table hopping. Our first server was extremely nice & checked up on us constantly to make sure we were doing alright. I asked for prices on drinks & she had no clue of it & was just guessing the prices. Other than that she was a doll.  Now, other server wasn't too nice. Her demeanor wasn't to great. She didn't look like she wanted to be there at all. She took forever to bring drinks. Even longer to check up on you. She would cut you off when you tried to tell her things. Not a good look.  Atmosphere is very laid back and fun at twin peaks. Probably will return when I need to for friends, but randomly coming in to eat here, probably won't happen.",

    "text": "Umm it's gonna be an absolute NO for me! Twin Peaks is awful to say the least... I really was so disappointed with my most recent first visit with friends this weekend. When we arrived first of all there was not a person in sight at the door welcoming or even directing where you can go to be helped. My friends and I decided to head up the stairs and just so happened to run into one of the waitresses who said we could sit wherever we wanted and that somebody would be right with us. Direction as followed we were eventually greeted by a waitress who took our drink orders and then disappeared... About 15 minutes later she showed back up with our waters and took the first order which was the mozzarella cheese bites as an appetizer.   After placing this order about 20 minutes later the appetizer came out and we then placed our order for the 18pc lemon pepper wings with a side of French fries.. It took no lie about 45 minutes for them to arrive. To my terrible surprise, as I took my fork to scoop fries onto my plate there was a long piece of black hair that came out right along with the fries attached to one of the pieces of chicken! Yuck! .. Just great.. At this point everybody was extremely frustrated and the fact that these wings came out with hair on them they weren't even hot. You can tell that they had been sitting and clearly weren't fresh.   I mean c'mon now if you are going to have people wait that long for their food at least bring it out piping fresh. I was extremely disappointed with the lack of care from the waitress because when we brought this to her attention she was super nonchalant about the whole situation and just shrugged it off like \" oh well this happens all the time\" kind of attitude.. With that being said we paid for the cheese bites and left as fast as we could... this was crazy and so unexpected because I actually had a great experience in one of their locations in Atlanta, GA and sad to say that my own city couldn't even deliver just as well....",

It's located in a strip mall type set up right next to Planet Hollywood. Once you walk in it's super gimmicky with all the girls dressed in basically a stripper meets a lumberjack type outfit. Can't forget the rock climbing wall either.   I first got a bad impression after we told the hostess we wanted to sit upstairs and she decided to sit us downstairs in a back corner. Why even ask if you don't take our request? My next bad impression came from the hot salsa that was served with our chips. I've never once in my life had hot salsa and I'm talking temperature hot, not spicy. We asked our waitress if we could get some chilled salsa or just room temp which she said wasn't possible. I'm pretty sure they had to heat it up in the first place so I don't understand why they couldn't cool it down.   The only thing semi decent about this place was the veggie burger, but other than that I would never come back here. Go someone else for the price that's worth it.",

    "text": "I came here for dinner, but left frustrated, hungry, and disappointed with the service. I never received my dinner and the \"courtesy solution\" was to comp my beer. As a result, full disclosure, this review is being hastily written by a very hangry patron who still hasn't eaten.   From the start, I could tell service was a bit lax. My bachelor party of five arrived for a late evening grub around 9:00, so it wasn't busy by any means, and we were promptly seated on the 3rd floor.  Unfortunately, the slow service was undeniably apparent after waiting 14 minutes for our beers. Our generous waiter offered to put in appetizers while we waited for our simple drink order, but I pondered why it would take a bartender so long to sling 5 simple drinks. The reason became distinctly obvious when I observed three of the wait staff leaning over the railings chatting up about their day.   The slow service continued as we waited over thirty minutes to receive our food order. Unfortunately for me, I was apparently not privvied to receive dinner tonight. Assuming she simply had to go grab my meal, I continued to wait patiently until she returned about 12 minutes later. She asked how things were going, so I politely, yet sarcastically, mentioned that I couldn't judge how the food was since I never received my meal.  This is where the first frustration occurred, when she asked \"oh, wait, what did you have again?\"... \"Seriously\" I thought to myself... At this point with my friends having eaten nearly their entire meal, I asked her to not bother bringing a meal to the table and just comp the order. Of course she had to check with her manager instead of resolving the problem on the spot.   She first came back saying she would comp the beer. I reminded her that as best man, I have been paying for the groom as well, and I don't expect to pay for services we didn't satisfactorily receive.  She happily came back and said she would comp his meal as well. Yet, as she was going around the table with checks, she gave the groom a check to pay for his drink and for half the appetizer the other three had, despite agreeing to comp it. Extremely annoyed at the sheer lack of human decency and complete absence of customer service resolution at this point, I annoyingly grabbed the check and paid for it.  In reality, I have no problem paying for the meal and drinks. My problem is with the service and the way the issue was handled. A manager never came over to check on things or offer restitution, and as a customer sitting down at an eating establishment, I wasn't offered any alternative food solution like take out. Despite the positive comments about the food, I'm not sure I can come back here with the slow service and lack of problem resolution.",

They forgot about me. My food took 50 minutes and I had to ask if it was ready then came cold. It's a time filler job for the employees before they go host night clubs. They just climb a wall and talk in the corner together forgetting the guests. Absolutely horrible. And I normally never would post a bad thing only good.",

    "text": "I've often passed by Twin Peaks during my annual trips to Las Vegas but never stopped in for a bite or a drink until this past January 2018.  I was meeting someone and we wanted to decide where to go. He mentioned he didn't want any place really fancy. We also wanted some place on the Strip. It was my first evening in Las Vegas and I normally stop by Shake Shack and In-N-Out at least once during any trip to Las Vegas so those were two of my suggestions along with FatBurger. He mentioned Twin Peaks and asked if I've ever been there. I mentioned that I've never been there BUT I was familiar with the type of place (Hooters type place) and was fine with it in terms of food options and location.  We met inside Planet Hollywood Casino and walked over to Twin Peaks. Upon entering, the place was relatively busy so if we wanted a table, we would have to wait. We decided to eat/drink at the bar. We walked around and found 2 bar stools so we sat down.  We were provided with a menu which I quickly looked at and decided what I wanted. One of the hostesses (but not the \"main\" hostess who served us for the remainder of the evening) asked us if we wanted something to drink. I opted for a large Coors. My friend had a beer as well but decided not to order a large since you told me that he would probably have problems finishing it. She asked us if we wanted a tab and my friend said yes so I also said yes. She asked us for a credit card. Since we were paying separately, we both gave our credit cards. When she returned less than 1 minute later, she gave us our credit cards and put a bill/paper into each of the glasses in front of us.   Our hostess (Nicole) then showed up and brought our beer. We asked if we could order the food now and she took our orders. I don't remember what my friend ordered but I decided to go with the fish and chips. After Nicole took our orders, my friend told me that service would probably be slow. Surprisingly, we didn't have to wait too long for our food orders.  I liked my fish and chips and decided to have another large Coors. The first thing I have to say about the beer is that it is ice cold. It is the coldest draft beer that I've ever had. I mean, there were ice crystals in the beer and even though it wasn't hot outside (after all, it was January in the evening), it really hit the spot. Nicole was very friendly and nice. She also dropped by during our meal and asked if everything was okay with our order.  The hostesses around the bar (including Nicole) were wearing bikinis, winter boots, and some type of fur hats. I'm not sure if this is the standard attire but based on the show \"Undercover Boss\", I was expecting the \"lumberjack\" motif/style.  After finishing, we decided to pay and leave. I decided to pay with cash whereas my friend decided to pay with his credit card that he had used with his tab. He asked Nicole if she needed his card again and she mentioned that it wasn't necessary.  I would have no problems returning here... although 2 days later after we ate at a burger place, my friend did ask me if I wanted to drop by here again for a drink and I mentioned no since I was full and wasn't feeling at 100% during my vacation.",

I mean below freezing so it's nice and frosty on a 110 degree day. House brews too. Lots of high quality HD TVs with tons of sports. A great view of the south strip. A rock climbing wall. Actually really good food. (Especially compared to any similar type of chain) And best of all, some of the sweetest and most beautiful women you have ever met. Today I'm at the bar and both Celeste and Nicoley have been great. Always on point, always smiling and the best service in town.",

We also asked that my companion's veggie burger had the sundried tomatoes on the side. When I got my burger, my beef patty was pink all the way through. The waitress took it back and brought a new on after around 15 mins. She also forgot the sundried tomatoes on the side.  Overall the burger was average and the fries were warm only. It also took forever to get the bill. Will not return to this restaurant.",

This location feels like you're in a cave, tucked into a corner, with very little light coming in, but we found the food to be excellent. I had Chicken Fried Chicken served over Mashed Potatoes and a Grilled Vegetable Mix that was really good! The Chicken and Waffles (topped with two fried eggs) also looked very good. The usual 29 degree Dirty Blonde and Naughty Brunette washed everything down nicely!  And next to many of restaurants serving similar-style food, the prices weren't bad either.

Now speaking of service, we had one girl who basically took our orders and stuff, but said that someone else was our server. About 10 minutes later, our real server came and since we were already taken care of by the other girl, I felt like it should've just been her who received this table as hers and receive the tips... But anyhow, our server wasn't as interactive as I thought she would be... Reason for saying this is because if you want good tip, just bullshit something or say something and chill a little bit... Whistle while you work... She checked up on us about 3-5 times about how we were doing and just awkwardly but quickly left after saying anything to us. When we were finally leaving was when she actually stayed and laugh a little with us... So ehhh, might try this place again, might not.",

So now is the second time i went I brought my fiance .  the menu is very limited but we saw something that said \"chicken fried steak or chicken\"  I assumed... Due to the conjunction.. It was just a regular chicken breast.. So when it was brought out/ it was fried as well.  I told the server I thought it wasn't fried. Because of the wording on the menu And her friend came over with a menu and showed me to my face how it's fried  Then both the girls went to my fiance trying to talk him into just eating it when really I'm the one who had the problem   Bottom line.. You don't go there for the food. Or the service .",

My friend has a serious crazing for mozzarella sticks so we figured they would have them here. These were hands down the best mozzarella bites I have EVER had. Lightly deep fried, and bursting with cheese.  Dip that in the side marinera sauce and it's a party in your mouth. Unfortunately I didn't enjoy my meal as much as the appetizer. I can't remember the name but it was chicken breast topped with black bean and corn, mashed potatoes and side veggies. The chicken was decent nothing I would order again but the mashed potatoes needed some milk and butter they were bland and the side veggies were zucchini which is probably one of the only vegetables I don't like. My friends ordered a steak sandwich and a burger. I wish I went the sandwich route as well. Because they looked good.",

Food 1 star: Food was literally disgusting, sorry to say that I never like the term but someone in the back has to review the recipes. Got a fried chicken steak that was the size of 2 plates. Was extremely thin and over fried, I woke up this morning with a stomach ache for having eaten 3 bites, tasted burned and not meat flavor. The mashed potatoes were on the button of it and I couldn't get to it because was cover from that giant thing. My gf got chicken tender and she said said thing weren't good. They were pale and soggy from oil so she ate only the fries.  Service 3 star: The girls at the bar were nice but a little inattentive. I didn't order extra beer just because no one asked me if I wanted more after I finished. I tried to get their attention, got pissed after waving several times so in the end when they finally came over I just asked for the bill, I didn't wanna take the chance to spend another 15 min just for the check. The girls seemed busy but the bar twas half empty. If I come back will be no food and not very often",

Great people watching in their open-air patio overlooking the strip on the 3rd floor. They do an amazing job keeping that cool in the summer and warm in the winter.   And if you're coming for the scantily-clad waitstaff, there's something for everyone (unless you like men, sorry). Variety of sizes, shapes, races, hairstyles, piercings, tats, etc. They are generally friendly, though service can be hit-or-miss.  Haven't figured out the climbing wall, but apparently racing a waitress up the wall is a thing.   Would love to give 4* since it's such a comfortable environment. This is a pretty harsh 3, but it's not quite a 4.",

The cover for the event was that you have to purchase a minimum of $30 per person in food/ drinks. I loved that because it makes sense & ended up spending $50 myself, not including tip.   The second time they charged $35 at the door, not including food/ drinks. That may be normal for most places, but it's BS & the only reason I came back was because I had liked their process before. So this time, I barely ordered anything & will not be coming back for the fights.   They said the process changes based on the fight card. However, PPV prices don't change, so...? No thanks.   Outside of that gripe, it's not better or worse than any other chain restaurant I've been to out here. The servers are great though.",

We both are avid MMA fans so we asked the concierge for the best place to watch the fights. He quickly suggested Twin Peaks...without knowing what to expect, we headed over. The place was packed but it was obvious the manager knows how to staff his shift. There plenty of stunning waitresses buzzing around, quickly attending everyone's needs. The wood lodge decor gave a friendly feel...and wall to wall big screen TV's make for a great sports viewing experience.   Food and beer (ICE cold!) selection...EXCELLENT! We were both pleasantly surprised with the quality of the food and prompt service! Everything we nibbled on was tasty...I can't wait to try the other entrees!    Staff...hubba hubba lol Pretty girls with friendly smiles...that aside, the prompt service was icing on the cake. I would be remiss not to mention one person in particular...our bartender Sara(h?)!!! OMG she was an absolute doll!!! Talk about service with a smile! Super friendly and kept our glasses full. Our friend showed up late, but she managed to squeeze him in so we could watch the fights together...she didn't have to do that, but she went out of her way to make us happy. Honestly, If not for our dinner reservations, we probably would have stayed there all night! I can't thank Twin Peaks enough for helping to make such a memorable bday evening!   We found our new \"go to\" sports bar next time we visit Las Vegas...Twin Peaks!!!",

I've been here before but never got the chance to write a review, so here I go:  For starters, this place is located inside of a \"Mall\" area if I may say?. Sports bar with lots of TV's. Loads of beautiful women. Their beer is advertised to be served at 29 degrees if I'm not mistaken, which is the best! Their beer is served in mugs and they come real cold and icy. They have this temperature-board that let's you know how cold they're serving their beer at. Oh! Can't forget the rock-climbing wall they have indoor as well. They also have an additional upper floor you're more than welcome to hang out at.   I haven't tried their food, so my review is based off of the beer selections. Will have to update once I try their food.  If you're a fan of icy cold beer, then this is your spot! If I had a man cave, this place would be it!",

Sat in the top level with a view of TVs and the strip. A waitress named Jenna came over and took my order. Beer was served almost immediately. I ordered wings and calamari. They were served about halfway through my beer and both were excellent. A large portion of calamari and it was nice to see the wings were the premium, large ones. Was at a different place the night before and it seemed those wings were from quail. The wings at Twin Peaks were 3 or 4 bites each. I ordered breaded and they were crispy, the chicken hot and juicy. Some of the best wings I've had. Jenna stopped by regularly to make sure everything was satisfactory and during the few lulls, stayed to chat for a few minutes. Being there myself, it was very much appreciated she took time to be friendly. She seems to be a genuinely sweet and considerate person. Most important though, she was an outstanding waitress. Checked to make sure the food was good, stopped by to refill water when it was low, asked if I'd like another beer when that got low and was able to hold interesting conversations when she wasn't running around taking care of other tables. I'll be back in town in a couple weeks and will definitely be going back to Twin Peaks.",

    "text": "Looking to catch a few games, sip some drinks and enjoy the \"bubbly\" servers. Then Twin Peaks is for you.   The food is pretty decent for a sports bar on the Strip and the price is right. I was here with about five dudes. We all shared plates of food and Boneless wings, bone-in wings, fried pickles and a massive plate of chicken Nachos. The nachos were the star of the show. A sports bar classic; crispy chips, shredded chicken, salsa, jalapenos, and guacamole. A great order for the table. The fried pickles were good to, but just a tad salty. Definitely deep these in some ranch.   The boneless wings were my jam. I'm not a bone-in wing guy. So these large chunk of chicken hit the spot. We got the Spicy Thai, Nashville hot, and the Garlic Parmesan. The garlic parm was great and a shout out to the spicy Thai sauce!   Out server, Brittany?, was very attentive and checked on us frequently. A quick tip, During UFC fights they charge an extra $10 just to sit at the bar or in the restaurant. Beers, bros, and bewbs. Not a bad little Saturday.",

    "text": "While this rating entails my experience post-food & beverages, it is extremely important nonetheless.   After eating and drinking at a tall table in the bar, our party of four settled the checks and continued our adventure down the Vegas strip. After several minutes of walking, we realized we left our bag of souvenir T-shirt's at the table and headed back to the restaurant.  My husband asked the gentleman at the host desk (not sure if he was the host or not) if he had seen a bag left behind or if a busser found a bag while cleaning. The gentlemen repeatedly said no, despite my husband describing the store it was purchased from, the bag description, and what was in the bag. Luckily, a busser was nearby, so my husband decided to ask her about the bag- which she kindly pointed out was just brought up to the front desk...where the guy, who declined seeing the bag, was standing. Smh. Unapologetically, he handed the bag to my husband.   To be clear- I accept full responsibility for leaving my belongings ANYWHERE. If I had lost my souvenirs because I left them, and another patron took them- that's no ones fault but my own. However, when I have to question the integrity of the employees of the businesses  I visit...that's just ridiculous.",

I had a few beers (Stella) which were frosty cold and to eat I had there selected their  BLT which was just great. Michelle was my bartender /server and she was fast, friendly and awesome all night.    I was enjoying my evening so much I stayed for a w hile to watch the Dodgers game and I must give Props to the manager (I didn't get his name) but he changed some channels so I could watch my Dodgers. The entire staff was very friendly and I will be back again the next time I'm in town.    Great Job!!",

Las Vegas is a completely different market than any other place on the planet. Happy employees are very productive employees. Manager Scott is the only sane one there because he is the only original one left. I'm going to follow the original staff at their new places and tip them even more than previously at Twin peaks. 1 star is extremely generous because there is no lower score to submit. Good Luck Twin Peaks on the Vegas strip. You'll be out of biz before you know it because of cooperate stupidity. Very Unhappy Long Time Patron",

She sat us in her section, recommended some bomb flavors for wings and even sat down for a little chat. The food was hella good and I would definitely go back sober to eat! Food came out quick but not like a \"did they microwave this?\" quick. Conversation was so easy! And she even showed us pics of her adorable ass daughter.

The location has nothing to do with the TV series/movie. You can use your imagination as to why it's called Twin Peaks. Women servers are dressed in lingerie and stocking and serve you. Basically a Hooters with lingerie.  Food: Nope! Not good. I had something simple that they are supposedly  known for. Hamburger! I believe that if you can eat the meat patty by itself and it's good, then it's a good burger. I tried a bite of just the meat and it was NOT good. Dress it up however you want, it's still not a good burger. (I had the guacamole burger)  Drinks: $20 for 5 domestics. I guess that's okay.  Silly me fell for it..the gimmick. They have a lady selling shots near the hostess stand. All sorts of flavors. I picked one and basically it was water. Wasted money. Next time maybe I will ask for a fresh pour. They also have a barbers chair where you can sit and they will spin you around after getting a shot. Some did this but I was not about to try that.  If nothing else, at least try this once and see what you think.  Visited the location about a month+ ago.",

Well I have to say, Adam was great, such a friendly, caring GM and Josh the other Manager was wonderful. Both came over to our table to say hello and to make sure we were enjoying our dinner.  Our waitress Jenny was terrific, she is a great waitress, and makes sure you are enjoying your dinner. She was very attentive. Adam and Josh are the way managers should be, they are concerned and care that each and every customer enjoys themselves which we did.  Thank you Adam and Josh and Jenny.   Just a note...... Scott the GM at the Henderson store would do well to follow the example of how a manager should run a restaurant, which he has no skills in doing.  So when you want great food, great service and a great management team dine at the Strip location.  Want bad service, terrible food, and Scott the GM with the attitude go to the Henderson location.",

They did have three of their own draft beers, a Blonde, Red, and Brown Ale...oh...I get it now lol!  I had the red ale...it was good, but nothing to brag about.  It did come in an ice cold mug which was perfect for that 100+ degree day.    The best part was the rock climbing wall.  It's free and all you have to do is sign a waiver.

Twin Peaks fit the bill completely!!!  This place is several levels, and the first floor was busy, but we really wanted to be upstairs with the view. We were sat at a long table near the windows, as we wished it was just a little less cold so we could enjoy the balcony. Even with heaters the balcony was just to cold on the night of our visit.  Service was ok, our server was good but not overly friendly, and maybe on the new side, because sometimes you can just tell when a server is still learning the ropes. She didnt have control of our needs, but I did. She did the job and think she will be great after a few more shifts.  Big positives where Prices and Specials!!! If you want to get away from Mall or Casino prices come here. We had $6 Bloody Mary's and 22 ounce premium beers. I think Jack and Tito's were also on special for 6 bucks and they have a nice selection of $5 shots. Do ask about drink specials!!!!  We also wanted something to snack on so we ordered the Nachos with Steak $16.00 (the most expencive appetizer) and they were well worth it. a half sheet pan piled with chips, beans, cheese, tomatoes, guacamole, jalapenos, sour cream and plenty of diced steak. I know twin peaks has a reputation for great food and these Nachos did not disappoint.  I will always make this place a stop when in Vegas, you should too!",

I guess anyone can climb it if they feel like it, we saw several people doing it. Different form of entertainment.  The waitress wear the minimum clothing requirement (which hubby loved of course).  Its got a lot of TV's for the sports fans and food was actually fresh and decent, although I think a bit pricey for a burger joint.",

My wife and I went here last night, we sat down and after 10 minutes we were never greeted, but you see all these waitresses gossiping and laughing between them, so we decide to get up & leave. I forgot my phone so we had to come back and the manager comes rushing down says, have you eaten already so we said no and then he says come on in, practically dragging us inside for what happend, we went ahead and ordered, we eat, got the bill and they charged us what we ordered. Believe me, is not about the money, we were under the impression that the manager was going to comp our check or a least gives us a discount for the inconvenience but we were wrong LOL. I end up paying the full amount. We defenatelly will never return to this twin peaks and any other twin peaks. Worst experience ever, I have been wanting to go to one of these places for the longest time and it really didn't meet our expectations at all, I don't have a doubt that this place won't last long.",

    "text": "We had a recommendation from a friend to go there when in Las Vegas. We love beer and the list was impressive (and we are from \"beervana\" in the Northwest).  However, the negatives outweighed the positives:  1. Volume on the speaker above our table for the football game was at airplane-takeoff decibel levels and didn't appear to be adjustable.  2. When our 2 beers arrived, the server gal had 3 beers in her hands and was confused about which might be our two, as all pretty much looked alike. So, we will never know what it was we were actually drinking.  3. Our waitress was prompt in taking our order and we were very specific that my husband wanted NO ONIONS on his burger. She understood and repeated it and appeared to comprehend it just fine. However, when the burgers arrived, his had the carmelized onions on it (which blend in with the melted cheese, so you can't just pick them off without removing all of the cheese). Luckily, I stopped him from taking a bite as he is allergic to onions. The waitress should have checked to see that she was picking up the correct order (same as with the beer, but that was a different gal), or that the kitchen had actually made a burger without the carmelized onions. He sent it back and decided he would eat elsewhere rather than chance what would come out of the kitchen.  My burger was delicious - but I'm not allergic to onions.  They were gracious about not charging for the burger mistake, and all of the servers were upbeat and cheery, but we won't be going back.",

The hostess told us if we states for the fight we'd have to pay a $15.00 cover ( soooo Vegas). We didn't stay nor did we plan to stay. I had the quesadillas and enjoyed then because they came with a blk bean pico de gallo and were seasoned well. It's an app not an entree but it was more than enough for me. My husband had the fish tacos which he liked. Not sure what kind of fish or was but he liked them. I felt like it took a whole for the food to come out but inguessvthat means they somewhat actually cooked it. The women's bathroom was clean and had 3 options for drying your hands.

    "text": "I'd like to give it more than 3 stars but...  We ended up going to Twin Peaks twice in our recent stay in Las Vegas (the first to watch the Tigers and have a few beers before we went to play in a poker tournament, I came in 2nd in that one :) the second at the end of a late night).    I've described the bar to a friend as \"Hooters except Awesome\".    The positives:  The bar has a number of TV screens on each side of the bar that you should be able to catch a game that interests you (in addition one screen plays an internal channel that shows various funny \"catch on tape\" incidents as well as various profiles of attractive Twin Peaks girls in-between).  The beer is advertised as coming out below freezing (with a nice little electronic sign showing the temperature that the beer is coming out at) which worked well.  Considering that the attraction is pretty much T&A I have to say that the bartenders we had each night were very, very good with the customer service.  In addition, craft beer fans, the company apparently makes at least 2 of its own beers, which are choices (\"The Dirty Blonde\" which is like a Summer or Hefe, and the \"Naughty Brunette\" which is a darker beer, I liked the darker better).  Also, its kind of neat but they do have rock climbing walls on one side of the bar and you can have Twin Peaks girls cheering you on as you climb (no, I've never climbed them, still thought it worth mentioning)  The negatives:  $10 a beer?  Serious sticker shock.  I can't tell you about the food as we used this as a sports bar to watch the Tigers and have a good time at either the beginning or the end of the night.  I'm giving it 4 stars because I apparently can't rate it 3.5 and its a better time than 3 stars.  Would I go again?  Yeah, because this is a pretty good place to watch sports in Las Vegas and this was actually the second best time I had as a nightspot on my vacation.  This place is located on the recent upper level construction that is on the side of Planet Hollywood with the Evening Call, Bubba Gump Shrimp, Eli Roth's haunted house along with others and is not (as far as I know) accessible from inside the Casino itself.  I thought I'd add that as many reviews are not super specific on its location.",

Just super rude. I order a beer later and she comes back and drops it off to him and says here's ur Coors light like no u dumb broad I ordered it from u, like hello, stupid ain't a good look. Then another server comes by to ask if he's doing ok if he'd like a water, by this time I'm irritated like fall back. It's just super disrespectful. I don't mind gawking girls, just have enough respect to acknowledge his girl too so it's less obvious u trying to cross a line",

All the girls are super friendly and fun (we had Nicoley-olie and Ashley as our bartenders) and may I mention very beautiful and not stuck up at all. Drank the Dirty Blonde and (lots) of fireball and ate the chips with some sort of queso sauce and it was AMAZING. I heard the rest of the food is great as well, but only had the appetizer. Loved the rock climbing wall.. provides lots of entertainment. Will definitely be back on my next Vegas trip.",

The price wasn't bad and the view of the strip was perfectly scenic. I got the fish tacos grilled (choice of fried, grilled, or blackened) and it tasted very light and fresh. Wife got the burger and it tasted great as well with good crispy fried.  Ultimately still very chain-like and basic options for food but I really had a good time and pleasant experience here.

They know what they're doing and how to get big tips from those guys though! It's 3 stories tall which is pretty cool, the view from the top floor overlooking the strip is pretty awesome actually. They also have a random rock climbing wall in the center of the place. Beer is priced sky-high for the \"man-sized\" mug (that's how they get these fools to pay more, because they wouldnt want to order the smaller, less expensive size if it's called \"girl-sized). They also serve the beer on top at 29 degrees or something which is pretty awesome, You get a hint of a beer slushy at the beginning.  This would be a great place to have a drink, watch the game, and hang out with friends... If not for the over the top (not in a good way) service.",

You aren't going to find $25 gourmet burgers here.  If you want that, go see Ramsay.  If you want some good old fashioned handmade American pub fare, this is the place for you.  Over a few visits, we tried many items on the menu and they were all excellent.  I would highly recommend starting with the mozzarella sticks.  They are huge and tasty.  Follow that up with the hangover burger and compliment with a man-sized ice cold dirty blonde to wash it down.  You won't be disappointed.  There are ton's of TV's showing everything from ESPN to stupid man blunders.  You probably won't spend much time watching them though.  There is a rock wall that I highly recommend sitting in view of if possible.  Watching patrons try to climb it is a whole new level of entertainment.  The girls climb it quite often as well which can be equally as entertaining.  One of the girls, I think her name is Raven, is a machine on that wall and will put the hot-shot men to shame.  Pure awesomeness!  Remember everything is over-priced on the strip.  TP is no exception.  Everything is about $2 more than at a TP elsewhere.  It's nowhere near as out of control as many other places where the food and atmosphere are nowhere near as good.",

Next day was a college football Saturday. Girls looked cute in their (abbreviated) favorite team jerseys. When I was informed Sierra wasn't working at the time I decided to sit at the 3rd floor bar. Good choice, awesome view of the Strip. Fun atmosphere with all the key games on TV. Although it was quite busy received great service from bartenders Megan and Ellen. Chatted with a couple of the regulars and downed several of the Dirty Blonds.  Both visits were a big improvement from my May visit. Just goes to show, a lot of the make/break of a visit comes down to your server or bartender. Definitely looking forward to stopping by my next time in Vegas.  And bonus for me, as I'm walking out the entrance who's \"manning\" the beer tub but Sierra! Way too many beers in me at that point but got to chat briefly.",

Little snotty girls that couldn't care less about providing prompt, good service.  Asked three times to have the Nationals game put on the TV and all three times we were basically ignored.  Left after one drink...and it took about ten mins to even get that one drink.  Come to find out after going to another place close by that is the reputation of twin peaks with the other establishments in the area.  Do not go there unless you don't care about being treated like crap and provided poor service!  Not even worth one star!!",

    "text": "I want to meet the red-blooded American who can give Twin Peaks less than 5 stars?!?!  I already had high expectations because some friends had been here shortly after opening and the group of guys had a blast.  Personally, I've never been a fan of the gimmicky-restaurant (Hard Rock, Planet Hollywood, Hooters, etc), so I wasn't expecting more than gratuitous T&A with barely-edible food.  I'd much rather go to a hole-in-the-wall dive that has great food and great service.     But then there's Twin Peaks...  We went today for lunch and had a little trouble finding the restaurant...at least the parking.  Twin Peaks is located on the 2nd floor of a building on Harmon & Las Vegas Blvd - right across from Aria.  We ended up parking in Planet Hollywood Casino and walking over.  Not sure whether that's the best option, but I don't believe they have their own parking.  Once we arrived, we were greeted by a few beautiful girls in short-shorts and tiny plaid shirts.  The girls had big smiles and sat us in the awesome patio that overlooks the strip.  We probably had 7-8 different servers (all beautiful girls) stop by our table when walking by, greeting us with smiles, and asking how we were.  The service here was probably the best service I've experienced in years.  No joke.  It could've been 7-8 ugly dudes and it still would've been outstanding service.  The fact that it happened to be a bunch of beautiful ladies...well that's just bonus!!  The food was great as well.  We enjoyed the Blackened Fish Tacos, Buffalo Wings, Steak Sliders, and Smokehouse Burger.  Good portions and delicious food at reasonable prices.    Interestingly there were many groups of ladies who came to the restaurant, which is great because it's not a dude-fest.    I will be back for the food, for the atmosphere, and for the beautiful view!!!  Haha",

The food prices were a little bit steep, but we got a TON of food. I ordered a basket of friend pickles and it was literally so full I couldn't eat even half of them. There had to be 50 to 60 friend pickle slices in my basket. The battering was really good on the pickles, lots of pepper. Very greasy though. My fiance got nachos and the pile was HUGE! They were good nachos with cilantro and higher grade food products as opposed to your typical chili, cheese sauce and jalapenos. The server was very friendly. She stopped by regularly to chat us up and talk about where we were from, how we were enjoying our food, and how the stay was.",

The rock climbing was also a good time. Nothing like drinking beer, watching sports & rock climbing. All that being said it was the people that made the experience. The ladies were tremendous & the managers were great. It was so good that my boy & I went Thursday, Friday, Saturday. There are a select few of the staff I'd like to commend for there service: Jeff (Manager) & Daniel (Manager) helped make the visits an excellent time. I appreciate the professionalism. The ladies that took care of us all 3 nights were just simply great. They were all good people. Kayt scales a rock climbing wall like a damn spider. If you're their the next time I'm in Vegas I will get my revenge. Nikki G. I appreciate the great service. Quite possibly the best waitress I've ever had. Thanks for running to grab the fries (haha).

I wish I had asked for barbecue sauce instead of ranch. The food was great.   While the drinks were a bit expensive you have to keep in mind that it is VEGAS! Everything is cheaper on the STRIP so you have to be mindful of that. Outside of that, the drinks were great.   There are ample TVs all over this place.

    "text": "The corporate hierarchy in Addison, Texas is working hard to ruin the chain. The bean counters are nitpicking pennies by forcing the bartenders to intentionally under-fill the beer glasses and put more ice into the mixed drinks to cut back on the \"expensive\" ingredients. The corporate lawyers are overreacting to a single bogus sexual harassment claim by one of the money-seeking waitresses to impose stringent restrictions on the behavior of everyone else in the whole chain. Now, the rule has come down from the top that no customer is allowed more than two drinks.  (Do I really want to come watch my favorite team only for as long as it takes me to drink two beers??) All of this puts the restaurant managers in a real squeeze.  As a group, they are all about trying to satisfy the customers and maximize profits, but the corporate rules turn them into unreasonable automatons in the eyes of customers and employees. Twin Peaks used to be a really fun place to enjoy cold beer, good food, and the game of your choice.  More recently, it has turned into continuous arguments between the customers, the waitresses, and management. Is this really the way that the big boys in Addison want it to be? I have been a loyal customer of TP for the past five years, but my wife and I are on the verge of quitting the place. Wake up, Addison, you are screwing up big time.  Also, can you put the carrots back in the Mom's Pot Roast please?",

I came in and sat at the bar, the first thing I noticed was the giant wall of TVs, and they had everything from UFC to Hockey to Football, and of course, Basketball.   I got the 13 oz ribeye and a man size glass of the dirty blonde. My server was Ashley and she was really nice and prompt with her service! Kept an eye on my water cup level and always offered to help.  My initial reaction to the dirty blonde beer, a Twin Peaks draft, was that it was extremely delicious! Low IBU and very citrus-y. The steak was really well done, it was a little on the salty side but that works well with the beer. It came with fries and asparagus, I should have asked for mashed potatoes instead I was not feeling fries; but the asparagus had a great texture and flavor.  Oh yeah, the waitresses here have a dress code of low cut red top and short jean shorts, so there's that. Twin Peaks is one of those \"breastaurants.\"  I would rate it 4 stars for the food, (beer and asparagus were 5/5 and steak was 4/5, fries were a 2.) and 5/5 for service.",

And walk ways ,  No world class chefs and no formal dining here but sometimes that's preferred ( often actually )",

Stalling and stalling. I knew the jig was up. I reminded her of the small 4$ of smoke change we needed, then we'll be out of her hair. She smiled and still kept stalling. And stalling. Until I called her for the last time, and this time she became annoyed and some light argument ensued and we ended up just walking away because we didnt want to ruin our night.  Long story short, I BECAME THAT GUY. I made uber stop for ATM, then gas store, then MGM for my friend, then home for me.   Yeah, it was a hassle. I don't get it, this was my go to bar for dear out of towner friends, why all the fuss? Well, not anymore. I'll go find some other bar.",

Long story short, I bought the frozen mug because the server said that other locations would fill it for the \"man beer\" price and you would get a few ounces more as it is a tad bit bigger than the standard glass mug. For the $20 bucks I thought that would be cool.   Look it to my local AZ location. Received a few comments from others at the bar and had a few folks interested in checking out the vegas location on their next trip. Bar tender filled it up when I explained what/where it was from. Having fun so far, glad I bought it.   After enjoying my beer and burger, asked for a refill. Was told that she couldn't because the manager said no.   Not her fault. I was upset that the manager didn't tell me himself (lame to make tipped staff give bad news; what if I was not a cool guy and took it out on her tip?) and that the vegas store either lied to me or their corporate does a horrible job of communicating what these mugs are to the non-vegas locations.   I emailed corporate so I'll update this if they respond. In the interim, as cool as the mug is (good quality, stays cold forever), don't buy it unless you don't care about using it locally (ie outside vegas).   Oh, the food was awesome as always and the server was attentive, important in Vegas. One star because of the mug fiasco.",

I tried saying how we could save our money and go drink crappy overpriced beers and eat crappy overpriced food elsewhere! But noooo.  They insisted on coming here.  I guess I was just the most-sober of the group, and we all paid for it dearly in the end.  6pm, Saturday Evening, Las Vegas strip.  We wanted to watch some football, so we came on in at the insistence of, well, the drunkards.  Cue the confused girl asking how many, then us saying \"4, but another is on his way\" and then her having zero clue what 4+1 is and trying to seat us at a small table.  Next up was a waitress with possibly the worst attitude I have ever encountered.  No smile, no hello, no attempt whatsoever at being a mediocre waitress from the get-go.  Just a silent stare at all of us from start to finish.  Cue beers that took 15 minutes to arrive, appetizers that appeared at the end of the meal, and the staff simply setting plates down in the middle of the table and walking away. We had asked the hostess, the waitress, then a manager to turn one of the 10 TVs to a different game, all of which said \"okay\", then walked away.  Tried again, \"okay\", then walked away.  A half hour later we asked again, they said they couldn't change the TVs: no reasoning, no angle as to why, just \"no\".  Food was nasty.  Cold burger I barely even tried to eat, wings that tasted like they had been reheated 3 times before ever getting to us, and a queso dip with, well... 1% cheese and chips that were soggy.  Why the heck didn't anyone listen to me?  This was 3 days ago, and we are all still running to the bathroom several times a day to avoid the embarrassment of soiling ourselves.  I'd say this place needs a makeover, but as long as they can hide crappy food, service, and overall lack of anything to do with the service industry behind fake breasts and short shorts, they probably don't care.  Can I leave negative stars?",

When we sat down and got situated, we were approached by a sweet looking server. I think her name was Brenda?However as soon as she opened her mouth and started talking to us, it was very apparent that she may have been on some sort of narcotics. So she takes our order and comes back about 5-7 minutes later, she had come back to our table and all of our drinks were empty, so she offered to bring us more. She brought us the second round of drinks and apologized for her own lack of good service . Her apologies how raver seemed more like complaints about the party on the balcony being drunk. About 5 min later she came out with the order and complained about the drunk guys on the balcony a little more and brought us out tab. We quickly paid and left. I was not too impressed. I can understand a bad day at work, but wow! Not the experience we were expecting!",

In fact, they'll even bet you they can beat you and likely take your money.) I had a few clients want to come here to watch a few games and we witnessed one girl beat about 10 guys (and make about an extra $100!).   You came here for the food, right? Not to hear about the scenery. Wrong. This is a glorified Hooters, with better looking girls, better food, better outfits and better service and in most cases better TVs. It's actually a good place to come watch sporting events. You know you didn't come here for the food.   On the other hand, the food isn't bad. It's much better than you'd expect at competitors. In fact, they prep it each morning and it shows in the taste. If you have to eat at a sports bar, this is one of the better ones to chow down at. There's ample beer and liquor. The difference is the wing selection, which rests below what you're used to. Still, there's plenty of other items on the menu to keep you happy.",

    "text": "Visited Twin Peaks with the bros in October during our trip to Las Vegas. Firstly I would like to say that I don't really get excited for tits so this review will be more of a food, drink and quality piece.  We were seated and ordered. I had an ice cold 29.345738459 degree beer. It was like a frozen coke AKA shit. Half way through it I was wishing that I had taken the coke sample. I had the smoke house burger. It was acceptable. The fun part of Twin Peaks is the interaction with the waitresses. They are obviously forced to talk to the customers and they stand over you awkwardly while you are eating. We took this opportunity to tell the waitress that cheese was illegal in New Zealand (where i'm from) and that I am the number one importer of illegal cheese in New Zealand. I then told her i'm the Al Capone of cheese. She then went and told all the other waitresses. Hilarious.   Bathrooms are clean. Lots of TV's, lots of sports.  The following day my bowel movement was smooth. Didn't hurt and their was no blood so that's a win for Twin Peaks as far as i'm concerned.   Would visit again.",

We had mozzarella balls and fried pickles. They were very hot and good and you really can't go wrong. To order I had the hangover burger. A burger with a fried egg, bacon and cheese. Can you really go wrong with that? Also had a side of fries. Service was fast and waitress was friendly and very helpful. The environment is also very chill and fun. You should give it a try when on the vegas strip.",

There were only like 4 tables and it took over an hour for a burger and chicken tenders.  I'm sure there would be more customers if the service wasn't so horrendous.",

I'm a fan of breaded bone-in wings and love Hooters so wanted to see how these compared. I got the sweet chili wings and an order of fried pickles. My boyfriend ordered the cheesesteak sandwich with fries. Our food came out and the cheesesteak meal looked amazing! My boyfriend said it was really good. The wings were great but when they came out I was missing the pickles. I flagged down our waitress and she apologized and said that she forgot to ring them in. It was nice that she owned up to her mistake so I won't dock them there. I still wanted the pickles so I agreed to wait. They came out a few minutes later and were really good. All in all a solid experience but nothing amazingly over the top. Typical bar food but I would visit again.",

Walked in with my boyfriend for lunch and could initially see the first hostess was miserable and proceeded to navigate us to the main entrance.   As soon as we walked over to a group of 2 waitresses and hostess we turned around and walked out.   They looked at us head on, made eye contact, gave us a rude, pissy ass look and continued to carry on their conversation.   No greeting, no hi do you mind waiting a moment,no nothing!!! Completely dirty looks and the worst attitudes I have been around!!!! Fire your staff. Not acceptable for any business and especially if your clientele comes from all the world.   I get it I use to be a waitress and would have those days, but never treat a guest with such rudeness.  First time in Vegas and we wanted a great burger, great drink and good service as we have had at other Twin Peaks. Harley Davidson received our lunch business.",

The server said they normally charge but did not charge me for the dressing.   If they would put dressing on the salad like a normal place and not be skimpy so they can price gouge you, people would not ask for extra.  The wings were not bad, I had the chili parm sauce which was good but the wings themselves were just ok.  What I mean by that is the quality of the wings they use, there were several pieces that were fatty which tells me they don't go for high quality wings.    The salad itself was good even though I am 99% sure it was not organic.  This place gets a lot of business because of the staff they higher so the owner/manager is not really concerned about quality.  This place is more about the view anyway.  My friend loves this place so when we meet to talk about business this is where he likes to go.  It helps keep him focused most of the time.",

But when you sit at the bar and have an empty glass in front of you for 15 minutes without any response. It has hit an all-time low.  Maybe the management needs to hire better quality staff that will engage customers, like it used to be.

    "text": "I ain't gonna lie, I'm a fan on the brostraunts that are cropping up around America. And especially in Vegas, it seems appropriate to visit one of these establishments. Yes, I came with the wife, but she happily agreed. I think it was her tummy talking because she was about to eat a shoe off the Las Vegas strip she was so hungry.  We kinda stumbled on this place. For a late Friday night, it was surprisingly empty. Good for us, I guess. We get seated by the hostess, and keep in mind, it's my first time at a TP.  The girls here wear some insanely short shorts. Like, they had to cut the legs of shorts that were already labeled as Jeezus jean shorts. I mean, these were cut higher than bikinis. I ain't complaining. Nice views, and even the wife's jaw was dropping. Yeah, I got a cool wife.  We ordered a cheeseburger, a dozen classic breaded wings, fries, and a house brew.  The beer was actually pretty good, but I got the big 22 oz, and couldn'd finish it because I just had too much food in me. The burger was actually good. I mean don't expect a great burger, but for late night after club food, this burger hits the spot. But the surprise were the wings. The wings were excellent. Perfect ratio of breading to actual meat. Not so spicy, but spicy enough. Very good. Fries were fries.  Girls were running around. It seems they were understaffed, but the bar girls served as our waitress as well. She defied all odd and had the shortest shorts ever. I can't even explain it. Well, I can, but that's for a different forum.  Give this place a chance.",

    "text": "Being from Canada, I find it amazing to see chain restaurants delivering consistency when it comes to food and service. Twin Peaks is a chain I've wanted to check out for years and finally got a chance to go on my last Vegas visit.   My girlfriend and I went to the location on the Strip, adjacent to Planet Hollywood and the Miracle Mile row of shops and restaurants - a top-tier area if you're on the hunt for a bite to eat. You're never out of reach of solid dining options when you hit the Strip; at the time, we were just craving a snack between drinks and I thoroughly believe we came to the right spot!  The service was friendly and hospitable the second we walked through the doors here! The good-looking servers donning a smile gave us tips on the food and drink menus and kept dropping by to see if we were satisfied with our orders. A big central oval bar here means you're never too far from a refreshing pint of cold beer! The girlfriend and I decided on a couple cold brews - the hefeweizen was quite welcome after dealing with the blistering heat outside - and two wing flavours - Jalapeno Butter and Spicy Thai Chili. The Jalapeno Butter wings were coated in a buttery sauce, not too spicy, but just right! The Spicy Thai Chili were our favourites and would be contenders in the top 10 wings I've ever eaten in my life; everyone needs to try this flavour here at least once!   Despite the restaurant being mostly empty when we went, the few other diners seemed to enjoy their cold brews, big pub-style burgers, and chatting up the servers, who were not only nice to chat with, but also quick and efficient. Of course there are better options nearby - it's Vegas - but give Twin Peaks a shot and I bet you'll leave with a good impression!",

I did see a black persons bit, his group was diverse. Even though I noticed this, I gave them the benefit of the doubt. I enjoyed my service. Our waitress, Brittney, provided excellent service. I loved the wings so I decided to go back. Interestingly, the second time we were instructed to go back to the 3rd floor. This was crazy because BOTH times there were plenty of seating. We ask the hostess can we sit at the lower level, she respond we can sit at the bar. At this point I'm curious on the seating arrangement, I asked our bartender on the seating arrangement. She insensitively stated \"oh, we try to even out the amount of people on both levels.\" Of course this made perfect sense because there's waitresses and a bar on both levels. I gave them the benefit of a doubt AGAIN! As we sit at the bar, we noticed two black groups go upstairs and over 4 whites be placed downstairs. That's not called even out it's called discrimination. I will never spend another dollar at a Twin Peaks in ANY state. My skin color is not welcomed but my dollars are.",

We ate, had a few drinks... 6 of us crammed at a table for 4 because every other table was reserved for Fantasy football. One of my friends ordered a raspberry vodka tonic. The second drink she ordered came back pink, clearly not raspberry vodka and tonic. More like vodka grapefruit or something??? The waitress proceeds to tell us that they must be out of raspberry vodka. They took liberty to just pour any random drink rather than ask us a preference because they are now out of raspberry vodka. My other friend ordered a double tequila/ rocks, comes back way different than the other 2 he had. Second waitress comes to ask him to describe the drink so she could make sure that the bartender made it right. She was condescending and bitchy. They were out of a lot of liquor/beer selections! 3 kinds of which our table had ordered. We had 3 different waitress and we weren't unruly by any means. Drink orders were taking so long that we asked for our check to be split 4 ways. Big mistake. We should've taken the check and figured it out ourselves. Waited over 45min to get our checks! We asked for a manager. Manager on duty had just started. She asked us what the problems were. We explained. Not that we wanted anything for free but she did ABSOLUTELY NOTHING to make right on our horrible service experience!!! She apologized and slapped us with a bill that we would still like to argue. Done with waiting any more time, we paid it. 4 of us are locals and keep giving this place a chance! 4.5 out of 5 times, food/check or service is bad! We are done! You can find us across the street at Sierra Gold now that it is open! Ridiculous and embarrassing we brought out of town friends to experience this!",

With an empty restaurant, our main server (don't remember name) very infrequently visited our table to check in with us.

I know many people are tourists that come to these sports bars and they are quick to write a bad review because they weren't seated right away or god forbid they were accidentally given fries instead of chips.

Steamed broccoli - didn't need salt but was drowning in it.  Portions are huge. Waitresses are awesome. Value is awesome - if you really, really love salt.  Both of us felt our tongues were almost \"burnt\" feeling after all the salt.  So unnecessary.  If you're worried that your dishes need flavor, try some other herbs and spices, or put interesting sauces on the table.  We won't be coming back until then.",

Right on the strip, 3 stories, rock climbing wall, and outdoor seating with a great view. Just like every other Twin Peaks, it has below freezing draft beer, which is always a plus. I ordered the chicken biscuit sliders, and I was pleasantly surprised at how great they were. Peppered biscuits, chicken fried chicken, jalapeno cream gravy, cheese, and bacon. THE BACON! Omg. Thick cut, coated in cayenne pepper and brown sugar. It's the perfect combination of sweet and spicy. Definitely recommend with a French fries and a little hair of the dog after a night out in Vegas. Gabi was our server, and not only was she sweet and bubbly, but knowledgeable about the menu. I never expected to be telling you to try Twin Peaks while out in Vegas...but seriously, try it.",

My buddy and I went there for the first time one afternoon and never wanted to leave the place.  We met this incredible waitress named Sara from Las Vegas and it has been a must \"go to\" location every time I go to vegas which is about once a month. (I know, Vegas is too close to Cali for my own good)  Of course, Sara has become my favorite all time waitress. She always treats us as if we are her only table.  Very personable, very attentive and quick to refill our beers...  She even taught me how to climb the 3 story wall and feel like a stud. Of course until the last time I went and she challenged me to a race up the wall. That girl is strong and swift too!  I can't count how many times I have returned to see Sara,  only to find the whole restaurant is spectacular... The best place to watch sporting events from NFL and College sports to the UFC.  Go early, get a seat, and enjoy some of the best beers in town... The Dirty Blond is my favorite beer (No, Sara is a red head!) and the queso is awesome... and In fact, my recommendation for best hangover food on the Strip is Mom's Pot Roast.... mmmm mmmm good!",

We come to Twin Peaks a lot and as a local business owner we bring some of our customers. Gabby (Gabrielle) was one of the best servers we have had in a long time. She interacted with our group perfectly. Hope our group was not to obnoxious for her. Then there was Jewels, she wasnt even our server but after Gabby went home she kept checking on us. Both girls were great. The guys that cleared the tables even came to check on us. The only disappointing thing that happened last night was when we walked in we specifically asked if they would be showing the Golden Knight Game and were told absolutely. However, after we ordered and got all settled in the manager on duty said they would not be playing the sound on the hockey game until the football game was over. So all the girls in the place were wearing Golden Knights attire, there was way more hockey fans there and only 2 football fans but they choose to play football. We might have to look for another place to go and watch hockey.",

Another year has passed and, once again, the folks at this location did not disappoint.  As for the service, we were tended to this year by Yasmine on one day and Nicoley on the next. Both were attentive and friendly (in addition to being gorgeous). These gals hustled and seemingly took good care of all of their tables. One of the Managers we encountered previously (Miller) was there again this year. He too seems customer service oriented and is often visible on the floor (vs. hiding in the back or tapping away on his phone). Real good guy.  As for the food, I noticed a few new items on the menu. I especially enjoyed the smoked and grilled wings and spicy chipotle chicken. The burgers I've had there are comparable to elsewhere. The kitchen got our orders out in a reasonable period of time, despite being busy. I've seen some places struggle with this.  Please note that this location usually has a $45-$50/person minimum during NFL playoff season, per game. I noticed many folks walk in & right back our because of this. Funny thing though, most folks will easily toss down 3-4 beers a game and a plate of food. Guess what, you just hit their minimum without realizing it. Start drinking those fancy beers, and you've exceeded the minimum.",

When we arrived my wife kinda rolled her eyes when she saw the servers outfits, or lack thereof. Ah well. The decor was quite enjoyable. We sat on the patio upstairs and the view was very nice.   Our server was quite friendly, we ordered appetizers, which arrived before we even ordered our entrees, about 10-15 minutes later. We had nachos, and a (SMALL!) cup of the venison chili for appetizers, very nice. For entrees we ordered the pulled pork sliders and a poblano chicken sandwich with fries. The chicken sandwich fell apart as I ate it. It seemed to be possessed by a McDonalds hamburger. One bite and everything wanted to fall out of the far side. Our server at this point seemed to disappear. When finished eating and waited a good 10-15 minutes for her to return with our check. She seemed more interested in socializing then tending to the needs of her guests.   All in all it was a very nice experience, but honestly I could flip a coin about returning or not. If someone else, say from out of town, wanted to try the place, I could go back, but I might try thinking of other places to go as well.",

Woo-hoo!  Proud girlfriend moment!!  We shared a cheeseburger and fries.  It was just ok.  Pretty small burger...and only about 10 fries...definitely not worth the $11ish we paid for it.  Pretty disappointing.  :/   They did take our picture and give us a free copy.  They tried to get us to buy the larger print, but it wasn't very flattering...pass!  Haha!  :)  Overall...I don't think I'd go back, just due to their high prices...but the rock climbing was pretty cool!",

They reserved us seats at the upstairs middle bar facing the strip just because we called ahead. Our two bartenders were both gorgeous and incredibly attentive. Two different managers stopped by to see how we were doing. The food was tits (pun intended) the beers were ice cold, and the value vs. what you get everywhere else in Vegas is unparalleled. Kudos. It's so very clear the leadership at this place has a major focus on hospitality, and it shined through during our entire experience. Truly a breath of fresh air on the strip. I cannot recommend this place enough. Run - don't walk!",

Comes with a strip of bacon which is a nice touch.   The chicken and shrimp were good too.  The chicken was very tender.  I'm bummed that i filled up on fried pickles and mozzarella.  I couldn't even finish my food which is rare for me.  The bachelor in our group tried to climb the wall.  It's just 10 bucks for 3 attempts.  The wall is harder to climb than it looks.",

The rock wall is always fun to watch, but most people can't climb it if they are dressed to be out on the strip. I've sampled the food from buffets and they have always been pretty middle of the line. It's hard to know how long before it has been prepped for a private event. Overall, I don't mind it and the waitresses are attentive so I'll rate it right in the middle.",

Having been here once before, I knew the food wasn't bad, either. /rimshot  I went up to the bar and ordered the chicken tender and fries \"appetizer\" which turned out to be more than enough food. Besides admiring the friendly tag team of bartenders and their beautiful...smiles...I also enjoyed watching a myriad of games on the bank of TVs set up at the bar.   Even if I had the time to race one of the staff up the famous indoor rock climbing structure, I need to spend some more time in the gym to get ready for that! LOL  For Vegas purposes, Twin Peaks is a good place to pre-game before a \"naughty\" night out.",

We stumbled upon twin peaks as we were wandering and decided to check it out. The food was affordable and everyone found something they would order so we sat down.   We were sat on the balcony over looking the strip and ordered some beers. Our waitress julissa (spelling?) was awesome. She was very attentive, nice and didn't even give us a dirty look when we asked for separate checks. I ordered the steak and was pretty impressed with how good it was for how non expensive it was. All 6 of my friends made it a point to mention that they felt the same way. Would definitely eat here again and would highly recommend this place!",

    "text": "Came here with a large party of nine, and they were able to seat us right away upstairs.  Out of all of the waitresses working, we all agreed that we got the best waitress there. Our waitress was named Tina, she's blonde and from Idaho. She had no problem splitting our tabs up, and was very friendly. A Latina girl who's name I didn't get was the one that brought the entrees out and she was a dime piece as well. Lol.  As far as the food goes, I had the hangover burger and it was just okay... the fries come seasoned similar to Red Robin. I paid $20 for a \"32 oz.\" beer that came in a cool souvenir cup, but was very disappointed to reuse it later and discover a 24 oz. tall can fills the same cup up! Tina was either mistaken when she told me it was a 32 oz. \"Vegas size,\" (I forgive her) or they're cheating people out of 8 oz. of beer, which would be wrong. There's no way to really know, since it's not listed on the menu, but explained by the waitress. Those beers are served at 29 degrees too, which I liked, but one of my buddy's didn't since his kind of slushed up.  Overall, this is a cool place, there's a lot going on in here: rock climbing, \"shotskis,\" and plenty of TV's and eye candy. What more could you ask for?",
