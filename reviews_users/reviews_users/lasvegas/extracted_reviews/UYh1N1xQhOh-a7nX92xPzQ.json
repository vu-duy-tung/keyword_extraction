It's also a great value, with dinner items around $20 per head.  Service has consistently been good, and they do a good job keeping an eye on your bread & drinks, & asking if you want more.  I had the lasagna, which was very good and Mrs. C was extremely happy with her petite filet mignon.  The restaurant is slightly noisy with an open kitchen, so it's also good for families or if you have small children.  Brio is a nice change of pace if you're trying to get away from the buffets, and just 5 minutes from the airport or Mandalay Bay!",

Their beef carpaccio comes out on this gigantic plate with salad on top, and there do a peppered shrimp over fried eggplant in this amazing sauce.  I mention the last two since they're on a new happy hour menu available at the bar.  The carpaccio is smaller on the happy hour menu but it's also like $3 and change and you can treat the menu at the bar like a bunch of small places.  The steak salad is great... I've never had their sandwiches but a friend who ordered one wasn't impressed.  I just wouldn't think of sandwiches first when going to Brio anyway.",

Food ordered was calamari, caprese salad, and the nine ounce filet with Gorgonzola crust and roasted vegetables.  I ordered a planned dessert of creme brulee to be brought after our dinner was consumed.  Meat was phenomenal.  Was cooked well done despite my tastes, yet retained juice and texture.  Amazing bite.  The accompanying veggie partnership was well thought of.    I found no issue with the caprese or the calamari.  Both were well made for a hometown Italian place like this.  I was impressed with the flavor profile of the mozzarella and the crisp texture of the squid.    My issue was with the timing.  We received our apps, salads, and main course simultaneously and then never received our dessert at all.  The timing had put off my date, whom said Brio is fired.  Despite my likings for this menu, I probably won't come back much, due to this experience.",

Many options to chose from, such as salad, pasta, paninis, flatbreads and more.  I decided to go with angel hair pasta with salmon.  The angel hair pasta was cooked perfectly, not too soft, not too hard.  The salmon was a a tad bit more cooked than I would have liked, but because there was a nice scampi butter sauce, it was still delicious.  I will definitely return to try their items on the happy hour menu.",

And I got the spicy shrimp fettuccine, seeing the price being $20 I expected it to be great, and that being said, the shrimp was hard, pasta wasn't fully cooked, and I found probably 3 lobster. Great sauce. But couldn't be happy eating it. We got the cheesecake for dessert and at that point I was over it as well as to how mushy it was. I'd give brio a second try one day but unbelievable as to how my first time went.",

Our server, I believe his name was Jessie, was very charismatic, attentive, and knowledgeable about the menu. From the wine suggestion he made to the help he gave us deciding on our meals- he was an Allstar! We felt like we were a special table even though we know how busy it was. Overall, a great night- make sure you ask for Jessie!",

He was on top of drink orders, making sure the food was correct and placed in front of the right person. He was never intrusive when coming in to check on us, somehow made us feel taken care of but never bothered. Truly a great experience and would recommend to others.",

The feeling I got as soon as I walked in and asked a simple question was as they were doing customers a favor by letting you in.   I choose to ignore their lack of courtesy, asked for patio which faced towards Victoria Secrets and behind their bar, they said it was closed although there we people sitting there. Then they took us instead to another outsite section which basically had no one sitting in the area.  I simply left this restaurant and inmediately ran into California Kitchen, which had a much better attitute towards customers.  Maybe some badic manners trainning would help this hostes at the entrance representing Brio.",

    "text": "Lunch Menu/Service Review  I met a client here for a lunch meeting, along with a couple other co-workers. Luckily we arrived before the lunch rush at 11 AM, right when they open. We were seated in the expansive dining area at a large booth. The server arrived right away and took our order.  Bread service - comes with sliced white bread, kind of dry, and seasoned toast points. Olive oil/balsamic come along for the ride, as well as butter. OK.  Next up - raspberry iced tea, incredibly sweet, obviously some sort of soft-drink style concoction, not great.  Main entree: Pasta BRIO - \"Rigatoni, grilled chicken, seared mushrooms and roasted red pepper sauce\" - $14.85  While pasta was well-cooked and sauce was delicious, chicken pieces had something to be desired. Mushrooms however were a nice addition, although I didn't get any hint of the searing, it seemed like they were just cooked in with the pasta. Overall, OK, but for the price kind of deflating.  Price points my party felt were a little out-there compared to the quality and quantity of the food we were served.   Coffee service after the meal - a very strong brew accompanied by individual creamers for each person in the party (I liked that).  Service - good and on point.  Atmosphere - Nice when we arrived, but as the dining room filled up it became VERY loud and it was hard to carry on a conversation, especially business-related since we didn't really want to yell into any other person's face over the noise.  Overall - A-OK. Better than most chain Italian restaurants out there.",

We got seated right away, 4 total in the party, and for about 10-15 mins no waiter or anyone noticed us or said anything until I finally asked a bus boy to grab her. Not a good start but whatever, the service was bad for brio standards tonight, at least she was friendly.   So the good, the reason we come. The food was great. We had calamri and sausage pepperoni pizza to start. Great. I got the lobster bisque and as always great. For dinner I had lamb, great!!, my wife had rissoito, pretty good, my friend had shrimp Vodak pasta, very good and his girlfriend had steak salad, which she enjoyed. For dessert we split tiramisu and creme breleu, both very good. Overall great meal and mediocre service. Will come back as the service is usually much better than today.",

Luckly I spoke with the manager, Craig who was so nice to accommodate for my group & I & set us up in their Chef's room with Craig as our waiter. They let us order off of the HH menu. Was so grateful that my plans were not ruined & I wouldn't be disappointing my Meetup groups!! Thank you so much Craig!!! Craig, our waiter was great too! They have great choices for drinks & food on their HH menu. Fried ravioli is so yummy! Along with their shrimp & eggplant dish. I was soooo full due to their reasonable servings! The Rosa Sangria is delicious & light! I have been here before & definitely  will go back & highly recommend  this place!!!  Town Square is such a great location too with lots of shopping to do afterwards & walk off the food!",

    "text": "Went here on a tuesday night with a group of 4 after one member of our party declared she'd been burned out on spicy food, and required some pasta. It was 9:30 at night, we didn't want to spend $32 a plate on the strip, and so we decided to give long passed-by Brio a try.  The verdict; upscale olive garden that knows what Al Dente means. So 3 stars at least for that. We had hoped to sit outside, but after putting our names in for a table, got so quickly ushered to a seat next to the miniature Colosseum replica (?!...Why would you build that?!) that we sort of gave up on asking.  Very much has the same \"upscale chain that doesn't want to be considered a chain\" vibe as a Yardhouse or a McCormick and Shmick's.   There was absolutely nothing wrong with the food. We had a calamari appetizer, 2 basil gimlets, a lemonade, 3 pasta dishes and a salad. We might have all been really hungry, but we also finished everything, and then nibbled at some of the crumbs. I actually wish they would have offered a refill on the bread, as my jerk tablemates ate all the french, and left me the crackers, but this offer was not forthcoming. That was sort of the modus opperandi. Nothing extra or surprising or special, no extras extended. You get what you ask for, you pay for what you ask for. Nothing wrong with that, just nothing to get super excited about, either.   I had the sausage and tomato pasta, which was good; the pasta actually had flavor and texture, which I had hoped for but not expected. The tomatoes were actually fresh and the fennel sausage a bit on the dry side, but crispy and very flavorful. I ate the whole thing and enjoyed it. I just doubt I'll remember anything about it a month from now.   Brio seems like a very safe bet; I'm sure if I went back in 6 months I would have a very similar experience. It would be a great place to take my utterly unadventurous friends and relatives when they visit from out of town. If I was still doing the dating thing and on a blind date, had to do a working lunch, or meet an estranged relative I knew nothing about, this might be a good place to avoid judgments.",

The flavor, texture, everything is perfect. My favorite is their artichoke dip appetizers. Omg, i get this every time before i order our entrees. I am a very loyal customer so once you get me going, i will return. And this is my second time here.  My first time was the best. The waiter was also the server and he looked like he enjoyed working there. If i was able to request who my waiter is, and if I remembered his name, i would have done it in a heartbeat. Unfortunately, i cant because the second time, the customer service was so off. My waiter was great and friendly, but my server was not. He just threw the bread onto the table(it even slid upwards). Like wtf? Crapper server. Pissed me off. And then when he brought my dish, he left the plate half hanging off the table in front of me. It could have easily fallen all onto me but I grabbed it and pushed it in. Something he should have done because I can easily burn myself from that. Usually, all the waiters will tell you to not touch the plate. This guy just leaves it half hanging from the table and expect you to take care of it yourself. Also, when he came to pay time, i waited for a long while and had to ask someone else if I can get the check and to go box. :/ my waiter just disappeared on us.   However, i will still leave this a 5/5 because i personally love all the other waiters. Especially the waiter from our first time being here. He was so ecstatic to serve us and take our order. He has really good opinions on what to eat and everything. The food itself has always been delicious. The first and the second time, I can honestly say I rather go to brio than cpk. The pricing is only $2-$5 more expensive than cpk but its also $2-$5 worth more than cpk.  *edited, changed it to 4/5 since the manager here completely avoided my concern about how the server during my second visit was rude.",

SO GOOD. this is a solid 4.5 but i rounded up because of our experience there  this was the place for our last night in vegas dinner and wow was it such a good choice.  location & pricing: the pricing is a bit on the higher side, but its totally worth every penny. the location of it is in the heart of the shopping center or square or whatever its called.  atmosphere: this place inside and out - was so nice. they had nice couches outside, and a plush entryway, and a wonderful setting on the inside. it was a pretty ornate looking interior. dim lights, curtains, rich carpets.  taste: AHHH SOSOSO GOOD. we ordered the brio's bruschetta trio, and since we didn't know what to order, we asked our waiter for recommendations. what great recommendations that STEVE gave us. we got the bistecca alla fiorentina, artichoke encrusted beef medallions, pasta brio, and the mushroom ravioli al forno. it was soooo delicious. perfect seasoning, perfect spice & flavor. oh and the complimentary bread!! we had crispy and soft bread.   so we did order the brio's bruschetta trio, but we didn't actually get to try it - steve totally forgot about it and cancelled the bruschetta and offered us the dolchino sampler: peach cobbler, mocha mousse?, creme brulee, cheesecake with a raspberry sauce, applebread, milk chocolate cake with caramel, and tiramisu. the only bad thing is that it was a little \"too much of a good thing\" scenario. while it was so decadent and wonderful, it was a little too rich to finish everything even amongst the four of us (one guy and three girls)  service: STEVE. impeccable. we even got his card - he works everyday except sunday (to watch football), and when we are back (and WE WILL!) we're going to make sure in hell that we sit at steve's table.",

On top of that they got my daughters meal wrong, which was sent back and took forever for them to make.  But the flavor was definitely sub-standard. Probably my last time eating there considering the cost.  It's not worth paying $18 for a flavorless plate and walking away hungry.",

    "text": "We craved for Italian cuisine so my girlfriend brought us to Brio Tuscan Grille, an elegant and inviting Italian restaurant located in the upscale Town Square in Las Vegas.   A waitstaff greeted us at the door as we arrived and directed us to our seats. The restaurant has a certain sophistication to it: chic, elegant interior with tasteful accoutrements, high ceilings, flowing drapery, and well-trained staff -- you wouldn't even think that this is a chain restaurant.   The menu has a good selection of insalatas, bruschettas, zuppas, paninis, and pasta. They also have a nice selection of house specialties but I didn't order any of that. The wine selection is not too extensive but you'll certainly find the perfect wine to pair your dish with.   The shrimp and scallop risotto was well-seasoned and flavorful; I paired it with a glass of pinot Grigio. My friends loved their dishes as well, which they generously shared with me (and vice versa).  The price range is very reasonable considering the restaurant's ambiance, the quality of dishes, and the quality of service that we got. Overall, I'm happy with the experience.",

The waitress acted like she was bothered serving us, she almost stabbed my mother (slid a sharp knife across the table instead of handing it) and didn't bring us silverware after we asked several times (not sure why it wasn't already on the table). Anyway the food was mediocre at best, I've had better Italian food at Olive Garden. I had a Caesar salad, but I tried the chicken and penne ala vodka. My chicken was burnt and the others were just ok. Aside from a hair in the food and sticky silverware. Will not visit again.",

Tamara went out of her way to see that our meal was excellent and it was appreciated in my tip. They also have the best tasting flat bread to nibble on while you wait for appetizers and main course. To my shock I discovered that this is actually part of a chain. This is the best chain I have ever eaten at for Italian food. The impression was more like a fine dining experience in beverly hills or pasadena. I think that they have an incredible future if they stick to this formula. Meticulous attention to detail and of course great tasting food. I will definitely be back as I live in summerlin and I discovered they have a place at tivoli.",

Slightly better than OK, but not quite \"Yay, I'm a fan!\"  I have been to Vegas many times to visit family but never to the Town Square development.  I liked the overall feel of the area with many shops and restaurants, and we enjoyed walking around before dinner.   We had a reservation, but showed up a few minutes early so we had to wait.  It was actually quite chilly that night so we really noticed the door opening and closing as we waited in the restaurant foyer, I was feeling sorry for the hostesses and the tables that were seated near the door!  I had the chopped salad to start - quite tasty - and the mediterranean penne pasta, which was vegetarian but you could add chicken or shrimp.  My companions split the caesar and had shrimp scampi and the lobster and shrimp pasta.  My pasta was tasty but  a little too heavy on the olive oil.  My sister in law devoured the scampi and my brother's lobster and shrimp was also quickly disappearing so I managed to reach over and snag  a piece of lobster before it was gone - nice and tender and in a slightly spicy sauce.  The flatbread in the bread basket was DELICIOUS and the service and drinks were fine.  I would agree that the prices are a little high - more like Vegas strip pricing than Vegas mall pricing - but it was a nice experience.",

The food was amazing (guests LOVED the menu) and the service was truly exceptional.

It's all about that sauce. This dish never disappoints and I usually always get this when I visit Brio. No, seriously!!! A few other favorites I have had before (but not on this particular visit) include Beef Carpaccio, Lobster Bisque, Bistecca Insalata, Roasted Whole Chicken.   On this visit, we had the Spicy Shrimp & Eggplant, Bruschetta Sampler, Pasta Alla Vodka, Torta di Cioccata, and Creme Brulee. Everything was good! Our server Jason was very good. Friendly, informative and attentive. We'll be back!  I also had a Cucumber Basil Gimlet which may be one of my new favorite cocktails. Hendrick's Gin, fresh basil, crushed cucumber, Angostura bitters, fresh lemon and lime, on the rocks. Refreshing and light drink.",

My friends also enjoy dishes such as the pork chops.   ~ If venturing for dinner, I would avoid the basic salads as the price doesn't warrant the size. Lunch time is a much better deal.   ~ GET THE CARAMEL MASCARPONE CHEESECAKE! IT'S F***ING AMAZING!!!  ~ For this specific location, I've found that during peak times, their service seems to slow down quite tremendously--more so than you'd expect. Off-hours are best and quick if you're in a hurry.   Overall, if you're looking for a good restaurant with a wide variety of options, Brio is a solid pick.

Definitely not someone that should be your \"first impression\". We used to come here all the time for dinner since it is not too far from the house but they have apparently cut their portion sizes in half while prices of course remain the same. Ordered a side of shrimp along with my salad that didn't even come out hot. Gotta love paying 6 bucks for cold shrimp (NOT!)  This along with the piss poor service and joke of a GM (Jose) is enough to make me stay far away from this place- and you should too!",

I came here with some friends and we ordered the red sangria which I thought was delicious but my friends said it was too bitter. I think to each their own. They preferred the white sangria.  We started off with the tomato and mozzarella salad, the beef carpaccio and the black pepper shrimp! Everything was delicious of all three my favorite was the shrimp.  Next we ordered the dessert trio and a dessert. I have no idea what we were thinking, I guess we were hungry at this point the alcohol had set in and our server convinced us. The trio had mascarpone,creme brulee,and a strawberry short cake mason jar. We also ordered the brownie sundae. Delicious! My favorite was the mascarpone. All together our check was less than 50. What a steal. Definitely coming back!",

    "text": "It was 14 of us celebrating an engagement party on June 1st. I called twice to let them know that we are celebrating a friend's engagement.  I asked if they could provide us with a surprise desert with a candle.   They said they could do that.   When I got there and asked the host about it, she told me I need to speak with a waiter.  To me, that was a red flag and it alarmed me.  I called twice in one week to tell them about it and I need to tell all over again to a waiter?  Anyway, I arrived early so told the waiter and he said no problem.  We will prepare something for you with a candle.  I relaxed.  We all ordered and our food arrived.  I ordered spaghetti Bolognese but spaghetti pomodoro arrived.  The waiter made a mistake on my order so I waited for them to remake mine.  Finally my spaghetti Bolognese arrived.  It was clear it didn't have enough sauce on it.  I saw more spaghetti than a Bolognese sauce so I asked for more sauce.  Everyone at my table agreed it needed more sauce.  More sauce arrived few minutes later.  Towards the end, the waiter brought a surprise cake with all melted ice cream on top.  I didn't complain because I thought it was a complimentary.  I was shocked when I received my check.  It was whopping $37.42!  They charged that extra Bolognese sauce that needed in a first place and never informed me that it will be an extra AND the cake with melted ice cream as well!  The spaghetti Bolognese was only $17 so I was expecting to pay around $25 with a tip.  They never told me that the sauce is going to be an extra charge or the desert!!  How dare you!  That dish didn't have ENOUGH Bolognese sauce in a first place and you are charging me for an extra sauce?  Why didn't you tell me it would cost extra?  It's OK to charge a desert with a melted ice cream?  OK, my friend, a bride, was in the lady's room & didn't return to a table for about 10 - 15 minutes but you are going to charge me a full desert price with melted ice cream?  I was sooooo disgusted and sooo annoyed!  I should have said something to the waiter but I didn't want to spoil the moment.  I told everyone about it later on and we all decided not to go back there.  Give me back my money!  You greedy jerks!!!",

Though I found it odd the form asks to write down our password access to sign up for it.  Fine.  Make it kooky.  Stacy, the waitress attending to my table, is super sweet and smiley.  I hope you get her as your waitress.  Was polite and checked on me enough; not overdone.  Even looked cautious about asking cuz I was on my phone... Yelping ppptthh :P  I enjoyed my short rib & white cheddar open faced sandwich.  Challenge was not being able to eat it like a regular sandwich nor like a pizza.  Made use of the interesting fork and knife.  Plus it's cleaner for the face.  I didn't want 'BBQ stick face'.  Really nice interior decor and high ceilings.  Booths are pretty spacious.  Bar area was quiet for a Saturday, but loungy.  It'd be nice to hold a small party here.  Patio seating has umbrellas and palm trees.  An enjoyable space.  Now if Italian music were playing instead, that might make it feel more like another country ;)",

Even though they had heat lamps it was chilly. We decided to wait for an indoor table. The wait lasted almost 30 minutes and there's very little area to stand in while waiting.  This restaurant has a VERY lively bar that you can also dine at. It was full and loud. The layout of the restaurant is laid back but accommodates few tables in the main dining area. The entire end of the restaurant restaurant is taken up by the trio that plays on the weekends. Fearing the noise we were happy to find that the trio played familiar but low keyed music that didn't interfere with the dining experience.  Now the food. It was very good with emphasis on Italian naturally. We ordered different items and all were quite good with enough left over to take home. Our waiter was outstanding, friendly, competent and kidding. Every time he brought out a dish he would say, \"Take a Picture\". It was funny.  Anyway I don't think we will go back. While we enjoyed the food, the atmosphere just was found wanting. When you make a reservation that should ask if you want indoor or outdoor seating.",

But the kids love the food and we don't have a choice when they choose this place. Maybe the Summerlin location has given us a better experience in the past...",

We usually come here for an occasion, or for lunch happy hour because their pricing is a little expensive.  I always end up getting some sort of pasta, with a nice sauce. I love their ravioli pasta and chicken limon!   Customer service wise, I've gotten the good, the bad and the in between. Although, our last experience here was actually not so bad. I believe our server might've been new, so she didn't seem like she knew everything on the menu when we asked her about some entrees. It was my friends birthday, so we asked her to bring a surprise cake out for him, or something cute to surprise him. After a few minutes, she comes to our table and asks us who's birthday it is and what kind of cake he would want. He had no idea, and sort of laughed. But instead of just bringing one out to surprise him, she kind of ruined the surprise. But I guess things happen, but it would have been nicer to surprise him. Next time, I'll be sure to make myself clear. LOL",

I saw a few state dishes and even a lobster dish that looked delicious so I will be back to try Brio for dinner. The ambience is very pleasant especially with the outdoor seating just be prepared to have sunglasses if you decide to come on a sunny day.",

    "text": "This review is for Brio Tuscan Grille's happy hour, but frankly, considering how poorly happy hour went, I'm never coming back here to try their lunch or dinner. I wanted to try a new happy hour and had heard good things about Brio's food. I took my sister with me to try it out and off we went.  As soon as the first thing happened, I knew I should have just turned back around and tried another restaurant at Town Square. What happened? There were three employees up at the front of the restaurant chatting with each other and when we entered, I said two for happy hour. The guy said happy hour hour was on the patio and turned back to chatting with his fellow employees. I had never been to Brio before and wasn't sure how to get to the patio. Did he want me to go outside to gain access? Through the restaurant? His arm gesture wasn't too exact. So I asked how to get there, trying to subtly convey \"Could you walk us there?\" but nope. The guy just kept arm gesturing and said to sit out on the patio.  Fine. We walk through the restaurant and exit out a door to the patio. We see an empty table and sit down to wait for a waiter. Five minutes or so later, a harried waiter comes by and asks if we were seated by the front. I said no, we were here for happy hour and the guy up front just told us to sit out on the patio. Apparently the real tables were not meant for people during happy hour and that the couches by the fire pit was designated for happy hour. Uh, that was not mentioned, and this time I flat out asked if the waiter could show us this area. He did and I have to say, the area for happy hour sucked. The tables were made out of some flimsy material (some kind of flexible wood? I don't know) and the chairs/couches were terrible for eating on.  The waiter said he didn't know which waiter was going to serve us, but he would find out. I thought that was strange, but didn't think much of it. Again, another thing that should have made me just walk out with my sister and try another restaurant at Town Square instead. He came back and said he was our waiter and the entire time, he was just twitchy, like he didn't want to serve us. I guess it's because we were doing happy hour and by default, happy hour customers' bills won't be as high as someone just having dinner? Which is a stupid reason but one I kept leaning towards the longer we stayed at Brio.  I ordered a vodka martini which reads on the menu \"Sobieski Vodka your way: Dirty or Dry with an Olive or Twist.\" When I ordered it, however, the waiter never gave me an option on how I wanted the martini. When it was served to me, I took a sip and nearly spat it out. It tasted terrible. If it wasn't for the fact that I paid for alcohol, I would have just set it aside, but I finished it because I paid for it and I wasn't going to waste it (but I definitely wasn't happy drinking something I didn't like).  As for happy hour food, we ordered tomato margherita flatbread, brio burger, and crispy cheese ravioli to share between us. The order took awhile to get to us and when it arrived, the burger was cold and the chips on top of it were stale. It was a dish I thought my sister would enjoy the most because it's a burger, but she refused to eat it after one bite. Instead she ate most of the ravioli. The flatbread was okay, just okay, but it's not something I'd want to pay for.  After a disappointing meal and happy hour (sad hour), I asked the waiter as he passed by for the check. I wanted to leave and wash away this disappointment. It took him awhile to hand me my bill and then it took even longer for him to return with my credit card. At that point my disappointment slipped into frustration. Why the heck would a restaurant have a happy hour if they don't want to have a happy hour? Because that's how it felt like. The seating for happy hour was terrible, the staff was terrible, the customer service was certainly terrible, and whether they were short staffed or not, don't act like you don't want me there because I'm going for happy hour and not expensive dinner prices.  Brio Tuscan Grille is one place I will never go to again and, frankly, I will always anti-recommend to people whenever possible. If I could give this place negative stars, I would.",

I assumed they are a bigger city franchise, but it was still fun to try a place we don't have in lincoln. Service was exquisite and our waiter was very nice in answering our questions and frequently refilling our waters. We all opted for the lunch combos-reasonably priced and ended up being the perfect amount of food. I got the pasta brio with the red pepper sauce, chicken, and mushrooms over rigatoni. It had really good flavor in the sauce and was evenly portioned with the chicken and mushrooms. I also got Caesar salad for my side and loved it. It was the type of creamy but yet still oily homemade Caesar I expect at Italian restaurants like this. My husband got the fettuccini Alfredo and liked his dish as well. My friend said the tomato basil soup was one of the best she'd ever tried. They made sure we had enough bread and got a second basket as well. I really enjoyed the seasoned flatbread, in addition to the traditional bread that was served. This was a great meal to have before getting on the plane-filling but not overly stuffed or something that is going to make you feel sick after. I'd try brio again! Nice, clean ambiance similar to that of an Olive Garden but still with a casual feel so you don't feel obligated to dress up.",

Finally we happened upon Brio and their wait was over an hour!  We slipped into the bar and as fate would have it a table was getting up to leave right as we walked in!! So we swooped the table like the stealthy women we are and all was right with the world.  We had an amazing server! We had a few drinks and I have to say their Raspberry Mojito is a must try!  We started with the Carpaccio appetizer and it was absolutely heavenly. Like I'm crazing it right now at 8:00AM just writing about it good.  For our main course we had the Steak salad and the Salmon salad. Both were ginormous portions and incredibly tasty. Neither of us were able to finish them and we left incredibly satisfied!  This will definitely be a go to for girls night!",

They were raving about this great pasta spot near the south side of the strip so we decided to stop by here.    I believe Brio is an Italian chain around the US, although I don't believe they have any in the Southern California area; hence, my unfamiliarity.  The decor is actually really nice.  It's more of a nice date place.  They've got a really nice faux Colisseum exhibited in the dining area.  A very nice touch to the restaurant.    I ended up orderering the Pasta Fra Diavolo with chicken.  I thought it was ok.  It didn't really pack the kind of flavor that I was really looking for.  Usually the sauces are exuberant for this type of dish, but this one was a little on the bland side.  The chicken was also forgettable, not really adding much to the dish.  Would I come back to this place?  I'd probably give it another shot and try something else.  There was a nice salmon dish that I saw on someone else's platter that I would have liked to try.",

For my entree I went with the pasta alla vodka and added shrimp it has a nice little spice to it and the pasta was cooked perfectly AL dente  my gf had a mixed seafood pasta dish that I tasted it was also very tasty. One thing I have to say as a downfall was that our waitress seemed to cater to the bigger tables and just check on us when she felt like it but we had a good table convo going so it wasn't that big of a deal. Prices were fair for the food we ate I see a lot of company's about that on here but this is vegas own your wallets people come on. All in all a very nice dining establishment and being in town square would be a really cute date spot for you lovebirds out there.",

    "text": "I am not especially jazzed to be writing a review of Brio as it is more of a chain establishment; however, it has a couple of things going for it that elevate it a couple of inches above Wal-Mart, so I am doing it.  These things are atmosphere and tiny desserts. Let's start with atmosphere: the place is giant and perhaps bordering on tacky, but at least they tried, and they have probably the largest, most impressive patio in Las Vegas featuring not only tables but love seats and plenty of umbrellas. It must be at least a solid two blocks of outdoor experience. Of course, all of this is undermined by the fact that Town Square sits solidly underneath the flat path for McCarran, so every ten minutes you have a 757 flying over and rendering conversation impossible for about a minute. After about 15 minutes of this, my mom commented, \"I hope they got a good deal on this property.\" I would say this makes what could be a five star atmosphere a three star experience, possibly even two if you are sensitive to jet engines.  Yet, they have one more trick up their patio: tiny desserts. Really, this is a brilliant idea, and I am not sure why more restaurants do not do this. Brio offers six miniature desserts. They come in what is best described as a sweet shot glass, which is probably the volume of 3 shot glasses. Each mini-sweetie only costs $2.45! My mom and I had the Peachberry Crostada topped with pecan streusel, vanilla bean gelato and Melba sauce. My mom wanted to order five more, and I can't blame her.  We both had salad and soup for our lunch, and those were done well. They also have a nice happy hour, but you have to sit at the bar to get those deals. I recommend just creating your own secret happy hour: grab a table on the patio and order $2.45 desserts until your sweet tooth begs for mercy. It's a good plan.",

I feel this  may be my most ambivalent review yet but I am just not moved emotionally either way on Brio. I will go pro vs con and see if that helps.  Pro . Nice beef carpaccio  con. Not many anti-pasta you would expect. Marinated Veg, Charcuterie, or maybe roasted carciofi  pro. Nice size pasta bowl  con. Although I love Ricotta and Vodka sauce this dish was a little  blah.  pro. Outdoor seating  con. chair was so tight and uncomfortable I found myself fidgeting the whole time pro. Cold Peroni and glass con. Dirty glass pro. location is very convinent con. Chain(BBRG) I am gonna go with 3 strong stars just can't go 4 on this one.",

Town Square is such a great place to walk around and shop and then to stop here and have a bite to eat of some bueno Italian food with a beer or a glass of wine is a great way to top off the night unless you go see a movie afterward which is great too.  I like to sit outside and enjoy the Vegas summer night and watch people walk around as they go in and out of stores while I eat my food. If it's to hot outside the inside is very well designed and looks extremely fancy with good A/C and it's not as expensive as it looks like it should be.",

There are times when I have been here where the food and the service is just not up to par and the last time I was here, was not any different.     I brought my sister here for her birthday dinner. We decided to sit outside since they had the misters outside turned on to cool things down a bit. We didn't order any appetizers but we decided to get drinks. The peach and raspberry sangria with moscato in it not only looked good but it was very refreshing. My sister ordered the shrimp risotto and I ordered the angel hair pasta with pesto sauce and shrimp. The risotto dish seemed fine, each dish had jumbo shrimp in it but my pasta was dry and had little to no sauce on it.      In the middle of our dinner, the restaurant decided to turn the misters off, even though it was only 7:30. At that point, it just got too hot and uncomfortable to even enjoy our meal. We were just ready to go but our waiter seemed really busy so we just sat out there in heat waiting for him to come by with our check.      May be next time I come here, I will sit inside so I am not melting in the heat and can try to enjoy my meal.",

Also, another thing I love about this place is their chocolate mints haha I think it's so much better than olive garden too.   The staff here can also be a bit slow and lazy. Because every time i come here and there are empty plates on the table, the server would not pick it up unless we handed them the plate ourselves. It's a bit obvious that we're done with the plate when there's nothing left on the plate",

I started my meal with the lobster bisque which was excellent.  For my entree I have mushroom stuffed raviolis, very delicious. For desert my girl friend and I tried the creme brulee trio (Vanilla, Carmel & Hot Chocolate). I must say that even though it was nice to try the different flavors I am still a big fan of the plain vanilla creme brulee.   The overall experience was terrific and plan on returning.",

(I'm going to rewind about an hour into our dining there was a birthday party in front of or table. About 4 waiters sang happy birthday and lit the birthday dessert as well as clapped and celebrated which is what I've always been accustomed to when parties are being celebrated at restaurants). Proceeding with our dining it was time to celebrate our birthday boy with the same song and excitement.  1. Our waiter LIED and said the restaurant DOES NOT SING HAPPY BIRTHDAY TO GUESTS.  2. THEY BROUGHT OUT HIS CUPCAKE, QUIETLY SO PPL AT THE OPPOSITE END OF THE TABLE DIDN'T EVEN REALIZE IT HAD BEEN BROUGHT OUT. The reason this irritates me is don't lie to me after I just witnessed your courtesy to other patrons and don't hush hush a celebration that was shared at your establishment.  3 stars because the food was good.. took long to come out though.  No refills on drinks,  waiter seemed overwhelmed and irritated.. felt rushed out even though people were still ordering desserts.. I won't be back.",

    "text": "Wow.  What a nice surprise.   My husband and I were vacationing in Vegas and were sick of the constant stimulus of the strip.  This place was recommended for a quiet meal with a romantic vibe.  Let me tell you--Service is important to those who've worked in the service industry. (I used to be a waitress. I know how hard the job is!)  Boy, did we get blessed.  Tamara was our server.  Her bubbly and genuine smile really stood out from the glazed and frozen grins we were starting to get used to.  My husband ordered the salmon salad and said it was a large but perfectly filling light meal. Tamara dealt with my modifications to their Garden Salad and handled it like a CHAMP! The grilled chicken added to salad was so juicy!  It definitely wasn't some 'garbage' chicken that couldn't be used in another dish. (Again, I know how restaurants work...)  Tamara  wasn't miffed that we weren't drinking and ordered Pelligrino. But, THIS is Vegas and she did tempt my husband to stumble...off his low-carb diet!  Per Tamara's suggestion, John ordered the light cheesecake bite AND the peanut butter cup. (When he falls off the bandwagon...forget about it!) He said Tamara's taste buds were right on the money KA-CHING! Her cheesecake won top billing.  If we lived in Vegas I could definitely see us coming here a lot.  In fact, every time we stop by Sin City, we will be nabbing a table here.   Great job, Tamara. You made this incredible restaurant an experience we will definitely remember. With a smile and attitude like that, the world is your oyster!",

The restaurant was not busy this particular Sunday night, but reservations are recommended. We were quickly served hot bread and butter which was a good start because I was starving!  Our server was nice, but she was inconsistent. After she took our orders, we hardly saw her again. Someone else brought our dinner to the table, and we were all shocked that they didn't offer cheese. This is supposed to be an Italian place right?? We had to wait a while for our server to come back and check on us and then we were able to ask for fresh parmesan. After that, we hardly saw her again except when it came time to drop off the check. Even after that, she disappeared for a good 20 minutes and we needed some things on our bill adjusted so we finally had to flag someone down to ask them to tell our server to come back to the table.   The food, meh, nothing special and surely over priced. I went with the chicken under the brick, which is a grilled chicken breast with marsala mushroom sauce, served with mashed potatoes and veggies. The marsala sauce was really good, I just wish there were more of it. I loved the vegetables that came with my meal especially the carrots, they were a tad sweet so I think they might have been glazed. I also ordered a side chopped salad which was just okay as well. For each side salad it was $4.95! That is for lettuce, a few chopped veggies, and dressing. The bill for just me and my mom was $54! Other people in my party agreed the food was just okay and definitely overpriced. I hear they have a good happy hour, I wouldn't go out of my way to come back here, but I wouldn't be opposed to trying the happy hour.",

    "text": "Review is for happy hour at the bar only. I've been to Brio a couple years ago and although its a beautiful place, the food was forgettable. Better than olive garden, but what isnt? Today was my first time there for happy hour and I may become a regular.   No drink specials except $5 martinis on Thursdays, but their cocktails are pretty reasonable. However they have one of the best food specials - a nice variety of things for $2.95. We went with the beef carpaccio, pepperoni sausage flat bread, brio burger and shrimp cocktail. I didn't expect much for the price, so it was a pleasant surprise that all of the food was a good sized portion and plated nicely.   Carpaccio was fresh and served with some greens on top - so perfect for a summer evening on the patio. Burger looked like those preformed Costco patties but it was cooked perfectly medium and yummy with a soft tasty bun. Flat bread was the perfect size for two and the dollops of I'm guessing goat cheese? on each piece was a great finish. Shrimp cocktail wasn't a typical cocktail - cocktail sauce on the bottom with tossed romaine and 4 or 5 ok sized shrimp on top. Everything in it was fresh and good. I'm betting it's a lot better than that sketchy 99cent shrimp cocktail downtown.   My friends white peach sangria was a little sweet, I loved my strawberry basil lemonade (non alcoholic). There were some issues with the bill re the drinks, but the manager was quick to take care of it. Service at the bar was pretty great - bartender was attentive, everything came out quickly. The manager seemed very hands on. He kept making sure we were ok, that our food was coming and immediately corrected the bill.   I may have to try Brio for lunch or dinner again soon. Hopefully that experience will be as good as today's.",

I have a mixed bag rating for this place...there were things I did like: bread basket (flax seed crackers were good), calamari and white sauce and then things I didn't: turkey sandwich (see pic), chop salad (pic)......for your bday you get a very tiny dessert (very tiny like espresso shot cup size) - it was ok. Overall it was ok but I wouldn't rush back to eat there. Service was fine, nothing to brag about.  Honestly the best thing there was the flax seed crackers lol which was free.....I think is recommend eating there for HH instead of paying full price for their food.",

Every time I have visited this establishment, the food has always been great along with the drinks,  My favorite by far is the chicken limone, the pasta is nicely seasoned and I LOVE capers!  All the flavors are nicely pulled together and it is delightful as leftovers too!  And their white peach sangria can rival Firefly's sangria...lol.    It's also a great place to gather with friends, as the patio gives you an opportunity to people watch and they have a few fire pits outdoor to keep you warm while chatting and drinking.  I definitely encourage people to swing by and enjoy the food and atmosphere.",

Since then, when there is a Brio near where I'm going, I always make reservations.    This is the 2nd time I went to Brio at this shopping center.  1st time was OK except when I ordered a glass of house Cabernet and have to ask 2 times and never got.  When I was charged, the waiter asked if I wanted to take my wine to go.  I thought really????  Wine to go???  I told the waiter to just cancel the wine and give me a new bill.   My daughter and I ordered the following:  Glass house Malbec ($10): if they are going to serve a glass of wine, either serve it 1/2 the glass or serve it in smaller wine glasses.  See my picture, I got 1/4 glass.  Caesar salad ($5) - it didn't come with parmesan cheese.  who serves a Caesar salad with no parmesan cheese????  I had to ask for cheese twice.   Campanelle Carbonara pasta ($20) - This is my all time favorite.  It comes with spinach, chicken and bacon.  I wanted to go vegetarian so I substituted the chicken and bacon with mushrooms. It was still really good.   My daughter got the kids rigatoni with meat sauce ($7).  My daughter really liked it.   I will definitely go back again but don't order wine and make sure that they put cheese on the Caesar salad.",

Yesterday when I ordered it there were literally 3 pieces of shrimp, that's more than half the portion missing (it's no wonder I left hungry). Now instead of giving us a full size flatbread, they cut a few pieces and lay it on the plate. Check my before and after pics. You don't think your loyal frequent customers would notice?  It's a shame, this spot used to be the best happy hour imo, now it's off the list.",

Add beautiful servers and an outdoor garden with a misting system and I'm in heaven. I started with a very generously poured Crown Royal. As the food arrived, i was blown away.   The Filet Mignon Carpaccio was on this gigantic platter and was over the rim with delicate slices of perfectly spiced filet. The Caprese Salad is not on the menu, but order it! Absolutely yummy with a crazy good balsamic drizzle. The Seafood Farfalle was cooked to perfection. The Lobster Bisque was creamy and had chunks of lobster. The Steak Medallions with Gorgonzola Crisps were over the top delicious.   Beautiful decor, fantastic food, great prices, excellent service and a misting system earn my 5 Stars!",

(I had attended a private event there last year.  There was a buffet of simple items, such as fruit, cheese, etc.)  Anyway, I was completely unaware her intent was to avail ourselves to the happy hour specials.  I had sat in the main dining room and had already ordered a glass of Pinot Grigio.  The waiter checked with the manager and she was kind enough to offer us the specials.    To be honest, the HH specials didn't do it for me.  I ordered the pasta brio.  First, I knew when I got it that I would get to take home about half and enjoy for lunch the next day.  It was delicious!  Grilled chicken, mushrooms, rigatoni...I'm not sure what be sauce was, but it was tasty!  Also, let me give props to my super waiter.  He got me my wine and a glass of water before my friend arrived.  He also brought bread with oil, balsamic, and Parmesan cheese.    My friend enjoyed her hh of shrimp and an inexpensive wine.    Great balance to our evening!",

This made for some interesting dinner conversation, to say the least, and the staff seemed to handle her well. Their effort was certainly better than I could have ever attempted! I came to the conclusion throughout dinner that our waiter was not supposed to be taking care of our section but was just picking up the slack for another waiter or trying to get some extra tables. Even despite this, I am certain I will be back.  First off, the bread is sourdough! Any restaurant that has a default option of sourdough bread, sign me up because sourdough bread is so yummy! I had the lobster & shrimp fettucini while my guest had a chopped salad. The other reviews don't lie when they praise the chopped salad here! The shrimp and lobster pasta was as good as any I have ever head but still when I come back I think I will order a chopped salad. On the menu it is $5 and comes as a side, so maybe order two and ask them to combine it into a bowl. I am honestly surprised there is no entree option for this salad but I guess most people don't come to an Italian restaurant to have their cheapest salad option. It is that good though, so do yourself a favor and order it!",

The two salads that we ordered, Kale Cesar Salad and Steak salad are both excellent! The chef pulled out all the stops with the salads alone.  The Pasta Alfredo is one of the tastiest that I've had and I am an Alfredo pasta girl. I recommend this Alfredo to everyone! Go and enjoy it.  The ambiance of Brio is very intimate and it's pretty casual. There was a lot of Christmas parties happening when we ate there today which made the place have a festive vibe.  Two thumbs up to Brio and I recommend this place to everyone to try out.",

Food selection is plenty even if you are vegetarian, pescatarian, carnivore, whatever over acting wanna be healthy not really you are... there is a food item here for you. Okay... ambiance haaaa, good vibe. And there are plenty of wine and cocktails to choose from too. You can burn everything you eat afterwards by walking around the shops in the area. I recommend this place. Happy Italian eating nom noms! :)",

    "text": "How good is the Wednesday happy hour at Brio, good enough for us to stop by twice our 2-week vacation.  Cocktail pricing at 1/2 off was the enticement, what got us to return proved to be the quality and variety of the cocktails.  On the first visit my wife ordered the tropical cosmo (pineapple infused vodka, Malibu coconut rum, cranberry and lime juices) followed by a razzertini (raspberry vodka, black raspberry liqueur, lime juice and simple syrup.  I took a different path to bliss by ordering a traditional cosmo followed in short order by a flirtini (raspberry vodka, orange liqueur, cranberry and pineapple juices topped off with Prosecco).  One week later we were seated at the same bar with my wife sipping another razzertini that was followed by the house cabernet sauvignon.  I again chose to vary my drinks by ordering a Moscow mule followed by a lemontini (SVEDKA citron vodka, orange liqueur and sweet & sour).  The razzertini graduated magna cum laude while the Moscow mule was sent to the dean's office for not including muddled basil.  On each of our visits we shared an order of calamari that included fresh arriabiata and a lemon aioli for dipping.",

This is fine as the menu is quite large but I'd like to at least have my drink order placed especially on a Sunday when I want a latte and they say that it takes extra long to get it.     I'm gluten free and they have a gluten free menu which is great but it was very disappointing as it had about 3 items on it.   I know if I come back here I'll just end up \"cheating\" and taking benadryl because it's very slim pickings.  I will say that the gluten free pasta was very delicious and cooked very well.   I'd rank it a bit higher if the service was better.   I really really hate waiting and waiting.",

He was very accommodating, patient, and great with his recommendations (the eggplant/shrimp was sooooo good)!   The location is great too, feels very fancy but welcoming. You can either dine inside or outside depending on the weather.   The only thing I wish they would change is the complimentary bread coz it lacked a little bit of flavor and it wasn't warm, plus the butter they served was cold so it was a bit disappointing trying to spread some on the bread. I prefer a side of good olive oil and balsamic vinegar as opposed to cold butter.",

    "text": "Brio is a nice Italian restaurant in the heart of Town Square. The prices are affordable and comparable to any other chain restaurant found at a mall such as Cheesecake Factory. I like that they offer a number of gluten-free options including their pasta. The restaurant itself is huge with a nice high ceiling. Service was prompt and our waitress checked in on us frequently.  Lunch started off with a couple of appetizers including the beef carpaccio and calamari fritto misto. Although the carpaccio color appeared on the paler side, the actual beef mixed with greens, capers, and mustard aioli tasted delicious. I was disappointed that the calamari was on the soggier side. We were served the standard bread and Parmesan crisps, but I was annoyed by the ice cold and rock hard butter, which has always been a major pet peeve of mine.   Lunch specials included a two course meal featuring a soup or salad plus a pasta dish. I got the lobster bisque, which was good, but on the salty side. I had a feeling that it was mostly filled with the shrimp to cover up for the lack of lobster meat. Nonetheless, it was a nice excuse to eat more bread. For my pasta dish, I got the campanelle carbonara. The plate was less than a full entree, but by that time I was getting pretty full. For drinks, they don't carry any beer on draft.  Although, I wasn't super impressed with the food, given the service, space, and prices, Brio is pretty fancy for a mall restaurant and a nice fit for Town Square.",

I would give 5 starts if the salmon salad I had was better. The salmon portion was delicious. However, the salad portion needs some changes... for one, the asparagus still has its stalks and therefore you had to spit out chunks of the end instead of being able to consume it whole. The salad was also a bit mushy... I'm not sure how to change this, but if it can be done, I would highly recommend it. And lastly, the forks can use an upgrading. I was thankful to have an extra fork to use when the first one felt as though the prongs were bent in different ways... unfortunately, the second was similar in fashion although not as severe.  That being said, the atmosphere was great! We'll be back and I'd love to try a different dish.",

I normally visit during their happy hour (M-F, 4pm to 6pm) when their prices and portions are quite generous. Here is my happy hour breakdown.  Ambiance: High energy and BUSY!! Their bar area is spacious but plan on waiting for a table if you are not there right at 4pm.   Service: Fast and friendly... The way it should be!   Food: AMAZING! Their $3.95 dishes are tasty and come in large portions. Do not leave their happy hour without trying their burger or the shrimp and eggplant dish... You will be sure to love them!  Drinks: The mojitos and sangrias are awesomely refreshing... Depending on the bartender. I wish they were more consistent with their flavor profile and alcohol content of their cocktails. In fact, their drink unpredictability is why I give them 4 stars.   I will most definitely visit again and again!",

Let me guess...they assigned another waiter to the patio? Anyway, the bruschetta was good, the steak in the steak salad was a little wanting, and the waiter needs a little more training: I asked for Chenin Blanc.

(Just a little side info: the pager that they give you to tell you that your table is ready will work across the way at Victoria Secret!)  Once we sat down, we were greeted by our server who immediately asked what we wanted for drinks.  Although it wasn't listed on the menu, they offer a carafe of mimosas.  When we asked the server about it, she wasn't sure if they do that and had to go and check if that was possible.  The server returned saying that it was possible and she told us that it would be $18.  We felt like that was a better deal amongst the 2 of us.  One glass of mimosa was already $6.  The carafe ended up being 2 and a half glasses each!   I ordered the open faced chicken avocado omelet and my friend ordered the ravioli di bello. Since we came for brunch, I decided on a brunch dish, but was also interested in the ravioli.  My friend beat me to it!  While we were waiting for the food, bread and butter was brought out to the table. The food itself was delish although I wished that I had gotten the ravioli di bello! The flavors in that was amaze! It made my chicken avocado omelet seem a bit bland.",

    "text": "I've ordered takeout from here twice now and both times have been full of noms. However, it's a little pricey for my expectations--I don't think they are probably using any higher quality ingredients than Macaroni Grill, Olive Garden, or Maggiano's, but it seems to be quite a bit more expensive.  Yesterday I had a lunch combo... a half salad and a small portion of risotto. The risotto was really great with a lot of veggies (squash, asparagus, tomatoes) and pine nuts. What's not to love about that? The side caesar was good too, and the combination of the two filled me up without being too heavy of a lunch (even though it was a generous portion of creamy risotto!).   I would love to go back and not have it for takeout--I'd like to experience the food fresh out of the kitchen instead out of plastic to-go boxes. However, it is a good option for takeout in Town Square!",

    "text": "We came on the evening of Black Friday - there was a 20 minute wait for the indoor seating but they could seat us right away outdoors. We were hungry so we chose to brave the elements. It was a bit chilly - to be certain. We were glad for our jackets and I ordered a hot chocolate.  The decor was nice, outdoor tables could maybe use a few more heaters on the cold evenings. We loved the idea of the fire pit though it's not super comfortable for dining - better for drinks/appetizers I suspect.  We started with the ravioli appetizer. It was quite good, though perhaps could have used just a tad more tomato/marinara sauce.  I ordered the steak and I have to say it was one of the best steaks I've ever had. Perfectly cooked, much larger than I expected, perfectly seasoned.  Nicely done sides of mashed potatoes and vegetables.  Really outstanding. The rest of the table seemed to enjoy their dishes as well.  Service was friendly, professional and attentive.  He made a small mistake on the check in not crediting our free appetizer coupon but immediately recognized and fixed it with an apology.    The only downside I can think of was it being a bit chilly, but we can't fault Brio for the weather. Look forward to going back on our next trip to Vegas.",

    "text": "Brio Brio Brio.... I have gone here a ton of times.  So this is a general review of multiple experiences.  1. Good food, lets get things straight I keep going back because of the food location and people watching, the service is at best mediocre and at worst it just plain sucks.  Flatbread - quite good Fish specials - Good (usually go for this at lunch) Chicken under a brick - bad should be left under the brick and kicked to the curb Pizza - good (if you like thin crust stuff, i prefer just going to the flatbreads though) Lamb - I like pink lamb I have had to send back as ultra rare lamb is not to my taste, beef yes lamb ultra rare no Deserts are good I link the sampler (see service below)  i like the ambiance of this place for sitting outside and people watching, there arent enough decent al fresco dining places in vegas (because it gets hot) however it is too big.  Been there a lot and have never been remembered because i rarely have seen the same server twice.  Wait staff seems to be overworked and under-crewed so I never take it out on my servers (tip wise), however I have had to complain about wait times and am usually rewarded with free desert to the table which i usually get the sampler which is quite tasty and varied the apple crumble is very good.  Price to food quality is a very good ratio. Overall it is a decent restaurant,  if you are tight on time, it would be  a no go.  However for extended lunches (booze helps deal with longer wait times) it is a go to place.  Just if the service is slow dont be scared to notify people you are waiting and furthermore dont hesitate to take it out on the manager and not the overworked servers who are really trying their best with what looks like understaffing decisions.  Overall a 3 star would be 4 if their service gets a revamp.",

Whenever family or friends come to town with a large group, or when there is a birthday dinner, we include Brio on the list of eats.   First off, you can do call-ahead-seating. Bonus. Especially for a group of 12+, which was our case the other night. Shotgun wedding at The Little White Chapel, then down to Brio for some celebratin'! LOL.   The prices are very reasonable if you consider the competition and what you get. Yes it's a \"chain\" but c'mon, we're on a budget, we like to drink wine (by the bottle) and there were a ton of us! Also it's not overly chained AND they only do Italian restaurants. Bonus.   Ok so what to get:   Lobster Bisque Soup  Artichoke Dip  Lobster Ravioli  Sweet Potato and Chicken Risotto  Fettuccine Napoli  Grilled Salmon  Entree Salad - Steak Salad  Add on either the Caesar, the Wedge or the Brio salad to your pasta dish...they are all great!  Dessert - get a variety of the little servings. YUM!   If you are coming with just a few or alone, I recommend trying the Bar during happy hour. There are some pretty good \"bar bites\" deals.",

I really wanted to address this with Brio and not the rest of the world, but with no response whatsoever, here I go. I had brunch a month back, and ordered the eggs, home fries, and bacon. It says it comes with brioche toast on the menu. It does not. After addressing this with the waitress, the manager comes over. He stands there for a little while (very awkward) before finally asking what the issue was. Wasn't sure if he was waiting for me to say something first? Anyhow, he told me they don't have or have ever had brioche toast, and I asked him why the menu says they do? He says he doesn't print the menus and that corporate does. Wow!! I couldn't believe his answer! Maybe the correct answer should have been, \"You know you're right, it must be a misprint, I should let corporate know.\" It's very deceptive to advertise brioche toast to people and then serve crappy white stale toast. I rarely bring up anything I am displeased with at a restaurant, but this was Brio's third strike with me. The last time it was a cold omelette that I didn't say anything about. I wanted to give Brio another chance since I have been going here since the opening, (and their eggplant shrimp appetizer is actually pretty amazing), but three strikes and you're out.",

I'm usually pretty skeptical with Italian food in general because I'm allergic to gluten and can't eat much...but I figured I could find something to  suit me.  Loved it here. It's located in this high end outdoor mall (which we didn't see too much of, thanks to scorching Vegas weather...) and the restaurant itself is beautiful. I loved the building with it's high ceilings & open space. I made me feel like I was dining in a castle :)  It was still a little early for dinner (about 5:30), so we were seated right away, although we had no reservations. We were given a bread basket with some flatbread crisps to munch on while we were looking over the menu. I didn't try any of it, but my mom & uncle said the bread was yummy. I ordered the sweet potato & chicken risotto and a  salad, my mom ordered a flatbread pizza and my uncle got the crab cakes. We all decided to share the spinach artichoke dip as an appetizer.  The salad was amazing. Best cesar salad I've had, and I've had quite a few in my time. The dressing wasn't too salty...and the tanginess was perfection. The dip was a bit too salty for me...but I tasted a little bit of the parmesan crisps that come with it & they were great.   When my food arrived it was very pretty :) The risotto wasn't gummy (which is usually the case) and the flavor was great...but I was a little weirded out because they used dark meat chicken. There were ligaments still attached, like they used a chicken leg instead of a chicken breast. Not that there's anything wrong with that, I am just used to seeing white meat used, as opposed to dark. It tasted fine, tho...I took it all in stride.  I ordered a creme brulee for dessert and it was pretty good. Not the best, but definitely up there.  All in all, the ambiance was nice & the waitress was very friendly. We had a good time here. I'm don't usually visit lavish restaurants when we're in Vegas, but I'd definitely give this place a try again. I'd love to try some pasta here, but I really would hate to land myself in the hospital...",

Since we had waited a while to be seated, we tried to give the server our appetizer order right away, but she didn't want that.  Then, only when she came back later to take our order did she tell me the item I had ordered was out.  That felt a little like a waste of time, because now I need to read the menu again. Since we were seated by the open kitchen, I saw our lunches come up, but our server was sitting down with the table next to us while our food waited under a heat lamp.  That probably didn't make much difference though as it was extremely unexceptional.  I tried half of the chicken club and half of the burger.  The bottom bun on the burger fell apart after a few bites - big burger sin! The chicken club was dry and both sandwiches had components listed on the menu - balsamic onions and roasted tomato mayo, that sounded great, but were lost in the final result.",

Our hostess, immediately gathered and picked up the extra table settings in Lightning Speed and then handed our menus. WOHO! No more than 30 seconds our Server comes over and hands us the menu with a big smile and takes our drink orders. No more than a minute, a food runner brings us our drinks.

I loved the peperoncini mixed with the squid. Once in a while I would pick one up to spice it up a bit! Or sometimes it was a spicy surprise! Breading wasn't real golden brown and crispy. Came with 2 sauces on each side -Red sauce/Marinara type and Yellow sauce/Garlic Aioli. Red sauce typical pasta pizza sauce flavored. On the other hand, the Garlic Aioli was Absolutely Divine!! I don't know if its just me but that flavor got my attention real quick! It had a distinct flavor and a hint of horseradish mustard something that I couldn't get enough of! I didn't want to look like a dog but I would of Licked that plate clean with a shine!   Spicy shrimp & Eggplant: Nice presentation, came on a long rectangle plate all lined up like in a straight line. Overall, flavor wasn't really impressive more disappointing if anything. The black pepper cream sauce wasn't as good as it sounded but the romano crusted egg plant was nice. Basically, after a few pieces, I was over it.. I guess that's why its an appetizer! But this felt heavy and after a few, I threw in the towel..  Entree:  Pasta Pomodoro with Chicken and added their Bistecca Insalata (salad): Another Heavy Weight plate, a generous mound of angel hair pasta, grilled chicken, pine nuts and their cilantro pesto drizzle. Plus some grated parmesan on top. Pretty straight forward dish and pretty good as well. It was just lacking 5 Stardom calibur, just like every other dish.. (Except for the salad, I'll get to that!).  *Bistecca Insalata: The Freshest Wedge of Iceberg Lettuce (crisp and almost neon green), Gorgonzola, real pieces of bacon (not dried bits), shiny red roma tomaotes and their mouthwatering creamy parmesan dressing!! One of the Best salads I've ever sunk my teeth in!!  Couldn't help but watch some of the staff really get to work. During our meal, we couldn't help but notice a vacant table behind us that was getting set for the next guest(s). The busser/server assistant was so precise and jaw dropping fast! I mean like watching a dvd and pressing forward like 3 times/3 arrows!! Just like everybody else here!! It's like the In N' Out Burger staff on a Redbull High!!! Also, I must mention our (Pregnant) Server did not skip a beat from refilling drinks, stopping by to check on the dinner status, to adding the extra Garlic Aioli sauces in our staff wrapped doggie bags! Service 5.5 Screaming Stars! Taste of Food 3.5-4 Stars (Bistecca salad 5+ stars), Value for amount of food 4-4.5 Stars and Ambiance 4.5 Stars..",

    "text": "Mmm. Brio.  I am so addicted to their Crab and Shrimp Crab Cakes, it's ridiculous. Personally, I like to get the appetizer size (two GIGANTIC crab cakes) and then add my own side of asparagus - which they do just right there.   If I really want to go crazy, I'll get the Spinach Artichoke Dip that comes served with their Cheese Crisp Flatbread as an appetizer.   And if I really, really want to go crazy - I will add a Bellini to all that action.   Brio has never let me down. It's got a great location, right smack in the middle of Town Square. If the weather is nice, have a seat out on the patio for some great people watching.   I have taken my parents here - I've been on a date here - I've been on a Girl's Night Out here - it's just a CROWD PLEASER. Every dish is delicious and the service is always on point.  I hear they are opening over at Tivoli Village come Spring 2011. A Summerlin location would be fab for those of us who have to make the trek out to Town Square to get there otherwise.",

It wasn't anything special but I know experience wise, Brio is one of the best and most popular places in Town Square. It's been more than a year until I heard about the happy hour. Their bar happy hour features $5 drinks and $3.99 items. I went with the chips and burger and for that price you can't go wrong!  They also have shrip, ravioli and another 5 or so items on the happy hour menu starting at 9PM. Ill definitely be back soon!",

She seated us right away after verifying our reservation.     I really enjoy the ambiance of this restaurant. They have both outdoor seating and indoor booth/table seating. It has high ceiling and private room area for small parties. It gives guests an European feeling which is hard to find here in Vegas.     As for the service, I can only give 2 stars max, Our server is very nice and he seems to know a lot about the dishes but he does not check back with us often enough to make sure we are ready to order and we are satisfied with our food. As a matter of fact, we had to get someone to get him to take our order. Same situation with the water too, we always have to look for someone.     We ordered two dishes and shared, Crispy Eggplant Pomodoro and Mezza Chicken Limone. The Eggplant is dry and the sauce has nothing special, while the Mezza Chicken is juicy and tasty. Probably not going to order the Eggplant Pomodoro next time.    I saw a lot of good review in regard of happy hour at this place, Would love to give it a try.",

    "text": "Me and two girlfriends were out and about in Vegas this past weekend and after all the window shopping we had done, we realized we were famished. So we drove and came upon Brio. The first thing out of me and my friends mouth was HAPPY HOUR SPECIALS!!!! See we frequent the Brio in Scottsdale and we love their happy hour special in which a select few of their appetizers are all $2.95. We snag a great parking spot and walk into Brio where the sign says happy hour 3-7 in the bar. SCORE!  We are immediately seated and our waiter comes over to take our drink orders and we say may we also get the happy hour menu. He proceeds to say that happy hour doesn't start until 3:30pm but I say your sign says 3pm.  He proceeds to tell me still needs to be changed but happy hour does not start to 3:30pm. We say fine, we will wait the 20mins until happy hour starts. He proceeds to walk away but what he doesn't realize is that I am still watching him and I swear the look on his face was like these bitches.... So needless to say when he came back I called him out on it. He let me know that if his face conveyed that then he was very sorry and that he apologies for the misunderstanding. Hmm suspect... (however he got back into my good gracious later)  We order Brio Burgers, Ravioli Caprese, Roasted Red Pepper & Fresh Mozzarella Bruschetta and Sliced Steak Bruschetta. Now we have had this before at the Scottsdale Brio and each time the burgers have been perfect and the bruschetta has been divine. This time not so much. The burger was perfect on the inside but burnt on the outside, the Ravioli and all the Brushchetta came out lukewarm at best. Our waiter came over to ask how everything was and I was like eh do you really want to know? So we told him that we weren't happy but we were hungry and we would eat it anyway. He offered to make everything again but we declined as we had already waited for about 30 mins for the food after we ordered. He says I will tell the manager and she may come over to talk to you.  Well the GM came over to talk to us and asked how things were. We told her that we were use to how great everything was at the Scottsdale location and we came here because of that notion and we were disappointed but hey for $2.95 per appetizer, we cannot complain too much. She said that she had just spent a month at the Scottsdale location and this was her first day back and she apologized for the meal and she said she would take care of it for us. We were all like wow, thank you that is very generous. She asked if we wanted anything else and we declined and thanked her again.  Little did we know that when she said she would take care of it for us, she meant the entire bill!! Drinks and all. We asked for the bill thinking we had to at least pay for our drinks and our waiter let us know that the entire bill had been taken care of. WOW! We did leave our waiter a nice tip and left out of there shaking our heads.   So maybe this Brio was having an off afternoon but I give it 1.5 stars for the food but 5 stars for the GM for being extra generous.",

I had the medallions encrusted in artichokes, fresh grilled veggies and yummy mashed taters. I most often alter my mashed but these were so buttery and creamy they didn't even need salt.   My boyfriend had one of the specials for the day. Grilled yellowtail with mashed taters and grilled asparagus. The fish was grilled just perfect and the seasoning was very good.   We also had their signature bruchetta which I am still dreaming about and trying to figure out a way to make it myself since they are not local to me.   I also here they have a great Happy Hour but e were here on a Saturday s we did not partake.",

After the appetizer, we had the grilled salmon and shrimp and crab cakes, respectively. They were very flavorful and filling. Both of us were pleasantly surprised with the speed of service.

I've always had good service here so I have no complaints about that (lets face it, any restaurant can have a bad waiter at any time).  There is patio dining as well which I like because I love to people watch.  It is a little bit pricy, but the food quality is better than most.   All in all Brio is enjoyable.",

Good thing, I was hungry and didnt eat any breakfast, yet. So i ate at least half of my entree, but  after eating all that oily pasta, I wanted to barf.  The salmon was cooked almost perfectly & I enjoyed it.    The waitress was so great, either.  Though she seemed sweet she never came back to check on us and took forever getting the check to us.

Brio Tuscan Grille is at the heart of Town Square, and since it's a ways off The Strip, it's not bustling with tourists. Sitting outside at the bar on a warm Spring afternoon...=) SO PEACEFUL!   BEEF CARPACCIO - This one is my favorite! The meat is sliced super super thin and goes so well with the mustard aioli and field greens.   SLICED STEAK BRUSCHETTA - This one is a close runner up. Some bites you may find the gorgonzola to be overpowering. I think the steak and bruschetta could've done without the cheese. Nevertheless, YUM!   BRIO BURGER - Okay, but kind of dry and plain. Not a fan of the chips it comes with either. Sliced into fours for sharing!  RAVIOLI CAPRESE - Three giant raviolis. Super cheesy and tastes like it was fried. So unless you douse each bite with tomato sauce, it gets dry.  SHRIMPTINI - I was pleasantly surprised with this! The're very generous with the shrimp! Super cute presentation and uber refreshing.  I looked over at the party of 2 sitting right next to us...turns out they ordered the exact same 5 dishes. Must be a good sign! Our waiter also recommended the SPICY SHRIMP AND EGGPLANT, but we didn't have enough stomach room.   Where else can you stuff 2 people with such quality food for less than $20, tax and tip included?! I want to tell all my friends, but at the same time, I want to keep this place all to myself ;)",

I work long  hours and many days of the week and I happened to have some time off to spend with my wife and my 2yr old son. I thought it would be nice to go \"try out the Italian place in Town Square.\" They have outdoor seating and I love Italian food. I have ate at many of the other restaurants there in Town Square but not Brio.  When we get there we asked to be seated outside since that was one of the reasons for choosing the place. We sit and wait a few minutes but not too long for the waiter to come by and take our drink orders. He leaves and is gone for a while but then comes back with waters which we didn't order but that is ok. Still waiting on my beer though. He eventually makes his way back to our table with my beer and takes our orders.   After he leaves I take a nice big drink from my beer to realize the glass is dirty!! Now I'm a aircraft mechanic, I don't mind being dirty and have a certain tolerance for dirty, but when you charge 8 bucks for a beer I would like it in a clean glass or at least one that isn't sticky!!  Now I wait a while for the waiter to come back to let him know the glass is dirty so he can replace it. Once again he finally shows up so i could inform him of the issue. He apologizes and says he will be right back. He does come right back with a new glass and proceeds to pour the beer from the dirty glass to the \"clean\" one. No bullshit. Isn't that like scooping water from the toilet bowl and calling it clean? Needless to say I drank the water.   I ordered one of the 14oz steaks since I was happy to spend time with the family. I ordered it medium because thats the way I like it. However, I got it well done, so well done the edges were burnt to s crisp! You got to be kidding me. A 30 dollar steak that you cooked all the flavor out of! I eat it because I am not the kind of person that will fuss about an overcooked steak only to get a properly cooked steak with spit in it. Especially after the dirty beer incident.   I don't normally turn back food or complain since I am easily pleased but I think for a 100 dollar meal you should be pretty damn happy with all aspects of the service.   I will never go here again! There are plenty of places to eat at Town Square and new ones are opening all the time. I'm hoping soon there will be a new opening in the Brio location.   Do yourself a favor......eat somewhere else.",

    "text": "I never really paid attention until last night while out having dinner with my mom, but Brio is a fantastic blend of Carabas meets Cheesecake Factory.  What does that mean? Fixed menu, factory workers as servers, little intimacy in the entire venue, just get-em in get-em out experience. It's like a production line.. granted most restaurants are but they all don't FEEL that way.  Now, I'm not saying things were bad, my server (forgot his name) was very nice and super attentive, food was good (not great, just good), and over all it was a decent dining experience.  I would chalk this place up as saying it's just another commercial chain food establishment with main perks being their happy hour specials and outdoor seating when the weather is nice.  Sorry Brio, I'm just as disappointed as you are.",

And out of the restaurant choices at town square, Brio is up at the top of the list and definitely not somewhere you should ever avoid (avoid Claim Jumper!).   Brio has wonderful flat breads and bruchetta. Yum. Last night, I ordered the pasta alla vodka and OHMYGOD, I ate the entire plate. Literally, I ate the entire plate. I can't even tell you details about the type of pasta because I shoveled into my mouth so fast that I'm almost in a state of memory failure. All I know is the sauce, the pasta, and the prosciutto were SO DELICIOUS and a must-order if you like vodka sauce.   I also really love the fresh bread they bring to the table, particularly the cheesy cracker-like pieces! YUMMY!   They have a really great selection of desserts too: small ones that allow you to sample many different flavors. I really enjoyed the creme brulee!",

One time we had a woman waiter who was just rude, another time we were sitting outside and a male waiter just couldn't get anything right on our order.

Meals that include the salad are few, but for what it's worth, the chopped salad is incredible!  It's a meal by itself so make sure to share it.

I have been wanting to try this place out, and considering it was our cheat day, I was really excited to have some good pasta. We ordered the caesar salad, lobster bisque, lasagna, the campanelle carbonara, and the tiramisu and some fresh fruit for dessert. The Caesar was okay, lobster bisque was mediocre at best (very generic tasting), my son liked the lasagna, but the carbonara was just waaaayyy too salty. I thought at first that the Parmesan made it salty, but even the pasta in the very bottom of the dish was salty. I literally couldn't eat more than a quarter of the dish because of it. The tiramisu was okay, at least it washed away the saltiness from the pasta dish. I was so bummed because I've been looking forward to coming here, and actually having some good pasta, and just regretted my decision of choosing brio over yard house or bone fish grill. I know this is only our first visit, but I am sort of hesitant to come back here again since they messed up something that was supposed to be a staple of theirs. On the bright side, our server was nice and on top of things so that adds another star to my review.",

Everything was cooked great and tasted amazing except the roasted veggies, they were just blah. Our waiter, Rami, was awesome!! He has a great personality and genuine customer service. He made our entire experience amazing and is the main reason we will start to come to Brio more often! The price isn't too bad considering the amount of food you get. Our meals along with an appetizer and 2 drinks a piece came out to about $120 which was worth it because of the service and the quality of the food. The atmosphere of Brio strikes me as classy but not too classy. You don't need to wear cocktail attire, but you should wear a nice button or polo. It definitely added to the experience.",

Brio is the perfect spot for a date, celebration, or just a good meal.  They have reasonable prices and the food is always good.    I typically always get the sliced steak salad.  It's delicious.  I have gotten the lobster bisque a few times and it's overly salty and doesn't have almost any lobster meat in it.    My friends have gotten several different dishes and always enjoy them.  This past time we had the beef carpaccio which is presented very nicely but it's definitely not the best I've ever had.    A huge plus to me is Brio's loyalty program.  Almost every time I dine here I have a $10 off on my card which is great!  If you don't bring your card they can easily look it up with your phone number as well!  How convenient!  While i'll definitely be back I think they have a few things to improve their overall customer experience.",

This restaurant is plenty large for ample seating and is a very nice ambiance with classy atmosphere, Delicious meal choices and a great selection of wine.  We usually share to avoid over eating and had the shrimp Mediterranean \"specialty\", shared the chopped salad $4.95 entree addition and a 9oz glass of rose.  It was perfect for two! I would certainly return here again if I was in the neighborhood.",

    "text": "I've been here a couple of times, but most recently I ate here for a work dinner. Each time I eat here I am reminded that I shouldn't judge chains so harshly. This one is doing it right with food and service.  Our service was very good, especially for a large group. Our drink orders were taken immediately and brought out quickly. They also did a good job of keeping up with fresh drinks for the heavy drinkers. Our starters came out quickly and meals followed shortly after. Every need was addressed right away by our waitress.   I started with Lobster Bisque and the Chopped Salad. The Lobster Bisque is well flavored and the serving is perfect for a rich bisque. The Chopped Salad has a nice variety of vegetables and black olives with a tangy vinaigrette. I liked that it's chopped for easy eating.   For my main entree I ordered the Pasta Fra Diavolo with Shrimp. There was plenty of large shrimp in the dish and the sauce packed the heat I was looking for in the dish. The portion was plenty. Paired with starters I was only able to eat half and enjoyed the other half for lunch the next day.   All of the dishes ordered at the table looked delicious. The next day everyone discussed how happy they were with their entrees and that we were pleasantly surprised by our Brio experience.",

The food was attractively presented and all of us commented on the more than ample portions. I had the beef salad which was delicious.  The steak was hot off the grill, medium rare and the dressing was not too heavy to weigh down the crispy greens.  Some of my companions ordered the salmon salad which they also said was delicious.  I've been to this restaurant many times and always look forward to the delicious bread basket.  Brio is a go-to restaurant for us when we're in town square.",

Thank goodness we did because the wait would have been over an hour!!  And even with a reservation they sat us 15 mins later.....  We got water and menus promptly and decided to order the pasta tuscano, the vodka pasta, the shrimp and eggplant appetizer and the beef Carpaccio.  Food came out relatively quickly and we got everything at once.  The beef Carpaccio was plated beautifully.  It was in this gigantic plate that took up the whole table space.  Beef was sliced super thin and stuck to the plate.  You can't even pick up a piece of it without tearing.  I don't know if that's good or bad.   But it was delicious and fresh.  The eggplant and shrimp was probably my favorite dish.  A little salty but the eggplant was perfectly fried and crispy.  It was not mushy at all even though it was smothered in sauce.  As for the pastas, the noodles were cooked well.  It wasn't aldente and I actually liked that it was softer.  The tuscano pasta is Bolognese made with sausage instead of beef.  I was disappointed because it tasted overly cheesy and the sausage is overwhelming.  I think I like the original version with beef better.  The vodka pasta was very good.  It was ricotta stuffed pasta in a creamy tomato sauce.  The ricotta was light and airy and the tart tomato sauce balanced it well.  Overall, this is not a place I will come to again on my own.  Its a nice ambiance, but too expensive for the quality of food.  Our waiter was also super FORGETFUL.  Had the ask for water, plate, fork, check TWICE.",

My next complaint was my bloody Mary, I like to have \"a salad\" with my drink. I asked the waitress what came as garnish in the bloody Mary. I was told a cheese and meat roll-up and a peperoncini. When she returned with my order she apologized and said they changed the recipe. It came with an olive, 2 inch celery piece and a lemon. The drink itself was tasty but I would have ordered something different knowing the actual disappointing garnish.  My waitress was fine BTW",

We were seated on one of the high tops in the bar area and had such a good time. Shireen, our server was awesome with the perfect amount of personable customer service.   Happy hour here is legit!   $5 wines, including Pinot and Chardonnay plus some reds (I'm a white drinker, so yeah).   $5 cocktails. (My bad, I forgot to take a picture of the menu).   && a ton of $4-$6 Bar Food Menu items. Our favorites were the black pepper shrimp, we literally ordered 3 orders of this. It's shrimp on eggplant pieces with a nice creamy sauce, with a spicy kick- SO good! We also tried the beef carpaccio- yes RAW beef, thin slices with a hefty salad atop, this was good only $5! We also tried the bruschetta which was accompanied with slices of beef and tomatoes, bomb! Lastly we tried the chicken nachos, meh- pass on these!   Overall - great, great experience! Happy Hour is where it's at! Vibe and ambiance is chill? Don't feel like you need to dress up, it's nothing fancy! Also, a disc jokey pops out of nowhere at 6:30p!!",

We decided after chatting for a bit to get some appetizers. The food for the most part was good. The sauce that the waiter suggested was excellent. That was the last time we saw our waiter. We were looking around for him, our drinks had been empty for awhile needed refills. I finally asked another waiter if he could help us. After some talking he said our waiter had a emergency. Was sorry to hear that. But then who moves and covers our table. Anyway, food was decent, was sat right away, the hosts were pleasant, just fell short a bit on the service. Oh, and they changed the menu which didnt appeal to me so we stuck with the apps.",

The inside restaurant I would say is beautiful and has nice ceiling decorations.. very high and fancy with the long drapes above. Hosts are nice and friendly. ambiance of place is casual but also a upscale feel to it. Pricing isn't too bad as well.   So the last time i was there I ordered a risotto dish with lobster on top!  the presentation of the dish was amazing!! beautifully done ...I adjusted some ingredients on there and they accommodated it all. I also had the crab cakes and it was delishh! the creme brulee was yummy as well! Service by the waiter ..hmm he just doesn't seem interested in serving us.   Another time I came here I ordered a Alfredo pasta with blackened shrimp on the side.. the shrimps were good. BUT the pasta they gave me was DRYER than the desert! I had to wave down the waiter help to ask him for extra alfredo sauce... which he called a manager over and he had it sent out shortly after. Manager was quite accommodating and nice. The waitress we had was OK i suppose but hardly around for service.. we literally would flag down anyone we saw walking by...   Overall what i would say about this restaurant is that the ambiance is nice.. if I'm in the area i would def come back. Food is tasty for the most part.. but service is something I have never been fond of!! hopefully management or corporate can see the review and make sure that the waitstaff IMPROVE on the level of SERVICE they provide for every customer that comes into the place. It seems like they pick and choose who they provide good service to. Smh....",

My marinara sauce was bland. The only thing in it that had flavor was the carrots. So while this is great if you don't have allergies and they did try with the gluten-free menu, it's not good for dairy allergies.",

It's quite disapppointing because it's not busy at all so I was surprised to find service so slow and food to come out cold. And mind you, we go to Brio a lot. At this time, we've been to Brio around 8-10 times now this year. And it's also disappointing because I said that it's my brother's birthday on the reservations and told the hostess and this is the first time we dined there on a special occasion that we didn't get candle on our dessert.  I wonder if it was because of the time that we got there. Maybe there's no manager on site and the staff is slacking. But I've never had this kind of service before. Not going to be coming back any time soon, most especially after 9pm.",

We've also received many from our family because they know we love it.  Unfortunately, we have been noticing a gradual decline in the size of portions and the quality of service. The last two times we went there for dinner were highly disappointing. Both times, one of our dinner items did not arrive with our food. That's two different times in a row! Now, that's bad service no matter how you slice it.  Such a shame. We won't be buying dinner or gift certificates again, but may give the happy hour more tries because we loved that, too.  Really sad to lose our favorite spot. Sigh.",

The wine glass is $5 and it was good to see that they offer more than just the house wine during the happy hour.   The food is simply amazing! I ordered the crispy shrimp (spicy Remoulade, green onions), the margherita dip (four cheese blend, tomato compote, Reggiano, basil, grilled ciabatta) and the black pepper shrimp (romano crusted eggplant, spicy black pepper cream sauce). All three of these dishes were delicious. I would order all three again.   When I visited this restaurant it was a Thursday afternoon. The place was really full and it was difficult to find a table (even at the bar!). Because of how busy it was it was sometimes difficult to get our waitress attention in order to place an order. Even though she was swamped with work she was very friendly.   This is a place I am def coming back. Thank you for the awesome food!r",

The menu features eight different small plates that are tasty and great for sharing. Of course the drink specials are a must as well. I have to say the Ambiance is spectacular. It feels like you're right in Northern Italy and without even leaving the country experience the beauty of Tuscany. Brio took time to decorate using very soft lighting, beautiful flowing fabric adorning the ceiling, and white linen tablecloths at each table. Make sure to use your phone flashlight though because it is quite dim it may be hard to see the menu. I ordered the salmon Fresco which was absolutely Divine and cooked exactly how I asked. The waiter made sure that the chef use olive oil only and not canola. As far as drinks I have to recommend the  you can't go wrong with one of their signatures martinis. Happy hour time is very busy so I suggest you get there early. Sometimes there's even live acoustic performance. Great place to meet friends and socialize.",

She was actually my best friend from 5th grade in California and she moved away when we were in middle school and I hadn't seen her in 14 years! Anywho, she moved to LV last year and when I was in town visiting she hit me up for a mini reunion.   My friend had been to Brio before and she suggest this place for lunch. This place looks really nice! Picture a step up from Cheesecake Factory. I can see a bridal shower or a special event being held here.   I ordered the prosciutto and burrata pizza, it was delicious! For some reason I thought I tasted hints of fruit in the pizza sauce. I liked it though and I would get it again if I ever come back.   We had a wonderful lunch catching up. Service was great, they give you nice warm bread upon seating.   Overall it's a nice restaurant and I would recommend it for a nice lunch or dinner.",

Restrooms were even nice and well cared.  Dinner was my occasion on this evening for trying this restaurant.  FYI The Brio Grill in Vegas is one of the last remaining from a former nationwide presence. There may be one or two others, but probably not as good as this locale.  On with the meal.  Starting out with Lobster Bisq and following with Salmon Fresca rounded out my choices.  The bisq was pretty good but the Salmon was really well done.  No fishy taste to note.  They did have a nice dessert tray but I did not partake on this evening.  Salmon was $24 and bisq was $8.00, so fairly priced.  I give it 5, but actually I'm being generous.   If possible, 4.5 would be closer to my experience.",

I usually have the hardest time choosing a place to eat but though it's been awhile since I've had Italian food.  We get to Brio right around lunch time and get seated quickly, we literally had a round table which seats 5-6 ppl just for the two us! They were very fast at seating people which was good cause you could see they were good with getting people in and out. It's been awhile so when I saw the menu it was limited. One side was the food and the other side your alcoholic beverages.   We decided to order a lemonade and a mango iced tea, both very refreshing. They give you an appetizer once you are seated of their flatbread and hot bread, very good! We ordered the spinach artichoke dip for an appetizer, also warm and delicious! For our entrees, my girlfriend ordered a chicken pesto club sandwich and I ordered a cheese tortellini in vodka sauce! I have to say both were pretty good! I just wish I had more of that tortellini!!!",

I had expected to eat my normal kale caesar salad (which was always amazing) and a pasta dish.   Come to find out, their menu was completely changed two months ago.  A server stated they have received many complaints of popular items that were removed. - Disappointing.   Our server Juan was kind when spoken to; didn't have much knowledge of the menu, did not greet our table but instead only approached to collect orders, and also \"misunderstood\" two of the three orders placed. One guest in our party even pointed to the menu item he wanted, Juan shook his head in agreement, yet still delivered the wrong item. Another guest didn't receive her order because Juan didn't write it down! She only received her starter salad, then Juan walked over 10 or so minutes later stating it was his fault and he assumed she didn't want her entree anymore!! WHAT?!  Each item ordered was bland and of smaller portion than previous visits.  The female manager even delivered the missing meal but wasn't very receptive. We had observed her the entire night, she only stayed by the front reception or bar, hiding away from treating tables.   Needless to say we will not be returning. This was my honest review of this poorly run establishment.  Please save your money and go elsewhere.   This is VEGAS, you can pay the same amount of money or LESS and find amazing house-made food with proper and attentive service.",

I was pretty clear to the hostess originally of the name I was looking for, and I'd be at the bar if they arrived.  I wasn't rude, I understood there had to have been some miscommunication somewhere, and would she please alert me if someone else from our party showed up so I could greet them.  From the bar, you can't easily see the hostess station...  Sigh...anyways, while at the bar, I was greeted warmly and the service was superb...the table for 18 was placed in the middle of the main dining area, which was fine, but we'd been assured there would be a private space for our group.  Guess we got outbid by a larger group?  Anyways, not trying to be picky, but when I know this will be at least a $500 tab, I expect to be treated accordingly!!    The food server(s) tho made up for the initial impression...and that's the best part of this review!  The food wasn't what I felt to be any better than Olive Garden, and I'd actually have preferred the food there?  Go figure!  We ordered appetizers, not impressed with the lobster bisque, the roasted garlic spinach artichoke dip, or the breads....so, bring on the salad....I had a house salad, which sounded pretty amazing as described by the food server, but was a disappointment when I got it, and I know the feeling was mutual with the other salad that was ordered too.    Main course, we had some lasagna orders, some veal marsala orders, some carbonara orders, and some other pasta dishes that I couldn't discern....no one from our group was impressed, and we're not foodies or culinary school graduates or anything, so that's saying a LOT about the quality of the food....it was filling!!    Personally, I don't think I'll be going back, but I wouldn't say no to a date taking me there....I'll just know not to expect to be WOW'ed by the food, and just enjoy the atmosphere!!",

    "text": "For happy hour, it is one of the best in Town Square. Monday-Friday 3:30-6:30 and Monday-Thursday 9-close. They have a set menu of certain appetizers for $2.95. A few of these dishes will make for a perfectly good meal. The special is only good for the bar and it is first come, first serve. Since the weather is getting chillier, it is easy to get a seat on the outdoor side. They close the curtains and turn on heat lamps, so it is not bad.  The offerings consist of Beef Carpaccio, Spinach Artichoke Dip, two styles of Flatbread, Fried Raviolis (3 large pieces), a Burger (cut into quarters for sharing), Spicy Shrimp with Eggplant, and Shrimptini (Shrimp Cocktail). The carpaccio was my favorite and so inexpensive.The burger was also good. It is very simple, topped with cheese and a special sauce with a few chips. I usually like mine with all sorts of veggies, but this was nothing to frown upon. The raviolis were the last item I had ordered and they were decent. Getting three of these dishes makes for a perfect dinner and will cost less then $10.   I looked at the rest of their regular menu and many of the pastas were cream based or had it as a listed ingredient. I like my pastas to be on the lighter side, so I tend to skip on them here.",

Pasta over cooked. Steak prepared raw, when i asked for medium. Cockroaches outside (i know, but still a big turn off when you know they're walking around by your feet and the sandaled feet of lived ones). This is the second time there in 2 months where the experience was subpar. Bloody Mary's are better on airplanes. Bartenders act like they are doing you a favor by serving you a lousy drink.",

Rain stopped and we finished our meal only to find that the manager had removed the appetizers from our bill as a courtesy. With that sort of service, I can only recommend Brio to everyone who lives and visits Vegas - way to go, management!  P.S. About the food:  Lamb gorgonzola - perfection! Mussels - delightful! Lasagna al forno - fresh pasta, meat, and sauce - enormous portion and very tasty! Salmon salad - had to take half of it to go.",

So the shuttle dropped us off here before the flight informing us we had about an hour and a half before pick up. We were seated and then given a ticket receipt to show our server and then in turn order from their prix fixe menu. Our server some young guy was obviously annoyed by our dinner package and kept making it clear that gratuity was not included the deal. For drinks I ordered a bellini and for dinner we had a caesar salad & a wedge salad , along with their lasagna & a pasta dish I can't remember. The white sauce with the lasagna was a bit strange since I'm used to red sauces but it was good, everything was good. The restaurant seemed like a fancier version of olive garden but I enjoyed Brio's much more. The server was the only thing that made this visit unpleasant, his presence was scarce and I knew dinner included a dessert which he claimed to forget but seemed like he just wanted us out. Would like to return and experience a better dining experience.",

MY girl & I had the Lobster bisque to start,\"Now I have had my fair share of bisque but this will go up there on 1 of my top 3 for sure\" I forgot what my girl had but whatever it was it was great. AS fo me...I had the Surf & Turf. REALLY GOOD but the portion was a little small. Never the less, our experience was great & I would highly recommend it to anyone. Why did'nt I rate it a 5 star...I'm a stickler for having our drinks filled at all times..even if it's just water,\"which I was drinking\". But in our servers defense, she was very busy & had a large section.  Maybe next time they will bump up to a 5 Star.",

I have gone in groups, with my hubby and alone and each time the experience and food quality was the same - very good. I have tried new things and never experienced a problem with any meal. I enjoy the bruschetta, lamb chops, ravioli, and angel hair pasta with multiple sauces.   We recently went with a group for my hubby's birthday when we arrived into Las Vegas from California and what a treat it was. We had a great brunch and hung out for a little while before we checked in to our hotels and headed for additional birthday adventures in Vegas!   I had the lamb chops and a tomato caprese salad-TASTY! The birthday man had the shrimp and grits and it was morningly good-he moaned through his culinary experience. Another party attendee had the caesar salad and commented on the freshness and the great dressing. The pasta Brio and the chicken sandwich rounded off the Brio experience! But wait, that dessert was to die for. The birthday chocolate a la mode cake was great, but that Peach Cobbler was to die for! We are still having dreams of it! Love it Brio!!! It was a HIT!!!!",

I love stuffed pasta, and this didn't disappoint stuffed with ricotta. The portions aren't as large as you'd expect from Olive Garden or some other pasta place, but larger portions doesn't always mean better food anyways. We saved half of our entrees to save as leftovers and munched on an extra serving of fresh bread. Yum!",

Our server seemed rushed and frazzled, not sure why.  When she came to take our order and got to one of our party who paused for a moment to review the menu she said \"let's go to the next person then.\"  Really?  We were never asked if we wanted second cocktails, dessert, anything else.  She brought our meal and about halfway through brought our checks without a word.  When we said we wanted another cocktail she scooped up our checks in frustration and eventually returned with cocktails.  All in all, pretty crappy service.  She made us feel like we were a complete inconvenience and she couldn't wait to get us out of there.  Plenty of other patios in Town Square to spend my money and be appreciated.",

Five minutes later...yes five minutes to remake the food umm...ok. The Manager brings out the food.

My mom and I Planned on coming to town square to hang out and do some shopping and we we're both hungry so I remembered Brio had a happy hour and it was almost 4 so perfect timing.   We came in and sat by the bar for happy hour and I was kind of worried it would be too hot since it was hot outside , but the bar area is shaded so it worked out fine. Even if you do sit by the patio by the walkway and street they have misters and umbrellas.   I decided to have a white peach Sangria which is $4 on the happy hour menu it was so refreshing and perfect for the hot weather and presented very pretty. My mom had a virgin Italian Lemonade because she was scared to drive with a drink in her :). For food we decides to go with Crispy Eggplant Fries ( recommended by a friend on yelp Thanks Nieves ! ) crispy ravioli and Tomato Mozzerella Salad just to start. The eggplant fries were perfectly crispy and super yummy. The pomodoro sauce for both the ravioli and fries was so yummy. The raviolis lacked flavor in my opinion. The tomato Mozzerella salad was really fresh and the balsamic glaze was perfect. It could have had more basil and glaze but that's ok. I just asked for some more glaze ;). I'm glad we only ordered those three dishes because a few raviolis in and some fries later I was stuffed.   All the servers were friendly and food and drinks came out fast. Despite how busy it was. I suggest coming early and seeing if there is a wait because it filled up fast for happy hour. I will definitely be coming back to try the regular menu as I'm lasagna lover and I'm out to find the best in vegas. That I'm yet to find maybe it's hiding here at Brio. I'll find out sooner or later.",

    "text": "I am a frequent guest at Brio, as the food tastes very good and I really enjoy the atmosphere of the restaurant. For me the best item on the menu is pasta alla vodka, which is handmade ricotta filled pasta with pancetta, garlic and basil in a spicy tomato Parmesan cream sauce. It is my favorite pasta all times and could eat it almost each time I visit the place and never get bored with it. I usually enjoy tasting various items from the menu in other restaurants, but pasta alla vodka is simply delicious and could never get enough of it. The only problem is that the dinner portion is exactly the same size that lunch portion, but more expensive... Slightly disappointing.  And obviously I did try other dishes from their menu as well and all of them have nice fragrant flavors. So overall good food with solid service!",

It was Friday night and the place was SLAMMED, 45 minute wait for a table. Wife and I decided to sit at the bar and try the house cocktails while we waited. Ended up staying at the bar where we enjoyed the company of the staff, full food service, and GREAT food! We shared the risotto and it was magnificent! Reminded me of the risotto I'd enjoyed in Northern Italy. Definitely recommend dining at Brio Tuscan Grille if you're on the Strip in Las Vegas!",

I picked up a card right at  the entrance to the restaurant for a free appetizer with purchase of an entree (score!).  We ordered the fabulous mussels (usu $11.50) that came in a bacon cream sauce.  The entrees were delish but my dining partner didn't like the lasagne due to the fact that it did come in a cream sauce but I thought it was great because it wasn't thick & lasagne noodle-y.  My veal milanese classico was tasty & is lemony with (in a good way).  Our waiter, Allen, was fine, not weird as was mentioned in previous reviews but forgot to fill our water & ice tea.  Pretty decor, plentiful food, had a lot of leftovers for the next day so all in all would definitely return but I'll also ask my Italian colleague what she thinks",

    "text": "This is one of my favorite places for casual sunday lunch dining. It is also a great place for dinner before or after a movie at Town Square. The main dining room has high ceilings with white fabric billowing across, while the private dining area is separated in a replica/ re-construct of the colloseum.   My boyfriend and I ALWAYS order the  \"quattro\" bruschetta, which  allows the sampling of several varieties, including roasted red pepper and mozzarella and sliced steak with gorgonzola, arugula, fennel, tomato and Italian dressing. There is always one item of the quattro that change.   A main salad that is a particular favorite of mine is the steak salad. The steak slices are prepared the same as the one used for the bruchetta. The dressing is incredible as well. I have also tried a chef special, which was a scallops with pasta. This may sound very generic, but the scallops were done so well that I now ask if they ever have it available. They do, however, have a great substitute, whichis the scallop and shrimp risotto. This platter is amazing. If you are drinking their chiantis or cabernet sav. it will help bring out the spice of the meal.   I am a huge fan of desserts, and for me, Brio does not disappoint. One of my favorites is the panna cotta, which is served in small espresso cups filled with the panna cotta, and a small amount of shortcake at the bottom, drizzled with strawberry syrup.  I have also tried the tiramisu, which is great as well. And yes, I have had two servings of dessert during one meal    The wine list is decently priced with a number of fine choices by the glass.  Again, one of my favorite places to go on a regular basis, but can be pricey to go that often.",

I had one of their dinner specials, the blackened scallops on pesto risotto, and thought it was great. The scallops were large and weren't gritty at all. The risotto was a pretty good consistency (not the best I've ever had, but still good) and had some bold flavors with the pesto and mushrooms. This dish is different than the shrimp and scallop risotto on their daily menu, by the way.   I love the fact that you can get small samplings of their desserts for 2.45 a shot. They're large enough to satisfy your sweet tooth without feeling like you're bingeing on a huge piece of cake or whatever. Most of the desserts are tasty, but not spectacular. The tiramisu and cheesecake are probably the best. I was impressed with the food and the interior of the place. It was a nice casual atmosphere and a relatively inexpensive meal.",

Upon being seated they took our order then we proceeded to draw on the paper table cloth protector for the table cloth under it.   Their salads are priced perfectly and are rather large, with quite the selection. 4.95. Bread & Butter (tasty). Sparkling water bottled for 2.95, and the entre which we split for 14.95, I wasn't ooo too hungry but the pasta had a very fresh taste to it. Then for the desserts, around 2 bucks for each one of the crme brles, we ordered the the orange flavor which was extremely sweet and tasty along with their lava cake.   Out waiter was very cool, when he brought the sparkling water to the table he had this fun look on his face, no lime. So I sent it back, he came back 5 minutes later with lime and the water, he ran to CPK to get limes for me, as they had run out 4 hours earlier in the night.   It's not a quiet romantic place, its very open and the sound is carried throughout the whole place. There is also indoor and outdoor seating.",

For this experience in particular, I decided to sit at the outside bar sonce the bar on the inside was already packed (also because the inside bar was a little too dimly lit for me). Upon sitting down, the bartender immediately greeted me and my friend and provided us with happy hour menus and asked if we had any questions regarding the menu. Her attitude was so nice, friendly and happy it instantly made me happy! I wish I had gotten her name.   I ordered the sangria rosa which was honestly so yummy. It was just right and not too strong. Definitely wins my heart over the white or red sangria.   For food I ordered the blackened shrimp with the eggplant. It was literally sooooo good and sooo filled with flavor and spice that I had to order it a second time. Definitely love coming to this Brio location especially for their HH!",

HH is available at the bar/seating around the bar indoors or outside. Bartenders and servers are incredibly attentive on a consistent basis and the HH bites and drinks are so worth the visits to Brio.  Below are my go to recommendations:  - Beef Carpaccio $4 Thinly sliced carpaccio topped with greens, capers, and mustard aioli. I will be honest... There has been a few times when the carpaccio has been chewier than preferred but I'm hoping those were a few one offs. The past two times I've visited, the carpaccio has been on point!   - BRIO Burger $6 Never disappoints. Comes already precut in quarters to share and the patty cooked to your liking. Also served with a side of homemade chips which are always delicious   - Black Pepper Shrimp and Eggplant $6 My favorite!! I don't think I've met someone yet who hasn't enjoyed this dish. Sauteed shrimp paired with small pieces of breaded eggplant - smothered in a creamy reddish black pepper sauce with just the right amount of spicy kick to it! I can easily devour an order of this myself   - Tomato Mozzarella Salad $5 Slices of tomato and mozzarella topped with basil and greens tossed in a light vinaigrette. Balsamic drizzled on top - a very light and refreshing salad  I personally indulge on their wine during Happy Hour - $5 for quality wine is quite the deal and the pours are great. Love their house Chardonnay.   I've been to Brio for lunch and dinner (they have a delicious bleu cheese steak salad and a variety of tasty pastas) but I'm definitely more a promoter of their Happy Hour!",

Then the main course was the NZ lamb chops, cooked to perfection coupled with the grilled asparagus and golden mashed potatoes. Both the food and service was excellent. Fabulous decor and ambiance.  Rounded off the meal with a hot frothy cappuccino, they make a great coffee. Wonderful experience, I'll be back!",

The joy of shopping in town square is that you can end your trip for a glass of wine or sangria and some spicy shrimp and eggplant and a carpaccio. Today we discovered that the menu had changed. And not only were there only a small handful of items left on the happy hour menu, but when our favorite foods arrived they had been decreased in size by over half. What normally was about 8 shrimp and eggplant pieces was now a meager 3 and at the same price. I had visited this location less than a month ago to the menu i had previously been accustomed to. So today was disappointing to say the least. When we closed our check and asked the bartender about the new menu we were confused when she said that no one has had complaints we both looked at each other confused. We couldn't fathom that  change so drastic hadn't been discussed. Needless to say, unfortunately Brio will not be someplace we frequent from this point on. Many great nights and delicious meals were had here. But cutting corners instead of increasing prices doesn't seem like a good business plan.",

My mother in-law also ordered side shrimps. She requested they put the side shrimps on a separate order.  My order was ok, the shrimps were not very well seasoned. My mother in laws lasagna was dry, had very little cheese and sauce. She asked for extra sauce and complained about the lasagna. They didn't offer to make her a new one. The shrimps she ordered on the side didn't come out until we were half way done with our food.  The lady told us the side shrimps were jumbo shrimps... I can tell you they sure were not jumbo shrimps! So, she asked for another 3 and the manager brought them to her. My mother in law decided to express her concerns to her and all she said was, \"I am sorry, I'll tell the chef about that.\"   We had to keep asking for refills... water refills!!! They were not busy what so ever for that. My mother in law asked for her dessert to go and asked to put that on her tab. They took forever to bring us the check after we asked for it. She came back to tell us she can't put the shrimps on a separate order! Why, who knows ?! That's not a problems, but we asked from the beginning to create a separate check.   They bring back her dessert and it was terrible. It's safe to say we will never come back and it this was an overall high priced disappointment. We should've just gone to Cheesecake Factory like we originally planned!",

(definitely not worth the 17$ btw) it was good but not THAT good to be worth 17$ for ONE crab cake lol but ok. My boyfriend had the shrimp lobster fettuccine, that was okay but lacked flavor. Overall food was average but not great and customer service was horrible. Our waiter was no where to be found when we needed refills and we didn't even have plates for our bread..... as soon as we entered to get seated as well , the girl was really rude. as much as I use to love brio , it's not the same.

Lunch here get's so crazy that I rarely go, but I was meeting some ladies for a little early for a business meeting so we decided to go here.  They had already gotten a table when I got there so there wasn't a wait.  However, there were only two place settings at the table and our server never even offered to bring me one or a menu or anything once I sat.  We ordered our lunches and still no place setting.  When our food came I had to ask for silverware, which he brought, but no napkin, which I had to ask for so he finally brought it.  I had ordered the steak medium rare and it was medium.  I ate it anyway and didn't complain since I wasn't paying for lunch and I knew these ladies were in a hurry.  If I had to rate Brio on all my visits together, I'd give it 4 stars, but based on this last visit alone I have to be honest and say it was only a 3-star visit.",

Spinach and Artichoke Dip: - Has a hearty, cheesy flavor - Great for veggie-haters too, you can barely taste then - Perfect chip-to-dip ratio - enough for six adults  Gerber All-Natural Lemon Pepper Chicken: - beautiful presentation - not sure how to describe the vegetables, but the way they prepared it is a mix between fresh off the grill and also steamed (??). My point, veggies were delish! - the skin in the chicken was crisp and crunchy  - the meat on the chicken was moist, I didn't even need a knife - not a huge mashed-potato fan but it's mixed with 'mystery' seasoning that revolutionized my thoughts on mashed-potatos  Our server was genuine and knowledgeable. I just can't give that fifth star because of the hostess though.. It was dinner time when we came in (6 adults and 2 kids) and she told us it was about an hour wait. Understandable. We were all tired and weren't about to walk to another restaurant though. Noticing a few empty booths, we asked to be seated there but she promptly told us it's only for parties of 6. They looked pretty spacious and the two kids are no more than 4. We said we didn't mind cramping together and she told us, 'She would need to ask because they don't set the tables for 8.' She seemed extremely annoyed at our request as if placing two more plates was such a huge hassle -.-  Good customer service is a big deal to me. Brio's got their food DOWN PAT, they just need to work on service and they'll be awesome!",

We took advantage of our rewards card and started with the Garlic, Artichoke, Spinach Dip which was delicious (especially those little cheesy triangles of deliciousness they serve it with). For entrees he went with the Lobster and Shrimp Fettuccine which he couldn't stop raving about and I decided on the Fettuccine with Tomato Compote and Kalamata Olives (which I wasn't too sure about when I ordered, but was SO glad I did, because it was delicious and under 600 calories!) Our 3 year old had the kid's pepperoni pizza which was delicious and more than enough for him (and such a steal at that price point!) We finished off with a free birthday dessert (thank you Brio for taking that extra step for us!), and the kiddo enjoyed his kid's ice cream sundae.  Our server was wonderful, he was friendly, attentive (but not hovering), and made our dinner extra special. We truly appreciate the wonderful customer service and delicious food to boot.

I mean $3.95 appetizers and $5 martinis, sangria, and wine? How could you beat that? You'd really have to decide which would come first, a food coma or a drunken state.  My personal faves here are the Beef Carpacio, Ravioli Caprese, and the Eggplant. For the drink specials-it's all about the Peach Sangria, and the Mojito. Best believe they don't hold back on the alcohol either!  Also, their angus burger which is also on the happy hour menu is definitely a double BANG for your buck. I took my aunts here for happy hour and just got a kick out of it1 They loved the decor, and the ambiance, and most of all they loved that they were full off of yummy appetizers.   Our server was also very helpful and friendly. She even went out of her way to separately send out our dishes so we weren't overwhelmed with food. Not like thats a bad thing or anything!  I will crave you again soon Brio.",

The bread brought out before our entrees was really delicious and warm. I don't know why, but I thought I would mention that... I ordered the brunch special which was Eggs Oscar - two poached eggs with a shrimp  crab cake over potatoes and veggies. It was very tasty and the eggs were cooked perfectly. My sister got the pesto pasta which she said she really liked. I tasted it, a little bland for me, but she really seemed to enjoy it.  We didn't try it but I have been told by a few people that the white peach sangria is really good.  We got the little desserts in shot glasses - tiramisu for me (good) and key lime for her (amazing!!!) I would love to come here with a group and sit inside because the atmosphere is so cute and the menu seems like it would have something for everyone.",

    "text": "This is now my favorite restaurant.  As an overview, the food is excellent, the service is professional and fast, the noise level is a bit loud when crowded (like Cheesecake Factory), the lighting is low, the prices are on the higher side, and you get seated almost immediately with reservations. We came for dinner on two occasions around 6pm both on Saturday.  The food is one of the highlights.  I recommend the 8oz filet, or the crab and shrimp cakes, or the lamb chops, and the sampler bruschetta, the Tiramisu, traditional cheesecake, and the Torta Di Cioccolata (like a fancy lava cake with Gelato).  I recommend those  since those were the only dishes my wife and I have tried so far and they were very good!    The beef and lamb were cooked perfectly to order and seasoned just right.  The roasted veggies that came with our entrees were very good although mine were slightly over seasoned.   The crab and shrimp cakes were awesome...  not too much breading,  not overcooked, and the quality of the seafood was great.  When I took my first bite it reminded me of San Francisco (that where I grew up).  The crispy potatoes that came with this dish was really good and so were the roasted veggies.  The bruschetta was pretty pricey but was pretty good... if you want to skip the appetizers, that's ok because the rest of the food and experience is more than enough to satisfy and leave you with a smile.  The desserts are a wonderful sweet topping to the experience here.  The cheesecake, has no graham crust but I guess that's traditional.  It was still really good.  The Tiramisu was just the way I like it.  Anyways...all of the desserts that I've listed above go well with the coffee served here.  FYI when the waiter presents you with the dessert tray, they are presented in little cups, however they do have the regular size versions of those.  The portions were the right size.  Let me put it this way,  when we left, we did not feel like we overate.  My wife and I have come here twice in the past two weeks and we love it.  The first time was on a date night and we were very happy.  The second time we came was for my dad's 70th bday.  My parent were happy and my wife and I were happy... Good times!  Hope you enjoy it!",

On a mission for cheap eats and drinks at town square, some friends and I decided to go to Brio Tuscan Grille since we always go to the usual spots like yardhouse. We actually arrived just in time for HAPPY HOUR (Mon-Fri 3pm-6pm) Niiiiceeeee!!!   The staff at Brio are super friendly, so helpful. Our server was such fun too. She suggested on what top picks for appetizers and drinks to try - kudos. We ordered the... **Beef Carpaccio -  (field greens, capers, mustard aioli, and shaved Parmigiano-Reggiano cheese). **The Brio Burger - (bistecca burger with mozzarella and housemade chips). **Spicy Shrimp & Eggplant - seared shrimp in a black pepper cream sauce over Romano crusted eggplant).  Yum yum yum! hunger was satisified, not overly full.  Brio is definitely a MUST in Town Square. They have a nice outdoor seating area with misters for the vegas heat ahhh! and at night, you can sit by the fire pit to set the mood with a loved one (idk if anyone wants to do that now?! extra heat, no thanks) lol.",

    "text": "I've been coming to Brio Tuscan Grille since they've opened up at Town Square eons ago. I know, I like to write my reviews late. Even when I relocated for three years, whenever I visit Vegas, I would always have dinner at least once at Brio. I would always suggest Brio as an option to my out of town friends. And more than once did we celebrate birthdays with dinner at Brio.   Honestly, I've never really had a horrible experience at Brio. If we had any issues with our meals, once we bring it up with our server, they'd always manage to get it fixed right away. One of my most recent visits to Brio, our waitress was a blast -- we had a lot of fun kidding around with her.   However, I am a little sadden by the fact that a few menu items have changed, such as the steaks. They no longer offer the surf and turf or just a filet mignon with veggies dishes. Though the steak dishes they have right now are still pretty good. I gotta say, the price you pay is a whole lot better than what you pay for if you eat at the strip. Brio has awesome prices (even though the prices have gotten bumped up within the past three years).   It can get loud while dining in though. There are tons of people talking, laughing, etc. But it never really bothered me.   As for what to get to eat at the Brio? I'd say try anything you want. Everything I've tried was very good. Some of my favorites are the steaks, rack of lambs, and the carbonara. I also enjoy their bruchetta a lot. One of my favorite drinks at the Brio has got to be their peach bellini -- it's always so yummy!!! Don't be afraid to try anything there :)",

Amazing appetizers, flatbreads and drink specials. My absolute favorite is the spicy shrimp and eggplant. It is so much creamy spicy goodness! Oh lord have mercy!!! It is ridiculously yummy! Funny thing is... I am not crazy about shrimp and I'm not crazy about eggplant. Somehow this just works! Have also had carpaccio, pasta and the Gorgonzola crusted lamb. Everything has rocked!!! Also, awesome outdoor patio with plenty of misters and shade so one can sit and people watch outside. Fantastic drink specials as well!",

I would say better than Yardhouse happy hour, but then again I'm not a big fan of Yardhouse. Their food menu is great. Multiple options for only $3.95 each!!! And drink specials are only $5!! And they aren't little skimpy appetizers either. Order about 2 or 3 items along with drinks, you'll definitely get full (well at least I did.)   We ordered the spinach artichoke dip, shrimp piccante, margherita flatbread, brio burger and 4 cocktails. All came out to $35!!! Not bad for an afternoon of food and drink. Their peach sangria was definitely tastey and I was already on my second one even before the food came. All the items we ordered were delish. Good portions with a lot of flavor on each. Easy to share and reasonable on the price. The bar was busy so the bartenders weren't really on the chatty side. In conclusion, I would say this was a successful happy hour!!!",

Been in Vegas countless times but usually for work, so know the restaurants and bars in the hotels. Rarely do we ever leave the strip but the teenagers were asking for Italian so I got on Yelp and found Brio Tuscan Grille. We drove over and found a cute strip of restaurants. We were seated immediately even though they were busy. The decor is cool, the service excellent and the food was on point! Salad was fresh, pastas were made to order. Everything was top notch. Definitely a staple on our future visits to sin city.",

Luckily we had reservations and so we were taken to our table. We each ordered an entree, since I'm part of the restaurant's loyalty rewards program I get discounts and promotions in my inbox regularly, I was informed by the staff that I couldn't use my promotion due to some weird random company policy.   The prices have increased significantly in the last 6 months, AND the food quality has definitely gone downhill. The chicken dish I got was rather stiff and over cooked. Service seemed very absent, and not very friendly.   Really really disappointing, and I will very likely cancel my account and never set foot here again.",

Today I just stopped in for a glass of wine and to use the Wi-Fi so I could get some work done while waiting to check into my hotel. I found a comfortable seat in the bar area and couldn't believe how great the service from both the bartender and the support staff were.

It is just too out of the way, especially if you don't have a car or you would rather go wild. This is not the place for you. The patrons who come here are mostly an older crowd or families, so this is not a party spot.  The food here isn't too bad. It isn't gourmet, but it isn't trash. We ended up ordering the Pasta Pesto (Angel hair, grilled chicken, caramelized onions, spinach, tomatoes, red peppers, Feta, basil, light pesto sauce) and the Fettuccine Rustica (Fresh egg pasta, spicy marinara, capers, basil, Kalamata olives, Parmesan). They were both just ok, nothing special. A little on the bland side.  Overall, I would probably try this place again if I was in the area.",

Finally, after 2 years later, decided to go on a dinner date with my mom after a long night of mother daughter bonding (a.k.a retail therapy).  The minute we walk in we were greeted with pleasant smiles and warm \"Hellos.\" I was expecting to wait to be seated because the shopping center was busy that night, however, I was mistaken. We were seated right away.  The atmosphere is awesome, definitely a place I'd consider having a wedding reception at. The decor is beautiful, the lights are nice and dim, the ceilings are vaulted and it makes me feel like I'm eating in a chapel. It's very fitting to have either a romantic dinner or even a casual lunch.  The food was delicious. The portion was perfect. It didn't leave me still hungry nor did it make me over-stuffed. Started off with bread and lavash and a lobster bisque. The lobster bisque was just a little bit salty but nothing that a piece of bread couldn't compensate for. Shared a Chicken&Quinoa Salad and Pasta Pesto and it was absolutely delicious. And for dessert I enjoyed my favorite, Creme Brulee, made perfectly.  I will definitely be returning.",

The experience was just like the Brio I remember and used to frequent so often. Jessie the manager made sure to make everything right and went above and beyond to ensure we had a great experience. Our waiter was so friendly and funny which really made the experience that much better. Kudos to Brio for doing it right and for reassuring me that this is definitely my forever go to destination for weekly girls cocktail nights and business lunches. All of their food is amazing and I'm glad this was such a pleasurable experience. They have excellent misters so don't be shy about sitting on the patio to enjoy a nice dinner or app.",

We ordered so much. We started with the Bruschetta sampler. There wasn't a bad one in the dish!! I think for each of us, this stood out as the winner. We ordered peach sangria, mimosa and coffee. The coffee was average, drinks were above average in quality and alcohol ratio.  I ordered a Greek chopped salad. It was inexpensive and hit the mark. My friend ordered a burger and fries. She said everything was great, my other friend ordered breakfast- eggs, toast, potatoes. She said the potatoes were pretty super. Then we finished it off with mars Capone cheesecake. This was everything I had expected it would be when they showed & explained it to us.  Everything about this place works for me. Really a perfect place for brunch! Again..... do the Bruschetta!!!!",

I've ordered it several times and I received chicken marsala, roasted veggies and mashed potatoes (the entree), bread/crackers, and the salad. Last time I ordered, through Amazon, I was missing the bread/crackers. I decided to give them another try--mistake. This time, I got chicken and salad--no bread, no sides. I called and the manager told me that it has always come like that. She said: If I wanted the roasted veggies, mashed potatoes and bread/crackers, I needed to order for 8 to 10 from the catering menu. First, it's not True (because I've ordered before), but it also makes no sense. If you are ordering for a larger crowd, an entree includes sides but smaller families don't deserve sides? Hmmm, strange approach, which makes zero sense. I was ripped off and will never order or visit Brio again. Certainly don't order the family meal if you want to actually feed your family--even if you've ordered it before.",

The menus are quite similar also Portions are quite generous as my wife and I shared everything. The dip was pretty good and the bread that came with it were pretty big. The bisque was ok as it had more of a butter flavor than lobster flavor. The lobster bisque at Top of the World in the Stratosphere tasted way better. The pasta was pretty good as it pretty much tasted like a pot roast with long, thick egg noodles. Our waitress/chefs were nice enough to give us 2 divided plates of the dish.

While our waitress was very nice, she was forever missing in action and when she would take our table of 8 drink orders, she'd return with only 5-6 drinks, the others would sit thirsty. We'd flag her down and politely ask if our drinks were coming and she's look through her notepad and look confused, then 10 minutes later deliver our remaining drinks to our parched friends. Salads and appetizers ordered, again, a salad is missing and as two of the three appetizers are brought to the table, the third elusive appetizer never arrives. Meal orders placed, all miraculously arrive. I ordered the Pasta Fra Diavolo, which, by its name alone signifies it is a spicy dish. Ugh, no. Quite flavorless honestly. Bland as the napkin on my lap. My husband ordered the Under the Brick (or something like that) Chicken, he said it was not very good, again, lacking in flavor and depth, he was disappointed. Other items ordered was steak which was said to taste very gamey and sat on the plate next to the watery mashed potatoes. Lobster and Shrimp raviolis were said to be okay, but not fantastic. The friend who ordered the Blackened Tilapia said it was very good, however the plate next to her was the Chicken Milanese was not good at all, overly salted and dry.  Our check took forever to be delivered. Once we paid it was $113 per couple, including a cocktail each. I usually am not super high maintenance, but I felt like I had to beg for a refill of water or the check. The food was not toothsome as one would hope. Big let down.",

The food was great! I absolutely loved the lobster bisque, great texture with chunks of lobster in it. It went really well with the cracker-like bread that came in the bread basket, which was also fantastic. And I never like bread. The Mediterranean shrimp was good, and I was pleasantly surprised because I usually don't pair seafood with cheese. It was a nice light dinner and I was able to finish it without feeling too stuffed. Everyone else at the table ordered pasta and took home leftovers. My neighbor ordered pasta with sausage and it smelled great!  I would go back for sure.",

    "text": "After wanting to try Brio for so long and hearing about their good food, we finally came here for dinner the other night. It looked a little busy for a Tuesday night, but thankfully, we only had to wait a few minutes before being seated. The first thing I noticed was that the place was very loud. Also, the tables were pretty close to each other. We sat next to a party of 4, who was obnoxiously loud, swearing, and complaining about their jobs all night. It was like we were being forced to listen to their conversations. Not the restaurant's fault, but just an FYI, you may want to request a booth or a table outside instead.  Service was a bit slow at first. One guy showed up to give us our basket of bread and butter (loved the sourdough bread), but our server kept us waiting for about 20 minutes. She actually turned out to be very nice and attentive, so I guess I can forgive the wait. :p At first glance at the menu, I was a little worried that I wouldn't be able to find anything to order. I love Italian food and pasta, but all the dishes seemed complicated for someone who is very picky as myself. My order was about to sound like this, \"Can I have the Chicken Pomodoro Classico with no tomatoes, pine nuts and basil?\" Then, I spotted the only pasta dish with ingredients that I actually liked! Surprising, I know. I had to look twice just to make sure.   The Campanelle Carbonara had grilled chicken, bacon, Parmesan cheese, spinach and Alfredo. Sold! Our dinners came out about 10 minutes after ordering. My pasta was very flavorful and not salty. The chicken and bacon were cut into perfectly bite sized pieces. The Alfredo sauce was just right and not overpowering. My husband ordered the Roasted Lamb Chops and said they were very good. I never liked lamb. I tried it at Texas de Brazil and didn't like the taste it left in my mouth. However, these lamb chops did look good with the red wine sauce it was served with. For dessert, we shared the Tiramisu, which was delicious as well. A perfect balance of coffee and creme flavors. They also have a gluten free and light menu.  It looks like they have a MyBRIO loyalty program that you can join for free. According to their website, you get a complimentary appetizer valued up to $10 as a welcome reward. Our server didn't mention that to us at all, so I guess I'll have to remember to ask about it the next time I am there. Brio is a bit on the expensive side, but I would definitely want to come back every so often. The food was awesome! You won't be disappointed.",

My complain goes out to the Manager if I'm not mistaken her name was Ashley... from the moment we were seated til we left I observed her going to the surrounding tables greeting them asking how their food was and so forth ,new tables next to us were seated a couple of times and not once did she walk over to acknowledge us. Sounds petty but it left a bad impression being that it was our first time there. The waitress walked over to check on us and I said nicely \" What's the managers name the woman who's been walking over to these tables next to us acknowledging every other table besides ours? Is it because everyone else that's here is Caucasian and we're not? \" She said oh I'm sorry I'm sure that's not what it is, I know being minority it feels like a racial thing sometimes but I'm sure that's not what it is.\" I made it very clear that I never ever feel that way because I have a multi cultural family. She asked if I wanted her to address the issue and have her walk over and I refused it. I did not want her walking over to us just because I complained.  As a manager your supposed to set an example for your staff and I think she did a poor job at that tonight. So thank you but no thank you we will not be coming back to your establish",

My husband and I had our wedding rehearsal dinner here also, so it's near and dear to my heart.  You start off with a basket of free bread, and Parmesan crusted sesame crackers that are delicious. I ask for oil and vinegar as opposed to the butter that comes out with it regularly.  The menu has a wonderful variety of salads, pasta, fish, chicken and steaks. My favorite menus items include: the strawberry chicken salad, steak salad, and chopped salad , the ricotta stuffed pasta in the spicy vodka sauce, the lobster bisque,  salmon Fresca, and also the beef medallions. I'm picky about my steak being cooked all the way through, and they always do a great job.  This place is also super kid friendly. Crayons to color on the paper tablecloth, and the most delicious kids size Mac and cheese that is easily shareable for two children.   Brio, don't you go anywhere.",

My server I should make that with the place is this empty, there would be no problem getting the food in a hurry. She did not lie. . I ordered the barbecue chicken pizza from the appetizer menu . In other restaurants when I order pizza there is at least a 15 to 20 minute wait before this pizza is ready. The pizza was on my table within 10 minutes. And it was delicious. The crust was sweet and soft ( a little chewy, just the way I like it). The pizza itself was not overwhelmed with the barbecue chicken sauce flavor. There was an abundance fresh greens that decorated the top of the pizza. A lunch for one for under $10 before the tip. Such a good deal!",

We ordered the chicken lemone with no capers and chicken Milanese. We also had the wedge salad which was split for us. The salad was delicious. The entres came out and the lemone chicken had capers on it and we did not want to wait for a remake so we said we would eat it. I looked at my Milanese and found a 4 oz piece of breaded chicken on top of a half cup of pasta that was dry at the edges with a small amount of sauce.  I questioned the size of the chicken and pasta and was told this was the serving. If I wanted the dinner portion I could pay up but it is mostly a pasta increase not more chicken. The Lemone chicken came with 2 pieces of chicken and my friend said the breading on the chicken tasted mostly of egg. Ever since they changed the lunch menu it has been disappointing. Not worth the price. Very noisy .",

They have an absolutely gorgeous patio with canvas curtains, string lights, and comfy chairs. They have this raspberry mojito that is so delicious that I get one every time I go there. It's romantic and intimate. The staff are excellent, I have never had anything less than perfect service when i've gone there. It's a more mature crowd and probably one of my favorite places to go on a date. I would try the food again, because it is possible I just had a few bad experiences.

After submitting my complaint to Brio's management, they took exceptionally thorough remedial measures to correct the issues I had.  They talked to the waiter and offered a discount on my next meal.  I understand that screwups happen, but when a restaurant takes the effort to mitigate the poor experience, that's worth a lot to me.  It means the restaurant does care about your dining experience.  The management staff was very attentive to my concerns and I would go back to give them a second chance. :)  (Prior Review)  For 75 dollars for a group of three, this place is was a major disappointment.  The decor is nice with vaulted ceilings.  The ambiance is loud but acceptable.  The problems with this place are significant.  I can recommend the carbonara since it was the only dish that was properly seasoned.  My two associates ordered the lobster risotto and veal scallopini.  Both dishes were sent back for being underseasoned.  The risotto was overcooked and thereby mushy with only a hint of lobster taste.  The scallopini was so underseasoned that my associate had to cover it in vegetables to give it some flavor.  The service was equally disappointing.  Our bill was mixed up with another table.  If I didn't check the receipt, I would have overpaid.  I informed the waiter who corrected the mistake.  However, when I asked for the receipt showing the prior charge was voided, he argued that the receipt was fixed.  I think he was too busy trying to argue with me that he wasn't listening to what I was asking for.  He then blamed me for not being clear.  Holy crap.  Are you serious?!  I left a 4 dollar tip only because leaving ZERO is reserved for particularly egregious service but this case came close.",

And the wine they brought over was a perfect pairing.  My friend who was with me did not like her breaded chicken dish at all and tried to swallow it down.  I let the waiter know since she was unwilling to speak up but she didn't know what else she wanted.  He said, \"Do you trust me\" and she affirmed.  \"He said, I've got just the thing for you and you won't be disappointed.\" And she wasn't.  The mini desserts in little Turkish coffee size cups (e.g. Tiramisu, Creme Brulee) etc were perfect for those who don't have any more room for the Big Boy Size confections but could slide in a bite or three amidst the now expanding pasta in one's stomach.  We finished the meal outside taking in the great Vegas weather and the delightful ambience that is Town Square.  I've been there before, I'll go there again.  I'm a fan.",

It felt back home for a while.We sat in the gazibo room, the  lites were nice and dimm, and the atmosphere was great. Sandy was our waitress and she was very polite and spirited. Her recomendations were awsome, the ceaser salads that came out were fresh and the lettuce crisp the lobster bisqe was good too.The basket with the bread that came out was nice and hot. As soon as they  saw our table empty with bread they kept on coming with more, and they always refilled our drinks as well. The pasta dishes with ricotta panceta in a vodka cream sause excellent (Pasta a la Vodka),the brazed beef with cremini mushrooms and homade noodles was great, the flavors were all there, awsome!! The mohitos are a little on the lite side, but it was corected from Sandy.The deserts that came out in little espreso cups [2.50 each] Smart!! Very good idea you can try them all. In general the experience was great and we will be back. For a chain restaurant to look that good and please their customers so well, gets 5 stars from me. PPERRRFFECCTOOOOOOOOOO!",

I didn't know I could do that and was glad he suggested it. A full bowl of Risotto would have been too much for me. My friend had Crispy Eggplant Pomodoro, which she enjoyed. The eggplant was cut in thick slices and wasn't overly battered. We also had a bottle of Chianti Classico, San Fabiano (Tuscany, Italy). The total bill was just over $60. I would definitely go again.",

Our group was put in a lovely private room with 2 servers to assist us. The food was really, really delicious! My favorite being the grilled pork chops, yum. We had the room for 2 1/2 hours and I was able to have a cake delivered and also put out favors at each table. The servers always asked us  prior to adding any charges to our bill. Very well priced. Beautiful setting at Towne Square, inside as well. Not high end but well presented and a great value and looked and tasted MUCH more than the price reflected. What a memorable evening!",

    "text": "Brio is unexpectedly great for several reasons.  They have good food, especially taking into account the fact that they are a chain.  The restaurant itself is absolutely beautiful- comfortable booths and drapery hanging from very high ceilings, beautiful colors and lighting (bordering on ornate, but in a good way).  Outside is equally beautiful, including tables and chairs that surround firepits.  They have nightly happy hour (3-6pm, 9pm-close) and really good bruschetta apps with different toppings (shrimp, mushrooms, etc).  Their penne fra diavola with shrimp is delicious (spicy tomato sauce), and they have nice shrimp and crab cakes.  There are nice salads, pastas, chicken, seafood and steak dishes on the menu (Tuscan Italian style).  Their desserts are all available in mini sizes, which is pretty awesome and rare.  Good wine list.   They also have a nice weekend brunch here.   Reservations are a good idea on weekends or you will be waiting well over an hour to sit down.  It is not the best Italian food of my life, but the food is always delicious and the atmosphere is great.  I especially love this place on summer nights, sitting outside.",

I honestly have say I really missed the burger and chips they used to have on the menu.  Happy hour is at the bar or bar tables only. We had to use the outside bar tables since there was no available seating indoors. I recommend going somewhat early if you want to be seated indoors. Happy hour is now until 6:30pm which is nice.  Service was great and I love having bread for the table especially while waiting or enjoying drinks.  I absolutely recommend Brio for a good happy hour in town square.",

Brio makes that happen and does so in an excellent way.  The menu has creative versions of Italian favorites and plenty of more traditional items, and they are very flexible with special requests. They also have a good sized kid's menu as well.   The service is extremely courteous and the servers work together to take care of the greeting, beverages, ordering and food delivery.  This particular Brio does all of the above especially well! I've been to this one twice and have no doubt I'll be back there again soon.",

Although it's a chain restaurant, they do many things right (see above).  The dinner started off right with the Tomato Caprese salad, high compliments for the freshness of the tomatoes and the basil.  The entree was the mushroom ravioli substituted with the marinara sauce.  Really like how the ravioli was put together and had generous filling of mushrooms.

It's beautiful inside, absolutely marvelous, it seemed a little too dark on our side where we were sitting though. Waiter was very kind but sort of went awol for a while. We were seated quickly which was nice. Now our problem was really in the food. I ordered the Gorgonzola crusted beef medallions. The gorgonzola in my opinion really gave it a weird taste. I'm a lover of cheese and you can catch me at cheese tastings all day, but this just wasn't a good combo, it was really overcooked and for the price I was expecting a little more steak at the very least. Veggies were a bit cold, mashed potatoes were good though. Didn't even order dessert after which was quite sad. Overall could have really improved",

Aparently a company called Food First recently bought Brio and made all these changes.  Prices have gone thru the roof. I mean, I threw a fit when they raised the price of a cup (not bowl) of soup to $6, then to $7, and now it's $8. Who the hell pays $8 for a cup of soup?    Now onto the ever shrinking menu. Yet another chop job of the menu last month and all my favorite dishes have been removed. They are down to 2 or 3 dishes in each main category. Chicken limone, chicken piccada, and many others all gone. The remaining entrees have had price increases. Two main entrees and two soda pops will cost you $80-$90. Good luck with that.  The $8 bowl of soup I ordered came out cold. Then before our main course (after we ordered it) arrived our waiter came by and asked \"would you like anything else or just the check\" I was like is this guy smoking crack!? They are down to a skeleton wait staff and service is slow.  Been coming here for 10 years but as of last visit I will not be back.",

It is offered Mon to Fri from 3:30-6:30 pm and the food ranges from $4-$6, which is why we always come in for. Every time we dine here, we've never have a bad experience. The staff are always super friendly and attentive with checking on us from time to time. Since my boyfriend and I had friends in town, we decided to take them here last Wednesday night. Although I have to admit that it's been awhile since we've been to Brio, we were a bit disappointed that they limited the happy hour to the bar only instead of outside in the patio where it used to be. Of course, it didn't stop us from still wanting to dine here regardless of where they offer happy hour. Some of my favorite items off their happy hour menu are the tomato caprese, calamari, chicken pesto flatbread, and the margherita flatbread. As for the alcoholic drinks, I always love getting their white sangria. It's so refreshing especially on a hot and sunny day in LV.   Overall, Brio is a good spot for a date night or if you're looking for a place to hang out with friends. I definitely recommend checking it out.",

    "text": "Brio is Italian inspired from the decor and structure of the restaurant, to the food and drinks they serve.  Brio is very glamorous and grand when you walk in. There's part of a colosseum and gorgeous European-style chandeliers to add to comfortable, spacious seating and dim lighting. If outside seating is your choice, the seats are light and modern with spray that cools you from above without drowning you and umbrellas to shade, which is perfect under the Vegas sun.  The happy hour many is varied and both food and drinks are delicious! It was a shame that the lovely cocktail I had wasn't available to be made (even without HH pricing) later in the evening, but there is still a variety on normal menus too.  We had the shrimp and lobster pasta and the sausage and pepperoni flatbread (starter) to eat and both were substantial enough in size. The pasta was slightly bland but full of seafood which we enjoyed and the flatbread (although more of a pizza) was great!  Servers and hostesses were very hospitable and friendly and we were made to feel extremely welcome from start to finish.  Much enjoyed!",

Every course. The complimentary bread is lovely, served warm with butter. Ordered egg white veggie omelette and berry brioche French toast from the brunch menu. Added a side of breakfast potatoes which were probably the best brunch potatoes I've ever had. Crispy fingerlings sliced length-wise and seasoned to perfection.  Service: Our server was delightful. He came by regularly, offered options without being pushy, and refilled our water/coffee at just the right time. I don't drink coffee, but my table-mate raves that his drip coffee was probably the best he's ever had. And he drinks a lot of coffee. Stuck with water for the drinks, but they did have quite a selection of flavored bevs and mimosas which I'll try next time.   Vibe: I love Brio, their lunch and dinner has also been delicious and a great experience. The interior of Brio is fancy enough, wide-open with lovely draperies and Italian design. Highly recommend!",

I know it's nothing close to being there, but a girl can dream ;)  I always get the bruschetta sampler which includes nine pieces of bruschetta. Three of their original, three roasted red pepper, and three of their sliced steak bruschetta... my personal favorite. My favorite pasta dish I have gotten is their Campanelle Carbonara. Their creamy alfredo sauce mixed with the chicken, spinach and bacon is the reason I continue going back. Campanelle pasta is a unique kind of pasta and adds to the dish.   This past time I came here for dinner they have Risotto on the menu for a limited time and of course I had to try! I got the Sweet Potato and Chicken Risotto and it does not disappoint! I recommend trying out this restaurant soon so you can have a taste at their Risotto!",

This last weekend I dined and tried the lobster bisque which was amazing and the pasta alla vodka is my favorite dish. Bruschetta sampler is great as well. All dishes are decent sizes, not too large but not small either.   There is indoor seating and patio seating, the patio is beautiful in Vegas. They offer an amazing brunch and happy hour menu on top of their normal menu. The waiters are okay, not very talkative and only come to the table a couple times, hence my 4 stars not 5. The service was fairly quick, however.   Def a great option if you are out and about shopping!",

We decided to have cocktails since they looked appealing on their promotional menu. We ordered the Berry Cooler and the Berry Cosmo and my gosh, were they disgusting! They tasted like chilled cough syrup. I asked my husband to let me try his and it was actually worse! So definitely a thumbs down on those! We ordered the Pasta Alla Vodka with shrimp and the Salmon Strawberry Balsamic salad. These dishes were amazing, totally made up for the crappy drinks we ordered (which were still at our table not to be touched)  Overall it was a good experience, we'd definitely go back. We just won't be ordering any mixed drinks",

The inside of the restaurant was nicely decorated and very clean. The service was also very friendly and attentive.   The food was great. We ordered a bruschetta sampler appetizer which had a few different types of bruschetta on it. I wasn't the biggest fan of them, but that was a personal taste thing, my two friends loved it (sometimes traditional things just can't be out done). I had a glass of sangria which was decent, but tasted syrupy too me. These reasons are why I took off a star.   My entree was delicious. The sauce was very light which is my preference (heavy creamy sauces make me feel like a blimp after my meal, some people are into that, but not me). I'd come back and order it again definitely.   Also, they have a promotion right now if you sign up for their points club thing you get a discount on your meal that night (I think it was 20%), which was a nice surprise. Pretty much 100x better than olive garden, and for about the same price.",

    "text": "One of the best happy hours in Las Vegas! And if you don't agree, please message me and let me know which place has a better happy hour! This review is for their happy hour only since we didn't look at their regular menu. Happy hour is from 3:30-6:30 and I believe they have a late night happy hour as well but I could be wrong... so call and double check.   If you park in the structure near Staples, you can walk through Inglots to Brio. I wasn't expecting such a fancy place but it was! Bar is self seating and they had some couches and benches on one side, and a covered patio on the outside along with a wrap around bar. Service was a bit slow in terms of getting drinks out but our server, Danielle was sweet and checked on us often.   Brio's sangrias are on the sweet side, but they are definitely tasty! I ordered the white peach sangrias while my gfs ordered the sangria rosa. The white peach sangria was a bit sweeter than the sangria rosa. Brio also offers $5 martini wednesdays and $5 wine thursdays! The martinis that they offer include the classics but also some interesting specialty ones as well. I'll have to come back on a Wednesday to check it out!  We ordered 3 beef carpaccio (yes, it was THAT good). I wasn't too fond of the parmesan flatbread... which was more of like a chip to me. The field greens salad was lightly tossed with a dressing which worked very well with the beef carpaccio.   2/5 Sausage and pepperoni flatbread: the flatbread was a bit TOO crispy IMO. I think they might have slightly overbaked it. There wasn't enough ricotta on there, but the pieces that did have ricotta were delicious.   3/5: Brio burger: the brio burger is one burger, cut into 4 pieces with their homemade chips on top. I didn't care much for the chips and neither did my friends. I thought it was too salty. We ordered the burger to be cooked medium, but it came out to be medium well, which wasn't a big deal. The meat was juicy and the bun reminded me of a hawaiian roll.   4/5: Black peppered shrimp: My friends LOVED the sauce that came with this dish. I thought it was a bit spicy (just a kick) but enjoyed the eggplant. There were about 9 pieces of shrimp in the dish. The shrimp was small, but nicely presented and for the price, it wasn't too bad. My friends ended up dipping the burger into the left over sauce.   We were all stuffed at the end of our meal and the bill for everything, including 2 white peach sangrias and 5 sangria rosas was about $70. Not bad at all! Brio is our new happy hour spot and we can't wait to come back.",

    "text": "Slightly above average, judging by the multiplicity of Italian establishments in Las Vegas. Very decent wait time simply because the place is huge and they sit indoor or outdoor, looks like there is a constant flow of diners coming and going. A lot of tables were large parties, a lot others had children, so they are friendlier than other strip restaurants where arriving with a child is worse than showing up in your surfing gear. Calamari arrived promptly, fresh, crispy and spicy as described. Too bad the Caesar salad was bland and watery, no hint of anchovy and garlicky flavor for a dressing so easy to prepare ahead. Grilled salmon was soft in the inside, crunchy out, and the best dish was the Caccio e Peppe spaghetti, al dente just like in Firenze. Service is excellent, several refills of iced tea during an evening when our duty prevented us from drinking so we did not sample the wines which seemed reasonably priced. Next time we'll try other dishes and a glass of Pinot Grigio or Super Tuscan and if consistent with tonight experience, will declare them a well deserved 5 star.",

Who knows if they were used before us because there were crumbs all over the plates. Our server came by, Kai, who seemed very nice. It was a very busy section that we were placed in, so we understood how busy he was! We had to ask for a bread refill at least 3 times before the manager came by to ask how everything was, she finally got us our bread and a refill on our drinks. Kai only checked on us when we ordered our food, and when we needed the bill. Not too impressed with that part of our experience. Our food was delicious though!",

I recently went here for lunch/brunch on a Sunday with some friends to catch up. The server was patient with us when one of our friends arrived late (meaning he didn't rush us to order and honestly he never seemed annoyed we weren't ready to order, which is annoying, but I appreciate his patience). We ordered a carafe- which we got 6 glasses from (not bad). Overall well received!",

We were seated with an energetic server who had personality and she made a point to tell us this is known as the best Brio! She said everyone claims the food here is better than anywhere they have gone. I ordered my normal Chopped Salad with Romaine lettuce (usually includes iceberg), Grilled Salmon included an over salad.  My husband loved his dish Chicken Marsala!  I sat there and spent a lot of time pulling out leaves of romaine that should have been discarded to begin with, not in this salad.  We didn't bring it to the server's attention until after we received these check we spoke to the manager.  I realize we should have called someone over while I was peeling the lettuce out of the salad-the server saw it in the plate she never cane over to see how it was she certain asked my husband and he replied, \"Delicious!\"  I found it very weird that all the server did was to apologize and she would bring it to manager's attention. Not a very good practice for a manager of a corporate owned store!",

Everything is solid, great portion, and tasty just a bit over priced in my opinion but well worth the visit during happy hour. I love their bruschetta so I got the bruschetta sampler which was really tasty and a great variation of flavors. Their bread assortment is quality as well as their soups and salads. I ordered the chicken pesto pasta had tons of flavor however they went a little light on the pesto for my liking so if you really like pesto make sure you ask for extra! My friend got the crab cake entree which looked amazing I tried a piece and I will probably order it next time I visit. All in all a solid Italian restaurant that I would recommend if you are in the town square area!",

First off It Took an oddly very long time to get service, while the restaurant was not busy. The server with the bread showed up 15 minutes after we sat, dropped the bread as a walk by without aknowledging us, 15mn later we finally got the apologetic server asking us what we wanted to drink and EXACTLY 12 minutes later we got the next server asking us about our meal order. After 43 mn we finally got our orders in... The Caesars salad were a bust, lettuce had way too much water in it, which made everything else blaaaa, and I am not even talking about the 3 croutons fighting for survival in the plate, the 3 shrimp in it were tasty if you are on a diet. The turkey club sandwich was sad, and the chips overly cooked, the lasagna were decent but not like they used to be and the lobster bisque sadly were extremely salty, portion was a half cup and tasted like a Campbell soup on its worst day...it truly made me cry in the inside as it was one of the best items for me to enjoy after they removed the seafood risotto. I had to send it back, no one at the table were rejoicing about their meals so we cut it before dessert. The waitress was kind enough to scratch the lobster bisque. Overhaul no, I would not go back...",

The only explanation we were given was that they were running behind because it was Valentine's Day! Well obviously that's why I made a reservation. Maybe you shouldn't double book your reservations so you can seat people that expect to be seated on their specified time.  Disappointed!!!",

Other than that, you get great delicious food for under $4 dollars during Happy Hour!!! The beef Carpacio, the fried ravioli, the flat bread pizzas and the spicy shrimp with fried eggplant are highly recommended. Beautiful atmosphere and inviting \"al fresco\" patio dinning with fire pits. I have been here too many times to count (parties, happy hour, lunch and dinner service) but have always had great food and service!! Speaking of service, I once slipped and fell as I entered the bar area. I was more embarrassed than hurt. In fact, I was fine. But the wait staff and a couple patrons rushed to my aide. Their concern for my well being was very touching!! The Manger gave me her card and insisted I call her if I needed to seek medical treatment due to my fall at Brio. Happy to report I was fine and I did  not need to seek medical attention. It took longer to recover from the humiliation of the fall than the pain from the fall itself...lol!!",

An old friend reached out to me the other day and suggested we do dinner, so we decided to visit this place last night.    The place is dramatic.  There's linen draping the entire top of the inside.  The lighting is dim and super intimate.  Great place for a date!  Our server was cordial and didn't bother us much during our meal.  I appreciate very personable service and a lot of interaction, so it was a little quiet for my taste, but not bad to say the least.    Tonight, we got a bottle of the Tavolo Matto (house brand) pinot grigio.  It was good enough for a house wine at $24 for the bottle.  I also go the sweet potato & chicken risotto for $17.65 which is a weird price.  One thing I can always count on Brio to deliver is an awesome risotto!  So creamy and perfect!  I LOVED the big chunks of sweet potato, asparagus and chicken.  Brio tends to change what they add into their risottos however, I don't mind.  Whatever they add, I know is always good.  I don't tend to visit this place often because I consider it on the higher end of my budget.  I don't really think spending $30 a meal (including drinks) is spending my money effectively, however, it's a great place to visit once in a while.  Tonight was a special occasion and I'm convinced that Brio will be a great place to return to on another occasion!",

You can easily make a whole meal out of the Happy Hour menu for less than $10.  The downside... HH ends at 6:30pm.",

    "text": "So we eat at Brio at least once a week.  Food is great, servers know us, and it is generally a great experience.  However, every time we go we order the Pasta Yandolino.  It is no longer on the menu but they ALWAYS make it.  EXCEPT our last visit when the \"chef just didn't feel like making it...\"  Not out of ingredients, not we just can no longer offer it since it is not on the menu, etc.  The waiter, who is very cool, said the chef was just being moody and said he didn't want to offer it anymore or \"didn't feel like making it today\"  WRONG ANSWER buddy...I'm sure it means nothing cause the place does have great food and is always busy but you just don't do that to your regular customers.  Food is a 5, Chef is a 0!!!",

    "text": "Date/time: Feb 10 @ 9p  My friend wanted to try this place out for her birthday dinner. Online suggested a reservation. I had made a reservation for 845 but had trouble finding it and arrived at 9p. I apologized to the hostesses who were [very welcoming]. I informed them it was my friends birthday and left her name with them. They sat me by the kitchen. I'm very impressed with the atmosphere and maintenance.  My waiter came over to greet me, I ordered a water with lemon. He forgot the lemons and said he would return with them. He returned, no lemons, asked if I would like an appetizer. I ordered an appetizer chopped salad. 30mins goes by and my friend arrived. He comes to greet her and take her drink order, I reminded him about my salad which he got promptly. The salad was excellent. Good portioned and lots of flavor for only 175 calories!  We order the light selection mahimahi and lemon chicken. The mahimahi was very good, fresh, not over cooked and well portioned. The lemon chicken was juicy but not over powering with a generous portion of veggies. Our compliments to the kitchen. I pushed my empty water glass to the end of the table and watched my waiter walk right by. I said excuse me. He came back. I asked for a refill and the manager. The manager knew I STILL had not received my lemons, my salad took 30mins, and I was just overall not pleased with my service. She was very apologetic, got my friend a mini birthday desert, discounted our check, and took over our table herself.  Even though it was a rocky first experience I would still come back and suggest this restaurant. I'm very impressed with the management and kitchen.",

I plugged my iPhone in and was going to let it charge.  Nobody noticed and it wasn't even visible, but I felt that I should just mention it to the receptionist.    She said that I could NOT charge my phone there.  I asked why, and she said that she didn't know whether my phone had any viruses.  I asked how my phone could infect their system thru a charger adaptor?!  She had no answer but said no.  Wtf?!?  I've never had a bar or restaurant refuse to charge my phone.  The food was good as it usually is.  Started with calamari and steak carpaccio.  Entrees of veal milanese, pasta brio, pizza, mac & cheese... All tasty.    Service was good from our server but they don't have bussers or other servers touching tables.  It took forever to get plates cleared off our table.   We had our empty app plates stacked on top of each other until the end of our meal.  Plus it took forever to get refill on drinks and order more cocktails.",

I eat there at least once month.  On Saturday I had brunch with a friend. My server Erika was friendly and informative of the entrees. She was concerned that I was ordering to much food since their portions are large, so she convinced me to split a Cesar salad with my friend instead of ordering one for myself.    Erika was right, it was too much food, I was stuffed after eating my Calamari appetizer,  Cesar Salad, and one omelet with roasted potatoes.  Yes!!! It was to much food.  Thanks Erika for having my back!  I also witnessed Erika's interaction with other patrons, and she was polite, professional and friendly with each encounter.   A few things I would recommend, is to offer refills on beverage service without me having to ask. Trying to flag someone down for a refill for my Arnold Palmer was annoying. In addition, when serving an appetizer for two, please bring serving utensils, it was difficult to serve ourselves without any cutlery or spoons for the sauce.  Brio should have a loyalty program for their regulars offering lower priced cocktails and food.   Cheers & Bon Appetite!!",

The atmosphere is comfortable, nice bar area, outdoor patio seating makes this a very nice place for dinner.  One friend had the Lobster Ravioli and we both thought they were excellent, She didn't leave one bit.  Darn it!   (We always taste each others dinner.)  The other friend had the Mediterranean Penne, she loved it.  I thought it was pretty good.  I had the Chicken Limone which I love as Chicken Piccata when I make it at home.  This one was awesome.  Two large, very tender chicken breasts in a creamy butter/lemon sauce.   Sides of crispy potatoes and roasted veggis made this a truly wonderful choice.  The Caesar salad we ordered, (mine with very good anchovies) were a little on the dry side but very good flavor.  The romaine lettuce very fresh.  My Cosmopolitan  was perfect as was the others' Fruitini.  A fruit flavored martini.    Service was good, except our waitrees forgot to bring me extra lemon for my chicken.   Not a big deal.  The place was full - unusual for a Tuesday evening and she was very busy.   Valet parking is available if you can't find a spot on the street.  This is one we will definitely return to soon.",

Not even the sauce could save it, Marsala usually has a nice, nutty flavor. It had no flavor at all, very disappointing. After seeing the decor and tasting the bread and the Bisque I was expecting a great meal, it was far from it. A microwave meal has more flavor.....",

It was nice, I felt like I was in a fancy, posh restaurant!  Our Seat:  They must have had about 15-20 extra waiters and staff sort of loitering around the restaurant.  It was super awkward.  Here's what is more awkward: having those waiters hovering over your table, waiting for their orders from the cafeteria (or was it a kitchen?), talking about clubs, their nights, conquests and misc. other adventures.  Appetizers:  Very good.  Let's say B+.  Stuffed peppers.  Best part of the meal.  Entrees:  This was where it just got bad.  Two terrible entrees.  Mezza Chicken Limone tasted like I was eating straight egg.  Zero flavor unless you ate a moutful of salt and capers.  Do yourself a favor, if you want a chain Italian restaurant in Las Vegas, head on over to the Macaroni Grill and save yourself some time and money.  (Yes, it was bad enough for me to recommend Macaroni Grill)",

This is the place to celebrate family birthdays, bring people when visiting from out of town. I have had very good experience with staff until tonight. My son's 14 bday dinner. The waiter was the most clueless waiter I have seen comparing to restaurants in the level of Brio. From the beginning, he forgot to bring my soup, i didnt bring it up thinking it was an honest mistake. Then, i was without a drink for 21 minutes and when I asked him, he never brought it. My daughter had to go to the bar area to ask and another gentleman who brought my drink while our waiter was high fiving and hugging every girl including the hostesses that would cross his path. When our dinner came out, we usually get a \"Did your dinner come out ok?\" from a regular waiter. This guy said \" Are you all happy now?\" After the drink incident which im sure someone told him about it, he didnt even recognized and owned up to his mistake but ignored it completely. To top it off, he comes towards the end to ask if we wanted dessert(Of course we said no) and made a comment if our party of 4 switched places on the table....I just had to make a comment to see if he gets it and I said; \"Maybe you should come around more often\"...that comment flew in front of his forehead and he didnt even have a reaction to it.....I have never seen this guy before but next time I go and if i decide to go back to this location, I will make sure I dont get this waiter and run away from his area. Tivoli Village location is almost the same distance for me. I guess i will make that decision later. I consider myself a good tipper(20% to 25%) for average service. At the same time, I give less and even $0 if the experience is a disaster like tonight. I am not looking or any freebies or anything like that but i someone needs more info on who this individual is, please feel free to message me or comment here.",

My husband and I very rarely get out of the house, and on our long awaited date day had planned to go to brio for the happy hour that we've heard so much about. I was looking forward to it greatly, but upon arriving the bar was completely packed, not a single chair available. We asked if we could have happy hour at one of the nearby tables and were told we had to be sitting at the bar or on one of the couches (which were also all taken). The bar area was surrounded with 10-15 unoccupied tables that would have done the job, but instead of allowing us to sit and enjoy happy hour with everyone else, our business was turned away. Extremely disappointed in how this situation was handled. Management wasn't even apologetic. Will not be returning... Waste of my time and excitement.

There are so many flavours and it touches every single centimetre of your Tuscan palate. Calamari is fantastic and we got out reservation within the half hour we called it in. Perfect service, and she was fantastic and talked to us a lot. The only problem was that no birthday wishes were sent to my mother--who had her 50th that night. I called it in through the phone and they said they would wish her a happy birthday, but nothing happened.  Maybe I'll pull the waiter aside next time!!",

I love to sit outside when it's nice out. Some of my favorites are their bread, the White Peach Sangria, Spicy Shrimp with Eggplant, and the Chocolate Lava Cake (it's called something else on the menu). I especially love the \"Lighter Side of Tuscany\" aka healthy menu- every item I've tried has been delicious. Come here, you won't be disappointed.",

    "text": "This place never seems to disappoint in the area of food.  The management and leadership can still use a little work.  The open at 11:00am and first the girl  had a hard time unlocking the door and keeping it unlocked.  Once she got past that everyone was let in and from the first person on, you were told it was a 5 minute wait to be seated, REALLY???  There was no one seated yet, what was the 5 minute wait for?    We requested to be seated outside but when our name was called the person taking us to our table took us to a table inside.  We told her we asked for an outside table and were taken back to the front and told to wait while her and the host figured it out.  In the meantime, other people were seated both inside and out.  Finally we were taken to our table outside.  There was no one else sitting on that side yet so there was a wait for the server to be notified that people were starting to be seated in his area.    From this point on, everything was awesome.  I had the 5oz filet with sweet potatoes and asparagus was cooked more towards medium rare then medium which is not unusual for this kitchen but none the less it was good.  We also had a salad which was amazing.  At the end we ordered cappuccinos and some desert.  When mine came, I noticed it had cinnamon sprinkled on top.   I called the waiter over and asked if it was cinnamon and he said yes with a surprised look that I was even asking.  I looked at him and asked, Don't you remember I told you I was allergic to cinnamon and we had an entire conversation about this and the sweet potatoes?  He thought for a second and said, oh yes we did talk about that and this was his mistake and he was sorry and would get me another one.    So even though the food is really good, from the hostess not listening to where people would like to be seated (inside or out), to the kitchen not really preparing food properly as ordered to the server not really paying attention to his customer and the customer needs is the reason for the 3 stars and the statement at the beginning of this about the management needing a little more work and leadership experience.",

I am not a huge fan but agreed to meet since it was her birthday. My other friend and I arrived first and scored a nice table outside as the weather was perfect. Our two friends arrived shortly after us and we all got comfortable. I just wanted to have a light lunch so I chose the Strawberry Chicken salad. My friend chose the Chicken Limone. My salad was better than expected with good flavor from the spicy pecans and the goat cheese. We also enjoyed really good service. Our server was always there filling up our water and tea. She was kind enough to take a couple of pictures for us too which I know can be a pain when one has several other tables to take care of. I have been to both Brio's here in town and I would have to say that I like the one at Town Square over the one at Tivoli Village. The atmosphere and the outdoor patio dining at Town Square is much nicer then having to inhale exhaust from the cars that are driving through Tivoli Village. I do like Brio's happy hour too during the summer as they offer some great drink specials at decent prices. This was an afternoon of good times with good friends to celebrate Buon Compleanno!",

I'm from out of town so planning my sisters baby shower from Arizona was a bit nerve wracking. Nova could not have been more helpful! He gave incredibly helpful and detailed advice, was patient with my many questions throughout the process and ensured that every single request we had was accommodated. He went above and beyond throughout the entire experience which gave us such peace of mind. We were grateful to be working with him on this and would highly recommend both him and Brio to many friends and family!! I also want to mention Matt, who we spoke with one day throughout the process, who was also extremely helpful with his advice on the menu and updating a few things for us. They make a fantastic team! Responsive, professional and incredibly accommodating and happy to help. On the day-of the event, Mauricio was a lifesaver!!! He helped us hang so many signs and banners that we could not have done it without him. He was also so patient and happy to help. This made the morning set-up so much easier and brought our vision to life! We could not have been more grateful to have his help throughout the entire morning. Both Mauricio and Nova deserve kudos for executing the event perfectly both in advance of the event, and on the day of. We truly appreciate this as it made a very special day for us memorable and all the guests had a wonderful time.",

Finally we got seated and began to look at the menu, dinner time. My daughter was set on the shrimp and lobster fettuccini. Took me awhile to have my mind set as the menu choice was great. Many things to pick from. I ended up getting the beef short ribs. Quite a wait must I say. Very upset too our server was just rude (wish I got the name). I kept looking around and saw there was bread at the tables with people eating and we did not get any so I figured it wasn't complimentary. We got our food after a wait and my daughter politely asked our server if the bread was complimentary and why we didn't get any and she straight up goes, \"it is but you should've asked earlier, your meals already here.\" I had to bite my tongue as I know my daughter didn't want to cause a scene. My short ribs were dry right off the spot. And I expected a thicker meat. I look over to my daughters and it looks great! But where was the shrimp and lobster?! It was just sauce, pasta, and tomatoes etc. she loves seafood too so she was pretty bummed out. We both just ate it as we were about to spend money on this meal we could've made at home.   I wanted to get her dessert because she's been with her mother a couple days so I just wanted to make the dinner better but the \"warm chocolate cake\" wasn't even warm. We were over it already. Slow seating, rude sever, and disappointing food. Would I go back to try it again? Possibly. But this whole experience was just sad.",

We went on a Sunday night and they seemed to be pretty busy but their service was very fast. We got our drinks and appetizer right away. Our food came not too long after that. Which was great! Usually places being that busy take quite awhile.   We ordered calamari as an appetizer and blue moon and moscato for our drinks. My bf wasn't please with the blue moon coming from the bottle. But I was very pleased with the moscato and the calamari was good. For our entrees, I ordered lobster and shrimp fettuccine and my bf had the 8oz filet mignon. Although, my bf was disappointed that the steak was almost smaller than my fist.. both entrees were delicious!  Would come here again whenever I crave Italian!",

    "text": "Good Happy Hour OK service!  I like coming for the happy hour but the service could really use some help! I've been coming here for about 4 years since its in a great central location.  It's easy to get people to meet here since its central to Summerlin and Henderson.    There is outdoor dining as well as inside dining.  You can only get Happy Hour in the Bar/Lounge area and it is first come first serve for seating. It can get busy especially when the weather is nice so try to get here early especially if you have a decent size group. The outdoor area has fire pits set up as well which is perfect at night when it can get a little chilly.  Happy Hour is $4-$6 small plates and certain drinks.  The sangria is pretty good along with the martini (order it dirty and add Blue Cheese olives for a little extra!).  The beef carpaccio is delicious but not very filling so order a few if you have a decent size.  Some of my other favorites are the eggplant fries, and the black pepper shrimp with eggplant.  The problem with happy hour is either the bar staff isn't properly equipped or they are just too aloof to actually give good service. Every time we have to wave down our server for silverware, napkins, to put in additional orders, or to let him/her we are ready to pay.  On one specific occasion we tried to get the bartenders attention for 20 minutes to place more drink orders and he ignored us.  Finally as happy hour was ending he said sorry happy hour is over. Thats not good customer service in my opinion as I know he saw us trying to get his attention since we were sitting directly in front of him.  I have also come for brunch and the service was still a miss. We split the Tuscan omelette and the berries and cream French toast. Everything tasted pretty good.  Over all tasty Italian inspired cuisine for a good price with aloof service from staff members who would do well with a little customer service training.",

Their chopped salad was fresh, and crisp with chopped olives, tomatoes, cheese and mouth watering vinaigrette.

Our waiter was super friendly and knowledgable about the menu. He made some good suggestions.   I had the bruschetta quatro along with the salmon Fresca. I wasn't feeling in the mood for salmon so I swapped it out for chicken.   Overall this place is good. Love the environment, the food is great, and we liked the service.",

Turns out we were basically the last ones waiting for a table. 2.  We never did get a basket of bread, not sure what the other reviews are talking about. 3.  Only two soup selections ... Lobster Bisque and Cream of Mushroom.  As I'm lactose intolerant ... no soup for me! 4.  Ordered the chicken limone (picata) ... it was pretty good. 5.  Price for two entrees, one soup, one tea, one mineral water .. almost $80 with tip.  A little on the pricey side. 6.  Other reviews mentioned going here for date, disagree!  Way to noisy and not all all intimate.  MUCH better places to take a date.",

    "text": "First time at Brio today! Decided to sit outside because the weather was amazeballs. The wait wasn't too bad (20-ish minutes) and we got to sit outside in the nice weather. However, there were numerous hostesses that all seemed not very friendly. They were just okay. Our waiter was chill and friendly enough. Key word -- \"enough\". Meh.  My lunch date ordered something on the brunch menu and waited quite a while before the waiter came and told us that brunch ended at 2 (it was 3pm). However, the menu stated that brunch ends at 3:30pm, which was bewildering to say the least. Last time something like this happened to me where my original dish couldn't be made and I waited a while, the restaurant gave me my meal for free. Brio offered nothing as compensation and the apology sounded far from sincere.  So why 4 stars if the service was not very good? The fooooood! The sourdough bread was warm and yummy and the cracker positively bursted with flavor. My risotto was tasty and cheesy without being too heavy (the chicken in it was a little dry though). The salad I chose with my risotto was the wedge salad, which was huge and crispy and well-plated and just awesome.   My date ended up ordering the salmon with angel hair pasta and he was a little disappointed when the plate arrived at the table. \"Only this much food for 15 bucks?!\" Well he took a bite of the salmon and was surprised to find it juicy and tender. The taste definitely made it worth the price.  The food far exceeded my expectations but the service left me hungry for more. I will probably eat here again if I'm at Town Square and the weather is nice. Hopefully the employees will be friendlier and enjoy their jobs more next time I visit.",

The lack of check ins is a reflection of my phone dying or me leaving it in the car -_- i prefers the Tivoli Village location because its prettier and less crowded - oh! and less kids :D   There is always plenty of parking in the garage either so you can avoid the hot hot sun or the cold of winter. When you walk into the restaurant, the hostess is always there with a smile and walking you to your table immediately.   I really like the waiters here, because you can tell they're a team and they're always looking out for each other. Whenever it does get kind of busy, and our waiter is running around, another waiter from another section will come help us or tend to our needs. They always saying they're helping each other out, which is nice to see. At the other location in Town Square, other waiters are always ignoring us unless we're their table.   The lobster bisque is really good and not too fishy tasting. I personally like penne pasta with vodka sauce. They don't have it on the menu though - they have another type of noodle with cheese in it with the vodka sauce. I always ask for the penne vodka though, and they are always more than willing to accomodate and ask the chef for me. I always add shrimp too! Makes me feel like someone important because theyre doing something off the menu for me haha   My boyfriend has gotten a combination of some type of steak, lambchops, and several pastas, and they are always good!!  We always OD on bread so if youre hungry, you should ask for no bread...because once its on your table, its hard to ignore it!",

She was personable and very professional.   Ambiance:    TWO STARS -  We were seated in the dome area; it looked tired, dingy and absolutely lacking in energy and excitement. The chairs were uncomfortable.  Food:  ONE STAR -  Several meals were served; my personal experience pretty much covers it all.  The strip steak I had was nothing to write home about; it lacked that \"grilled\" flavor you would expect of a steak being served in a fine dining establishment. Portion-wise- it was a decent size. The accompanying mashed potatoes were hot and cold, suggesting they were microwaved. Their texture was like the flour and water you used to make a paper mache project in elementary school. As for flavor, well let's just say they did not even come close to being a \"fine dining\" entree; even KFC delivers a better mashed potato. The veggies were worse! My veggies were so overcooked, they reminded me of the shriveled aliens you see in sci-fi movies. Visually, they were simply gross looking.  Thankfully, their flavor was better, but not by much.  Definitely not a \"fine food\" entree!  OVERALL DINING EXPERIENCE:  Double thumbs dow.",

My man and I usually share the burger as well.. The sucky part about this place would be that you can never tell if you're going to be able to get a spot or not.. The best place to sit is inside in one of the booths or outside by the firepit if you have a big group but it can get pretty busy.  Another negative thing is that sometimes there are lots of pigeons out on the patio... Boo! But hey what can you do..!?",

Lastly, the waiter knocked over an entire glass of water inside my purse ice and all... He handed me a napkin, apologize and that was it. I was there cleaning out my purse, trying to get the ice out. He never mentioned it again, checked if I was okay, nor tried to help me clean my LV $1236 purse. I was pretty disappointed. The only good thing was the food, and the decor.

I am not exaggerating! You heard it - world class! I simply did not expect this at all - it was that great!  From the moment we walked around the beautiful exterior of the restaurant and sat in the waiting area and got to see the gorgeous interior of the restaurant I had a great feeling the experience would be great - but it actually excelled that expectation!  We were seated quickly even though we were told we would wait a bit longer. I could not help but look at the pretty earth toned surroundings while my BF and I chatted away. I had read that the risotto was great here so I looked for it on the menu but could not find it. Well, the waiter overheard that I was looking for the risotto and he said that he would see if they could make it for me anyway. WOW!!!! Double WOW actually, because he came back soon and said that they would make it for me!   The bread basket here is just great! They kept it coming too! They serve a thin crisp bread which is just divine!  Their iced tea is great and it kept coming too! We never had to ask for anything. The waiter was always looking to make our meal just perfect! You should have seen us drink it too! The hot desert night made us so thirsty!  My shrimp risotto with red pepper was a dream of a dish! The rice was just right and the creamy sauce was ever so tasty! The shrimp were fresh and cooked to perfection! I am not a big fan of any kind of pepper but they integrated the pepper into the dish ever so subtly and created just the right level of spiciness! It is like they read my mind! OMG!!!!  My BF had grilled shrimp, steak and chicken. It was soooo tender and juicy that I just wanted to cry tears of the utmost food ecstasy! It all had a really nice grilled taste to it too!  This place was recommended to us by a good friend of my BF and he really impressed me with his taste on this one! Thanks Pedro!  Parking is no issue since Brio Tuscan Grille is located in a large mall. There is outdoor seating as well. Great for people watching! Let no one fool you - this is no average Italian restaurant!",

We spoke to the manager about him and he was very pleased to hear what we had to say.",

Pricing was as indicated - $$, a great value and well worth every penny. I definitely would come back and highly recommend.",

For the primi, we had the spinach artichoke dip and it was amazing! I am a huge fan of spinach and artichoke dip and this is definitely one of my favorite.  The complimentary bread they give is also so good! They give you soft, warm bread, and cripsy flatbread with balsamic vinegar and wine...oh so good. I would just go for this! Their caesar salad and Brio chopped salad was good, nothing really special, but they both did taste very good. I had the Chipotle Chicken & Bacon Panini with charred tomato, carmelized onions, spicy chipotle mayonnaise, Fontina, Boursin and Applewood bacon. The Bacon was superb! The sandwich overall was perfect! I would get this next time I go to lunch. For dinner, I had the Grilled Salmon. I am also a fan of salmon, and the salmon was cooked to perfection for me. It came with Romano crusted tomatoes, citrus pesto, asparagus and crispy shoestring potatoes.  For dessert, I had their tiramisu. It was okay, nothing worth mentioning about it.  The service was great both times I went and I loved the decor around the entire restaurant most of all. It really made me feel like I was in another world, not just in another LV restaurant.  If you go to Las Vegas, this is a must try for some good Italian food and not as expensive as on the strip. Plus, you can shop and walk around the Town Square afterwards :)",

Since it was a SpyonVegas event there was not much seating. People were herding over the drinks and there wasn't even enough organization. Eventually we were able to get a spot on the couches. The server was helpful despite the chaotic mess of people. We ended up ordering everything on the appetizer menu. My recommendations- the spicy shrimp & eggplant platter, steak bruschetta, and Margarita pizza. For drinks, definitely have the regular or peach Sangria.",

The restaurant itself is beautiful and has indoor and outdoor seating as well as an indoor and outdoor bar.  Since Brio doesn't take reservations, you'll often have to wait a good 30-45 minutes which is plenty of time to get yourself is peach bellini (yes, it's girly and frothy) which is wonderfully refreshing and not too sweet.  The waiters are all very attentive, even when the place is slammed, which is a nice change from the LV norm.    Food wise: the bread you're served upon seating is piping hot and delicious; the lobster bisque is amazing; the brio chopped salad is great (but I recommend getting the balsamic dressing over the red wine); caprese bruschetta is delicious, as is the roasted red pepper brushetta (blanking on the name); and those mini desserts (creme brulee especially) are the perfect endings to a great meal.",

We were sat at a table for 6 people.  The wait staff did not remove the extra settings and we finally asked them to take them away.  We were given lunch menus and had to ask for dinner menus.  The bread came and it was cold and hard and the breadstick like items were soggy.  My friend tried to order a pale style beer, didn't have one, ordered a lager, didn't have one so he got a Sam Adams.  I ordered a whiskey sour, i couldn't taste the whiskey, drank it ordered another one and it was totally different than the first one, neither of them had a cherry.  They told us when we first sat down that there were only 4 lobster bisque soups left, my friend said he would take one, a minute later they brought us two and we still didn't even have the dinner menus, they took them away and gave them to another table which I thought was against health code.  We asked for more bread and got the same as before.  I ordered the shrimp venuto (or similar) and it when I came it was obvious it sat under the hear lamp for some time.  I thought it was terrible and actually spit out a few bites and didn't finish it.  Our friends pasta dishes also looked like they sat under a heat lamp for a while and no one finished their meals or even asked for a to go box, that's how bad the food was.  Our waters were not filled unless asked.  All in all a very bad dining experience, so bad I felt compelled to yelp.  Hopefully we just experience an off night. But with so many other dining venue to solicit, we will not be going back to the Brio.",

Veggies were fresh and the portion was good size. The Campanelle Carbonara was presented in a soupy white sauce that was very thin and tasteless. The thin Alfredo sauce was the consistency of a white wine sauce. When asked the server explained that was normal. The pasta was cooked properly but was not fresh. Clearly prepackaged dried pasta. The special for the night was a Chicken and Vegetable Spaghettini this too was served lukewarm. Surprising to have that happen considering the place was half full. No big tables or crowds.

We walked in with no reservation, and when we were seated prior to our estimated wait time we were pleased. That came to an end by the time we were seated. We waited around 10 minutes to be introduced to our waitress and get our orders in. There was an average of 20 minute increments between getting our drinks (besides water) food, any refills and the check. This was a Thursday evening towards the end of the night, no reason at all for service to take that long. As far as the food goes, it was okay. The spinach dip appetizer was hot and full of flavor, definitely a large enough portion to share with 3-4 people. I had the Campanelle Carbonara which had an overwhelming flavor of bacon. It literally took over the entire dish. My boyfriend had the Chicken Limone which was a nice well-rounded entree between the meat and veggies. Dessert was a Torta Di Cioccolata and was the best part of the entire meal- melted chocolate inside the cake complements very nicely with the scoop of vanilla gelato. Maybe we'll come back for Happy Hour next time, I've heard good things. Hopefully we score with better service than this evening.",

The Husband really enjoyed this and was about to get another!  * Beef Carpaccio \"Served with field greens, capers, mustard aioli and shaved Parmigiano-Reggiano cheese.\" - Our favorite of the ones we tried, so we got two orders.  So good and tasty, and the field greens are a nice complement to the dish.  * Margherita Flatbread \"Fresh Mozzarella, vine-ripened tomatoes and fresh basil.\" - Very basic flatbread pizza, no fancy frills here.  A nice simple crunch.  * Sliced Steak Bruschetta \"With Gorgonzola Dolce, arugula, fennel, charred tomato, shaved Parmesan and Tuscan Italian dressing.\" - Four slices of bruschetta makes this a hearty dish with the cheese and beef.  Good flavors though and sauce adds a nice sweetness.  Unfortunately, their happy hour only extends to the food so there are no drink specials.  (When I called, whomever answered said there were drink specials but it wasn't so when we sat down.)    The bartenders took our food and drink orders, and the food came out promptly.  We had no issues with service as a result unlike the other reviewers.  Overall, it's a nice place and we enjoyed ourselves here.  The dining room looks like a grand hall with all the drapery.  I suggest getting your grub on here and getting drunk somewhere else if you want to save a few bucks.  Update! 07/15/09 - Went back again last Friday and finished off the entire Tuscan Tasters menu.  * Brio Burger \"A quartet of BRIO's famous Bistecca Burgers, with smoked Mozzarella and housemade chips.\" - A very decent size burger for three bucks that was tasty and cut into four, perfect for sharing.  Chips were yummy too!  * Spicy Shrimp & Eggplant \"Grilled shrimp with Romano crusted eggplant and a black pepper cream sauce.\" - A surprise goodie!  Came with eight shrimp/eggplant stacks and definitely would definitely order again.  * Sausage & Pepperoni Flatbread \"Fresh Mozzarella and housemade tomato sauce.\" - Good pizza where they aren't shy about the toppings.  * Shrimptini \"Chilled shrimp served in a martini glass with roasted tomato cocktail sauce and fresh lemon.\"  Uneventful of the bunch, fine for simple shrimp but lacks any excitement.  * Roasted Red Pepper & Fresh Mozzarella Bruschetta \"With fresh basil and balsamic drizzle.\" - Tasty bread bites with four pieces of bruschetta.  This time we went with a group of four and ordered one of everything.  It pretty much filled us for the most part, although if you're hungry, just double up on the burgers and meatballs.  We grabbed a little table this time in the bar area inside and our waitress was fine again.  It took a bit of time to get the table cleared and for the orders to go in, but nothing to complain about.    Overall, they did well again for filling our tummies on a budget!",

Three of us in our party had the Chicken Marsala and one had Pasta Brio.  The Chicken Marsala was tender, large size portion, Marsala sauce was flavorful and good consistency, plus they don't scrimp on the mushrooms. The asparagus was seasoned to perfection and cooked perfectly, as well. We all had Caesar salads that were fresh and with a great tasting Caesar dressing ! The Pasta Brio was also a huge hit... rigatoni with grilled chicken, and seared mushrooms , in a roasted red pepper vodka sauce! Just a winner of a night all the way around! Fantastic dinner, outstanding service, beautiful ambiance,  and lovely company to enjoy it all with!  Anytime you want to awaken your taste buds with a flavor-bursting meal, Brio is definitely the place to go! :)",

    "text": "This is as good as it gets for Happy Hour. I am only rating Happy Hour. Brio, Monday to Thursday, 9pm to close at the bar, $2.95 per Tuscan Taster, which are supposed to be appetizers but are the size of entrees. $5 Martini Thursdays can apply to the Tuscan Taster Happy Hour special, and if it's not Thursday, but you have a card to show that you're in the food and beverage industry, you can get $5 martinis even if it's not Thursday.   They used to have the Steak Bruschetta, but they took that off the menu and replaced it with the Mozzarella Red Pepper Bruschetta with Arugula. Anyway, to the food.  Brio Burger: ordered this at medium, came with crisp chips and a nice plain brioche bun. The meat was delicious and fresh. The chips were really crispy. Dip this in the tomato sauce of the  Ravioli Caprese: 3 pieces of ravioli, circular, with cheese topped with basil and tomatoes.   Beef Carpaccio: paper-thin slices of raw beef (about 6) with a little aioli, capers, some leafy greens, and a pizza-shaped slice of crisp flatbread. Everything was fresh and tasted great.  Sausage and Pepperoni Flatbread: Crisp flatbread baked in a wood-fire oven comes topped with bits of sausage and pepperoni cut into four triangles.  Food deserves 4 stars. Service from Nicole M. deserves 5 stars as we only had happy hour items and raspberry iced tea, but she still treated us like any other guest, and ambience and happy hour menu deserve 5 stars. I have been to Brio Tuscan Grille about 5 times for their night time happy hour.  Give this place a shot if you haven't tried it yet for happy hour. You'll be surprised - pleasantly while enjoying the view of the Colosseum and the background Italian music that so dearly reminds me of Firenze, Italia.",

I've had a few of their entrees and they were all very good.  The risotto here is really tasty and one of my favorites.  My only gripe is the portion.  I've asked servers if they do half portions and they've always responded with an \"I don't know.\"  Don't know how hard it is to ask the chefs if its possible, but apparently it is.  For this reason I rarely ever order an entree to myself because it's such a waste.  I sometimes share one with my dining companion and the portion is enough to fill us both up.  The portions are definitely by the whole \"chain\" restaurant standard.  I think it would be nice to offer half portions for those who cannot devour a whole meal to themselves.  That said, I find myself coming more often just for their happy hour.  It's such an awesome deal.  $2.95 a plate!!!  They have a pretty big selection from their appetizers and the portions are still big enough to share that you won't need one plate for each person.  They also have $5 martinis.  The basil one is tasty but sorta too sweet.  I've also tried the sparkling raspberry and it's not so good.  It tasted like watered down raspberry vodka.  Happy hour is from Monday-Thursday (possibly Friday?) 3-7pm and again at 9-11pm.    Service is so, so.  Not the greatest but not the worst either.  Sometimes it seems like there's an excess of waitstaff.  I don't care too much of the ones I've gotten, they almost always seem rushed and uninterested.  The bar area is not that great either, but I dont expect much; it's whatevzzz.. can't complain at $2.95 lol.",

As another reviewer mentioned, I am not especially 'jazzed' to be writing a review for a chain like this.. but it is what it is.   Had this never been a part of Town Square I would not ever have heard of it I don't believe. So having said that.. I had come in for dinner a few times. I am that guy when it comes to a non-belief in \"American Style Italian\" or whatever Brio claims to be.  As for the quality of the food.. it isn't bad.. just nothing spectacular. Lately My friends and I have been dropping in for Happy hour on Thursdays as they have a $5 'martini' menu along side their daily happy hour of $2.95 'Tuscan Tasters'' ..   The thing is, they get so swamped with customers during happy hour, that the service gets seriously patchy. I'm totally down for someone hustling amongst the tables they are waiting on, just trying to do the job and make some descent money.. in fact I can appreciate it. It's the consistent mistakes on the bill, the negative attitude, especially fromt he bar staff, and the disregard for any style of customer service from the staff. There is constant conversation about everything but work, and in a very loud way.   I honestly know that this is literally a step in some direction from a place like 'Chili's\" or 'Friday's\" but with the environment of a bit higher end restaurant that they are trying to create.. you would hope for more is all I am saying.   In the end of it all, I would be back for the Happy Hour.. as it's good prices and descent nosh when you are shopping or heading to a movie.. but I think I will be looking for other options when I am next down at Town Square.

Direct from the menu...\"Angel hair with grilled chicken, tomatoes, pine nuts, basil, Parmigiano-Reggiano and pesto drizzle 14.15\"...yum. the pine nuts were a really nice touch.  what i dont understand though is why they dont have gingerale. the waitress was really sweet and tried to make it by mixing pepsi with sprite. but it didnt taste like gingerale. so i just had a pepsi.   overall really good for lunch. im told lunch here is better than dinner. who knows. get gingerale!",

It turned out to be much better than Zefferini, our fancy fine dining option the evening before which also happened to be Italian good.   Granted, Zefferini was interested in providing a more authentic Italian cuisine while Brio clearly catered to an un discerning American audience, but who cares! Why?  Part of our positive experience was the waitress we had, which is always appreciated in any establishment. Given the description above you would think she wouldn't know the wine list, right? Wrong. Not only did she had qualitative descriptions about their Tuscan Chiantis, but when she brought out samples of their by the glass range (another plus), her suggestion was spot on! (Winning Chianti selection was San Fabiano)  Her recommendation for a non-meat plate (Mediterranean penne?) was also a great choice. And the fresh sourdough bread made Zefferinis paltry store bought sliced broad baguette weep.   And always a huge warm smile.   One last point: we were in the back room which was intimate and quiet, though I could imagine the main salon would be quiet extremely noisy.   In sum, if you're looking for good food off the strip and aren't trying to crap shoot fine dining without a star, give Brio a try.",

They have large deserts if you want to share, or small ones if you want to have something different.  The area is nice to walk off your meal too.",

Even though the dinner rush had not even hit yet our waiter rarely came by our table.  They FORGOT our appetizer.  They brought out the bread basket late and with only half the bread.  Service was terrible.  Very disappointed since Brio has historically been one of my favorite places.",

    "text": "Okay, I get it - Brio is a chain and chains are supposed to be dull, and the menus uninspired. Obviously, Brio Tuscan Grille hasn't gotten that message.  We chose Brio from a host of other restaurants for a Welcoming Dinner for our son's wedding. The coordinator (Tiffany) could not have been nicer and more helpful. She walked us through the menu, choosing insalata, zuppa and entrees as well as passed appetizers. When asked, she easily recommended wines to compliment the other beverage offerings.  Last, but not least, she recommended a couple of bakeries to handle my request for a groom's cake. All of this over the phone or through emails.  Everything was excellent and the waitstaff was extremely attentive. We were able to reserve the Colosseum Room which was perfect for our group. We were able to choose 3 entrees for the group (they printed a menu for our guests) and chose Pasta Brio, Wood-Grilled Salmon and Tuscan Grilled Pork Chops - all excellent from the comments I heard. I can actually comment on the Pork Chop - excellent! We chose the Bruschetta, Beef Carpaccio Crostinis and Bacon Wrapped Shrimp for appetizers and they went over very well - especially the shrimp.  This is a great place to go if you want to escape the Strip. It is located just south of the airport off of Las Vegas Boulevard in Town Square a new shopping area which is quite nice as well. An excellent experience all around.",

I had the red fish with potatoes (daily special) my wife had the mushroom raviolli and our daughter had the pizza (of course!) The food seemed thoughtfully prepared and fresh.  The atmosphere was great for lunch and it was not overly crowded.  Our waitress was VERY attentive and our glasses were never empty.

I've had everything from pizza to pasta and fish and chicken here and its all been great.  The daily special menu usually has a fish dish on it which have always been great.  And if you stick around for after dinner, the creme brulee here is awesome, as is their coffee.  The brunch menu is also amazing... try the sausage florentine crepes... i'm getting hungry writing this.  Go there... you'll see.",

    "text": "We have been to Brio several times, and get mixed results - it really seems to depend on the server you get and how busy they are.    Yesterday, I was part of a party of 9, which I know is a challenge.  We arrived fairly early for lunch, and got very attentive service first-off.  The drinks, appetizers, and food all came out on time and tasted good.    Only complaint with the food was the portion-size on the \"crab & shrimp cakes\" -- the server said it was plenty, but what came out was two small cakes, not nearly enough for a guy who'd said they were hungry.  We did have a small water-incident, and asked for replacement napkins.  We asked again 10 minutes later before finally getting them.  Not such a huge problem -- they were hitting their peak of lunch-time.  One member asked for replacement utensils (I think he'd used both forks between appetizer and salad), which ended up taking a very long time to get as well.  As the meal came to a close (after coffee/cap/etc.), part of our group asked for sparkling water.  Over 15 minutes later, the server showed up with the check before the water arrived - they hurriedly brought the water, but the person felt like he'd been \"asked to leave\" at that point ...  Finally, as we're preparing to leave, the service staff began to refresh a table directly beside ours.  They \"snapped\" the tablecloth so hard that a cloud of lint and who-knows-what was clearly visible falling over our whole table.  All of the drinks were ruined (you could see the specks floating on top of them).  We tried to get the person's attention, but he did not notice us at all.  Worse yet, the manager was standing right next to him, and never noticed the issue.  When our server brought our disgust to her attention, she apologized by saying \"I'm sorry that bothered you\" rather than apologizing for the action.  No service-recovery was offered (nor requested by us).  We still like Brio but if we see that manager on duty, we'll turn around and leave.",

You receive warm bread that's freshly baked. Their lasagna was super rich but you could definitely taste all the cheeses and meat. The Filetto Di Manzo Toscano steak is always cooked perfectly! I have never had a steak cooked and done so well! We also asked for the grilled salmon which was just as delicious. All the plates came warm and in big portions. I recommend the peach sangria! You can't go wrong with any of their dishes. Fabulous work their chef is doing!",

The bread with the dip was yum. I ordered the Fettucini Napoli. It wasn't bad, but not great. I thought there was going to be chicken in my dish, i'm sure I read it had chicken in it, but all I got was ham as the meat. Kind of pricy for what I got, but I still ate it, with some hot sauce just because I was hungry. I probably won't eat hear again unless their was going to be a good reason for it. I am sure there are better places in the Town Square area where I ate.",

The service is usually top notch and professional.  However on this occasion my guest and I had to make ourselves laugh at the situation.    The hostesses let us know there would be a short wait which was no problem.  They were polite and welcoming.  A very short time afterwards a basket of bread was dropped off.  This is the kicker.  15-20 mins later we were greeted by our server.  I know this because a party of 10 was sat after us and proceeded to receive their first course before we even had water glasses or even a simple \"I'll be right with you\".  We noticed a manager walk by us 4 times and didn't notice we hadn't even been given waters.  The busser that had given us our bread must not have brought it to the server's attention.  At this time we were taking bets on the over under on how much longer it'd be before we were greeted.  So we got out our stopwatch and started clocking it from that moment.  Just from that moment we had an elapsed 4 mins.  I unfortunately lost the bet.  I had taken the over which was another 8 mins.  The meal went smoothly from that point on.  The chicken limone was amazing and my friend's filet was also enjoyed.    After a bottle of True grit petite Syrah, a salad course, main course, and dessert we left satisfied with our meal.  Just please work out the communication breakdowns.",

The food and service were top notch.  One dish stood out,  a vodka pasta plate was a big hit!  A very special praise to Nova the director of banquets.  A very sweet, understanding and helpful young man.  He was there for me when I was breaking down and nervous about the party. He is just perfect at what he does!  Thank you for a perfect day!

Eggs for my mother came out for a benedict almost completely raw.   Ended up eating mediocre bread for lunch. I guess in the end this place is no better than an Olive Garden just more expensive.",

I had the Chicken Limone which came with mashed potatoes and roasted veggies (zucchini, carrots, broccoli). It was a MASSIVE portion. It was delightful. I had moscato to drink and as a non-wine person, also delightful. The appetizer was the parmesan flatbread with artichoke dip. It was yummy. The Caesar salad was on the sad side, but the rest of the meal made up for it. I have no idea if the cake we had was by Brio or if it was brought in, but it was also wonderful.   If I was spending the day at the mall here, I would definitely stop by for dinner on my own dime.",

LOBSTER BISQUE - really good. Better to eat it slow because the spices can be strong and the taste may seem too powerful.   RAVIOLI DI BELLO - I highly recommend!!!! Some raviolis I've had are dry, or has little meat, or has a sauce that's either bland or overpowering. This ravioli is none of those. It's great! It has the right amount of meat inside. Sauce is tasty. The mushroom gives more flavor. The tomato cleanses the palate.   CAMPANELLE CARBONARA - It's good, but not the best I've had.   We both had wine too. Total came up to $60+.",

They were very accommodating and didn't even demand that we order off of the catering menu.  So we were able to sample from the dinner menu.    We were amazed that they were able to serve us all at the same time, the food was hot and everyone enjoyed their meal.    For 30 people that was a feat.  Service was exceptional.   The restaurant was beautiful.    Their mini desserts was wonderful as each of us could sample something yummy without overdosing on sugar.    Would highly recommend Brio Tuscan Grill to parties large and small - For special occasions, first dates and groups.",

It seemed frozen and not fresh. Sauces were not good. I had the pesce piccata, it was very dry and not pleasant tasting at all. The pasta fra diavlo was terrible. It looked like mac and cheese with shrimp.  The third person had the risotto, that was just okay, definitely not good.   Highlight was sangria and bread.   It's sad that we wasted some decent money on some bad food.",

There were no set-ups or appetizer plates. When the drinks arrived another 10 minutes later, one guest's drink was not there, and still no tableware.  It's not an inexpensive place, and this simply didn't bode well. We went for a nice walk and had a good dinner elsewhere...that's the beauty of Town Square, I suppose!",

Nothing to complain about other than my personal bias against chain restaurants as they all seem to have an institutional feel and there's never anything too exciting on the menu, just stuff that appeals to the masses. Overall pretty good and reasonable price for what you get. Good spot for lunch.",

    "text": "Came here for a Sunday brunch. To begin, parking was obviously chaotic at the fun-filled Town Square. I parked far but enjoyed my stroll over to the restaurant. Once we got to the restaurant, we were asked to wait a few minutes to get our outside table ready. The restaurant is large and well-decorated. I loved the high ceilings and it could be the elder, classier sister of Cheesecake Factory. We asked to be seated outside and the waitress who walked us over was kind and let us pick the table we preferred. Our main waitress, Sophia, was on her third day at the job. She was kind, fun, and considerate. She was respectful and did her very best to provide suggestions and answer questions. The other waiters were very kind, too. The starter bread was awesome, especially the thin, crunchy triangular crackers. The food was good though it was a little cold and could have used more flavor. I got the Margherita flatbread while my friend got the Lasangna that came with a salad. Each of us paid roughly $15 for our meal. One thing I really liked about the restaurant was that the  menu had the calories written on it--helps a lot for the health-conscious people at an Italian restaurant! All in all, food was good but the experience is what would make us come back again. Fun place to do people-watching at, especially while sitting outside!",

Our party was there EXACTLY on time but we had to wait just under 10 minutes until the hostess figured out where to seat us...so what's the point of a reservation? Minus 1 1/2 star.  After we were seated, no one came to our table and acknowledged us for 10 more minutes. Huge customer service mistake. The waitress finally showed up but she should've had the bus person bring water and bread while she was taking our drink orders. Again Brio's management, customer service was underwhelming. Minus 1 star.  The drinks were served and our food order was taken then delivered.  1.) Shrimp Mediterranean..5 med/small shrimp on skewer. Small portion, o.k. flavor. 2.) Lasagna..the two members of our party liked the flavor, not the portion. 3.) Spaghetti in red sauce..it's spaghetti, what else can I say. 4.) Veal Milanese...basically chicken fried steak with a small side of pasta. Not worth  it for me. Flavor was nothing special. Pasta was plain.  Meal = Minus 1 1/2 star.  Flavor, portion and presentation are all lacking.  Overall = Total of 1 star given. Brio's is 100% geared towards tourist who would probably never come back so the attention and details of the staff and quality of the food is not a concern. I will also never come back or recommend Brio's to my friends. This is a customer service town with a lot of choices, first impression counts when it comes to where I spend my money.",

We waited 20 mins for the server to come back. We asked him for another box and the check. We proceeded to wait another ten mins before we were paid out and ready to leave.

Once you come in, there's kind of like, an Italy-feel atmosphere. Which I love because it feels like I'm eating lunch or dinner somewhere in Italy.   Their service is PERFECT, they're very welcoming and always introducing themselves in a friendly manner. I come here too often to the point where they recognized who I am and my order, kind of embarrassing but at the same time, am proud to be a regular!   Unto the food, so far I've only tried their tuscan grilled pork chops, beef carpaccio (this appetizer is a MUST), filet mignon, and some pasta. ALL of it were perfectly cooked. I'm very picky when it comes to eating meat and I'm just so glad I found a restaurant that are consistent with grilling their steaks. Although, I've been ordering my usual (pork chops and carpaccio) the last couple of visits, I think it's time to expand my options, but I shouldn't have to worry about getting something that I won't like because brio never disappoints. I highly recommend this place!",

They have a patio with fireplace outside and during cooler weather it is very relaxing to jus sit there and have a glass of wine. The food is delicious. It's a great place to entertain guests or meet up with friends. They also have a location in Summerlin but I love the architecture and design of this restaurant. I recommend all the pasta and salad. They have a variety of selections of desserts as well. I love the salmon salad or the salmon dinner. It gets very busy in this place everyday, if you're a walk in is not a good idea unless you are just going to drink and sit by the bar. I recommend to make a reservation although when you have a reservation you will have to wait a minimum of 20 minutes till you get seated and maximum of 30min as it seems like they overbook.",

I haven't had anything that I didn't enjoy & whenever I bring people over who are first timers they become instant fans. I also need to mention that they have a fantastic happy hour even though I didn't participate in this particular visit. Some of my favorite items are; the balsamic strawberry salad, the lobster bisque & the margherita flat bread.  The service has also been great on every visit so I highly recommend this place. Outdoor dining is also a must on nice days or evenings.",

The restaurant really has a nice feel and would be perfect if the staff were more attentive and the food faire was better thought out by the Chefs.  First, we were seated for 7 minutes before our server approached us.   Second, the temperature inside the restaurant was uncomfortably warm and stale.  Third, the meals.....My wife had the shrimp and lobster pasta.  We counted 6 small shrimp and mere flakes of what appeared to be lobster.  The sauce was good, but the pasta was the main attraction not the seafood.  I had the crab cakes.  They were just ok.  Two small crab cakes atop a mound of fingerling potatoes and green beans.  The main course was the potatoes.    The olive oil and vinegar cruets were disgustingly sticky and I asked them to be replaced.  They were without hesitation by our server, but it's obvious they are infrequently cleaned which is concerning.   We had high expectations but were sadly disappointed.  We won't be back.    I got an private message and gave the Mgr my phone number many days ago. Never got a call.  So my recommendation has gone down to 2 stars.",

We arrived and we were taken to the back for the reception in a big open room. Food took a while but it was worth the wait! We received two different salads. One was a blue cheese with bacon and the other was your normal Caesar salad. Next came was fruits slices of grapes, blue berries, pineapples, and watermelon. The entrees finally came and it was freaking insane! We had asparagus seared with salsa salmon, creamy mashed potatoes, filet mignon, and their house pasta. The chicken pasta was my favorite dish because I had never eaten anything like it. Super delicious was the steak, tender and juicy with each bite. The salmon was a bit dry and the asparagus was sweet and crunchy.  Desert was a little coffee cup with cream, caramel, and cake. Very good place to eat and I would definitely go there again!",

    "text": "Came in for happy hour with one of my good friends. As I entered the hostess at the stand asked me the basic seating questions once I informed her I was coming in for Happy Hour she changed her tone informed me that Happy Hour seating is at the bar or by the fire pit.   As I walked around LOST the employees just continued to watch me walk back and fourth. I was alone still waiting on my friend and you can clearly see it in my expression that I couldn't find a seat. I had to ask someone for help who then also told me to look on the other side where there is another fire pit. Ok I get it, it's Happy Hour and seating is first come first serve but what's the point of having guest walk in and out feeling lost when you can have some type of organization to it?  Finally when I sat down it took about 10 minutes for someone to ask me what I wanted to drink and I guess they don't give you menus until you ask for one? This is the 4th time I have came here. It was my first time for Happy Hour and everytime I can't help but feel as if the staff be littles their guest. I clearly come back for the food and not the service!   Happy Hour was definitely worth it! Great prices, good portions so as far as the quality in their food it's great! They need to work on better customer service skills. I have had better service at fast food restaurants then I've had here. It obviously wasn't a bad day for them cause 4 out of 4 tries the service just keeps getting worse.",

But the waiters were patient, and they managed their time wisely.  The food was delicious. I love how each table gets a nice basket of bread before the entrees. I ordered the Roasted Red Pepper Bruschetta, which is more on the light side of the menu. It was satisfying and not too overwhelming.   The atmosphere was casual. Although the interior design of the restaurant was elegant and formal, there were several people that ranged from t-shirts and shorts to tuxedos and dresses. I do love how fancy Brio looks, though. I enjoyed looking at the architecture and the design of the restaurant.   I knocked off one star because although the food was delicious, it wasn't a 100% wow factor. Maybe if I tried something more exotic / new off of the menu, I would give this restaurant the 5 stars it deserves. Overall, I would probably come here again.",

Me and two coworkers went here after work on Friday around 1:30pm and we just had sangria and appetizers. We sat outside in Town Square because the weather was beautiful. We ordered the white peach sangria, which was excellent beyond belief. I'm typically a red sangria person because the others are too sweet but this was just perfect. I ordered the steak bruschetta. My goodness. It was so awesome. It had a touch of Gorgonzola cheese on it but it wasn't too strong as it sometimes can be. It had arugula and Parmesan. The steak was so tender and flavorful. I was legitimately impressed.   Our service was very good and attentive as well and she split the check three ways for us which I appreciated...considering this is sometimes a painful task.   I was glad we sat outside where is was quiet and shaded. I saw a glimpse of the inside and it just wasn't inviting. It looked dark and loud.",

I ordered a Caesar salad and the lobster with shrimp risotto. My salad never showed up and my risotto was still hard. The lobster was cooked perfectly. I will also add that my peach sangria was wonderful. Our deserts were pretty tasty. Overall I wouldn't go back.",

This place was jam packed (on a Thursday, 7:00p).  Maybe because martinis were $5 a pop?    Our server was friendly and informative.  I was scared my friend wouldn't enjoy the food because she is vegitarian.  My girlfriend and I ordered the roasted red pepper and mozzarella bruschetta (which was delicious!) and the mushroom ravioli (to die for).  We couldn't say no when he brought the dessert tray.  Bread pudding warm and glorious!  All in all, a success.",

She had no personality nor did she try to up sell a single item on the menu. I like to offer my guests a glass of wine or a beverage to start. It seems like she just wanted us out of there because we had 2 young teens with us. I felt like we were rushed and not given the proper service we deserved. I made a reservation through open table and noted a birthday.. She could've at least greeted us with a happy birthday? Instead when dessert time came around she just left the dessert menu on the table without even explaining to us what was on it. I'll be back for the food.. But definitely get out of Rachel's section! I have better customer service at McDonald's. At least the workers there smile and are polite. I'm now on my way to have drinks elsewhere",

What I love about the Brio is that they have a variety of dishes that I find delish!  From their Beef Carpaccio to their Eggplant & Shrimp appetizer to their perfect pasta! Just love them... if you go during the week, you can catch their Happy Hour & get the Beef Carpaccio for $2.95, baby! Yes, I said it! I went one early evening  for appies (appetizers) & drinks with my girlfriend and our bill was a mere $30 something when we finished! How can you beat that? We noshed on the Carpaccio, Shrimp cocktail and wine!  Also, the environment is great - I love chilling by the outside bar on the lovely spring / summer evenings... always a Gem in my book!  to be more up to date: Saturday, 29 Jan 2011 was date night - even tho our mood was less than nice... we still enjoyed our meal! :)  your constant companion,  ~dee",

The kids alfredo pasta was my son's favorite also, he ate most of his dish. I had the pasta pesto and didn't like it at all. The sauce was so runny and hardly had any pesto on it. I tasted mostly tomatoes. The chicken was the only thing that was edible on the dish. I wouldn't get it again and we'll probably be back for more of the pork chops!",

It's very pretty and romantic inside, so it's a nice place for a date or a bachelorette party.   We ordered the chicken milanese and the sausage pomodoro. Both dishes came out fairly quickly, and tasted wonderful! It's probably hard to go wrong with any of the dishes though.. everything smells really good! I also opted for the peach bellini, which was fruity, sweet, and totally did not have a hint of alcohol!   They also have a pretty good menu for happy hour on weekdays! :)",

    "text": "** YELP 100 CHALLENGE: 046/100 **  On our last Vegas trip, my boyfriend and I were in the plaza planning to watch Captain America: The Winter Soldier. We were starving, so we decided to look for somewhere to eat afterwards. Using my trusty Yelp app, I found that Brio Tuscan Grille was one of the highest rated restaurants in the plaza that was still open at that hour, so off we went!  The ambience and decor of Brio Tuscan Grille felt very classy and upscale. We weren't too dressed up, so we felt slightly out of place. However, our service remained top notch, and everyone was very nice, friendly, and attentive. Brio Tuscan Grille is a great place I'd recommend if you want a hearty Italian dinner. My boyfriend and I loved everything we ordered, which was the following:  -Roasted Garlic, Spinach, and Artichoke Dip: One of my favorite appetizers, so I usually always order this.. and Brio's is definitely one of my favorites I've had so far! The Parmesan flatbread they provide for dipping tasted so cheesy, crisp, and perfect. It was a good blend of flavors with the spinach dip, which was neither too salty or bland. Usually restaurants serve tortilla chips with spinach/artichoke dip, so I thought Brio's upgrade to parmesan flatbread was a very nice touch. Highly recommend! - Lobster Bisque: Very creamy and filling. The lobster bisque I've had in the past had a stronger tomato, tangy taste. Brio's version is definitely more creamy and thick. While I liked it, it was probably too heavy to eat in conjunction with the spinach/artichoke dip. - Pasta BRIO: I honestly don't remember this dish too well, since it's been months. However, we ordered this to share per recommendation of our server. I do remember the sauce being very savory and delicious, and I most likely enjoyed it. It's supposedly their signature dish, so I assume it's one of their more popular pastas.  Overall, I enjoyed my first dining experience at Brio Tuscan Grille. I usually don't like eating at Italian restaurants, because I'm never blown away by their dishes. However, Brio exceeded my expectations, and I highly recommend it to anyone in the area. If you're fan of spinach/artichoke dip, definitely order this as well!",

Went for brunch on a Sunday and our group was seated fairly quickly. The clean and beautiful decor captured my eye. There was a bridal shower going on next to our table and they were taken care of nicely by the servers.  Our waitress and waiter were attentive and friendly. Started off with bread and butter, would have liked some oil and vinegar because that makes me think Italian. After looking at their menu for 15 minutes, because I couldn't decide from all the amazing choices, I ordered the Tuscany Harvest Salad. Came with grilled chicken,  mushrooms, bacon, almonds, Gorgonzola cheese, apples, dried cranberries, crispy lavoush, and Tuscan dressing. It was DELICIOUS!   I still had room for dessert and their dessert platter had a nice variety so I went with the BRIO's Famous Cheesecake which was creamy and topped with caramalized sugar and creme anglaise. Every bite I took made me fall in love all over again.   Their brunch menu has some great choices and I would not mind returning to this place or hosting a dinner party. Good choice, glad we yelped it. It's located in a town center so parking can be a pain but there are plenty of shops to walk around in.",

He even brought over complimentary tiramisu for the both of us, which was delicious. I had the Vodka pasta and my boyfriend had the lasagna, both were absolutely amazing. My favorite part of the evening, besides the wonderful server, was the atmosphere of the restaurant. There are lights strung in the trees and you really feel at home. Coming from a couple who dines out frequently, please don't hesitate to visit Brio in Town Square, you won't regret it. And ask for Craig, I cannot put into words just how wonderful he really was.",

Well we went and was quite disgusted about the way they handle the seating arrangements for happy hour. You can have happy hour at the bar or at designated tables with fire pits on the patio ONLY. Oh you can sit at a table right next to the ones with a fire pit, a mere 3 inches away; but you have to order from a regular menu and pay full price. Who's hair brain idea is this? Poor business practice and well, just plain fucking stupid. So save yourself the frustration and go to Tommy Bahamas or the Blue Martini as every table and person is offered the happy hour menu and pricing regardless of where you sit, just so long as you go during the designated hours. I'm still in shock.  Completely disappointed.  I'm spreading the word to any one that will listen. I will never give this place one dime and I would encourage those reading this to do the same. They need a new business plan and manager.",

I ordered a prosciutto sandwich and a lobster bisque soup. The sandwich did not have any prosciutto on it and was mostly slimy cheese and the soup was extremely salty and I think there was a hair in it. A friend of mine is vegan and ordered a plain salad with just vegetables in it and they charged her $20 for it. She brought it up to the waitress and she said it was because it was a modified salmon salad... But she didn't have salmon in it which is the most expensive part. We also waited 40 minutes for our food and it wasn't even right. It came with items she didn't ask for and it took an additional ten minutes for the waitress to bring her side of salad dressing. It's a shame that the food isn't great because the place is really nice and has patio seating.",

However, I came here for lunch with my coworkers & I didn't realize they have a lunch menu (from $10 -$17), and their prices are very reasonable. It's not fast food cheap, but for its quality & ambience, it's definitely worth it.  Overall, servers have been nice & check up on my party in a timely manner. However the food takes a little longer to come out compared to other restaurants. Nonetheless, their complimentary bread & crackers satisfy one's appetite while waiting.  Honestly, everything on their menu is pretty tasty & delicious.",

    "text": "I'm a sucker for good service. Brio delivered.  Once we got seated, we were shortly after greeted by our server with two waters. Seems small, but understand the difference between being asked would you like a water, and the anticipatory service of deciding for you, \"here is a water. You need it to live. Drink it... or not. It's there for you to decide.\"   Our server was a bald, white gentleman who referred to me as \"my man\" a lot. It made me feel like he was the Caucasian Denzel Washington straight out of 'Training Day,' and if I'm being honest... I didn't hate it. Endearment aside, he was also incredibly attentive, hospitable, and patient with my indecisiveness. More on that here:  I couldn't decide what to eat. The menu was one page long but it was intimidating. I'm an Olive Garden loving Italian food kind of guy (aka basic AF). I wasn't ready for foods I've never heard of, cheeses I can't even pronounce, etc. It seems all to much for me. Our server quickly took note of that and took it upon himself to create a pasta order from scratch collaboratively with me. It was incredibly kind of him to do. Shout out to the White Denzel! He's a real one.  I ended up getting a fettuccine pasta with both alfredo AND marinara sauce, with an order of grilled chicken breast and grilled shrimp as add ons and that meal was F-I-R-E! I probably would have been the loser that came here for soup and bread if it wasn't for him out of sheer intimidation.   I'll be back for happy hour next time. I hear its poppin.",

We live less than 10 away and this was a frequent stop for lunch. The Chicken Marsala was as dry as the Las Vegas desert with literally 2 dollops of sauce on top. It was over cooked, sent back, and replaced by the Pasta Brio that was as cold as ice except for the center of the plate. Do they haphazardly throw things in the microwave now? The kids spaghettini and meat sauce was always a winner with my 6 year old. What happened to that sauce? It was delicious previously, buttery and creamy, and perfect enough for adults to enjoy it. The service was equally disappointing. Our server looked like she wanted to jump off a bridge. For a Town Square sweetheart this is not acceptable! Is it going out of business or just dreadfully unmanaged?",

So it's a big piece of wedge lettuce as a whole, topped with bacon, tomatoes, blue cheese and their house made Parmesan dressing! This dressing is amazing! It's what has me addicted to this salad. I usually order this as a main course with grilled chicken and it is amazing! It's a great meal!   Also their bread is addicting!! I love their flatbread, it's a top grains and Parmesan. It's delicious!   I have yet to be disappointed with the service and quality of food. The atmosphere is serene, it can be an upscale classy dinner or it can be casual. I love the patio seating at night and it's a great environment to hang out with friends.   BTW they have happy hour at 9PM to closing!! It's worth it!",

We mentioned it to the server and he gave us a sheepish look and ended up bringing out a couple more skinny shrimp.   The remainder of the dishes were on point and properly sized.

The last time we ate at Brio for lunch, we were starving so we ordered an appetizer, entree, and dessert.   Steak Bruschetta - The bread and arugula tasted so fresh and the steak had great seasoning. I definitely recommend ordering this for your appetizer!   Pasta Carbonara - My boyfriend loves ordering carbonara whenever we go out for Italian food and has ordered it from Brio in the past. However, the carbonara during this visit was very bland and tasted like it needed more seasoning.   Pasta Alla Vodka - Delicious! The creamy marinara sauce was very flavorful and the ricotta filled ravioli were so good. I'm definitely going to be ordering this next time.  Chocolate Molten Lava Cake - One of the best lava cakes we've ever had. The caramel sauce and vanilla ice cream paired perfectly with the rich chocolate lava cake. We scarfed down the dessert within minutes.   Overall, Brio is an excellent Italian restaurant and the quality of the food and service is always up to par.",

I have tried pasta, sandwiches and steaks, all of which didn't impress.  Tonight, the fettuccine was mush, stuck together and pasty.  It was obvious that my shrimp and lobster fettuccine was the first of five entrees complete and sat too long.  As they served, they handed me my plate and told me watch out, it is very hot.  Wait, what?   How about doing your job and presenting my entree to me on the table.  More disturbing, I ordered a bottle of wine.  The server poured and I took a couple of sips. I them noticed a two inch crack in the glass.  These things happen, but the waiter wanted to pour the wine from the cracked glass into another glass.  Wait, what?  (Again)  Overall, mediocre food, mediocre service, VERY LOUD ATMOSPHERE and pretty pricy.  Go to Olive Garden and save your cash.",

    "text": "I'm sorry in advance for the review that I'm about to post. ... may no one ever feel like the way we felt yesterday.  I have been to this Brio many times for the restaurant and not happy hour. Yesterday we came for happy hour at the bar because we've heard SOOO many good things about it. We heard that service was good, food was even better, and the drinks were worth it... I mean look at other reviews. I always HATE to be THAT person. SO it cringes me to write this review.  We come in and the bar booths are all full. The tables next to the bar are full. So we opt to go outside. There's one table open but kind of in an awkward spot so we decide to sit at the bar that's located outside. We were sitting there for about 10 minutes before anyone even acknowledged us. We felt like... why isn't anyone coming to us? And there was a couple that had just finished to the right of us. So we knew we were allowed to sit there. Finally, a bar back (not a bartender) actually acknowledges us and gives us menus. Still from there, no bar tender. We decide to go back inside and find a spot inside of the bar. Finally two chairs but still no attention from anyone. We see at least three bar tenders catering to other people. At this point we're thinking \"are we invisible?\" Finally some guy (after about 20 minutes of being there) asks \"Can I see your IDs?\" checks them, and asks if he want something to drink. No hello. No how's it goin. Uh, okay. We order the our drinks and they come out. WE ask if we can order food. I don't know, does he not care that we're paying customers here? We ordered Beef Carpaccio and the new Nachos to start. While waiting for the food I had to get his attention to ask for lemons which took forever to get. I could see them right there, I felt like I could just grab them myself. The food came out. I liked the Beef Carpaccio but it was pretty salty. The nachos weren't nacho chips but potato chips (never seen that before). Interesting. We wanted to get the flatbread but then again it takes forever to get their attention to order something. Finally getting his attention, we ordered the pepperoni and sausage flat bread. Very dry.   We had our receipt already because he kept printing out the tab every time we ordered something. Okay, that's good at least we didn't have to ask for the check. But paying took forever. My boyfriend had the payment out for quite a long time. No one acknowledge it and finally another person who wasn't catering to us came and grabbed it.  Overall, I was very disappointed with the service and quality of the food. The drinks were okay. And I definitely am shocked to have had a very different experience than all of my friends. I seem to always have bad experience at bars. I don't understand if it's because I look young or what. But that's how it feels most of the time. I promise I'd tip well if you'd treat me well. But this wasn't the case, again.",

No joke, it's extremely appealing and favorable to the eye. Also, there's tasty candy on your way out by the door. Snatch a pack and enjoy the final touch of your dining experience.  Pros: Delicious food, well priced, great decor, great service, free wifi, takes reservations, clean bathrooms  Cons: Food takes some time to reach the table  Overall: I'll see you shortly!

As for drinks, the \"Sangria Rosa\" & \"White Peach Sangria\" are my go-to. They're only $4 & they taste amazing.  Shout-out to Danielle who has been my server a few times & is wonderful!",

By the time they were back I didn't have time to order food.  I told the server that and still had to wait what seemed a long time for the check.   Today I stopped in again with my wife.   Very cold reception at the door and when brought to the table.   No welcome or greeting.   Our server was friendly at first but I guess our two course lunches were too much to remain pleasant for.   We loved the food and building but not the service.",

I came here for dinner with my mom and her friend and we started with a round of drinks at the bar. I ordered my usually Moscow Mule and was underwhelmed. Maybe it's because I had been sick a little earlier in the week, but it definitely did not rank as one of my top favorites.   The food totally made up for the drink though!! We started with the Calamari and the Bruschetta Trio Sampler. I've never had bruschetta, but I really enjoyed it, especially the one with the prosciutto, ricotta and bell peppers. I think this was the chef special for the night, but I hope it's available for more than one night.   For dinner, I had the Lobster and Shrimp Fettuccini and WOW YALL. So good!! Slight spice, wonderfully creaminess and a portion that was out of this world ($22.50 I believe and I still took some home).   For dessert, we had the New York Style Cheesecake and Creme Brulee. I love me a good creme brulee, and this was def one of the best ones I've had. I wouldn't have ever come to this restaurant on my own, so I'm really glad my mom and her friend decided to take a different route for dinner.",

It can get crowded therefore; consider making reservations for dinner.  For dinner, I often get the Lasagne which is always outstanding.  They also have many popular wines which I'm sure you will enjoy.   Very good food and great service...check it out!!",

With the weather warming up it was a great drink to have.   For my entree I ordered the pasta alla vodka and the sauce is AMAZING!!! I had to ask for more bread so I could dip it. One of our party had the lobster and shrimp fettuccine and it was good but I bought a bit too cheesy for my taste.   Either way this place isn't as salty as other Italian establishment and I will definitely come back maybe for their great happy hour!!",

Honestly it was on par with Olive Garden (and that's not saying much). The portions were very small for the amount I paid. The Carbonara was $17 and it was a pretty small portion. I don't mind paying $17 for spaghetti but it better be a pretty damn good spaghetti. My husbands meal was the same...just okay. My carbonara had huge chunks of bacon (they should be pancetta and very crispy) and the bacon wasn't even fully cooked  I guess it doesn't help that my husband and I lived in Italy for 5 years. He warned me about eating Italian anywhere in the US. Won't be going back! Unless it's for happy hour. I've been once and it was nice. Which is why I have Brio 2 stars.",

In this package, it includeed a choice of salad, entree, sourdough bread and flaxseed crackers. I ordered the ceasar salad and chicken limon.   Other than getting an email confirmation, I never checked with them until I showed up. I'm lowering a star because there is NO easy in and out access parking. Had to find a parking structure and park on the second level to get to this place and let me tell you, the bags were HEAVY!!! Thank goodness I was lucky to have a man with me to help me carry it! lol  Food was ready and HOT when I got there and it only took a minute for me to get it in my hands. They just wanted to confirm how many people was in my party so they can pack the serving ware etc.   Got to the place about 25 minutes later and the food was still hot! I was impressed how fresh and tasty everything was. They did not skimp on the salad dressing, butter, limon sauce, crackers, utensils, plates, napkins...everything! It made it easy and it definitely fed MORE than 4-5 people! But maybe because it was a potluck party? lol   Everyone who had it, enjoyed it and said they will definitely go to this restaurant.

Most of my cowokers opted for pasta dishes - which is probably what they are known for - but I went with a grilled salmon salad. Originally I was gonna get the salmon salad entree, but when I asked the server if it was the same amount of salmon on the entree vs. the salad - she said it was exactly the same. So why not save a few bucks and get some greens in the process? Salad it is! The waitress was nice enough, though, to bring the pesto vinaigrette out with it that originally came with the entree.   The salad itself was tasty. I thought they used a LOT of shoestring potatoes, but I guess it was to give it some height and make it look bigger? I probably could have done without so many, but then again I did eat them all so what does that say about me?  I also had their lobster bisque. It was okay, but I don't know if I'd get it again. It was too peppery and there was just the faintest chunk of lobster in there- nothing to write home about.   All of my coworkers seem to enjoy their meals and had no complaints.",

We did return for lunch shortly after and service was much better. B&B plates were actually on the table, and the chef even made me a vegan friendly pasta. Thank you Jesse for the hospitality!",

    "text": "Our last night in Las Vegas and we met my cousin at the Brio Tuscan Grille.   My first visit to a Brio restaurant.   Very impressed with the layout.  We were quickly seated towards the back and our waitress Jen was fantastic - personable, funny, witty, and very knowledgeable about the menu.  When I saw crab cakes on the menu under appetizers, my mind was immediately made up.  They were very good - but I'm a sucker for crab cakes - they are always delicious.   Brio's were very nice because they didn't have a lot of junky fillers and were very crabby.   The serving size was perfect for me.   Exquisite!   D had the lasagna.  The portion was large enough to end hunger.   After eating for a while (and not making a dent), D asked me to try it and it was very good.   He felt so bad for not finishing all of it, but he was stuffed and unfortunately, we were on flight home the next morning.  The service and food were outstanding.   I can wish they open a Brio Tuscan Grill in Kalamazoo some day.",

This is a great date place, only because women really like it, as a matte fact I may be the first male to review this place. And the only reason I have ever been here is because of a date many months ago. (the date turned out badly, the meal however was quite good). So fellas take your lady here, you will both be happy. Oh I almost forgot download their app for groovy deals and offers. Live it up you are in Las Vegas for cryin' out loud!",

I've went to multiple locations and love where the owners have chosen to build the restaurants. Will definitely continue to go to brio.",

We had mostly drinks but ordered a couple appetizers too including the margherita flatbread. Everything on the happy hour menu is priced between $4-$6 and the drinks seemed decently strong. The flatbread was nice and crunchy and a pretty good size. Service was efficient and our server kept coming back to check on us the entire time we were there. Our food and drinks came out pretty fast. I was impressed and would definitely come back to check out their full menu",

I had the pasta brio which was good, from what I remember. And my friend Vanessa had the grilled salmon angel hair pasta.

I had a horrible birthday and the absolute worst experience that I've ever had at any establishment. When we immediately entered there were three young hostesses just standing around chitchatting, we stood there for a few seconds before we were even greeted. Finally after their \"worthy\" conversation was over we were greeted and escorted to our table. We were seated with no silverware, the waiter came over, took our drink orders, and we ordered an appetizer and also got served the appetizer without any silverware. We didn't receive silverware until my girlfriend walked up to the hostess stand to request the silverware. It became immediately obvious that our waiter was just not having a good night and was overwhelmed. The service that he provided was horrible, he didn't take the time to check on us after we got our food, and we had to wave for him to see that we needed a refill on our drinks. I ordered my favorite dish and it seemed as if they were either low on ingredients or that they had served me the leftovers from another diner's plate. The portion was very small and on all my other visits I had never seen such a small portion of this dish, which was my favorite dish to order. Prior to arriving at the restaurant my girlfriend had also called to advise them that it was my birthday and she requested a birthday dessert. While at the restaurant she even notified the hostesses and requested for them to please notify our waiter that it was my birthday and once again requested the birthday dessert. Needless to say the message wasn't relayed to our waiter and all he brought to our table was the check. Finally fed up with the terrible customer service we requested to speak to a manager and the manager Megan came over. Prior to her coming over to speak with us we were disappointed with the lack of communication and poor service, but not too upset. However, Megan absolutely added fuel to the fire and made the night and my special occasion even worst. She was very sarcastic and EXTREMELY dismissive of our concerns and complaints. Her solutions to the issues were her sarcastic jokes & remarks, a very poor attempt at an apology, and a free dessert card. The experience was terrible and truly was the absolute worst dining experience and attempt at celebrating my special day. Prior to this experience everyone who knows me knew that Brio was my favorite restaurant in town and that I would visit this location 6-8 times yearly, and even ordered catering to go orders for events at work, but based on this experience and especially the way that we were treated by Megan I will NEVER again visit this restaurant or any other location. I've already deleted the rewards app with unused rewards because the experience was so bad that I truly will never ever visit any Brio restaurant ever again. Great job guys... the ball was completely dropped on this night! Worst experience ever!!!!",

We asked to be seated outside and were quickly seated.  We were quickly fogotten.  After waiting for some time, a nice himsel man introduces himself and takes our drink order but never returns. This keeps happening over and over.  Finally we get someone and we ask for drinks before we order.    We had to keep asking for the bread basket but they kept forgetting. The server didn't know the soup of the day.  Finally we ordered and our food came. The dressing on my Field Greens salad was too heavy on the vinegar and the salad was drenched to the point that the greens were soggy!  My soup got cold because no one brought me a spoon and I had to ask a couple times. No one brought me any crackers, offered pepper or cheese for the soup or salad, or my friends omlette.  Our drinks were often empty.    Fortunately the manager walked by and we were able to share about our experience.  He was too kind and comped our meal, but I am quite reluctant to return to this location.",

    "text": "July 2, 2011 Saturday - dinner 8:30 PM 2 adults and a teenager  Atmosphere - 4 stars Food - 2 stars Service - 1 star  Background - After a long day of driving from Reno we wanted Italian close to our hotel.  Atmosphere - The best thing going with this place.  Lofting ceilings with great colors covering the walls make for a warm inviting place.  Food Appetizer - Free bread came in a small basket, it contained three triangular cracker thin bread slices covered in seasoning and a chuck of soft bread.  The cracker bread was seasoned, looked, and tasted like pizza.   They could have offered to bring more bread when it was gone.  If I was eating some pasta as my meal I would have liked it to arrive without me begging.   Main Course - They did not have any stuffed pasta that I was interested in.  So I went with the sliced steak salad.  The steak was over peppered and the medallion pieces needed to be cut.  The lettuce was nothing special, mostly iceberg chopped into small squares.  The highlight of the meal was the candied pecans.  This comment you could put under service or here, the menu indicates that steak will be cooked to order.  The waiter  never asked and I forgot as it took a long time to place our meal order with him.  Dessert - skipped it    Service - This was really lacking.  The floor was simply nasty.  Noodles all over the floor next to wear I sat.  As we sat there I noticed a Gatorade bottle on the floor next to me after the lady at the next table over placed in on the floor before they left.  The busy boy must have not noticed it as he kicked it under the table.  I typically only drink water with my meal now, and when you fill a 12 ounce glass completely with ice, you better be coming back with more water frequently.  But not the case here, only once was my water refilled, placing the glass at the edge of the table should all I have to do.   As we were finishing up our meal, a different bus boy took care of the other table next to us.  The table was covered in a table cloth.  When he placed the new one on the table it was like he was making a bed up and down with cloth.  I know it was a hot night but I really do not need a table cloth fan next to me.",

If you arrive at happy hour, the deals at the bar are amazing.  $3.95 for 3 deep fried cheese raviolis for example.  They also serve mojitos and sangria on top of all the regular bar drinks.  For dinner, their pasta is good.  I had the lobster bisque and it was good, but I enjoyed their tomato bisque even better... but I don't think it's always available.  Overall, it's a classy place at a just above average price range.  Most dishes are $10 - $20.  I think it's a step above Olive Garden and Macaroni Grille...",

    "text": "I wish YELP would change the definition of 3 stars from \"A-OK\" to \"Just OK\" since they don't have 2.5 stars.  I was shopping in Town Square and Brio looked like the only non-fast food choice for lunch.  The atmosphere, decor, and service really deserve 4 stars.  They loose 1.5 stars for the food.  I ordered a large Caesar salad, and a Mediteranean Penne dish.   I had the option to get a small salad with the entre for an additional $3.85, but the waiter said it was pretty small so I asked for the large salad entre (which was supposed to cost a whopping $11.00).   The salad came in a large plate which was half empty.  I love Caesar salad, but this one was mediocre at best.  Hardly any flavor.   And the description bragged about the house dressing and brioche croutons  - both tasteless.  When I finished the waiter asked how I liked the salad, and seemed very surprised when I told him that it was bland.   The only good news was that they didn't charge me $11,00 for the salad, but only $5.00, though I don't know if this was because of what I said about it.  The penne dish was pasta with mushrooms, dried tomatoes and fetta and a very little bit of a tasteless sauce.   This is one of those places where if you ask for parmesan cheese, the waiter makes a show of grinding it on your pasta.   I suppose they want you to think this is entertainment, but I think it is really just a way for them to save money on cheese.   As you watch, they grind and grind and grind, and when they're done you may have a teaspoon or two of cheese on your pasta.   For what this dish cost ($15.15) they could have put a dish of cheese on the table - it might have helped an otherwise boring meal.  The only bright side of lunch was excellent sour dough bread which tasted like San Francisco sour dough, but they told me it was shipped in daily from Los Angeles.  $25.00 plus tip with ice tea.   I think I would have done better at Olive garden.",

There are dramatic high ceilings with beautifully draped material flowing from the rafters.  The place is huge and although there is a wait at times, it moves along quickly.  The food has been consistently good. Being Italian, I dislike Italian chain restaurants, but this is not one of them.  The ravioli is superb as is all of their pasta dishes judging from the reaction of our guests and our own experience.  Their desserts are wonderful, and they even have \"tapas\" size to make you feel less guilty.  The newest location in Summerlin is smaller and a little less showy than the Town Square site. However, this just makes it a totally different experience; same great food, but \"cozier\" feel.  Lots of fun on a Saturday when the Farmers Market sets up at the site!  For lunch or dinner, this place is a sure hit.",

They have a full bar and happy hour and a wonderful outdoor seating area where you can people watch while enjoying your meal. I have a great affinity for the flatbread that comes in their bread basket. Crispy triangles that are coated in herbs, sesame seeds, and cheese full of flavor and texture. Our favorite is the Pasta alla Vodka. That is why we come to Brio. My heart skips a little beat when they put this dish down in front of me and shower it in finely grated parmesan cheese. The aroma of the vodka sauce is one I have not experiened in any other Italian restaurant. Can't quite put my finger on what makes that distinctive delicious Brio Vodka sauce so special. Maybe it's the garlic that's been shaved thin (with razor blades?), or the fresh basil that perfumes the sauce, or it's the star of the dish...the soft pillows of heaven...the delicate ricotta filled pasta purses that melt in your mouth and go oh so very well with the sauce. I swear someone else must be eating my dish because it goes too quick until you devour the last of the pasta and reach for the sourdough bread to sop up the rest of this amazing sauce...it would be a sin not to! This is all I want to write about Brio, because when you come there you must order the Pasta Alla Vodka :)",

AAAAAAAAAAAAAAWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWW YYYYYYYYYYYYYEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAHHHHHHHHHHHH!!!!!!!!!!!!!!  - BRIO Burger -  For 2.95 i was expecting one or two slider sized burgers. Nope they serve a FULL SIZED burger cut into quarters. The beef patty is pretty darn tasty but there's no condiments so after a few bites it could get pretty dull. Couple this with the salad from the Shrimptini or from the carpaccio and sauce it with the sauce from the shrimp and eggplant.   - Ravioli Caprese -  Not bad but no meat. The sauce ultimately makes the dish. Go early and they'll flood that plate with sweet tasty sauce, go late and there'll be a a few slabs of sauce on the plate.  - Chorizo Fonduta - The 'Meh' of the menu. The fondu is a bit salty and is very rich.  - Beef Carpaccio -  Thin strips of raw beef with a spring salad on top drizzled with some kind of mustard sauce with capers. WIN.   - Spicy Shrimp & Eggplant - Dont really like eggplant very much but OH MAN THAT SAUCE IS GOOD!!!  - Margherita Flatbread -  Very nice, Very tasty, Could use more basil but overall it's perfect as a starter  - Shrimptini -  Already peeled shrimp in a martini glass filled with tasty salad. Very refreshing and awesome as a starter or in between rich dishes like the shrimp and eggplant  - Sliced Steak Bruschetta -  All you taste is the cheese and the greens but still this brushetta is DAMN tasty!!",

As for my lovely brunch, they mix their early morning mimosas and bloody mary's real well.  They have like 3 different kinds of eggs benedicts.  My friends and I decided to order all of them to to try.  We had your normal canadian bacon, another one with shrimp and crab, and a very different one: chorizo and chicken.  All of them were so good.  You must try them all!  To top off our buffet of eggs benedicts, we shared the Rasberry creme stuffed French Toast.

I can't lie and say I was excited about going somewhere we could have gone in Cleveland, but it was a good meal anyways. The peach sangria was probably my favorite part of the meal!   The selected menu we got had a salad, chicken, salmon and pasta on it. The salad was typical and satisfying. The salmon was actually really good. The sauce on it was tart and creamy at the same time and the shoestring potatoes were such a nice unique touch. The roasted tomatoes underneath were so sweet and savory at the same time, too. Overall, it was a tasty dish!   I really just think I would have been more excited about this place if we weren't in Vegas and surrounded by other options that we don't get in Cleveland.

    "text": "I don't usually review a chain restaurant but this one is special.  Although it is located in a \"mall\", it offers great outdoor seating in a comfy environment.    Big plus, its meant for Vegas residents so its inexpensive.  They have a great tasting bar menu from M-F 3:30pm-6:30pm and M-Thurs 9:00pm till closing where all items are just 2.95.  Not just talking fries or chips either.  Great burger, sausage and pepperoni flat bread, beef carpaccio, spicy shrimp and eggplant, etc.    Don't make the mistake of ordering the entire menu like a buddy and I did.  First your server and bartender will laugh at you (noob), and second, no way you will finish it (wasteful noob).  Wines are very inexpensive.  Large by the glass selection and generous pours are the norm.  If its a cooler night, sit outside by a fire pit and make some friends.  Service is very friendly (its a locals place).  Family friendly.  Oh yeah, the regular menu for lunch and dinner is also very good and fairly priced but you cannot beat the bar menu for price.  Well worth it.",

    "text": "When I hit up Vegas I don't usually hit up restaurants.  I know some of you are probably thinking... Why not?  Don't they have tons of great restaurants out in the City of Gluttony?   True that... But!  Remember!  This is also home to endless scrumptious buffets as well!  How can I let that slide right?  Ok... so I ended up at a restaurant this time around... Buffets I'll see you on my next trip.  Stopped by this hidden shopping plaza near the South end of the strip... Yes!  There is one real nice shopping mall and it's not an outlet!  (Town Square)  This plaza is totally nice and especially during the winter time coz it's got such a cozy feel to it... since we were looking for food, we came, we searched, and we landed at Brio Tuscan Grille.  Initially I thought I wasn't going to like it, but I'm glad that I was wrong.  Let me tell you why this is definitely a place that I'd go back again...  Decor:  Awesome!  Interior design at this place rivals those at the Grand Lux cafe except much fancier!  Dim, beautiful lighting, and awesome outdoor patio with a fire pit for a nice little gathering should you have a large party.  Food was actually more tastier than I was expecting...  Here were just the few that I've sampled  -Calamari:  Flash fried to perfection with aioli dipping sauce, yum! -Penne Gorgonzola:   Off the hook good with just the right amount of sauce -Fettuccine Rustica:  Just ok... not enough sauce for my taste -Chipotle Chicken and Bacon Panini:  One of the best sandwiches I've had!  The bread was toasted beyond perfection to a point that it is crispy yet chewy!!! Not sure how that happened but I really need to try more paninis and see if they all taste this good!  Then the chipotle flavor coupled with load of chicken was just awesome!  (Yes, this was my dish!)  Service was wonderful too!  Water was always filled to the rim without requesting them to come by to do so, and they also allow dogs to be right by the gate so our buddies can share some food with us!  (not inside but at least near us)  Price:  Very reasonable!  Majority of the dishes for lunch runs no more than $15 and good portions too!  If you are in the Sin City and craving Italian, do help your wallet a favor by giving this place a visit instead of some fancy Italian joint inside the casino... you won't regret it!",

    "text": "A word of warning, this is not what most would consider authentic Italian, and I agree. It isn't. However, it's still tasty enough for me to enjoy and want to come back! Parking is a hassle since it's in the Town Center but just park in the lot about 3 blocks away and you're fine. Assuming you don't mind a bit of a walk in Vegas weather.  I had the Pasta Alla Vodka and it was tasty. It was ricotta filled with pieces of pancetta and a spicy tomato cream sauce. I do feel there could have been a bit more pancetta. The garlic was almost too absent to be considered a big contributor to the dish, which disappointed me because I'm a big garlic fan.   They have some really interesting cocktails which unfortunately i wasn't able to sample since we were driving back after lunch.   Decor is nice and dishes maybe be more than moderately priced. Came for lunch and it was about $16 plates.   But I'll def be back",

Brio is a must for anyone who has not tried it. You will not be dissapointed!",

The ambiance was perfect Sunday, even though we only had a lunch hour instead of the normal brunch experience.  Service was quick, and we had delicious bread and artisan crackers on our table before we could even order. The brunch food is awesome.  I had my heart set on the vegetable omelet with egg whites, mushrooms, etc. (I was sold with the mushrooms) and my darling wife had the Sicilian Omelet, with ham, bacon, sausage, etc. - and the star of the whole meal by far was the tomato compote on top of her omelet.  That sauce made us think of Italy, and made us want to come back to try some pasta here, because it was the most flavorful, full-bodied tomato sauce we've ever had. It totally took over the omelet, but in a darn good way. My white omelet was awesome, and I would get it again in a heartbeat.  But I'll try getting the tomato compote on it...  And maybe the brunch potatoes, which are also sublimely well done, not too crisp or soggy, not too salty or bland, just yum all around.",

It wasn't on the top, it was on the part that hangs off he table. I brought it to the attention of the waitress and she said that was disgusting. I also pointed out that the hair was greasy and she cleaned that up, but never bothered to do anything about the hair on the table. The plates on the table (for the bread) had so much water that when my friend put her bread on one of them, it got soggy. The food was good, but my experience upon being seated made me wonder about the hygiene in the preparation and service of my meal.",

I ordered the espresso ribeye steak with mashed potatoes and grilled asparagus. The steak was cooked perfectly and the seasoning was mild. It was Very good. I tried a few of my neighbors dishes, cod over angel hair with lemon caper sauce, and Brio pasta. They were all pretty good but I felt I made the BEST choice. Most of their dishes range in the $20-30. The sourdough bread is warm and crusty. delicious.",

A witness came to the table and just places the menus on the table. Her first words were hi how are you doing today? She didn't even listen to our responses because she immediately just walked away. Didn't offer water or give any eye contact what so ever. I and my guest look at each other and say umm nope let go. We are really up on customer service as we both work in the same field. I was really upset that it caused us to leave I was really looking forward to eating there and having a great experience. I've heard and seen many bad reviews about this place but I wanted to give it a try. Sadly I won't be going to that restaurant ever again.",

There's patio seating with mist for the hot Vegas weather although we chose the air condition inside.    Made our reservations on open table for a large party of 17 for my mom's birthday.   We were seated earlier than our reservation and Heather our server was very attentive from the moment we sat down.    Everything we ordered was amazing from the rib eye steak with a lobster tail on the side, shrimp risotto with a lobster tail, braised short rib, shrimp and lobster fettuccine.   The mac and cheese on the kids menu was not your normal kids Mac and cheese and actually tasted like pasta.  It was a portion for an adult or even three kids!     Now for dessert, order the caramel marscapone cheesecake.  We ordered the creme brulee, tiramisu, chocolate torte di chocolate but the cheesecake was my favorite.    It was my mom's birthday and they even gave her a birthday card.  Very nice touch to already great food and great service.",

She was like a hawk with our refills, orders and the bill.  The whole team there at Brio works so in sync with each other, so dynamic, it was a nice calm melody, how they worked as a team. Management must be great here.   Food was amazing  The pizza for our daughter was so good.  My wife got the Strawberry Balsamic Chicken Salad and that was amazing.  I got the Lobster Bisque that was out of this world and the Campanelle Carbonara that was finger licking good!  Thank you guys, for an awesome lunch!",

The sauce was silk smooth with good flavor a vodka sauce with stuffed ricotta. The three other meals were good and big servings. We sat outside since they have the misters. Inside has great A/C and ambience was inviting but a lot of people so a little loud. Plus tiramisu was great.",

    "text": "This branch of the upscale-casual eatery is in the Town Square Shopping Center, an open-air mall just south of the Welcome to Las Vegas Sign. It offers patio dining, which I love! and while all the hungry birds dropping by were a bit disconcerting, the misters made the triple-digit temps almost unnoticeable, and there is plenty of shade. On this Saturday, they were offering a brunch menu until 2pm with plenty of accompanying drink specials, in addition to the regular menu.  I had the Lobster Ravioli from the Starters menu, and paired with the Ensalata Della Casa (house salad) it was a full meal. And absolutely delicious- big chunks of lobster in a light pasta shell with a lemony butter sauce- heaven. The parmesan crisps on my salad were a nice and equally tasty addition to an otherwise slightly bitter serving of greens. I enjoyed a Sangria Rose from the bar. The price point is commensurate to the food and drink quality- my appetizer was $12, salad $8, and another $8 for my drink. This wasn't a 5-star experience (did I mention the birds?) as our friendly server made a few mistakes and it is, after all, a chain restaurant. But I did enjoy my visit and would not hesitate to return.",

Although the food was phenomenal, as it always has been, the service was a bit lacking today. I understood the lunch rush but where we were seated was at the very back of the restaurant and we felt like we were always forgotten. We came in the same time as other parties but we were the last ones to leave in our area. It took awhile for them to take our order and another wait for us to get our food. Because we were in a big group we were able to entertain ourselves.   I have to mention how great my dish was. I had the seared blackened ahi tuna with Yukon mashed potatoes and roasted veggies. There wasn't anything on that dish that I can complain about. My favorite was the roasted veggies. So simple yet so delicious. I can definitely eat a whole plate of those! Other dishes worth mentioning, chicken rigatoni, pan seared salmon, spaghetti pesto, and mushroom ravioli. Yum, yum, yum and yum!   We've been here a few times for birthdays and this is the first time the birthday celebrants didn't get desserts.",

The next morning woke <a href=\"/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2Fup.to&s=14a21e07edb3527944721f9a406eb0a391336aa11427638504bd10d5ea838438\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">up.to</a> a text from my CC company asking about a $4250 suspicious transaction from an Art school in Florida. Lol, and here I sit in Vegas. Needless to say they immediately reversed the charge.  I then called Brio to speak to a Manager and pass on my concerns. She immediately dismisses my concernes advising the CC number couldn't of been taken by her employee. Now I wasn't outright accusing her, just wanted to make the Management aware of potential fraud by their employee. I was told she would have the General Manager call me back to further discuss the incident. You guessed it, no call whatsoever.   I've been a victim of CC fraud in the past, thats why I'm cognizant of my actual card leaving my sight, and would NEVER use my debit card. Cash is king, but my fault for not stopping at the ATM and trusting a restaurant.   If you've experienced the same thing at this restaurant then you can empathize. Management handled my experience VERY poorly and that is a reflection of how they treat their guests.",

    "text": "When it comes to Italian fare, Las Vegas has both the chain restaurants and the local haunts to satisfy any need -- my previous reviews on Ferraro's Italian Restaurant, Ventano Italian Grill and Nora's Italian Cuisine speak to the quality of the local places. Do the chains have comparable quality, though? That was a question I ( unintentionally ) answered when I came to Brio at Town Square. Brio was one of my favorite restaurants back in the day, before I discovered other restaurants, and as I was in the area for a review class related to my work I found myself heading by afterwards to relive some of those memories.  As it was late in the evening when I came by -- around 8 PM -- I was seated very quickly as there wasn't many people in the restaurant, having largely avoided the dinner rush. I ordered the carpaccio, the chicken soup, the pollo caprese and the ricotta cheesecake -- all my favorite dishes from long ago.  Of these, the carpaccio and the chicken soup were still good -- the carpaccio was flavorful and meaty ( of course ), and the chicken soup was still as warm and comforting as I remember. However, when I had the pollo caprese I found that the chicken was somewhat overcooked, leading to a dry and crumbly texture that was off-putting to me. The pasta was also a bit too over cooked, too, being somewhat mushy and bland. And the cheesecake, while perfectly sweet, was a bit grainy and dry in the mouth.  The service itself was great, though -- the ambience was a welcome calm after the hectic atmosphere of my review class. However, that didn't make up for my disappointment in the food -- perhaps I've been spoiled by other Italian restaurants, but I found myself not as satisfied with Brio as I have been in the past. Perhaps I'll come by again if nostalgia dictates it, but for now the Brio I enjoyed will stay in the past...",

Our waiter was mediocre he just rarely stopped by our table to check on us for drink refills. I had the lasagna (it was fresh pasta) tasted lovely. My friend had the salmon (I tried a taste) unfortunately it was a bit dry. I really like the inside decor of the Colosseum that was pretty cool! But honestly I don't know if I'll go again? With so many choices of restaurants in Vegas, you'd think they'd be more on point with customer service.",

    "text": "This was our first time to any Brio Tuscan Grill, and I'm sorry to say, Diane and I left a little disappointed.  Lobster Bisque was smooth and tomatoey.  And, Cream of Mushroom Soup, the soup of the day, just contained bits of mushrooms.  We received only a small portion of Calamari Fritti, but at least the Calamari was very tender, and served with a little spicy but nice and smooth Arrabbiata Sauce.  Shrimp & Lobster Fettuccine was excellent and refreshing but Pasta Carbonara with Pancetta was fairly plain, and seemed to be missing something, like perhaps mushrooms. Service in the cavernous dining room was mixed: sometimes attentive, and sometimes not.  With as many fine Italian restaurants as there are in Las Vegas, under 4 stars just doesn't warrant a return, and I doubt we will be back.  ***-1/2 overall!",

    "text": "I came to Brio Tuscan Grille for lunch with a colleague Thursday mid-morning.   Brio Tuscan Grille has several locations through-out the Las Vegas valley, but we decided to meet up at the Brio Tuscan Grille in Townsquare. It's directly located off of Las Vegas Blvd and Sunset. You can also take the 15/215 to Las Vegas Blvd.  Brio is located in the middle of townsquare. We had arrived at 11:30  A.M and it was relatively empty. We had seating towards the back of the restaurant.  Our waitress was great! She immediately served our table with bread and offered drinks. My colleague had ordered a pasta dish and I had ordered the carbonara (entree). It took about 20 minutes for the order to come to the table, but our waitress had come by several times asking if we needed anything.  When the food arrived, my carbonara was cold. The sauce had congealed at the bottom of the dish. My colleagues food had arrived hot though. I was so hungry that I ended up eating it and not mentioning anything to the waitress since it was a lunch break and we really didn't have the time for food to re-cook in the back. My carbonara was also lacking seasoning, but that could have been because the food seemed like it had been sitting out awhile prior to being served.  The customer service at this Brio was good, but food quality was lacking. I'd give it another chance and order a different dish.",

Well, I saw this place was heavily reviewed by fellow Yelpster elites, but also saw a bunch of recent bad reviews so was a bit worried. Meh, Ef it I thought as I made a reservation for 3 at 7pm on a Thursday.   When we walked in, they sat us immediately after finding our reservation and although the hostess was smiling, the gal who sat us didn't really talk or smile so maybe she was just having a bad day. To say the restaurant is beautiful is an understatement as it could rival the shoppes at caesars palace.  A guy came over to serve us and was friendly and peppy. He took our drink orders which was a mix of the italian mule thing, iced tea, and just water. He then took our order of the chicken soup thing, lobster bisque, and calamari.   The calamari was good, not great, but good. The chicken soup tasted kinda average but with lemon. The lobster bisque was good but not amazing.   Then came the entrees, one friend got breaded chicken stuff, the other got the light pesto thing, and I got the bolognese spaghetti thing. I have NEVER ordered spaghetti at an italian restaurant before but was pleasantly surprised. The mix of fresh sauce, sausage, and beef was great. And although my friend didn't like his pesto, we ended up switching half way through and  after adding a little bit of marinara from the calamari it was fine, since yeah, it was a bit dry.   But would I go there again? Absolutely, was the service great? yeah pretty much. How about the food, well its a lot better than Olive Garden or any other italian chain for the same price which definitely warrants a whole 4 stars for the entire experience.",

Alas, this is my favorite restaurant in Town Square because of their steak salad! If it's not happy hour, I legit get that every time. It's my go-to! But today... my server said they changed the steak salad. I legit died, you guys. My heart sank! Guess he realized I wanted the old salad when I asked for extra cheese. To which, he explained the change. I asked how different it could really be? To which, he thought about and said: pick something else! Heck, thanks for being honest. Guess he loved the steak salad as much as I did \"(  Womp womp womp **play the sad and dying horn** This time around, ordered the shrimp Capri and lasagna lunch specials. Which came with soup or salads. Gosh, if I couldn't get what I wanted at least I would get a deal. **still butt hurt**  Brio always has something for everyone. At least if you like pasta, that is! To me, they never disappoint when it comes to the wide selection of Italian foods.   Not to forget one of the best happy hours in town! With delicious food choices on the HH. Do yourself a favor and get the shrimp eggplant, please!  It's, also, super kid friendly with the kids menu. That mind you, I've thought about ordering from!",

    "text": "We had a nice lunch after arriving on the first flight into Las Vegas from the Los Angeles area. We hit the outlets nearby first then made our way to Town Square to have an early lunch at Brio... I had heard many good things about Brio from friends that dine there regularly and the locations in the Phoenix area.   We were seated immediately as the restaurant had just opened for the day (11am on Fridays). We were placed in a spacious booth on the kitchen side of the restaurant. First impression of the place is amazement of how big and tall a space Brio has. It has high lofted ceilings in the main dining room, a bar area to the right and the big open kitchen space to the left. There are also outdoor patio seating areas and plenty of it for al fresco dining.   We were started off with a bread basket which was good. The bread was still warm and the thin cracker like triangle bread thins were tasty. My only issue was the butter provided was too hard and made spreading it and cutting into it an exercise in futility. It was a little frustrating especially being so hungry at the time.  I went with the pesto chicken club sandwich $13.95 (sans tomatoes) and it was good. The homemade chips the sandwiches come with are excellent. Nice and crunchy with a salt flavor. The club sammich itself was good. The chicken was tender and drizzled in a house made pesto sauce. The bacon was good and the bread held up for the most part.   Also ordered was a lunch combination half & half order of pasta brio and lobster bisque ($15.50) The pasta was good. Pasta Brio is essentially their version of chicken rigatoni so it comes with crimini mushrooms & chicken in a red pepper sauce. That topped with shredded cheese made for a great lunch.   Service was ok. Nothing special. It was early... Seemed like our server was just getting into the groove of the day. He wasnt bad. Just not super on it.   Brio was a good lunch. I would go again and try their signature flatbreads or pastas. Its a perfect place for lunch or dinner.",

Even the sourdough bread on the table was fresh and satisfying.  The best part of the meal?  The white peach sangria.  Wow!  Very refreshing and not overly sweet as some sangrias can be.

    "text": "This is the short version of the longest review ever written...  I got married in Vegas June 20, 2008 and chose Brio for the after ceremony (reception?) dinner. I planned my entire wedding over the course of 3 weeks remotely from Colorado, so I didn't realize Brio was in a mall. I'm sure I could have figured that out if I'd read more reviews...  I ended up loving Brio! When we first arrived, we were told that our private room was not available due to the air conditioning unit going out inside and the room temp hovering around 90 degrees. I think when something goes wrong with a major reservation, the way the staff treats the issue is a True sign of their customer service skillz. Well folks, the staff at this Brio location has mad skillz, the skillz that pay the billz even!! They apparently left me a voicemail letting me know of the issue earlier in the night, but for some crazy reason, could be that I was exchanging vows and bling with the love of my life, I didn't get the msg. So anyway, they were very apologetic and seemed almost let down themselves that I didn't have the perfect room for my dinner on my wedding day....it was really okay though because I was at a very zen place right then and they were so nice about it.   So, onto the meal. The staff had curtained off half of the regular dining area so we still had a private dinner, it was just a little louder around us than it would have been behind closed doors. Brio comped us two bottles of Champagne for our toast due to the room being unavailable and Chris, who was absolutely sweet and could not have been more attentive, waited on us hand and foot during our meal. He also provided sparkling orange juice for the kids and my sister in law who is expecting for the toast. The champagne was good, the bartender even came in and helped us pick out a few bottles of wine to drink with our meal which was nice. We all ordered right off the menu since there were only 14 of us. My son and I both had the Salmon which was served on parmesan crusted tomatoes and with shoestring potatoes, so delicious! My husband and step-son had the lamb chops and mashed potatoes - I don't like lamb but I tasted the mashers and they were seriously the best I've ever had. All in all, the food was scrumptious and prompt and the service was outstanding.   The day after the wedding, I had a message from the manager at Brio, Kenna, that someone in my wedding party left something at the restaurant and she needed my address to send it to me. I waited a few days to receive whatever it was that was left there after I got back to CO. To my surprise, a package arrived with a letter from Chris and the staff at Brio thanking me for choosing them for my reception dinner. Included was the cork from our champagne bottle, that day's newspaper and the table covers that we had written on in crayon while enjoying our meal. So thoughtful and cute, the staff at Brio going above and beyond made the experience of my Vegas wedding that much more enjoyable! Grazie!",

I find it hard giving anyone or anything a 5-star but this review isn't about the awe-inspiring story of how I overcame being so an*l. Well maybe it is.  If I could give this place a 4 and half star I would, simply because 5-stars is reserved for the best meal of my life and I believe that hasn't happened yet. However, since I can't and 4-star would be an injustice, this place gets a 5.  Brio is easily one of the best restaurants I've been too in the past couple of years (tied with Hanks and miles ahead of Napa Valley win train). The food is exceptional! The service is impeccable! The decor is tres chic (love the high ceilings) and the staff is attentive. If I had to make one negative comment it would be the unfortunate proximity to the airport. It gets REALLY loud when a plane flies overhead and I'm going to blame the high ceilings for the acoustic effect. Having said that, you're going to Brio for the food. You really can't go wrong with anything here but the Salmon is highly recommended.  Final word - Make reservations and give in to the food.",

I was panic-stricken as the last time I dined there, healthy fare options seemed scarce.  Was pleasantly surprised to find a phenomenal lunch special -- fish of the day. This day it was mahi mahi with spinach and other veggies. No need to do my \"no rice/no potato\" special order drama.  I asked for sauce on the side, no oil  and some lemon wedges.  Delicious! I even resisted the bread basket. My friend's steak salad looked fabulous and hearty as well.",

Our party gave the server a 28  percent tip and he did not even thank us.He just gave us a stupid smirk like he really deserved it.  What a douche bag!

    "text": "Oh Brio.  I try so hard to enjoy dining there because the food is amazing.  Keep in mind, I'm a bit biased because typically I frequent Brio during happy hour.  First, let's talk about Happy Hour. A plenitful variety of appetizers (including a full size burger) for $2.95.  Budget friendly?  That would be a yes.  I've also eaten at their sister company Bravos quite a few times, and everything I ever had off the menu was AMAZING.    But good food only gets you so far with me.  What's an instant ratings killer?  Oh right, Bad service.   Now granted, I eat at Brio quite a bit because it happens to be located near my place of employment, so because of that I tend to frequent their Happy Hour specials on my lunch hour.  Just the food portion though.  Drinking during my lunch would be a little more than frowned upon.    So I'm not sure if it's because I typically dine alone, or they know I work in the vicinity of the restaurant, or it's because I never consume alcoholic beverage in the bar area when I'm on my lunch, but the service has gone from decent to mediocre to abysmal.  My review is based on my previous visit.  So I'm sitting at the bar during happy hour and it's actually quite a slow day, meaning lots of empty bar stools.  I come in, sit down, and no exactly what I want.  The gentleman beside me gets his food right as I'm sitting down and apparently knows the one of the many...I think at one point I counted 5 people working behind the bar.....bartenders.  She inquires about his food, glances at me....and WALKS AWAY.  Ok, maybe she was distracted.  5 minutes later- no one has even acknowledged my presence, let alone taken my order.  So I sit patiently wondering what the deal is when one of the bartenders notices I haven't been waited on and asks how she can help me.  Afraid that no one is going to come in my direction again, I place my food and drink order all once.  Meanwhile, the guy to my left is displeased with one of his dishes and gets it removed from his bill.  So my food comes, it's tasty as always, but water at this point is empty.  After being finished with my food for well over 5 minutes, the bartender from before comes over...glances right at my empty water glass... and asks if I'm ready for the check.    So let's briefly discuss the number one way to piss me off at a restaurant- oh that's right, an empty drink.  So at this point, I pay my tab and bolt.  And haven't been back since.",

The plate with my food was good looking to my palate but it tasted so bland.  I had the prosciutto and fontina cheese stuffed chicken breast with mashed potatoes.  The  prosciutto was not good and it actually felt like I was eating onions. I don't like onions.  I never did see the cheese or taste it.  The chicken has a bit of fat on it.  The mashed potatoes got cold very quickly as the air conditioning in the restaurant blew in our faces. My husband ordered a pasta dish with lots of shell fish.  He didn't like his either.

I had been looking forward to trying Brio for a long time as I'm frequently in Town Square.  When we first entered, I really liked the decor! It was very majestic and beautiful - kind of reminded me of Caesar's Palace! We immediately ordered drinks. My best friend decided to order a Bloody Mary while I went with my favorite extra dirty martini. Both cocktails were disappointing.  Our server then brought out several baskets of warm bread which was delicious and probably one of my favorite parts of the meal! Our group ordered several appetizers to share - the calamari and the spicy shrimp & eggplant. Both dishes were excellent.  Since my cocktail was unenjoyable, I decided to play it safe and order a glass of wine to complement my meal. I knew that I was going to go with seafood so I went with the Sauvignon Blanc from Italy which was an excellent choice! It was a very crisp and refreshing wine. For the main course, I went with the Pesce Piccata (wild caught cod), which unfortunately lacked flavor, was rather dry, & overall disappointing. The angel hair pasta that came with it also tasted somewhat undercooked. My best friend ordered the evening's special - sea bass - which was delicious! Finally, we ordered a few desserts that we all shared at the table. I had the creme brulee and it was fantastic! Overall, my favorite parts of the meal were the bread, appetizers, desserts, and overall ambiance. The service was very good too and our server was polite and knowledgeable.  I plan on returning to try other items and specifically to try their happy hour!",

Our waitress had to be hunted down by another waiter. During her first visit to our table we ordered drinks and our meals.   The people that came in after us, and were  seated after us got there food 20 minutes before us. The waitress finally came by and joked about how long it was taking, yet offered no apologies.   Now, I understand that it's a Sunday, and Valentine's Day, however a little more organization and consistency would have been nice.  This will be the last time I visit this restaurant due to the horrible experience. I do not recommend it to anyone anymore.  UPDATE: Someone from Brio replied to my review that they would message me. 6 days later, I'm still waiting for a message. They must be on the same schedule as the restaurant was that day.",

The food is excellent - not on the inexpensive side, but definitely worth the money for such good quality and taste.  I'm particularly fond of the Mezza Chicken Limone and end up getting that almost every time we go, although I've had the chopped salad as well and it's great.  I like that the menu flags a number of items that are under 595 calories so if you are counting them at all or just want to know what might be a healthier choice - they make it really easy.  Love the outside seating (and there is plenty of it) - especially if we're trying to get some work done...the inside can get a little bit noisy.  Service is excellent...beyond reproach, in fact.  Definitely the place you want to go to for a business lunch.",

Maybe they don't want people camping out but that's zero excuse. How can anyone tag their social media or write a Yelp...? Maybe this place will always have business & they don't care but quality patrons should come first. This is the exact thing that happened to Kona Grill. Kona rested on its happy hour to bring the cool, hip crowd. Then they let their standands go, no upgrades. The losers and hangers-on infiltrated the restaurant because quality patrons want quality and went elsewhere. Then the whole restaurant went to crap... There used to be a cool, hipster crowd at Brio but now they only come to enjoy the patio when it's convenient. The menu is awful. How can in 2017 you not have Vegan options? Really? It shows that Brio could care less about anything forward thinking. Check out the photo of my pathetic chopped salad. It's embarrassing.",

When we got there, we were seated immediately and was presented with the most sweetest waitress ever. I'm so disappointed that I forgot her name!  I am a huge fan of Marsala sauce so I went with the Grilled Chicken \"Under the Brick.\" I requested extra sauce and I was not disappointed. Even my daughter of 6 enjoyed it and you know how it goes when it comes to children. As for my other half, he got the Chicken Milanese. He's a simple kind of guy and way pickier than our daughter, but he cleared his plate with \"Wow\" in between bites. Let's just say it's now Pomodoro over Marinara any day.  I also love the fact that this restaurant is in the heart of Town Square, my favorite place to shop. And shall I mention the interior? It's so beautiful! Definitely bringing another crowd to this place again.",

I don't know the names of the two breads they put on the table, but they were really good!   I spent approximately $60 for two people, during lunch.

The decorations all around were beautiful, and the high ceilings with the curtains really caught my eye.   Our server, Cortney, did an amazing job coursing out our food and handled all of our requests.  We had calamari and the shrimp & eggplant for appetizers. The runner who brought them out even said they were the two best things on the menu for appetizers, and he was right! The shrimp and eggplant had a peppercorn sauce and grated cheese. SO DELICIOUS. And the calamari had fried peppers in it and came with two sauces, one that was tomato based and the other mayonnaise. For entrees, my boyfriend had crab stuffed shrimp and lobster tail. He didn't care for the orzo and broccoli on the side, but I found it delightful! It also came with lobster bisque!!! And I love lobster bisque. I had the chicken limone. Delicious was an understatement. It was seasoned perfectly & nice and tender. I am so sad that I was too full from the apps to finish it, but at the same time, i can't wait to warm it up later  Cortney boxed up our calamari and my chicken and even gave us to go sauce for the calamari. Her kind smile and great service really made our first time experience a great one!   Overall, from the low prices, big entrees, cute decor, and amazing service, we will definitely come back!",

They've also opened some of their windows so the nice breeze circulated throughout the place.  My friends and I went in for lunch. I ordered the Mezza Chicken Under the Brick, while my friends ordered an omelet and a risotto lunch special with salad. The breads for the table were delicious! My favorite was the crispy one with sesame seeds. I wish the butter was softer and more spreadable.  The Mezza Chicken, listed under 500 calories, was a good lunch-sized portion. The chicken was delicious and absorbed the mushroom flavored gravy it was topped with; but the vegetables were my favorite. They were seasoned very well and I loved the slight char on all of them. The mashed potatoes were light and provided a great contrast to the vegetables and chicken.  Our server was great and friendly. There was a mistake on our order, where we were charged an extra $5 for a salad that was included in the lunch special. When we pointed it out, she apologized and remedied it. I would definitely come here again, and I hope the location near home will be as beautiful as this one.",

    "text": "We had reservations 6 last night, and, based on my experience at the Park Meadows/Colorado location, I was very excited to partake in some yummy Italian food. We were seated promptly by a friendly hostess, but that's where any semblance of good service ended. The waiter completely forgot to bring bread and butter and was very difficult to catch when we tried to ask for some.   Our starters came quickly. Our entrees also came quickly. So quickly, in fact, that there was no room on the table for any of them, and we were left scrambling to finish our salads while the busboy wedged in main courses.   I ordered shrimp and lobster ravioli, which I've had previously at the Colorado location. Apparently this one doesn't serve it, so the waiter changed my order to fettuccine and neglected to tell me. I did not want fettuccine. The busboy kept trying to give me the plate I hadn't ordered until, a good 5 minutes later, the waiter showed up and allowed me to order something new. By this point, I was stressed out that the rest of the party would be finished by the time that my meal came out. From what I remember, the roast chicken was good, but since I was trying to inhale it, not much made an impression.  Last but not least, my friend and I ordered the same dessert - creme brulee. My dish clearly hadn't been cleaned properly before the new brulee was made, since it had rubbery, burnt on bits at the bottom on the ramekin. That, however, paled in comparison to my friend.  She found several different kinds of paper inside her dessert - what looked like a sizeable piece of paper towel and tissue. Like the rest of the night, the waiter never came by to check in, so the issue was never resolved.  Ew.",

The bruschetta is the best! Assorted toppings with different flavors, highly recommended. For dinner we share the Bistecca Alla Fiolentina a 14 oz strip steak which was very tender, juicy, and mouthwatering. it was paired with mash potatoes and grilled vegetables. Overall, I gave Brio a 4 star because of the server, she told us the appetizers came in small servings. So, ordered 3 and it filled us for the dinner. Plus, the sangria was sour and watered down.",

    "text": "I came here for Happy Hour with my girl friends for their tasty appetizers and drinks. Happy hour is served only at the bar though, so it was a bit cold when we had to sit outside during the winter. Luckily they provided heat lamps and had curtained off the outside area.  My favorite appetizer is the black pepper shrimp with parmesan eggplant, it has a very flavorful sauce. I used the complimentary crusty bread to sop up all that deliciousness. The crispy eggplant fries are served with a fantastic creamy horseradish sauce is very tasty and the beef carpaccio with capers and topped with mustard aoli and shaved parmesan cheese was also very good.   The tomato margherita flat bread is simple and straightforward, nothing special. The Brio burger is decent and was sliced in fours to share. The roasted garlic, spinach & artichoke dip is served with parmesan flatbread was also good. And of course you have to wash down all those appetizers with a dirty martini or two. They have pretty good happy hour items and prices and I always have a good time here.",

My husband ordered the Gorgonzola meat tenders and of course I tried it with mash potatoes and veggies. Everything was delicious.  The waiter wasn't as amazing as the place and the food - but overall it was a great place in Town Square.  When we return to Vegas, I'm sure to come back.   PS they have outside seating with misters!

I would of given it a five but place was pretty packed and seating is limited cause they closed the patio area due to it being a bit cold outside. Went here with my mom and brother . We ordered 5 drinks and 4 appetizers which totaled about $56. Not too bad. The appetizers were really really tasty and the portions were decent. Service was pretty good as well ESP for it being happy hour. I would def check this place out again for another happy hour and maybe even dinner .",

All was pretty tasty and nothing spectacular.   The reason I gave it 2 stars was because the wait staff seemed slammed even though it was like 3 in the afternoon. The other reason was that the lobster bisque came in a bowl but was only filled halfway. I asked why was it filled halfway? The answer given to me was since all food was hand/tray carried they only filled soup halfway. The problem with that is from the customer's perspective; it just feels like they are shorting you. Most if not all restaurants carry their food out on trays and my soup is always filled to satisfaction but not here.",

I feel like it is better when you sit at table rather than the bar. I prefer to come here during happy hour (3:30 to 6:30 pm) because the prices are more reasonable. They also have a late happy hour which I believe starts at 9 or 9:30pm. They have the most delicious shrimp and eggplant dish that is available for happy hour.  It is called the SPICY SHRIMP & EGGPLANT Pan seared shrimp, Romano crusted eggplant, black pepper cream sauce for $12.75 regular and half off for happy hour. I also love their Imported Bottled Peach Tea peach tea. SAN BENEDETTO for $3.25 each. They also have a nice kids menu with activities and crayons to keep them busy when I bring my 8 and 5 year old. They loved the food and feel like we are going to a fancy place because everything is so clean and nice. Town square has a lot to offer so if you drink here you can head to Blue Martini afterwards to dance.",

I cant pick one plate to rave about because all the apps are great (especially the Bruchetta sampler) and the brunch menu has several great options, depending on what your in the mood for.   All the staff is very attentive and the manager is always walking around checking on everyone. There is usually a wait for a table, so come prepared but its definitely worth it.   We will keep coming back for the Yummy food, Great drinks & Jade!",

I'm from Las Vegas - and there isn't a single time where I think I NEED to go to a restaurant.  Since leaving this place, I have been to restaurants that I never knew could exist - restaurants where you can hang out in a trendy restaurant, eat phenomenal food and not spend more than $30/person? What?!  I don't know what it is about Vegas. Maybe it's the fact that Vegas values the bright lights, brand names, glitz and glamour before anything else.   Anyway, a group of us (10 + 1 baby) needed a restaurant that can hold us, have great food, reasonably priced, trendy, and away from the strip.  My friends even though they've lived here all their lives can't even give me any suggestions (I'm flabbergasted). Where I live (Phoenix), I can give you my top 10 and then some. So I decided to on Brio and I've eaten at this restaurant before in Phoenix and was not impressed. Restaurant reminds me that of a Cheesecake factory, chain restaurant.    They did seat us right away, which was nice. The bread came out and the group was having a fun time.  We are loud as ever and the noise level of the restaurant was loud so we didn't feel like we were bothering anyone with our obnoxious rants an laughs so that was good.  I ordered the gluten free grilled salmon with lemon and caper sauce. The flavor was ok. Nothing to rave about.  I wish I had better options to fit what I was looking for in my dining experience. At the end of the night, it wasn't the flavor of the food that made the night a \"good\" night.  It was the fact that a group of 11 was able to get together, talk and laugh as loud as we want, not cringe at the bill, and still be happy and full.",

    "text": "If this review was solely based on the happy hour it would be a solid 5 star . So if your like me and you hunt for the best happy hours out there this is definitely one of the best ! They have huge portions and the food deals are $4,$5 & $6 .   I like the beef carpaccio $4, black pepper shrimp $6, caprese salad $5 and the eggplant fries $4. They also have good deals for the drinks . But keep in mind that happy hour is available only in the bar area ! It's from 3:30-6:30 Monday - Friday .   I've eaten here non happy hour a few times , and it was okay , it's a totally different experience in my opinion. I had the risotto and it was okay portions were good but it did not wow me .   The main area is really pretty and they have outdoor seating as well so you can people watch if that's your thing . For hot days , they also have mists to keep their patrons cool on their patio.   I love you brio !",

    "text": "I was initially let down that there was too long of a wait for the patio as it was a gorgeous day outside..nothing their white peach sangria couldn't fix! I'm normally a red wine kinda gal, but seeing as this was recommended by both my boyfriend and the server I decided to give it a try. It was good until (almost) the last drop...last few sips tasted like straight soda.       On to the food. I have had quite a few beef carpaccios in my day but none come even CLOSE to comparing to the one they have at Brio. It was about half the size of me, unbelievably fresh and drizzled in what tasted like a garlic aioli. Mind. Blown. The Caprese salad was pretty tasty as well but needed a bit more balsamic glaze; I was too emanored by the carpaccio to remember to ask for more hehe. We also had the bruschetta quattro, Pasta Brio and the special bruschetta, which was a spicy shrimp with lobster butter. I, being allergic to shellfish, could not have the special bruschetta, hence why we ordered this way.      I deducted a star because the shrimp bruschetta was on the serving plate with the other assorted bruschettas. My allergy is not deathly so I simply avoided the pieces on either side of the shrimp, but as a server they should be a little more careful when a guest states they have an allergy. Hives aren't exactly my idea of a \"fun\" Friday night.      On a side note: The Pasta Brio tastes just as good cold as it does fresh out of the kitchen.",

Our party sampled several dishes: Pasta Brio - very good and perfectly al dente Lasagna - solid but not phenomenal.  Huge portion. Bread basket - delicious rustic loaf and crackers Steak carpaccio - excellent.  Must try!  The sauce and salad that accompany it are great. Florentine steak - juicy with a crisp seared exterior.  Excellent! Shrimp Mediterranean - here's where the experience fell short.  The shrimp was ok and had a lot of kick.  The orzo and farro that came with it was extremely oversalted.  It's as if they put a canister of salt into the cooking water. Dessert trio- very good.  The cheesecake was my favorite. I'd definitely come back.  Just skip the Shrimp Mediterranean.",

I would suggest not promoting him to server until he gets the bread right. The place is noisy so don't expect a nice quiet dinner for two. Mom said the crabcakes were lukewarm at best. With so many waiters and cooks bumping into each other, why would food come out of the kitchen cold? Go figure. We'll return, but we won't be in a big hurry. Las Vegas has many choices, and at Town Square, many are within walking distance.",

    "text": "Now all of you reviewers need to tell me what you did for service?  Regardless if happy hour is discounted pricing, you all understand that's probably one of their busiest times of day.  Considering its the time of day people are getting out of work, if you hand a menu to someone and disappear for 30 minutes it's hard to sit still.   We came in at the beginning of happy hour! Seated ourselves near the little booths by the bar. It took 13 minutes just for a menu. NOT COOL.luckily my boyfriend and I have some amazing conversations or else I don't know how else to let the time pass.   We eventually got our menus l, took a look. In a matter of minutes, especially after waiting so long for a menu, we finally are ready to give her the rundown on everything we want.   We keep seeing the same server rush back and forth so we keep waiting. After we see her and have her tell us she's about ready to take our drink order, she looks over and sees a party of 20 rush outside.  Where do you think our server went?!  Never got to put that drink order in :(  All we wanted was a nice happy hour! After all, grandma had the little one all day so we might as well take advantage.   After being so patient to try out this elegant restaurant, we thought maybe yard house was a better choice. They know us there so there's never waiting for a drink!   Maybe we gotta be dressed lookin like a million bucks, or go with a fat group!  I wanna try it again, my man was just really tryin to get that happy hour on so it might take a little convincing.",

The steak and cheese complemented each other quite nicely if I may add.   I ordered the chicken piccata which I felt like you could never go wrong with. It was mediocre. There wasn't flavor that really stood out for me. The salmon has a good amount of seasoning on it which enhanced the flavor of the fish.   Last but not least, the dessert menu! The caramel mascarpone cheesecake won me over! It was simply to die for!   I can honestly say that Brio did not disappoint! Kudos!",

    "text": "Brio is an Italian Restaurant located in the middle of Town Square on the South Strip.The parking area is a short walk away. It is a large layout containing an inside and outside sit-down bar, plus numerous tables, sofas, fire-places circled by comfortable seating that offer cozy atmospheres. The kitchen is not visible to patrons and there are no emanating smells. The ventilation is efficient and keeps the air fresh. The uniformed staff is friendly and gives a warm welcome upon arrival. We are immediately seated and attended to.  Music is also performed by a small live band in the evenings. The volume is high and on the distractive side . The dish I ordered was a beef carpaccio. It is served in a sizable platter that surprised me. It is not an immense amount of food. The center is thin and crunchy Italian bread that resembles pizza, but it is not. This is laid on top of a small salad. The outer edge of the platter has the thin slices of carpaccio that is lightly covered with mustard aioli, Parmigian and capers. The aroma is of a strong and spicy vinegar with no notice of the raw meat. The taste of the meat is mild, but all the other condiments make the meal salty and acidic. The capers give it lively chewy taste. The texture of the meat is very tender and it melts in your mouth, while the crunchy bread is seedy and rough. The ingredients complement each other very well. To top it off the dessert was hot chocolate cake with ice cream on top along with vanilla on the perimeter. There was also chocolate syrup and raspberry on the side.  It had a strong flavor of chocolate and vanilla combined. Hot and cold ,sweet and bitter makes a great taste. The wait staff was friendly however to a fault, as they checked on our needs too often. Their timing was about every 5 minutes and it interrupted our dining. The overall experience was a plus, I would repeat.",

The ambiance of the restaurant is relaxed and quiet and put together very well. Their outside eating area is huge and borders the restaurant along a couple of walkways for pedestrians. It's a really nice place to relax and enjoy your meal.  I've had quite a few dishes here. The lasagna is great as is the lobster bisque. I've never had a problem with quality or taste here. They also have a great wine selection to pair with your meal.  They're service has always been on par and friendly. This is a great place to have business meetings or to take business persons you want to have an intimate and business-friendly meal with.  The restaurant can get quite busy during the holidays so make sure you have a reservation in place before you head here.",

    "text": "Was at Brio Tuscan Grille tonight.  We had a reservation for three  and was given a big round table for six.  We asked for a smaller table and was told we had to request a smaller table.  I was a little perturbed.   Waitress came over and gave us menus.  When she came to take order we had to ask for specials menu.  We asked for special oil and vinegar dip for our bread and was brought a bottle of oil and vinegar.  Not what we asked for!!!  We ordered and food came and my meal Pasta Brio was ice cold.  Asked for manager and she told us it would be taken care of.  My friend ordered a side of linguini in lemon butter to go with her lamb chops and they brought her a bowl of lemon butter without the pasta. LOL?  What was she going to do with the lemon butter?  My pasta came back hot and my friend finally got some linguini to go wth her lemon butter.  When the bill came there was nothing taken off for the inconvenience of wrong service and the bill was quite confusing as they charged twice for items.  There was no offer of any dessert or any attempt to compensate us for bad service.  To make matters worse the men's bathroom door was wide open near our table and we had to ask someone to close it so we did not get this special view.  I told manager that I was a local with lots of choices to eat and will never go back.  I never will.  Thanks for a memorable Memorial Day dinner.",

    "text": "I have been to Brio a few times prior to this and each time has been nothing special so I never thought to write of those experiences. On Monday a friend of mine and I decided to eat here after some shopping. There was no wait and we had the pleasure of being seated in Amanda's section who was an absolute delight!! I could not have asked for a better server or better service! She was extremely knowledgeable of the menu, engaged in some wonderful conversation and even joked with us when appropriate.   We started with the amazing Bruschetta Sampler which Amanda recommended, perfect choice! My friend went with some sort of pasta and I chose the lamb chops with Maple Balsamic Brussels Sprouts.   After the food was delivered, Amanda checked up on us to ensure everything was great. I actually finally was able to convince my friend to try lamb for the first time. She actually loved it  and we expressed that to Amanda. After a couple of minutes Will, some sort of manager came over and asked if everything was ok, we confirmed that it was and he continued on his way. After I finished the first lamb chop, I took a break to show my friend something on my phone when we were rudely interrupted by Will, the manager. He immediately asked if we wanted boxes. We hadn't even had our main dish for longer than 10 minutes and I told him that I was not finished and I was still working on it. He then said he would go get the check, he returned a few minutes later and said \"No rush!\"  I was kind of confused because there wasn't a wait for seats and there were several tables that had been at their enjoying their dinner longer than we were even in the restaurant.   Amanda came over and even was confused on why he was bothering us, we explained that we felt that we were being kicked out and were not even offered the dessert menu which we were actually going to order, but since we were made to feel unwelcome we would just pay and leave. Amanda decided to get another manager to come over and apologize for the experience. Jenna came over and apologized and offered free dessert but our experience was already ruined and since we were made to feel like we were not wanted we just wanted to leave.   We paid the tab and decided to leave. Again I cannot tell you how amazing Amanda was, Jenna was very sympathetic and tried everything change our experience.   Honestly, Will should not be allowed to work with the public. I do understand why we were basically told to leave before I was able to even taste my side dish.  I definitely will not be back at this location!  I forgot to mention that after this was posted, I did receive gift card in the mail as a way to make peace, but also a personal phone call from Will informing me that he was bothered that someone would feel this was about him, he apologized profusely and even offered to buy me drinks, i kind of feel weird that they gave him my number and he kept me on the phone for a good 30-45 minutes trying to win my approval. It was strangely uncomfortable but at the same time nice to be able to tell someone they were the reason for a low review, just weird he has my cell phone number.",

    "text": "Brio, where have you been all my life?! I was down at Town Square on Saturday, 4/16/11 because my sister had to meet with one of the directors for a project she was working on and I didn't feel like sitting through the meeting. I wasn't going to get home till way past midnight so I needed to grab some food. I wanted to check out Brio, but assumed it would be super expensive and I felt silly spending $40 to eat by myself. I headed on over to CPK but it was overpriced and I wasn't in love with anything I saw on the menu. Despite my reservations, I checked out Brio and Wow! They're actually cheaper than CPK!  I went inside and was told it would be 10-20 minutes for a table for one. I was mid-heel turn when the hostess told me I could eat at the bar. The weather was gorgeous and the bartender was very friendly. I ordered the chopped salad and lobster bisque ($1 up charge) deal. The bread basket is amazing with the best crispy flat breads and sourdough I've ever had. My total, with tax and tip came out to $11, which isn't bad whatsoever. When my sister showed up, the waitress told me the Dr. Pepper was on her that I ordered for my sister, which was nice of her. Forget the Strip, my sister and I agreed that this would be our go to restaurant from now on.   Because I enjoyed my first visit so much, two days later, 4/18/11, after hitting up the 51's game, Beau S. and I headed over here for some after the game drinks. We walked right in to a fairly empty restaurant. We went to the bar and were told it was happy hour. I got beef carpaccio and he got the steak bruschetta and they were each $2.95. It was a great deal and I loved all the capers that came with my carpaccio. I got a soda water and Beau got some sort of beer. We also split a caffe panna cotta that was out of this world. The total, with tip was $15. Really great deal.   Obviously, I'll be back for a third time!",

After much deliberation, my friends wanted to dine here and I hesitantly agreed and I am actually quite glad that I did agree.   The restaurant definitely did something different this time. Their pasta was flavorful and tasted great. I ordered the lobster bisque again and it was quite tasty. The service was on point and their bread was delicious.  So the experience definitely changed and the food just tasted better and was cooked very well. I am still a little skeptical to go back because of the previous bad experience but If it came down to it I might just go again.   Kudos to Management as well, as they sent me a well thought out and professional e-mail about my bad experience.",

    "text": "When we first walked in, I wasn't sure if Brio would only be all decoration and average tasting food, which is what many restaurants seem to be these days.   My husband and 7-year old daughter were out shopping at Town Square, and wanted to grab some lunch.  We stumbled upon Brio and weren't sure if we were dressed properly (underdressed) but were treated as if we were first-class diners from start to finish.   To cut to the chase, from the moment we walked in until the second we left we were treated with the best customer service we've experienced in a restaurant in ages.  Our server (Tammy) was superbly kind, helpful, expedient and professional.  Our drinks came out in a flash, as did everything else.  The food was absolutely D-I-V-I-N-E.  We had the house margaritas (delish!), the chopped  salad (amazing), the Lobster Bisque (to die for!) and for our entrees, the petite filet \"Tournedos di Manzo\" the \"Mushroom Ravioli al Forno\", and for our daughter, the kids' lasagne.  My daughter especially liked the kids' fruit smoothie (by far the best smoothie, I've ever tasted), but wasn't too crazy about the lasagne.  I think it was due to the Italian sausage in it... she's not too crazy about Italian sausage.  What stuck out: the beautiful decor, the very friendly and very attentive serving staff, the \"dough-ball\" given to us to play with while we waited (which, we were told, could be baked before we left) and the extremely unique and tasteful food. All-in-all, a wonderful dining experience, and we will absolutely return!",

My husband and I had a date night (which is a rare occasion, because we have a 17-month old son) and we came to Brio with only 45 min before our movie started.  We knew we loved the food, but would we be able to get what we wanted and get to the movie in 45 min?  We had our doubts--but Jarrett made it happen.  To make things even more difficult for him, we ordered everything :)  Appetizers, alcohol, salads, main courses AND dessert to go!!  He gave us amazing service, and the food was fantastic!  We were out the door in 40 min--can you believe it? at a sit-down, upscale restaurant??  Awesome!!  I had the artichoke-crusted beef with mashed potatoes, a bistecca salad and we split a sampler of bruschetta.  My husband also had a salad and he ordered lasagna.  Everything was yummo and the service was impecable!  Ask for Jarrett next time you go there!",

I am writing this review with a smile on my face because if you have ever tried Brio... you know why. First and foremost, the restaurant is beautifully constructed inside and out. HUGE outside patio with fireplaces and inside you'll find a very open area with high ceilings, flat screens, large booths, and busy friendly servers. I ordered the mushroom stuffed ravioli with brown butter (holy mother.. absolutely to die for!!!) appetizer, lobster bisque (creamy.. just the right consistency and flavor with lobster pieces on top served in a cute white porcelain bowl) and the Sausage Gnocchi (perfect with red bell peppers, browned red onions in creamy red bell pepper sauce.. just a hint of spice). I cannot believe there isn't a Brio here in So Cal!!! The menu is very simple: brunch, soups, salads, pizza, pasta, and bruschetta (perfect portions). I am so sure whatever you go with, you will not be disappointed. I plan on taking everyone I love, here for a scrumptious toothsome Italian meal! BEL CIBO!!!",

When the risotto came , I thought, \"what a big bowl with such a small portion,\" but it was actually just enough to fill me.  My husband ordered the soup of the day which was the tomato bisque which he really liked.  For his entree, he ordered the linguine with baby clams and was happy with his choice.  The waiter brought over these mini desserts that looked so irresistible, we decided to order one Tiramisu and one Panna Cotta.  It was so good!

We had a large group (11) and were seated before our reservation which was nice but our table wasn't completely set up.  Not a big deal but when we all finally got seated they forgot to keep setting up the table, leaving some of us without place settings and me without a water for the first half of the meal which really annoyed me even though I asked 3 times.  It was super busy and the appetizers were delicious, so I forgave them.  I decided to go with a healthy option, the Shrimp Mediterranean because I wanted to be light plus I've never tried farro before.  It was quite good but since it was the healthy option, I was done super quick because there was so little.  I was not going to order dessert but when I came back from the bathroom the table had ordered for me and I was glad they did because the special caramel dessert cookie thing was amazing!  Food and atmosphere was on point, it was too loud though, and because of how busy it was, the service was lacking a little bit.

We normally go here once or twice a month before Valentine's incident.  Service here has changed from what it was years ago.  It's always a hit or miss.  We tend to spend about an hour to an hour and a half here, depending on how the service is and how busy they are.   We came on last Wednesday night with the same couple we went on Valentine's Day.  I didn't tell them we were invited back.  We all weren't too hungry this time around and only ordered 3 glasses of wine and an entree each.  I did have a gnat in my glass of wine.  They replaced it right away.  Service was much better this time from the hostess to our server.  I added one of my friend to the dinner and asked the hostess to tell our server to hand me the check at the end, so I can pay for the bill and tip properly on what was being taken care of.  We didn't order so much food and drinks, maybe this is why they took care of our visit.  I really do appreciate the kind gesture from the management.  After being a loyal customer of Brio since 2010...  Either this location have to get better in customer service or we'll have to suffer through the service.  LOL",

Must try the Grilled Salmon Fresca* (LT) Grilled asparagus, sweet potatoes, spinach, red peppers, pesto vinaigrette, Feta, tomatoes, and balsamic. Last but not least - the Warm Chocolate Cake with Vanilla with bean gelato.",

I'm actually not quite sure the exact time of their HH lol I think it's from 4-6? Or 5-7? Somewhere around there. Anyway, upon arrival, you seat yourself by the tables at the bar or just at the bar.   There were 4 of us at the table and I'm pretty sure we ordered everything off of the HH menu. There wasn't a lot to choose from but a good variety! So I'm not a big fan of burgers but the burger they had was actually really good - I was very impressed. I think my favorite though was the shrimp & eggplant dish! Really rich & creamy & just super yummy. I don't think there was anything that I didn't actually like, which is surprising lol. I also had one of their sangrias - I believe the white one. The drink was delicious, not too strong.   The lady who was serving us was really nice, but I think she was the only one back there. She came to our table maybe once or twice after our initial order & there was a good amount of people there. I would suggest staffing more people back there for HH so they're not so stressed. But will definitely be back!",

Brio town square is my favorite location than the rampart one. half bar is inside the building half is \"outside\". i Love their bar seating area where they offer a very nice Happy Hour deal from 3pm to 6:30pm monday to friday at the bar area only (at the bar or the 4 high tables by the bar or the couch facing the bar) Love their sangria, white peach or red sangria. Robert handles the bar with his team and he is just Excellent at remembering what you like to drink! Is that bad when he sees you and already prepare your drink without asking??  They are so so busy at the bar, no matter what you always get a smile!  Happy hour time I to order their beef carpaccio, captees salad, artichoke dips, sliders The lobster bisque and the steak salad are to die for! The main restaurant is very elegant and cosy! I love the decoration. To avoid the wait, you can always book your table :) Staff is friendly. Good address in town for good food and great service!",

I didn't, or at least believed I didn't, hear back from them after that.   I was about to come on here and lower the rating to 1 star due to what I thought was a fake apology on yelp with no follow through. Wanting to do my due diligence though, I checked my voicemails, and found a message from the GM apologizing and inviting me to speak with him. (I guess I should be reviewing Sprint's service for the missed call instead, haha) we haven't spoken yet, but I can see that they truly are trying to make the situation better.   As I said before, this had been an isolated event for us at Brio, and possibly on Mother's Day it was busier than usual and there was a miscommunication. Either way, I wanted to raise my rating to reflect past experiences, and the prompt and courteous treatment by the staff since my last review.",

HH is only at the bar, which has a great ambiance and friendly bartenders. Half the bar is inside and the other outside in the patio. Why does this matter? You can sit inside and not feel the AC, all I felt was the warm air hitting my face. I don't mind, I was raised here, just know that you'll be hot and sweaty. The bar seats aren't the best and felt like I had to re-position myself so that my back wouldn't hurt. The bartenders are mindful of the timing and gave us all a last call for HH. The service was quick, so that's a plus if your coming in for a quick bite. I had 3 HH apps and a pinot grigio, delivered and devoured all within 30 minutes.   It's a good spot for a first date, dining alone, or meeting with friends. I'd love to come back and have some more \"healthy\" eggplant. :)",

He had water & lavash brought out, which I skip the water every where.  I'm very picky on water fyi.   The Mezza Brio pasta & Riccotta stuffed tortellini w/ Vodka sauce was absolutely what we needed.  It was creamy & cheesy.  Also we add lots of red pepper flakes for that kick!   Phil was knowledgeable on the menu since I was indecisive.  I always get the Salmon w/ sweet potatoes salad on the menu & wanted to try something new.  His recommendations were awesome new favorites.  The Benzinger Chardonnay on a hot day is so refreshing also.    Overall, I've never had bad service or food at Brio.  In Iowa & now at the Galleria Mall there is a 'Bravo' restaurant.  They must be owned by the same company cause the menu & decor is almost exact.  Also the Town Square bartender's are always so friendly!  There are two sisters that work there that are the sweetest nicest bartender's & remember what wine you got last time.  Love it!",

They have a new option on their menu where you can order 2, 3, or 4 small dishes of appetizers or side dishes for a decent prize.  Although listed as a small dish, the size and portion is more than enough for a group of 3.    Best thing I've had here and a must for anyone to order is the spicy shrimp with the crusted eggplant.  So delicious and flavorful!  One bite, you'll want to eat the whole dish.  Not too spicy but definitely full of mouth-drooling flavor.    Their brussel sprouts and caprese salad is also delicious as well.  Something I'd definitely order again.   From their cocktails, I got the Cucumber Basil Gimlet with the Hendricks Gin.  Very refreshing and great palate cleanser as well.  Their sangrias are also decent as well.    Service is great and no complaints there.",

She never tried to at least dry it. One thing I do not get about this restaurant is why they only hand out one dessert menu if there was 5 of us on the table.  I had to wait for my turn to look at the menu and while I was picking my dessert the other people in my table already ordered and the server had to come back to ask for mine. In summary, I had to watch my cousin and her friends eat their dessert while I waited for mine. That was ridiculous! Well, at least the dessert was on the house since the server forgot our appetizer. She made up for it. I lost desire with this restaurant. I thought I was going to have a blast...",

    "text": "Brio surprised me with their fresh, delicious food and large portion sizes.  I've been to both the Town Square and Tivoli Village locations, and both are quite pretty inside, reminiscent of the Cheesecake Factory in style.    My favorite starter is the spicy shrimp and eggplant: shrimp over romano crusted eggplant in a black pepper cream sauce, amazing!    For entrees, the lasagna bolognese is HUGE and very delicious, it could easily serve 2 people!  It's layers of noodles in a bolognese sauce topped with alfredo and romano/mozzarella cheese, yum.  If you're looking for something lighter, I would absolutely recommend the grilled salmon salad.  The salmon is cooked perfectly, and sits atop spring greens, asparagus, tomatoes, feta cheese, and crispy shoestring potatoes in a balsamic vinaigrette.  The combination of textures and flavors is really delicious and satisfying, without being too heavy.  The only entree I haven't liked here was the shrimp verduta.  The kids menu is quite impressive as well.  We ordered the salmon ($6.95) for our daughter, it came with a large piece of grilled salmon, mashed potatoes (or sub french fries in our case), steamed broccoli and a drink of her choice.  I could have made a meal of this, it was delicious!  They have other options: chicken parmesan, grilled chicken, lasagna, mac and cheese, burgers and pizzas.    We've ordered catering from here in the past, and it is a great deal!  We ordered the lasagna bolognese, the lobster and shrimp fettucine (shrimp and lobster in a spicy lobster butter sauce) and the pasta brio (penne pasta with chicken, mushrooms, and a roasted red pepper sauce), all for $160.  It comes with a tray of fresh bread, a tray of their crispy flatbread, and we also had a coupon for a free dessert tray with a $100 order.  They gave us a generous serving of their tiramisu.  Each tray serves 6-8 people, and we had enough for 14 people with tons of leftovers.  Everyone had a different favorite pasta, so it was enjoyed by all!",

There was waiter service.  We had a few cocktails and ordered an appetizer and a salad to share.  It was just what I had hoped for for a girls night out.  The cocktails were interesting and very tasty.  The food was good, and what you would expect from a place like this.  The outdoor patio was nice and the service was good.  We implied that we wanted to just drink and be mellow and he left us alone for the most part.    I would go again, very nice place.",

Although I'm not usually a fan of chain restaurants, there are so many other places to eat! But the reason I like Brio is because they have a great happy hour menu.   On Thursdays during HH, martinis are just $5 and the HH food menu has really delicious small plates for only $2.95 each! The girls and I usually order one of everything (don't judge) and justify all that food by telling ourselves it's ok because we're eating early aka during HH time. Some of my favorite small plates are:  -pepperoni flat bread -spicy shrimp and eggplant -spinich and artichoke dip  Brio is worth a try for HH with friends.",

The waiters come round with all sorts of meats and sliced right at ur table and all the varieties of the meats I can't count em all... However my favorite was bacon wrapped filet mignon .

Very attentive and a fantastic personality. She got a good tip for sure. Lastly, the food. Frickin fantastic. I had a mushroom ravioli with an alfredo sauce that knocked my socks off. I also tried the tortellini and lasagna that was also just as good. I would recommend this place to anyone, especially lovers of Italian food.",

They had shot glasses filled with different desserts: Vanilla Creme Brulee, Milk Chocolate Caramel Cake, Tiramisu and Strawberry Cheesecake. We, husband and I, shared them. I like little samplings like this in places that you're unfamiliar with their food, it allows you to taste some of their desserts without having to order a large portion of something that you may not like.   Brio isn't a place that I'll be visiting again, at least any time soon. I wasn't wow'd by anything that they had. The dessert was good but not outstanding.",

    "text": "4 stars? Yes, 4 stars...3 seems too low.  Ideally 3.5 is what I would rate it.  A few notches above Olive Garden, Macaroni Grill, and even Maggiano's. While I don't usually like to eat at \"chain\" restaurants, this has been my saving grace for informal lunch meetings, dinners with unadventurous eaters, and satisfying a group of people with various dietary preferences (low carb, low fat, gluten free, vegetarian).    I highly recommend making reservations for the evening when you have a party of 6 or more, but for lunch I usually have to wait 10-15 minutes.  They give you a pager and you have the freedom to occupy your wait time with shopping in nearby stores.  Once inside, the setting is a pleasing \"Tuscan\" style and the energy/noise level is bustling, but usually I like to sit outside because I usually have my nicely behaved dogs with me. They require I tie my dogs to the outside of the restaurant fence and sit at a nearby table,but I have seen dogs sit on their laps with their owners.  This discrepancy kind of bothers me, because my dogs are well behaved, but like to sit at our feet...many don't notice them but if they do it is because they are cute and well behaved.  Usually I order a flatbread and bruschetta for the table as an appetizer. I usually order the steak salad for lunch, which is phenominal, especially since most places end up making the meat well done or not using a tender meat. The pasta is decent here, at least I never heard my guests complain and usually give raves.   The portions are generous for the price, and usually lasting me two meals.  I have had the steak and vegetables for dinner, which was prepared and cooked nicely. Service is always polite, but sometimes a little slow when it is busy. Again the food is no culinary feat, but it is solid and unoffensive.  While not unique, no one is going to complain and your guests will definitely think it is solid food and come out satisfied and full.    Again a great place where everyone can find something they like and enjoy themselves in a casual, relaxed Italian style.  One other comment, I think they have done a great job with their wine menu. By the glass, plenty of unique and affordable wines covering a range of varietals both whites and reds, but also many familiar, easy drinking wines.  Further, many \"gem\" bottle that are well priced...about 175% markup rather than the 200%+ markups...that can mean atleast $10 -20 savings per bottle.",

    "text": "Me: \"I'll have a Bellini.\"  Bartender:  \"In this bar that is a frozen beverage.  Will that be acceptable?\"  Me:  \"No, thank you, I'll join my husband and have a mojito.  Thanks for telling me.\"  Bartender:  \"You're welcome.  I thought you'd want to know.\"  That got us off to a very good start as we had a 3:00pm lunch in the bar at Brio after an enjoyable visit to Hoover Dam and Lake Mead.  Why the bartender thought I might care if the Bellini was authentic or not I do not know but she was right.  And it was the first step in stellar service that continued through the process of making the drinks, taking our food order and until the time we walked out at the end of our meal.    Not only was the service great, the food exceeded our expectations, and the setting was lovely, hence the four stars.    Brio is part of a small chain and as a rule we avoid chains, in particular when they involve 'staged opulence' interiors as here.  Different strokes for different folks and we simply lean to smaller, privately owned places with less flash..  But a local woman we met at Aria and with whom we discussed food (favorite topic for her too) recommended Brio and thought we'd be pleasantly surprised.  So in need of a late lunch, we headed to Town Center Mall (Whole Foods is also located here) and Brio.  We split the barbequed chicken flatbread and it was tasty...crispy thin crust, delicious sauce with just the right amount of chipotle, white meat chicken, feta and cilantro.  Served very hot from the oven, it was a great partner for the refreshing, well made mojitos..  We finished up by sharing the creme brulee trio, relying on the recommendation of another yelp reviewer, and thought all three brulee options (cleverly presented in demitasse cups) were good for flavor even if the sugar toppings had lost their crispness.  Our food and two cocktails were about $35 so a decent price.    Based on this single experience, we would return to eat at a Brio Tuscan Grille again if we find one at some other point in our travels.",

    "text": "I have dined with Brio Tuscan Grill in the past, but this time felt compelled to review.  I arrived at Brio Tuscan Grille  just before noon on a Friday and to my surprise did not wait to be seated - the restaurant, albeit busy, provided immediate space.  The restaurant is that of a large, open floor, high ceiling dining space.  The \"Tuscan\" decor is immediately apparent and the high ceiling with streaming tapestry is a nice touch.  Regretfully I felt as though I spent the entire meal yelling at my colleague as the roar of the patrons is stifling.  The dining room rumbles with dialogue from the tables, each seemingly attempting to talk louder than the next.  This may be the result of the large dome-like space.  The team serving us was friendly, not unlike the hosts, but did unfortunately need to be reminded of extra table flatware, indications for drink refills, and simple things like a spoon to stir my coffee, however, negating these oversights with accommodating pleasant demeanor.  I cannot speak on my friend, but I ordered the Mezza Chicken Limone and would recommend it to anyone that enjoys characteristic chicken.  Aside from the elegant name, this lunch fare is simply Lemon Chicken with Campanelle Florentine.  The chicken was flavorful, with lemon obvious with each bite, and the bed of greens accented the capers nicely; the portion size is perfect for a healthy lunch as well.  I would also like to note the Campanelle Florentine was just a bit overcooked, but not enough for most to notice.  Again, I recommend the Mezza Chicken Limone and Brio Tuscan Grille to all - we'll see how things are next time: at dinner.",

    "text": "This place is a winner.  Having just relocated from one of the best food meccas in California (SF Bay Area), I have been on a quest for good, non-chain restaurants. Every thing about this place works.  Atmosphere, location, parking, meal any time of the daytime,  excellent menu choices, great service mixed with mediocre, healthy food choices,  small dessert portions, excellent wine choices--I could go on.  In 6 weeks since moving we have been here 5 or 6 times.  I will bring friends here for sure, and I just ate dinner alone in the bar area 2 days ago, & it was perfect for me!!  All you negatives , go elsewhere. This is a fine choice!!",

    "text": "I'll explain the lack of stars.. eventually.    So, we arrived and were seated with only a short wait - and the waiting area had lots of very comfy seats so it wasn't much of an inconvenience at all.  The restaurant is beautifully decorated, with the standard Tuscan paint scheme.  Our servers arrived (one was apparently being trained).. though our waiter didn't introduce himself, the receipt said his name was Rhett so I'll just assume his trainee was Scarlett.  They were very friendly and helpful, and we ordered our meals.  Firstly, our beverages and their bread selection arrived.. the bread was good.  Then our appetizer arrived, the Duetto Toscano Tuscan Dips.  I had a bit of each, thought they were both good but the Chorizo Fonduta was the best of the two.  Hubby, however, went nuts and cleared the rest of the platter... yes, he loved them both quite a lot.. though he gave extra points to the same dip.  The chilled Pepper Formagio was good, just needed something more.. not sure what.  Just a note.. the over-attentive staff was incredibly prompt at grabbing empties off our table, keeping it clear.  Definite kudos to them for this.  Now, for the entrees.. mine was the Sweet Potato & Chicken Risotto..absolutely fantastic.  The blend of flavors & textures was incredible, it was a delight.  Hubby's meal, the Gorgonzola Crusted Bistecca, got rave reviews from hubby though it was overcooked and had to be redone.  No, I didn't taste it.. gorgonzola is evil.  They put mine on a warmer for the duration or replaced it, I have no clue which it was.  He also got the Lobster Bisque which was probably one of the best I've ever tasted.  His side dishes, the mashed potatoes and vegetables, were not particularly noticable.  Now, with the food being good, the service being fantastic, and the ambiance/decor being nice.. why only 3 stars?  Because it was COLD in there, to the point of teeth chattering, stuffed-up noses, shivering bodies.. and I was wearing jeans, a sweater, and sneakers.. clothing that should keep me warm enough in winter, let alone early September.  I only ate a few bites of my meal and had them package it up to bring home.. where I could actually enjoy the food instead of suffering through it.  And, though I complained many times (and they admitted that they were aware of the problem), nothing was done.  Additionally, the food was becoming rapidly chilled and cold risotto is not a good thing.  Perhaps the rest of the food isn't that good and they want people to dull their tastebuds with stuffed-up sinuses?  I have no clue, but I know that I was beyond thrilled when we finally left.  And yes, I had even gone outside during the recooking phase just so I could thaw out a bit, only to have it all undone when I returned.  So.. it was good food, good service, but I doubt if I'll ever want to return there again.. not without Uggs, a parka, and a warming plate for the food.  Overall experience.. miserable.",

    "text": "On a recent trip to Town Square to return some items, a friend and I decided to eat lunch at Brio Tuscan Grill. It was around noon on a Friday, and since there was a wait to sit inside we decided to sit on the patio.   The overall attitude of the hostess worried me a bit... She wasn't welcoming, did not try to engage us in any conversation, walked way ahead of us, and did not check to see if we were ok with the table she put us at. And we weren't, as soon as our waiter came to take our drink orders we asked to be moved to an area that was slightly shaded.   After checking over the menu I was unable to decide so I decided to ask  our waiters to help. We had multiple waiters, one was being trained by the other. Between the snooty hostess and trainee-waiter this could have been a disastrous lunch but thankfully the waiters  did a great job together. They convinced me to to try the citrus garden salad with shrimp. My friend had  the mezza chicken under the brick.   The bread did not come out until after our food, but our food did come out pretty quickly. My salad was huge, had lots of perfectly cooked shrimp and the linguine was surprisingly good, which made me happy since I was worried I wouldn't like noodles on a salad. The dressing was a light lemon vinaigrette, and the dried cranberries and pecans were nice compliments to the cilantro and peppers.   Based on how quickly she devoured it, I think the mezza chicken under the brick was pretty good as well!   Total damage for our 2 lunches and 2 ice teas was right around $30 before tip. I am looking forward to visiting Brio again during happy hour.",

We were here on May 7th celebrating my mother-in-law's birthday.  The appetizers were pretty good but the entrees were definitely lacking.  My husband ordered a chicken Caesar salad and they served him a side salad and brought him a piece of chicken as they said they forgot to put it on the salad.  The salad was on a very small plate and that's how I knew that there was no way that this was a dinner salad.  The fact that the chicken wasn't even on the salad was another dead giveaway.  My son ordered the salmon it was overcooked and it was a very small piece and wasn't worth the $23.  I ordered a side lobster tail and six pieces of shrimp.  I have food allergies and I asked that they steam both, and not add anything to it. Well they grilled both and it was overcooked and very dry.   It definitely was not worth over $200 that we spent.  I'm not sure if we will be visiting this location again.  Very disappointed in the quality  of food that was served.",

It is so pretty inside like you are about to be a witness at a wedding!!! The service is quick & I never encountered  a rude employee (yet)...  This place is one of the few places that my daughter enjoys (too picky)!!! There hasn't been a dish that I have sent back. The bread basket is not only filled with soft bread but you get crispy flat bread with sesame seeds as well...The Pasta Fra Diavolo (Spicy Shrimp wih Angel hair pasta), Cheese Ravioli, Ravioli Caprese(Crispy Cheese Ravioli) & the Wedge Salad are just a few of our favorites.  I just tried Fettuccine Napoli which has Smoked chicken,carmelized onions, broccoli, tomatoes,& chili flakes. The chili flakes is what sold me and sadly, I felt these chili flakes were just flakes minus all the chili. Not spicy at all-what happened ? I also had to add salt (I hate having to add salt to anything). So even though this dish was a miss for me I can still appreciate that just because this is a good restaurant doesn't mean you are going to like everything. Brio can tend to be pricey.... We will be back....",

Many times, that's all I order! The quattro gives you 4 different selections of their famous bruschettas and you get 2 of each one, making it a perfect sharing appetizer (genius!). I'm not a big fan of salads myself, but I LOVE this salad. The steak is prepared medium-rare (again, not usually a fan of bloody steak) but this is fantastic. Of the 10 times that I order this dish, its always just as good as the last. The dressing complements the steak, and the blue cheese, cherry tomatoes, and walnuts put it over the top. We always order it split, so we can share it was well.  My fiance and I have come to Brio many times, sometimes for a light lunch before seeing a movie, and even one time for an impromptu valentine's day lunch date ... She and I could have gone to a fancy fine dining establishment, but there is just something about Brio and its amazing food and outstanding service that is hard to pass up. The only downside, if you can even call it a downside, is the pricing. It's not totally ridiculous but it is pricey enough to make Brio a twice a month visit, if that.",

Brio was a great treat - I actually like this place better than some of the restaurants we went to in Italy.  Not that the Italian food in Italy didn't taste good, but the bold flavors at Brio were more pleasing to my palette.  Large, open, tastefully decorated, the mood was set for relaxation.  Went there with 4 of my team members and this was all our first visit.  The only down was that the acoustics and ambient noise didn't make for the best conversation but as long as your voice was strong, you were good.  Service was good and staff was pleasant and orders came out accurately (and quickly).  The Caprese Bruchetta rocked.  Lots of flavor and great texture.  The sweet balsamic was the perfect addition.  The Caprese Ravioli was equally as good.  Lots of fresh baby tomatoes to season the dish.  Large pieces of pasta and hearty enough to make a meal.  I had the Sweet Potato and Grilled Chicken Risotto.  DELICIOUS.  I wasn't sure what to expect as it seemed like an odd combination but they pulled it off nicely.  Add in some fresh asparagus and i was very satisfied with the meal.  At the table was also salmon, tomato bisque, and the lasagna.  All said they enjoyed their meals.  We had everything except alcohol and we were out of there for around $150.  Definitely will go here again.",

I suggest sitting in the bar and trying out this happy hour.  It seemed popular, and the price can't get any better unless it is Freeeeeeeeeeeeeeee!",

As soon as I sat down, our server handed me a menu and took my drink order (strawberry lemonade FTW!);  She quickly returned with my beverage, and I was ready to order... Steak salad.  Weird, I thought, but it turned out to be soooooo good!  Our service continued to be on point, and we left quite satisfied.  The mini size desserts are perfect to complete any meal.  I had a cute sized creme brulee that didn't leave me overwhelmed.  I will be back here next time I'm in Vegas. The location in Town Square is great.  There's meter parking right outside.  Covered free parking also available for those who don't mind a short walk.",

Totally recommend! I tried the lobster pasta and my husband got the pork.  Both excellent. The only reason I gave 4 starts was because we ordered salads and never got them.  However Geoff was awesome and took the salads off our bill and provided us a free dessert:)",

    "text": "Last Wednesday was the first day of live calls at our call center, so to celebrate the executive and support staff went to Brio Tuscan Grille for a celebratory dinner.  I've never been to Town Square before...driving around in here gave me a feeling of not being in Vegas...more akin to being down on Rodeo Drive in LA (I know it's nothing like it but it's the feeling I got).    Stepping into the building, I was impressed with the high ceilings and tall back wall that looked like it had been delivered from Rome itself.  It was very loud in the restaurant because of the openness of the space (it's very spacious for seating and the bar area) but I was able to find my group very easily and interact without much trouble.  The wine, appetizers, salads, bread and soup were all excellent.  The choice in breads was nicely done to not bore you with a simple roll.  The entree's were classic italian faire, however I ordered a steak (not in the mood for lasagna or something pasta).  It was cooked wonderfully; I wasn't the only one to order the steak...all enjoyed theirs, too.  Desserts were served in a type of large shot glass with flavors such as Creme Brulee and Tiramisu, among others.  I loved scooping into the tiramisu and finding a different flavor every scoop.  It was a little pricey for my taste; since I was part of a group and the company was footing the bill, I was more than happy to attend.  I would come here only if I wasn't paying.  If I were tasked with taking care of the check, I could find quieter, more intimate places to get the most bang for my buck.",

Good quality food for such a little price.   The service was great despite the fact that the server was by herself (or so I overheard). Sarah was her name. She managed to keep a smile on her face and was very polite.  The best plate from my happy hour was the Spicy shrimp and eggplant. The crusted eggplant had a sligh crunch and paired nicely with the black pepper cream sauce. However, the shrimp tasted spicier than the eggplant for some reason.   The Brio Burger was decent.. Go for the other tasters instead.   I also enjoyed the sliced steak bruschetta. The tender pieces of steak were topped with yummy gorgonzola.  I wish there was drink specials on the menu... ::sad face::  The seating area in the bar was very nice. There was two lounge areas complete with a love seat and arm chairs. Luckily, I got there in time to bag one!  The mini desserts looked so good but I choose just one. The vanilla creme brulee. The strawberries tasted so well with the vanilla custard. I which I ordered three of them! One was simply not enough!!  Brio! I've never been to Italy but I think you just gave me a small taste of it!",

Everything was phenomenal and came out perfectly timed! We shared the white peach sangria and it was crisp, sweet and refreshing.

    "text": "Opted for a small/quick Sunday lunch at Brio with my two kiddos in Town Square, as it was on my radar of nicer restaurants in Town Square for my fiance's birthday party reservations later this week. I left feeling pretty disappointed.   I don't like waitstaff who start out very nice and then snub you when you just order an appetizer and drinks. It was lunchtime, not prom night. Geezus. Our waiter's attitude changed instantly when we ordered a bruschetta, kids meal and drinks. He actually said, \"That's it?\"  He never came back to check on our drinks or to clear dishes. He was in an ass-kissing conversation with the table across from us when he dropped off the check, it was an absolute after thought.   The bruschetta sampler was delicious, and my daughter liked her kids lasagna, but I won't be coming back thanks to the service. I am not willing to risk putting our group of friends & family through crappy service for an expensive, special occasion dinner.   I understand that society believes it acceptable to tip off the dollar amount of a meal. This is why waiters get annoyed when you don't spend the big bucks, I get it. I, however, tip off the quality of the service. I believe a customer who orders an ice tea deserves the same great service as a customer who orders a $500 meal.   Sorry, Brio. Epic FAIL.",

    "text": "I'm not the biggest fan of chain restaurants. Olive Garden, Cheesecake Factory, Outback--you catch my drift? To my palette, everything tastes the same--buttery & salty. I've sampled the Brio dinner menu on numerous occasions and I will not be returning for any entrees.  THE BAR: I frequent Brio for an entirely different reason: a half indoor / half outdoor bar that brings refinement to the ever frowned upon day drinking. In the Spring & Summer, I can be seen in my designer heels relaxing by the bar with a book, sipping on a glass of over-priced shiraz or moscato on a bright, sunny Tuesday afternoon. Town Square is such a pleasant place. A little pop-up of class down the street from what I consider to be the tackiest shopping mall in Las Vegas (Premium Outlets South).   BAR FOOD: I can't help but jump for joy at cheap food. Brio has a bar menu that's only $2.95 a plate. I've sampled everything on that menu. At 3 bucks a pop, I think I can afford to do so. Serving size is pretty big too. I always order the beef carpaccio: thin-slices of raw beef drizzled with olive oil and other delectables. The flat-breads and ravioli are mediocre. The spicy shrimp is too salty. The burger is a burger. And the ravioli is pretty basic. Then again, at those prices I wouldn't expect anything too fancy.  In short, olive garden food at cheap prices, alcohol, and a pleasant drinking environment to make your day-drinking the slightest bit more upscale.",

We arrived a little after 1pm and noticed it was busy, lots of people were standing around waiting.  So we went inside and I asked the hostess how long the wait was and was told 15-20 minutes.  She asked for my name and phone number and we went back outside and browsed some nearby shops.  We came back and sat outside at a bench by the restaurant and still didn't hear anything.  I checked my phone frequently and made sure I had my ringer on. More time passed, nearly an hour and we went inside to see how long the wait would be.  The hostess looked up my name on a computer and another hostess immediately showed us to a table.  We realize it was busy BUT if we hadn't checked back with the hostess we would still be outside waiting to hear my phone ring.  So why did the hostess bother to get my phone number if they weren't going to call in the first place?  We felt our time was wasted waiting around for a call.  Maybe they should invest in those pager things that other restaurants give out that buzz and light up when your table is ready.  The food was pretty good.  We ordered lobster bisque, my boyfriend had an omelet and I had the stuffed french toast with berries.  Our waiter was an older gentleman who picked up on the fact that my boyfriend was pissed when we first arrived.  He was very attentive and had a calm and playful manner.  So I would give the food 4 stars, but because of the hostesses lack of hospitality and indifference I have to give Brio Tuscan Grille 3 stars.",

I did so. That was four months ago. We tried again, but were treated about the same.  I wish I hadn't taken down my original posting, but I do have the letter here on Yelp, that was written by Brio, saying if I'd take it down, they'd make things right. :(  Never again",

If you are looking for a restaurant experience devoid of tourists, Brio definitely focuses their attention on the locals.   It was nice to enjoy a nice glass of wine while paired with my Frutti di Mare, an assortment of seafood with thin spaghetti. It was well seasoned and tasty. Not only was the food good, the impeccable service made the experience quite memorable. Brio would be a good choice especially if you happen to be shopping at Town Square.",

We started with their white peach sangria and beef carpaccio, spicy shrimp & eggplant, and four cheese pizzeta.  We thought that the food wouldn't be enough, but boy were we wrong!  The portions are HUGE for the price.  One appetizer for each of us would have been enough.  The flat bread pizza was good and paired well with our sangrias.  But our favorite dishes are the spicy shrimp & eggplant and beef carpaccio.  The spicy shrimp was laid on top of the eggplant with this creamy sauce ladled around it.  The beef carpaccio is definitely a star all on its own.  Its such a steal to get a huge plate full of thinly sliced beef for less than 4 bucks.  I've carpaccio at sushi restaurants, but this was way different.  The beef melted in your mouth and I could've probably scarfed down the whole plate if I wasn't sharing it.    My first time there did not disappoint.  I'll definitely be back for a beef carpaccio of my own and try some other things on the menu.",

Thought I'd finally leave a review after coming  here so many times! This time they had seasonal items and we ordered the scallops risotto and the pasta ala vodka. The food is maybe just a bit semi pricier than it should be, but I figure you're paying for the setting and the nice service. Love the sourdough bread they give when seated!",

We were seated at the corner of their patio--perfect! It was like a mini impromptu date. It's like gold to be able to escape from 4 kids! Love them gremlins beyond the furthest sun but good gosh do they suck the bone marrow out of you.  My husband ordered the Pesto pasta as I opted for the sliced steak bruschetta. Both were absolutely deelish! I love how my steak melted with the bruschetta! Portioning ratio was definitely adequate for us. They are a tad pricey, in my opinion, but alot of fancier Italians places just are. The best part of Brio is that it is a place that is both classy and casual.  We ordered a couple drinks which I don't even remember their names. Lol. I will say this...bartender was NOT greedy about the alcohol content whatsoever! Husband and I were looking at each other like, how the hell are we buzzing already? Lightweights. Lol.  I'm giving this place 5 stars because while the two items we tried were pretty good but that caramel marscapone cheesecake! Wholly deelish! Please do not fail to order this when you stop in or fail to make room for it. Don't even share it! Hahaha. It's THAT deelish!!!",

    "text": "The experience at Brio Tuscan Grille was not one bit short of SUPERB!  My family couldn't stop ranting and raving about this place for days, and I was tickled to have pleased such a difficult group!  I had my son's graduation lunch here.  He graduated from UNLV last May 13th, and we were all from Los Angeles.  From the moment I contacted Brio's Banquet Team, Nova (Banquet Manager) was so wonderful to communicate with... so patient and careful to answer all my questions quickly since we're from L.A..  I tried the big Vegas hotel buffets first and most of the banquet/catering staff were difficult to deal with -  very slow to respond and I never felt like they even cared about my small but large party of 25.  They really made me feel like we weren't a big deal to them.  With their high prices for the Mother's Day weekend, I had high expectations so my patience wore thin very quickly.  Brio did not even require a deposit for our event, yet Nova had a clearly written Event Proposal showing the details of our meal selections and the pricing.  No surprises!  Like clockwork, we were seated at exactly 2:00 pm as stated on our Event Proposal!  Then we met THE MAN....  Amit, our head server!  He was an amazing guy who lit up our tired selves with his positive energy and excellent service skills.  He said we were his first large group, but no one believed that!  The food arrived also like clockwork... it was almost like a staged show.  The intervals were perfectly in sync with our guests' eating behaviors.  We couldn't believe that service!  First drinks, then appetizers, then salads, the main course dishes and dessert... all perfectly timed in harmony.  The entire time, Amit was checking in with me, in constant communication with me and on top of the whole game.  Even small details like no empty drink glasses and lemon wedges were never forgotten.   By the end of dessert, we were about to take this man home with us to L.A., he was so good!!!!  The entire family loved him and just could not stop speaking kind words about him!    The food was amazingly awesome... from the calamari, to the lemon chicken, to the grilled salmon... and that amazing \"we wanted to lick the plate\" vodka pasta!!!!  The dessert was the icing on the cake....  caramel marscapone cheesecake in small cups topped with whipped cream!  Delicious to the last bite!!!!   All were scrumptious dishes that warmly satisfied our hunger pains after 5 long hours of graduation ordeals and traffic.   Nova, Amit and the BRIO Banquet Team -   A HUGE THANK YOU FROM THE SANTOS FAMILY OF CALIFORNIA!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!  WE LOVED EVERY MINUTE THERE!!!!!!!",

If you want to know what a bangladeshi taxi drivers asshole tastes likes...please try brio.  Brio is basically the mcdonalds, or wendys of italian food.  The crowd here is on the trashier side. The one at tivoli has the same shitty food, but with a more prosperous and much older crowd. The good news is tivoli has live music in the summer. I will probably be going there for *drinks only* whenever they have music.",

    "text": "Attention: Their Happy Hour Menu is BETTER than McCormick & Schmicks!  I thought I would never say this, but for the quality (better) & price (same) you can get more for your tummy & money here.  Monday - Thursday 3 - 7 PM, 9 - 11 PM + Friday 3 - 7 PM you can enjoy their Tuscan Tasters menu for $2.95. You don't even have to purchase a beverage to get this deal either...just sit in the bar area.   The bar area is half-inside and half-outside with a bar, but also high tables and even some nice chairs (but they go fast!)  We tried the:  *Brio Burger - great \"soft\" burger w/ homemade chips Ravioli Caprese - crusted ravioli w/ tomato/mozzarella drizzle Spicy Shrimp & Eggplant - seared shrimp & breaded eggplant Sausage & Pepperoni Flatbread - self-explanatory on cracker bread Steak Bruschetta - steak & arugala on french bread  Liked all of them...burger & pizza were the most filling. Shrimp was small, but tasty. Bruschetta & ravioli had a nice taste to them.  Dessert Trio: hazelnut/chocolate cannoli, caramel cheesecake & choc chip bread pudding.   This dessert was awesome! We were about to leave, but I saw the dessert tray (better seeing what you're getting in person - great marketing tactic for visual learners like me) and was hooked!   Each dessert had tons of flavor that you had to take small bites to enjoy each sensation in your mouth.   I can't say enough great things about this place. The fact it was off the strip and mostly locals went there was one of the best parts. I learned that waking the strip is quite overrated....  Service was great and I am definitely hitting this place up EVERYTIME I go to vegas...",

This shocked me and put me off quite a bit. I'm 100% Italian and for an Italian restaurant not to have traditional pizzas is just a huge no-no. Like a burger joint that doesn't serve burgers and fries. However, they do have 4 choices of American style flat-breads that can be ordered on pizza dough. But it's just not the same.   I've been here before and the other few dishes I've tried are very tasty. Although, I do not consider this to be an Italian restaurant. More of an American take on Italian cuisine. Still good but not what I was looking for.",

The tables were not set up to my liking and the service was slow and not very thorough. Actually,  we were lacking food servers. They did a great job rearranging the tables,  however, the manpower used for my party was inadequate  It took about 45 minutes to get the beverages to all the guests and the courses had to much delay between them. Keep in mind I only had 15 adults. When we finally did get the food it was excellent. Based on this experience I would dine there with a small group of people,  but hosting a party is not there strong suit. Additionally,  I never met the Banquet Manager or the Assistant Banquet Manager. Did not get a sense that they cared if my party was a success or not, I got the feeling they were only interested in my money. I do NOT recommend this place for a banquet or party. They are way to disorganized to host a great party.",

The portions seem to have gotten a bit smaller since they first started doing happy hour, but it is as delicious as ever.  The specials are also only at the bar area or patio area, so be sure to snag the first seat you see; it's first come first serve.  My favorites have been the Spicy Shrimp and Eggplant (you have to scoop up every bit of that sauce!), Braised Meatballs and Polenta (I had no idea what polenta was before this, but now I love it), and the Sliced Steak Bruschetta.  There are many more items on the menu but these have stood out to me the most.  Dining outside is great, especially in front of a roaring fire on a cool fall evening.  Inside is nice but it gets loud.  My biggest complaint is the service; it can be difficult to get your waiters attention, even though it's been a while since they've checked on you.  Still, the cheap eats make this a must try.",

The menu is long enough to have a lot of great options, but not ridiculously epic-noval-ish enough to make you want to give up (Cheesecake Factory, that's you, buddy, but I'll still come visit every once and a while when I can't decide beforehand on a particular type of food I want at the time). The servers are nice and the patio is awesome, when the weather's right. The inside is a large, mostly open space that can get a little loud-ish during peak times, but not so unbearable that you have to yell to your eating companion(s). The price is what you'd expect to pay: not the cheapest, but not that pricey, either; I consider it a slightly less-expensive alternative to my other favorite Vegas/Henderson Italian joints, Casa di Amore, Nora's, and Gaetano's.",

    "text": "Tried some of their appetizers during the Yelp fundraising bake sale, and dropped by again for Suki L.'s Happy Hour UYE.  I have to say for the $2.95 price tag on their selections of hour hour menu, the food was delicious and the portions were fair.  My favorites on their new Spring 2011 Happy Hour menu are the Spicy Shrimp and Eggplant (the Black Pepper Sauce is great with pretty much anything savory, try it withthe BRIO Burger or the shrimp from the Shrimptini), followed closely by the Marghita Flatbread.  I would also recommend The Beef Carpaccio, BRIO Burger,and as far as their Strawberry Lemonade (non-alcoholic).  If you are not working during the weekday afternoon,and happens to be at Town Square shopping or watching a movie or whatever, drop by for inexpensive and very good food.  But plan on arriving around 3:30pm,as the HH is only valid at the bar area, which fillsup rather quickly.  Thanks again to Suki L for organizing the UYE here, so I try their HH. And like Anthony M, I think this is also one of my favorite HH in Vegas.  Decor: 5/5 It reminded me of the decor at The Cheese Cake Factory, but with their own twist.  Ilike it.  Ambiance: 4/5  It has good atmosphere.  Service: 5/5  The bartenders, waiters,bussers were all great.  Even when it is busy, they paid attention to the customers making sure our orders are placed and our drinks are refilled.  Food:  4/5  Based on the HH menu only.  I liked most of the food I ordered, while some I am glad I tried but would likely not order again now that I know which ones I really like.  Price:  5/5 for HH             3/5 for non-HH.  Location:  Perfect for those visiting Town Square for the entertainment, shopping, or food.  4 stars. I will definitely be back.",

I went with a group, so I was able to try several other items as well. The pork chops were delicious, but I don't eat much pork these days. If I did, I might order this myself. The lobster bisque was just okay. The last thing I tried was the Shrimp Mediterranean and it was the best of all. It's served with orzo pasta, which is my favorite.

Originally, I was going to give them 4 stars. I bumped it to 5 because of how friendly and easy they were to work with. I had to deliver a wedding cake there. Many venues don't allow the cake to get there too early, but they let me deliver it early and they carefully stored it and presented it to the client.  It was 3 tiers.

Bread is top notch, worth the price of admission.  No dessert this time, maybe next.  Server's name: Trevor.",

    "text": "I was in Las Vegas for the first time.  A friend took us to lunch at Brio, and since I'd been looking forward to meeting her there the entire trip, and the experience was awesome, they could have served Peanut Butter and Jelly, and I'd probably rave about it.  But Brio serves much better food than that.  The setting is cute, very tall ceilings, Mediterranean style, chic.  The service was friendly and attentive.  The menu had enough of a variety that I had a hard time making up my mind.   Well, that and we gabbed away for 20 minutes before even looking at the menus!  We shared the Brushcetta Sampler and Lobster Bisque appetizers.  (I can't resist Lobster Bisque)  Brio's version was rich and creamy, with good lobster flavor.  I do like more large chunks of lobster meat in my bisque, though.  The bruschetta was a total winner.  There were 4 different types, which our server described as she set down the platter.  I loved the BLT bruschetta.  There was also a Roasted Pepper, and a Beef and Arugula.  They were all fabulous.  Our entrees were:  A chicken and veggie pasta in a light cream sauce (Friend), a Chicken and Applewood Bacon Panini (the Boy), and Scallops with Arugula, Roasted Tomatoes, and Lemon sauce (Me).  Could we be any different?  And yet, each entree was great.  The Scallops weren't overcooked.  (BIG Plus)  The pasta was huge, and the cream sauce wasn't cloying and heavy, and the Boy's panini was crusty, savory goodness.  We shared their dessert sampler (Photo) consisting of miniature cups of selected samples.  Tiramisu, Raspberry Cheesecake, Brownie Sundae, Blackberry Rhubarb Compote, and Apple Caramel Ala Mode.  HOLY YUM!!  (Tiramisu was rated the Best, followed in my opinion by the Blackberry Rhubarb Compote.)  The experience was awesome, the company was fabulous, and the food was great.  I can't wait to visit the one we've got at HOME!  In Denver!   I'm so excited!",

But the lobster bisque was amazing.  That was some good ass bisque.  The warm fresh bread that they brought out complemented the bisque.  I did hear some comments from co-workers that the there was less vegetarian options on the dinner menu vs. the lunch/brunch menu.     I'm not going to compare it chains like Macaroni Grill or Olive Garden.  But I did like the ambiance and service was good.  I've never been to Tuscany but if it's all about the feast, Brio certainly is a good place to go for big groups if your in Town Square.",

This dish was $22 and they charged me extra for the asparagus. The plate looked like it was completely empty. The steak, smaller than my palm. The asparagus I was charged extra for, was undercooked and bland. I asked for Dr Pepper, received Coke and then when I finally tacked down my second server of the night due to a shift change that left us completely neglected, the Dr Pepper was flat and watered down. My boyfriend liked his sweet potato Risotto, but the serving size was also very small. It's loud, freezing, and an overall unenjoyable place. Wouldn't ever come here again. Huge waste of money and an afternoon.",

I had just had the pleasure of the drink at Harry's Bar and the Four Seasons in Florence, so the Bellini had some tough competition, but withstood the test!  We chose the scrumptious and spicy shrimp and egglant, the shrimptini, and punctuated it with the sliders, which turned out to be one big burger cut in quarters. We preferred the steak bruschetta, but enjoyed the happy hour fun before our golf lesson across the street!  Funny waitress, and a great table in the shade near the bar!",

When we first were seated, the chairs had food on them and we had to switch them out. We decided to order drinks, which took about 20 mins to come. For our entrees  My boyfriend ordered the chicken limone and I ordered the pasta pesto. It took an entire hour to come to the table. In between the wait, the waiter and manager came over at several times saying it was \"coming out soon \" when the food finally arrived, they informed us they had no angel hair pasta and instead gave us fettuccine. It was old clumpy and not cooked. The meal looked gross and even the waitress agreed it was terrible. The manager came over and apologized but never offered us anything except to remake our food that would take another hour. I will not be returning here ever again!!!!",

I had ordered one of their flatbread pizzas which was good but not nearly as good as my friend's short rib. She shared some of hers with me and that's where my love affair began. That taste of heaven remained with me ever since... I went back and ordered it for while in Vegas for my birthday. They serve it over a cheesy polenta along with Brussels sprouts and oh my goodness.. the flavors all meshed together so well. This was the best meal that I've had in a restaurant. Unbelievably delicious. The short rib is fork tender and melts in your mouth. Full of flavor! I was also given a caramel mascarpone cheesecake for dessert. Perfect sized portion and very rich and decadent! Soooo good! I ordered it again yesterday during a late lunch and their steak salad which was really delicious. Service and quality of food has been outstanding at both locations. I'm really surprised that they don't charge more for their food. Their price point is excellent for what you get. highly recommend this restaurant to anyone who is looking for a great dining experience.. A great pick for a special occasion. Very nice ambiance too.. Don't forget to order the short rib and the cheesecake! You won't regret it!",

I finished my drink fairly quick and the service was just ridiculously slow the entire time, especially for not being busy. 30 minutes later the food came which sucked because our appetizer was served with our entree... What was the point of the appetizer then. I don't know. Very annoying. After our food was dropped off the server never came back to our table. Never checked on us or refilled our drinks. I actually wanted crushed red pepper flakes and didn't have the chance to ask for any because he never checked on us. Finally when I saw him walk by I asked for the check and a box. Paid right away and left.  Although the service was horrible I really liked the spinach dip. My pasta wasn't very good.

Here's the breakdown:  Atmosphere: Gorgeous! I love the decor of this restaurant and it's high ceilings. It's always decorated so lovely during this holidays.  Food: Overall, good.  Calamari- bland. It needed the accompanying sauces to make it have any flavor.  Spinach & Artichoke dip- very tasty, although the crackers that come with it are not a good match for the dip. The crackers are asiago cheese crackers and the asiago conflicts with the cheese in the dip. I ended up just getting more bread and using that with the dip. It was much better.   Chopped Salad- Tasty, but very onion heavy. Don't go kissing anyone after eating this salad!  Lasagna- delicious. Cooked perfectly.   Service: Just AWFUL. Our server NEVER came by. Our meal took over 2 hours. It was ridiculous. Now, I could have understood if the place was crazy busy, but it really wasn't. You know it's bad when you have to ask the busybody multiple times to get our server. We got there around 8pm and didn't leave until well after 10pm.  Prices: Very fair. The portion size and quality is in line with the prices.  Overall, I will come back to Brio for their food and atmosphere, but if I get seated in the section of the server we had again I am going to request to move to a different table, as I have a life and would like to get to it someday, rather than spending it at a 3 hour dinner.",

    "text": "Our friends suggested Brio for dinner one night.  I've had it bookmarked since I've started yelping so of course I wanted to go!  The dining area is elegant.  I loved the decor.  You can dine outside but we chose inside.  Service here was impeccable.  Our waitress was outstanding.  She gave us great suggestions for our meal.    We started off sharing the spinach dip.  Creamy and full of flavor.  I'd definitely order this again.  For my entree I ordered the grilled salmon fresca. This had perfectly grilled asparagus, sweet potatoes, spinach and red peppers topped with the grilled salmon.  I loved the vegetables.  The salmon was a little over cooked but not bad overall.  Dessert? Of course! They offer little dessert shooters.  I tried the chocolate caramel cake shooter.  Oh yeah.... I'd have that again.  Our friends ordered the dessert sampler including creme brulee, bread pudding and cheesecake.  Absolutely delicious!   I believe Brio is one of the better choices in the Town Square area.  I hope to be back soon!",

I choose the shrimp risotto with tomato bisque. The soup was the best thing. The sourdough bread was fantastic, but my risotto was disappointing. I think it was a little over cooked. The shrimp were great. Cooked fresh to perfection, but I think the risotto might have been sitting around awhile. Seemed more like oatmeal. A bit bland too. For an $11 lunch item it was very small. Smallest portion at the table of five. The club sandwich next to me was at least twice as much food. I cleaned my plate and was satisfied but not full. The guy next to me couldn't finish his sandwich and homemade chips, which were pretty good.",

We walk right past all of the people to the bar area where we always find a spot for 2. If there's no seating at the bar on the inside we sit outside.  The food is always great and the staff is usually pretty good. They bring the traditional bread before the meal.  My favorite meal of all time is the Parmesan crusted beaf medallions. It has a slightly different name now because the crust is different but it tastes the same.",

It has been quite a while since my visit, I wasn't even going to review, but there is a dish that is still on my mind, even today, so I feel it's worth a shout out. The best thing we ate here was the roasted grapes. My folks kind of looked at me cross-eyed when I ordered it, but it is easily one of the best dishes I have ever had. My parents still talk about it. This dish was perfectly executed. The texture and flavor of these sweet little gems was so delightful, I forgot where I was and went savage with my fingers. I just could not get enough.   All of our food was very very good. I'd give 5 stars, but our service was lackluster. Not sure if someone called out or our server was just not good, but we seldom saw him very and when he did stop by, he wasn't very helpful.   Despite that, Brio is a beautiful restaurant with great food that will be a pleasure to visit again.",

    "text": "This is an excellent go-to spot for dinner after enjoying a night at TownSquare.   I have ate here with my wife and kids on multiple occasions without ever being disappointed.     What we ordered on our most recent visit:  1) Shrimp Risotto with Lobster Tail -  2) Lobster Bisque 3) Grilled Salmon off the kids' menu 4) Cheese Pizza off the kids' menu 5) Crab Cake as a added side  While some reviews will say the menu is hit-or-miss, you will be happy if you ordered any of the above items.  The lobster bisque was delicious with a good amount of actual lobster in the soup.  The complimentary bread initially served upon being seated was great for dipping into it.   The shrimp risotto and lobster tail was excellent.  The lobster tail was mouth-watering and the cheesy risotto was bedded with a generous amount of great-sized shrimp.   My kids' loved their dishes and the crab cake, albeit on the small side, was very tasty and not expensive.  The ambience inside the restaurant is nice enough for a romantic date for two but also enjoyable for families or a group of friends.  On Tuesday's starting at 5pm until 9pm, live music is provided which elevates the entire dining experience.   Loud, but not loud enough where you can't make audible conversation at the table.  Our servers have always been well accommodating to our every need.   We have had no problems here.  I will add that on previous visits I've also had a good experience ordering the beef carpaccio, caprese salad, brio steak salad, as well as the chicken limone.   While others might have said  'hit or miss' I've come to note that their menu so far has been one giant bullseye.",

Service is very hit or miss and the more people I have spoke to the more people that agree with that waiters and waitresses are both very nonchalant and personalities are lacking with just about every single one of them. I have also ordered catering from here as a request from a client but no one was satisfied with the quality, flavor or taste. In this day and age it is absolutely apalling and insulting that there isn't one vegan or dedicated vegetarian plate on the menu. It wouldn't hurt your establishment only help it if you could cater to all communities by at least offering something to at least pretend you care. Brio is solely for ambience never for service or food. ",

We ask what happened, we are told it's a new change. Ok... let's give dinner a try.   We order the salmon salad and mushroom ravioli. The salad is now a cheap looking salad that looks like it came out of a bag, and a tiny piece of fish. The ravioli is dry!!   We asked for our check and left.

The location is CLEAN and open and busy.  All of the locations have a bar that wraps around from inside to the outside patio with a cover and misters... since it gets so darn hot in Vegas. I love that and love to sit out there when its not soooo hot.   Parking here can be a challenge depending on the day, so you will want to park in the South Parking Garage and walk across the street.  Now, if you start with an appetizer and a few cocktails and decide to move to the main dinning area for dinner, they are more than happy to accommodate you. Or.... if your fine in the spot you have choose, DONT want to move to the dinning room.. you can do that too.   The Staff here is AWESOME!  I cant tell you how many times I have been here looking to get a booth in the Bar area for happy hour, to meet some friends, and the waitress or waiter has made it a point to watch out for me to grab the next open one :).  I love it when people are nice and looking out for you.    the food is GREAT, Service is GREAT, location is CLEAN and Bright AND... It can accommodate a TON of people.   This is my Favorite Happy Hour spot for Vegas... so far!",

I might have given five stars, but we listened to several female bartenders complain over... and over... and over again about what a bad day they had at work. We get it- it was busy. Please be more mindful of what your patrons are listening to. The side of the bar we were on was empty- there certainly wasn't a wait for the restaurant. It was a bummer to listen to them complain. They were VERY nice to us- food was amazing- the mood was just a bummer. We'll think twice before coming back with so many other nearby options. No weekend happy hour.",

Noise levels can be a little loud when it's really busy because of the open air design. The bar area is small but acomadating with full menu.  They also have a large outdoor seating area with umbrellas and patio heaters to help keep the temperature just right during your dining experience.  They have a good happy hour and morning Sunday all you can drink mirmosas.  Good food, great wine good times!",

I guess she didn't like it cause I was friendly with her and she wasn't nice at all",

I get this intimidating look and he walks away. Upon returning he slams the bread down on the table and wals away. I asked for my steak Rare.  It was served Medium. We ordered Brussel Sprouts. They were served after half our meal was finished.   Absolutely terrible service",

First of all if your planning on having a wedding or any reception here, I don't recommend Brio Tuscan Grille for it. The room isn't very private, they don't have doors to close it off, they just have curtains. You can hear everyone in their main dinning room. The worst part was my table was by the kitchen. While the wedding party was saying their speeches, all I can hear was plates being bang left and right, the staff having LOUD conversations and overall a ton of feedback.   The food that was severed was family style. We had a chicken dish (very dry), fish was pretty good (that's what my one star rating is for), pasta (was alright) bread and salad (not enough dressing). The food presentation was so messy and dirtying looking.   Very upsetting on how they rushed us the whole dinner. They should have slowed down on clearing our plates and focused more on customers service and filling up our water.   Lots of other restaurants in the areas to choose from.",

For happy hour you need to sit in the bar area, either inside or out and there are a few high top tables that are included. We arrived at 5:40 and had about an hour left of happy hour which runs until 6:30. The movie started at 7:30 so we had time to chill.  For drinks waters, a white peach sangria 5/5 and a cucumber basil gimlet 3/5. For apps we ordered the beef carpaccio 5/5, shishito pepper hash 5/5 very nice flavoring with the sriracha aioli and the potato skins topped with cheddar cheese sauce, applewood bacon, green onions and lime crema 4/5. Service was wonderful and very attentive. They came by to let us know it was happy hour last call so we got another round of sangrias and another beef carpaccio.   Thank you Brio for providing such a nice start to our evening at Town Square.",

Miriam our server said to save the bread to dip the sauce in.  We ordered the brio burger. 6.00 dollars. The meat was beyond delicious. So good. Came with house chips.   The trio bruschetta was the only disappointment. Nothing fancy. Very small portion.   Great romantic happy hour scene.   Our server was beyond attentive and friendly. Thank you Miriam.",

    "text": "Came here tonight for my moms birthday dinner and honestly we were really disappointed in our time here tonight. From the get go it was one thing wrong after another. We sat down and got our bread, butter and water.   We then ordered an appetizer and while we were waiting asked for more bread which we never got until asking a second time. Then when the apps finally came out there was only three settings instead of six. I had to get up and go to another table and grab three extra settings for the rest of our party. Such a rookie mistake on the service.   Then after placing our dinner and salad order we wait for fifteen minutes for our salads to come to no avail. I finally ask Mandy where our salads are and she said they would be ready in one minute. By that time I'm annoyed because I know that the dinner would be coming out any minute. And I really wanted my salad. Who wants to eat their salad in one minute or eat it with their main course. So I told her I didn't want it but my dad still wanted his. He finally gets his Cesar but as predicted our dinners come out thirty seconds later. They should have held our dinners until my dad was finished with his salad. But the food runners didn't care.   Then for my moms birthday desert we had to tell Mandy and remind her even though we told the hostess when we made the reservation. Why do the hostesses ask if we are celebrating anything if we have to tell our server in front of our mom that its her birthday?   They comped our appetizer which was nice. So one star for that. But we really just couldn't enjoy our dinner fully because of the lack of attention to detail with the service. This is probably our last time here.",

My favorite one is the Beef Carpaccio, and the eggplant shrimp. The drinks on the happy hour menu were decent and I think it's a little diluted on the alcohol.

    "text": "UPDATED: Jesse the GM reached out to me. He listened to my concerns and wanted to make things right. This is my reason why I changed from 1 star to 5 stars!! We ordered drinks- they were really good. Margarita and Apple Martini. The Shrimp egg plant was ok. It was heavily flavored. Need like noodles or something with it. The flat bread was.. ehh. But the lobster and shrimp fettuccine had a really yummy light flavor. I loved it. We also like the ravioli. That was really good as well! Overall, Jesse won us back for how sincere he was. Next time we will try a healthier entree and see what that tastes like.   OLD REVIEW: I gave them a second chance. I regret it. First try here was yesterday 6/11/18 with 3 girlfriends I dragged out of the house. We were seated outside right next to the mist by the sidewalk where foot traffic was plenty. Beautiful atmosphere. Our server came and for the first few minutes she was sweet and nice. She grew impatient and short after we asked her several questions regarding drinks. The difference between the tropical martini and this other martini. So I decided to just cut it short and order something to resolve the initial interaction. She brought our drinks all was well. Food came out.. I asked for silverware. My girls are halfway through their food and I had to catch a busy boy on his way back to the kitchen and ask for napkins and silverware as she never came back with any. It was pretty quiet yesterday. Not busy at all. Still tried to make the best of it and enjoy the company of my girls. We are and our drinks were low... after our food she never came to check on us. None of us noticed the bill she placed in the middle of the table. She never asked how we want it split. So we figure when she comes back, we can ask. Again she got by us and by the time she came back our 4 credit cards were already charged. I asked, how did she decide to split the bill? She replied, \"Equally.\" I asked her why didn't she bother to ask? No response, so I did mention, in the future please check with your table and ask how they want it split. (This isn't something I should tell her) Day 2.. today. I decided to go back and redo this experience with my fiance. As he has never been. We head in and ask if I can have the same spot yesterday. One server said yes and the assistant manager said no. I had my receipt to show her that we were just here yesterday and sat at that exact table. Her response, \"The general manager was here when you guys were here so that's why you were able to sit there.\" My thoughts... of the GM approves us sitting there, and she was only the assistant... why couldn't we sit there? We showed up same time. Today was far more dead than yesterday. Literally a total of 3 groups of a small party seated outside. I could understand if it's packed busy and they had to designate a spot. Anyway 2 days consecutive of shit service was enough.",

    "text": "To start off, my wife came here with a girlfriend weeks ago and liked the food so much that she wanted to bring me back to try it. We were excited. We had lunch around 2pm and was greeted and seated instantly. Within minutes a busser dropped fresh bread and butter and took our drink orders. Being that it was the end of April, it's starting to get hot outside but the inside where we were seated was freezing so if you hate being cold you wouldn't have enjoyed it. After about fifteen minutes our waiter came and asked us for our order in a very hasty way to make us feel like hurry up, I have things to do. The food came out quick and it wasn't bad, not good, but not $50 worth of quality (Olive Garden is 10 times better if you get the idea) since it was so cold I tried to see if we were seated next to the vents and when I looked up, I could see the vents caked with dirt and dust. These vents are on the expediting line right above the kitchen so you'll be eating that. I looked to the ledge that separated our table booth from the kitchen and I took a picture of a thick layer of dirt at my eye level. I could only imagine the amount of dust and dirt that made its way into my food. Won't be going back anytime soon. (The napkin is what I used to clean some of the table while we were eating)  UPDATE: They reached out to me after this review stating they were concerned about my experience and wanted to speak with me. I gave my contact information and never heard a word. Hopefully they take a real hard look at their standards. This review wasn't to bash a company or restaurant but to make the guest experience better for future customers.",

I felt like our server was getting irritated a couple times but then he would snap out of it. I get they were super busy so I just let it slide.

First, Brio is probably 3 dollar signs, pushing four. Our bill came to $175 without desert and portions did not leave us with leftovers. But we did get two amazing appetizers and three drinks. Price aside Brio is very nice inside. It looks a lot like Cheesecake Factory with one difference- an artsy Roman Coliseum replica stretching to the ceiling. With the high, hard ceiling came a lot of echoey noisy cafeteria chatter. Not a quiet dining experience like one of my favorite places, Don Vito at the Southpoint. However the food at Brio is very good. Try the shrimp and eggplant appetizer or the Calamari. Fantastic taste, not overly salty, and good spicy flavor but not too spicy. I had the mushroom ravioli and loved it. The steak and lamb chops were good. The lamb chops were a little fatty and my wife left enough that the server asked if she wanted a take home box. The penne vodka was fantastic, the pasta was clearly made fresh. The service was fantastic which is a really nice treat considering service in Las Vegas can be very spotty. Our server was on top of everything and is what pushed this review to four stars. Is Brio better than a Carrabbas or family owned Sicilian, or Don Vito's? I'd bring family and friends to any and all. It beats (insult to Italians) Olive Garden, Buca, and dingy Bootlegger so we will be back. Sorry for no pics. The food was really good and we were hungry!",

    "text": "I have always had good luck at Brio in Town Square for lunch, Happy Hour, and dinner.  Service is always good and the food and drinks are well made and full-flavored.  If you like Brio, I reccomend joining the MyBRIO REWARDS club.  You get a free meal on your birthday and various discount offers throughout the year.  This trip we came for lunch to try the new Lighter Side Menu.  About a 5 minute wait...not bad for lunch time.  Our server arrived right after we were seated for our drink order.  She was very attentive and super sweet.  I wish I remembered her name!    I had the 5 oz Filet Brio with asparagus, cubed sweet potatoes, spinach, and roasted red peppers.  $19.95 and 365 cals.  It definitely tasted better than 365 calories...and was more filling as well!  The filet was cooked to a perfect medium rare, juicy and savory.  The portion size was just enough to share a few bites with my friend without feeling like I needed more.  For some reason I was expecting mashed sweet potatoes, but they were tiny roasted cubes and were delicious.  The asparagus, spinach, and red peppers were also prepared superbly.  All the ingredients complemented each other and the meal was delightful.  I will definitely get this again.  The price point seemed a couple dollars too high for lunch, but the meat quality was very good, so I cannot complain.  My friend had the Shrimp Mediterranean, also from the Lighter Side Menu.  $14.95/ 470 cals. It came with orzo & farro pilaf, feta, broccoli, spinach, and asparagus.  She let me sample her dish; it was very tasty and something I would order if I was not super hungry.  I think mine was more filling because of my protein choice.  All in all, another good Brio meal!",

I came here once with my bff and twice with chris before his bball games (he likes to have a big plate of pastas first for energy)  I always have smaller plates from the low carb menu, My favorites are so far: beef carpaccio, lobster bisque, shrimp Mediterranean on orzo and spinach bed and mini creme brulee served in espresso cup! The tiramisu is very good too, it's my friend's favorite! The shrimptini is just ok, the shrimps were small and a bit watery but the shrimps from the entrees are huge, nicely grilled and delicious.  The service was always great except one time when our waitress never refilled our iced teas until we asked for it again and again... Then had our refill finally when we paid our bill. Not cool. I am not asking for extra attention,  just for drink/water during my meal.  The service the other times was perfectly on point and everybody else was very friendly.  So we will come back tomorrow night for sure and I will make sure to update my review by then.",

What I have found most impressive is their $5 martinis on Thursdays during happy hour. All of the martinis I have sampled have been absolutely delicious. And for $5, well, you just can't beat that.",

After being seated, we waited 10 minutes and no one came by our table. After waving down a server not assigned to our table, we finally got water. After our appetizer came out, the runner took back one of the app plates to return with a different plate (that wasn't wet or dirty or something), but despite passing our table 5 more times, he never returned.  Our waiter never came back by the table to check up, refill water or bread. He only came by after we commented to another waiter, twice, to ask my girlfriend if she wanted more alcohol... \"No thanks, buddy, I'm good on water over here.\"  The food was still delicious, but we won't come back without making sure we get seated in Phillip's section. The service manager was so kind to comp our meal this time, which is what will keep us coming back - an appreciation for customer service. Ultimately, this is still a great restaurant with amazing food and typically excellent service.",

The second time I went there I went with my boyfriend. We went on a thursday. Also went there for happy hour. When we sat down, I noticed a $5 martinis only on thursdays.   The price for the happy hour food is $3.95 for every single plate on the happy hour menu.  The service is good. But the first time I went there, it was ok.

I must say the Bellini was ok but just ok it was really sweet and thick and kind of hard to choke down. The mojito on the other hand was freaking delicious I really recommend trying the mojito it was refreshing and had a nice fruit flavor with not to much mint.   For the entree I got fettuccine Alfredo cuz I'm kinda picky and it is my favorite pasta dish ever!! It was so yummy! It was rich and the pasta was cooked perfect and of course I got extra cheese. It was very filling and the portion sizes were on point.   We didn't opt for dessert because we were so full it was ridiculous but the dessert menu did sound really good and I definitely want to try one next time we go.   The decor is really nice and the service was great we never didn't have bread which is pretty damn awesome cuz you gotta always have bread with Italian food. I highly recommend this restaurant for an intimate date night or an anniversary it was amazing and my only complaint is I wish the Bellini wasn't so sweet! A+ Brio",

I had a strawberry lemonade and as far as happy hour food goes I had the spicy shrimp and eggplant, beef carpaccio, and shrimptini.    The spicy shrimp and eggplant wasn't that spicy, it was perfect.  The sauce was great, if I was at olive garden I would grab a garlic bread and wipe the plant clean.  The beef carpaccio was delightful.  I wanted to chew on the beef like a piece of bubble gum until the flavor ran out.  The salad had just the right amount of dressing.  The shrimptini is your regular shrimp in a martini glass.  The happy hour goes:  Monday - Friday from 3:30pm-6:30pm & Monday-Thursday 9pm-Close.  Stop by, if you can find a seat, and enjoy a quick snack while you shop around!",

Love the option to sit at the bar inside or out!  3.95 for a wonderfully cooked burger?!! My husband loves the carpaccio, be sure to ask for extra sauce. They used to have a steak brushetta with Gorgonzola on the happy hour menu, I am sad its gone but they still have great selections, like my favorite spicy shrimp and eggplant, again ask for extra sauce.   You can get a cocktail for 5 dollars as well! We usually stick to the martini, but have tried a few of there specialty cocktails and they were all good. We usually sit at the bar close to Del Mar, he is so awesome! He's busy and still manages to make us perfect drinks, he is always attentive and smiling and always gives outstanding service!!

Hit the spot!  Nice little portions, perfect for splitting.  We agreed ordering 1 or 2 more would've made for a filling meal.    We both really enjoyed the food and portion sizes.  However, our favorite part of coming here was the service!  You have to sit in the bar or outside on the couches to order the tasters menu.  We sat at the bar and actually had 3 different bartenders waiting on us!  Each was more pleasant than the next!  Very nice to have attentive service!

    "text": "From my first visit in 2008 to many, many visits in the last five years, I have enjoyed EVERY meal and experience. Perfect for an intimate evening with your beau, a light lunch with your shopping partner, or a celebratory meal with a group.  Having dined here so often, there are few dishes I haven't tried. These are my favorite that are classics and, unfortunately, some items that have since been removed from the menu (seasonal, making room for new dishes): CALAMARI FRITTO MISTO: It's no surprise that I love calamari and it's one of my *benchmark* dishes to try at new restaurants. I like their batter, the lightly-battered peperoncini that creates a nice, refreshing note, and their delicious marinara for dipping. I do not like the creamy sauce (not really sure what it is) that is also served. LOBSTER BISQUE: This is definitely one of the best lobster bisques (or bisques in general) that I have eaten. Nice pieces of lobster and this version is finished with a touch of sherry. Delicious. BTW, the cup is enough; trust me, don't go for the bowl unless that is all you're planning to eat. POLLO AL FORNO FLATBREAD: Grilled chicken, tomatoes, bacon, feta cheese, green onions with a tomato sauce and creamy parmesan. SERIOUS YUM. The bread is the perfect thickness, creating the right vehicle for this delicious medley of ingredients. Sadly, this is no longer on the Vegas menu! CHICKEN MILANESE: Romano breaded chicken with herb spaghetti served in my favorite sauce - pomodoro. The breading is crispy without overwhelming the dish and I love their interpretation of the pomodoro. CHICKEN LIMONE: PIccata-style chicken with a blend of lemon, capers, and white wine - another preparation I really enjoy. The chicken breast is always juicy and the sauce is tangy. They used to serve it with their cripsy potatoes (large chucks of well-fried/sauteed potatoes with herbs and peppers - think \"Potatoes O'Brien\"), which I really liked.  There are many salads, appetizers, pastas, flatbread, and bruschetta that they offer, I've eaten, and have enjoyed very much. You can't go wrong! The only dish that was less than satisfactory was the Sweet Potato and Chicken Risotto; bleh.  This year, they introduced \"The Lighter Side of Tuscany\" with menu items that have reduced calories (I believe they are all below a certain amount, say 600). I tried the INSALATA BRIO: Mixed greens, roasted red peppers, grilled asparagus, tomatoes, grapes and candied pecans tossed with an Italian vinaigrette and balsamic drizzle. Just 345 calories! Well, I removed the gorgonzola and asked for the dressings on the side, so that I could get it as \"Vegan\" as possible. Very delicious!  They have a specials menu that is updated daily, so make sure to check it out because their seasonal cocktails are certainly worthwhile. Some of my favorites that were offered in the past (and I believe one may have become a permanent menu offering) are the STRAWBERRY BASIL LIMONATA (Muddled strawberries and basil in a limonata, so refreshing and yummy) and the APPLE CIDER MARTINI (A little brandy, apple cider, spiced rum, lemon juice, rimmed with cinnamon, YUMMM). I've recreated both cocktails at home and it has consistently been a crowd-pleaser.",

    "text": "Brio's Birthday Deal: My son chose to spend his 15th birthday dinner here on Monday night.  We (son, his father, and I) arrived at 6:00pm and the patio area was packed when we walked by, but we were promptly seated inside at a spacious booth.  I told the hostess that we were celebrating the teenager's birthday and her immediate reaction was, \"Oh, you didn't tell us at the front--let me get his birthday card!\"  What?  So, she came right back with a birthday card that was obviously pre-handwritten for such occasions, but it did include a coupon for a free appetizer on our next visit--nice touch.  The kind lady also informed us that the birthday boy was also going to get a free dessert of his choosing with a lit candle, but that there would be no singing--yay!  My son picked the perfect place for his birthday!  We've been to Brio several times and this is one of the reasons--they give great customer service.  Our waitress was attentive, we always had plenty of bread and drink refills, and were satisfied with our dishes:  Chicken Under the Brick, Sweet Potato and Chicken Risotto, and Grilled Shrimp & Orzo.  The kid chose the Chocolate Lava cake and free dessert is always delicious!  If you want to get the most for your money on your birthday, check out Brio:  great food, fantastic service, and freebies!",

I sat there with no drink refill for 45 minutes. We literally never saw our waitress after she delivered our drinks (meals are brought by other staff). I had to ask another waiter for our check and he tell us \"sorry I'm not your waiter\". He gets our waiter and she brings the check over. I put my credit card in it and leave it on the table. 20 minutes go by and she still doesn't take it!!! Rediculous!  Did I leave a tip... yes I did... $0.01. That's right I left a 1 cent tip because that's all this waitress deserved!",

    "text": "Happened to walk by and thought this must be the place our cousin was raving about.  So, I took a chance there might be a table and lucky for us, we didnt need a reservation.  We got there early around 5 pm.  We were immediately seated, and our server Dino was awesome.  He gave us great recommendations like the Pasta Alla Vodka and I also had the insalata on the side.   The bread basket kept getting refilled and the timing was perfect.  Our son absolutely loved the bread.   I think it was a mild sourdough? Whatever it was, it was soft and delicious.   Our salads arrived and they were entree sized.   I tasted hubby's Caesar which had great  garlic flavor! My wedge salad with goat cheese and parmesan dressing was EXCELLENT!  There was just enough dressing and flavoring,  but it was not excessive.  Plus, I was expecting a small salad but this was substantial and I had no trouble finishing it. My son's \"mac and cheese\" arrived and he proclaimed it to be \"SO GOOD.\"  Rarely have we heard our picky son rave about any food.  My pasta alla vodka consisted of heavenly pillows of dough filled with ricotta in a dreamy \"rosetta\" sauce.  I had chicken added for a few bucks more.  I took a taste of hubby's angel hair pasta with shrimp which had a nice lemony flavor.   Our server Dino was great.  He anticipated our needs and was at our table at just the right time.  None of that annoying repetitious \"Is your food ok?\" before you even had a taste of it.  My ice tea was refilled without having to ask.  Another note, the venue is absolutely beautiful and classy in a warm Tuscany style.  It was not ostentatious at all and there's outdoor seating which on a cooler day would have been ideal.   However, it was over 100 degrees, so we wisely chose to eat inside.  Since we were too full, we got a preview of the dessert tray for our next visit to Brio, the next time we're in Vegas.  Next time, I'll definitely save room for dessert.  There were individual servings in cute miniature containers, so we're not obligated to have to share large desserts.  This place seems to appeal to everyone from the executive, families, girlfriends going out, dinner dates....etc. Apparently, there are many Brios in many cities.  Too bad there isnt a Brio in the South Bay area!",

The decor is beautiful and the service was above and beyond. As I mentioned earlier, I had a last minute event. I made my reservation for Sunday Brunch during Thanksgiving weekend. It was part of wedding festivities. They were so nice to let me in a bit early to have the table set so that all of my guests would feel like guests. This is what we ordered.   Appetizers:  Fried calamari and flatbread BBQ chicken pizza   Entrees (everyone was pleased)  Penne w/Vodka sauce, carbonara, fettuccine rustica, paninis, risotto and some brunch items   Coffee service:  Cappuccino and coffee for dessert.   Gluten Free:  As I was ordering, I mentioned no croutons with my salad ..can't have gluten. Server asked if I had an allergy, I said yes. They made all the adjustments to accommodate my dietary restrictions. There is a whole protocol that goes into effect to limit cross contamination. Awesome. I'm not as sensitive, but those with allergies should feel confident that they have a knowledgeable staff. I do have to mention that initially I asked the hostess and she said no they do not have GF options/choices. They clearly do. So happy that my waiter(s) and kitchen are informed about food allergies. Our waiters were Ryan and Dino.",

I let him know about the new order and he went and brought it over.  overall food was okay but service  was not. server was only at table 4 times including he never checked back to see if we were okay. a man could of been manager only stopped by once to see if second order was okay. I am sure based on business maybe server had off day as the alternative  would be he was not good at his job.",

Whenever I have guests in town I bring them here.   This time was no different. I've called 15 minutes in advance to make sure we get seated and in fact we were seated right away upon arrival.  Chilly weather calls for a bowl of hot soup and Brio's lobster bisque was an excellent starter. Carpacchio as usual, Burger (perfectly medium-rare), Crab cakes and Fritatta for me... all with a glass of Chianti.  We were in and out literally in 30 minutes. Service was timely and attentive. Brio really feels like a well-oiled restaurant machine :)",

I have been planning my Vegas wedding since February and was having a hard time finding a place that was elegant with excellent food without breaking the bank. Nova is the banquet manager there and he was truly amazing. He addressed my one million emails prior to the dinner and was a True advocate for helping me have an outstanding dinner even when I lived in another state. It was stressful being so far away but Nova made it easy for me.   Let's start with the food. I had visited the restaurant before I signed a contract to try the food. The chicken milanese was great but the real highlights were the filet  and also the pasta with vodka sauce. The pasta was handmade and to die for. We were also served two types of salad and potatoes/veggies. Everything was great but my wedding group raved about the filet for days. Who would have thought you could get such a great steak at an Italian restaurant.   The service was great. Tamara was fun and very concerned about making sure I was a happy bride. I paid for a bar package and was not disappointed. The staff was very attentive and took multiple drink orders. I definitely felt that we got more than what we paid for. The servers also cut and served our cake that we had ordered.   Overall it was a fantastic experience and I am sure that we will go back each time we visit  Vegas to relive the memory. Thank you so much Nova and Brio Tuscan for making my wedding so memorable.",

And there definitely are points that embrace the chain restaurant blandness (atmosphere), but thankfully, the food is done well.

While the frutti was not as good as Mezzo's take on the dish, it still held up and was satisfying. Our service was adequate and friendly.

I was part of a fairly large group. We came in on a Thursday evening for the happy hour menu. The prices were obviously great but keep in mind it is a $3 happy hour menu so don't expect too much! The presentation of the food is awesome, but I cant say the same for the flavor. I ordered the Margareta flat bread, it came out little cold and tasted like tomatoes on matzah. Martinis were $5 which is a good price. I tried the Razzbertini and the Lemon basil. Razzbertini was OK nothing special, however, the lemon basil was delicious! very refreshing.   I guess we were sitting by a \"break\" area for the employees. I'm not sure if it was a break area or a little corner they hide at outside and shoot the sh** with each other. Definitely should think about hiring a little bit more mature staff!",

The service was excellent.  Crystal was our catering coordinator who was great to work with leading up to the event.  Michael, the manager, was also super friendly.

    "text": "My most recent visit was not my first visit. Actually, it is among quite the few. Brio has been a pretty good go-to restaurant for a nice sit down dinner with a variety of meat or pasta choices.   I was introduced to Brio about 5 years ago. And it has yet to completely fail me. Even with a recent experience of not mine, but two of my friend's Rack of Lamb order, they had messed up the temperature on the meat twice. One returned to the waiter, second time, even the manager and chef had come out. GREAT service and customer satisfaction.   My most recent visit was for a friend's graduation party. She had made reservations a day prior. Upon arrival, took maybe 10 minutes from arrival to having table ready. Not bad? Had came here for my b-day as well last august, and it took about the same amount of time for getting table ready.   We were seated in the back room (first time sitting in that room) in a 7 person round table.   At first, service was pretty good. Quick for drink orders and first round of bread came pretty fast. But went downhill from there. I had asked the waitress for more bread. My friend had asked another person for more bread. Because we had 7 people, the first round's two bread baskets disappeared fairly quick. Let's say, all our entrees came out, and was more than 1/2 way through it before one new basket of bread came out. Could easily say it was at least 30 minutes. This was just bread. If the bread is being baked or not ready, at least tell us ! The bread was good too ! first round of bread, nice and hot. i wanted more ! *sad face*   I had ordered the Bistecca Alla Fiorentina (14 oz. Strip Steak served with mashed potatoes and roasted vegetables) - $28.45 - Seasoned well. Meat temperature was perfectly medium rare, like i had ordered. Mashed potatoes were creamy and rich. Roasted vegetables were... well... roasted vegetables. Lol. The one thing i dont understand about restaurants is why do they insist on using serrated steak knives? Not only do they rip through the meat, requires extra force to hold down the meat so it wont move while the serrated edge rips through..... Im not sure if its a safety thing or what... id much prefer a sharp non-serrated knife that allows me to cut through cleanly. Even if the meat quality is low and not cut through like butter, it still wont rip through... just make me make a few more passes before it cuts through.. personal little irk that bothers me i guess.   One of my friends had ordered the Brio Sliced Steak Salad (Mixed greens, tomatoes, Gorgonzola, mushrooms, candied pecans and creamy horseradish dressing, topped with grilled tenderloin and a balsamic glaze) - $15.95 - chopped greens topped with a tenderloin. Salad itself looked good and wonderfully dressed. The amount of meat she got was very little. I dont know if it really is a tenderloin but dang... i'd estimate the amount of meat that was there to be maybe 3 - 4 oz. For such a big salad, it was quite... tiny   In previous visits, i have tried the Gorgonzola Crusted Bistecca as well as the Roasted Lamb Chops.   Gorgonzola Crusted Bistecca - (Perfectly seasoned topped with Gorgonzola. Served with mashed potatoes and roasted vegetables.) 8oz filet $29.95, 14oz strip $28.95 - essentially the same as the above listed Bistecca Alla Fiorentina but topped with a gorgonzola crust. Adds a nice flavor but the seasoning on the crust plus possible seasoning on the steak may double up and be a bit salty.   Roasted Lamb Chops (Full rack, perfectly seasoned New Zealand lamb chops, with red wine veal sauce, mashed potatoes and grilled asparagus) - $29.45 - when done right, perfectly cooked and seasoned. tender and juicy. you get i believe 5-6 lamb chops. decent size. great for lamb lovers who may not want a steak. good alternative.   Overall, despite the occassional lack of service, its still a favorite place to go among myself and some friends.",

No matter how you put it it's a nice place to dine weather you're here for a work gathering or dinner for 2 it's perfect and their food is great.   I was here recently for my father in laws big 5 oh and we had our party in their small banquet room. I've been in this room before for his parents 50th anniversary and it works for a small private group. The service here is awesome and the staff is really accommodating as far as cakes, flowers, decor and slide show goes.   The food and drinks are always good as expected. We had at this party a four coarse meal. Staring off with 2 choice of salad an Italian chop and a Cesar's wedge with bacon yum! Then we were served the apps calamari and something else I can't remember but their calamari are battered and delicious crispy enough and had great seasoning paired with marinara dipping sauce. The family style entrees were lemon chicken with capers or something like that, steak and this very good cheese tortellini  Pasta dish. All this and bread and butter as well.   As usual all the food maws very good and the dessert (2 options) tiramisu and cheese cake were really yummy and presented really nice...not pictured boo. But regardless Brio is always a nice place to dine and the food is always satisfying!",

I hadn't been in a while so i was really looking forward to getting my burrata and tomato appetizer and shrimp Mediterranean entree. I went tonight with my boyfriend only to discover that the entire menu had changed - nothing i recognized was on there anymore and when i asked our server what happened to everything he said the owners changed and i guess with that the menu? Don't get me wrong, there are still a few decent things to choose from (chicken and salmon) but not like before. I swear the menu was cut in half and the appetizers absolutely suck now. So this already bummed me out but on top of that, the service was horrendous. It took a while just to get some waters and much longer than necessary before i got the glass of wine i ordered. Our food took forever as well, and i just feel our server wasn't attentive. I'm sad to say i don't think I'll be coming back to brio after tonight :( the slow service i can deal with, but the menu change ? Ugh.",

We ordered the Bruschetta sampler which was good wish the steak was more tender. We also got the Brio chopped salad it was also good needed more veggies in my opinion but it was satisfactory. Now what I was most excited about was the prosciutto and Burrata pizza I wasn't disappointed it was good but after I got it immediately wanted the crust to be thinner maybe next time overall it turned out to be a nice time waster and the company was awesome. The staff are nice also they put us out of the way of the other people we also had our giant twin stroller so they do accommodate strollers even at lunch go figure.",

They stepped on my foot as they were doing and didn't apologize. Just laughed and said oh excuse me.

They have a variety of choices on the menu to choose from and the price is very reasonable. My friend had the pasta brio with Alfredo sauce. I  went more traditional and ordered the Americana burger.

I still give it 5 stars for my servers always being pleasant, helpful and friendly and because the food has always been on point.",

The service here is decent. Nothing they did really stood out. As a matter of fact, they tried to give us someone else's order. We also had to ask a few times for our check.

Based on their menu, there's enough of a selection for everyone.    There's even a \"Lighter Side Menu\", which I chose to partake in. Lighter side choices range from lean steaks, chicken, salmon, salads, and some white fish (i.e. Mahi Mahi and Tilapia). Of course, I went with their 5 oz Filet Brio.  This was served with asparagus and sweet potato.  You can't go wrong with grilled asparagus and their sweet potato was amazing.  My only issue with both...wish I had more.  As for their 5 oz filet, I had this cooked medium-well.  In the last 2 weeks I've had steak at least 3 other times at well respected steakhouses.  No joke...I think Brio's was up there in tenderness, taste, and presentation.  My entree was less than 400 calories and a little over $20.  Bang for your buck without a bang on your nutrition!  The ambiance was great. You gotta love the tall ceilings.  Our server was great as well. I know that this is an Italian restaurant and I didn't get anything Italian.  But their steaks are good and for that alone, I am a fan.    YELP PERSONAL CHALLENGE 2013 - (485/500)",

The HALF BURRATA & PROSCIUTTO SANDWICH that tasted as if tapioca had a kid. The complete lack of flavor made it a sad meal. To make the box more appealing baked crisps were put in. A solid challenge for even to eat even one. They have made items that can be used in construction. NEVER AGAIN!!!",

The server seemed baffled by our request, after he left us alone for 15 minutes without speaking to us - no drinks, no bread, didn't take our entree order - nothing. Then he did bring our iced tea - after we asked three times - with no lemon, no straws. Just clueless! I asked for a manager and requested a new server, who is doing better but we shouldn't have to get a manager's assistance to get drinks. The manager has been very gracious. As for the food? I have no idea because now it's been almost 40 minutes and I still haven't gotten my appetizer salad. Just ... So disappointed. Maybe starting someone new on the Saturday of a holiday weekend isn't the best idea. Just a thought.  Update: We never got our appetizer salads. Frankly, I don't think the server ever submitted our order. Then my brother's order of stuffed pasta with vodka sauce  came out cold. We had to ask three times for olive oil and balsamic vinegar. The food was good, especially the bread, but I couldn't get over the poor service, even after TWO managers got involved. Ultimately we were comped our meal, partly so I would \"stop yelling.\" (My voice was raised but I didn't think I was yelling.) The sous chef was very nice. And we did leave a tip for the full cost of the meal. I won't be returning.",

You're a class act Brio's, own up to a bad review once in awhile.  I love Brio's in Town Square. My husband and I take out of town friends whenever someone visits. It's always part of the Las Vegas experience we love to share. We took a very dear friend tonight who is visiting From New Jersey. She's waited for years to go. As always, the food was great. However, our server was lousy. First time ever! We had to ask someone else to bring parmesan, a little extra sauce for my crab cakes, my husband sat for 15 minutes with an empty wine glass...we were told she had 'other customers'. It was 4 pm..not busy. She just wasn't good. First time I ever saw my husband leave a 10% tip. Such a disappointment from a place we love so much.\":",

That being said, I was ultimately surprised when our waitress in the bar section was a little too sarcastic or trying too hard to be nice, like it was physically hurting her to do so... She explained our menus like we looked confused as to what she even had handed us.  I was turned off immediately by how apathetic she was being.  We were done with our meal and two other waiters asked us if we wanted the bill.  15 mins go by, four servers stood by the checkout while we painstakingly waited at our table.  We honestly could have just got up and walked out with no discrepancies...  Also I bartend, my fiance is a competitive bartender as well so we know professionalism.  A older bartender got woodford reserve out and left it on the bar for 5mins... He free handed the sketchiest old fashioned I've ever seen... And then did not put the bottle back in its place.  The second bartender came around and poured water yet did nothing about the bottle that was still out.  The original tender passed it four more times without putting it back.  He also proceeded to stick an unopened straw into a shot he poured but had found something in the drink that wasn't supposed to be there. It was an unpleasant experience.",

    "text": "We have been to Brio several times with the kids and I am been to Brio soooo many times on my own.  And here is a hint, take the kids with you and share the food that is served for the kids.  The portions are huge for children and half the price of adult entrees.  While my husband and I did not do this the two times we have taken the kids, we keep joking that \"next time\" we are going to do just that!  The food is consistent.  I typically hate chain restaurants, but I will make a slight exception for Brio, if I am craving the lobster bisque.",

    "text": "Wow! What a menu! Decisions, desicions.  I ordered the Shrimp and Scallops Fettucini and it was very wonderful. The staff was very friendly and refilled the table's sodas without having to be asked.  The decor was beautiful with fabric running from wall to wall. I am assuming that this would be a good place to have a group gathering as it looked like in the back there was a seperate room available for these functions.  If I am ever in the area again I will try to come back.",

    "text": "The experience was a bit rocky.  It was nice to see the place so busy on a late Wednesday night however, it seemed to me no one was communicating.  When we arrived, they told me it would be 10 minute wait.  We waited more like 20 minutes before getting seated which is ok but we had asked for a booth and they tried to seat us at  a round set for 6 when there was two of us in the party.  Directly across from the table was a dirty booth.   After being sat, 10 minutes go by with no sign of service.  When we did finally get someone to the table, he dropped of bread and left without one word.  We watched server after server walk by without anyone coming over.   A table that sat down after us (across from us) got service well before us.  It had to be at least 15 minutes until our waiter arrived.  Once he got there, he apologized for the wait.  It was smooth sailing from there.  For a chain restaurant, the food was good.  The Harvest Salad had great flavors however, needed more cheese.   I think I will sit at the bar next time.  May be the service there will be better.",

I try and sneak a couple bites of my friends food, so far I've tried the lasagna, shrimp risotto, both have been excellent. The bruschetta is the best in town. And the outside seating with fire pits puts this place on my number one list to eat at when I'm at town square. This is a pretty good spot for a chain restaurant.",

    "text": "Las Vegas is not a walking city.  The hotels are far apart.  The suburbs have strip malls.  The heat in summer (and the cold in winter) makes much of the year unpleasant outdoors.  But in the spring and fall we can have some absolutely gorgeous days.  Last night was a beautiful warm spring evening.  It was not windy and the clouds overhead were spectacular.  This was the perfect time for dining al fresco and what better meal to have than something Italian.  A friend of ours who works at UNLV suggested this new restaurant in Town Square.  Although we have been to Town Square several times (and visit Fry's next door regularly), we had not tried this restaurant.  We were seated on the outdoor patio promptly and ordered the carpaccio which was recommended by our friend.  I'm glad we did as it was delicious.  I decided on the lobster risotto and my husband had the Veal Milanese both accompanied by a lovely Italian white wine.  There was plenty of lobster and asparagus in my risotto.  My husband's veal was tender with just enough capers and lemon butter to flavor it, but not to make it soggy.  I am not much of a dessert person, so we skipped it.  Sipping the last of our wine while the the sky grew dark was the perfect end to a beautiful day.  We will be back.",

Only con for me is that the happy hour menu is pretty limited and anything that is not on happy hour menu is a little pricier than I'd like. I would definitely keep going back for happy hour!!",

    "text": "This is a solid restaurant.   I've been to a location in Orlando, and now the one in Las Vegas. Every time the food has been consistent, flavorful, and served hot. This particular location has paid close attention to the aesthetics, which from a designer's point of view is always appreciated.   More important however, when considering any restaurant with multiple locations and above-average prices is the food and service. Again, I have yet to be disappointed. Considering the brusque treatment I got at the Grotto in the Golden Nugget, I was afraid that might be par for the course. Thankfully it isnt.   Brio's Vegas location in a walking mall is a nice change from the more parking lot-oriented locations in other states. Its nice to be on a patio that isnt overlooking only cars but real pedestrians going about their business.   For a nice bite of Italian close to McCarran, Brio's Las Vegas location gets my nod.",

I would say that their pastas are on the same taste level as cheesecake factory, around the same price but LESS then half the portion as cheesecake factory pasta portions. I normally like to take extra food home and I cant do that at Brio because their pasta portions are only enough for one sitting. very nice environment . Decent customer service , Always come here for a quick bite.",
