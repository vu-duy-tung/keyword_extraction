    "text": "Today was pretty busy with a line at 6:30pm.  FYI - My folks tell me it's because Gold Coast gives more comps away on Tuesdays and Wednesdays.  Not long after we were seated, our drink order was taken and then moments later our order.  The food is served family style and comes out when it's ready (which typically doesn't take long.)  Today we ordered lobster ($70), Cantonese Princess Chicken ($14.95), XO green string beans add cod fish ($16.95 - they charge $3 for XO and $5 for the fish), spinach with fermented bean curd ($8.95), and live scallops ($8).   The lobster was delicious and fresh cooked hong kong style which is sauteed in a ginger scallion sauce chopped in pieces you can easily remove it's shell.  (Pic added) They don't charge by the pound which is weird.  They just charge one flat rate cost.  This lobster was a good two pounds.  Delicious.  Traditional Chinese restaurants will serve their food whole - meaning everything from the head to the tail.  It's considered bad luck to not serve it whole.  This whole chicken is served cold which throws people off.  My friends have told me they'd like it more if it was served hot.  It comes with dried scallops and a ginger and oil dipping sauce which I find myself dunking my chicken in and mixing it with rice.  Yum.  The green string beans is alone $8.25, but I love XO sauce and to add some fresh cod to it was a no-brainer.  This was cooked to perfection with the green beans crisp and the fish was fresh and delicate texture. (Pic added)  The spinach was low in flavor for me.  My folks liked it but they would eat spinach simply steamed.  The spinach itself was fresh, they just didn't add enough \"foo yee\" and when I asked for extra (pic added) and when I tried to mix it with the spinach something wasn't right.  It's unfortunate as you can't reheat spinach very well so the left overs were wasted.  The live scallop comes on a shell with rice noodles.  It's a small portion of two pieces for $8.  My mom likes it but I've had better.  They also have razor clams for $10 for 4 pieces cooked in black bean sauce.  I was first introduced this gem in Hong Kong and the flavor is close here but I shouldn't really compare it when they literally just pulled it out of the water hours ago in HK.  Other items I would recommend is their ma po tofu, gobo beef, lamb with scallions, walnut prawns, and their singapore noodle but add extra curry.  They usually have a house soup they provide complimentary but they didn't today - or maybe we just didn't ask for it.  Sadly, if it wasn't that we come here so often and they know my parents, I think we wouldn't have such great service.  I feel for the people that have to keep flagging down their server or constantly have to ask for more tea or napkins.  I do believe the servers and busboys are trying - I think it's just engrained in our old school culture that this is the way it's suppose to be. sigh.",

We visited Chinatown and this restaurant was recommended by a couple of ladies working in one of the stores. One of the ladies said the food is very fresh because it turns over quickly, unlike the restaurants in Chinatown. I do like fried rice and I ordered mine with shrimp and pork. It was actually very well made and delicious. We couldn't take leftovers home because we were traveling but I surprised myself and actually ate the whole thing! My boyfriend had fish rice soup and some other entrees and enjoyed it all.",

Ping Pang Pong is in the Gold Coast casino so can use Boyd comps and points, which is a real plus.  The dim sum we tried, mostly picked by Jane K., were really good.  Not sure if hot mustard (standard in Hawaii) is available but most diners were using chili sauce instead.",

Not too keen on the chicken feet but the rest was very good.  In addition we ordered a Dungeness Crab dish.  Deep fried crab was a first for me and it was very good.  The red peppers on top were hot!  Service was great and we were seated within 5 minutes of arrival.  I have only been there once but heard it was recently renovated.  It looked very nice and had dividers between side tables giving you a chance to talk without being heard by other guests.  Try it!",

The only thing is if you want white rice, it's extra 0.75 cents. Other than that, food was awesome! Will absolutely come back to try other dishes soon!",

First of all.... it is inside the Gold Coast Resort....one of those festive place this the locals frequent. So much more exciting as you face the casino floor. Who wouldn't LOVE that?  Dim Sum is just served at lunch and I arrived two hours early. It waa full but not crowded.  This was the best part.... limited cart service that day ONLY. Poor pitiful little me had to only order the dim sum favorites I live for!  , hicken feet were the largest I had ever enjoyed! I poued the fatty juices over the sticky rice from the THREE huge banana leaf rolls.  The braised oxtails were almost bone free and fork tender. Honestly.... each of the 15 or so man hunks waa almost two inches across.  I wrapped up this unforgettable feast with the mango puddig. Not overly sweet and mouthfulls of tropical flavour.  I can not wait to get back in February!",

Open late hours so when I've come here it has usually been on the later end of the evening. They pretty much have a very traditional Chinese dining menu, but a small bowl of white steamed rice is 50cents which I was surprised with all the entrees we were ordering we were not getting a free bowl of white rice.   Tonight we had the Kung Pao Chicken, Dry Beef Chow Fun, Salt and Pepper Pork, BBQ Pork Fried Rice, Gobo Beef, and seafood mixed Soft Noodles which probably is their fancy name version of lo mein. All the food actually was pretty good.  Kung Pao Chicken - I enjoyed how tender the chicken slices were, and the sauce for this particular dish was just right, right amount of spicy and right amount of sweetness to it.   Gobo Beef - probably my new favorite dish to order when coming to this restaurant. Small thick cut cubes of beef sirloin, every flavorful and savory taste of beef cubes. could be more on the tender side, but otherwise very tasty.  Beef Chow Fun - average tasting chow fun, a little on the oily side for my liking, but chow fun is my all time favorite chinese food dish, so I normally will order this entree at any chinese restaurant i'm eating at.   BBQ Pork fried rice - it was a little on the dry side for me, but I guess it's better to be dry than oily. nothing unique or special, pretty standard dish for fried rice  Salt and Pepper pork - a little too much on the salty side  seafood Mixed soft noodles - this name of the entree to me is in no doubt that it's their fancy name for lo mein, very standard display and style of cooking for the seafood lo mein look-alike,   their hot tea was very very good, but their service overall sucked and some people (the hostess) really have terrible and rude attitudes and I know the customer can sense and see it. slow service, and just overall even if they are understaffed, they dont have to be sour faced or rude about it.   3/5 for pretty standard okay food and terrible service :/",

I noticed that we also did not get all of the dim sum rotations either. For the place being so large, I would expect much more variety. There was no bean curd, no shrimp balls, no shrimp rice noodles. I think part of the hustle of dim sum is selling as much as you can. I also thing the card that they use to stamp leaves a lot of room for counting errors. It was just a blank space with stamps all over the place. When you have two tables of ten, it can  get very dense with stamps. The taste of the food was nothing beyond any dim sum place in my opinion. It tasted cleaner than some of the hole in the wall kind of places but I wouldn't visit again. Unfortunately, my aunt had dinner here the next night and what we ordered was okay. We orders a shrimp soup, walnut shrimp, crispy egg noodle, fried rice, duck combo dish, fish dish, etc. I didn't think the food was worth the hassle of driving to gold coast and walking through the very smoke filled casino. Of note, the roast pork tasted so incredibly stale and hard that I felt like it was leftover from dim sum.",

Crispy skin, moist on inside without too much fatty part  In my book nowhere else in Vegas compares when it comes to dim sum.",

The food is always cold and if you ask for fresh they act like they dont understand or they will microwave it and say its fresh. I enjoy the coconut rolls, there is 2 to an order but one is always an old one and you can tell because the paper is baked on the bottom of the old one. Again if you ask for fresh there is confusion. Now for this next problem im just going to say it like it is...the worst tables in the place usually go to the people who arent asian. If youve been here enough you know its True. Also there is no way to tell what you are being charged for they use a stamp system and its not even in english. So if you like paying 60 to 80 bucks for cold, old, reheated food and like being mistreated and ignored this is your place.",

I especially liked the shrimp balls on the bamboo sticks.  Choy sum with garlic was also good but the plate of choy sum was huge and I couldn't eat all of it. ( Good problem)  I thought it was funny they charge 50 cents for hot tea but I wasn't paying so i didn't care.  I had a soup with beef and mushrooms I think it was ok but the mushrooms tasted weird.  Egg rolls and charsui ba was good.  Service was soso, normal Chinese restaurant where they are pushy and can't understand how much your bill is until the end of the meal.  Overall good and I would go again if I have a comp again at the gold coast.",

    "text": "So I tried this place twice.... the first time I tried the food -  my brother and mom got take out for my dad and I for a late night snack - we had a bowl of Preserved Egg and Pork Porridge and a bowl of Wonton Noodle Soup. The porridge was okay - it was actually kind of bland and I wish I had salt. The Wonton soup was not any better - the noodles were stuck together and the wonton was also very bland.   So even after trying the food here and knowing its not that good- why would I come back again? Well my dad didn't think it was so bad so the next day he wanted to order the same thing - I really didn't want to but he insisted he wanted to eat porridge - so this time we went to order it for take out again.  This time I experienced the service -- and it was ridiculous - took 45 minutes for two dishes...on top of that the waitress was very unfriendly. The chef didn't even remember to make the porridge until I asked the waitress three times after 30 minutes - and she finally asked the chef - which was just standing around - to make it. It took him less than 5 minutes to make it but I waited 45 minutes for it. Then after that I asked her for an extra spoon and she didn't even want to give it. On top  Definitely not a place I want to go back to. Both the food I tried and the service I experienced was pretty bad. On top of that they were pretty expensive.",

The dim sum is surprisingly good and they have most of the stuff that we are familiar with whenever we go...  They charge 50 cents per person for tea which is what a lot of places do but I still consider that outrageous since I'm old school and such a practice was never used (*sigh*)...  Although it's not Alhambra/Monterey Park cheap, (2) $2.18 for dim sum type A, (11) $2.88 for dim sum type B, (4) $3.88 for dim sum type C, and $5.88 for (1) dim sum type D plus the $2 for tea still came out to be less than $60 -- A REAL BARGAIN considering where we are...  We were stuffed and happy for our return trip back to LA.  I would come back again...",

    "text": "In all my years of coming to Las Vegas I never knew really good and authentic Chinese food even existed here. Like others have mentioned, this certainly is a hidden gem.  A couple of friends attending the jewelry trade show at the Mandalay had invited me to a nice quiet high end dinner at the Jasmine Restaurant at the Bellagio when , just as we were about to leave for the Bellagio, my friend received a business call saying their business contacts wanted to invite us for dinner instead.....and were too afraid to decline. All I knew was that I was asked to get in the car and just follow the leader.  Being the fish out of water, I didn't speak a or understand a word of Chinese and had no idea what the plan was. We eventually ended up off the strip at some big stand alone casino across from the Palms Hotel and Casino. As we walked into the casino from the parking garage, my friend whispered to me that the host was taking us to a Chinese restaurant, and if she eats hear you can bet it's going to be VERY good! The host has been living in Vegas for over 30 years so she should know where all the good eating spots are now.....ok, so in we go. This was a medium end casino, and as we walked through it we finally came upon this Chinese Restaurant called \"Ping Pang Pong\"..... yes, you got that right....just as I've spelled it. Flashbacks of the movie \"16 Candles\" flashed through my head, but I'll leave that one alone :)  Tucked inside the casino is this very casual, very Chinese looking, restaurant with an open kitchen concept where you can hear the burners blasting away and the woks clanging away. The place was quite crowded, but it appeared our host knew everybody there and I was told she is a VIP guest there. We came to the table and there sat 4 other of her elderly friends already seating and waiting for us. Oh boy.....there goes my hopes for a peaceful and relaxing dinner. Ok, lets cut it short and say that it was a very typical large table seating for a group of elderly folk who enjoyed their meals with loud talk.....the red wine they were gulping down didn't seem to help matters either. Anyway, I did not understand a single word spoken at the table all night, but no worries.....I had food to keep me busy!......good authentic Chinese food at that! And note, when I say this is authentic food, I mean authentic.....PF Chang's and Panda Express are NOT authentic :P  I pretty much left the ordering to the host and her friends since they seemed to know what good Chinese food should taste like. Needless to say they ordered all very authentic dishes that westerners likely wouldn't have known how to order. Without going into too much detail about each dish.....because I really can't remember the names of each one......we started off with lotus root soup which was very good....absolutely delicious, and coincidentally is my favorite Chinese soup! There was a roast duck dish, lotus root stir fried with celery and rice wine sauce, egg white fried rice with dried scallops, stir fried cubes of beef with a dark brown sauce, ginger and scallion lobster over noodles, farm raised chicken cooked with chestnuts and rice wine, some green vegetables with baby abalone and sauce, sea bass steamed with black beans, ............and I think that was it. It was ALL yummy, and I was really surprised at finding this quality and standard of Chinese food all the way out here! But yes, it exists. Yay! :)  All these delicious dishes for 9 people came to about $295 before tips, which was actually pretty good given the excellent quality of the food. If I should ever find several friends who'll join me for a good Chinese meal during future visits, I will definitely bring them here!",

Because we arrived so early, they seemed to only have desserts ready & those kept coming around quite readily in the beginning. They didn't seem to start bringing out the savory dishes til about 15-20 minutes after they opened. My recommendations? If you arrive early, be patient & wait about 20 minutes til the dishes really start coming out. If not, then show up about 30 minutes after they open, just be prepared to wait. The challenge? Their Servers are all Chinese, which is great, however with all of the noise, hearing them through the noise & their accents was a challenge. Definitely a go to spot from now on!",

But we were seated right away and at first the carts kept passing us by. We all were confused and kept saying hello we want some foods from there. Not until our friend spoke in Chinese did these ladies with the carts come by and were nice to us.   The food was good and cheaper than any other dim sum place I've ever been to in Vegas. We all paid $7 plus tip which wasn't too bad.   We were on a time crunch so we had to quickly get out of there but they didn't feel our urgency even as my friend got up several times to let them know we needed the check.

    "text": "Although the availability of good dim sum in Las Vegas is severely lacking, I may have found a good substitute when I tried Ping Pang Pong this past weekend. Located in the Gold Coast Casino, I never thought I would find something close to decent within a casino. I wouldn't go too much off the fact that the casino boasts this place as one of the top 10 Chinese restaurants in Travel + Leisure magazine, but fresh off a remodel and redesign this past summer, the decor and location are nice enough to attract hotel patrons, and the food is authentic enough to attract locals.   Dim sum service runs from 10:00 am to 3:00 pm, but the carts start tapering off towards the end. They have all the usual classics such as siu mai, chicken feet, BBQ pork buns, and har gow. Although they started running out of some dishes, we asked the manager if we could order the fried crab claws shrimp ball and she got the chef to fry up a fresh batch, just for us. I was pretty happy with that and the service in general. Prices range based on categories of food (A): $2.18 (B): 3.18 (C): $3.88 (D): $5.88. It was pretty affordable for a place that looks much nicer than Yum Cha on Tropicana. The wait time for a table on a Sunday was roughly 10 minutes.",

Our relatives brought us takeout from this place and it was pretty amazing.   Recommendations:  Chive and shrimp cake -- surprisingly crisp and fresh with plenty of shrimp.  Crispy shrimp stuffed chicken -- this was amazing. While it feels a bit like Americanized Chinese food, the meat was tender and had a light coating with a sweet garlic-based sauce and sesame seeds Night market Fried Rice -- Strong basil flavor, tomato based sauce. Unique and definitely different from any fried rice I've had. Yu Hong (Yu xiang) Eggplant -- pretty typical rendition of this sweet and sour eggplant dish, nothing too unusual...  this dish needs white rice on the side.   Cons:  Based on the menu, it's on the pricey side for what it is.   Can't say anything about the service or the dining experience since I wasn't actually there but the food was definitely excellent.",

So me & my family arrive, we were brought in. Not sure what to expect being my first time @ this place (may I add how I was excited & actually having a celebration lunch) & immediately they were wheeling around appetizers asking tables what they would like. So confused on how things work here , mainly because nobody told me. Several times I asked for entrees and each time they told me they had no more.   Never once was I presented a menu, so I literally had a appetizer lunch with no menu  at all, I have never felt so bamboozled & unsatisfied in Chinese food history. LET ME TELL YOU, a bad review from me is very rare, as a matter a fact? This is my first! I hate this place now & I will never recommend this terrible customer service to anybody.   Also, the manager at the time still wanted me to pay the full price for all the crappy little appetizers that were basically forced upon me. I tried to explain my dissatisfaction & how un pleased I was with never receiving a menu, & she told me the customer is suppose to ask for one!! Where do they do that at!? So I'm automatically suppose to know how procedure goes at this restaurant being my first time there!? Bull crap!!! Never again!! Actually , I'm discrediting this restaurant every chance I get in the future, their mistake for the bs service because I have a great network of people to spread a huge word. Ok, rant over. Screw you PING PANG PONG",

I give her a $20 bill and she gives me back $5 & 99 cents in change.  The bill was $14.02.  In the real world and especially the restaurant industry you never hand back 99 cents in change. (It should've been 98 cents). Its a big insult, especially in a business that does such volume.  So here I am to publicly shame this very rude and unintelligent employee.  I think its a greedy cultural thing however we're in the US. In Europe they round to nearest 5 cents.  All principle here.",

It's located off the strip at a casino called Gold Coast, but the drive isn't too far. A parking structure was available so plenty of free parking is provided. When we arrived around 11AM, the wait wasn't long. There were only a couple parties in line. But when we finished, the line was filled with people waiting to eat. So make sure you arrive early!   I'm that person who can eat dim sum anytime and everyday. So seeing all these carts made me happy! The wait for each one to come around was quick. The restaurant is divided into two sections with ten tables at most. Some of my favorites were the BBQ pork buns, the shrimp ha cao and the egg tarts. I especially liked the crust on them because they were flaky! At other dim sum places, it's usually like a pie crust and I'm not a fan of pie.   Service here is pretty good. The server always came around just in time to refill our drinks! Our bill for four people came out to be about $80 including tip which isn't too bad.   Overall verdict: I'll be back!",

Get here early, they close at 3, but it looks like they stop making fresh dim sum at 2 pm. The carts had slim pickings and a lot of things they didn't have anymore, such as the shrimp noodle rolls.   I knocked a star off for the bad service here. The service was extremely slow and rude. After we were seated, no one introduced themselves to us as our server, so we didn't even know who our server was the entire time. Our drink order wasn't taken and tea wasn't brought to us until about 15 minutes after being seated and us having to flag someone down. They don't refill drinks here and they never made eye contact, so I was constantly waving my hand in the air to call someone, anyone over.   Surprisingly, most of the dim sum here was great!   BBQ pork buns - We loved the bbq pork buns, they make a great one here. The moist fluffy bao buns (the white ones that look like clouds) were stuffed generously with moist and tender bbq pork. 5/5  Chicken Feet - whoever butchered the feet, didn't do a good job and there were tiny shards of bone throughout. My boyfriend almost swallowed a couple of small shards. 1/5  Shumai (pork dumpling) - small, but they were moist, flavorful and had a nice texture. 5/5  Har gow (clear shrimp dumpling) - these were also small, but I loved these! Great flavor on the shrimp filling and the clear wrapping was delicate and had a perfect texture. We ordered 2 rounds of them. 5/5  Fried shrimp patty on sugar cane - comes with a sweet mayo sauce. The shrimp ball was very flavorful and went perfect with the mayo sauce. 5/5  Shrimp and vegetable meatball coated in sticky rice - I didn't like the doughy sticky rice on the outside. Also the filling's texture was odd with the soft shrimp ball and chewy bits of vegetable. 1/5  We also ordered a plate of stir fried beef chow mein noodles because we were all still hungry and they barely had anymore dim sum by 2:30 pm. The chow mein noodles were really bland. The beef was tender, but we all couldn't get past on the taste of the chow mein, it was lacking so much! 1/5  Come early, stick with the dim sum and you're golden.",

Not to mention, it's right down the street from our home. It's best to go during lunch as they serve up all the best dim sum dishes. The prices are pretty good too. For two of us we spent less than $50 with tip included. Not bad for 8 dim sum dishes. I would recommend the steamed char siu bao, shrimp dumplings, shu mai, choy sum, and walnut shrimp. All the fried rice I've tried here has been good so take your pick.   This place is usually packed all the time so be prepared to wait or go early to get a good place in line. Service can sometimes be lacking as they seem to not have enough servers who can take your order. Many of the workers do not speak English and therefore will not take orders from customers.",

If you have been to Gold Coast in the past couple years, you'll find that the casino has been trying to attract more and more Chinese tourists.  With Ping Pang Pong, they are able to offer the locals as well as the visitors a taste of the mother land.  That means this place serves authentic Chinese food.  We thought the amount of food for the price paid was not equal; however, even to us Asians the food was quite tasty.",

    "text": "Here's the story-- I was in Vegas at a trade show, a colleague had this place recommended to him as 'great Chinese' so we agreed to try it for dinner. I had the opportunity to check out the Yelp reviews beforehand, so I could see that the general consensus was: don't come weekdays, come weekends for dim sum. We came on a Monday night. I'm a somewhat adventurous eater, so I figured, what the heck.  Bad idea. I have to say--- probably the worst restaurant experience I've ever had. And I'm a very forgiving person. So I DEFINITELY do not recommend coming for dinner on a weeknight. You can decide for yourself if you want to take the chance that it's so much better on weekends as others have noted.  The story: 3 of us got there about 8, the place was maybe 3/4 full during our visit. We ordered 3 dim sum plates for appetizers. These eventually came out, one at a time, about 15 minutes apart. The dim sum was really tasty, but the slow delivery was a bad omen.  Waitress eventually came back to take our entree orders. Colleague #1 got his entree approx. 30 minutes later. Colleague #2 got his entree approx. 30 minutes after colleague #1. Colleague #3 (me) got his entree approx. 30 minutes after colleague #2.  And I had ordered tofu!! During this hour and a half wait, we asked the waitress several times about our order, and she wandered off and came back with various excuses each time. It was clear the kitchen had forgetten entirely about my order. But even from the time they realized they had forgetten me, it STILL took at least 30 minutes to get the food out to our table.  Horrible. And just to make the night memorable for all, my colleague #2, who had ordered a scallop dish, came down with food poisoning that night which stuck with him for the next several days.  Oh, and if you haven't been to the Gold Coast before-- it's a dump.",

This time there was five of us and it was kinda late so was really glad to hear this place is open till 3am on weekends. We were sat within five minutes of arriving and waiter took our drink orders.  She was really quiet at times but really quick.  The menu has a good amount of choices.  My recommendations is get a bowl of soup as an appetizer.  A friend who like asian spots told me once to try start off with one of the soups on the menu.   If the soup is good, then the rest of the food will be good.  We decided to try a soup that had big chunks of pork and asian veggies with had an amazing broth. When it came time to order, we decided to get a bunch off dishes and try a little of each item.  Out of each item, I recommend trying the walnut prawns.  They are amazing!!! My brother enjoyed the roasted duck. The place has a nice appearance and its full of Asians coming with large groups.  The table next to us was complaining about something on the order so there was a lot of arguing in Chinese, I think.  I can't wait to come back and get those walnut prawns!!  Heard they have dim sum during the lunch hours so gonna have to try that some time as well.",

    "text": "I had dimsum at Ping Pang Pong in Gold Coast Casino on Sunday 12/28/08. I was with a party of five adults and one child. We arrived at 11am and was seated at 11:40am even with our Emerald card, which gives us priority seating. Many people were in line and some just went to the front of the line to talk to the hostess. Most were confused as to which line to get in. Make sure you give your name and the number in your party to the hostess; she will then give you a piece of paper with a number that she will eventually call out. Most of the people were inpatient and kept going to the hostess and asking her questions. There were several who looked through the reservation book when the hostess stepped away. It was definitely crowded and as soon as we sat down, we started eating.  The food was great! We had the seaweed salad, BBQ pork noodles, shrimp noodles, pork dumpling, shrimp dumpling, spring rolls, crab balls, spare ribs, BBQ pork buns, BBQ pork pastries, Chinese broccoli, chicken wings, sausage in a bun, potstickers, sesame balls - the usual dishes that we order when we have dimsum. What we couldn't believe was the bill! It was $110 for five adults and one child! Then, I looked over the bill and noticed that they charged us twice for the Chinese broccoli ($8.95 twice!). They did correct the bill, but then we started to question whether the rest of the bill was correct. They charged us for 23 dimsum plates, but we didn't keep track and count our plates! They could have easily charged us an extra 2-3 plates and we wouldn't have known it. As regular dimsum customers, with a party of five to ten people that we usually have, we would pay any where from $10 to $15 per person at the most, including tip! But at Ping Pang Pong, we had to pay about $20 per person! Even though the dimsum was good, the higher price is not worth the wait! Next time, we'll go to Chang's or Orchid's.",

Upon arrival, the long wait, approx 25 min, led me think that this was some place good.  All the good places have lines right?  There were also many other Chinese and other Asian people there which would also be another indicator.  When I sat down and started getting food, I was a bit disappointed.  Some of the food that should have been hot or at least warm was rather cool.  Not the best sign.  Some of the food was good, but having spent over decade in San Francisco and about four years about 10 miles east of Los Angeles, PPP could not compare to any except the lower quality restaurants that I've tried.  If you want a view, this is the wrong place to go because the casino is right outside the restaurant and that is all you see.",

And I have never gone out of my way to drive a few minutes to have dim sum at Ping Pang Pong.  Tonight my husband and I had dinner at Ping Pang Pong.  It was awful.  Not bad awful, terrible awful.  I had the Chilean sea bass which was deep fried in greasy oil.  Seems they deep fried it to avoid the fishiness.  But it did not take away the fishy taste.  My husband had the duck and it was not great.  He was hungry after the duck and we ordered the Gobo Beef dish.  it was so awful we both took a bite and that was it.  Left the entire dish.  We have eaten lots of meals and I have never seen my husband leave a full plate of food.  Service was not great but that never is an issue if the food is good.  The quality of the fish and duck and meat was crap.  The reviews for the dim sum were all pretty good, but having tried the food over dinner, there's no way we will ever go back there.  Still burping from that meal and I think I may be seeing it come back up very soon.",

WAIT:  do NOT come here with a big group.  most tables are meant for max 4 people and if u come with 5 person table...expect to wait over an hour without anyone giving you an estimate of how long the wait is.  also, if you have a gold coast member card, you get to cut, thus making the wait for other people even longer.  in short:  best dim sum in vegas, but not worth the terrible service.  just skip dim sum and drive 4 hours to LA for better dim sum.  -E",

One of the group ordered a tofu dish that was great! I think that was almost the favorite of at least 3 of us! We also had some shrimp and if I remember right pork chops? We also had some hot and sour soup. Overall the food was pretty good but we were all pretty hungry also!

When we're here for dim sum, I will get anything shrimpy and fried with the sweet mayonnaise. How can you go wrong with the combination of those 3? My favorite of which are the sesame shrimp rolls.   When we're here for dinner, we always get the Peking duck, walnut shrimp, and garlic snow pea chutes. At the sound of duck, my 4 year old will pounce for the legs and happily sit there for the next 10 minutes nibbling at them. The skin is crunchy and the duck is meaty compared to other restaurants that serve some starving ducks. Walnut shrimp are crispy fried shrimp with glazed walnuts covered in more of my favorite sweet mayonnaise. Snow pea chutes are ordered to get our vegetable intake for the evening and taste like almost any Chinese vegetable because it's always covered in a garlic, sesame oil stir fry. The snow pea chutes are just nice, tender. and really good at sopping up the garlicky goodness.  Overall, 4 stars because they have great food. I think it's a bit pricey because it's in a casino, but since I never have to pay for it (thanks dad!), the price is just right.",

Here is what I noticed, the local chinese residents of las vegas order there food to-go. The cooks & servers will prepare the to-go orders first before they serve the customers who are eating at the restaurant. That is why customers dining in are waiting for 30 minutes. Almost all the food menu are served with lots of MSG & salted ingredients, yes am saying too salty. The touch of chinese cuisine has disappeared. The lady night manager needs to be replaced. She enjoys arguing customers at night. Messed up!",

DIM SUM: Let me just say, the dim sum here surpasses any in the area.  I've been to KJ in the Rio, Chang's, and Cathay House.  Ping Pang Pong has the best variety, quickest service, and the food is actually served HOT, which is important to me.  Some of the other dim sum places will throw plates of cold food at you, which is unacceptable!  I am a huge fan of dim sum so we will be frequenting this place for just that.    DINNER: MUST TRY THE LOBSTER OVER NOODLES. Honestly, I don't know if I ever need to order anything else here. Their lobster is fan-TAS-tic. Best way to eat here is order \"family-style\"... just order a good variety of fish (the sea bass is great), vegetables, and meat.... and SHARE!  Overall, I enjoyed all of their food and their \"standard Chinese service\", meaning the service isn't usually top-notch at an Asian joint.  The pricing is higher than most places in Chinatown because it is located inside a casino (even though the casino is just Gold Coast). Hey, if they can get away with it, more power to them.",

They don't give me old food that's been around and rejected by other people. If I want the new batch, they'll give me just that.   4. Rice is not free. Blahhh. I love rice.

    "text": "My family always comes here for dinner, so unfortunately we haven't tried the dim sum. Here are my reviews for the entrees we order every time we go there:  Seabass hotpot: this is a hit or miss. Sometimes the seabass is awesomely delicious and sometimes I wonder if it is the same dish I ordered the last time. Overall, it's our favorite thing to order on the menu.  Shrimp fried rice: it's nearly impossible to mess up fried rice unless you tried really hard. In this case, you would dishona our famiry!!! The shrimp is big and not the small wimpy dried ones a lot of the other places give. Can't go wrong if you want a rice dish.  Roasted duck: the skin is gooey, not crispy as I want it. There is very little meat on it. I was a bit disappointed in this one..  Chow fun (dry): this dish is like Asian spaghetti. I like the fresh sprouts that they use and the noodles are always delicious.  Tomato onion scallops: yuck! I love scallops and decided to order this for the first time. There was so much sweet and sour dressing on it, it was like drinking that thing. Ugh... I expected it to be fried scallops with fresh tomatoes and onions, but i guess I was wrong on this dish. Just thinking about this dish gives me horrible flashbacks and makes me want to gag. No beuno!!!!  Service: usually really quick, but a few times we waited forever or they forgot our order.. The price is fairly cheap for the amount of food you get. I noticed that you get so much more food if you take it to go than eating there. :)",

Seems like Orchid is going downhill for my taste. They serve everything here for what is seemingly cheaper and better tasting. Word to the wise though, as with all dim sum places, come well before 1:30pm or else they'll be fresh out of everything. They refused to make any more dim sum items after that point.",

    "text": "Dim sum (essentially Chinese tapas) is impossible to find in Dayton, OH.  As such, going for dim sum at Ping Pang Pong was a priority for me.  The wife and I had previously been to Ping Pang Pong before its recent renovations.  The renovated space seemed much larger, brighter, and more open to better allow the carts to move around the dining room.  I definitely thought the renovations worked out well.  We arrived at the restaurant on Sunday before 11AM, which was a smart move because by 11:30, the place was packed and a line had formed with people waiting to get in.    The dim sum came out of the kitchen fresh and hot at a regular frequency wheeled around the dining room on small carts.  While the restaurant may have been expanded and renovated, the food was as delicious as I remembered.  Pro tip:  Larger parties (4 or more) are more optimal for dim sum dining than a party of two.  However, I do think prices have increased by more than a bit since our previous visit.  Ping Pang Pong is legit and is my favorite place to get my dim sum fill when I'm in town.",

The name itself is horrible - but the food is great! For the carts and the visual appetite is only during lunch hours, I found this out the hard way going in later in the evening. I think the carts and see what is available is an experience. You get all the smells and it encourages you to try something new. The best part is whatever you don't finish they box up for you. Some of my favorites are the har gow shrimp and the mung bean sesame balls. This little gem of a place is located in the Gold Coast Casino. It does not disappoint but get there early because the lines get long!",

All times we were super impressed wanting more.  I would say this,, to the readers, don't just go by reviews on this spot, try it. It might be a real delicious experience",

However, I went there for some late night eats after I landed in Las Vegas late at night. I ordered some spare ribs with black bean sauce [dim sum dish] and the salt and pepper fried pork chops. Both were very good and consistent with my expectations for what they should taste like from the same dishes in New York, specifically Chinatown. I definitely recommend Ping Pang Pong if you are craving Chinese food and do not want to venture out to Chinatown in Las Vegas.",

    "text": "These two hosts are so so bad with some serious attitude, lack of guest services training ! I and my wife went in for dim sum, the tall skinny one saw us walking in she never give us any eye contact nor say hi, never smile but got a face full with attitude expression, she just bend down grab a menu and start walking off to our table without saying anything to us. We didn't even sat down yet and she already took off. When we done with our meal and asked for a check, the other girl on the right of the picture delivered our check to the table without saying anything either and slam the check down on the table and then just walk off. This was only at 10:30am in the morning, the rush didn't even start yet. My blood pressure just shoot up to the ceiling, so I asked to the speak to the manager and explained how these two are so so poor in guest services and look so very much like how much they hate their job. On top of that they give bad name and reputation to the place and to the other people in that place that do such a wonderful job and also to the Chinese people around the world about bad manner that already been spreading for years ! What I want to know is how did these two get a job in there as a host in front of the house, or you guys just hire anyone of from the street without screening. The manager did handle and control the situation very well. To these two hosts .. If you hate your job so much, please do not come to work and give your other good team workers and the place such a bad name. We will not visit this place again because of the facts that these two are working there, just by looking at them really ruin my appetite. To Christy ( the general manager of Ping Pang Pong ) I hope you will handle these matter in a proper way. They serious need a drive and an attitude correction with serious guest services training !!!!!",

The food is, first of all not tasty at all (neither the Chinese nor the American at our table likes it).. the bun is definitely brought from the supermarket... and the seafood aren't even fresh which almost makes me throw out... and most importantly, the food is NOT freshly made!!!!! Half of the food that we ordered turns out to be half cool, that's when we realized that the food are made before(or even left over from other table, which I hope it's not).   The service is REALLY BAD!!! They missed some orders, and when we ask for it they just replied in a very bad manner saying that we didn't order it. We then later ask them why the food was cold, again, they replied in a very rude manner saying that they wouldn't precook any food and there's nothing they can do!? Then they recook the food with water... which make the food taste worse...   Then, they even charge a large amount of tip automatically...   Too many other bad experience that we had that I don't want to even mention. Ruined our family day, please avoid coming here!   ,,,,... !!!",

    "text": "I used to check in this place for dim sum whenever I'm in town. After the recent visit I feel that I'm not a fan anymore.   My favorite dish, BBQ pork pastry, has become so bad recently. The pastry became so thick and lost the nice crispy texture. We also tried fried rice roll, which was supposed to be \"very savory\" - Meh. Very bland. Other items, such as fried shrimp ball and chicken feet, were still nice to have.  I wonder if they are taking any cost-reduction measures, because I feel there are fewer carts going around. Some items, especially fried dishes, no longer come in carts - they simply have some ladies carrying them around by hand.  Even if the place is not as good as it was, it still worths 3 stars. But given so many good dim sum places popped up in Vegas recently, I decide not to waste my time here.",

I think the carts are on the weekends. Make sure you try the roasted crispy chicken in the scallion soy sauce. So simple, and so good.  Now that we moved to the west coast & I've had the chance to try dimsum in many more restaurants, I now realize they have one of the best dimsum I've tried. Everything I have tried here has great texture & all flavorful. The exterior of all the dimsum I have tried here are all delicate & thin as I prefer. Soft & chewy in the inside too. Other dimsum I have tried has been tough & chewy. And really missing the flavor ping pang & another favorite I have in Vegas has. Las Vegas really knows how to do dimsum.   As for service, they can get busy sometimes. But we usually have great service.",

    "text": "\"Sundays are for Dim Sum. While the rest of America goes to church, Sunday School, or NFL games, you can find Chinese people eating Cantonese food.\"  Eddie Huang  So our friend wanted to grab some dim sum at a place he was profusely gushing about.  I was pretty unimpressed as a Cantonese person and after the meal, he echoed my sentiments.  What's the big deal?  I suppose it's the best dim sum in Las Vegas but places in Arizona have impressed me more.  I can't believe we drove all the way to Gold Coast to try this place!  It may be because we were here for dim sum on a Thursday but the food was pretty cold despite being in steam carts.  We tried a wide variety of dishes and the salt water dumpling, egg tarts, and the chicken feet were the only ones that were particularly good.  Salt water dumpling is always good because they're fried, the egg tart is generous with custard filling, and the chicken feet had a good sauce on them.  Plus, they were really plump!  I did find the roe on the siu mai and other various dumplings to be interesting.  They didn't add much the dish themselves but it was okay.  Service is that of all dim sum places: basic.  They do treat Cantonese and Mandarin speakers a lot better than the English speaking customers. 3.5 stars!",

The dim sum served on the grill/fried/pastry cart all came out cold... like the eggplant, eggtarts, and this fried dough with minced pork. Very disappointing, especially it was the first time I took my foreign best friend out to try dim sum... bet he didn't have the best impression.  Besides the cold food, the taste of everything else was average to below average... prices are slightly higher than local spots out of the casino.   I will not be returning.",

    "text": "I was looking for a good dim sum joint in Vegas. When I travel, I like to try the dim sum from other places. This place did not disappoint. It's located at The Gold Coast Hotel, all the way in the back. I have to give this place props for the nostalgic Chinese feel to it. Everything from the  tables to the uniforms scream Chinese. It seems so out of place at this hotel. It's as if it's in it's own little bubble.  We got there about 10:30am and there was no wait. The place opens at 10:00am. When we left an hour later, the place was packed. When we first got there, I heard the workers speaking in Cantonese, a good sign. The hostess sat us at a table and gave us one of those stamp cards. Every time we took something from the cart that they pushed by us, they would stamp the card. That's how they total the bill at the end. This is the only dim sum place that I've been to that charged for tea. With that being said, the dim sum here is a good deal compared to Hawaii, where I'm from. All the items were about a dollar cheaper.   We had the black bean spare ribs, chicken feet, shrimp dumplings, stuffed eggplant, and the hot tofu dessert. These are pretty much my staples. I tend to order the same items at dim sum. I have to say the food is excellent. Everything that we ordered was on point. The shrimp in the dumplings was fresh and the wrapper translucent. The chicken feet was plump and huge. The eggplant was stuffed with shrimp paste. My favorite was the hot tofu dessert. It was silky smooth and so yummy with the ginger syrup. It was as good or better than most dim sum places in Hawaii.  As with most dim sum places, you get better service if you speak Cantonese. After the hostess sat us, no carts came around for a while. As soon as I asked for shrimp dumplings in Cantonese, the hostess waved all the carts over. Within 10 seconds, I had all four carts in front of me. My husband was laughing because he knew the drill. This happens at a majority of dim sum places that we go to.",

    "text": "This is one of the best dim sum spots in Vegas. The food is always good, and has average prices. However, there are several drawbacks to Ping Pang Pong.   The first, is that unless you get there right when it opens, you will have to wait in line. The line can sometimes take 10 minutes, but more often it will take much longer. This can be infuriating at times, because they have two sides to the restaurant and often keep people in line when half the restaurant is still empty. I understand that they don't want half the restaurant unattended by employees, but this place is so small that really shouldn't be a problem.   Second, service is hit or miss. At times, they are attentive and you don't have to wait long to get your food. But at others, you can wait a long time before you get any food, or your drinks refilled. When it's busy, you need to leave your table with your food ticket and basically attack the food servers, since dim sum is brought out on carts. If you don't then you might not get food for a while.   Third, while most things are great here, especially the char siu bao (bbq pork bun) and dessert buns, there are also things which are sub-par. The most disappointing is the lo mai gai (stuffed sticky rice). While it works in a pinch, I don't recommend getting it here.  All in all, this is a good place to come for dim sum, just make sure you arrive early and are ready to attack the servers for food.",

I asked if I can be moved to a more inner location in my desperate attempt to get away from the smoke but the lady said there isn't anywhere she could move me even though I clearly saw many empty tables.

Places with casinos just seem to operate under that model.  However, this place comes pretty close as close can get with being authentic Chinese food. Their dim sum dishes are pretty close to the same ones served in NYC. The selection of food on the non-dim sum menu is made fresh in the kitchen and very tasty - packed with flavor. If one is having a craving for real good Chinese food - check this place out. Hopefully, one comes on a good day when there isn't a long line. I got the sauteed pork chops and their house special lo mein. Sooooo yummy!  On a side note, the woman sitting in the table next to me with 3 kids was a cowgirl redneck and thought this placed served 4 piece chicken wings and pork friend rice. She left super fast after the waitress served her bread and water and she realized dishes on the menu was not food she was accustomed to. Some people can be so uncultured and classless!",

I was not feeling adventurous to try frog legs or the live eel dish and was a little put off that they offer shark fin soup. Service was far and friendly, my ice tea never ran dry. Place was clean, well lit and not too noisy. But then it was 11:20pm.   Soup was delicious with plenty of shrimp, chicken white meat, BBQ pork and pork filled wontons. Throw in some greens, scallions, mushrooms and it is a shareable portion. He second dish was Singapore Rice noodles. Again, plenty of meat and it arrived steaming hot. I added some red chilli paste as I found the curry spicing a little lighter than my preference. It too was delicious.   Overall, 4 stars and a definite recommend to my friends, family and fellow Yelpers. Also, I found it to be a good value considering it is in Vegas.",

I got some boba milk tea and pork buns, he got some soups and orange chicken. He place the order to be ready at 12:20 or so. I left work and went to go pick it up. I walked up to the stand and told them I had a pick up order. They asked me for an order number, which I thought was odd. I told them I didn't have the number but it was his phone number/this name. They said they needed the order number or they couldn't give me the order. I tried to call my friend for 5 minutes but he was asleep and didn't answer. They saw me struggling and asked what I ordered. I told them and they picked up the order right behind them and verified the phone number I originally gave them... It would have been nice for them to take that originally. I wanted out with my order. By the time I got home the ice in the boba was melted but everything we ordered was really good. It wasn't their fault I didn't have the order number but they could have just checked the phone number that was on the receipt. Anyways, pork buns were bomb and the orange chicken was delicious!! I'll remember to get the order number for next time.",

    "text": "Have been very unimpressed with both the food quality as well as the rapdily declining service at Ping Pang Pong over the past 6 months or so. New floor management is certainly to blame, yet the front line staff is also to blame. The areas where service is falling short: Failure to greet customers in a timely fashion 2. Lack of a genuine greeting  3. Rushed order-taking. 4. Failure to touch the table more than once per dining experiece (cover). Management (on the floor) has not properly addressed these issues & is failing to ensuring any reasonable level of service. I recently noticed 2 or 3 other guests laughing in the restaurant while dining alone. After speaking with a couple of them, I later learned through our conversation that they were loyal customers for many years, but that the service levels are now \"laughable\". This, I am not alone in this review....I am also not hesitant to make it. Ping Pang Pong will be given one final chance to remedy this poor situation. Two stars will become 1 star if the next experience mirrors this one. There are too many other options out there.....",

    "text": "Quick run through review...  Dim sum in Vegas?  Okay!!! :D   This restaurant is off the strip at the Gold Coast Casino.  The restaurant itself is on the actual casino floor with kind of limited seating so expect to wait unless you're lucky.    Overall the dim sum is pretty standard when it comes to dim sum, couldn't complain in the taste or MSG overdose afterwards.  I just don't remember if they had my favorite chili paste Sambal Oelek there or not, they may might have had the regular chili oil, which IMO is not the freaking same!  (So if any Asian restaurant owners/managers are reading this please read carefully....Sambal Oelek chili paste can not be substituted with chili oil or any other brand!  Damnamit.)    Although....one thing that I did enjoy over here specifically was their jellyfish during dim sum hours.  Idk, either the places I go to don't offer jellyfish at dim sum or I just barely missed the very last portion to some lucky sonofabitch.  :/  Other than the jellyfish, their name 'Ping Pang Pong' and that its in Vegas... nothing really stands out to me as I can have the same at any one of the numerous dim sum restaurants in Cali.  Nice place to check out nonetheless if you suddenly have a craving attack for dim sum and the 'Asian' foods at the buffets aren't satiating that craving.",

How about wash your veggies properly.  I asked for his name and the staff will not say.  We paid and left.  Called Gold Coast to file a complaint and they can't do anything about it because they are independently owned.  If I could... I would rate Ping Pang Pong a negative 10 stars.",

    "text": "This restaurant is located in The Gold Coast Hotel Casino and turned out to be our favorite.  With the sad (but finally improving) state of Chinese food in SW Florida we needed to get our fill and ate here three times.  Things got off to a shaky start.  Four of us ordered; Seafood Crispy Noodles ($10.95), Tea Duck, (half $12.95) Beef Lo Mein ($9.95) and Ma Po Tofu ($7.95).  It was a Saturday night and the place was busy but our order was taken promptly.  Interestingly after a reasonable wait we inquired about our food and it miraculously started to arrive, albeit one dish at a time making it seem like the order was never entered.    The duck was cooked to a crispy goodness but was served without any dipping sauces - Hoisin was brought on request.   The two noodle dishes were large portions with the seafood noodle including ample pieces of fish, Scallops, Squid.  The fourth dish Tofu was a complete no-show with a different server offering to get it but advising the \"kitchen is slammed\", we declined and the check was adjusted accordingly.  Lunch here is Dim Sum served from a parade of steaming carts.  We tried some old favorites and few new things.  All was fresh and presented with care.  We tried a favorite of many Asians; Chicken Feet and now realize this is an acquired taste, however the fried rice served with it was the absolute best we ever had.  So that's how fried rice should taste!  We ate our fill and had many items with the bill for two at just $30.00.  If you've never had a traditional Dim Sum meal this is definitely the place.  One more dinner visit included our all time favorite Beef Rice Flat Noodles ($9.95) also known as Chow Fun served \"wet\".  The beef was tender and the noodles just delicious coated in the light flavorful gravy.  This dish included a few large pieces of perfectly cooked Gai Lan.  With this we had Orange Beef ($9.95) cooked just slightly crisp with an outstanding flavor.  We stuffed ourselves to help prolong the memory.  They claim to be Las Vegas' \"best\" Chinese restaurant and the fact that on each visit we were just about the only non-Asians there would seem to prove them right.",

    "text": "Two friends and I dined at Ping Pang Pong this week for dinner, and our expectations could not have been higher. I lived in China briefly and one of my accompanying friends is from the Philippines and her mother makes incredible Asian cuisine. So, when we heard that PPP was one of the most authentic and well-received Chinese restaurants in America, we couldn't wait to try it.  Immediately, I was pleased with our server, who noticed we were ordering things without meat and asked if we were vegetarians. We said yes, and she informed us that many of the items were cooked with chicken broth, but said she'd ensure it wasn't used in our dishes. Unfortunately, we concluded that the chicken broth must be Ping Pang Pong's top secret ingredient, because we were rather disappointed in our food! It pains me to say I've had better tasting meals at Panda Express.  Here's what we ordered and my thoughts on it: -Wrinkled Green Beans: Bland, but nothing a little extra hot sauce couldn't fix.  -Ma Po Tofu: Good seasoning but we would have preferred a firmer tofu over the squishy one. -Sauteed Lotus Root: The fact it was described as \"pungent\" on the menu should have been a red flag. It was too crunchy and the taste of vinegar was over-whelming. -Shanghai Noodles: We got it without the pork, and it was basically oily ramen. Big portions a plus, though. -Rice: Dried out and hard!   -Iced Chrysanthemum tea: It was akin to drinking potted plant water. -Fresh Coconut Juice: It was on the menu, but apparently not available. I hate it when that happens.  Ultimately, I was disappointed with Ping Pang Pong and don't plan on returning. Another patron might have better luck ordering Dim Sum or a meat dish, as apparently both have been praised. However, I'll stick to other establishments/fly to China the next time I want authentic noodles/have my friend's mom cook for me! :D",

    "text": "My family doesn't really like to go out to Chinese restaurants very often since my dad was once a Chinese chef and knows how to cook dishes very well himself. When we do go out or get take-out however, it's always from 'Ping Pang Pong' (still don't understand the logic of this name choice..). He always raves how this is a really good Chinese restaurant and they cook their dishes with all the right ingredients and proportions. The pricing is very suitable too. You would assume being inside a casino, they would charge more than the actual dish is worth, but the price range is about $6-8 for a good portion of food per dish.   My dad would be the one to know all the technical stuff with what is a good quality Chinese dish and bad quality. The reason why I know this restaurant really lives up to the 'Best Chinese Restaurant' awards plastered around the entrance is because the traffic that I have seen come in and out of this restaurant, and the number of to-go orders that are bunched up on their large counter space everytime I am here. It's ridiculous! We've had to wait a good 45 minutes for our to-go order (3 dishes) to come out, so my advice is if you're looking for some take-out.. make sure you order way ahead of time of when you expect to actually eat.  Had dimsum the other day and they don't have a wide variety of options but for what they do have, it's superb quality in my opinion! Really loved their turnip cake. Best I've ever had!   4 instead of 5 stars is just because I wish their floor space was a little larger and had more selection of dimsum items, but as for their quality of food.. 5 stars for sure.",

There's little to say about the Asian restaurants in Vegas (compared to the San Gabriel Valley), but this place hit the spot, especially since I was bored of having French/Italian food.  I've visited this place for dim sum about 3 - 4 times now and the food has ALWAYS been consistent.  You get the typical har gow, siu mai, chicken feet, and steamed buns.  What you DON'T get is stuff like shark fin soup or the more \"expensive\" type dim sum.  The only item I did not enjoy very much is the shen zen bao (pan-friend pork buns)...no juicy orgasmic flavors there.  The bills usually averaged about $50 - $60 for 2-3 ppl consisting of approximately 12 - 14 dishes.  A little more expensive than the Cali dim sum places, but it is Vegas, ya know.  Sure, the name of the restaurant sounds racist, but if you owned a jam-packed restaurant like that, so what?  And...the fact this small joint is in a casino...even betta!!

Its Chinese name is Jin Yuan Bao (lit. gold ingots) which is a much better name especially to those high rollers in Vegas.  It is actually much better than the dim sum restaurant in Las Vegas Chinatown on Spring Mountain Road.",

All over the San Gabriel Valley, OC, Los Angeles, San Francisco, etc, etc.   This place amazed me! There is TRULY great Chinese food in Vegas, and Dim Sum as well!    Located in the Gold Coast, this place was filled with Asians devouring Dim Sum for breakfast.    Siu Mai. Har Gow. Bean Curd rolls. Fried Taro thing. Beef Meat Ball.  Other misc. Dim Sum.  Lop Chong Fried Rice.  Low Mein.   All frickin amazing. I'd put this place up against some of the places in the So. Cal/No. Cal area.    Definitely worth a try!!!",

Probably the best roast duck I've had in years: not as fatty and more meaty than a True Peking Duck but delicious nevertheless.  Both HK and Macau style egg tarts for daan taat freaks.   Other dim sum very typical but well done.  A variety of noodle and rice dishes and wonderful claypots like the scallop and greens pot. BTW they also have a noodle house at this same Casino so you can try other dishes including Hot Pot.  Only small issue is the seating: too many large tables go partly occupied. In Asia, a large table would be seated with two or even three parties so you don't waste a ten seat table on just three people",

Of all the things we ordered the only thing i can call an Epic Fail were the deep fried shrimp balls with crab claw it was very bland and tasteless even for a deep fried dish.  The steamed buns are fresh and very soft and hot but the filling was bland and tasteless if it wasn't for the color i wouldn't have known it was suppose to be Chinese bbq pork.

    "text": "Dim sum here is pretty good for a Vegas joint. However, I did not like the service! When my friend and I first got here (around 1130), we had to wait about 10-15 min before we could get some tea or even water to drink! It wasn't even that busy yet, and we were seated right away! Usually, at many dim sum places, it is automatic to get tea or water right away! Also, the carts did not come to our side very often, so we had to make sure to get plenty of things before we started really eating! (Especially the dessert cart! Geez! That one took forever to come by!).  The place is also pretty small. We can barely get into or out of our seats, since they were so close together (so I just stayed in mine the whole time without moving it heheh!).   The only thing that I tried here that was not as common as other dim sum places was their soft tofu dessert with sugar/ginger syrup. It tasted like a Filipino dessert called Ta-ho (except Ta-ho is sweeter and not ginger-tasting). That was pretty good. They also had a seaweed salad, (which looked very good but didn't come until we were waiting for our check), and we couldn't try it! Other than those two, just your typical dim sum place with a limited quantity of items!  I probably would not go back here, especially if I ever have to wait! Geez...wait for a table...and then WAIT for a drink...and then WAIT for the dim sum...and even WAIT for our check/to go boxes!   Unless you're with a big party, this place would probably be decent to have dim sum. Be ready to FLAG those cart people! Expect a wait on the weekends starting around 12 (We went on a Sunday).   Btw, the price for most of the dim sum is about $3 a piece, so it could add up if you want to try lots of things...(They also charge for tea!)",

ANyway, a friend of mine said that this place is good.  So, we gave it a try.  We noticed their giant billboards all over the place.  Anyway, we got there. Although, it wasn't full house, they were quite busy.  We waited for a few minutes after we got our tables to be approached by the ladies with the dim sum carts.  We ordered quite a lot. As 2 giant piggies, we finished everything.  :) The conclusion is good food, price is not bad. The only thing that keeps me from giving 5 stars is the service.  There was totally none.  We'll probably come back here just to grab quick dim sum.",

However, it's definitely one of the better places in town (and my favorite) for dim sum.  The restaurant is little bit small, so expect a bit of a wait on crowded days.  If you don't see a dish that you want being carted around, you can ask and they will generally make it for you.  Prices are a little bit more expensive than the other places in town, but not that much (maybe 50 cents to a dollar more per dish).  Also, I saw Johnny Chan eating here once.  If Ping Pang Pong is good enough for Johnny Chan, it's good enough for me, and probably you, too!",

    "text": "I recently tried Ping Pang Pong and I must say it's my least favorite dim sum place in Vegas.  It barely qualifies as dim sum since the dining area is tiny, the only view is of slot machines, there are so few clients since it's so small that the food selection is nearly nil!!  Some of the food is brought on trays since there's barely room for the carts.  I took my wife and in-laws who were born and raised in mainland China and they agree it's nothing special compared to Orchid Gardens although they did like the chicken feet and congee they ate.  I couldn't come up with enough dishes to even eat so we bailed out after a couple of dishes and ate at the buffet instead!!  My wife commented that even the hot sauce was the cheap kind.  None of my favorite \"ribs\" and no Chinese broccoli in sight.  Prices were nothing special and it had zero atmosphere.  All this in spite of the fact that we know one of the servers.  I hate to say it but the service was also marginal.  As an example of my dim sum credentials we checked out two dim sum spots in San Francisco the week before.  How about dim sum for four people including duck for all of $12.50?  This was at the Oriental Tea House in San Leandro.  Great place and not just because the food was cheap.  Go to Orchid Gardens for dim sum.  Real atmosphere, great food selection and even friendly service!",

It was solid and pretty consistent for Dimsum. Fresh, the restaurant staff spoke Cantonese (which is the kind of Chinese that dimsum comes from). I give it a 4 because the dimsum is what I would expect out of a decent dimsum, but not AMAZING. For being in a hotel/casino, it's pretty good as well. Dimsum is usually either good or really bad. LOL It's tough to make it bad, but it happens quite a bit.  Whatever chinatown you go to, usually the crowded dimsum places are the best and having to wait in a line in vegas for dimsum meant Ping Pang Pong was decent and it was.  I would say it's a little bit above average.    Also...I'd have to say...dimsum and blackjack is quite a kool combination ya? lol.

Limited Dim-sum selection and the actual square-footage is quite small.  Not too shabby for a Casino Dim-sum restaurant.",

The quality of the dim sum was pretty good, not the best but better than a lot of places in Orange county.    The prices were decent too, i think it ranged from $2-6 a dish.  We stuffed ourselves for $30.",

Dim Sum 10am to 3pm  Price:  Fair Food:  Overall is good *Shrimp Ball - Good *Chicken Feet - Below Average because it is not well done enough *Chicken with mushroom over rice in a bamboo container - Not good (There were very little chicken on top of the bamboo container and it tasted frozen and stalled.  The rice is too dry.)  Don't order this dish. *Lau Sa Bau (Sweet bun with yellow filling) - Bad.  The bun part is fine but the filling is awful.  The filling should be in bright yellow color and a light sweet taste to it.  When I bit into it, it appeared in this orange color and the taste is funny.  So, don't order this either. *Steamed Spare Ribs - Ok and very oily and fatty. Service:  Excellent Environment:  Comfortable  I will check my parents into this hotel next time for it's Asian themed and catering services.  My parents will love the convenient of this hotel and restaurant.",

Thank goodness because sometimes it is hard to understand the servers and vice versa. It has to be good if Chinese people eat there in my humble opinion! And there is almost always a line. The food is AMAZING, very fresh and plenty of it, in fact, you will probably overeat. My favorite are the Cha Siu Baos (there are 2 similar versions, one in a sweet white bun and the other in a darker, flakier, triangle shaped bun with sesame seeds) Both are outta this world! Highly reccomend!",

Ate here for the 1st time last year for my birthday dinner before heading out to the clubs (not a good idea btw esp when you have lots of alcohol to drink after eating this type of food if you catch my drift. lol!). The closest I've eaten authentic chinese food since I been in Vegas.  I still have yet to try the ones at chinatown unfortunately.  Chinese food is actually one of my favorite ethnic foods & this was ok. Again, I still have yet to try other chinese food places.  Just as long it's not like a Panda's (which I have no problem with.  Just too americanized for me.) lol. Anyways, we had a few dishes during my birthday dinner but I don't remember all the names.  The walnut prawn is very good. A little on the creamy side but still good.  Huge prawns! Peking duck was as it should taste.  =) The ma po tofu was good.  A lil spicy but not too spicy.  The fried rice we had I believe was the pineapple seafood one.  Yum.... Ate here a second time this yr after a concert & tried the black pepper beef medallions.  Very good as well.  Service on both times i went here were a little slow.  Even when filling up on drinks.  At least it was clean! haha! =) I would go back again.  Next time I have to try the dim sum.",

PPP goes oldschool with their dimsum carts, featuring congee or bean curd dishes.  I really enjoyed their char siu rice rolls, which had large pieces of bbq pork in them.  I thought their Siu Mai was just average, they were pretty small actually.  But overall, the dimsum was good.  We didn't receive great service here, the dimsum carts came but the rest of the employees ignored us when we needed some plum sauce or water.  But I wasn't too surprised, if you want the authentic Chinese restaurant experience, you have to expect the not-so stellar service.  I prefer to hit the Chinatown area for dimsum but if you are staying at a hotel on the strip, PPP isn't too far out the way to get yourself a dimsum fix with some authentic dishes.",

Also had the pea sprouts, deep fried sea bass and roast pork belly - all amazing.  I'm Chinese and I've had my share of Chinese food ;) and this is some of the best!    PS- this is a real Chinese restaurant so people who are expecting impeccable 5-star service are unrealistic - go to the aforementioned places I talked about instead.  Let's be real- You're never going to get that kind of service here. You will get efficient and courteous service and that's all you could really ask for, people!",

I had a comp room at Gold Coast, and my usual eateries there are the Buffet (which is alright) or TGI Fridays, or I walk across the street to the Rio Buffet. This trip I decided I had a hankering for Chinese food, but I wasn't brave enough to go down a few blocks to Spring Mountain for the real authentic stuff, so I decided to go to the place we all joked about, Ping Pang Pong.  I was pleasantly surprised.  The service was great! Everyone was smiling with quick, prompt service. They were knowledgeable about their food too. I had the Pineapple Seafood Fried Rice, which had shrimp, scallops, and calamari in it. It was so tasty, and I filled up quite quickly.  I'm not quite sure on the authenticity of the food, I am certainly not the judge on that. But the food was good. Price was a tad high but certainly the food delivered.",

The standard dishes - chinese broccoli, xiu mai, ha cao, chicken feet, black bean pork ribs, steamed bbq pork bun, shrimp wrapped in thick rice noodle, chinese donut wrapped in rice noodle - were all a-ok.  The rice and chicken served in a vertical bamboo cup was tasty; flavors were similar to Vietnamese 'com ga', with ginger, light soy, and chicken.  The xiu mai had orange/yellow 'eggs' on it which tasted like crab innards/tomal/mustard; rich and super flavorful.  All the dumplings were packed with meat and/or seafood and not a lot of fillers (yay!).  The only downside is that the offerings are limited/uninspired; just the basics.  I'd come back if I were in LV and craving dim sum.  Other important info: small establishment, push cart servers, prices are higher than CA but definitely reasonable, located inside Gold Coast Hotel off the Strip next to RIo and across from the Palms.",

    "text": "I have mixed feelings about this place.  The food was pretty good, but the overall experience was kind of blah.  The restaurant itself is inside the Orleans, off to the side, and gated in,  but not really closed off from the casino.  There are paintings of happy Asian babies on the walls, and the clinking, and beeping of slot machines in the air.  The machines are only about 15 feet away, so there's cigarette smoke wafting in too.    I very rarely drink soda, so when I do, I want it to be kind of special. There was nothing special about my watered down Pepsi.  :( I told the server that the soda tasted off, and that the syrup needed to be changed.  He nodded, took my glass, ran off, and came back with the exact same crap, which kind of pissed me off.  Whatever.  We didn't come for the Pepsi.  Pot stickers:  These were really good. The wrappers were thicker than any pot stickers I've tried before.  They reminded me more of Russian pilmeni (I love those, so it worked out).  Hot and sour soup:  My boyfriend had a serious issue with this soup. He looked borderline pissed off after trying it.  It wasn't really spicy, or sour.  In fact, we were pretty sure it wasn't hot and sour soup, but the server assured us that it was.  I thought it tasted fine, but it wasn't what either of us expected, or craved. Lame.  Kung Pao chicken:  I thought this dish was great.  The chicken was juicy, all white meat, and perfectly sauced.    Shanghai noodles:  The noodles were cooked well, and the vegetable ratio was nice.  The mushrooms in it were really tasty, but the pork was barely there.  It came in tiny half-inch slivers, thinner than the noodles themselves.  It was delicious, but it should have had more meat in it.  Overall, it was okay, but I doubt we'd come back.",

    "text": "I was a little hesitant to try this place out due to the mixed reviews. I was starving and this place is located inside the Gold Coast Hotel and Casino. Parking was not a problem, but that might be because I'm here on a Monday! I was pleasantly surprised by the food and service so I'm glad we ended up giving it a chance. We were seated right away and the carts came by pretty often. The food was hot and fresh. I actually thought the dim sum was decent and they had a great selection to choose from. Our water was refilled frequently and a food server made her round to ask every table if everything was okay. Although I've been spoiled with dim sum in LA county and OC, it certainly satisfied the dim sum craving. The best thing about it next to service is the pricing!",

Make sure you get there early as there is a line during the rush hour. The dim sum is good the service is ok. We went in during the Sunday brunch crowd, a group of 10 and they sat us on two tables as my buddy (who is a Vegas local), was able to make a reservation for us.   I loved their dim sum. You name it, Har Gow, Siu Mai, noodles, spare ribs, baos, etc...it was all pretty good. What sucked was the popular items such as the Har Gow (shrimp balls) and Siu Mai (steaming dumplings) always ran out. Every cart that rolled through all said \"later\".   Yummy for Vegas standards....",

    "text": "Came here twice on consecutive days for dim sum, which says something about the food. It's super good. Everything you'd expect for dim sum, plus some. Also, you can order off the menu. This place is very reasonably priced.  However, be prepared for a long wait if you come between the hours of 11am to 1pm. We got there a little before 11, and didn't sit down until 12:15. The line moves pretty slowly. The cutoff time is 3pm, and that's the exact time they stop coming around with carts. On the second day, we got there around 2:30 thinking we had some time, but they stopped serving soon after. The waitress was nice enough to give us a small plate on the house.  The service is not the best. The busboys who take your order for drinks take forever to refill ice water, as well as hot water for tea. When we asked about refills as he was passing, he seemed really pissed. Sour attitude throughout the meal. However, the ladies who come around with the dim sum carts are pretty friendly, and although it may not be their job, if you ask them about refills or missing utensils, they will make sure you get it right away.  It's a little far of a walk from the Strip, but we walked the 1 mile with no problems. The weird pedestrian walkway bridge makes it seem longer. You can take the free shuttle from Paris, Bally, or Harrahs to and from Rio, the casino next door.",

They have your typical dim sum eats (shu mai, Har gao, sesame balls, baos, etc.) and the food alone was a solid 4 stars. But service was incredibly horrible, and staff incredibly rude so minus 2 stars.   They seated us in a section away from the main dining tables, so the carts were rarely seen in our section. The 5 main carts being pushed around only passed us maybe 2x in the hour and a half we were there.   Bottom line, if you don't have the luxury of time or blessed with the ability to be patient when you're starving, don't come. If you do come, try to show up early, and try to be seated in the main dining area where the carts like to pass you 10x more than the other area that is blocked off by a wall.   Food was expensive, for dim sum. The 3 of us ordered maybe 13 cart items, with tea, and our total was $75 and some change. Sorry, but I'm from LA, and the cost of dim sum there is about 1/2 with even better food, and just as bad service lol. But I guess for Vegas quality dim sum, this is one of the \"better\" options.   The shu mai was really good, and the red bean sesame ball was epically good. Not worth coming back though. We tipped them under 3% for the jack ass waiter who pitched a tone at my mom when she was complaining to him about lack of cart service. That was us being nice, since the service received was worthy of a 0% tip.",

The chicken dish was lukewarm and the shrimp didn't have enough sauce leaving it dry. I waited about 15 min for my bill and again no server.

It recently undergone renovation in another area of the casino which made it way better. It is now more spacious with more tables and chairs. The interior looks extremely nice - modernized and brightly lit. I noticed that they started using a tablet to take orders which is a pretty neat transition. You can come here during lunch time for some yummy dim sum or visit during dinner time for authentic Chinese dishes. My family loves to come here all the day and it's reasonably priced for the food. The service was really nice especially since the host always made sure everything was okay and if we needed anything else. The food also comes out quick. There's A LOT to choose from in the menu.

And when we talked about it with the cashier , they denied it ! Hehe, what a excellent service ! Damn. Never go again! The waitress are very aggressive and tried to sell you everything.

It's definitely allot more than Arizona Dimsum. Located inside Golden Coast Hotel & Casino the restaurant itself is very nice. We came here on a Sunday around 11am and there wasn't any wait. Got seated right away and the food cart started coming. Order some basic dishes like Shumai and Hagow. Then we saw some dished that looked very different and good so we gave those a try (see pictures for details). I would say the dimsum here is quite good and the cart does go around often. But maybe it's a weekend so food options maybe more than week days.   Service was basic. They come and you choose your dish. Although they seem to treat the Cantonese speaker a little better than the English speaker. I'll be back to fully try other dishes on the menu.",

I also enjoyed the mushroom stuffed tofu with corn and other veggies.  The flavors were infused into the tofu and the entire bite was so juicy.  They also have the notorious Portuguese egg tarts.  Chicken feet were a family favorite.    A couple dishes werent really for our tastes such as the shumai and pineapple pastry.  I think the comparison to traditional pineapple cakes was the cause of this, but overall the flavor was like a puff pastry donut filled with the usual pineapple filling you would find in a pineapple cake.    Some additional things to consider: the prices are slightly higher and there is usually a wait, as such with other popular dim sum spots.  Overall cleanliness and service was very good and worth your money.",

It is open late, too, which is nice. I can't give you my take on many of the menu selections, as I have only had a couple of items.  But they are so good I keep going back to them. 1)  The Hot and Sour soup.  This comes out in a huge bowl.  Plenty enough for two, possibly even three people.  It is full of good stuff and a fairly dense soup.  So good. 2)  The shrimp fried rice.  The SFR that you get at Ping Pang Pong is quite different from anything I have had....the rice is very light and fluffy, not oily.  The shrimp are good size, not baby shrimp that you see at many places.  I am usually there with my Dad and we leave nothing in the pan. We all know that great food can be ruined with poor service, but that is certainly not the case here.  The service is impeccable.  They are quick to greet you and get drinks, and the food arrives in a reasonable amount of time.  Like many large Asian restaurants, they use the team approach to serving which makes them more efficient.  A True 5-star in my opinion..",

I know, I know, it's not the fanciest property you've ever seen, but it's definitely worth a visit.   First off, the food was good but the service was hit & miss. Stood at the front for a few minutes before being acknowledged even though there were 3 staff members standing there talking amongst each other (seemingly busy but who knows).  Anywho, once seated the service was only a little better. A few times the carts passed without stopping lol. Kind of awkward having to flag them down every time you want something, especially with this style of dinner service.   On to the food. Great options, yet they didn't have everything I was looking for. Started off with a hot pot of tea and the Chinese broccoli. Cooked perfectly, as was the brisket stew rice noodle (amazingly tender). Then we ordered the roasted duck, pan fried dumplings and s&p shrimp which were pretty good. The fried rice was on the sweet side, I'm not sure I'd order that again. The har gow, meh. Overall, the Chinese broccoli, brisket stew and pan fried dumplings were my favorite. I'll probably stick to those next time and sample some of the pork buns too.   *Extra points for ambiance and staying open late. Don't forget to check the hours before you go.",

The restaurant offers a menu of items.  And they also have fresh dim sum.  My mom said that if you go early like lunch you will get to try everything. By the evening hours they start to run out of some items.  Since I have moved to Texas I have had great dim sum in a long while. Every item that I ask for from the cart was very tasty.  We ate family style.   I loved the coconut filled buns.  I haven't had that those in 12 years+.   Anyways I don't know what the names of the items we ordered off the cart but the ladies make stop every few minutes to offer their fresh choices.  I can't wait to bring my children here when we visit as a family.    Stars 1 star for food 1 star for service 1 star for facilities 1 star for overall experience.",

There were 6 people in my party and we were sat at a table that had only 5 chairs and 4 sets of utensils. We saw our waiver maybe twice during our entire time, and the restaurant appeared to need more cleaning. I saw other parties around us also complaining from the lack of attention.

After ordering our food, the Honey walnut prawns and the Pork chops were both delivered in 5 minutes. It made me feel we were at a buffet because the food was luke warm and saturated in oil. I could tell it was precooked and under a warmer unit before we got it. We waited 20 minutes before the remainder of our order was delivered. That's a long time not to have rice with our main course. The fried rice was oily and so was the noodles. The noodles seemed like it was not cooked in HOT oil, instead it was saturated with oil. The Ong Choy was on point and delicious. I hope they return to fresh, cooked to order like a restaurant should of this caliber. We were disappointed and would not recommend to eat here for quality cantonese food.",

I've been here many times since they opened the spot in the middle of the Gold Coast and have always been blown away by the consistency of the food I have ordered.   The restaurant is typically busy - so the place is full and there is often a line outside the door. The hostesses dress in nice red Chinese dresses and seat you quickly.   Most of the dinners are between $15 -$20. They also have a page of market price items for fresh live seafood.   The wait staff is quick to take your order and then the food runners will bring your food. Yinnie is my favorite waitress. She is delightful and speaks great English. She has a unique way of using 2 spoons as chopsticks to box up your leftovers.   Noodles and rice dishes dominate - but there are plenty of protein items to choose from. I can't recommend the dim sum during the morning hours - although the restaurant is always packed. There are far too many carts making their way through the place and sometimes you see a cart parked for 15 minutes or so while the food runner takes a break. So - much lower rating for their dim sum service even though the food is great.",

The staff is awesome!  They're all attentive and polite, especially the manager Kristy, she's absolutely exceptional.  She's always checking up to make sure that I'm happy with my dinner. I'd take my friends and family here every time we want Chinese food.",

    "text": "Wow, probably one of the best dim sum restaurants in Vegas! This restaurant is located inside a hotel. We tried to call and make reservations beforehand because some of the reviews talked about having to wait a long time. However they only accept reservations for parties of 10 or more. For a group of 3, we only had to wait about 10 minutes on a Sunday afternoon.  The interior of the restaurant is clean, spacious, and looks new. Once we got seated, there were immediately 3 carts that came by, so we were able to get food right away. The carts consistently came by our table so we never had to chase anyone down for food. Tea is $1 per person. The food is great here, however the dishes are a little bit more expensive for dim sum. For example, we got a plate of egg tarts which cost $4.88 per plate. And the egg tarts had 2 per plate instead of 3. Overall, I highly recommend this dim sum restaurant if you don't mind spending a little more!",

I then asked the manager should we seat ourselves she said no and then a couple mins later someone came to seat us.    Once seated the busboy brought our beverages quickly but then had to wait for the server to come over took 10 minutes.   The appetizer we ordered came out quick, but the rest of our food took over 25 minutes to come out.. server had to many tables in her section.    yes this is a high volume restaurant but staff for it. stop cutting corners to make more money. more staff = better service   The food is awesome just bad service.",

After a while we decided to walk over to the Gold Coast and try their buffet. While walking over I noticed the sign for Ping Pang Pong's and I remember seeing great reviews for the place. My husband was excited because he had been in the mood for Chinese food.   After arriving at the restaurant and being seated the server came and took our order. Mind you there were only 4 of us and we decided on just a few items: The Kung Pao Chicken, Beef and Broccoli and fried rice. After we placed our order we were brought the waters that we requested. An hour later we still did not have our food. We tried a number of times to flag down our server or anyone that could tell us what was up with our food...we were basically ignored.   We ended up just getting up and walking out....  So I can't really give a review on the food but their service get's an all time low for me.",

They don't care to know who you are, they just want to serve good food at a good price and get you the hell out.  I love it!  Walk in and find the cashier. She will show you to a clean table without even saying anything. The server assistant will come around and ask if you want a beverage. Tip: don't order the wine. It's served from a twist cap single serving 6 pack. My friend almost threw up. HAHA. The server comes by and asks if we're ready to order. We were. The food came out about 10 minutes later, if that.  The food is shareable so be careful how much you order. One plate of rice is good for 4 people and two entrees is good for 4 people. I looked at the cooks to notice none of them talking, they were just busting out the food. The server checked on us once and then asked if we wanted to go boxes. They brought them over, boxed up the food and we paid.  If you go to an Asian restaurant and it's full of Asians then they must be doing something right. This place is full of them.",

    "text": "The BF had a craving for late night dim sum and so I went on a search to find who serves even a small selection throughout the day.   It's not on the dinner menu, but I was told you can order dimsum from the kitchen late night for $2.88 each. The selection is limited and depends on what didn't sell that morning. Hey, it's better than nothing....the only late night dimsum (Kan's) closed.   We ended up getting:  Shrimp Har Gao- the shrimp and wrapper was fine, but I think the wrapper is slightly too thick. Shumai- I did not like their version. Something about the taste just doesn't work for me and was just OK.  Shrimp cake- these were tasty. They were panfried so it was crisp and inside was dense cake, shrimp and green onion.   We also got off the menu:  Mapo Tofu ($7.95)- pretty good. The meat had a sausage like flavor to it which was interesting since most just throw plain ground meat. Tofu is always noms to me.  Salt&Pepper Pork Chop ($9.95)- the fry was light so the texture was nice. Funny that \"salt\" is part of the name, but it needed a tad more of that.   I was surprised by the prices. I honestly thought it would be more at a casino, but it's about the same pricing as some of the nicer Chinese restaurant on Spring Mountain Rd. I think it was very fair priced and the quality was good.   The service was friendly and pretty on it with drinks and checking up on us.   Will be coming back for daytime dimsum....one of these days we'll actually wake up early enough for it.",

It's not close to the best Chinese food I've had.  It's a bit greasy, at times overcooked, and occasionally a bit bland.  We sampled some meat dishes, vegetable dishes, and even some dim sum.  This left me wondering how this place gets such raves.  One thing, they serve some exotic dishes, dishes I don't see in other places.  I suspect this is one of the attractions.  The service is fine.  The place is often busy, and they do their best to hustle people in and out.  Overall, the place is a \"a-ok\", 3 stars.",

    "text": "Sad to say, this is the best dim sum in Vegas.  I miss Seattle!  I have to tell ya -- the service (or lack of service) is why I gave this a \"3 star\".  The hostess is cute but she is completely an idiot!  Every 5 minutes while my mom and I waited in line, she would ask, \"How many?\"  I'm not kidding you -- There were only 4 of us in line (a couple ahead of us) -- and you'd think she would recognize four people, right?!  NOT!  Every 5 minutes, she'd ask, \"How many?\"   (Am I on \"Seinfeld\" or a candid camera?)  There were only 4 of us in line, and the hostess asked the couple ahead of us, \"How many?\"  They replied, \"2\" ... and then she turned to us and asked, \"How many? 4?\"  -- um,  helllooooooooooooooooo!!!!  My 3 year old niece can add better than her!  Anyway -- long story short, after 3 more times of \"how many?\" -- I finally lost my temper.  It's truly sad because the food is quite yummy -- it's just that the idiot hostess needs to get fired!  The funniest thing is, while I was enjoying my siew mai and har gow with mom, the idiot hostess sat a couple next to us.  Sure enough, the couple yelled at the hostess for her stupidity.  Wow!  I hope when I return, I don't have to answer to \"How Many?\"  10 times again.  LOL...",

    "text": "I would like to say, I am not very picky about service. I am Asian and I eat at restaurants mostly for the food. So service and ambiance are just plusses for me, not a breaking point. BUT I HATE PING PANG PONG! I shrugged off the name and got ready with my friends to eat some recommended dim sum. It was in the middle of a casino, so it was extremely noisy and it smelled like cigarette smoke, but again, I was willing to overlook it for some good dim sum. First, there is no clear set way for me to get a table. At a typical dim sum place, you go up to a hostess, and you get a number, so I get ready to go up to the hostess, but there is a line blocked off in front of her. So I go and wait in line, the line does not move an inch for 20 minutes. So I think I must get a number and then stand in line. I approach the hostess again, and ask her politely in Cantonese, could I get a number for a table of 6. She proceeds to b*tch at me and say that I need to stand in line, so I start to walk away, and then she goes wait do you have a number, and I said no so she haughtily hands me the number. Completely un-phased, I ask how long would the wait be, she looks at me incredulously, like I am some sort of infant, and rudely tells me this place is very busy and there is no possible way for her to even approximate a wait and could I stand aside I was blocking her table. I hear people all around me asking the same question and everyone getting the same crappy answer to the point all, but two tables stayed to wait. Being a b*tch is inexcusable. I have eaten dim sum in Hong Kong where people get up and line up in front of the carts for dim sum and its the way it is over there. This place seemed to be conflicted whether or not it wanted to be a free-for-all or a place that carefully lines up and due to this confusion, NO ONE was getting served.",

    "text": "ok first of all... lets just start out by saying I am from LA... and lucky for me we have Chinatown and the entire San Gabriel Valley a.k.a. China! Now maybe Vegas just doesn't have too many authentic chinese restaurants but damn this was the worst dim sum I have ever had in my life! My friend took me there 2 weeks ago and well the name kinda threw me off to begin with but once I tried the shu mai... damn it was over! I didnt want to try anything else. The simplest dim sum and yet they couldnt even get it right. The beefballs were too overcooked too!  Even the tiny little pork buns were to run from. How does this place stay in business? But then again maybe they are catering to a different crowd. What really struck me as weird was the fact the place was full of asians! I mean, is this suppose to be as good as it gets in Vegas for dim sum? If so, I'd rather stop by a trader joes and pick up a pack of frozen shu mais. You will have much better luck going to the frozen food aisle at a supermarket for good dim sum. Oh one more thing.. horrible service. The employees are literally fresh off the boat! I guess thats the only thing authentic about this place, their workers! hahahaha Trust me when I say I will never come back here or recommend this to another soul.. unless i hated them and wanted to waste their money! =D",

PING PANG PONG! i love saying that name!! LOL hahahahhaha! OH! 1 more thing... they are open until 3am!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!",

I wish I'd arrived earlier, say at 10 AM when they open, because I had to wait, and it was a little bit busy for my tastes.  Service was okay, although I had to flag down a waitress or wave over a cart lady a couple of times.  The porridge with shredded pork and thousand-year-egg was superb--light, fresh and like no porridge I'd eaten to date.  I also had shrimp in rice noodle roll (slightly spicy, and there was plenty of pepper sauce on the table to turn up the heat as desired) and custard buns--silky, rich yellow egg custard just barely sweeter than the dough (I have this thing against eating once I'm full), and wished I could have tried everything.  If those aren't the most imaginative choices, take heart; I'm slowly working my way through all the dim sum offerings in Las Vegas.  I simply order whatever I see first.  So far I've tried Harbor Palace and now Ping Pang Pong--I think that Ping Pang Pong is the better of the two.",

Take a minute and watch the cooks do their thing it's amazing. At Ping Pang Pong you can relax and feel at home even though you are surrounded by a full house of hungry people. The nice part is the staff will bend over backwards to make sure your food and dining is just the way you would expect. If you have any special needs just ask for Krysty she will get it done. Oh don't forget about the fresh squeezed juices from the juice bar. Thanks so much!",

We stopped by on a Sunday around 5pm to have a light dinner. Inexplicably, even though the restaurant was basically empty, we had to wait 15 minutes or so before being seated. Not a huge deal, just would have been nice to understand why.  The decor is very nice. The service is barely friendly, but adequate.  We ordered some dim sum (they have a smaller selection to choose from for dinner) and a Wonton Noodle Soup. The dim sum (Chinese Sausage Roll, Shrimp Dumplings, Shrimp Chive Dumplings, Mango Pudding, and Macanese Egg Tarts) were all quite tasty. The Wonton Noodle Soup was definitely above average.  It's a slightly above average place to have some dim sum and/or Chinese food.",

My husband and I decided, after we ordered of course, that we should have shared a meal! You'll definitely get your money's worth. On the way in, I heard someone say, \"I hope you're hungry\" to another person who was in line. Now I know what he meant by that. We went during the lunch rush and the line was very long, but we wweee seated pretty quickly considering  how long the line was.   The appetizers and single portion items are carted around to each table. My husband wasn't a fan of one of the items, and I'm not even sure what it was. It was some type of meat wrapped in cabbage. We also had sweet bread. If we had more time here, I would definitely visit again, especially now that I know what to expect, and the flow of things.",

A lot. (Don't judge lol)... =P  So they have moved locations since my last review, and it is now more central in the casino. Their decor is nice and updated. Also, they have greatly improved their service. They are a lot faster and efficient, even when busy. The food quality is still great like it has always been... my favorite dishes are the roast duck, honey walnut shrimp, and salted fish and chicken fried rice. Dim sum was good for the rare times I am awake early enough to partake.  But this restaurant has always been a reliable late-night, post-clubbing, post-gambling treat that I chose to bring out-of-towners arriving late who are looking for some quick yummy chinese food. Open til 3AM and easy to find? What's not to like? :)",

    "text": "I travel quite a bit to Hong Kong so I have a high expectation when it comes to dim sum. So far, I like this place best compared to other places in town.   Location: inside the Gold Coast casino. Parking is free and easy. The only drawbacks about being inside the casino is since this is an old casino, I feel like the air is not well circulated. For that, I'd give 3 out of 5 stars.   Decor: They finished with the renovation couple months ago. The new place is next to the old one. It's bigger, brighter and more tables. They also have couple booth on the side wall. There is a section in the back to accomodate big parties. Overall, I like the new decor.   Food: They have shiu may, shrimp dumpling, congee, etc. We started with Crysanthemum flower tea for drinks. For the food, we ordered salt and pepper crispy tofu, lobster ball, chicken feet, sponge cake, special hearty chicken soup and sweet tofu for desert. I thought everything was delicious and tasty, except for the congee. The congee was watery today. I also wish they have a lot more unique dim sum dishes like in HK. One thing to point out, they are now offer fresh fruit and vegetables pressed juice which I love! I'd give 4 out of 5 stars.   Service is a 5 stars. They refilled our drinks and always checked on us, made sure we had enough food. They also made sure dirty plates were picked up timely so we had room for our upcoming dishes.   Price: Their prices are reasonable. Even though they are located inside the casino, they are not expensive. I'd give 4 out of 5 stars. It was 4 of us and we spent below $50 before tips.   I think dim sum place in Vegas can be improved. Especially in Vegas where we have so many casino high roller from Asia, there should be more options. But I like this place and the price are pretty good so I would definitely come back again!",

    "text": "Finally got a chance to visit after Ping Pang Pong's move within Gold Coast. I always thought the food here was good, but my big complaints about the old location were the terrible service and the invasive cigarette smoke that used to get drawn into the old restaurant. The new location of the restaurant seems to have mitigated both problems, as the tables are now set back much further from the casino floor and the better \"flow\" of the floor layout means that the servers can move around more easily and thus more quickly.  I also thought the servers were friendlier than before, but tough to draw a conclusion from just one visit. I'll update my review after some more visits and if the service remains improved, I think this could be a 5*.  As I mentioned, I always thought the food here was top notch and that hasn't changed. I did try one new dish, the jellyfish and roast duck with asparagus stir-fry in xo sauce, and that was killer. Old staples like the dragon well shrimp, lamb stew hotpot, and XO calamari with lotus root are exactly the same as I remember.  IMO Ping Pang Pong also is the best dim sum place currently open in Vegas.",

I had tea and wife had soda, they came back seversl times to refill her soda without being asked. Ladies with the carts can be a little pushy, but there just doing their job. Price has increased but still worth it. About $47.00 for the 2 of us, it used to be one of the  cheaper places to get dim sum in Las Vegas. Inside Gold Coast Casino on Flamingo.",

The new location inside the Gold Coast Hotel & Casino is definitely an upgrade with higher ceilings and apparently double the space of previous location.  Seems like the move eliminates the long lines of people waiting for a table.  Best dim sum in Las Vegas with fresh food served via tableside carts including the shrimp har gow and pork shumai...standards at dim sum.  Don't get seated in the big dining room with carpet because the carts aren't able to move in there which made it quite annoying to walk to the carts to pick food out.    I recommend ordering from the menu for dinner since dim sum ends around 3 pm.  All dishes are very flavorful and authentic, mostly Cantonese in my opinion.  Must try include the lamb chop appetizer, egg white fried rice, salt and pepper pork chops, green beans with XO sauce.  These are just a few recommendations but the menu has a dish for every palette!",

    "text": "We came here for the dim sum, and it definitely did not disappoint. There was great variety to choose from and the food tasted great. If I was rating on food alone, it would be more likely 4 stars. However, what really detracted was the poor service.  My mom and I arrived first and we waited about 10 minutes in line when there was clearly plenty of empty seats. I got annoyed after I watched small groups of people bypass us in the line, walk straight to the hostess, and got seated before us. Whatever though, we eventually got in, and then had to wait another 10 minutes for our server to get to our table and set us up with silverware. We waited another 5 minutes until I was able to flag another server down and ask for drinks, and yet another 5 minutes for the dim sum carts to finally come our direction. I don't know, maybe it was the late afternoon and I was just hangry, but I was annoyed at the long wait for everything.  I wish that there was a menu available that we could look for reference as to what the different dishes were and what the price ranges were. The servers were abrupt when we asked what the dishes were, as if, come on, we're in dim sum territory, we should know what the hell we're doing. I felt that the servers took advantage of the fact that we weren't familiar with the language and the cuisine so they kept trying to ply us with every dish on their carts. I felt bad after having to say no very loudly multiple times, but I wasn't about to rack up a ridiculous bill!  Even then, after looking over the bill, I was annoyed that they charged for the tea!   Like I said, dim sum was good, but customer service was absolutely horrid, hence the 3 stars. Thankfully I'm only visiting family, but I won't waste my time coming back here in my return trips.",

It was not busy at all, but besides getting our water very fast, nobody came by to take our order. My mom went to the front to get the attention of the hostess. She was very kind and took our order. We got three dishes. Two were very average. The third dish was absolutely disgusting, and this is not an opinion. The pork chops and black pepper beef were okay. The pork belly was awful. The cook didn't even slice the meat against the grain which made it super dry and tough. The sauce it was cooked in was way too sweet. We couldn't even eat it.",

My Hong Kong-hailing real estate agent was visibly horrified when he found out in casual conversation that my parents and I had not yet been privy to the local dim sum experience at Ping Pang Pong (how is anyone supposed to take me seriously when I say this aloud?) in the Gold Coast casino. So while showing us detailed French doors, luxurious hardwood flooring, and expansive high ceilings, he kept peppering home features with \"shao mai\" and \"cha shao bao.\" I was sold - on the food, not the house - so not long after that, it was off to Gold Coast we went.   The casino is not the most convenient to navigate, but the restaurant sits pretty much smack dab in the middle of it, and that's where my biggest issue with it lay. The restaurant is open to the casino pits with hip-level pillars that whisper, \"Smoky Smokerson! Enter, please.\" On the flip side, however, the dim sum is solid. Every dish we hailed off the cart was well-prepared and got a stamp of approval. The xia jiao, chicken feet, congee - all good in the hood. It's just that this hood carries a bit of an eau de FUMAR!",

So a lot of the food I normally eat, they don't have.   Their portion is smaller as well. As in, most places give you 3 egg tarts and this place gives you 2. Same for other dishes like the rice wrapped with leaves.   Compared to DJ Dim Sum in Rio, this place has a major thumbs down in food and in service for sure. Don't think I'll ever come back.",

We've had to eat the half roast duck instead (also tasty), Kung Pao Chicken (yes I'm dating a white guy ;) We've had pretty good service everytime we've been here and also manage to get a table straight away. Most of the time we eat between 12 and 3am so they usually run out of the crispy chicken by then. Once we came at 7pm and the crispy chicken came out 5 minutes after we ordered it but it wasn't even crispy. The other 3 times it's been great. We like it spicy.   Dishes we don't like: hot and sour soup. It's not hot or sour... Just big. Wrinkly string beans - sounds exactly like what it is - wrinkly string beans, not the yummiest vege choice!   Dishes that are average: won ton noodle soup - it's also massive and has lots of veges, chicken feet - flavour is ok.   Dishes that we like - crispy chicken, pepper beef medallions,roast duck, Kung Pao chicken, Singapore noodles, prawn dumplings, Chinese brocolli.   Will we be back?  Yes!",

It is all about getting well rounded flavors and plenty of food. Their razor clams and scallops on the half shell are a steal. At $8 for four and two respectively is a steal. I could eat those all night. Just be warned that your breath will be kicking. So much fried garlic goes on top of both dishes.   PPP is a hit or miss. The green tea smoked duck was not something we enjoyed. I ended up just wanting Peking duck and was sad to see that they don't offer it. The sweet and pungent lotus roots are always a must. Add that with the three dishes I list above and you don't really need anything else.   The dim sum here is good. It is just pricey compared to other places.   Just be prepared. Don't expect great service. Just know something might go wrong during the meal and just move on. The food is good.",

I've lived in Los Angeles for 15 years and I am telling you this is a really good dim sum place but you have to come here early. You have to come here before noon time (they open at 10am) to have most fresh and tasty dim sum. My fav dishes are sausage bao, custard tarts, porridge, pearl rice balls,har gow,scallions and chicken feet.  The only reason can bring me to gold coast hotel is having dim sum at Ping Pang Pong and hot pot at Noodle Exchange. Otherwise I would never step into this hotel because the environment. However I keep coming back here for food twice a month. Now you can figure out how much I enjoy their food :)",

Another example of waitress Ellie's inattentiveness (she didn't seem overly busy) was my iced tea glass would sit empty for about 5 minutes before she or someone else would refill it.  Chinese restaurants aren't exactly known for their great customer service.  I guess that's part of the authenticity of this place.  Another thing that I though was nice is that unlike many Chinese restaurants here in the US, this place didn't go overboard with all the Chinese artwork & other nicnacks that most Chinese restaurants feel obligated to put up.

There were plenty of carts full of food being pushed around the entire time we were there. We ordered the full gamut of dim sum dishes and all were full of flavor. The shrimp and chive dumpling was the best I've ever had. The shrimp was plump and fresh. The fried dumpling (hom sui gok?) was so tasty and not greasy like many of the other ones I've had. I didn't eat it but the only dish that I heard was was not a hit was the jelly fish.  Prices were reasonable, especially for a casino.   They also have a full cook to order menu but I didn't get to try anything off the menu. Maybe next time.",

Rice 3 types, all the same- dry and boring. Pork belly was dried out. Chicken hot pot again bland and no taste. The only thing excellent is the war wonton soup. The spring rolls bland and very greasy. Satay beef tasted like Panda Express! Pork buns were dried out. Hardly any shredded pork inside.  The Noodle Exchange in the Gold Coast is owned by Ping Pang Pong. Same bland food. Not sure what all the fuss is over the dim sum. Way over priced and the wait service is horrible. Won't go back!!!!!",

This Chinese restaurant was excellent and reminded of the Chinese restaurants back home in Hawaii. Excellent tasting food with good portions. We shared between 5 people 5 dishes and we were all stuffed after we were done. The Chinese tea was too light in flavor for me, but the 2nd pot brought out tasted better. We met family from Hawaii for dinner. Everyone loved the food. Well done! My husband is hard to please, local Hawaiian boy, he is so picky and he can't wait to go back. SO the food is GOOD!  And the service was well done as well. The service team worked together as a team to take care of us.",

    "text": "Talk about a popular dim sum place! My family has loved this restaurant for a few years, but this was my first time trying it, so I was excited. We tried to get here by 9:45am so we could get in for the first seating at 10, but unfortunately we missed it so needed to wait 45 min or so as groups started to leave. And there continued to be a long line.   Haha, I'm impressed by the efficient design! The tables are arranged in a circle so that carts can go around to the tables and then replenish at the kitchen. Unfortunately since we were at the beginning of the second seating, there weren't many items we often like (chicken feet, har gao, siu mai) since they ran out. Fortunately, we got them as we were finishing up.  I really enjoyed something that seemed like shrimp tempura wrapped in funn. It was delicious! I also liked the eggplant shrimp (generous amount of shrimp inside) and roast pork. I also love gailan, and I appreciated that the sauce was on the side so I could control how salty I wanted it.  The baked char siu bao could've been softer, though, and filled with more meat. The butter buns were filled with lots of butter, though they could have been warmer and softer.  The service was generally good and some of the servers even smiled. If you're family with dim sum restaurants, you know that's rare.  I enjoyed Ping Pang Pong and would return again. Most of the customers were Chinese and other Asian, so you know the experience is really Chinese!",

We were disappointed about that but the dim sum did have was really good. I recommend the baked Bbq pork bun. The bun was flaky and fresh out of the oven.   Since most of our dim sum favorites were not on the dinner menu, we ended up getting the walnut shrimp and the yang chow fried rice. Both were really good and we left happy.",

The name sounds like a game of Ping-Pong with an odd tongue twister word in between, or a slang way to call a Ping-Pong ball in Cantonese.  If you park on the southwest side, you can access the restaurant quicker.  They are the second closest place you can get \"edible\" Dim Sum from the Strip area.  I visited here for Dim Sum on multiple occasions, and the quality was decent relative to everything else in town.  Selection seems limited though when compared with other Dim Sum joints.  Price was somewhere in between the residential area and the one next door.     Dinner was meh, everything seems a little off on the flavor, we got a few seafood dishes, tofu pots, and beef chow fun.  The food came out very slowly and their seasoning left you with a bad after taste in your mouth.  Not sure if I will be back when there are so many other opinions in town, and service was not the best either, they got the same poker face servers you see in most Asian restaurants...",

Yes it's inside a the Gold Coast Casino and it's a hike (keep that in mind if you have older dim sum guests with you). We arrived later than we normally do for Dim sum so I really think our choices of the little bites of food were limited. They close at 3:00 pm and the last rounds of food were the repeated rounds. Nothing new was added. We asked for a new dish and it would be a 15-20 minute wait, so note to self arrive at the usual time to receive the grand selection of dim sum.  Yes we will visit this dim sum restaurant again, but around noon next time.",

We had buns with BBQ pork inside along with calamari, two kinds of dumplings and roasted pork. Everything was really tasty and it all came out to roughly $30.

It was pretty busy when we went but didn't seem overcrowded like in most Dim Sum restaurants.  The food at PPP is decent. We had the dim sum staples like Har Gow, Shaomai, Beef Balls and fried shrimp balls. Nothing really stood out from the dishes we had. In addition there didn't seem to be too much variety in the dishes. We had asked the servers if the Chinese Broccoli and Sesame Balls were coming out and they said soon. 3 passes later with the carts and those 2 dishes were MIA. And this is at 12 during the middle of lunch? I didn't get it.   One other thing that was a turn off is the fact that it is located in the casino and is open where you are exposed to the smoke lingering from the casino.  I have to say that I was a little disappointed after eating here. I had heard such good reviews on it but in the end I would have rather have eaten at Orchids Garden. It was a nice change but I would have to say that I will not be back.",

Thus, I was excited to finally try this place out.  However, it certainly did not live up to their hype.  Ping Pang Pong is located in the Gold Coast Hotel & Casino.  They serve dim sum from 10am to 3pm and reopen for dinner from 5pm to 3am.  We were able to catch dinner last Sunday.  Wait time was not bad at all.  However, service was not the best.  It was such a hassle to ask for anything besides placing our order.  We ended up ordering fried flounder fish, snow pea leaves with roasted garlic, and the satay beef with enoki mushrooms and pineapple.  Every thing was served family-style and arrived fairly quickly.  The fried flounder and pea leaves are things they always order.  It does not have strong flavors, but when paired with the dipping sauce it certainly hits the spot for a good home-cooked meal.  The satay beef, however, was beyond greasy.  I swear eating it can cause bad heartburns.  This place is definitely not a must when visiting Vegas, but not bad if you are in the area and want authentic Chinese food.",

Recently relocated next door inside the Gold Coast casino, the restaurant underwent some remodeling and the decor looks inviting. Service was expedient but someone unfamiliar with the Chinese culture might find it annoying as servers keep rolling their dim sum carts repeatedly and ask you to order.

    "text": "Maybe more like 4.25.  It did win some kind of top 10 award for Chinese Restaurants in T + L magazine but other than dim sum, I haven't been to PPP for their regular menu for quite some time.   About 4 or 5 years ago, my sister swore by this place for decent Chinese food. Now it has a lot of competition. So basically, I'm just reviewing their dim sum service.  I had to explain to my husband the difference between AUTHENTIC Chinese food and Chinese food. I've learned that some (not all) that call Panda Express and PF Changs Chinese food may not like AUTHENTIC Chinese food. They are not one and the same.  There is a definite difference in quality compared to other favorite dim sum joints I've been too. PPP is hot & fresh and definitely tasty. I must emphasize HOT because that's the biggest blow for dim sum lovers - cold food! I wouldn't recommend it for 1st time dim summers though unless you speak fluent Chinese. I'm half Asian and can decipher a lot of broken English, but I've had a very difficult time figuring out what the cart ladies say is on their cart. My husband and I are not as adventurous, so we are the types that want to know what we are eating before we eat it....  But once you can identify a food by looking at it, PPP is definitely on the higher end of the spectrum for taste and quality. Their shrimp dumplings for example - are probably the best I've had and when you think about a simple dumpling is made - you have to admire that somewhere in the process, PPP does something spectacular.  The shrimp balls, shumai, pork buns, sticky pork buns - all have a little extra something that sets them above the rest.  The restaurant itself is quaint. You can see the kitchen from your table, and the a lot of what, in most places, is normally behind closed doors. Goldcoast is not the most glamorous of casinos... and the restaurant itself is still a good ways from the parking garage. But if you don't mind walking through the casino and the smoke that comes with it, the location may work for you.   Plus, if you are a dim sum for breakfast person like me, they do open a bit earlier than a lot places around town 10:00am.  So if you enjoy dim sum, PPP is definitely a must-have on you're list. You just have to, even if it's once.",

The chicken fried rice had a different flavor and wasn't a bad thing. The Mongolian beef was a bit salty for my taste but it wasn't that over powering. The fried calamari was probably my favorite dish. The wonton soup was just as good. The portions are pretty large so choose wisely. My complaint about this place was service. Servers weren't attentive and it took forever to get refills and what not. But the food did come out pretty quick and they're open til 3am.

Our group was really big, we took about 8 tables and it was never a moment where there was not any dim sum on our table. The servers did phenomenal job in providing a vast amount of dishes to our table and to the rest of the tables.First time at this dim sum location in Vegas and it is definitely one of the top choices in Vegas to eat great dim sum.",

    "text": "PINGing with excitement, we were thrilled to try out some dim sum while in Vegas. We ate here with some friends that had lived in Vegas and said this was one of the best places for dim sum. We arrived here around noon, and there was a bit of a wait, since there is limited space in the restaurant, especially for large parties of more than 4. Ignoring our PANGs of hunger, we waited patiently. It probably took us about 20-30 minutes to get seated.   While the selection is more limited than other dim sum restaurants, they do you have your standard dim sum items like shu mai, sticky rice in lotus leaf, fried taro cake, chicken feet, spare ribs, congee, and bao.   The items were hot, and fresh tasting. The carts went by at a decent rate, but we were warned that you should get any items you wanted while the cart was there, since you might not see that cart again. Prices were a bit high compared to other restaurants I've eaten at (3-4 dollars per item average), but that was to be expected for dim sum in a Vegas casino.  Service was a bit spotty, but to be expected since the restaurant was filled to capacity with hungry diners. Waiters were buzzing back and forth, like a ball in a PONG game, filling water, getting more tea, and getting people's checks.  So if you're hungry for dim sum, this restaurant is a good choice. If you are with a larger party though, it helps to come here before noon when it's less crowded.",

Order before u get there & remember the ticket number (Chinese food plus a memory test at the same time)  The get:  plenty of food 1. pork filled potstickers x7 - huge size & good with tasty dipping sauce $7.95  2.  classic Cantonese beef tendon brisket stew aaaahh can't go wrong with nice beefy tendon $13.95  3.  orange chicken - well this hits the spot $12.95  4.  mandarin beef filet - comes on a bed of white onions so u get some veggies & again done just right  $16.95  Overall, this is Chinese food executed as well or better than most places.  Even though it's in a casino, don't let that deter you from grabbing & going.  1 dish is plenty for 2 persons unless you want more variety or just are super hungry.  Then get a minimum of 2 dishes which reheats well for later or in 2 hours if you feel hungry again.",

It gets busy fast and people are waiting as soon as it opens.  Good quality. Lots of variety. Flavors are good but also what you expect.   The cart attendants are friendly enough. If there is something you are looking for make sure you ask a dining room manager.  About what you expect for value for dim sum but not outrageous. They can accommodate big groups too.",

I was kinda skeptical because the restaurant was located in a hotel and didn't seem very authentic but it was actually really good! We came Sunday during lunch and there was NO WAIT which is basically unheard of for dim sum even more so in Vegas. It's cart style Dim sum which is the best and only way to go. Prices were fair we paid about $120 after tax and tip for 4 people. We ordered A LOT of food lol. Service was above average for a dim sum restaurant. They came around pretty often so I didn't feel like I had to wait so long in between. I will definitely be back!",

It is located within the Gold Coast Hotel and Casino on Flamingo Blvd.  It is a new location within the casino which allows them to have more customers at once.   This recent visit, there was a line to get in, but it moved pretty quick as we were going there for lunch.  They have items you can order ala carte, but dim sum is what we came for.  The carts didn't come around as fast they usually do, but I think it was because they were kinda busy that day.  If you don't know what it is on the cart, they will describe it to you and even show it to you.   The pork buns (or manapuas as we call them in Hawaii) were warm, soft and tasty.  The pork hash and shrimp drumsticks are very good and worth a return visit.   I would recommend getting there when they open for lunch and the turnover is faster to get a table.",

We were one of the first tables that arrived when they opened and to my disappointment, not all the dim sum items were out yet. Therefore, we had very few choices. The dim sum here was definitely more expensive ($4-$10), but it was delicious!   Um, I'm not a huge fan of the service. It all felt very passive aggressive and no one smiled. Our waitress had a RBF (resting bitch face) the whole time serving us.   Overall, It was a decent experience.",

    "text": "My wife, in laws (who are Taiwanese), my dad and my family came to eat dim sum here on Tuesday around 11am.  The first thing to know is that when I called to ask for the wait time, the host just said that lunch is served from 10a till 3pm and repeated it again when I asked to clarify my question.  When my wife called to ask this question about 1 hour later because of an unforeseen delay, she got the same response.  We both asked in English.  The authenticity factor just went up before even getting there.  Lots of again people were eating here which is a plus.  The dim sum is good.  I know there is a China Town here in Vegas but for something this accessible just off the strip, it's pretty good. They have a good variety. Everything is standard of what I would expect.  The food comes on carts and stays warm.  The red bean sesame ball was still warm when biting into it which was lovely.  They also had a savory Shanghai style pork bun.  I'd like it to have a bit more frying in the top but it was cooked well.  The minced pork in fried mochi could have had a little more pork.  The cha shu bao baked was great.  Sweetness with a stick bun filled with barbeque pork is baked well.  I've had bigger, but not at a dim sum place.  The kicker was dessert.  We had the doh hua, soft warm tofu in a ginger syrup.  The consistency should be soft and melt in your mouth.  It should just fall apart with the slightest pressure of your tongue.  They nail it here.  My father in law says this was the best since he was last in Taiwan.  It even prompted my mother in law to try some and she usually doesn't eat sweets.  She really liked it.  Like all dim sum, go with a party of at least 4 or you'll be full by the 4th dish.  Happy eating!!",

The lines were extremely long, and the majority of the people eating here are mainly Chinese.   The service was pretty phenomenal and the food was pretty good. When we wanted specific items the wait staff hurried along and grabbed it for us.   Tea was always refilled whenever we opened the pot lid and sauces were grabbed for us when requested.   Ha Gao: I liked this a lot. I thought their wrapper and their shrimp were really springy and delicious.   Sumai: they put some fish roe on it which I thought was nice.  Gai lan (Chinese broccoli): was nicely steamed or poached. I greatly enjoyed this.  Chinese Noodles wrapped Beef/Shrimp: The beef was amazingly delicious.   Fried Calamari: Needed a tad bit of salt but otherwise very good.  Fried Fish: This was one of our favorites, highly recommended! I think they were fried anchovies.   There was also a bunch of other stuff that I can't recall but I had a really good meal here.",

The staff was welcoming and decent. I had a party of about nine people but we all ordered small dishes to share. After eating we waited almost an hour to pay for our bill despite asking for it multiple times. After getting irritated we decided to pay up front.   So I ended up ordering a Lobster dish they had at market price to split and although I understood the price might be a little pricey I couldn't believe what they charged me for it.  A single Maine lobster stir fried in some ginger sauce.  Final cost. $136 for 1 dish.    This one dish cost more than everyone else' meals COMBINED at the table.  I was in disbelief but had to leave so we just paid and proceeded to leave.  But before we could leave, the waitress yells at us and says, \"no tip?!\"   Keep in mind we already left money on the table not including the money from everyone else.  This place is scammy and they know it.  Save your money and don't let this place hustle you.  Lesson learned.",

We had black peppered beef, shrimp fried rice, and dim sum. The dinner was very good, Our server was pleasant and patiently answered all our menu questions. If you're looking for a quite dining experience, this is not your cup of oriental tea. If you want a good meal in a loud and busy casino, try it. Next time in Vegas, we will dine here again.  Sept, 2015- Second meal: Had the King Du pork chops (get them boneless) and fried rice. A great meal...one of the best sweet and sour dishes we have ever had. This place is now one of our favorites. If just the two of you, one entree and rice will be as much as you want to eat.  9/4/2016 - The Spicy Orange Chicken is a show-stopper.  8/30/2017 - The remodel has improved the experience - and still the same great food. Had to take our guests to experience the \"Best Chinese Food In Vegas\".  After eating here half a dozen times, I have bumped the rating to a 5 based on consistently great food.  Mar. 2018- Can't pass up the Spicy Orange Chicken. Have eaten oriental food all over the country, and this place is the standard we use to judge by. Yeah it's loud and busy...yeah the service can be brusque, and yeah it's in an off-the-strip casino, but man, is the food good.",

    "text": "Not your average Chinese restaurant inside a casino in Las Vegas. Ping Pang Pong (I laugh a little every time I say it) is legit dim sum and a la carte Chinese dishes located inside the Gold Coast Casino.   We met friends who are regulars there and we really enjoyed our Sunday brunch. We ate siu mai, hargow, shredded pork dumplings, pork ribs in black bean sauce, sesame shrimp dumplings, house special fried rice and bbq pork buns. It was all good and I was surprised at how good the food was. I usually avoid eating Asian food inside a casino because it's usually a poor interpretation of the original cuisine but Ping Pang Pong is certainly the exception. Good, fresh dim sum served in carts the way they should be. There was a line to get seated but our friends were already there so we didnt have to wait, thankfully.   I really enjoyed all the things we had. They were mostly the typical things we order at dim sum restaurants we frequent in LA & SF except for the sesame shrimp dumplings and the shredded pork dumplings. Those 2 I havent had before and I really liked them both. The sesame shrimp one was little shrimps stuffed in rolled puff pastry. It was great. The shredded pork dumplings were like stuffed to the brim potstickers. They were tasty and were perfect with a soy sauce dip.  Service was friendly. We didnt feel rushed and our table was attended to at all times. Our drinks were refilled and anything we requested (chili sauce, lemon, etc) were brought to us rather quickly.   I highly recommend Ping Pang Pong when you're anywhere near the Gold Coast. Free parking and open til 3am!! What?!!",

This brightly lit restaurant will catch anyone's eyes when walking through Gold Coast Casino. For a party of 5 around 845pm Saturday night, we were seated within 10 minutes.   Maybe the carts only come around during lunch, but for dinner services, you order from the menu. We ordered family style to try a little bit of everything.   ----Entree---- Singapore noodles: a little too salty for me, but overall, great flavors. Beef flat noodles: saucy and soft pieces of beef. Delicious!  Three mushrooms: my favorite dish because of the shiitaki mushrooms. Calamari with lotus root in XO sauce: calamari is great, but I wasn't a fan of the lotus root. It's got the crunchy texture of a water chestnut, except it's bigger. Salt and pepper pork chop: just order this. It's so good! Crunchy texture on the outside and soft pork. Just be careful you don't chomp down on the bone thinking it's the crunchy layer......like me   ----Dim Sum---- Shu mai: oh it's the best I've had!  Chicken feet: it almost melts in your mouth. Then you gotta spit out the chicken bones. Har gow (shrimp dumpling): can't go wrong ordering these Steamed pork buns: these are my dessert when I eat dim sum!",

I ordered Haw gaw (shrimp dumplings) the shrimp was also mushy.. that means its pretty old shrimp. I was offered beef and brisket in a bowl.. that was also below room temperature. Black bean spare rib rice was not hot either.. SMH I really don't understand how they could serve food below room temperature to customers especially to Chinese people because they are usually known to be complainers!  I ordered shanghai fried noodles thank goodness the kitchen prepared it and it came to my table hot.. It was good.  I don't think I will be back.",

    "text": "I've been visiting Vegas many times and had passed by this place before (I even stayed at Palm Hotel last time which is just across street) but never thought about trying this place out. But this time when I was searching for a good Dim Sum restaurant this place just pop up. Coming from Bay area where we have so many good Dim Sum places, my expectations for dim sum are higher than just standard.  My husband and I went there on a Sunday and since they are open at 10am we planned to be there by 10am to avoid the crowd. And when we got there at 9:50am there was a long line already. But once they are opened we were seated accordingly so actually it was not too bad.   The food on the small carts came out hot (not the fried ones) and I was very impressed thay they even have my favourite dessert \"Mango Sago with Pomelo\" (it's a mango dessert drink that I had before in Hong Kong). All the dim sum items we ordered taste great,  their service staffs are very friendly and their dim sum prices are very reasonable. They don't make you feel that they are trying to rush you to leave like some other places.   Overall, I liked this place a lot and had enjoyed our meal. Will definitely return when in Vegas again!",

The restaurant is extremely big and can accommodate large parties pretty easily. Depending on the day and time, the line can get pretty long. My family and I usually come here on the weekdays to avoid the long lines.  Food is bomb. If only I knew the names, or even how to spell the names of the dishes we order. Most of the time we just point to what we want, if we don't know what they are technically called. Here are a few that I remember and that I would recommend: Siu Mai, Har Gow, Shrimp Ball w/ Sugar Cane, Chive Dumpling, BBQ Steamed Bun, Coconut Bun, and Egg Tarts!   The reason why I'm only giving this place 4 stars instead of 5 is because it's pretty pricy compared to other dim sum places.. and the service is sometimes bad.",

I had a number of dishes and they were all fairly priced for a restaurant in the hotel. For four individuals it costs us about each about $25 (also take in account that we order two chef specials and one a la Carter dish). Therefore, their food was not too pricey. As for the service, I will say it is typical for any dim sum restaurant. I will say some of their popular dishes (shuimai) were running out quickly. But I will say that if they don't have it on their cart, they will send someone to another cart to retrieve it for you, so you wouldn't have to wait.   Tea is also important for Dim Sum. Most restaurants that I've been to, I have had the tea as complimentary. This restaurant charged for tea per person and without giving me the choice of whether I wanted tea and tea choice. In addition, the tea was slightly bland.   As an Asian American, I had no issue with communication. And I think it's important to share this because Vegas is place where people come from all around the world. The cart servers and workers all spoke English and were able to articulate the dishes well enough for my non-Chinese speaking friends to understand.   Lastly, I will say that I would like to highlight that their shuimai, egg tarts, vegetarian chow mein, and BBQ pork buns were delicious!  I would come back!",

He reassured us that the place had the best dim sum in town and everyone who ate there were Asian and he's pretty much the only white guy.  Not being racist, but that's a good sign!    Food wise: The ladies come around in their carts and it's typical dim sum.  Some were good and some were re-steamed.  You can always tell because the shell at this point is a bit too mushy or it has a texture that you know it wasn't so fresh.  Nonetheless there was a good selection.  Atmosphere:  Yes, it can get packed and yes, there were a lot of Asians that dined here.  I almost felt like I was back in Hong Kong with people just talking super loud and being kinda rude.  Haha...  Bottom line: If dim sum is what you're looking for and you want something a little more authentic, this is an option.  I know the casinos on the strip has plenty of Asian restaurants, but it's more catered to the \"tourists\" crowd.  This feels a little more homey.",

There are many different options and all are mini servings so you can try so many different dishes...well obviously, its a dim sum! I will warn you that the Asian women servers can be mean! They don't speak any English and also have a horrible attitude. It makes me laugh though so don't get worked up, just laugh too. I have noticed they have warmed up to me because I have become a regular so now its not so bad. Overall its a fun experience, I highly recommend Ping Pang Pong.",

Wow that a very tasty beef soup loaded with various vegetables.   I ordered the Cantonese duck. Must say that was the best duck dish I ever had set my mouth into. For $12.95 it was a steal!  My wife had the lamb tenderloin. I've never had lamb tenderloin before this, and was very impressed with the taste & texture of the lamb. Was cooked perfectly. The vegetables mixed in with this dish could not have been a better choice.  For 2 people at dinner, we paid just over $50. Not terrible considering the quality we received.",

I would suggested get there early or you will have to wait in line and once they starts to get busy the waiters will forget about you. Such as refilled your water and clearing out  your empty dishes. Dim sum was good like any other dim sum place nothing to \"wow\"about. I guess it was Weekday so not too much choices on the dishes. The thing that brother us is, the restaurant is next to the casino floor and all the smoke were coming through the opening, sitting in the back will help a little.  We went back to get to go the next day, since it's across from out hotel. This time I was not impressed with the manager. After I had order we were sitting at an empty table near the door, the manager saw us and ask that we wait outside the door( which is the casino floor where the smoke is heavy.) and come back in 15-20 minutes to see if the Dim sum were ready. After 10 minutes I saw some people that were behind us whom also order to go were leaving with bags. So, I went back in and waited by the door. This time the manager told me to go to the lady at an counter, he said this is where you wait for your to go's. (This time his tone of voice was not friendly) I was upset by this, he should of told me that the first time instead of sending me out in the smoky room.   I would not suggests this place, bad customer service from the manager and 2nd hand smoking coming from the casino floor not good for the children.",

It was the WORST Chinese food I have ever eaten and the service was not too flash either.  They appeared out of nowhere with our plates of food and just shoved them down on the table without saying anything.  One server almost hit my husband in the side of the face with a plate of food.    A spring roll dropped on the table and the server just picked it up with her fingers, put it back on the plate and walked off.  We had waited almost half an hour for those spring rolls!!   I'm never trusting reviews again and I'm NEVER going back to this restaurant again.  Just awful!",

    "text": "One of my favorite restaurants in Las Vegas. Great authentic Chinese food tucked away in a casino off the strip (Gold Coast). If you find yourself staying at the Rio or Palms, it is a worthwhile walk. It's worth a drive from anywhere else.  I went there twice on my last trip to Vegas. The first time I got jellyfish and calamari with veggies in a hot sauce (a chef's special). I admit I was drawn to it for its \"weirdness,\" but also to prove to myself that it doesn't matter what you order. If you have an open mind, this place is a foodie adventure. Anyway, this dish was great. I started with the squab and pork lettuce cups, which were a little heavy on the lettuce, but they really didn't skimp on the meat either. Perfect amount of salt and tangy. Again, really good.  My second night there I had the Cantonese sausage fried rice and lamb tenderloin (more along the lines of what I would usually order) and it was very flavorful. Across the board, they do a great job with balancing flavors - hot and sweet, and a little hint of ginger when you are not expecting it.   Also, you gotta love $3.50 Tsing Tao beer...  Service is a little spotty, but I was dining alone and checking email/Facebook in the gaps, so I got by alright.  I highly recommend this place. Especially if your idea of Chinese food is that it should come out of a cardboard box. This is the kind of place that proves this cuisine can be as good as any other in a sit down restaurant setting.",

    "text": "Wandered around this place half a year ago. Took a look at the menu near the entrance and thought this is probably a very Americanized Chinese restaurant. Half a year later, I was driving around town and noticed a billboard saying they're voted the best Chinese restaurant in Vegas.   So I gave them a try. The first thing came to my mind - Gold Coast is better than I thought. After minutes of walking through the casino, I finally made it to the restaurant. It's an open space meaning people outside can see inside. The tables are placed in an traditional way and may seem to be too closed to each other if you expect more privacy.   I had no idea they had a long line waiting outside. I was there for at least half an hour. By the time I left there was no line. They did have a waitress come out and ask for party size but I don't think it helped at all.  It was lunch time, so beside regular menu, they have lots of dim-sum served as well. Actually people go there just for the dim-sum for lunch. I had 9 dishes plus one dessert. (yes I ate it all by myself) Not very good, but not bad either. Also had a mushroom tofu which I couldn't finish there, it was pretty yummy.   I expected the bill to be around 70, but surprisingly it was 47 after tax. Some of the dim-sum I ordered were only 2.88 and some are 3.88, not even close to the price I thought it would be. (Dim-sums are divided into two categories. Every time you get something, they stamp on your paper accordingly)   I laughed when I got the bill.The pronunciation of 8 in Chinese is similar to \"get rich\". The pricing is pretty authentic to Chinese culture.",

I looked on at gamblers with envy, at least they had the potential to get their money back. The glitzy massive billboards and numerous reviews that laud this place as one of the best Chinese food restaurants are misleading. Maybe that distinction was right in the past but I couldn't find anything that would qualify as \"best\".  I should've known with a name like Ping Pang Pong.   The problems began in the beginning. Once seated we were ignored for a good time and my sister had to get up and ask for drinks. The food that came was unmemorable and smelled odd, even for a Chinese restaurant. The Cantonese Princess Chicken was cold, bony, and slathered in oil. Our noodle dish was over seasoned with curry powder and had a pungent odor. It left my stomache feeling uneasy as I was driving home. The only food I liked was the sauteed Chinese brocolli and soup, unfortunately that's not enough to warrant a visit. Overall, I wouldn't recommend coming here especially when there are plenty of better options in the valley.",

To be honest with you, the dim sum here is good, but I wouldn't say its show stopping. Their Chinese broccoli with oyster sauce, or lack there of, was over cooked at the time we were serviced.   We did stumble upon one of the dim sum plates that I've never had before, it was a shrimp ball rolled in stick rice, and a broth like sauce much like egg drop soup was poured on top.... very delicious, flavorful, and filling.   As with the other reviewers, they do charge $0.50 for a pot of tea, not so bad.  Would I come here again for Dim Sum? ... Well if I had a hankering for dim sum and was in Vegas, probably yes; otherwise, I would wait to go back to California for Dim Sum.",

Ping Pang Pong has been voted one of the best Chinese Restaurant, according to Vegas Magazine and others alike. Nearly 3 years ago, Ping Pang Pong started their Dim Sum and I am wondering why have we only now just discovered this?  The venue is located inside the Gold Coast Casino, small to medium size and the kitchen is open where you can see the chefs prepare and cook the food.  The pros about being in a casino is that they have restrictions in cleanliness and maintain proper cleaning schedule.  Having an open expedition kitchen is a plus, because it's nice to see the chefs prepare the food depending on where you sit.  We had the best of the following, Pork and Shrimp Shumai, Shrimp Dumpling, 2 orders of Sweet  Pork Bun, Dim Sum Noodles, 2 orders  Pork Spare Ribs with black bean sauce, Crab Balls and Tofu with Shrimp paste.   First of all, every bite and taste of dim sum was so steamy or crunchy fresh that it just dissolved in our mouths! Then the service was fast and consistent with clearing our tables or refilling our beverages.   Ping Pang Pong is over $1 more than other places, but it is definitely worth the price mark up and hands down the best dim sum in Las Vegas!",

We went in a group of 5 people on a Saturday evening.  It was only lightly crowded and we were seated relatively quickly.    The plates have generous proportions, so a plate per person in the group is just enough to get you full.  We ordered: Wrinkled Green Beans, Chow Fun (or Beef Flat Noodle as they called it), Rosted Duck, Pineapple beef with Mushrooms and Lamb.  Everything we ordered was what you would expect from a \"legit\" Chinese restaurant.  I would go into detail about each of them, but quite honestly, it was a flurry of amazing flavor that I cannot do justice to describe, but I can definitely say, you HAVE to go try it.  The only reason they lost a star was the customer service.  It's not that the customer service was bad, but it wasn't very good.  It took two or three times to get water and rice, our last two plates were brought our after we were almost done with the first three, and they were not very attentive.

Got here because a friend of the family suggested this place.  I have not seen the variety that this dim sum place has, i.e. dim sum in Miami or NYC.  We had from siu mai, pork buns, yellow cake, chicken feet, custard buns, sticky rice in lotus leaf, and many more items some included sea urchin!!  they have a great variety of items, food is hot because the carts are always walking around and you can choose what you like to eat or try.  90% of the crowd is chinese, good sign!!!  Happy Dim Sum!",

It's really hard to find a good place to eat dim sum in Vegas.  But whenever I want dim sum, this is the go-to place, don't even risk trying the other ones, cuz you might want your money back :p  This review is only for the dim sum dishes, cuz I don't eat noodles or other entrees when I go for dim sum :) The dim sums are pretty good, but they only have a limited selection, I like it more when there is more varieties. The other thing is that this place is inside a casino, and the only thing that goes between you and the casino floor is a fence, so you always smell people smoking or people looking, kind of awkward... Also, I hate that this place only sells Portuguese egg tart on weekends, where the hell is my Hong Kong style egg tart?!?!?!",

    "text": "Rated as the best Chinese Restaurant in Vegas according to numerous billboards around Vegas. This means squat here on yelp. I just laugh when I hear stuff like this. I bet these come from the same people who says Olive Garden is the best Italian food in Vegas, Starbucks having the best coffee, or voting Taco Bell as having the best Mexican food. Just remember all the awards Sam Woo got, and we all know how good that place is. Anyways on with the review!  @ Shrimp Dumplings (Har gau) - Good shrimp taste. Disappointing texture on the skin. Changs has PPP beat on this one.  @ Pork Dumplings (Siu Mai) - This was okay. But much fresher than Changs.  @ Egg Custard Bun - This is just okay. But after having the gooey and hot filling back in SoCal, this just doesn't seem that good anymore. Filing was lukewarm, almost cold here.  @ Congee (jook) - Much better than Changs by far. Flavorful and hearty. If I didn't have to share with the other people around the table, this would be all mine!  @ Shrimp Rolled in Rice Noodles w/ Soy Sauce - Tastey shrimp taste, PPP has Changs beat on this one by a narrow margin with a better rice noodle wrap and soy sauce.  @ Oysters - Good oysters, but they need to clean it more thoroughly. Almost every bite, I got grit in my mouth. Couldn't really enjoy the oysters because of this  @ Almond Covered Shrimp Balls - Yummy shrimps, but found the almonds unnecessary since you couldn't really taste it. But if you like almonds, you'll enjoy this item. Toasting the almonds a little bit would really bring out the flavor of the dish.  @ Fried Shrimp + Crab Claw - Its shrimp stuffed into a crab leg and deep fried. Yum and definitely a good item to get.   @ Fried Tofu - Crispy, but found it a little too salty for me. HK Star got this dish down.  @ Red Bean Sesame Balls - Red bean was good, but the sesame balls is disappointing. Its the soggy and oily appetizer that reminds me what sesame balls are. Properly prepare this, and I'll enjoy this dish.  @ Tea - Usually I don't comment on the tea, but tea is traditionally part of dim sum. This tea was weak. Of course, it naturally got more weaker as the teapots got refilled. So towards the end of the meal, you're literally just drinking water. Even Pho Village gives me better tea with my meal than this place. Really really REALLY disappointing.   \"Ping Pang Pong\", the place with the name that sounds racist and probably won't eat there because of it (Lily D). I'm not sure whats up with Chinese restaurants in Vegas and crappy names (see Food Express Chinese Restaurants), but it just makes my head explodes. I swear they do the opposite of picking the best names, and pick the most stereotypical Chinese restaurant name they can think of. /endrant  This is more pricier than Changs, but this place is a little more consistent than Changs. Some stuff Changs is better and some stuff, PPP is better. This is probably as good as it gets for dim sum in Vegas. This will be satisfactory for most. But for those raised in CA dim sum, you will be disappointed.",

    "text": "no, no, no, no, no....  Despite the abundance of restaurants in Las Vegas, my family and I somehow ended up here for dinner because of its proximity to the bowling tournament that my mother was going to be participating in. I yelped it, saw 3 1/2 stars and thought to myself, \"ok shouldn't be too bad\". Well, it was REALLY BAD. Horrendous service - our waiters seemed to have completely vanished upon taking our orders. Food didn't come until about 30-45 minutes later, and when they did, it was cold. What the f***?!  Entrees we ordered:  Seafood porridge - I asked them to add the preserved egg, which I had been craving. Well, the porridge was bland and I had to keep adding soy sauce to make it better. The preserved egg tasted funky, not at all like what I was used to in LA's Chinatown. Gobo beef - EW. They were basically big cubes of beef (bigger than bite size, so it was a little hard chewing on them)  that seemed to have been boiled in soy sauce. They also seemed a little bloody. Salt and pepper pork chops - They were pretty standard. A little bit dry. Hot braised chicken - This was the only semi-decent dish. But it was basically sweet and sour chicken.  Shrimp fried rice - This one arrived to the table first, a good 20 minutes before the actual entrees arrived. So it was cold by the time we started eating. Not good.  I didn't try their dimsum; if that's what I wanted, I could've just gone to Chinatown. But this is definitely not a good dinner spot.",

    "text": "This place is a disaster!  We went on a Sunday Night for dinner. They have a big dim sum service on Sunday morning/afternoon which basically leaves them with no food on Sunday night. We tried to order appetizers, but they literally did not have any left. NONE! No spring rolls, no potstickers, nothing! Seriously people, if you are out of food close the restaurant, don't stay open and disappoint your customers because they can't order what they want.  As for the foods that they did have, my sister ordered the duck, I ordered the orange chicken, my brother-in-law ordered a brisket thing and our friend ordered the chicken chow mein. The cooks all make different foods and don't sync up the food to come out at the same time. So when an entree is done they bring it out to your table, even if the other entrees aren't ready yet. The duck came first, it was a few minutes before the orange chicken came out, and then another 5 minutes at least before the chow mein came out. This would be fine it you are eating family style and everyone is sharing everything, but if you are ordering and eating your own entree like we were it creates a big problem. You can either be rude and eat your food while it's hot, or be polite and wait for everyone to get their food while yours gets cold.  You will notice that I said my brother-in-law ordered a brisket something but I didn't mention when it got delivered. That's because we never got it! Another problem with the way they bring the food out is if they forget something, you just kind of assume it's still coming, and you don't think to ask about it. Our waitress never ordered the brisket, and we didn't discover this until it was too late.  As for the food itself, my sister was happy with the duck, but I didn't try it as duck is not my thing. The orange chicken was okay, but I've had much better.  Obviously being as our server forgot to order one of our entrees I'm not going to give the service a very high mark. Additionally, the atmosphere of the restaurant was really bad. It's located in the casino, very close to all the slot machines and casino action and as a result is very loud. It's a small space and they try to cram as many people in as possible so its very cramped and uncomfortable.  So to review, the food is bland but okay, the service and atmosphere sucks and if you go on Sunday night (and I would assume Saturday too) expect them to be out of everything.",

Idon't get how anyone can say that this dim sum is amazing, unless they've only had Vegas dim sum.  I'm sorry if I sound elitest... but take my word.  If you read my review you will know not to come here.  Chicken feet had an off taste as well as being kinda cold.  I guess most Vegas dim sumers are not fans of chicken feet.  The shui mai was just bad.  The tripe was overly braised and the texture (one of my favorite parts of tripe) was just bad.  It felt like I was eating fat, not tripe.  Nothing good here.  The only reason i gave it two stars was because it really is one  of the few dim sum places in Vegas.  The other one that got the better Yelp reviews was temporarily closed I guess the kitchen burned down or something.",

The dofu fah, har gow, sui mei, Chinese sausage and egg white fried rice, beef cheurng fun were all very good.   If you are here for the Koi Palace atmosphere, with the Koi palace experience then this probably not for you.

Also, the carts may not be able to hold everything so a server comes around separately to offer a dish and they often pass over a table.  The deal breaker?  They charge for tea.  Are you serious?!!

    "text": "Come for the Dim Sum.  Arrived 11am and it was fairly busy.  Full of Asian families taking their time and enjoying themselves.  Ambience - Clean, well lit and noisy like most Dim Sum places.  Open kitchen which is somewhat unusual and a good thing.  Price - Ordered 1 A item and 4 B items plus 2 Tsin Dao beers ($7) for a total lunch of $22.38.  Service - Funny start when they tried to make me take a menu (I'm only part asian so I guess they wanted to make me order ala carte food).  After that it was good.  The hostess seated me right away and the food carts rotate quickly and consistently.  I hardly finished each plate and it was whisked away.  Busboy offered me a second beverage before I had to ask anyone for another.  Food - Excellent selection sorted by food types: baked and fried goods, steamed goods, large sides (like fried rice), dessert and fresh beverage.  Pork Shui Mai - Good flavor but slightly chewy (like a typical chicken texture).  BBQ Pork Bun Baked (Char Sui Bao) - Perfect bun texture and flavor with a tasty glaze coating (your hands will get sticky).  Stuffing of bbq pork was tasty.  Pork Dumpling (gau style not pot sticker) - Must have! great crispy dough contrasts with lightly chewy stuffing.  Lightly sweet flavor is delicate and delicious.  Char Sui Bao steamed - Great flavor but dough wasn't my favorite (stick to the baked ones).  Shrimp dumpling (Har Gau) - Good sized value with sticky wrapper and delicately spiced shrimp filling.  Each one must have at least two 10-12 shrimps in it.  Didn't try the fried rice, dessert cart or the fresh juice cart (soup or beverage?).  They also paraded around an asparagus plate that looked and smelled wonderful but I was too full.  I was pleasantly surprised by the quality and value of this place and would recommend it.  I'm picky about Dim Sum and this place does a decent job on everything I tried and better than average with the Baked BBQ Pork Bun and Ha Gau.",

    "text": "One of my highlights during my recent trip to Vegas was visiting Gold Coast where I tried the slot machines and came out ahead with some change.  And then visiting Ping Pang Pong for lunch and dinner.  PPP offers authentic Chinese dim sum with some unique items which I don't see in SCal, or maybe I have yet to visit to the ones that serve the similar dim sum fare.  Chill waitresses, friendly service, they are more than happy to show you what's in those little tins from their carts.   The porridge with century old eggs was very satisfying, I was half full after eating it.  Enough century old egg pieces in it to qualify for the name if you know what I mean.  Here is my YAY!()   The slow cooked/simmered snails ($5.88) on dim sum menu is probably quite common in Hong Kong, but it's rare in the States.  Definitely a winner.  They were easy to be taken out from the shell, nothing broke off in the process, marvelous!  I enjoy doing that!  They were very flavorful, slightly spicy but not too spicy and had a nice chewiness to them.  What a treat!  Good times. ()  The shrimp ball with sticky rice is a variation from the well known ,but theirs have more vegetable matter and less shrimp matter than I expected.  Still good though, and goes well with the egg white dipping sauce.    After I spotted the snails, fried shrimp balls with sugar cane ($5.88) were put on the back burner, I ended up taking them to go.  Those shrimp balls got nothing on them snails.  They didn't taste that good when they were cold, they probably taste better when they were freshly made.    The disc shaped sticky rice patty with lotus seed paste is the kind of mochi that I like to have for snack.  Not too sweet but sticky enough.  I should have got some to go.  Can't resist the sight of any pan fried dumplings, how can I?  Just look at their pan fried bottoms.  In this case, the bun was perfect but the filling needed to be bigger and more substantial with more meat.  This restaurant is shaped right, the circular floor plan goes well with la rotunda breadbasket of mine. I like the decor too, very Chinese in a traditional way.  ()  Encouraged by the dim sum success, I thought I would try their dinner.  I wasn't particularly inspired by the porridge with abalone ($9.99) which didn't have much flavor as I expected.  I had better ones at a friend's house with chucks of abalone pieces.  But this is how they make it in most Cantonese restaurants, you get the thinly sliced abalone pieces in the porridge.  Dried abalone is some kind of delicacy, but quality various.  Those were definitely not the best I've had.  And they don't put much in there.  If you read the knock-off version of Sun Tzu Art of War, and take the last strategy's number, minus 2 dozens, that's the number of abalone slices I got in the porridge.  When I was having dinner, I noticed they (the managers or the ppl by the register) just let the customers waiting by the door without acknowledging them and telling them how long the wait would be, that's rude.",

So I have called in and asking to book a seat said we will be there around 8. the lady who answer the phone said they have plenty of seats and no need to reserve. Then the next thing you know, we spend 30 minutes waiting at the line because we got told don't have any table for us.   * Food was an ok. no much different compare to the restaurant I had at New York.   * Waitress who was working on our table was giving us  dirty look. for ordering too much food and beer?  * Manager was super nice and super helpful. we ran out beer, trying to asking for more, she helped us ordering beers from their supplier with minutes. I will be back here to give it another try.",

We waited over 20 minutes to be seated and then when it was our turn they wanted us to sit at a table that literally nobody should sit at because they basically put a table in the lobby. I had people from the line standing over me while I are my food, crowds of people surrounding my table as they are walking in and out, carts bumping my table, and little kids touching my table as they walk by. It was worse than sitting by the bathroom. The host was really rude and said we couldn't sit at another table because there was only two of us. That was bullshit and I won't be eating there again. Oh and to top it off there were people cutting a the line because they allow reservations for \"special\" guests. This place needs new management.",

Some of the dishes, like the siu mai weren't fresh, maybe from the previous night... Some of the dishes that came out didn't seem authentic, one was wrapped in a tortilla...? Another was also odd, \"gold sand bun\" or something, it was a little sweet bun with sugar in the middle... Never had that before and I don't recommend it. A couple things they did get right, but I can't remember which dishes because they were just right, not exceptional.

The salt & pepper pork chops were nothing but fat & bone. The fried rice was a basic white rice with boiled chicken. No seasonings & when I asked for a knife to cut off the fat our waitress ignored me for 5 min while waiting on tables who had already been served \"many\" food items way before us. No refill on soda until we were ready to leave. Then as we are leaving she decided to stand by our table asking if everything was ok? Having eaten in many 5 star resturants on the west coast & midwest this is one step below panda express at best! Terrible service & obviously only wants to cater to Asians! Never again!! Yuck!",

    "text": "TL:DR. TO THOSE THAT ARE SENSITIVE TO MSG, BEWARE. Good dim sum, very affordable prices for a casino setting. BTW, they do not accept Discover as a form of credit card.  Coming from a city that is very big on dim sum, Ping Pang Pong gets the job done for Vegas dim sum. Now i will admit that it is not Los Angeles or San Francisco quality, this place still offers a lot of varieties that are seen in dim sum places. They have the old fashioned feel of steam carts being pushed around while you pick your selections, and the steam foods are very fresh during dim sum service.   They also offer a very nice late night menu as a lot of their dishes resemble good Cantonese flavor. Selected dim sum is offered at night time. The rice plates are tasty while they serve up some of the Chinese favorites such as Salt and Pepper Pork Chops, steamed razor clams/scallops, Mapo Tofu, and Asian vegetables. Fried rice and noodle plates are also solid. Also, they have a special where they serve a 5 pound lobster for about $80, not a bad deal in this town.  The service here is what you would expect from a Chinese restaurant, quick and convenient, and the servers definitely know how to do their jobs well. The servers are very English friendly if needed be.   As for the bad, the wait here can be very long during lunch hours, as well as opening of dinner service. Also, if you are sensitive to MSG, do not eat here as they are definitely not shy of it. You will know with crazy amount of thirst after you eat.",

With 10 of us we were seated right after it opened.  We were at the table where all the employees had to open the cabinet to put their personal items so we had to keep moving out of the way. The food carts seemed to have been sparse in our area but we were able to order what we wanted from the server. My favorites were the shrimp churn fun and the gai mei bao. The shrimp was huge! All of the food was good but I wish we got to have more of a variety like the turnip cake that I love or tripe.    Ping Pang Pong is definitely a little on the pricey side for dim sum but it is worth it. Even though you do have to walk into a smokey casino you will forget that once you are seated surrounded by loud parties.",

We had to call a host and make sure there was comp in the cards; walking up to the cashiers they already had our comp listed down and filed!  Getting our check we saw that they billed us for a dish twice when we only ordered it once.

We had arrived when they first opened @ 5pm and I ordered beef chow fun. They come back and told me it was sold out already, disappointed and couldn't believe they were out in less the. 10 minutes after opening.    We had ordered Singapore Noodles, which I've never had before so I don't know if it was good or not, but I personally didn't care for the flavor. But while eating my noodles, one was chewy, I finally went to pull it out of my mouth, it was the EXACT same color as the noodles, and when I looked at what it was, it was a rubber band!!! OMG, grossed me out, got the manager, and she replaced the noodles with a new batch, but so scary knowing that one of the children could of eaten it.   The moo shu pork was good. But after the rubber band incident, I will never go back.",

The Scallop Hot Pot had very tender scallop meat and a generous amount of garlic, but was surprisingly bland, especially for the number of garlic cloves. It was almost as if it was watered down.   The server talked us out of the Tea Smoked Duck and into the the Crisp Roasted Chicken with Scallions, which turned out to be simply a fairly standard dish, nothing to get excited about. It tasted predominantly of soy sauce and was fairly tender.   The Cantonese Sausage Fried Rice was the better of the three dishes. It had a nice lingering flavor, and came in a very generous portion. Still not terribly exciting.  On a more minor note, the Thai iced tea was wanting. It simply did not have the full flavor I have found at most other restaurants.",

The only reason I gave it a one star is because I like the food but the service is terrible.",

    "text": "Situated in the heart of the Gold Coast, Ping Pang Pong is a great, basic dim sum restaurant that is frequented by the large asian population that is situated around the Spring Mountain area of Las Vegas -- which obviously means they are doing something right!   If you are expecting a noisy, traditional dim sum restaurant full of almost fights over dishes you are going to be disappointed. However, this lack of hostility does not take away from the food being fantastic. All of the servers are very friendly and eager to explain all of the dishes on their carts. Also the servers do speak English very well and also speak at least one dialect of Chinese.   I would recommend this restaurant to anyone who is curious to learn more about Chinese culture, cuisine, and the world of dim sum.",

It was tender and quite flavorful.  - Beef chow fun was pretty good and the portion was generous. Kind of unremarkable. Not too oily. No real unique taste. - Free hot tea :) - Fast service. Quick with refills. - If you see a lot of old asian grand ma's and pop's, then you know its legit! lol - It's pleasant enough for me to come back and try their dim sum.  - For dinner, I'd opt for wendy's noodle cafe.  :)!",

Located in the Gold Coast, the restaurant is open-aired... with no windows and a view of the casino. We waited for about 10 minutes to be seated and then the fun began! Loaded carts of Dim Sum treats continually circle the restaurant awaiting your waive to procure more. The dumplings were outstanding with a selection of several meats and styles from rice flour to a flaky pastry crust. The cucumber salad was very good and spiced well. Our favorite was the delicate noodle dumpling filled with spiced pork. Best to brush up on your dim sum knowledge as many of the servers do not speak alot of English... just enough to let you know the main ingredient! And... each selection is about $2.50 to $5, leaving us with a very reasonable check!",

    "text": "Having given up on Dim Sum upon my move to Las Vegas six years ago, I had done all my mourning of not being able to drive to Monterey Park from West LA for a Sunday post-clubbing ritual.  I was not expecting much when I arrived at Ping Pang Pong this past weekend, but began to fan little fires of hopes when I saw a restaurant filled with Chinese people and outfitted with a long line also filled with Chinese people.  When they served us a steaming pot of Chinese red tea (forget the stereotypical Jasmine green), my hopes went from little flames to a pretty sizable campfire.  When the cart arrived and I had to explain to the Chinese cart-tender lady what I was looking for since she only spoke marginal English, I felt like I traveled through space and was suddenly in Arcadia.    My favorites, Siu Mai and Har Gow, more than passed the test.  Siu Mai was surprisingly topped with fish eggs, which added a much-welcomed dynamic in texture.  Har Gow was delicious due to fresh shrimp fillings and a properly-made dough that didn't dry up after five minutes on the cart like the other Vegas Dim Sum joints.  My new adventure, Rice Paper-Wrapped Youtiao (Chinese fried bread stick) filled with Pork, was a perfect combination of tastes, textures, and ingredients.   Our late arrival cost me my Dim Sum must-have: egg tarts; which provides me with a good reason to come back and visit this Sunday.  In the future, I will no longer avoid restaurants that are in funky casinos like the Gold Coast.  I could be missing out on a lot of yummy egg tarts.",

The vibe is as follows: downtown, somewhere in the middle of a Chinatown - not in Vegas but more of some big port city (like NYC or SF) - duck-in-amidst bustling streets filled with shrimp merchants and trinket salespeople. Yeah- but it IS in Vegas! It's amazing how one can be transported someplace completely different just by a meal. That, of course, occurs when the meal is done right.   We enjoyed the dim sum, and thank goodness we started going back to the gym. I say this because we had a bit more of a guilt-free attitude as we looked over a packed table filled with our favorite dim sum dishes-all cooked to perfection with rustic Chinese authenticity in mind.   We started with tofu and shrimp balls, covered in hot peppers. Now, I hate tofu. My wife is very good at encouraging me to try new things, so with a little hesitation, I took a bite. Awesome! I had more, and my wife and I faced off for the last one. She won, however I had some shrimp balls hanging around waiting to be devoured, so all was not lost. We had the skinny noodle chow mein (huge portion....finished it). Amazing! For one thing, it was brought to our table steaming hot. The flavors consisted of aromatic young onion, assorted Chinese vegetables, covered in tasty fried bean sprouts.   I could write paragraph on top of paragraph in order to describe the amazing tastes of each item we had, but don't have all day.   I HAVE to mention those sesame balls! DAYUMMM! Not only were they the best ever, but my wife and I went into some sort of weird blissful state as we polished off both plates and washed them down with the yummy Chinese tea. We had to sit there and take it all in before composing ourselves and finally getting the courage to face rows of slots as we made our way back to the car.   I also must mention the service. The staff was outstanding and kept our water and tea filled. They took the time to explain each dish in detail.   Oh, and the prices! Cheap! We were probably about $20 in when we were full, but continued into the $45 range for both of us because the food was that good.   Ping Pang Pong is the best Chinese I ever had - period, and I really hope people will take notice and place it into 5-star land where it belongs.   Thanks Ping Pang Pong!!!!",

    "text": "It's hard to believe, but the best dim sum in Las Vegas is NOT found in our burgeoning (and otherwise excellent) Chinatown district stretching along Spring Mountain Road. Instead, truly \"world-class\" dim sum is to be found in the Ping Pang Pong Restaurant in the Gold Coast Hotel & Casino.  Honest.  From your basic steamed buns & fried rice to more esoteric fare like chicken feet & jellyfish, Ping Pang Pong serves it all.  Situated in the back of the western half of the Gold Coast, it nevertheless has built a reputation for authentic, tasty dim sum, so the lunch crowd is uniformly large. I recommend coming here when you have at least an hour to spend on your midday meal. Dim Sum may be Chinese fast food, but the price of Ping Pang Pong's excellence is crowds.  A note on the authenticity of Ping Pang Pong's cuisine: On several visits, I have been the most caucasian customer seated, and I'm half-filipino. Which brings me to another point: none of the waitstaff here seems to have a firm handle on English, so, although the service has always been excellent, ordering always seems to involve lots of gestures and nodding.  I have a kind of method to my own dim sum madness: I sit down, order some tea (or a beer), and wait for the carts to roll by. And, even if the dessert cart comes first, I start pointing to things that look good. One of my favorite desserts-as-appetizers are sesame balls filled with red bean paste. Another favorite appetizer: a steamed bun filled with a single, spicy Cantonese sausage. But I'm not finicky about what comes first. The point of a dim sum lunch is to enjoy as many different tastes as you can before you're completely topped off. Before long, I typically have as many as a dozen different dishes crowded onto my table.  As the helpful cart-pushers place each dish on your table, they mark your check with a stamp or a pen, indicating how many dishes you ordered & what \"class\" those dishes belong to. As far as I've been able to determine, the least expensive dishes run about 2 dollars while the most expensive run about 5 dollars. Because I am such a pig (ordering not only my favorites, but also anything I've never seen before), my bill is usually about 30 bucks, but you can have a nice, filling lunch for half of that.  The aforementioned jellyfish is light & vinegary, a little crunchy & slightly fishy, perfectly complemented with a splash of chili sauce, and I use it as a palette cleanser between courses. They also do a wonderful little bowl of sausage & egg fried rice. (One of the few dishes -- like the perfectly-fried chicken wings -- that my diehard midwestern Princess feels brave enough to eat.) Unlike most westerners, I am comfortable with the texture of gelatinous food, and Ping Pang Pong offers an incredible serving of spicy beef tendon, slow-cooked with onions and sprinkled with chili flakes.  Other highlights include:  * The rice-noodle rolls, where the gooey white noodles are wrapped around a filling like beef or a crunchy pastry and the whole thing gets bathed in a brothy sauce. The overall texture of the dish is a flavorful jelly filled with bits of chewiness -- again, not a combination one finds in the average American eatery.  * The steamed-chicken & glutinous rice wrapped in a leaf, where the wrap (a lotus leaf? a banana leaf?) effectively stews the mixture of chicken & rice into soupy goodness that's best addressed with a spoon.  * Char-siu ribs, the red spare-ribs that are sweet & chewy awesomeness. I go at these with my bare hands and generally leave the restaurant with a fair amount of the meat still stuck between my teeth.  * Steamed meatballs, either ground beef or pork, mixed with some bits of veggie and wrapped with a thin skin of egg, these are stick-to-your-ribs meaty & delicately spongy, and they absolutely scream for generous dollops of chili sauce.  I could go on, but you get the point. In a city that built the lowbrow end of its culinary reputation on the all-you-can-eat buffet, the dim sum lunch at Ping Pang Pong Restaurant offers a sublime alternative: a cornucopia of flavors at a very reasonable price. And the buffet rolls past your table, instead of you having to get up and walk to it. Talk about convenience.  Anytime you feel like braving the wilds of the Gold Coast to get to dim sum heaven, I'd be happy to meet you there.",

My husband ordered some spicy noodle soup that was also flavorless and not event a hint of spice. I'm really surprised the place was busy and the other reviews were good, I would never recommend this place. I left the place grumpy, hunger and out of pocket $25.",

We finally got around to it this weekend and I can't believe what I've been missing!  Turns out it's like a backwards buffet, except the food is way fresh and instead of going to get it yourself, there are these lovely ladies that bring around an assortment of tasty Chinese treats on carts. The food is hot, fresh and oh soooo savory!  My favorite was the devilishly, delicious fried crab claw and the seaweed salad was scrumptious on the side.  Make sure to ask for some of the chili sauce for dipping those claws though, and it goes well with pretty much everything else too ;) I'm Very much looking forward to a return visit to try some new and exciting culinary delights.",

I've had dim sum in San Francisco and Toronto; this visit, this day, PPP was almost on par. Almost everything was delicious. We had several different dumplings, some buns and several selections from the menu as well. One standout (again, I apologize for not knowing names) was a shrimp dumpling that had a creamy, slightly sweet filling that almost \"burst\" in the mouth, and was served with candied walnuts. Oh. My. That was so good. Other dishes featuring pork, beef and chicken were fantastic.  Total bill including tax and tip for 8 people and a ton of dim sum and 5-6 menu dishes: $200. An absolute steal. If I could go 4.5 stars, I'd do so. Ping Pang Pong is a winner.",

    "text": "I usually hit up Ping Pang Pong a couple of times a month. It is always packed with degenerate Asian gamblers and their families. It is located inside the Gold Coast which is notorious for having this type of clientele.   I am always the only caucasian person here but I don't care. I love ethnic food especially dim sum which I was not able to get back east unless I traveled to Boston's Chinatown. I did not do this at all.   I always opt to sit at their dining island which over looks the action in the kitchen. It's like watching a show. Very entertaining. Always 3 cooks manning the hot woks and 2 guys pumping out different types of dim sum. I flag down the cart pushers and they stop. I have never tried any of the crazy stuff like chicken feet or squid. I know what I like and i go for it hard.   I usually end up getting lo mai gai, sticky rice wrapped in lotus leaf. This is simple and good. Little bits of chinese sausage in the rice. I order the pan fried pot stickers which are juicy and hot. Shu mai are made with pork and shrimp. Har gow are shrimp dumplings. Shrimp and scallion cakes are pan fried. Bbq pork buns are fluffy.  Everything is served small plate style perfect for sharing. And everything is very inexpensive. I think like $2.35 per dish. I have not tried anything off their full menu but i'm sure it delicious. Dim Sum is daily till 3:00pm I believe. But the rest of the menu is served after that and the restaurant is open till 3:00am.  I think the dim sum is better quality and fresher here than at Orchid Gardens.",

Who new there was dim sum in this older hotel in Vegas.  We came here around 12 on Sunday memorial weekend and we waited about 10 minutes before being seated.  There were a lot of chinese patrons eating there so that was a good sign.    Stick Rice in Louts leaves- It was very good and tasted fresh but it only came one in each steamer so we had to order 3.   Shrimp dumplings- standard good nothing bad to say. Rolled noodles with beef- I actually like this a lot despite how light the sauce is compared to other dim sum places. bbq buns- they are very good and fresh tasting stuffed eggplant- decent lil dry   I would go back to this place when I am craving for dim sum and chinese.   Only three stars cuz it is a drive from the strip and it really smelled like smoke walking thru the casino.",

    "text": "Arrived just after it opened at 10am and found a long line.  Every single person eating there was Asian. The prices were very reasonable for most dishes but it depends on what you order of course, which depends on what carts are circulating.  They had quite a large selection of dim sum when I was standing outside waiting in line but very few carts by the time I got in 40 minutes later.  They kept bringing the cart of overpriced specialty dishes and another one with deserts to our table but not the cart of deep fried dishes or buns.  They did bring a cart of steamed dumplings, but then it was 20 - 30 minutes before we saw it again.  Most tables were waiting for carts.  I guess they were loading them up again since we finally saw the missing carts coming out of the kitchen as we were leaving.  Also, several carts are presented when you first sit down, but after that the servers will simply pass your table by.  You have to be aggressive and chase them down unless it's the pricey cart of Chow Mien ($6.50), Gai Lan (Chinese Broccoli $9), or fancy prawn dishes..    Of the food itself, some dishes were really good, most were excessively greasy, and a few were stale.  The bun with egg yolk inside tasted like it was made the day before or unfrozen.  The steamed rice roll/crepe with shrimp inside was very good but the Kalbi ribs were disgusting and inedible.  The chicken feet were very good, but the desert of mochi with black sesame paste filling (Gee Mah?) was cold.  I've never had it served completely cold before.  The egg rolls were fine.  The chewy deep fried mocha/rice balls with ground pork inside were really good and the Shu Mai and Haw Gow were fine.  They need to work on their consistency of food availability and food quality but for the price I allow more than I would at the higher prices of the Las Vegas strip hotels and the crowds speak for themselves.  The wait staff was pleasant to us, but the servers would not lift the containers to show you what was inside and gave very limited explanations.  One guy next to us had to get out of his seat to see what was on the cart and soon began lifting lids too, which is very unsanitary in my opinion.   He shouldn't have had to do that to find out what is offered on a cart.  He also had to get extra napkins for his table and for us.  On the plus side, the hostess didn't argue with us when we refused tea and asked for water instead and we were not charged for tea later on the bill either.",

Once seated, we only saw two types of carts circulating:one with hot dishes and one baked goods. That was it. When asked about other usual dim sum dishes, none of them was available. We were told the kitchen has closed. What a disappointment. For the dishes that were available, they were just ok, nothing special beyond any regular dim sum places in the Bay Area.

I also think that most of this food is prepared in advance so it is most likely freshest when the doors open. Other than China Mama, this has been the second best hot&sour soup that we have had in the area, but it does depend on which cook is making it, we have been disappointed from time to time. Also, watch out for the snails! I don't think the use good techniques for cleaning them prior to cooking, and they have been gritty and foul tasting. Don't be shocked by the inattentive and rude service, that's how they treat everyone and the price you pay if you want to enjoy authentic Chinese cooking!",

The casino itself is a little ragged, but the samplings were varied and the next cart was never too far away! Now, if we could have just chopsticked the kid's lurking from the casino side all would have been well with the world and our dim sum!",

    "text": "Located in the Gold Coast Casino next to the Rio Hotel, Ping Pang Pong is a Chinese resto with great prices. Note: Gold Coast Casino is owned by Boyd Gaming-the same owners of the California Hotel, Fremont, and Main Street Station in Downtown. When you step in Gold Coast, you will notice that its pretty much a bigger and nicer version of California Hotel. Ping Pang Pong is located past Noodle Exchange on the right side. I came here on 2 occasions and tasted the following:  Minced Squab Lettuce Cups, Walnut Prawns, Cantonese Sausage Fried Rice, Asparagus and Bamboo Mushroom, Chicken Feet, Singapore Rice Noodles, Roast Duck  Nothing disappointed. Everything was delicious and freshly made. I like how the kitchen is open and you can see the cooks tossing the woks and stir frying the food. Also, the prices are great with every dish no less than 14 dollars. I would say this place has the best Chinese food in Vegas because it combines great taste with great value. Though its a 20 minute drive from our place, my wife and I would come here again when we are in the mood for some good Chinese grub.",

    "text": "The name almost sounds like the punchline for a bad joke you wouldn't dare tell at a Chinese restaurant. Except Ping Pang Pong is not that, nor is it the name of the Azn triplets in your cringeworthy joke.  At Ping Pang Pong, they take their dim sum quite seriously. At least I'm pretty sure their dim sum is among the best I've ever had. I love how they add these bits of salted shrimp to their taro cake for flavor. Yum.  It seems a bunch of the older casinos in Vegas have a 'hidden gem'; Ping Pang Pong is Gold Coast casino's. We went there for lunch & there was this mega queue of Azn ppl (as myself), a queue that stayed long, long after we were done eating lunch (we stayed to play a bit of Wheel of Fortune). I figured this meant that a continuous stream of people kept coming in - & that that's maybe because the food is good. The things I learn from watching Sherlock.  TIP: How do you skip the super long line at Ping Pang Pong? No, this isn't that non-PC joke  If you spot a big empty table that will seat you/your group & the people in front of/behind you, consider befriending them, at least temporarily, for the purpose of sharing the table. That's what we did. There were 3 of us, 2 of them, & a few empty seats separating us from them. Otherwise, we would've had to wait another 30 minutes to an hour.",

    "text": "Only one experience here but it was so poor that I decided to write this review. Had a room at the resort (Gold Coast) where this restaurant is located. Arrived on a late-evening flight and decided to order takeout. I'm an eggitarian and after looking at the menu, picked the mapo tofu from the \"Veggies and Tofu\" section.  Now I realize that vegetarian and vegan are difficult for oriental cuisines, so on placing my order, I checked with the cashier. Even though the item was listed in the \"Veggies and Tofu\" section. Because belt and suspenders. I asked if the item was vegetarian and she said yes. She seemed to speak decent English so I figured I was safe. Got back to the room and started eating. Less than a minute into it, I bite into something with a chewy, meaty texture. I look closer and it appears to be ground pork or beef. By this time it's close to midnight and I don't have the energy to go back downstairs, complain, and wait for another order. Cashiers and servers should really know the menu items at their restaurants. If they don't, how can they effectively serve their customers?  So I email the casino about my experience and ask them to contact me. That was 3 days ago. Still no email. It is almost industry standard these days to place a \"V\" next to vegetarian items and a \"VG\" next to vegan items. And heart icons for heart-healthy etc. Probably takes 2 minutes to modify the menu with these identifiers.  I am fairly liberal with tipping, so on takeout orders, I pay and tip when I place the order. I want my 3 bucks back.  Wait. I'm retarded. I want all of my money back...",

    "text": "What a hidden gem. Ever since I saw dumpling restaurants on the Travel channel, I've wanted to try one. I don't know the correct terminology, so I apologize that I can't describe the experience more eloquently.   Only available during lunch hours, little carts containing a vast variety of dumplings and other authentic foods circle around, going to each table. They open each lid and quickly describe what the container holds, you simply nod or say \"no thank you\". Whatever you chose is quickly put on your table, and the carts move on. It's very efficient and artistic in a way.   Ok, the food itself: everything we had was good. My favorite was the steamed BBQ pork bun. I wish I had known a bit more, or would have been braver. It would have been great to have someone more familiar with the foods to help us , but I never felt unwelcome. Each server spoke English, and was nice.   My only suggestion is that maybe they could have a menu for us newbies, so we could better understand what delicious little treats are hidden in each of those little pots.   Pricing is very reasonable, hard to tell what each pot costs. They mark on a card each time you make a selection. I think we had 6 selections (each pot has about 3 dumplings). It was enough for 2 to share, and our bill was about $24.",

The wait can be extremely discouraging if you are a regular guest and dont know anyone that works here to pull you ahead of line. Expect to wait at least 30 minutes not because of the food but because of the line / seating situation. I have witnessed waiting in line for 30 mins on few occasions and noticed some workers will help their friends get seated faster without waiting which caused most of the public people in line frustrated. Also if you are a casino guest at a certain tier you also get to go in front of line. After groups of friends and casino guests were pulled into the front of line i noticed 3 separate groups of people in line in front of me left because they were upset with the way the line worked which helped me get seated faster. I no longer go inlesa im with group that knows a worker to sneak us in or use my players card for the casino tier. The portions are not as large as other cities and the prices are a bit higher than normal vegas prices but you are paying casino prices so it is on par with the food. Service can be hit and miss but thats a norm in this establishments. Definitely save room for the Pastries!",

I don't need my butt kissed by the staff.   What I do care about is good food and Ping Pang Pong comes through in that department.   You'll find many of the American Chinese classics you know and love like sweet and sour pork, as well as traditional favorites like fish stew. Everything is masterfully prepared to order in an open kitchen.   It's also inexpensive. Most entrees will only run you a couple bucks more than what you'd pay at Panda Express.   In a city filled with good Chinese food, Ping Pang Pong is my favorite.",

We ordered several items and found the portions to be hearty and flavorful. I would recommend to anyone on food alone. This is not a place you order orange chicken and other Panda Express fare.  Now the bad, total disorganized mess trying to get seated. While waiting in the designated spot multiple people were seated before us just because they were a) clueless and just walked up to the pay register b) jerks for skipping line or c) in the know and didn't feel like waiting in line like a rube We ordered a dish off the chefs special menu which was mushrooms, bamboo and sausage. When it arrived there was no sausage. When we flagged down the waitress after some confusion she devised the story that the translation of sausage was asparagus. So she did not say sorry and come back with the sausage she instead insults our meager intelligence. I'd like to point out that one side of menu is written in Chinese characters then in English on other side. So even if there was some regional dialect in which the word sausage somehow meant asparagus, it feels ludicrous to even type that, then why would the English translation say \"sausage\"? The explanation itself made no sense not to mention this type of confusion would happen 12x a night if that were the case. What kind of maniac would just automatically assume sausage actually meant asparagus? The mere man hours involved in handling all the complaints would require a quick menu revision. ANYWAY, since it was so tasty we overlooked it but I'm fairly sure not everyone would just be cool with such a dumb explanation, non apology. Ping Pang Pong is like the good looking person who can get away with being a jerk because they are so attractive. I'll probably go back but as soon as the food quality slips some this place will be a ghost town much like the aging beauty who treated people like servants her whole life",

(Yes, there seems to be a line there. Always.)  The place is loud and busy, and nothing too fancy- wouldn't be much a date spot, but delicious to go for lunch or dinner with a friend. servers come by with carts of many dish options and you can choose which small plates you would like to get.  We ordered about 4-5 plates and the bill was about $30.  Overall, very good, affordable, and a fun dining experience.",

I've been to kJ kitchen in rio casino, chang's, fortune, orchid and other that I forgot the name.. And none of them come close to PPP... They have a wide varieties to choose from the karts, I've taken pics of the one I always order.. Egg custard is by far the best and sesame seed ball.. The price is the same as all the other dim sum restaurant.  I don't recommend their regular menu items, nothing stand out. Not much in the flavor department.",

This place has such bad organizations, we ordered our food for to-go and waited over an hr for the food to be ready.  The waitresses did not bother to tell us if our food was ready or not or any update on it. It is ridiculous of how long they make us wait. I was so upset, it's not even funny.  We asked them to check on our food and the lady in the picture that I took kept ignoring us.  I don't know why it takes them this long to cook the food bc it took them OVER AN HOUR to do it.  I love this place but they're just so rude to us.  We were ignored and they were not friendly about it either.  I've worked with customers and you apologize and give them an update.  Idk maybe it's just that day, maybe it's just the waitresses that was working at the moment.  Hope this helps.",

Specifically, we ordered Mongolian Beef, Sweet & Sour Pork, Walnut Shrimp, Potstickers, and Chicken Stir Fried Noodles, and each offering was the best version of that dish that we have found, after trying about a dozen other Chinese restaurants.  With plenty left over for dinner at home the next night, the whole tab came to just $60.  We would make this our go to Chinese restaurant for take out as well as for dining in, except that parking at the Gold Coast is a little inconvenient if all you are doing is popping in to pick up an order.  A lot of the reviews here characterize PPP's cuisine as \"authentic.\"  I have no idea what that means.  I've only spent a couple of weeks in China, but nothing I ate there bears any resemblance to our dinner at PPP.  As far as I'm concerned this is Americanized Chinese food, and that is just what I want.  If you want to make it as \"authentic\" as the Chinese family-owned restaurants on Spring Mountain (aka Chinatown), just remove most of the protein from each dish and replace it with overcooked vegetables, sodium and MSG.  For my taste, though, I like it just the way they are serving it at PPP.",

Nestled inside the Gold Coast Casino, this restaurant seemed extremely popular, after about an hour wait we were finally seated.   The carts came around fairly quickly, so we were able to eat right away. The food itself was pretty standard and comparable to any other dim sum restaurant. However, my favorite item bolo bao was definitely not the same and I was unfortunately dissapointed. It was only bread with no custard filling and the custard baked on top was extremely hard.   Service was prompt and though there was a bit of a communication barrier, they were polite and willing to help figure out what we needed/wanted.   Price was decent and actually considering all the food we got it wasn't as expensive as I was expecting. Overall, I wouldnt be against going back.",

Without even a second thought, the best dish was the soy sauce chow mein.  I was blown away that the dish had more noodles than bean sprouts.  Normally, it is the other way around.    The service was adequate.  There was nothing that the staff did that blew my mind.  There were three carts that the servers kept pushing around, trying to unload all the old dishes.  The food that we received were not fresh.  For example, the contents of the lotus leaf were completely soggy.  The rice was stuck to the leaf, making it nearly impossible to eat.    Would I come back again?  Maybe.  Better dim sum can be easily found elsewhere.",

It wasn't hard to find on the casino floor and we didn't have to wait long to get a table. It was a little confusing ordering as the wait staff flew here and there. Even as we got our food, it was a little confusing and not personal.  I ordered pork belly stew thinking it was going to be an individual size dish. It wasn't. It was on a dish meant for everyone to eat off of. I tried my family's dishes as well as the dim sum they ordered and it was delicious. THe pork belly stew though was out of this world and when I took it home for leftovers because I couldn't finish everything at the restaurant. Even as leftovers, the pork belly stew was phenomenal and I ate that bad boy all up until it was gone.  The food was delicious and I'd definitely eat it again. The customer service though wasn't that great and that knocked off a star for me.",

Food: The food was good but it was nothing special. The only thing I thought was really good was the steamed bbq pork buns which were really moist. Only thing was that they stuck to the paper and fell apart a bit. There was a decent selection of dim sum but not that many. The shimp dumplings and shrimp rice rolls were not very flavorful.  Service: Not the best dim sum service I have had. The carts took a while to come by and some carts came by more times than others. I had to grab the servers' attention to get drink order refills.  Price. A lot pricier than the other dim sum places I have been. I paid $45 for food that would usually cost 26 to 35 elsewhere.   Overall, the dim sum was okay but I don't think I want to go back (there are other places to go).",

    "text": "I met a friend from Canada for dinner at Ping Pang Pong tonight.  My only other dining experience here was with the same friend about 4 years ago.  We ordered three dishes to share:  The Singapore rice noodles were excellent.  There was a fair number of shrimp and some small slices of pork along with onions.  The curry flavor was good.  For my taste, I could have used a bit more.  We got an order of wrinkled green beans.  I don't think they were seared as much as they should have been to make them wrinkled.  They were crisp.  Their flavor was very good.  Finally, we got the half roasted Cantonese duck.  The flavor of the duck was a winner, too!  I'm not a big fan of duck when it's on the bone, but this was cooked well.    Service was good.  My iced tea refilled often without asking.  We did have to ask a server to bring us some clean plates so we could get rid of some of the duck bones.    The one drawback of Ping Pang Pong was the loudness of the place for the first 1/3 of the hour and a half we were there.  It was so noisy from people talking loudly and the kitchen staff, filling orders for take out and yelling the orders to each other.  I do like the place and I will be back if only for the Singapore noodles.  That was my highlight of the meal!  PS:  I love the name.  I can't help think of Puccini and Turandot!  Addio amore, addio razza....",

You have to hunt the server down before they come to refill your drinks or to see if you need anything else (like napkins, utensils, etc.) I find that to be VERY annoying. They seem pretty annoyed when you ask them something too. Um, if I wanted to serve myself and prepare din on my own... I would have just ate at home. They need to clean this place up too. Is disgustingly dirty. I watched them \"wash\" their plates. This man just rinsed the plates with boiling, hot water. Omg, ew.   One star is for their food. It comes out hot and fresh.

Oh and the wontons were some of the best that Ive had. Alas....this was not enough happiness to make up for the fact that I waited almost an hour (behind 5 different families) just to eat. While waiting I stood there watching multiple tables just kind of sitting there. Napkins on there plates. Just drinking water. They were there while I waited in line and they were there when I paid my receipt. It was absolutely ridiculous. They literally sat there for 2 hours watching all the people waiting in line to get into this place to eat.   If the food was just a tiny bit better I dont think I would have been so annoyed. Im giving this place 3 stars because somebody should have told these people to order some food or get out. It was ridiculous.",

    "text": "This is the first time I've found good food off the strip. Really good chinese food for the price. After playing bingo, yes we played bingo :P ... we were hungry and I read decent reviews on yelp.. Where else in Vegas can you find good food at these prices?? I went to Noodles @ the Bellagio the next night and spent twice as much and the food was just okay.  My friend had the Walnut Prawns and I ordered the Classic Cantonese Brisket Stew. My mom makes a great brisket chinese style of course with tendon. This version was pretty good, quite flavorful, had a perfect balance of meat, tendon was so soft and big pieces of turnip as well. My friend thought it was missing something... My mom usually puts dried orange peel, but I thought it was fine without it. His prawns were okay, perhaps a bit too small so the shrimps weren't as meaty. The honey glazed walnuts weren't as good. We usually get this dish at our local chinese restaurant and it's so good! I opted for a pot of tea while my friend got a coke. The tea was quite bland with just one cheap tea bag floating inside. Thank goodness I was staying at the Mandarin Oriental and snagged a couple of quality tea bags. Made a more enjoyable pot of tea.  Dinner for two was just $35 with tip, a bargain even off the strip! We really would've gone back a 2nd time had it not been so far away...",

    "text": "My last few visits to Ping Pang Pong have been less than stellar.  Sure, I really thought they were the best dim sum experience in Vegas (compared to the other few we have), but they have been going downhill since that very first visit (and review).    First off, there aren't that many dishes offered anymore!  They used to have a larger variety and now they are lacking!  They don't even offer the Big F's favorite - the Macanese egg tart, which really puts a damper on things.  (They apparently are trying out this new egg souffle dish instead.)  I haven't seen the pickled pig's feet ever again as well.  Blah!  Service was pretty horrible too.  I thought it was because I get dumped at the corner table all the time, but I just think it sucks.  The last time we ate there (last month), we didn't even have all our dishes and serving utensils before the dim sum arrived.  It took awhile to wave down a waiter and get some tea.  We ordered a plate of Singapore noodles and that took forever to come out as well.    And it's so random when it's busy.  On one Saturday I went, there was no wait.  And then other times it's a good half an hour wait for a party of four.  You just never know.  However, I have since requested that we go back and try the other dim sum places in Vegas again since PPP leaves me less than happy and not satisfied.  (The Big F claims that when he went without me, they had tons of stuff coming out!  Maybe I'm bad luck or something!)",

    "text": "You know, considering the casino, this place is pretty good. I cam here for both dinner and lunch. Surprisingly enough, they had dim sum on a Monday during lunch (?), which I thought was normally a weekend thing. I suppose that they get so many people (being in Vegas and all) plus all the Chinese tourists that they can afford to do so.  Their Chow Fun is exceptionally good (I always order it and use it as a judge for Chinese restaurants). They translated it into \"Rice noodle.\" This was not as... err... random as their \"Wrinkled Beans...\" It doesn't sound appetizing, but it's name in other restaurants is \"Dry Braised String Beans,\" or something similar. Both of these dishes are good. I also tried their lamb and duck, both were good (if somewhat overpriced).  Their service is pretty good too, considering it could be a lot worse. They serve hot tea automatically like a Chinese restaurant should. Dim sum was kind of slow when I went with only 3 carts and a few waiters with trays (but again, since it was a weekday, that's to be expected).  The super high rating is due to the fact that it is literally in the middle of the casino. It's not some fusion crap that other casinos on the strip sell. Nor is it some Panda Express imitation. Nope. No longer must I take a trip to Chinatown to get my fix. I can play my Monopoly slots, place my sports bets, grab some Chow Fun with my winnings, and then lose it all on craps... all on the same floor. Now that's Vegas....",

Anyways, Howard T, myself and a few other guys went here because my friend (the same friend who insisted on going on the 95 to get to Oyshi Sushi) had a $90 food credit.  There is no way that 5 guys can go through $90 worth of dim sum, right?  WRONG.  DEAD WRONG.  There were 5 of us guys and 4 of us weighed more than 180 lbs each.  We can eat.  We can eat A LOT.  Especially for dim sum.  It only helps that their dim sum is tasty.  Sure the portions are a little smaller and the prices are a bit more expensive than those you'd find at Chinatown, but they're still good.",

I've been to other places in town (Chang's, Orchid Garden, Cathay House) and this place beats them all! I would even compare it to some of the great dim sum places they have in Chinatown in San Francisco or Los Angeles. The classical dim sum dishes (pork buns, egg tarts, shui mei) all deliver, plus they have some other unique concoctions as well.  The ambiance is great too.  I love sitting in a crowded little dim sum place, with the chatter of happy families eating together, surrounded by beautiful paintings and really great lighting!  They also have an open kitchen too which is pretty neat!  If you're looking for some good dim sum in Las Vegas, then this is the place to go :)",

THE WAIT! I can't believe we actually stuck around for an hour for a table at this place. I guess we were really desperate for dimsum. Everything we tried here was delicious!! Except for their crispy shrimp balls.  2 Orders Siu Mai - YUM 2 Orders Har Gow - YUM! Chinese Broccoli (they put the oyster sauce on the side) - YUM!  Taro Dumping - YUM! Long Noodle Roll - YUM! I wish they would've put more sauce on it though. Crispy Shrimp Balls - Mehhh.. They were tiny and covered with sliced almonds? instead of crispy noodles. :( Not worth it, and didn't come with sweet and sour sauce.    I'm not sure if that's all we've ordered but it was definitely delicious! Came out to $32 bucks excluding tip! Good for two people! But the wait was horrendous!  I wanted to come here again before my flight in the morning but they only serve dimsum daily from 10am-3pm BOOO!!!!!",

The salt and pepper shrimp and the spicy tofu, pork, and shrimp balls were spiced ever so right - both came with generous doses of cilantro and jalepenos.  Quite the combination and they made my taste buds cry out in joy.  The plain shrimp balls and thin noodles were nicely done.  Very nicely - the plate was heaping, and we were each able to get 4 portions out of it.  We also tried the pork and vegetable balls which were heavenly.  I can't forget about the shrimp balls coated with roe - it was as if the sea had walked off the plate into my mouth.  The pot stickers were packed with meat and were so tasty, it was a shame we could only stuff 3 of them into our already full bellies.  And finally, the sesame balls - oh my goodness!

    "text": "People in Las Vegas are usually too drunk or just not smart enough to realize what bad service looks like.   I have been coming here for 3 years because the Gold Coast comps me all the time. The Food has always been 5-stars, but the service is so bad that in the last 2 years, I have NEVER left a tip. And everyone around this town knows I am a big tipper. I mean, my local sushi spot is a place in NW Las Vegas called \"Sushi Bomb\". The chefs and servers are so friendly and nice to me that even though my bill comes out to $32.00, I will pay with a $100 and tell them to keep the change. So Yes, I am not afraid to tip if the service is that good.   What is wrong with Ping Pang Pong? At 1st I thought it was a cultural misunderstanding. I noticed that most the workers speak barely any English and most are from Mainland China and not Taiwan(Taiwanese restaurants are always much more friendly). But, even other Chinese people who come here get into big fights with the servers and complain all the time about how bad the service is.   Common problems here:  -You go up to the counter and wait for the host to seat you or put you on the list. 15 minutes later, the host will not come over. She won't even give you eye contact or say: \"I will be right with you\". When the host finally comes she doesn't even know how to seat you. You would think that since this has been her job for the last 2-3 years she would have finally figured out how to do it right, but somehow she still hasn't got it down. Common sense says that the person at the front of the line should be the person you should service, but she will just pick a random person at times.  -Many times(and this happens a lot) a drunk from the casino who doesn't have the coherency to stand in line will attempt to cut infront of you. The server WILL seat him instead even though you shout at her that the drunk cut in line.  -After waiting about 40minutes, you will get seated. After that you will have to wait another 15-20 minutes for your server to come take you order.  -Another 35-40minutes later your food will finally arrive. Sometimes(and this happens a lot also) your food will NEVER arrive, and you will have to complain to the servers. They somehow lose your orders a lot here. If your order does come, many times the order will be WRONG. This is a headache because now you will have to wait another 30 minutes for the right one to come out. -Once the server takes your order, you will NEVER see another server come around ever again. If you want srirachi or water...tough luck because no ones is gonna get it for you! No one will ever even come around 1 time to check up on you or ask you if there is anything you need. Yet, these people still expect a tip? -If there is a mistake with the bill(example-they charged you for something you didn't order-And this happens here a lot too), the staff speaks such limited English that is will take forever for you to get them to understand  what your problems is.  Now the thing I see a lot is that many people will complain about all of the things I listed above. They will complain about how bad the service is, yet they will still leave a tip! By leaving a tip you are just encouraging them to keep up their rude, lazy and incompetent service.  Okay I will admit that The food here at Ping Pang Pong is the best Chinese Food in the world....So it is only justified that the service should meet up to the standards of how good the food is. So my solution to end the bad service here for good is to STOP TIPPING until they learn.   I know the management reads these things. They know who I am. I am the guy who wears the Burberry Coats and I usually show up with  2 extremely tall Japanese and Korean-Americans. We come almost every week.  .....btw, the service is so slow that expect to be here for 2-3 hours.",

It was just tea, water, and 3 beers.   We definitely recommend these dishes as we ordered seconds and thirds: Crisp Chicken, Combination Fried Rice, Seafood Chow fun w/gravy, and Manila Clams w/Black Bean sauce (could use more clams though).   Service was ok. I mean could've been better, but that happens when the restaurant gets busy and what not. So it's a little understandable. But no complaints because we still got everything we ordered and wanted in a timely manner. Definitely hitting up this place again when we head out to Vegas again.  Would've love to have tried the Dim Sum, but the line was crazy long, and they were seating people out of order.

Only thing we tried that I didn't like was this spicy chow fun dish, it was flavorless. Also I wish they offered sate chili oil instead of red chili paste. Knocking off a star because they don't use sprays when wiping down tables, just the same gross rags (luckily I always have baby wipes on hand to wipe our table). Knocking off another star because it's in a casino and I hate having to come through smoking areas just to dine and leave smelling like smoke.",

    "text": "We were looking for a Chinese Restaurant that serves Dim Sum late.  We stumbled across this restaurant in the Gold Coast Casino around 1:30 am.  At first we didn't know if they were closing.  No one acknowledged us for a good five (felt like 10) minutes, and nobody else was waiting.  There was no staff in sight to welcome us or take our name.  Right before walking away, someone finally confronts us.  Because we were hungry and lazy, we ended up waiting another 5 minutes since the place was packed.    Once we sat down, service was tolerable.  Our drink refills came frequently, and the food was prepared quickly.  We got our Dim Sum fix with Shu Mai and Hargow...pretty average.  Everything else (Fu Chow Fried Rice, Black Pepper Beef, Kung Pau Chicken, and Walnut Prawns) exceeded the standard except for the Hot & Sour Soup.    Bad start...but good finish..",

Fortunately, it was a fluke. Ping Pang Pong was DANG near as good as our usual haunt in Portland. The service was good, the food was great, and specialty items were quickly cooked and served to us if they weren't already on the carts. My favorite little indulgence here was the coconut custard bun. Ambrosia! Another of our favorite dim sum stables is the stuffed eggplant, har gow, and sui mai- Ping Pang Pong delivered on all of them!",

    "text": "Food is okay, but like a lot of typical dim sum places the service is garbage. I've been to enough dim sum places in San Francisco, Seattle, and Vegas to know that they don't have enough carts going around to service everyone in a timely manner. We got there well before 3. The cart arrived once without some of the \"basic\" selections like Shu Mai and Har Gow. We specifically asked for the items, to which they said they'd be back with them. We then waited 20 minutes, and when we asked for it again they gave us the excuse that they weren't doing dim sum anymore. It took a chat with the manager for us to finally get some Shu Mai that looked like it was under a heat lamp for an hour. I posted a picture of it so you can see for yourself.   At dim sum places you usually have to be patient and go with the flow as barely controlled chaos is how they get things done. Usually, the experience is fun and more than satisfying. However, even with that said, I'd only recommend this place if you were hard up to find an alternative.",

We went back the next morning but they weren't open and then we went back a third time and then had to wait a while and they did not notice anyone in line waiting for a table. We ordered out as it had gotten busy with all Chinese people celebrating the day after Chinese New Year. The food took quite a while (we could have eaten a lot if we had just sat down), a few dishes I wanted like egg tart, sponge cake, leaf wrapped rice, they did not have but overall their dim sum was really good. They have won best Asian 2009 which is quite a feat for most restaurants.   Their baked BBQ pork buns were so fresh and tasty I had dreams about them only 1/2 hour after eating them. Because of these buns I am willing to take a bit of abuse from lousy service. Their pineapple  buns and custard baked buns were also really fresh. Their steamed BBQ pork and custard buns were good too. Their beef rice roll was small but good and their beef balls were only OK.   They had tons of authentic style dishes that my parents would love (but I don't), in fact I will tell them to stay at this hotel so that they can be close to their own food as they always complain they can't get any decent chinese rice anywhere.  I will definitely be back to try more and actually sit at a table when it's not so busy.",

    "text": "Ping Pang Pong is definitely one of my top choices for dim sum here in Vegas.    First, the restaurant is small so it doesn't take too terribly long for the carts to circulate and deliver piping hot dim sum foods to you!  I am not a fan of luke warm dim sum.  This is often a problem when a place isn't busy and things circulate for too long or when a place is too big and the carts have travel vast distances from kitchen to patron.    They offer all of my faves like chinese broccoli with oyster sauce, baked char shiu bau (sp?), shrimp and chive nuggets, crab balls, chow fun, shiu mai (sp?).  OK, OK I admit I have absolutely no idea how to name or spell most of the hot tiny treasures but I love to eat them!  One complaint here at ping pang pong, is that they serve the oyster sauce on the side of the chinese broccoli....I must prefer a heart drizzle evenly over the top.    They are friendlier than most but still the service is abrupt, semi-angry, and without any normal pleasantries.  This is to be expected from most Chinese establishments, especially dim sum.  But the attitude adds to the experience if you ask me!    If it is your first crack at dim sum, this may be the best place to try it.  The ladies pushing the carts even explained what was in some of the items!  Revolutionary.    Dim sum at ping pang pong is better than most here in town but not the best ever, but definitely worth a try!!!",

If you don't see what you're looking for in the carts please be sure to just order it and they will bring to you when its done.

What I ordered today: salt and pepper porkchop- was hot, crispy,juicy and had the right amount of salt.  Walnut shrimp: sweet,savory and juicy not too salty like some other places and the shrimp were pretty big this time and the sauce was creamy and not watery like at other places.  Salt and pepper fried tofu: crispy, perfect seasoning and moist inside  Pan fried noodles with beef: the sauce was amazing,thick and there was a good amount of Beef and bok choi.  Would totally recommend!",

They even have the menu options written in Chinese.  I had the Kung pao chicken. It was not similar to the Kung pao I've had in the past, as the sauce was thinner and there was not a lot of vegetables or peanuts in the sauce. Other than that I did think it was tasty, but I was not blown away. I must say the service was very good here. The servers came to the table often and you did not have to wait long for a drink.",

You are seated based on the available table so a whole bunch of folks behind us were seated before us. I guess a party of 5 is too small for a table of 6. Dim sum is good with the typical offerings you would find elsewhere. Service was so-so as the place is pretty busy. I'd eat here again IF we're close by. Otherwise, I'm not convinced this is our go-to and will continue our search for our favorite LV dim sum joint.",

I've never been this upset at waiters and waitresses. They were rude and even when I explained I was just following what the other waitress had said, the guy and another waitress have me the look like I was trash and proceeded to make me feel even worse. Never coming back again.   As for the food, I came to try the shumai, the pork ones and har gow which are the shrimp dumplings after reading many good reviews and my friends telling me about this place. Aside from the service, the food itself was nothing outstanding. The taste was alright for the shrimp dumplings but for the shumai, it was like chewing malleable rubber. Each dumpling was like a small toy! I think that surprised me the most. For those who want to try dimsum and absolutely can't get any better, this place is okay, but for sure, there are much better options for me here in SoCal.",

Right at 10, we were seated, carts were being pushed already. Service was great, water was constantly full, tea was refilled constantly, our table always had food and carts coming to make sure it stayed that way.   We had shumai & hargow. Obvious must gets. They were fantastic. Our tables favorite was the shrimp with the sugar cane and mayo dipping sauce. We ordered beef ribs, chicken feet, a rice dish with Chinese broccoli chicken feet & ribs, and we also tried some dishes I haven't seen at other dim sum places. Everything was delicious. We got fried tofu which was my least favorite but even being a non tofu eater, it was enjoyable. We got mango pudding and a coconut dessert shaped as fishes. Those were delicious. If you are planning to go here early, I would eat here slow. All the options aren't ready right at opening so when we were super stuffed and ready to leave, we saw fried turnip, chow fun and a bunch of other goodies.   For a table of 5 really stuffed people, we spent just barely over $100 which was a pretty decent price. Would definitely recommend and come back if I'm in Vegas.",

    "text": "Ping Pang Pong renovated to the larger location you see now, and oh man, it's way better now than when I went pre-renovation. It's like the classic Chinese restaurant that you go to when your family is in town and they're craving classic family style dishes.  The dim sum in the morning is pretty decent with average prices for each dish. The staples (shu mai, har gow, etc) are pretty good. The wrapper for har gow was slightly chewy with some bite to it while the shu mai had a good interior texture. It's warm, steamy, and savory-- everything you could ask for in dim sum.   For the dinner menu, we got the salt and pepper pork chop and string beans. The pork chop had a crispy exterior and the meat itself wasn't overcooked. No complaints from me about the salt and pepper pork. The price point is a little high for what you get though.   Overall, Ping Pang Pong is a good restaurant when you're looking for class family style Chinese dishes. If you're looking for American Chinese food (orange chicken, broccoli beef, etc), this place may not be right for you.",

Until I noticed the manager that we have not been served then we got some foods. The foods were alright. I like their egg tarts and shu mai. The Haw Gao is a bit tough.  Moreover, we came in as a family of 20, in 2 slit checks and they had a mistake on the 2nd check, where they over charged. It took us extra time to have that fit too. I would not come back!",

We were seated immediately luckily since we got there about 15 minimum after they opened on a Sunday morning.    The line gets long so go early or prepare to wait.   Got our drinks quickly but several carts later we were still waiting for the shu mai carts to make it's way passed us.   Saw the egg custard lady about 3 times in 5 minutes.    Finally flagged her down, but by then she ran out of shu mai!  At least we got our shrimp har gow and put our order in.    Ordered off the menu as you can't eat Chinese food with the house special pan fried noodles!   Get the gobo beef too and you won't be disappointed.     My brother kept raving about these almond cookies which were not on the menu.  They actually have them at the front desk.   The cookies are legit.  Order some to eat there and a pack of three to go.",

The place was awesome and very clean and decorative.  For starters we have Pork buns which were soooo good. My grandparents ordered his usual order chicken Lo Mein and Bitter Melon with Beef. The rest of my family and I did ordered Singapore Noodles and Orange Chicken. The food was delicious I loved the Orange Chicken and Lo Mein. I didn't eat too much of of the Bitter Melon, apparently its a thing in some asian cultures I personally didn't like it.  We had hot tea but I saw on the menu they made Guava Green Tea I gave it a try it tasted delicious.  My family and I are definitely coming back. The best Chinese restaurant that I think it's the best in Las Vegas. I highly recommend coming here!",

    "text": "This review is more about their service than food and ambiance. In all of Vegas, this restaurant has the worst customer service, hands down. I was never offered a refill for water. I had to ask for napkins. When I went to pay I had to ask 3 times. And this was with no line! In addition it was towards the end of the dim sum shift!  Now on to their food, in Vegas they have the best dim sum. Their congee is clean with no heavy MSG. Their Ha Gow has good shape: when you poke your chopsticks into it it doesn't crumble easily. (Sign of a good dim sum chef) the spare ribs had the right blend of pepper and texture. One of their delicacies, the pork stomach was surprisingly flavorful without the usual slimemeness of animal organs. Overall, dim sum (not dinner) is top notch despite bad service and being 15 percent more expensive than their competitors.  Today was the first day I have been here since their remodeling a few years ago. It's more spacious, more classy and the lighting much better. Definitely come here for dim sum, but don't expect service.",

Not sure what it tasted like)  Everything tasted good!! Love the shumai, dimsum, chicken feet, rice with chicken the best.   Pork bao was good just was not wow'd.

They were alright. Dim sum prices are standard maybe even on the cheaper side and food overall was fair pricing. Service really sucked though. Dim sum ladies came and then disappeared for fifteen minutes. There were no servers around to take our order for off the cart foods.

I always knew this place existed, but never gave it any serious thought because at first, I thought the name sounded racist. It reminded me of the derogatory term, \"ching chang chong,\" which initially turned me off. After speaking to some friends who recommended that I should give it a try, I decided to finally check it out due to my dim sum cravings.   The quality of the food here is exceptional, and the dim sum carts come frequent and fast. It got to the point where I had to constantly tell the cart aunties \"no\" on numerous occasions because they were so frequent. It didn't feel pushy though. It felt more like they wanted to make sure you got everything you needed and craved.   The highlight of the meal was the custard bun I had at the end. I'm not a huge fan of sweets, but oh man, these buns were heaven sent. They were so good that I had to order two more plates of them to take home and eat and savor in private later in the comfort of my home.   The fact that it was inside the Gold Coast was a nice addition. I spent the rest of the afternoon burning some of the food off bowling and playing countless hands of baccarat.   If you're craving good old fashion dim sum via push carts, come here and check it out.",

The good news is the place opens at 10:00 am, which was perfect for my jet lagged body. I arrived around 10:15 and was promptly seated. By 11:00 there was a waiting line.  I got spring rolls for appetizer which easily rated a 4 star. And black bean chicken for main course (pic included). It had green peppers and scallions, but the veggies were luke warm, guess they didn't get stir fried enough. Solid 3 star. Service was ok. But could understand the dim sum servers getting burned out by dinner time as 1001 folks said no, after they explained what was on their cart. Most of my fellow dinners were Asian and heard a fair bit of Cantonese.  Nothing to do with the restaurant, but how I got there was an adventure. I am staying at Caesar's, and decided to walk the mile to PPP. Busy flamingo road and you cross the expressway at busy intersection. Several street people sleeping on section of the sidewalk that curves away from the road. Sad to see. Decided to take a cab back.  PPP is shadow of it's former self, but still deserves a visit.",

I got some porridge since I had been sick, and it was helped me feel better, love the crispy wontons. I was pretty stuffed.  Dimsum for two.. about $30, pretty reasonable, or average, depends on how you look at it, and how much you eat. It was nice to have dimsum in LV, but it was just okay.  Nothing to rave about.

Also, there can be some serious language barriers at times, but if it looks good it probably is good and eventually you'll learn what everything is.

We saw a lot of take out orders, so maybe next time we will try that.  The prices were very reasonable and the dishes were generous and tasty.

The food is definitely authentic tasting, but it was very salty for my liking.  The black bean chicken was recommended by the manager waiting on us, and it was a bad a call. Sounded good, but it turned out not to be so great. Nonetheless when we ate all three items together the food didn't taste so bad.  Still, its definitely not AWARD winning like they paint themselves to be. I wouldn't mind eating here again: as long as I order something different.  I think our biggest mistake was ordering the fried rice. If we had white rice instead, and ordered two other meat dishes other than the black bean chicken it would have been fine.  Maybe i'll do that next time.  This restaurant definitely has potential, we just made poor choices in ordering our food.  Our fault. Service was good. A-Ok.",

    "text": "Absolutely enjoy dining in an atmosphere that reminds me of HongKong as a child vacationing with my Mom & Dad. The wait in the line to get a table and seating is not bothersome as watching the activity in the restaurant and seeing the Chinese cooks in their crisp white chef garbs before chinese woks and hot fire, all viewable in the open cooking area. These Chinese cooks whip up authentic Chinese menu! The food servers there to serve and aid in choosing from the menu and answer meal questions. Authentic Chinese cuisine, in that it is not Americanized Chinese food. From seafood, to vegetables, soups, main meat meals and dessert, it could never been any less filling. Best recommendation is to try each and every entree in the menu. In as much as I return dining in this restaurant located inside the Gold Coast Hotel and Casino of the west side of Entertainment City, I have a constant pick which you may want to try. For starters, savor the taste of Savory Minced Squab and Pork Tenderloin (served with hoisin sauce). A Provincial favorite dish is Double-Braised Scallop Hot Pot (whole seared scallops simmering in garlic oyster sauce served in a sealed clay pot) which is just tasteful. A favorite dish is the Singapore Rice Noodles with a taste of curry that reminds me definitely of SIngapore (with vermicelli. shrimp, BBQ pork, onions). Serve me Duck and it sticks in my palate even after it's off the plate into the tummy filling: Plum-Orange Braised Leg of Duck or the Cantonese Roast Duck (Half). The Lobster and Vermicelli Clay Pot steaming in broth, or the Emperor's Seafood Stew (sun-dried abalone, fish maw with supreme sea cucumber all simmered in flavorful broth) or the Manila Clams with Black Bean Sauce definitely sends me to seafood heaven. Develop a taste for the very appetizingly filling Clay Pot & Congee meals is a definite choice: Ginger Mushroom Chicken Rice or the Sausage Duck Confit Rice. For Rice dishes, I always order Cantonese Curry Beef Brisket Stew, or the Chow Fried Rice (with BBQ pork, green onions and shrimp), or the spicy Night Market Fried Rice (with sliced beef, fresh Thai chilies, diced tomatoes, bean sprouts), or Fu Chow Fried Rice (mixed seafood sauteed in a light scallion gravy) or the Pineapple Seafood Fried Rice (which reminds me of being in the islands). A vegetable favorite is Sauteed Lotus Root (thinly sliced in an sweet and pungent sauce), or the Snow Pea Leaves with Roasted Garlic. Highly recommend \"Dim Sum\" as it is for me the best bang for your bucks in this entertainment city! A wide array presented in rolling carts pushed around by chinese-garbed food servers all too willing for passing it on to your table from the dim sum cart. Ready for small eats that leaves you wanting more, go Dim Sum! Dim Sum dining is at lunch time. As I have experienced dining here as often as possible, see for yourself why it's been voted many times as \"one of the top 10 Chinese restaurants in America\" by Travel + Leisure magazine and \"Best Asian Restaurant in Las Vegas\" by readers of the Las Vegas Review-Journal! China has never been closer at Ping Pang Pong! Ha, that's a hit!",

Named one of the top 10 Chinese restaurants in America by Travel + Leisure magazine and  \"Best Asian Restaurant in Las Vegas\" six times by readers of the Las Vegas Review-Journal? Really? They sure did not sparkle on 8/13/13. My date said \"They must be resting on their laurels\". The food was just ok. Nothing special there. The floor was sticky. Gnats buzzed around our table all visit. Uniformed employees ate at the table next to us. The thing that stuck in my mind is the terrible service. The (Spanish?) server who took our drink order did not know the name of the only chardonnay on the menu. Our meal server never returned to ask us if everything was ok. In fact she disappeared for good after our order was placed. Eventually we had to flag down some one who was serving other tables in our section to help us. It is not like they were over busy at 8pm on a Tuesday night. I even passed on dessert, completely un-heard of for me, due to the lack of attention we received.",

(see pics)  --------- While in Vegas earlier this week, we were craving some authentic dim sum and trusted that the YELP community would steer us in the right direction.  After some reading we decided on Ping Pang Pong.    I will be honest, the name gave reason for hesitation... the location (gold coast casino?) lead to some more doubt...  Boy were we wrong!

First off, the seating procedure is absolutely terrible. You wait in a line with a bunch of other people, whose parties can range from a small group of two to a large group of eight. Yet no one comes to sort out these groups and so because that group of eight is going to wait forever, you're waiting forever with them.   When you're finally seated, you notice that there are two different rooms. If you're lucky, you'll be in the room near the kitchen, and you'll get your food. If not, you'll be waiting forever only to realize that those ladies with the carts are only going around the first room.   However, I will say that their food is pretty good. Of all the dim sum I've tried in Vegas, this is probably the best one. They have a pretty good selection of dim sum, although I would say that their tripe is not that great. But I do really like their other dishes.  All in all, a good place for the food but you're going to have to suffer through the terrible service.",

    "text": "Came here with a friend for a dim sum lunch late Monday morning, and it was already packed with a short line of customers waiting.  The wait was about 15 minutes before we were seated at a table.  Service here is decent, with about 4 to 5 carts of dim sum items to choose from.  Selection was good, but the quality of the dim sum is both good and bad.  Good is good, not great, as the dishes we enjoyed didn't wow us tremendously.  The bad dishes, unfortunately, left a lasting impression.  The included the following:  - Roast Pork - Though the skin was rather crispy, you can tell by the color and texture of the meat that it was reaheated.  It was not fresh despite the fact the cart lady chimed that the roast pork just came out of the oven/fire.  - Siu Mai - These steamed dumplings are traditionally made with seasoned ground pork, shitake mushrooms and shrimp.  There was no shrimp in these, and some of the siu mais were prepared in the way where a couple of them were dense, dry and hard to the chew.    - Chinese Broccoli - The dish we got had broccoli that was not as thick as the ones on the other dish.  Chinese Broccoli, as it grows older, the stalks get thicker and the inside turns from translucent (tender) to white (old).  We needed some greens to balance the meal and tried this.  Aside from the issue with the age of the broccoli used, the preparation was fine.  But older broccoli is harder to chew through and can be awfully fibrous.  - XO Sauce Pan-Fried Rice Noodle Rolls - Seasoned well, but could have used more XO Sauce to give it a spicy kick.  The problem with the dish we got was that it was the last of it's type on a cart, uncovered, and must have sat on that cart for awhile.  It was cold, not as flavorful, and cold rice noodles dry up and harden.  Best to ask to test the temperature of the plate or dish these more exotic dim sum dishes are served on so that you can figure out if it's relatively fresh, or if it's been sitting around for a while.  Prices are higher, as expected, since this is a hotel restaurant.  With other dim sum palaces in Vegas, we probably won't be back.  It's OK to good, but there are better.",

The other was a 3 Mushroom dish which was also good. Been here several times before and I always liked it. The prices are reasonable. 3 stars today because somehow, the dishes seemed to lack flavor which I like during my previous visits. I liked them but something flavorwise, seemed to be missing today. I will definitely return snd re-assess the food flavors...",

The carts start coming  but then (crickets... ... .. . ...)  Why are the  carts empty? Why are there no beef balls or congee available? Then we ordered and I am a huge DIM SUM advocate and I rarely say bad things about restaurants.  But the attitude from the cart pushers are bad.  Our congee came in old tasting and chunky.  We had to ask for it to be changed.  Also, the portions  were small and it did not look fresh. The prices here are ridiculous.  Maybe it's because you are paying for the restaurant location.  The restrooms are outside the restaurant around the corner which is an inconvenience.  I love that the carts have the same food and no one is ordering.  They do not look fresh at all.  Uber small and super expensive.  I rather go to Spring Mountain for food.  But the only plus is that the parking lot is 1 mile away but free (so you get a nice workout to burn off your food).  Overall, this place get's no love from me.  I will not be back.  I hope this was just a bad day.  Sorry guys I don't like this place at all.  By the way did I mention you will be overcharged for something that should cost $1.25 to $2.55 for a dim sum dish.    * Boomsauce scale. BW = Dis $@% is BASURA! (Garbage). Not recommended. BS = it's just O.K. (experience) BS+ = Yo! I like this place. BS++= That's Whoa! This place good. BS+++= Dayumm! This place is fkn DOPE!",

This would have been a 5 star review except for the fact that we have to find our waiter every time  we need something. But it's peak hours and busy so I completely understand. All our food  are palatable.. we're happy!  The steamed Flounder was well-seasoned (you can have them deep fried btw) as we have devoured every edible part of it.. the pork chop and orange chicken are our \"all time family favorites\" along with the must-have- Mama's fave: bitter melon. They offer toothsome Asian deserts as well.  Y-U-M-MY for our tummy! Always come famished when you bring your big appetite to this place!",

If you are looking for a certain dish you can ask the worker and they will find it for you.  I feel like they were extremely accommodating and what made me happy was they had hot oil.  I went to a previous dim sum place inside the rio and it was horrible. They don't use hot oil but a peanut sauce.  Everything taste horrible there but that is another review I will share.   This was prob one of my favorite meals in Vegas with the girls.  We had shrimp dumpling, shumai dumpling, chicken feet, tripe, soup, shrimp noodle, congee soup, sweet tofu with ginger.  Everything was delicious and did not make me hungry.  I wish this place was brought to my attention earlier of our trip.  We are a lot and paid $60 bucks for a bunch of food.

There was the fried flounder, salt and pepper pork chop, spicy tofu with ground beef, deep fried chicken, and some kind of lamb with green onions. Everything on the table was amazing and had really great flavors; highly recommend the salt and pepper pork chop and spicy tofu. And we also go the house special deep fried noodles which was so good we had to order another one in the middle of the meal.

We don't speak Chinese so a lot of sign languages.   Our server was never around. When we wanted to order something on the menu! I had to ask for him 4 times over.   I wouldn't come back to this part of the strip, if it wasn't for us to meet a friend there on my bachelorette trip.",

    "text": "So, the front desk guy at our hotel recommended Ping Pang Pong as the best dim sum in Vegas. He was Chinese and said his family ate there a lot. I had also heard that Gold Coast casino was a good local casino. So a quick Uber ride brought us here for a quick dim sum lunch. It was mid day on Monday and there was no wait. The carts were rolling around and there was also a lunch menu.  The pan fried shrimp, pork and chives dumpling was soooo flavorful. It was piping hot since we got a fresh batch. We also had a few other dishes that were all delicious. Since this was a quick snack for us, we didn't order anything off the lunch menu. We did inquire about their whole lobster with noodle but the price tag of $116 was a bit much for a snack.  Dropped off one star because service was terrible.  Servers were scarce. The bus guys were great, the cart service was good but the main server was probably hiding.  It took 3 requests to finally get water.  Hoping this was not a regular occurrence.",

As soon as they open, they'll have a long ass line wrapping the entrance. Luckily we were able to go before we left Vegas.   the first dish I ordered was their shu-mai or as you may know it as... pork hash! It was simply delectable. My husband is basic AF so he told me to get a fried rice. I had to get chicken fried rice since it sounded simple yet bomb at the same time. It came out good and the portion size was friendly. Last dish was their honey walnut prawns. It's soooooo good !!!!  Service was OK. Waitresses were obviously flustered from how busy it was so didn't really come by to check up on us. At least our waters were filled. This place is kind of pricey but it's like high end dim sum. Worth a try!",

    "text": "All these years living in Vegas and I finally make it to Ping Pang Pong for some midweek Dim Sum lunch for a lunch meeting...  PPP Service & Ambiance:  Attractive contemporary Asian decor right out of a fight scene in a John Wick movie (I dig the giant abacus decor) with tall ceilings to make the dining area appear more spacious.  There is plenty of room to accommodate 100+ diners.  The dim sum service was good, it wasn't hard to locate the cart with the dishes you wanted.  Multiple times we notified the nearest cart attendant what we were looking for and that cart would be sent over quickly.  Well done.  PPP Dim Sum dishes:  Everything I sampled was tasty and fresh.  They had all the 'mainstream' Dim Sum dishes along with some plates I've never come across before.  i.e.  The shrimp balls, covered in almonds and to be dipped in the sweet mayo sauce was was fantastic.  Additionally, some of the carts had some dinner plates so it was like a pseudo fusion of dim sum and dinner entrees.  Ping Pang Pong definitely has a diverse selection of dishes to try.  The prices are slightly higher than dim sum restaurants in the Vegas Valley which I expected considering their casino location and the upscale decor.  However, it's not unreasonable for the extra variety of dishes to choose from and the great quality.  I'l be back to try more dishes when I don't have the time constraints of a business lunch.  Enjoy!",

    "text": "We're new to the area and are establishing our new \"Go To\" list of places to regularly visit. Due to the interesting name we decided that this restaurant needed further investigation.   We parked in the ramp and made the long walk to the restaurant. As we get there we can see a line forming outside - usually a good omen. Luckily we were quickly escorted in (about 20 minutes) to our table.   We explained to our \"waitress\" that this was our first time here. She said she'd be back with our drinks and that we'd get an explanation then. We got our drinks (from someone else) but never saw her again. Instead we had people walking by serving from their carts (okay, I get it. Been to similar places). Each person walking by would ask if we wanted anything from their cart. The unfortunate part is that we were not able to hear any of them as the place was way too loud and English not primary languages for them.   The portions for each plate were too big for an individual, so you'd have to grab a plate with the idea of it needing to be shared. My wife and I have very different tastes when eating at a place such as this. I am by far more adventuresome, and will try most anything. She???? ahhh NO! When you have no clue what is being offered this make things very difficult at best.  We had some rice, noodles, a couple dimsum (total guess what was going to be in them until after I had bite into it), and my wife had some chicken soup. The bill came to over $80.00! The soup was $14.00 alone!  As we were getting ready to leave, we notice that there were some menus that were being handed out to select customers. We are not sure why some were getting menus and others not but these would definitely have helped.  Other than enjoying saying the name of this restaurant, there is nothing worth coming back for. We can say the name anytime we wish to have it roll off our tongues.",

    "text": "The comical name of the restaurant may arouse your curiosity, but the  consistently solid authentic Cantonese food they serve up is what should really lure you into Ping Pang Pong.  Located inside the Gold Coast Casino, it's just a quick few minutes off the Strip, and caters heavily to an Asian clientele.    Whether you're interested in an elaborate fare, or simple chow mein, you'll easily find something here for you.  The menu selection is vast.    My all-time favorite item here is their whole steamed fish.  It's always super fresh.  I prefer the simple, yet flavorful presentation with just ginger, onion and cilantro, which they do very well.  The one downside to this preparation here, though, is that it always seems to be brought to the table with obvious cuts in various parts of the fish, to test for doneness.  It doesn't detract in any way from the taste, but does take away greatly from the aesthetic presentation.    There's also a whole deep fried fish option on the menu, which I've yet had the opportunity to try.  However, I've seen them all over neighboring tables, which is clearly indicative to me that this is a favorite staple here.  On several occasions, I've even seen solo diners here with just one plate of the massive whole fried fish in front of them!  Another outstanding dish was their Shrimp Lai Fen with XO Sauce.  The noodles (lai fen) were deftly hand rolled, and boiled to al dente perfection.  The noodles really made the dish, and their house XO sauce was amazingly good.  I'd easily return solely for this entree!  I've also had Pan Fried Noodles with their XO sauce on a previous visit, which was also very well done.  If you're up for jook (rice porridge), there's plenty of traditional Cantonese versions, like the jook with pork and 1000 year old eggs. It was homey and plentiful in serving size, but the rice was significantly over boiled for my preference.    I've been here on weekends for their dim sum, but was dissuaded by the 2 hour plus wait time.  The good news is that weekday wait times are much more palatable, and dim sum items are available for order until 3pm.  Their dim sum offerings lack in uniqueness, but are solid in authenticity.    For late night owls, or rather late night gambling owls, Ping Pang Pong is open until 3am.  There's nothing like closing out an evening in Las Vegas with something hearty and homey for \"sieu yeh\" (a late night snack).",

    "text": "The Food When eating your way across Las Vegas, one cannot forget the importance of dim sum. The place our friend recommended was Ping Pang Pong The Chinese Kitchen. We ordered quite a bit of dishes, some including... - Cha Siu Bao - Shrimp Rice Roll - Spare Ribs - Chinese Broccoli - Meatball - Beef Stew Claypot - Claypot Rice - Custard Pineapple Bun All the dishes were very good, and my friends and I enjoy them. Some we even got seconds like the Custard Pineapple Bun because everyone wanted more. The restaurant also had a dinner menu, which I would also like to try if I ever return.  The Miscellaneous The restaurant is very spacious, but people will line up before it opens. It gets crowded quite quick so it's recommended to get a reservation. The interior is very typical of an upscale Chinese Restaurant. The service was pretty face and the staff were professional. They had a wide selection on dim sum on carts, and some unique dishes that most dim sum places doesn't have. In the end, the prices were not super expensive per person, and everyone enjoy the experience. Would recommend to those looking for a good dim sum place to try in Las Vegas.",

If you can hold out a couple of minutes and drive a few blocks over to Spring Mountain... then do it!  This is not a destination place for Chinese food.  For what we paid, I thought it quite mediocre... Horrible even.  The standard dim sum was okay, but the certain things were just awful.  The fried calamari was just terrible.  It was super greasy as if the fry oil was extremely old and dirty.  There was also very little squid... mostly just puffy batter.  I was also excited to see a few pastry-type items that I have never seen before.  There was some kind of pineapple twist, and a red-bean filled bun.  Both were on the dry or old side, and marginal at best.  Service was ok, except for the boiling-hot water that was splashed on my back by one of the waiters.  Granted it was only a little, but seriously... really?  And without so much as stopping to apologize...  For two people we paid nearly $50.  Not really sure if the bill was even correct given that the classes of plates are not really advertised anywhere.  But its pretty much the most I've paid for dim sum.",

The food quality has diminished a bit from 4 stars to 3 stars.    When we were ordering the clams in black bean sauce the servers kind of didn't know what we were talking about.  Then after a few minutes they finally figured it out and then we found out that they didn't have any Manila clams but they had the razor ones.   We had 7 adults and 2 small children for dim sum and spent $200!  Wow, that was a little insane since it doesn't even seem like we ordered much.  Their prices per dish is a little higher than most places.  A lot of the dishes we got was also at the higher mark.  My mom said that we would have done better going to an AYCE sushi place for the same amount and had more variety.    Original review: My family loves coming here for their dim sum!  They renovated recently and the place just looks gorgeous!  Everything is nice and clean, fresh and inviting.  They did an excellent job!  Ladies man the carts but you can also try and order with a server as well.  The carts come around quite a bit so just be a little patient if you don't see what you wanted in the first round of ladies going by.    Some things we usually order: Steamed and baked pork buns Small spare ribs Beef tendon Honeycomb tripe Congee Shumai Beef balls Har gow crystal shrimp dumpling Calms in black bean sauce Egg tarts Turnip cakes  Shrimp in rice noodle with lots of sauce Fried taro balls Tofu pudding   Oh man, I'm getting hungry thinking of all that food!

    "text": "Came here today for the first time to try their dim sum. I typically don't eat a whole lot of dim sum because it's quite heavy on the oil. And even when I do have dim sum, I typically go to KJ Kitchen. However, some friends invited my husband and I to a Sunday brunch! I definitely took this chance to try it!   I got there at around 10:15 AM or 10:20 AM and there was no line. We snagged a table first while waiting for our friends to arrive. The service was quick, at first, to grab us water or tea, and plenty of people came to ask if we wanted to get something to eat. Surprisingly, they do push dim sum carts around. I was told by a friend previously that PPP was made to order ... I guess not? I was a little disappointed in this.   We got orders of shumai (pork dumpling), ha gow (shrimp dumpling), beef meat balls, beef wrapped in rice noodles, taro something, sticky rice, bbq pork buns, egg tarts, and Portuguese tarts.  The shumai were not good. They were tougher than any other shumai I had. Our friend said that they were probably previously frozen. Gross. The ha gow was honestly the only thing decent and worth having at PPP. The beef wrapped in rice noodles were average. The taro cake wasn't that great. They used dried shrimp in it and the flavor of the dried shrimp over took everything. That was all I tasted. The sticky rice only came with one and most dim sum places, they typically give you two. They also put a whole quail egg in? The bbq pork buns did not have enough meat in it according to my husband. The egg tarts were decent but they were full sized and I prefer the mini ones.   Overall, I would honestly rather go back to KJ Kitchen for dim sum. Don't get me wrong, PPP isn't bad. It just isn't all that special to me and definitely not the best of the batch. I also prefer to have good shumai over good ha gow. The hubby doesn't eat shrimp. Haha.   Also, there was a line by the time we left at 11:40 AMish. If you do want to try the dim sum here, try to get here early.",

The restaurant is located close to the parking structure so it's easy to find. Parking is free. The decor of this restaurant is beautiful. If you're wondering about the beads on the wall, they are abacus or Chinese calculator for you young ones out there.  Anyhow, they have a variety of dim sum from steamed dumplings to baked pastries.

If you are there for the food, it's great. If you are there to be wowed by Bellagio style service, you're obviously at the wrong place but it will work, no complaints from me.  I will definitely return to more during the week to escape the holiday rush. By far the most authentic and tasty place in Las Vegas. The price is on par with those other Dim Sum joints in town but much more tastier and popular. If you're down for a quick lunch, swing right in during non holiday hours! Clean, delicious, and fast: trifecta for great Chinese food!",

Can't believe it's almost a year since the first time I found out about this place through a friend. This time around, we made sure this was the first stop we made in LV to satisfy our huge appetite. Warning: get here early to avoid the long lines of people trying to get some shrimp balls.  As soon as the host directs you to your seat, be prepared to be asked if you're interested with plate after plate of dim sum & other Chinese concoctions. Items are not priced the same, obviously, so it's a guessing game how much they will charge you at the end of your meal (although they do stamp your order summary with some item/menu codes like in other dim sum places) but it really doesn't matter because the food is good any time of the day. Try the almond coated shrimp & shrimp balls on green bell pepper with black bean sauce with any of their special fried rice. The flavor lingers in your mouth like white on rice. Lol, rice coz I'm Asian. Lots of yummy things here & there; yummy things are everywhere! Order a glass of Thai iced tea or some hot tea to wash out the after taste. Sesame balls are always good to close out a filling meal. Got my full meal, & I was one satisfied customer.",

The restaurant is inside of the Gold Coast casino and there are no walls just wooden bars to desperate the restaurant which made it even louder, louder than average dim sum.

The service was very lazy and doesn't really listen to what you're trying to order, and my grandma is Chinese and fluently speaks Cantonese and Mandarin so the servers had no communication barrier. We ordered something off the menu not the carts and it took almost 25 minutes to come out even though it was just a small noodle dish.

We came here for dinner, in the mood for dim sum & were not disappointed.  Being dinner, the dim sum menu is limited, but still worth it.  The sesame shrimp rolls are crispy & coated with sesame seeds, filled with suculent shrimp.  The golden sand buns (steamed egg custard buns) are wonderful with a fresh bun & smooth sweet egg custard filling.  We also ordered some appetizers.  The pot stickers are crispy golden filled with a perfectly seasoned ground pork, cabbage, & ginger filling; perfect with a little rice vinigre drizzled over the top.  The vvegetarian egg rolls are crispy with a perfect vegetable filling; perfect with the well balanced sweet & sour sauce.  The pan fried seered shrimp & chive dumplings are wonderful with wonderful wrapper that is not doughy & perfectly pan fried bottom; the suculent & savery filling is excellent.  The hand made fried shrimp balls are wonderful with a crispy exterior & well seawsoned suculent interior.  For other desserts, not on the dim sum menu at nigyht, the sesame balls are sublime with a crispy sesame seed coated exterior & smooth red bean paste filling.  The service is friendly & attentive.  I can hardly wait to come back & try other items.  Round it off with a Ching Dao & you will not be disappointed.  Keep up the good work guys.",

Other places sell previously frozen dimsum and the giveaway is the texture of the shrimp. The food is pushed around in carts and piping hot.   My favorites are the shuimai, hargow, rice rolls (packed with lots of shrimp), chicken feet and egg tarts. They have some unusual fare too like escargot in wine sauce. Good selection and prices are comparable to California dimsum. Do not go anywhere else for dimsum in Vegas!

We asked about it after 10 minutes but the hosted told us we had to wait like everyone else. So all those who were a party of 1-4, ahead of us, were waiting for smaller tables that were all filled. So we waited patiently in the smoke filled casino. As we approached the front, there were two couples ahead of us and the host asked how many in your party? The both answered two and when she asked us we said, \"Seven.\" And she immediately waived us ahead of the two couples...After waiting 40 minutes they line jumped us? What? SMH!!! This is absurd!

The manageress then tried to bullshit me by saying that the particular item takes longer to cook because they needed to fry it first. She shut up when I called her out on it as I have owned a Chinese restaurant before and knew what goes into making sweet and sour pork. I would've rather she just say I'm sorry we fucked up, it's coming right up. Never try and make lame excuses to the customer.

Really good seasoning and sauce  Chinese broccoli, really crunchy and steamed to perfecftion  salt and pepper pork chops, so damn good!  PIang Pang Pong also offers Dim Sum we tried a couple entrees it was ok they had some stuff that werent on your typical dim sum menu i guess they added a few things since there are so many Chinese customers they had to be competitive.  I would highly recommend coming during lunch time the menu is cheap and you get your money's worth and it is pretty good overall.  Just expect it to be crowded and packed with a bunch of Asians.  If you are expecting to have a business meeting i would not recommend it this place is LOUD and I literally was screaming at my aunt in all our conversations.",

Ping Pang Pong Ping Pang Pong Ping Pang Pong Ping Pang Pong Ping Pang Pong...  See?  Don't even front.  You're grinning right now-- or at least cracking a smile too.  :P  So I just had to check it out.  Chicken Congee.  They make special!  (For you?)  Yes, for me.  Usually I don't care for runny, Cantonese style rice gruel.  Plain, thick, bright white porridge is what makes my palate happiest.  Chicken bits, soup colour and mystery stuff that I myself did not place in the cooked down rice, just weirds me out... sorry.  Blame it on my boring Taiwanese-Japanese influenced upbringing.  However.  What's the point of being in Vegas, if you don't take chances?  In this case, I gambled on trying it.  And it paid off.  In my tummy.  This congee item wasn't on the menu, but it was kind of them to cook it up.  The waitress suggested it.  Perhaps she took one look at my haggardness and thought I needed some.  It was quite good.  Wor Wonton Soup was also basic and tasty.  Will have to try the dim sum this place is known for, next time.  The soups here were a good way to wind down a full day of travel and eating on the run.

    "text": "I'm a fan of Dim Sum, and usually try to make it a point to try them when I come across one.  To this day, I have yet to find a place that blew my mind.  Din Tai Fung was probably the closest (is that even considered dim sum?), but in the more typical joints where they come around with the trays, I've never been super impressed.  We decided to try Ping Pang Pong since it was in a casino, and we figured it would provide the necessary cleanliness that I find to be generally lacking in dim sum spots.    We got there 15 minutes before they opened on Sunday, and there was a line of 3-4 parties waiting in front  of us.  By the time they opened, there were another 5-6 parties behind us.  Shortly after we began dining, the place was full.  Good sign.  The wait staff was surprisingly Chinese - I say that because this is inside the Gold Coast and I would have thought the wait staff would be more diverse - and resulted in a service very typical to other dim sum restaurants.  They spoke little English, and often called out the dish in Chinese even after realizing we were not Chinese.  The decor was clean and typically nice for a casino restaurant, so this part we enjoyed quite a bit - dim sum in a clean environment.  The food was actually quite good.  It was quite distinctly lacking of the dumplings and shumai that we were looking for, they just kept telling us it would come later and they would come in trickles.  But what did eventually come - shrimp shumai and shrimp & pork shumai - were very good.  But alas, no har gow, no rice noodle rolls with shrimp (they had one with beef...), and just not enough choices of these little pieces.  What they did have though, were interesting and not common.  Congee porridge is common, and theirs is good.  They have a large bowl for the table and a smaller bowl for one.  They had cooked congee in spice broth which were excellent, and clams in similar sauce that were great also.  Their souffle-type dessert (they only make 10 per day) was delicious, as well as the custard flavor rolls.  One big issue I had with them were that the dessert dishes started coming out first, and just kept coming around.  Why do they do that?  Bring out the porridge and dumplings first!  We kept having to tell them \"later, after we eat!\" as the dessert trays passed by probably at least half dozen times.  They've got to fix this.  But all-in-all a good meal, and our meal for 4 came to $49 plus tips.  That's not a bad deal, and perhaps I can overlook some of their glaring shortcomings.  3.5 stars is more appropriate, but I'll bump up a half based on the quality of what we actually did get to eat.  Table-for-1 Factor:  May be for regular lunch & dinner, but for the dim sum brunch it's probably not a great option.",

I cannot eat the food that they actually eat in Japan and China. When I am served chicken at a restaurant that is cold (on purpose), yellow, still has the skin on, and has chopped up bones in it, I don't even want to take a bite.Fried pieces of pork that still have the fat on them do not appeal to me. A soup that is served with a huge bone in it with tiny scraps of meat and fat clinging to it does not look appetizing. In the spirit of adventure, I ate a few bites of everything, and it wasn't disgusting or anything, just meh.  In fairness, Ping Pang Pong also has some of the traditional American-y dishes you can get at your local Chinese takeout, but we were looking to branch out and try some new things. I'm not upset with the restaurant - I'm sure this is excellent preparation of Princess Chicken or Salt & Pepper Porkchops - they just aren't for me.  We also tried the singapore noodles, which were kinda like your standard Lo Mein, and some fried rice, which I thought was really good. Our final order was the wrinkled green beans, and they were also good. Overall, we mostly stuck to the noodles and the rice.   Our 6 dishes and 2 drinks ran about $80, so it's higher than your average takeout place, but still reasonable. We had enough food to easily feed 4 people.  The atmosphere inside is nice - kind of like any casino restaurant between casual and fine dining. The drawback there is that it's open to the extremely smoky Gold Coast casino floor.",

The portions here are very big and fresh. Must try lamb chop and Cantonese roast duck; they have perfect seasoning. Walnut shrimp is my favorite; it's juicy and not too salty and the shrimp were super big with creamy sauce and crispy walnut.",

    "text": "Beware of unexpected overcharge when they total the bill (charging for special item when it was a small item on the original bill)!  First visit to this restaurant yesterday, here is my takes:  Pros: 1. Nice decor. 2. Dishes are \"on the average\" slightly better. Individual dishes can be better or worse than an average dim sum place.  3. The soy paper roll was more tasty than the one I used to have. 4. They do fill your teapot regularly.  Cons: 1. Accounting for quantity, price of most dishes are 50% to 100% more expensive than the regular dim sum place I go to.  So unless money is no subject to you, it may not be worth it.  2. Some dishes are not hot. The stuffed pepper I had was lukewarm, which made for a much lesser dining experience. I passed on the pot sticker for that reason, knowing it has been sitting on the cart as long as the stuffed pepper. Some dishes really do not taste the same when they are not hot. At this price level, one certainly expect more.  3. The Har Gow is 50% more expensive and not bigger nor better. My 7 years old label it as yucky and stop eating it after she had one! Why? She said the skin is soggy. Har Gow has been her favorite dish at our regular dim sum place and she usually finish 4 in a single setting, not this time.  4. The baked bbq pork bun taste sticky, and is small, though only 20% more expensive.  5. The waiter made no attempt to write down or understand what we want when we first sat down (we asked for 4 bowls, a pot of water and a pot of tea, plastic spoons and forks for the kids, the last three items were omitted by him) and came back with half of the items we wanted. We were left waiting, not knowing if he is going to come back with the other items, he never did.  6.. Last but not the least, the check! They overcharged me when they totaled the bill by charging Small dim sum(labelled as A)  as special dim sum (labelled as D), a difference of $3 per dish plus tax.  I do not know how that can be an honest mistake, A and D are not next to each other.  Is it intentional? That is certainly fruit for thought. Most customers do not check their bill and would never know.   I go to other dim sum restaurants frequently (at least once a week, sometimes 3 times) and never had any billing error (I am one of the rare few who check my bills regularly). Ping Pong Pang is one for one in the department of inflating the charge at the cash register. When it was pointed out to them and  they came back with the correct bill, there was no \"I am sorry for the error\". It certainly left a bad taste in my mouth. To make a billing mistake and not apologize for it certainly leaves a lot to be desired.",

    "text": "Whoa, second day in a row that I picked a place with a huge crowd and a wait.  I think I could've legitimately done without the wait. They have a sign pointing to a waiting area just outside of the restaurant, but they didn't seem to have a dedicated host. I stood there for at least 5 minutes before they even so much as said hi to the party in front of us, and another 5 before they seated us. It was very busy, but at least I should've been welcomed, and I'm pretty sure there were at least a couple of open tables.  By the way, try to park at the side of Gold Coast farthest from the Rio if you want to have a shorter walk, which is healthier than it sounds due to less secondhand smoke exposure.  Anyway, as with any good dim sum place, we were able to dive right in since the carts made their rounds quickly. My friend started off the picks with a har gow (4 pieces), a shu mai (4), and a rather large and unfamiliar bowl of some sort of tripe with ginger and daikon. I later got us a plate of shrimp stuffed eggplant pieces (3), some deep fried shrimp balls with sugar cane (2) and some nice compact egg tarts (2). The last item was the chicken feet that my friend was pining for the whole time.  Everything was definitely on the high end of good. All the savory items had sufficient flavor and non-mushiness, and the egg tarts were very flaky and were still noticeably warm at the end of the meal even though I'd ordered them at the start. I didn't fall in love with any one dish, but the quality was solid overall. Prices are probably a bit more than you'd expect since it's a casino restaurant and there's not all that many dim sum shops here. It was most likely $5.88 each for the tripe bowl and chicken feet, per my friend, and we had one $2.18 order, four $2.88 items, and one $3.88 dish. Couldn't tell you which is which since I'm not that much of a dim sum connoisseur, sorry!   Overall, I wasn't blown away by any single item, but it was solid dim sum and I definitely prefer this to East Ocean, which has seemed a little lacking for me the past couple of trips for some reason. I also definitely appreciated that we got a tangerine and candy here instead of a fortune cookie (looking at you, East Ocean). I have not been to KJ yet, so stay tuned in case I decide to hit them up.",

Getting in is the hard part-- you stand in line with a crowd of people yelling in various Chinese dialects as they shove, cut, and complain-- all adding authenticity and closely matching my experiences in China.  Another reason for the long wait is, once inside, diners tend to linger. I don't blame them. The food is tasty, hot, and well-varied. All my favorite dim sum dishes were here.  Servers are friendly and I never felt ignored (as I have at other dim sum places).  For about $18 including tip I was able to stuff myself.    The 40 minute wait to get in was painful but I'm glad I stuck around.",

On top of that the server never says for ex: \"Hi I'm Ben\" instead they just come and say are you ready to order or you have to say excuse me to whoever is walking by.  For that I give this place 3 stars because the service should match the beautiful restaurant.  Sometimes the staff is rude and barely acknowledge you, well most of the times. If the staff were more friendlier and more aware that different cultures are there to enhance their tastings with good Chinese Food, then I would give it 5-Stars.  I will admit the food is 5-Stars.

I have been here a few times and went there again today for some dim sum. Every single time we eat here there is always a long waiting line to just get seated. The food is average for a dim sum place. The only reason I go here is because I have comps to use up before they expire. After waiting about 15-30 minutes to be seated, we wait again for about 10 minutes before a waiter/waitress even shows up to take our drink order. Almost every time we sit at the table we are missing either silverware or tea cups. This place is always understaffed and could use more personnel to wait on the customers. The food is about average and once something runs out from the dim sum carts it takes over 30+ minutes to replenish that food item. This restaurant could definitely use a lot more improvements to service, training, and wait times.",

But when I'm handed a 16 dollar check for three small pork buns, two teas and two plates of small potstickers I gasp.  Because in Chinatown, heck, in any Dim Sum place I've been to in the last five years, that is outlandishly priced.  But hey, maybe all Dim Sum makers decided to up the price all at once and no one told me. Maybe it's just Nevada. No? Just triple P?  Good to know.  The service was good for cart Dim Sum, but again, we didn't revisit during our trip due to the price.  If we return we'll most likely skip it. I'd rather head to TGIF and get a huge place of food for less than that.",

We sat at a round  table, it appears they have some tables with Lazy Susan's which makes it easier for sharing. The reason I gave this establishment such a low rating was because the service was very bad and the food wasn't anything to rave about. We tried several dishes and none were impressive. The waitress kept trying to rush us out the door. It took them approximately 30 minutes to take out order. We received watered down Thai teas which had to be sent back, as well as one meal in a box without requesting so and the check was also presented halfway through the meal when we clearly weren't finished. The food was good but There are better Chinese restaurants in town. Sadly don't think I'll be back.",

We were both craving dim sum at midnight, so what better place to be, since it closed at 3am?!  I honestly didn't know how legit the dim sum would be so I ordered Mongolian Beef and a cup of rice. I didn't think the portions would be that big, but when I got my beef and looked around the room, I noticed plenty of families eating together... hmm.. FAMILY SIZED PORTIONS! Even better!  I wanted to try a couple of the Dim Sum items, so I ordered the Baked Pork Bun, and HALLELUJAH! This right here, BAKED PORK BUN, is the BIDNIZZZ (business). If you want to try one thing, please let this be it!   A couple weeks later, I told my friend about my dim sum craving and recommended this place. This time we were actually here for the dim sum. We ordered every single thing off the dim sum menu. Don't worry, there were about 10 or less items all $3 each.  After getting to taste them all, MY TUMMY WAS HAPPY.   It was then time for dessert, but the server did not notice... We waited and waited, and stared into the sky, hoping they would acknowledge us. & they finally did! 30 minutes later... Thank goodness the egg custard dessert was BOMB.ORG, because it slightly made up for the time lost!  PING PANG PONG!  TRY THE BAKED PORK BUN!",

My friends arrived before me so we didn't have to wait in line. There was a small line already. We arrived right when they opened at 10 a.m. The restaurant is the smallest one I've seen from the other dim sum places I've been to in this town.  The server took our drink orders right away. The dim sum ladies came by with their carts. We picked a few items. Some of the carts can be a little slow because a few times, we were waiting to eat more. The service is the least friendliest compared to the other dim sum places in town. Nothing too friendly or too abrasive...just your typical, nonchalant Asian service.   Moving on to the food...It was fresh, good, and hot. Shumai, shrimp har gow, fried shrimp ball with mayo dip, shrimp in rice noodle, shrimp in bean curd, egg custard tart, & the donut resembling a malasada with red bean were delicious!   The only thing that bugged me...We asked for hot sauce twice but never got our hot sauce. It's not a deal breaker but I like my foods with a little kick. Whatever, no biggie. I'll be back and I will make sure I get my damn hot sauce!",

In Las Vegas I asked the sushi chef (no he wasn't Japanese) in the Fulton Street Food Hall in Harrahs if he knew where local Las Vegans went for dim sum. He explained that while he was new to the area having recently relocated from LA he recommended the spot over in the Gold Coast. That spot is Ping Pang Pong.  Sadly I got there a little late and yes there was a wait so the dim sum offerings were scant. I was told that they have dim sum all day, but by 3 there were only 5 items left. I was there with two dim sum neophytes. In the light of all of my enthusiasm they found the offerings underwhelming and ordered off of the regular menu. The spare ribs were some of the best I've ever had. In fact we got two orders. The sesame seed balls were different from the ones I've had on the East Coast but I liked them. In fact, the remaining two items I ordered were different but not bad. I'm giving this restaurant a 3 because I believe I wouldn't have been underwhelmed if I'd had more to choose from. The service was sub par though, we had to wait quite a while for refills on water and tea and the extra napkins we requested but the place was packed. That said, I really need to visit again to render a fair review. It's worth a 2nd visit for sure.",

She brought a menu and asked for my drink order. Didn't come back for more than 10 minutes and only wanted to deliver my water. I told her I was ready to order. She seemed annoyed but took my order. Kung Pao chicken and Night Fried Rice. A few minutes later another woman came to deliver good, that i did not order. I dont know if she didnt speak english, but, i told her no. Not mine. She said yes, yes and stared at me. Finally when i handed it back to her she got the idea. It was for tbe ladt next to me. Very unfriendly and almost rude staff. Food came quickly and it was hot and fresh. Never saw the waitress again. I was finally refilled on my water by a manager of some sort who was very nice.

I have lived in many cities and travelled overseas and I can safely say this is easily the top 3 best dimsum I have ever had.  It is better than LA/SF, BC, NYC; in fact, it is better than the dim sum I had in Hong Kong.   1) They still use the authentic push carts. 2) It is easy to over season and over salt the food like so many restaurants.  But not at PPP.  It is so refreshing to be delicate and controlled in seasoning.  I don't remember the last time I ate such balanced and light dim sum.  Don't believe me?  try to cook a delicious dish with as little seasoning as possible.  It is difficult.  Somehow PPP managed to do just that.  All the ingredients shine through in an airy melody.    3) They also have dishes that normally don't show up in other dim sum restaurants. 4) I especially recommend their bbq pork buns and steamed honeycomb tripe.  Shut your eyes and enjoy the texture, subtle flavors and the balance of the whole dish.   5) try their mango dessert -- real mango pieces and clearly made with real mangos.  Well done, PPP.",

Customer service was decent, but it took wayyyy over 30-40 minutes just to get our food...total cost of food cost us over $116 bux...we didn't care anymore...we were hungry. \"$3.88 for 4 pieces of siu-mai? Aww damn, but fu*k it...we got a group to feed,\" says my bro lol...  While we waited, they served us ice water which was nice, and since we were drunk off the alky and were hella hungry, we ordered wor wonton soup...it was hella bomb haha  Eventually we got our food and ate it back at the hotel... -Fried Rice: 2 kinds I forget what...simple but good -Salt 'n' Pepper Pork Chop-a tad bit salty but it was good -Pork siu-mai-expensive but it was delish -Wor Wonton-the second time around, the broth was hella salty -Honey walnut shrimp--delish -HK style chow mein--I can't believe they ruined my fave dish...hella corn-starchy...and no flavor!! :/  Nonetheless though, we were satiated and sleepy by 3am haha",

Service wasn't spot on as it took a bit of time to get seated even when at this early time not all the tables were filled. Also took some time to get the attention of the service staff to get orders in. In the end the standout here is the dim sum. A large variety of various dim sum platters. Some you'll only find as specialty items in Asia and not found in the states. Large portions as well for a dimsum plate so you get value for your buck. Nicely flavored shrimp dumplings and chinese meatballs. They had a great tofu dessert. Served hot in a bowl with sugar syrup. Delicious shrimp and beef churn fun. Freshly baked egg tarts that were still hot and flakey. Their beef chow fun was also very good with lots of ingredients and can serve a large group. If in Vegas and hankering for some dim sum i would definitely come here. Would be 4 stars on food alone if not for the service.",

From the hagow to the shumai , everything was tasty and fresh, my only qualms is that the Lo-Mai-Kai only came with one! there's usually 2-3 :( Lo-Mai-Kai is the stuffed rice wrapped inside the leaf and my favorite thing to get!   other than that it was great, price is a little on the expensive side since it is in a hotel 2.88 for (A) and 3.88 for (B)  would come again",

LOVE their dim sum, it's all I've ever had there so I can not comment on their Chinese Food.  I can tell you though that 98% of their customers are Asian and so that is a huge indicator of the level of authenticity.  In the past we had trouble communicating with the staff because they usually speak in their own language, this last time though it seems they have hired more English speaking staff and it was considerably easier to order.  Everyone is smiley and happy, the worst part is getting seated.  There is ALWAYS  a wait, I don't care what time or day you go, but once you get seated being it's dim sum there is no wait for food and it just keeps rolling past you for your pleasure.  I love everything we have ever had there and they are reasonable with their cost.  The worst part of this place is that it is located in the Gold Coast and you have to wade through the heavily smoked environment to get to the restaurant, but even going through that is worth it for this place.",

Highlights that I can remember: The BBQ buns (steamed and baked) were good! Steamed spareribs were good, a tab bit too spicy for me. Steamed rice wrapped in green leaves - YUM! Rice soup with shredded pork and preserved egg - YUM YUM! Almond tofu dessert - 1 Yum and a Yeah!",

It was probably a little less expensive, but the flavors didn't pop quite as much, the quality shine the same way, and the service wasn't very attentive.   I had hot tea and they didn't have honey only sweet and low, kinda odd. We ordered some dim sum, a Shrimp noodle dish my guest picked out, and Chilean Sea Bass with some sort of fried glaze around it, which made an already oily fish very greasy. Don't get me wrong, the cuisine wasn't terrible, but I guess I'm just recently spoiled from DTF.   Sorry, didn't take pictures. It was a business dinner and I felt weird about snapping pics throughout the meal. I'm such a bad, bad, bad Yelper! Nothing noteworthy missed though.",

Depending on the time you come, right when they open or closer to when they close around 3pm, will dictate what dim sum items are available. For sure if you go early,  the staple favorites are usually available, except for the shrimp rice sheets. And towards the end of the dim sum service, tripe and rice porridge is no longer available.    We arrived at 130pm and we waited in line for about 30 min. I'd say there were 3 food carts max that were rotating around the entire restaurant. The shu mai was the bomb, they may be tiny but they pack a ton of flavor especially from the shittake mushrooms! We ended up ordering two of those hehe.   They ran out of the typical shrimp rice sheets, fortunately they had dried shrimp/scallion rice sheets which surprisingly were super flavorful and tasty! The flavor of the shrimp and scallions pair really well together and has made it become one of my favorite dishes!  The bbq pork buns are also delicious here. The sweetness of the pork meat and the fluffiness of the bun is just perfect. I love the fact that the pork filling is not too sweet and the pork is not fatty at all. And they don't skimp on the amount of filling either...  The har gow was ok, not impressive by any means. We also tried shrimp tofu...it was ok, if you enjoy soggy tofu hehe. At least they give you a big piece of shrimp on top of it. I also wished they hadn't run out of the tripe or rice porridge. But oh well. The egg tarts on the other hand, were really flaky, light, and not too sweet either. Perfect dessert to end our meal.    For two people the bill came out to be 28 bucks, not bad at all especially for Vegas. Service wasn't good...but when is dim sum service ever good? We had to literally go up to the cashier to pay cuz nobody would take our bill hehe.",

Family style serving and plenty of carts bustling around. We ordered fried rice for the table and then went on a frenzy everytime a cart came by. They had everything we wanted. The har gow, siu mai and char siu bao were so good and satisfying. The beef cheong fun was pretty basic, I've had better. The jiu cai bau though was amazing!! We actually got multiple plates of it because it was so good. For dessert we had the egg tarts, which were also great. And fresh! They were still warm and the crust was so flaky and just the right amount of sweet. If I wasnt already so full from everything else, i would have taken the whole cart.  Service was great, fast and friendly. If one cart didnt have something we wanted, they would quickly flag down another to come to our table and were ever so patient with us deciding and looking at what we wanted.  Super reasonable price, I was shocked at how cheap it was for how much my friends and I ate. Would definitely come by again!",

The only thing that bothers me about this place is the cigarette smell that diffuses into the restaurant from the slot machine area.

Some of the memorable menu items included the fried chive cakes (I would be happy if my meal consisted entirely of this) and the lobster & vermacelli dish.  It can get a little busy during meal times, so if you want to avoid waiting in line, it is best to avoid popular eating times. We tried to go pretty early, so waiting in line wasn't too much of a problem.   It is located in Gold Coast, so it is not as easy to access as some other places directly on the main part of the Strip. However, it is definitely worth going out of your way if you want to experience Chinese foods during your trip to Vegas.",

My dinner, the orange beef, was good.  Not great, but good.  Everyone else liked their meals as well -- two different fried rice dishes and also Mongolian beef.  The service had a couple of hiccups -- one order came out wrong, which they did offer to fix.  Also, we never received any rice for either of the beef entrees.  I think the real charm of this place may come from the Dim Sum lunch menu or maybe the more \"authentic\" dishes.  But for those of us with Americanized taste buds, Ping Pang Pong is A-OK.",

    "text": "There are so many good reviews of this place on Yelp that I'm left wondering whether we hit them on a bad day.   We made a special trip from the Strip, arriving at 11h00 on a Friday morning. About half the tables were occupied. We were seated immediately. No trouble with the service - drinks and the carts arrived quickly. We selected the sticky rice, shrimp pastry, bbq pork bun, pork siu mai and the shrimp har gow. The sticky rice was acceptable, and I did enjoy the shrimp pastry. The other items were not to my liking.  It seemed that the ingredients were of poor quality, as opposed to the skill of the chef in preparing them.  We have enjoyed dim sum in many different cities and countries, as we try to make a point of having it at least once per trip. On this same trip we went to Noodles in Bellagio; while it was twice as much (almost to the penny), we enjoyed it much more than Ping Pang Pong.   It is unlikely that we would return, because it's not worth the hike from the strip for this level of quality.",

However, in a city where the life line of the place is based on serving others, this place might reconsider the way they serve people because it comes off as aloofness and can discourage potential customers to come back. The food, specially, dim sum, is really good. That is  what this place is known for. At $3.00 dollars an order, it is really affordable. There are also very good appetizers like sesame seed covered roll.  The rest of the venue is quite expansive, I will come back, making sure that I come back with the notion that the food is good enough that I am willing to ignore the service.",

However, we stopped going because the food started to make our bellies feel a little unhappy. We could never identify why exactly, but we decided to relocate our late night Chinese adventures to Spring Mountain Road. However, last night, we happened to be booking up Flamingo and decided to give it another chance because for several months straight I had a serious Wrinkled Green Bean addiction, and I wanted to go back for another round.  I knew immediately I would be ordering the Wrinkled Green Beans with some extra wrinkles, and I also ordered some basic chicken soft noodles. The service was a little slow, but friendly. Our waiter smiled when I told him I liked them \"really wrinkly.\" My husband ordered a noodle soup.  The green beans had a nice flavor, but they were pretty greasy and some of the magic flavor (described as a Chinese tarragon) was missing. The noodles were brown from soy sauce, which isn't my preference. Plus, the noodles lacked the amount of veggies that you often get in a noodle dish. A few slivers of cabbage, some hidden bean sprouts, but no carrots. And, the noodles were a bit chewy. The noodles were no comparison to the same dish at Noodle Exchange just across the way. Everything just seemed a tad too heavy, and my husband wasn't in love with his soup. He said, \"It wasn't bad.\"  I may be willing to go back for dim sum, as I have yet to try that, but for other times, I am afraid last night reminded me why we had stopped visiting.",

I can't quite describe it...all I know is that my hubby and I both agree we haven't found ONE single place in H-town that encompasses all the delectables that we ohhhh so love at P3!! (just made that up by the way) LOL  You know the feeling when you go to one dim sum restaurant and you really like one dish or two and but don't care for some others...it switches up everywhere you go..but not at P3! We love their shrimp dishes (can't name them all), pork shiu mai dishes, sticky rice in oh so yummy banana leaf, clam dish, their crab balls, I can go on and on... Overall-99% of the dishes we normally order --are all A+ here!  I know...you're thinking B.S!   Seriously folks, if you have that dim sum craving and you are in Sin City and got to get your Asian groove on....then swing by Gold Coast Casino because that is where you will find the yum yum!! You know it's authetic when all asians work and eat there...right?!! Just saying........  ps. Be prepared to wait in long lines at all hours of the day...YES, I mean all hours while dim sum is being served....service is kinda slow..I just don't get why the place is soo freaking pack and  the Mgr/Owner/Mr. Gold Coast/ whomever not realize that getting more service helpers would do them some good??? If there is good food, Asian people will wait, my hubby and I included!! You know how we are.... just push those carts around pleassssse! ;-)",

The dimsum was pretty decent and we ordered other dishes such as fried rice (for those that weren't accustomed to some dimsum items), kung pao chicken, beef chow fun....etc.  The dishes weren't too bad, but some were on the salty side.  The most difficult part of dining here would probably be the service.  Sure, the carts came and went as expected.  But near the end of the meal, we just wanted that dang egg tart cart to swing by.

That may be because it's in the Gold Coast and this place was nicknamed the Pan Pacific by my friend.  It was literally an Asian invasion.    So, when you see that all the peeps in a Chinese restaurant are Asian, that's gotta be a good sign, right?    The food was good, great even.  The prices were extremely reasonable for large, family style dishes.  We tried the usual offerings, including a spicy fried rice that had some serious kick.  Loved it.  The salt and pepper pork chops were delicious, but didn't have a ton of meat on them.    Minus one star for the wait.  Service wasn't great, but remember the saying...the worse the service, the better the food.  That always applies to Chinese food, so if you know this, you get it.",

    "text": "I had some time in between appointments and needed lunch.  Since I was alone and without my husband, who usually says \"no asian food,\" I came here for Dim Sum.  When I used to work at Boeing I used to go to Top Gun in Bellevue and Imperial Garden in Renton a bit for Dim Sum and loved it, so I'm comparing this to those establishments.  I had one order of Shumai, one Shrimp Dumpling, one steamed  Pork Bun, and after I was full they had fried crab claws that I couldn't say no to.  I felt like I ate way too much food, even though the plates were tiny.  The Shumai was ok, it has nothing on Top Gun's Shumai which is my favorite ever.  The shrimp dumplings at Imperial Garden are also superior but these were good.  The real star of my meal here was those crab claws, though.  I really loved those which is why I feel Ping Pang Pong gets four stars.  So my husband, who isn't a real dim sum fan outside of baked pork buns, or a fan of Asian food in general because he never had it in his native alien territory of Montana, found out I went here and now wants to go, so I'm happy to say I will drag him here soon and get some of those crab claws again.",

We were pleasantly surprised that it was an authentic dim sum restaruant - and inside a casino no less!  The dim sum was not the best we've ever had, but it was above average; certainly better than other places we had tried in Vegas up to that point.  Price was reasonable, and we knew we would be back.  Gave it 4 stars.  UPDATE:  We returned on 2011-04-16 for dim sum lunch.  Food was still reasonably good, but it seems to have lost a bit in the quality.  They were out of some items we wanted such as har gow (we got there a bit late), and the food overall seemed to lack some seasoning; some of the sauces seemed watered down.  We'll keep coming back to this place for dim sum until we find something better in Vegas, but have lowered the rating to 3 stars.  See my other reviews of other places in Vegas.",

Later, we paid and I tried to give the girl at the front desk (where the cash registers were) and she literally didn't want to help me.

    "text": "I've eaten at Ping Pang Pong twice now and had two very different meals with two very different outcomes. My first experience with PPP was for Dim Sum. It was absolutely delicious and very authentic. I've been eating at some of the great Dim Sum houses in Alhambra (East of Downtown LA) and surrounds for years and years and was quite surprised and pleased that PPP was able to serve up Dim Sum that was on par with some of the greats like Ocean Star and NBC (Both on Atlantic Blvd. Alhambra...Don't miss 'em).   Ping Pang Pong serves a wide variety of Dim Sum and the carts filled with the steaming treats are plentiful. The prices are similar to places in Alhambra & Los Angeles, however, instead of placing four of something on a plate, they put three. Nonetheless, the food is terrific. Lunch for three very satisfied people was about $10-$12 per person...and we were stuffed. Bravo on Dim Sum PPP.  Now the downside to the story...  My second trip to the restaurant was for dinner. We ordered Hot & Sour Soup, Pineapple Beef, Seafood Noodles, and Squab in Lettuce Cups. Overall a great disappointment.   The Hot & Sour soup was the best dish we ordered, so we started off the meal well. The Squab in Lettuce Cups were good, but not great...and a bit on the chintzy side. Because there were four of us, we were required to order two additional pieces of lettuce at $1 apiece. Come on...two extra dollars for two tiny pieces of lettuce? The Pineapple Beef had absolutely NO FLAVOR. It was terrible actually. I don't even think they put salt in it it was that tasteless. The pineapple chunks were straight out of a can...and the can was probably from the 99 Cent store. Just plain bad. The Noodles were about average from any Chinese restaurant.   Towards the end of the meal I felt like I would only come back to this place for Dim Sum but some of my dinner companions disagreed. We did see dishes that looked really savory and tempting being served to other tables. The Walnut Glazed Shrimp looked amazing!    The overall consensus was that we may have just ordered a couple of dishes that were lackluster and that Ping Pang Pong is worthy of another dinner experience. Their Dim Sum is first rate so I know they know how to cook.",

We were also almost as far from the kitchen as you can get (the left side), and on our way out we saw that the other side of the restaurant got way many more dishes than we were offered.  My favorites were the Chow Mein, BBQ Pork puffs and sesame balls with Red Bean paste in them. Other than those things, I could have gone without. The cart ladies don't speak much English, so you might end up with an accidental (or intentional) order of Chicken Feet as well.  I usually love the boneless ribs (those red ones or the honey glazed ones) at Dim Sum places, but they didn't have them here. I though I might have missed them on the cart, but the waitress confirmed.  Due to the variety of food, the temperature of the food by the time it reached us, and just how it tasted in general, I wouldn't come back here. The prices were good though and unlike many other Dim Sum places, our waitress was very attentive to our drink refill needs.",

They have plenty to choose from. One of those dishes is steam Chinese broccoli with schzuan sauce, so delicious. You don't have to be a vegetarian to enjoy that wonderful dish. Their brunch is also the bomb. They serve dim sum and most dishes are freshly served from the food cart. What I like a bout dim sum is that I don't have to over eat and still be satisfied with 2-3 small plates. Plus their hot tofu with syrup is a must order for dessert.

There were 6-10 groups in front of us on a Saturday and we were seated within 20 minutes.   The servers will direct you to the more bland and gringo-safe food if you're not Chinese so make sure you ask them about the things they don't offer that are on their carts and pay attention to the items that the regulars all select and you'll be happy. We got a spicy snail dish only because we saw it and asked about it. It was nice if you're okay with chewy snails, but it being on our table also encouraged some servers to offer us stuff on their second pass that wasn't offered the first time round.   It was pretty cheap based on my experiences in LA. We had enough food for three people to stuff themselves silly and paid about $60. We'll be back for at least a few more visits before moving on to the next place for dim sum in town.",

After some deliberation, we decided to check this place out. A number of Chinese employees and clientele encouraged us, so we got a table and waited for the carts. Surprisingly, for dim sum in a Vegas casino, pretty good! We have done NBC in Monterey Park and hold that as the standard. If NBC is a 10, this is an 8.5. Char Siu Bao were tasty but small, the dumplings were very good, as were the shu mai. If you need a dim sum fix near the strip, check it out. Oh and the price is very fair, $23 for two of us and we were stuffed.",

    "text": "In town for the '13 WSOP event 18, Ping Pang Pong has been a must-stop-by place the last 3 visits for their dim sum. Out of our large group of friends, 3 newbies and 4 vets of dim sum tagged along.  We stuck with the basics for the sake of the folks new to dim sum but their selection really isn't that big to begin with. They have all of the typical items and they do most of them well.  Steamed pork dumplings (shui mai) were very good. They were bigger than average, lots of pork goodness and hints of chopped mushrooms. The pork bulges out of the wonton wrapping like they were on 'roids.  Steamed shrimp dumplings (har gow) were good. The translucency made the newbies stare at it for a bit but the shrimp was fresh and there was an average amount.  Steamed BBQ pork buns (char siu bao) were average. Rather typical and on the small side but the filling was tasty. The baked versions were very good and the bread almost melts in your mouth. The thin egg wash layer on the top makes it a little sticky but it probably keeps it soft instead of crusty. Both fillings were just sweet enough without overpowering the pieces of pork.  Chow mein came in a big heap. The onions and green onions gives it a decent flavor but it didn't have the crispy, wok/pan fried edges it should have. It went well with the steamed pork ribs.  Speaking of pork ribs, they were also given a double take by the newbies as they look more like sedimentary rock than meat. They were fine but lacked the bit of black bean sauce it usually has. There was also only a few pieces in the dish but some of them were pretty meaty. Careful of the small bones as they are cut from the rib tip ends.  The steamed shrimp rice noodles (har cheung fun) were great as the shrimp again is fresh and there were plenty of them in each piece; 3 to an order. The noodle was slick and not chewy. They are drowned a bit in a light soy sauce. The beef version wasn't as great and had little seasoning but that's probably due to being steamed.  The deep-fried glutenous rice dumpling (hom sui gok) were good. Crispy yet light on the outside, the filling was a bit small but the pork, shrimp, and mushrooms were tasty.  I think I'm missing an item or two but dessert came as the sticky buns (gai mei bao) and were very good. The bread was nice and soft and the coconut and custard filling wasn't too sweet. This was a big hit at the table.  No one wanted to try the stuffed eggplants but in previous visits they were very good - not overcooked limpy and the filling of shrimp was crispy. No sight of chinese broccoli (gai lan) this time but in previous visits the dish was small and the broccoli was on the small side themselves. Didn't get any crispy spring rolls but there were average with a shrimp and pork filling. Other items I never tried are the different rice porridge, jelly fish, bbq pork and cummin filled pastries, and chicken feet.  It was a Monday morning around 11, an hour after they had opened, and it was about 60% full. The water refills were pretty steady and the carts that deliver the dim sum were coming and going at a good rate. It's at the far end of the casino floor and open to a bunch of slot machines on one side. My Sprint phone struggled to get a decent signal there.  Our bill came out to about $15 per person including tip, which is pretty typical price.  From their usual menu (and previous visits), the wor wonton soup is decent with lots of it in an order. The pot stickers were nicely pan fried, a bit doughy and the filling was okay. The grilled lamb chops were ok but they were mostly bone. The beef flat rice noodles were a bit greasy but tasty. However it didn't have a lot of beef in it.",

(I forgot to take pictures because we were so hungry that we just dug into the food right away.) It didn't taste fresh, and the dumpling skin wasn't very soft. The sui mai looked OLD. I eat dim sum quite frequently and this was nowhere near the standards for dim sum in LA!   The best thing was probably the boiled Chinese broccoli dish (which tastes the same everywhere) and cha siu bao (but I've still had better). Gr.. Eating such horrible dim sum just made me crave better Chinese food in LA.   Service: It was difficult to find a server to refill our drinks and give us our check. However, the workers are friendly and   Note: It's located inside Gold Coast Casino. Some advice? Come early!

Then came the pile of chicken with zero flavor and the presentation was just unappetizing. Then we switched it out for a simple orange chicken and pot stickers. How could they mess that up?  Wellll. Back went the whole table of food!  I've never sent a whole table of food back before this. We did eat some sort of beef dish that was only ok. Bottom line, there are soooo many places in Vegas to to eat Chinese and don't spend your money on this pitiful excuse for a restaurant. Yuck!",

    "text": "Items Selected: Crispy Duck with Roasted Peanuts Pork Belly with Roasted Peanuts Shrimp Ball with Mayo Chive Dumpling Almond Coated Shrimp with Mayo Steamed Pork Bun Har Gow Shumai Baked Pork Bun Baked Coconut Bun Egg Custard Stuffed Eggplant Pan Fried Red Bean Cake Red Bean Donut Red Bean Bun  Found inside the Gold Coast Casino, and said by some to offer the best Dim Sum in a City oft lamented for lacking anything on par with other locations of similar size, it was with three friends that an 11:00am arrival was planned at Ping Pang Pong - one showing up far later than the rest, but really not missing much as the majority of items proved mediocre to decent at best, though service was admittedly far superior to several spots on Spring Mountain Road...perhaps to be expected considering the price.  Served in traditional cart format, the table provided cattycorner the kitchen giving a good vantage of carts being loaded with fresh items throughout the duration of a two-hour stay, Ping Pang Pong features most of the usual suspects with minimal variation and taking a slow-but-prudent approach to ordering as the restaurant sat almost universally full it was with teas both iced and hot that service began, a duo of crispy duck and supple pork each served with peanuts and complimentary sauces proving well roasted and full of flavor, though the former was riddled with bones that left some pieces virtually devoid of meat.  Passing on snails that later went half-uneaten by the tardy member of the party, course two featured fried shrimp balls with a sidecar of creamy mayo along with surprisingly delicate and aromatic chive dumplings that rivaled the best found anywhere in town, and moving onward to a trio of plump crustaceans covered in sliced almonds it was here that the savory highpoints of the afternoon were found, the freshness of each item assured by the good fortune of location though the increasing smell of cooking oil and gas would eventually render that impression unsound.  Underwhelmed by both shumai and har gow with skins that trended too thick, and personally finding both styles of pork buns almost 'dessert like' given the significant amount of sugar present in the sauce, it was a bit of a surprise that the lightly set egg custards were almost entirely natural in flavor atop flaky buttered pastry, a duo of coconut buns ordered as the first of several sweets equally impressive without the gloppy filling that sometimes ruins the texture of the bun.  Adding one more savory, the soft eggplant with an herbal stuffing coated in fermented bean sauce, before going all-in on a trio of sweets to finish, suffice it to say that those fancying red bean paste are well served at Ping Pang Pong, and although items featuring both green tea, pineapple, and sesame were offered the pan fried cakes of red bean as well as baked buns and filled with the same were every bit as good as any tasted anywhere to date, the lack of pressure to turn a table while drinks were repeatedly refilled without request allowing time to linger, chat, and enjoy - an admitted rarity in during peak hours at restaurants serving in this style.  Charging approximately 25% more than other similar spots in town, and failing to nail the standards despite executing a few items quite well, Ping Pang Pong is just another average Dim-Sum joint intended to cater to the growing Asian tourist population, a better option for those confined to casinos found at nearby KJ in the Rio while those with a car would be well served to check out Chang's just a mile and a half to the North.",

Our green beans arrived, but some 10 minutes later we were still waiting for the noodles.

Having eaten dim sum at several Chinese joints in the SF bay area, I was somewhat disappointed in this place. But I do agree with some of the other reviewers that this is probably one of the better places for dim sum in all of Vegas.  They have all the usual favorites: har gow, shiu mai, spareribs, hom gok, taro puffs, sesame balls, egg tarts, gai lan, etc. We ordered a couple items (noodles and veggies) off the non-dim sum menu (limited items) but  found them to kind of pricey for what they were.  They definitely need more staff as there were often 2-3 carts just sitting in a corner of the restaurant full of fresh plates going cold. Meanwhile, patrons were  looking impatiently all around for the next cart to come around.  Total price for about 7-8 small plates plus noodles/veggies came to about $55 w/o tip for 4 people. Pretty standard.",

We first got in for dim sum and had one or two carts serve us then it was like we were infected people because no one would serve us. It took us about half an hour to get water and when we asked them to leave a pitcher of water so we wouldn't have to bother asking for refills, the waitress brought us 3 more glasses.  So we had plenty of water. We did however see a lot of dim sum carts pass us, but they seemed to be going to every other table but ours. You would think a table of 12 people would be easier to spot. Especially with half of use waving for service. We still are waiting as I am typing this. But I can take comfort in knowing that I will never go thirsty coming to Ping Pang Pong. Hungry maybe but never thirsty. Full of water sitting here looking at all the water glasses. I would love to give them 5 stars if I were rating their water service but cannot give them any stars based on their overall service. They get one only because Yelp will not let me post this with no stars.",

You can order off the menu or eat Dim Sum off the various food carts being rolled around the restaurant.  Personally, I think it's better to skip the menu and order whatever looks good on the carts.  We ordered all kinds of items off the carts with beer and our bill was only $50.  Everything was delicious, except the fried chicken feet, which even our waitress said she did not eat.  You don't want the chicken feet, but everything else we had off the carts was delicious.  Be prepared to be a little overwhelmed when you first sit down by the various food cart servers pitching you with all kinds of different food choices.  Just choose whatever looks good and pass on anything that doesn't, and stop ordering when your table looks like it has enough food on it.

A heard of people came out of nowhere and after we were already standing behind a person, which I was there before they got there.  I still waited behind.  After the person had his order taken the cashier rudely had said she would not take our order that we had to wait behind the long line of people.  And I told her you seen me I was here before all these people even showed up.  Wow I bet if I was an older couple I bet she would have took our order anyway.   That is just poor customer service and lacking hospitality.  I will make sure I let everyone and anyone know that these people or at least the cashier who opened up the shift today on a Sunday evening is more of a reason for a food aficionado like me be pissed enough to bring my business and loyalty else where.

We were in the mood for some dim sum, and since I heard this place was comparable to Orchids Garden, we decided to try this place out.  The restaurant wasn't even half full when we got our table, and yet this place still lacked service. The carts came by slowly and there was barely a selection of dim sum. We ordered a few items and the dim sum was cold. It must have been sitting out for awhile, and there wasn't any new dim sum coming out. Also, it took them FOREVER to bring us the water and tea. Since we weren't getting full off of dim sum, we decided to order some food off the menu (fried rice, noodles, and string beans), though it did take us a long time to order since nobody came by our table. When we got our noodles, they were very oily. The rice and string beans was mediocre, nothing to rave about. When we got our bill, we were surprised at the total. We weren't even full and yet we ended up paying a lot. Plus, they charge for tea. WTF! I have been eating dim sum all my life, and all of the places (Portland, Seattle, Vanc BC) I have been do not charge for tea. That is BS.   Overall, I will NOT come back here again. What a horrible experience. The food lacked variety. The dim sum was cold. And the service was super slow.   I tried Orchids Garden a few days before, and they were 10x better than this place. More dim sum selection, service was great, and reasonable price. When we left Orchids, we were stuffed and yet we paid less there than Pings.",

I thought I saw a yeti leave the kitchen area with his hands in his armpits, trying to stay warm on his way to the restroom.  On second thought, that might've been our server because the \"service\" we were afforded was GROSS.    We were scolded for standing in the empty take-out line instead of the empty dine-in line (we'd changed our minds),  the servers (we had a couple on this slow night) were hard pressed to make any eye contact - we actually had a server deliver food to the table with her back to us?  How'd she do that??  I was looking for skates at that point.  In one moment I made accidental eye contact with the server and grinned as my mouth was full of mediocre Seafood Noodles.  I could almost hear her straining as she squeezed out a smirk.  A smirk.  And I'm not even kidding.  I was kidding about the yeti but the smirk was SO real.  We recognized one of the bus boys by his warm smile and friendly service.  I'm so annoyed with myself for not getting his name this time so I could give him propers.  He was a tropical island floating in a sea of ice.  In any event, the food.  The first time I came here I had Seafood Noodles and they rocked harder than Meatloaf.  Memory is a funny thing.  This time, there was little seafood and the bit present wasn't really a great mix.  I had one or two shrimp and a fistful of squid.  Had it been called Squid Noodles I'd have been happy.  The noodles were oily and the overall flavor wasn't anything to write home about.  We also had Salt and Pepper Calamari - which was more squ-  I mean, nice.  The calamari was tender  In the end, the check came to about $20 for both of us and still, I felt bad tipping because the service was Bizarro World grade.  I've never had dim sum here but if this is how they do business on a slow night I'll pass on dim sum.",

    "text": "Went here for dinner with a friend after we arrived to Vegas at around dinnertime. After finding the name funny we decided to check it out. It was really busy with a lot of older Asian people which we thought was a good sign since they are normally picky about Chinese food. We were daring and ordered three dishes: Stir fried lamb with vegetables, combination spicy chow mein and a scallop in oyster sauce hot pot. The prices were reasonable at around $8 to $10 a dish. We also got hot tea, rice and each got a bowl of soup for free with our meal. The food was delicious. We were worried about the scallop hot pot because normally scallops are overcooked and taste chewy. But here, the scallops melted because they were perfectly cooked. Also, the sauce included cloves of roasted garlic that were just as good as the scallops. We ended up finishing all of our food without feeling greasy or gross like at many other Chinese places. A bonus is being able to see into the kitchen and watching the chefs cook the food.  Tried the dim sum here. Surprised at the price at only $2.88 and $3.88 per dish. Friendly service and rather quick seating even when they were really busy.",

    "text": "Came here by the recommendation of a friend, who along with others, classified this as the best Chinese restaurant in Vegas. It was a bit tough to find, but that's expected with most restaurants in Vegas hotels. Let's skip the details and just go straight to the food:  - King Du Pork Chops: Very tender for pork, but tasted a lot like orange chicken, minus the chicken part. Pretty good dish overall if you like that Panda Express takeout taste.  - Walnut Prawns: Somehow every place I go to has their own spin on walnut prawns which makes them unique. Here, the batter was very thin, which is always good. Who wants to be eating more dough than shrimp? The shrimp themselves were quite large and the sauce not too sweet. One of the best walnut shrimps I've had.  - Lamb Stew: Definitely not what I expected, especially for the price. This basically consisted of broth with vegetables and pieces of stewed lamb, for about $20. The lamb itself was nothing too special, and neither was the entire dish. If I took some time, I could easily make this at home.  -  Tofu: I forgot which dish this was, but look at the pictures if you want a better idea. This was a pretty typical tofu dish that our veggie friend typically orders. It was full of flavour from the sauce, not too spicy, and done just right.  - Hot and Sour Soup: Also pretty typical, although I feel like they made it too sour. I love the consistency of this soup, which they got just right, but everything else was just so-so.  -  Veggie Noodles: I hate noodles that are way too fat, which is what you get typical takeout places. This, however, was the complete opposite. Nicely sized noodles, lots of veggies, and cooked well. Not much else to comment on.  - Gobo Beef: This was definitely the highlight of the night. The dish contained probably the softest beef I've ever had the pleasure of tasting. It pretty much melted in my mouth, and the sauce just made it that much better. This is a must have if you come here.  Overall, all of the dishes were pretty typical of a Chinese restaurant, with the exception of Gobo Beef. I'm sure there are better and more authentic Chinese places in Vegas, but this place was a pretty pleasant surprise in the overcrowded Vegas restaurant scene.",

    "text": "BEWARE OF THIEVING EMPLOYEES -- I had to make a yelp account to tell my story just in case anybody else has ever lost an item at this restaurant.   This past Sunday around 9pm I went to the restaurant with my family and was seated towards the front of the restaurant. We left the casino at 1130, and I realized I had lost my phone. We looked around the restaurant and casino for my phone, but it was no where to be found. After an hour or two, my mother decided to go back while I searched for it in the car and other places.   As soon as she walked into the restaurant (she didn't even say a word), the employees aggressively approached my mother by telling her they didn't have the phone and to stop asking because they do not have it. My mom felt that something was wrong because they were acting so defensive, so she called security to file a complaint. Her and the security looked over the table but sure enough my phone was no where to be found. About five minutes after security left the restaurant, they \"just happened to find my phone.\" It is a busy restaurant, the table was at the front of the entrance, the employees supposedly cleaned the table thoroughly, and this was over a span of a few hours. After a couple of hours, how did they just happen to find my phone especially when they aggressively kept telling us they looked and found nothing.   To top it all off, I called my phone about 30 times, yet all of the missed calls were magically erased. Also, since I called my phone so much, how did not one person in the restaurant hear or see it vibrate.   Obviously this restaurant has no integrity, and they only returned the phone after we got security involved. It is unlikely that a customer would return the phone after a few hours of keeping it, and it is so ironic that my phone was returned a few minutes after security arrived.    I have no respect for how this restaurant handled this issue, and I suggest everybody keep their belongings close.",

The line wasn't too bad for us, and we were seated shortly, even though it was on a Sunday at ~11:30am.  The restaurant itself seems small, especially compared to the other dim sum options i Vegas.  The price overall is more expensive, and is to be expected for a restaurant located inside a casino (Gold Coast).  The per person charge for tea is only $0.50!  That is the lowest I have ever seen, even compared to off-strip dim sum joints.  But then they do make it up on everything else you can order.  The wait staff is friendly, but I think they are assigned way too many tables to watch over, especially the busperson, since our emptied plates rarely gets picked up after we finished whatever dim sum we had ordered, and the table looks like it is in a constant state of disarray. Not exactly adding to the mood of the meal. But our water glass was refilled on a regular basis, which is good. That applies to the tea pots as well.  Food-wise, I think it is just okay.  There were some highlights but also many that was not worth ever trying again.  The Panfried Shrimp and Chive Dumpling was excellent. The \"fat noodles\" stirred fried with XO Sauce (my pinyin sucks but I will try to type it... Stir Fried ChanFun with XO Sauce) is good and we ended up ordering two plates. HarGow (Steamed Shrimp Dumpling), was made with great fillings, but the skin was way too thick and you can tell that the cooks or prep cooks that make them lack the skills normally developed over many years of making dim sum.  But what do you expect from a casino restaurant that might have a really good chef, but the rest of the kitchen are cooks, prep cooks, etc that are just happy to still have a job in a state that has stupidly high unemployment rate.  Anyway, back to the food. They seem to have trouble keeping up with the demand for the essential dim sums (steamed shrimp and steamed pork dumplings), since we didn't see the Hargow until we were almost ready to get them to tally up our bill. And the Shuimai never made it to the area we were seated until we were collecting money from everyone at the table.  I did kind of enjoyed their Green Tea Mochi Cake, although the mochi was on the thick side. But I have never had this at any other dim sum restaurants in the US. The Mango Coconut Tapioca was good, according to my friend (I didn't try it).  And even though we have a party of 8, they did NOT automatically add in the \"mandatory\" service charge/tips.  I think that was cool, but we paid over the 15% anyways.  Overall, just a 3 stars dim sum experience for me, and I will likely not returned for just dim sum. But it is nice to eat at a dim sum place that at least have above average customer service.",

Despite being tucked away in the Gold Coast casino this place was packed with Chinese & English speakers alike.  My boyfriend and I got the pot stickers which were incredible. The filling was way more flavorful and, well, filling, than other pot stickers I've had. Every bite had a nice amount of it. We then shared the Night Market Fried Rice. Holy macaroni! A substantial plate of rice with a good amount of beef in it for $10?! The ingredients were fresh, providing a taste that was less heavy-laden than most fried rice. The beef was fresh as well - beef can sometime make my stomach go topsy-turvy, but it didn't this time - indicating quality beef cooked properly.  I wish this place was in my hometown. I'd like to visit them regularly.",

I recommend coming here as early as you can, it opens at 10am and the line starts to get crazy around lunchtime.  Everything is delicious and our favorites are the flat rice noodles and the BBQ pork buns. There's also these triangle shaped dim sum filled with beef which are amazing! It is so convenient because these carts come around to each table, filled with all the dim sum and as you select each plate, they add a stamp to your table's sheet. Definitely a must for every time we are in vegas!",

Then, a team member states she will notify the front that I'm waiting to place my order.  Well, honestly, I don't think that happened because I took the initiative to go to the front team members and indicate that I'd like to place a to go order.  She gives me a menu that indicates dim sum associated with letters.  Then, I ask what do these letters indicate?  After, she hands me another menu with pictures and numbers.  I ask her how does this work?  Then, I asked the other lady at the front how do I know how much the dim sum with the numbers cost?  She indicates that the menu with the dim sum and letters are invalid.  So, the menu with the pics and numbers, how do I know how much the items cost?  She mentions oh just ask me.    What?  In other words, you could rip me off with no basis?    Total wait time + ordering + verifying the menu, prices, etc. = ~45min.    With that said, I highly recommend a revised dim sum menu with correct prices displayed for the customers' and establishments' maximum efficiency, time, ease, respect, and ethics in food service management.    Plus, I recommend more staff training accommodating those waiting to dine in, to go, and pay their bill because after observing this establishment while waiting for to go service, it seemed like there was a lack of communication between team members that was very obvious, no team work, and lack of organization.    In conclusion, I highly recommend the general manager, staff, and anyone involved in running this establishment to review training in customer service, food service management 101, and menu development.",

    "text": "This place is small so often times it requires a wait.  This is the 2nd dim sum place i've tried in vegas and was not disappointed at all.  Between the two of us, we ordered a bunch of traditional dim sum dishes including chickens feet =).  It came out to be about 15 a person I believe and we were both stuffed!  My favorite dish is probably the pork and preserved egg congee.  I was surprised at how good it was!  Could have eaten that whole bowl myself.  The Siu Mai (pork dumpling)  and Ha Gow (shrimp dumpling) satisfies my dim sum craving.  The banana leaf wrapped rice was good.  The tofu skin roll and spare ribs also tasted delicious.  I think I Iiked everything except for the tofu pudding I got at the end.  You can definitely tell they made it from some processed powder in a box.  Was not freshly made.  Service is good.  Since the place is small they only have so many carts pushing around.  Some servers were nicer than others but overall I would definitely come back.  This is better than Orchid Garden in chinatown.   Although it has a terrible terrible name, its my favorite place in vegas so far.  Its located inside gold coast so just walk around the casino and look for it.  Wait times can be long during weekend brunch but I think its quite worth it.  If you've been to many high quality dim sum places...it won't compare.  I definitely think SF and LA has way better spots but I live in Vegas now so beggars can't be choosers.",

However, there's a flat fee per person for a pot of Chinese Restaurant Tea. The dim sum was delicious. However, I didn't like how the windows on the dim sum cart weren't very visible. I felt that the dim sum could have been more presentable!  We got the following:  1. A bowl of steamed rice topped with chinese mushroom, diced chicken in bone, and ginger. It was served in a tall wooden bamboo looking container. It came with soy sauce on the side. I felt that the rice was a bit bland. I didn't like how the chicken had small little bones.  2. Eggplant topped with shrimp in black bean sauce. It came in 3. It was tasty but on the oily side.  3. Pan Fried Sticky Rice Cake filled with Red Bean Paste on a round banana leaf. It came in 3. It was crispy on the top, sweet and savory.  4. Steamed Beancurd Wrapped Tofu Ball topped with English Peas, Corn, and Chinese Mushroom.  5. Steamed Crystal Shrimp Dumpling. It came in 4. I liked how there were big pieces of shrimp and no fillers in the dumpling.  6. Steamed Fish Paste Ball, which came in 3, consisted of fish paste, coriander, diced Chinese sausage, topped with a gojiberry, and over a bed of enoki mushroom.  7. Steamed Roast Pork Buns, which came in 3 and were fresh from the oven.  8. Chinese style Crepe filled with crispy dough and shrimp and topped with soy sauce and scallion.  9. Steamed Beef Ball, which came in 3, consisted of beef and parsley, served over a bed of beancurd, and drizzled with A1 sauce.  10. Steamed Sticky Rice with sausage, scallion, egg, and dried shrimp. I was surprised there wasn't any Chinese mushroom.  11. Egg Custard Tart. I liked how the crust was slightly burnt!",

Now, it is literally the centerpiece piece of the casino. I was told that it moved to the new location around May 2017. The new digs are a far cry from the old school, Chinese kitchen that gave it so much character. The new restaurant feels like a corporate sell-out, but I'll keep an open mind.  I dined with three work colleagues who were less familiar with dim sum. They are adventurous eaters, and seemed to enjoy the experience. We tried all the traditional dishes, and I thought everything was very good. Two dishes that really stood out to me were the sticky rice and the shrimp chow fun. I thought these were some of the best EVER.",

Last, the Chinese broccoli had a very strong ginger seasoning, but was good nonetheless. The only con I have is that all of this cost about $75 dollars for the 4 dishes. I most likely won't be eating here too often, but I consider it one of the best Chinese spots in the desert.",

Not authentic dim sum.. we ordered duck and it was served cold. They took and said they will heat it?? They brought it back it was dry! We asked for hot mustard, and they only have one type.. honey mustard??? Who eats dim sum with honey mustard??  All the dim sum we got did not taste fresh! We also ordered won ton mein... it was very bland and the wonton tasted sour ewww, cup of noodle taste better than that! Staff were every rude. Didn't get a refill on drinks and prices were outrageous for the quality! I wish I read the reviews.",

Mom enjoyed the chicken feet, dad the baked pork buns (I thought it was a bit too sweet). We also had har gow, pork ribs (yum!), red bean gelatin dessert (this was good), red bean buns (my dad was desperate for food by this time). Service was good - prompt removal of plates, refilling of tea pot.   It's super noisy there. Near impossible to have a conversation across the table. This is most likely a Las Vegas casino complaint (?), but the entire restaurant smelled like an ashtray. I'm sensitive to smoke, so this was a less-than ideal eating situation.   The bill, for three people (two elderly people in their 80s and one female) was $60. That is stratospherically high for people who don't eat much. And the smell. It was awful. Will not be visiting again.",

    "text": "A mixed bag, I recall that it was much better pre-renovation and they raised their prices.  Good news is that you can use your Bconnected (Boyd) points.  The roast duck had the right amount of seasoning and was decently tender.  However, the biggest flaw was the skin was soggy and not crispy at all.  My dad made roast duck at the now closed Mini-Garden on Hotel Street in Honolulu Chinatown so I know that this a big no no.  Amazingly, if you are looking for a good roast duck, the Caesar's buffet is where you will find it.  The won ton noodles soup broth was spot on, without the usual massive amounts of msg and was infused with the a perfect amount of white pepper.  Won ton was ok, but the noodles was either overcooked or poor quality (not enough egg used), as it was too soft and not enough hardness like the ones you get at Louie's Noodle Shop (you can buy their uncooked noodles nearby on Reno Ave).  The san pan tiger prawns was a big disaster.  Description was it was in shell with \"aged soy sauce with garlic and shallots\".  Not even close, looks like they used the leftover shrimp from their hau gau and stir fried it.  The only saving grace from being a two star review is the enoki mushroom fried tofu with pickled cabbage.  This is an excellent dish, the tofu has a nice fried exterior with a soft inside.  The enoki mushrooms and the pickled cabbage provides other complimentary flavors to the dish.  Perhaps trying only their dim sum is a better option.",

Nice restaurant and ambiance and I like that they do dim sum old-school but with new touches (i.e. rolling carts that are well-lit and encased in clear 'showcases'). The dim sum dishes are really good. Some favorites: char siu bun, stewed beef offal (pair this with rice porridge with a thousand year egg for maximal enjoyment), and their take on the youtiao (\"fried oil stick\")/cheungfun combo, using prawn/shrimp paste as a filler, surrounded by a youtaio-like covering and then the cheung fun wrap mixed with cilantro... that's a killer and my personal favorite. Some solid sweet dim sum options but my favorite will always be the classic tofu fa, which they do serve here.  Worth walking through an otherwise underwhelming, cigarette-smoke-smelling, old-fashioned off-strip casino.",

We went in for an after graduation celebratory dinner late Friday night and were so excited because it was completely empty and we had a party of 17. Soon we would find out why it was empty. They put two round tables together. The food came out promptly after being ordered, but then we never saw our servers again. We had to go look for her when we needed drink refills or to order something additional. We even had to find them to get our check. I realize with a group of our size gratuity is automatic but I definitely felt cheated because it was not earned. All staff were very short and seemed bothered by our presence. I did not speak to a manager at the time because it was our daughter's special night but I have no intention of going back and definitely will not be recommending this place to anyone. It's to bad because we enjoyed the food.",

Being the crotchety impatient hangry monster that I am and usually only having time for dim sum on weekends, I've mostly avoided Ping Pang Pong so as to not have to go out to the almost-strip and wait in an impossibly long line.   Fortunately, I was able to try PPP for a quick snack between the 1pm and 3pm bingo sessions. As it was almost time for the kitchen to close, we were seated immediately and swarmed just as quickly with carts of food.  The swarming froze of my girlfriends into a sense of panic, but that eventually faded when the food was ordered and the dim sum-slangin ladies directed their attention elsewhere.   I was a bit concerned about the quality of the food since we arrived right at about closing time. However, all of the food was delicious. We focused on seafood and vegetarian/vegan items to accommodate a few dietary needs at the table. As I've said time and time again, Asian food is kind to the diet-restricted.   The egg tarts were outstanding. I haven't had a good one in a while and appreciated how warm and buttery PPP's were.   This meal was the perfect snack for a group that hadn't eaten lunch who also fully intended to have another round of drinks at the 3pm bingo session.   Can't beat dim sum for a quick, cheap, but satisfying meal.",

Located in the Gold Coast Hotel/Casino,  just blocks away from \"Little Chinatown\", this place has some of the best wonton noodle soup around!!  Wontons are a good size with an awesome flavorful pork mixture.    If there's one dish that I can eat for lunch and dinner, it's the crispy roasted chicken... 1/2 chicken roasted so the skin is just a little crispy and the meat is just infused with this braised sweet chili soy sauce.  Pair this over steamed rice and I'll salivate over this every time!  Every restaurant has their take on orange peel chicken... and this dish is done well here.  Chicken is lightly battered, deep fried and lightly coated with a fragrant sweet orange sauce.  You won't find a pool of orange goopy sauce on the bottom of the plate!  If you're going to make a trip to a chinese restaurant near Spring Mountain Road, Ping Pong Pang is just a couple blocks away and is definitely worth going to!",

They didn't have a lot of options and there was only 2 carts going around the whole time. They ran out of items and so we were limited to whatever was left. Next time I would just order take out or go elsewhere for dim sum where it's more options and better service at least.",

    "text": "This review is for 3.5 stars.  I came here on a week night at about 6pm looking for some good Chinese food.  Ping Pang Pong is located in the Gold Coast so I expected the price to be a bit higher than normal but was actually pleased as it was very consistent with other sit-down Chinese restaurants in town.    The portions are very big here and very fresh.  They are known for their dim sum so I had to at least try some of their dinner dim sum to give a True review.  I had the pork buns dim sum, lettuce cups, and BBQ pork ribs.  Add in a few drinks and the bill came out to $44 after tax.  The pork bun was just eh.  I usually like the steamed bun but this came with a dessert-type of crust which caught me off guard.  Tasty innards, but not much going on in the way of a dish.  The lettuce cups were quite tasty and I actually recommend them as a nice appetizer.  Finally, the BBQ ribs were average - still can't find an authentic Chinese BBQ char siu in town.  The meat was good but not much flavor.  And the bone was so large that there wasn't much meat on each cutlet (though there were many ribs on the plate).  The dish came with some boiled peanuts which were a nice addition to the meal.    Service was all over the place.  I'm not sure if it was busy or what but the waitress would disappear and then show up and take 6 orders before returning to the kitchen.  So your order wouldn't be placed immediately, rather you have to wait until her rounds were up.  Very weird way of doing business but the food came out quickly and we were in and out quickly after just waiting a long time to place the order.  Ping Pang Pong is good Chinese food.  I prefer local when trying Asian cuisine in this town so I won't be back, but if you are staying at Gold Coast or nearby and don't have a car, and are craving non-American Chinese, then give this location a try.",

    "text": "Having a family member who gambles through the night til the sunrise means comps and free food. We frequent here because other dining place in Gold Coast Hotel sucks so bad and Ping Pang Pong is the only decent place besides Noodle Exchange (their beef combination noodle is yummers!  but that's besides the point).   SERVICE Service is terrible. Servers here are slower than a turtle. However, I do want to talk about their cleaning guys (two brothers). They clean dirty dishes and wipe tables like there's no tomorrow. Holy moly. They could easily win 1st place at table cleaning contest if there's such thing. It's worth watching them while your servers takes her sweet time getting your orders.  FOOD Some of my favorites that I get every time:  Sea Bass Hot Pot ($19.95)- it's one of their secret menu. Mainly tofu and fried sea bass with lots of garlic. Little bit pricey but worth it. Yum yum.  Walnut Prawns ($13.95)- fried shrimp with sesame mayonnaise and honey-glazed walnuts. It's the ultimate fatty dish with lots of cholesterol but it's so dang good.   Tea Smoked Duck ($16.95)- roasted duck in a wrap with boison sauce on the side. I can eat this everyday!  Chicken with Black Bean Sauce ($9.95)- goes well with a bowl of white rice   Shanghai Noodles ($7.95)- stir-fried Napa cabbage, mushrooms, spinach and pork  Singapore Rice Noodles ($9.95)- noodles with light curry flavor.   Garlic Bok Choy- Always ask for extra garlic!  Last but most definitely not least, thier mango pudding. Comes with creamer on the side. They make fresh mango pudding here and it is the most flavorful and refreshing dessert. My family of 3 always order about 10 of these LOL   *dim sum here is alright. Much rather go to other places.   CONCLUSION Their service sucks but delicious food makes up for it.",

Panda Express is more authentic.   Service was horrible, food was over cooked as it tasted like it was steamed many hours from yesterday's leftovers.  They kept pushing around the same 3 carts over and over with less and less of a selection. This is as authentic as Mexican food is to Taco Bell. I feel sorry for the people waiting in a long line to get in, normally with a big wait you would expect awesome food. I think most of the customers were from group tours or were offered free food for staying in the run down hotel/casino, as I can't picture anyone from Asia wanting to try this place.",

Mostly Chinese who do not speak English had a hard time asking if pork was in certain dim sum or not. I thought the shrimp noodle was the best thing I tried. Something was odd about the fact they didn't have our favorite, har gow. It was interesting that they had boba and Thai tea but I'm sure some people would like that. Not fancy not extra nice nothing compared to more authentic style dim sum found in chinatowns around the world. There was a mix up on our order and they brought us the wrong dish which we didn't get charged for. Management was helpful. Everyone who ate there right after started complaining of stomach pains and side effects of too much msg in the food too... hmm..",

We sat at a table where we could see the line -- it was continually long up until we left at around 2pm. With all the waiting and the lines, you would think this place is really off the chain.   No! It wasn't. Food was mediocre and the actual restaurant is quite small. It seemed like the carts were scarce and we were constantly stopping the same carts over and over again. Price was decent but not worth the money for the so-so food.   I wanted to like Ping Pang Pong... Everyone, even locals, have told me this place is good but I didn't like it.

The roast pork (which I'd never had before), shrimp dumplings, and the green vegetable sides were my favorite dishes, and everything was at least decent. While we did not have a problem getting a seat at 11:30AM on a Saturday, our local friend told us that long waits are not unusual here so be prepared. The service is typical of dim sum places (kinda rushed), but generally acceptable. Prices were in line with dim sum in Los Angeles (i.e. less than the overpriced Strip restaurants). Overall, worth the drive to Gold Coast if you're in town and hankering for dim sum. And, still plenty of free parking...",

Hostess was not very welcoming and kept scolding us to stand inside the stanchion and to stay behind the line!  Not the greatest start, but luckily once I started eating, the experience took a 180 turnaround.  Located in the Gold Coast, this little Chinese restaurant serves up some mean dim sum.  So elegantly presented, each simple dim sum item takes Chinese dining to another level.  Delectable roast pork, cooked with a nice crispy layer of skin, thinly sliced and served with shelled boiled peanuts...what?  Who would've thought of that?  Then there was this super light custard made from egg whites served in a bowl and covered with a light pastry puff.  Who said dessert at the end?  We had to start with this popular dish before they ran out!  I kept saying I can't eat another bite and then another cart would come by with another beautiful dish.  They are so smart.  Even if you say no, they always unveil, just to make sure you know what you are saying no to.  Before you know it, one more dish added to our table!  Overall great experience and definitely recommend if you love dim sum.  I'm so glad I stood within the stanchion and behind the line.  Totally worth the scoldings!",

I would call to make sure it's open if close to 3pm. Gold Coast number is 702-367-7111  I took a star off for service. I've came here about 100 times over the last decade so clearly I like this place but the service should be better in my opinion. Sometimes the service is okay but other times it takes awhile just to get seated and you gotta wave them down to get refills.

Last night we finally tried their dim sum and boy do I regret not coming sooner.  My mom got a $40 complementary voucher to any of their restaurants, and I thought what better time than now to try it. Nestled inside the Gold Coast casino sits this hidden gem. They have a separate line for to go orders which was really convenient and dinner rush hasn't started yet so it wasn't as crazy as expected, though there were a lot of people dining in already.   Their dim sum list isn't quite as large as some of the others in town so we tried all of them, some double orders. Each order was $3.88 if I recall correctly. Everything that we tried I liked, a lot! Their shumai and  Har gow shrimp dumpling was delicious, so was the shrimp with chives. The pork bun was one of the best I've had in town. They also had this bun that had lap cheong (Chinese sausage) inside which was very savory and mouth watering. For dessert we got sesame balls, coconut buns and mango pudding, all 3 were great. Their fried rice had great flavors but I didn't like the use of jasmine rice. I can't give 5 stars as I have not experienced dining there and tried most of their menu, but return visits are already in the works.",

    "text": "Not great.  Not terrible.  We all presumed that a Chinese restaurant catering to what appeared on this night to be 95% Asian community would have hit all the right notes.  San Pan Tiger Prawns were very good.  Head, legs, and tail on.  Spiced just right.  Fried enough that legs crunched to powder and head held together and juicy.  Ma Po Tofu with Pork was edible.  Not good.  There were flavors missing.  The heat was right with Szechuan pepper.  Its just that no other flavors seemed present.  Lots of tofu not enough pork. Bland.  Noodles were completely tasteless.  Mo Shoo Pork was excellent.  No question.  It came as an appetizer.  Two large pre-filled rices pancakes.  At first bite i realized it needed Hoisin sauce. The next bite made me realize I needn't ask for it as it was already in there.  Wood ear mushrooms even.  Plenty of pork and veggies.  The price for all this was under $60.  Myself and two Partners-in-Dine would have been happier if the food tasted as good as those few dishes did.  When we were ready to pay our check there were no servers on the floor. We realized an entire table of six or seven eating dinner one table over from ours were the entirety of floor STAFF having dinner together.  We had to get up and pay at the register waiting in line behind several other diners waiting to pay their bills.  I think under normal circumstances we would have paid our server.  What happened tonight I am not sure.  I don't believe any of us were so in love or even like with our food that we would go out of our way to return.",

    "text": "Our second day of $25 food credit, we decided to try the Dim Sum again here.    Our visit this time seemed better.  I liked the food and the service.  You can't compare this with all the Dim Sum restaurants in So Cal, but Ping Pang Pong gets the job done with some of the classic dishes; Ha Gaw (Shrimp Dumpling), BBQ Pork Buns (both baked and steamed), Sticky Rice Wrap, Salty Sticky Rice Dumpling, Sesame Balls, Porridge, Egg Tarts, Chiese Broccoli, Fried Shrimp Balls, and so on and so on.  It seemed like they had more varieties this time than I remembered.  It could be because we were there earlier than last time, too.    Do get there earlier than later or there will be a wait (and also they don't run out of your favorites)  since the place isn't very big.  The prices are fairly reasonable.  Most dishes are around $2.88 (for B dishes).   We tried to order enough to use up our $25 food credit and ended up packing some left over to go (ate it for breakfast the next day).   I've tried going to Dim Sum at the restaurants on Spring Mountain Road and it was almost impossible due to the wait time.  I'd much rather come here.  If you're in the mood for Dim Sum, give this place a try.",

Well I am completely in love with their Hong Kong style crispy noodles. & just as of yesterday I have fallen for their dim sum! I mean I ordered about 6-7 dishes during dim sum and it was only 10 bucks! If that was harbor palace at Chinatown that would have been a quick $20-30.

We went for dim sum Sunday at 11am. We got the last table before the long line began!   Service was really good. Shrimp har-gow was hot, fresh, and tasty. The shrimp noodle was delicious! The steamed pork buns and the glazed pork buns were good. The pork dumplings were tasty, although came with sweet and sour sauce (odd?). For the four of us, it was about $30. The hostess and cashier were very nice and attentive. The cooks were all old chinese men which was a plus. It looked pretty legit.  I will definitely come back when I'm in Vegas and craving dim sum. Food was good, prices were good, service was excellent! The place is pretty small and there aren't a ton of carts. I wasn't expecting much since its Vegas and there aren't as many chinese people here than in Cali. Since I came with no expectations, it was nice to leave full and satisfied.

All of these restaurants would hover around 3 stars and dipped as low as being inedible depending on change of chefs and perhaps even ownership.  Then along came the idea of trying Ping Pang Pong inside the Gold Coast casino.  The litmus test for dim sum for me are the cheong fun, the har gow, the oven baked char siu bao, chicken feet, and anything with shrimp.  While the sauce of the cheong fun was very light, the noodles were soft and the shrimp were fresh. The har gow skin was soft and the shrimp again fresh.  The char siu bao was the right combination of sweet and salty.  Chicken feet were not too soft and not too hard.  Did I mention the shrimp were fresh?!  Yes, it's considerably pricier than all the other dim sum restaurants I mentioned but it's worth it.  And yes, it's also frigid cold like another reviewer said because that's how casinos keep you awake but it's nothing hot tea and a sweater can't fix.  And yes, it can get very crowded since it's actually a fairly small dining room for a dim sum restaurant, not to mention a dim sum restaurant in a casino known for its Asian clientel, but go before 11:30 am and you'll be fine since most are either at the gambling tables or are sleeping in from being at the gambling tables all night.",

So the order is put in for roast duck, fried rice and walnut shrimp. We start eating and drinking our sodas and no one comes by with refills so at this point I just want to eat and leave but nope. They just walk by and don't acknowledge us at all. So I had to get up and pay for the meal at the front desk and tell them straight up I'm not tipping them. The girl at the counter just looks and me and doesn't say anything at all. I will not be dining there at all in the future until they know how to treat their customers. I wasn't the only unhappy person either another table was pissed they couldn't order either. I hope they don't expect people to go back just because of the food. Order to go or something if you really want to eat there.",

    "text": "This place is great. When we got there 1pm on a Saturday afternoon during a holiday long weekend it was busy. I am not sure if this was usual, but we waited for about 15 min which was fine. Its located inside the casino so there is plenty of scenery to look at while you wait. Doesn't matter if your really hungry, because the moment you hit your table hundreds of Delicious hot dim sum dishes are coming around your table to choose and ask what is what. All of the food looks so different and tasty so be careful when picking because its easy to overload your table with these dishes. lol All the food was incredible. The service was quick and efficient. We will definalty be back!  Oh and if you want to work some calories off after lunch or dinner, there is a bowling ally just upstairs from the restaurant! it was only 12 bucks for my hubby and I to play a game with show rentals!  Thanks Ping Pang Pong",

When they are busy or understaffed, and the managers step in to help, it goes down the drain.  They are slow, unattentive, and rude.  Eating by myself at Ping Pang Pong, a male manager waited on me one night.  After finishing my meal, I sat for 27 minutes (yes, I kept track) without receiving the check.  When I went to the front, where he was laughing with an employee, and asked for my check, he just rolled his eyes at me, and did not even apologize for the wait.",

Ping Pang Pong - let's just called it PPP - is also located within a Casino, namely the Gold Coast. The one big differentiation about this restaurant as opposed to others is that it's located far off the strip so the patrons are not visitors that just happen to walk by here. Most of the customers appear to be locals who drove here for the food.  For the most part the dishes are pretty tasty and fresh with high turnover rate. The roast duck was succulent, the salt and pepper smelt and the baked BBQ pork puff were delicious. We ordered a plate of stir-fried pea sprout greens and it was cooked just right.   One of the desserts was recommended by the restaurant and they are these red bean filled circular donut-like pastries dusted with granulated sugar. I find them to be overrated as the crust was dry and the filling was overly sweet.  Other than that PPP is a good place to go in Vegas for dim sum.",

Our server ignored us multiple times through out the night even though she saw us. That really dropped this rating down to 3. Food is really good though.

The food was pretty expensive (+$50) for what we got, but it may have been different if we had actually eaten at the restaurant and not ordered takeout.  The girls at the register were not very friendly and seemed uninterested and robotic.  I asked a coupe of questions about items on the menu and the girl seemed inconvenienced by having to answer.

The chicken was what was left on the bone after they chopped off the meat to put into other dishes. It was just cooked chicken. The same taste as you could get at Costco, but without the meat.   The orange chicken was really tough. The worst I have ever had.   Do not waste your time going here. You would get better food at a take out place!",

Food We had the following:  steamed chicken feet (good), baked bbq pork bun (very good), shrimp hargow (very good), fried sesame ball (very good), steamed pork spareribs (most of the pieces had too much fat), eggrolls (2 plates half had holes and were burnt, but good), baked egg tart (very good-only 2 on plate but they were big), sticky rice in lotus leaf (only 1 on plate and pretty bad-way toooooo much soy sauce or whatever sauce is part of it), rice noodle roll with shrimp (very good), and bean curd skin (horrible-way too much meat-it didn't taste normal-almost dumpling like, no bamboo shoots).  Service For 3/4 of the plates we had, we had to flag people down get the food.  Once we asked for them to calculate our bill, it took about 10 minutes.  NEVER had to wait this long at any dim sum place to get bill.  Once I received the bill, I went to the front to pay.  There were two people up front handling the bills and payments.  No one was in line to pay but they were finishing ringing up the bill for another table.  I thought I would be next since I was just standing there waiting.  No.  One lady just started doing some other stuff, while I patiently waited.  This lady then went behind the screen and was given another bill and they processed this one before me-I'm just still standing there so I turned my back on them and looked out at the casino for about 2-3 minutes.  Finally, they said excuse me so I turned around and I thought that I can now finally pay my bill.  The other lady thought they were processing my bill, but the first lady said that it wasn't mine, so I had to wait another 30 seconds before they finally took my bill.  I don't expect very good service at Chinese restaurants, but the experience I had regarding the bill calculation and paying the bill takes my Chinese restaurant experience to a brand new low.",

    "text": "Not a band place to try, been here several times.....  1.  Parking - A bit of a hike as you have to go to the Gold Coast Casino parking and then walk to the restaurant. So it is what it is. Not to bad, not too close.  2.  Ambiance - I knock off a star for it being or having a very odd feeling. It is kinda open to the casino floor, and it seems to be that the restaurant was stuck here, rather than designed to be here.  You have to walk through the smokey casino to get to the restaurant and then there is always a lingering amount of smoke from the people smoking outside the restaurant.  3.  Note - You have to go to use the casino bathrooms, which while they are not far at all, you still have to go through the casino. Not an issue if you are a casino lover.  4.  Food - Not bad.  The carts of dim sum did not seem to weave an order that I could detect.  You have to flag them down. The food itself is good, yet when you have to search out the cart , wait and wait it dampers the experience a bit.  For this I knock off 1/2 a star.  5.  Service - Not bad, but kinda like \"we are busy\" and \"you should be happy to wait for a table\" type attitude.  This type of attitude does not bother me greatly, however, it also does not endear loyalty and a pleasant experience. With so many great restaurants opening up that serve dim sum, they need to up their game.  What happened?  They used to be highly rated and I find them to be pretty good, yet not highly rated.  Worth a try for sure.",

The salt and pepper pork chops had tiny bones that almost chipped my teeth variety of times and was also lacking salt.  The fried noodles lacked sauce and was very bland in flavor.   I also was restless the whole night and had diarrhea the following morning which is from the MSG that you put. I am not happy about the food you serve even if the remodeling makes it appear nice",

    "text": "3.5 STARS  Yay! It's hella Chinesey up in here!  Normally you can judge how good an Asian restaurant is by the amount of native diners. Vegas is no exception.  Ping Pang Pong came as a recommendation from my friend who lives in Vegas but he did warn me it's not nearly as good as the dim sum in SF..   On Sunday, 9.11.11, my friends and I came to PPP at 1 PM. It was about a 15 minute wait for a party of 7. The FIRST thing I noticed was the overwhelming amount of Mandarin and Cantonese speaking patrons; seemed promising.  FOOD Ladies push around dim sum carts and call out the dishes in Cantonese. They are more than happy to show you what's inside the steamers if you don't understand Cantonese.  We ordered the following (some in doubles): *Hai Gow (Steamed Shrimp Dumplings) *Siu Mai (Steamed Pork Dumplings) *Hai and Char Siu Cheung Fun (Steamed Shrimp and BBQ Pork Noodle Rolls) *Fung Zhao (Steamed Chicken Feet) *Ngau Yuk Mai (Steamed Beef Balls) *Jiaozi (Potstickers) *Deep Fried Shrimp Balls *Paai Gwaat (Steamed Spare Ribs) *Ngau Toa (Steamed Tripe) *Fu Pei Guen (Steamed Tofu Skin Roll) *Lo Mai Gai (Steamed Glutinous Rice w/ Chicken in Lotus Leaf Wrap) *Jin Deui (Fried Sesame Balls) *Char Siu Chow Fan (BBQ Pork Fried Rice)  The only standout dishes was the steamed tripe which was melt-in-your-mouth soft and the fried rice which was al-dente which bits of rich fatty pieces of pork (albeit a bit greasy).  The rest of the dishes were mediocre; they either lacked quality ingredients, were tiny (dumplings) compared to the norm and/or on the dry side. But when you're starving and there's a lack of good dim sum options, it sufficed just fine.  S E R V I C E Perhaps, I'm so use to rude service at Asian restaurants that I didn't find the service at PPP even the slight bit rude. Our waiter brought things quickly when we asked for it and refilled our waters promptly. This in itself is already a rarity in most Chinese restaurants.   A M B I A N C E / D E C O R With a name like Ping Pang Pong, it's no wonder that it excudes the typical stereotypical decor of Chinese village roof shingles, red paper lanterns and waitstaff in mandarin collared outfits. Most importantly, It was CLEAN!  With a plethora of dim sum restaurants in San Francisco, PPP would probably rank a 2.5-3 STARS in SF. However, considering Vegas has a scant amount of decent Asian restaurants and we left stuffed for only $15/person (including tip) they do deserve a better than average rating.",

The place was quite small, which meant that carts went around to all the tables.   Overall, the dim sum was quite tasty.  The dishes we enjoyed the most were the assorted sweet and savory buns as well as the Shrimp Cheong Fun with plump shrimps.  The Sui Miu was tasty with the right amount of meat as was the tofu wrap.  There were a few misses.  The shrimp dumpling (har gow) was bland tasting shrimp with mushy, thick wrap. The Rice w/ Lotus Leaf (Lo Mai Gai) was mostly rice with minimal amount of meat and other ingredients.  The fried chicken wings were the worse with an odd mix of spices and too much grease.  We also ordered an item with rice and small spareribs. It was tasty but some of the ribs were fatty.  The dim sum dishes were inexpensive with dishes around $3 with generally tasty dishes and generous meat stuffing.",

Open late night, perfect for a night after clubbing.   MAKE SURE you order the lamb stew pot, comes with vegetable to add on after tasting the savory soup. The thing I like the most is the open kitchen configuration, you can hear the sound of wok, the breath of dragon chinese called. \"rawrrrrr\" that my friend  is fire stream out at a high temperature would sound. Like a big torch would sound. Mix with the ping ping sound of wok, the food come alive. Just something excites me. Authentic Cantonese cuisine demand good \"wok haye\" and able to hear it, it is just awesome.   Don't order the clam, menu said \"Big\", but it is really small clams. not worth 20 bucks.

DIM SUM IS WHAT'S FOR LUNCH Like most dim sum places you have women pushing around carts full of food asking if you want any of this or any of that, what they serve here is exactly what any other dim sum restaurant in SF would have. The food was okay and for sure did not and could not compare to the dim sum I get in SF but the BBQ pork fried rice was the best thing we had that afternoon. I'm going to go out on a limb here and say it was better than most BBQ pork fried rice dishes I've tried in SF. =X  SERVICE Our waiter was quick, he took drink orders down (he memorized the drink orders) and a couple minutes later he was back with all the drinks! DAMN! Then we asked for BBQ pork fried rice, a couple minutes if not a minute later he comes back with it!   CONCLUSION I definitely wouldn't mind coming back here and who knows, maybe during my next Vegas trip I'll make a return. =)",

The place is always bustling with activity while waitress with push carts go around to show you what's available. Just order from them directly :)  A few items to recommend : the Prawn Chee Cheong Fun , the Bolo Bao, cereal butter prawns, carrot cake, egg tarts.  Things to skip : stir fried bee hoon, Siew mai, har gao .  Please be aware that the restaurant is near the slots so be prepared to smell cigarette smoke spilling over into the area.  I recommend that you order chrysanthemum tea to go with your meal as it really helps to wash down well. Once you're done with 3/4 your pot, get someone to top it up to make sure it doesn't get too \"thick\".  Great place",

We were getting hungry and after about the 7th billboard, we decided that dim sum it is. We headed straight for the Gold Coast Hotel and luckily we still had about 50 mins before the dim sum ended at 3pm.  Ping Pang Pong might be a catchy name to entice Mid-Westerners into the establishment, but in Chinese, this place is actually called \"Golden Ingot\" -- a form of ancient Chinese currency. It is 'jin yuan bao\" in Mandarin or \"gum yuen bo\" in Cantonese.  We had to wait about 10 minutes for a table. After we were seated, the tea and water was promptly brought to the table. However, when it came time for the dim sum trolleys to come around, it took forever. We were starving. Surprisingly, when they did roll around, the quality of the dim sum was pretty good!! Much better than what we can get in Irvine. The chicken's feet was tasty, so were the har gow. In fact, the har gow were so good we got 2 orders.   Service sucks shit and after I handed in our ticket to pay, the bill never got to us. After a while I got sick of waiting and walked up to the counter to pay. If service was good they would've gotten a full 5-stars because to find such great quality of dim sum in a hotel like this, is absolutely incredible.",

Because even Japanese restaurant know better they don't bring you a fork to eat sushi.   ***WARNING Don't pay attention about yelpers complaining about service. This is not PF CHANGS, or Applebee's.***  The entry level dim sum is good (KJ Kitchen at the RIO makes the simple stuff better currently--- their LO Bak Go is so er mah gawd!). Reading other reviews on here is so funny because of complaints about service. Want to be seated? Wave some one down, ask loud, better yell it in Cantonese. Don't expect them to ask if you want water or soda. Expect tea and only tea, unless you wave someone down and ask loud for cold water, same with refills. (Although they do bring you large water glasses and it tastes good. As a kid growing up Chinese, I used to think they scoop the water out of the fish tanks because it did taste a bit fish. That must be because they keep the ice machine behind the fish tanks. No fish tanks at PING PANG PONG hahahaha.)   Bring someone Chinese with you if you are scared. Want more tea, shit you know what you have to do with the lid. Want to pay your check? Lift it in the air  \"Maaihdaan!!!!\" or go up to the Cashier and start picking your teeth with the tooth picks.  If there is old food lingering on your new plates... I wipe that shit off with hot tea and napkin.  What kind of service do people need?   If I read one more review about Orange Beef.... If you go in there ordering General Tso's expect bad service. Tea, take dirty dishes away, bring my food. It's all good in the Chinese hood. If you're scared go to Elephant bar, Jose or Sean Jean will make you something nice there. I'm not racist I eat black chicken.   Seriously about the service, you can have a good ole' dim sum time without making at the least bit eye contact. Oh and lastly, I think I read a review about hot mustard... do they have hot mustard? Hahahahahahahahahahahahahahaha. I'm not going to answer that expect a hahahahaha if you ask.   No seriously eating dim sum is not that hard. I'm just making fun. I gotta go piss off Japanese people by rubbing my wooden chopsticks together down the street while I contemplate what's so delicious about Teriyaki.   Ho Sek Ah!",
