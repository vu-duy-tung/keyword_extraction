It's better than places like robertos and etc. Its quicker, and honestly, the service has always been great. Don't believe all the other yelpers! Give this place an honest try. You would most likely leave satisfied!",

    "text": "WHY DO THE EMPLOYEES WEAR GLOVES?  Um, one would think that the gloves they wear, might make it so that they don't contaminate the food they handle! WRONG! The gloves don't matter, when the girl that took our order today, started preparing our food, handling the tortilla and cheese, after rubbing her hands (in gloves) off of her Nose, then wiped it off on the back seat of her dirty Jeans! Then, the Next Girl used a dish rag to wipe of the counter (where the lettuce and rice are), used the same dirty gloves hands to handle the lettuce! My wife even asked her (straight up) about that and she admitted it, then still sent the tins down the line.  We were disqusted, should have just left, but we paid and then just threw out the nasty food!  Also, before today, I already wanted to mention that the last three times we went there, the Rice was hard, completely under-cooked... beans too! I REALLY DON'T KNOW WHY I RETURNED AGAIN ANYWAYS! Incompetant staff of Teen-agers, wow, should we be so shocked?!   Also, as an added tid-bit to show how poorly run this crappy place is... please see my photo of the mystery drinks and especially enjoy the hygenic aluminum covered one! WTF? The management needs to be fired, along with all of the Nasty, filthy gloved, little teen-aged Girls!   This is the truth... eat E coli, AT YOUR OWN RISK!  THEY NEED TO START OVER!",

I love that they have daily specials. Those are really good deals. But once I tried that Chicken Tostada Salad it was over for me. I never order anything else. It is the perfect amount of chicken, cheese and beans of your choice. They pile high the fresh lettuce and top it with Pico and Sour Cream and a few Tortilla Chip Strips. The creamy dressing is my favorite.  This location is so busy. I could not believe how long the wait was. The staff was really friendly to everyone and they kept that line moving. The restaurant was also very clean and they had someone out there washing tables as soon as the guest would leave. Great location, great food!",

    "text": "I am posting this just to see if the corporate office pays attention to their customers. I went in around 2:30 PM Saturday, November 5 to buy the Shredded Chicken Salad, one of my favorites. I am a regular customer here.   The woman at the front of the assembly line couldn't wait for me to get closer to her to place my order, she starts yelling can I help you over 3 other people.  I ignored her till I got closer and than said what I wanted. I also always ask that they drain the beans, ( I don't like the soggy bottom), so she puts rice and beans in the shell then says, \"Oh, I'm out of shredded chicken.\".  I asked if they had more, she hesitates, but didn't ask anyone and said no.  She tried to get me to go with the grilled chicken which of course costs more. I said no, and repeated my question to whether they had any more of the shredded chicken.   So I told her to forget it and left.     Now I should have called for a manager at that time but hunger and frustration made me not a nice person to deal with at that time.  I got in my car and went to another place to get lunch.  I then decided to call the management and report her.  They put a guy on the phone who sounded like a young kid and claimed he was the manager.  I explained the issue and told him that I felt she should have checked with the kitchen to be sure they were out and then offer me a substitution at no extra charge.   He then informs me that they were temporarily out of the shredded chicken but it was now there.    I was pissed!!  I let him know I was not returning that I had already ate.  He said okay, didn't offer up any discounts and said he would talk to the girl.     Very disappointed with you Cafe Rio.  I am a regular customer and have been for several years.   If this is how you treat those of us who give you steady business, perhaps we should go back to Chipotle Mexican Grill or find another mexican restaurant to frequent.",

Found out later that we were lucky enough to dodge the peak lunch hour line. Holy crap.  I went with the daily special, which was a chicken tostada salad. It was really nice. I picked the pinto beans and gave them the okay to put \"everything\" on it, and it certainly seemed like they did. A tortilla at the bottom of the plate, a whole mess of salad, a solid helping of chicken, a bunch of tostada strips, a gob of sour cream, half of a lime, and the amazing cilantro lime \"vinaigrette\" that was definitely more of a dressing. Everything worked very well together and nothing was bland or overly salty. Oh, and I got a drink with the cost of the special, and I picked the strawberry lemonade with stevia sweetener to save on calories.  I'll definitely come back and try the other specials, and I may look into some of the regular menu items too. This is well worth a visit at non-peak lunch hours.",

I understand not everyone has a good work day but this is the 3rd time I run into this rude individual.   I would ignore it, but I felt I write about it just to better their service.   But the BIGGEST COMPLAINT IS THE FOLLOWING: THEY ARE VERY STINGY! Like you ask for cheese they look at you in a bad way and add just a little bit and then charge you $1 for it!!!!! Wtf? I know it's a charge but for real? Give me what I pay for, a good reasonable amount when I'm not getting any additional toppings.  Ok I'm done talking about this place, go and try it for yourself. In the end, you'll enjoy the grub at this mediocre fast food Mexican restaurant.  Tortillas are fresh and tasty!",

Quesedilla is the size of your head and like an inch thick with meat and cheese.  MUST GET THE MINT LIMEADE. Not too sweet. Love the hints of mint rolling around with the sweet lime.

    "text": "Cafe Rio is pretty good but it's a hit and miss when it comes to their service.  If they are really busy, you can forget about your food being made with care.  When I  go I always order their Sweet Pork Barbacoa burrito, because it contains a hint of sweet and tenderness for pork.  I always like to add lettuce, sour cream and tons of pico to my order as well.  You may also order your burrito enchilada style as well for an additional cost. They have really good  pico de gallo as well.  This time during my visit I added their Queso and Chips option, which was pretty good.  Their queso contained a hint of hot spicyness, that took affect after about 30 seconds of chewing.  Overall, Cafe Rio is a good option should you become bored with Chipolte.",

Cashier: \"Because you got 4oz size.\"  Me: \"so I just said 'yes, house dressing.' I never ordered extra. So your team put it in a larger container and I just have to pay?\" I know it's pennies but made me feel like I was being swindled. Makes it hard to enjoy my dinner.",

Their grilled chicken salad is awesome! So huge and so filling.   The tortillas are all made there in the restaurant. They definitely compliment every meal they are included with.    -and yes the salad is also in a large tortilla.    The service here has always been consistent with a  very friendly staff.  They are helpful and accommodating to your choices and options.     Parking here is a bit cramped in the front and side.  There is always additional parking in back by Total Wine.  But it's obviously easy to find being located right off of Stephanie and Warm Springs.    I'll be back for more very soon!",

    "text": "This place was so much fun! Instead of just waiting in line to place my order, we were able to watch the tortilla making process.   There were two ladies making the tortillas right there in front of us. One mixed the dough, while the other rolled it out and placed it on a spinning flat cook top. Once the tortillas were done, they were then stacked and ready to be used for burritos and quesadillas. Talk about fresh!  We paid an extra dollar for their Fire Grilled Chicken, and got the burrito. My husband loves heat, and asked for the hottest salsa, as well as 'enchilada style' with their green sauce. I love melted cheese and smothered burritos. Yum! They added greens and pico de gallo on the side. We took this home, and my husband and I split it.   The burrito was very flavorful, and large enough for the two of us to share. Even though he asked for the hottest salsa, it was tame enough for me to eat it with no problem...and I am a wimp when it comes to heat. I admit that I had been nervous when he asked for the hot salsa, but I need not have worried. We will definitely be back. Next time, I want to try the horchata as it has been way too many years since I have had any.",

Took one taste of the soup and one bite of enchilada and saying the food was lukewarm is being generous - food was cool. Tried to take back but there were so many people near the register and the staff inattentive. Instead, we just left with the food and drove home to heat it up. Flavor was okay after heating but not great. We're sure the food temperature could not have met health department standards and perhaps it wasn't even safe to reheat but we did. With so many good restaurants, don't waste your money at Cafe Rio.",

Seriously these girls on the line have the worst attitude! Every time I come here the staff pisses me off. They need a lesson in Customer Service, or to be fired. I find all Cafe Rio's line organization is a bit \"out of order and unorganized\", but the attitude you get for asking for something inside your burrito (guac, sc, etc) is as if you asked them to do manual labor. I get it, your getting paid little money and probably have to put up with some BS, but if you don't take pride in your work or learn how to interact in a friendly manner with customers, you will more than likely never advance here or at any job. I am definitely going to call corporate because I feel like someone who gives a shit needs to know how this staff behaves, and it's clearly not the management at this location!",

Okay, let's just take a moment.... you're not selling gold plated quesadillas, and you damn well are not getting your money's worth for how small and ridiculous the portion they give you is! I pay it because we're starving. Get in my car look at the time it's now 12:30. So I spend thirty minutes waiting in a line, when my food took all of two minutes to prepare.  Best part, get home finally get to eat! Only to find a hair in my quesadilla, you know the ones I just spent $29 on?! I'm not too sure how your employees get away with no hair nets and working over open food all day, but considering your prices are ridiculous... at least up your service! Completely disgusted!

You can customize anything to your own personal liking. The tamales were just good. It was enough to get me full. Nothing outstanding. The daily specials come with a drink as well.  Did I like it? Yeah. Solid 4 stars for me. There's three kinds of salsa. The medium have a sweet, tangy taste to it. So I opted for the mild. The flavoring was bland. Next time...I'll definitely try the hot.  Maybe this is a Vegas thing. But personally, I would clump this together with Baja Fresh type-a food.",

When I went in to pick up my order the girl at the take out station had informed me that they had ran out of Tamales and that it would be a 30 minute wait so they could make more. I only have 30 minutes on my lunch break and I had already driven there so I was a bit annoyed. I told them I had just placed my order and they should have informed me before I came there otherwise I would have delayed my order and took my break at a later time.

I always get their burrito bowl with sweet pork barbacoa. The enchilada-style is an extra buck, but I usually pass since it's just extra cheese and the burrito already has enough cheese (plus you can always ask them to go a bit heavier on the cheese if you're feeling cheesy). The line always moves quickly, but if you're really in a rush, you can always call in your order ahead of time before you go pick it up. It is family friendly but it can get fairly loud. Be sure to get their stamp card, you can get a free burrito (with drink!) if you get 10 stamps (1 stamp per entree). Their staff is very friendly and I always enjoy my meal coming out of Cafe Rio.

Really it's the beginning of your lunch rush and no beef ? Only 2 options chicken or pork. Went with the pork. The presentation was great it looks fresh . But the inside including the pork was cold! Bland flavor ! 2 people cost 24.00! Wish I'd gone to Del Taco! Won't go there again !",

The tortilla was so fresh and I am still dreaming about it. The shredded chicken was my favorite while my boyfriend swears by the shredded pork. The creamy  tomatillo salad dressing was full of flavor, but the vinegarette was equally divine. This is a great place for Mexican food without having to sit and wait. However the lines can be really long during lunch and dinner hours so you can call ahead. Also, if you are taking your salad To-Go consider getting your tortilla on the side so it doesn't  get soggy on the ride home.",

The only problems were being rushed. I'd say there were 5 people in front of us. I dont coinsider that a lot, but the way they rushed us through the line, I guess the employees do. I ordered the chicken enchiladas. Delicious but since I was rushed and didnt understand how they organize the line I didnt get all the toppings I wanted. And the enchiladas were served in a foil tray with beans and rice. When I asked for black beans, I didnt realize they weren't going to strain the juice, so I eneded up with kind of a soupy mess that made the enchiladas soggy. But the chicken was really good and the veggies very fresh. I'd give it another go.",

I have been here about 20 times but have still not found a perfect time to come here its always packed and i say they could open another one right next door and it would be just as packed.    Everything is good.  But we have settled on the Pulled chicken Salad as being the best.  Here is how I order it:  Wheat tortilla, Cheese - with both beans no rice (white carbs) pulled chicken.  Shredded lettuce its smaller pieces and every thing else.  Here is the best part ask for the House dressing and the vinaigrette  mixed.  You will not be disappointed and will never be able to go back to just one.    I have had the tamales, Chile relleno, Nacho's, chips and salsa (get the Cheese) the tortilla soup is really good as well.  they also have a nino Quesadillia for the little ones thats free.",

We arrived around 11:15 AM because I had to be at work at noon. We were both going to get the salad with the new spicy green chile pork. They said it was not ready yet, so we ordered the sweet pork barbacoa. They said it was not ready either. So we settled for the shredded chicken. Then, I asked for the spicy sauce on it and they said it was not ready either. At this point I was ready to just turn around and walk out and if I had been by myself I would have, but my mom decided to just stay since we didn't have much time. How do you not have 1/2 your menu ready when you open. and if its not ready, maybe you should at least take care of the customer and compensate for it. I will probably not be going back to this restraunt, and will definitely not recommend it.",

    "text": "One day I was wondering what the big hooplah was over Cafe Rio. Personally, at the time, I was Team Chipotle all the way but my curiosity got to me. So I go in and order the salad.  I ordered the salad with salmon and the house dressing. When I got to my table with the mint limeade, I almost couldn't bear to eat my salad because it looked so pretty with the green romaine lettuce (I requested both chopped and shredded lettuce) pico de gallo, scoop of guacamole, crispy tortilla strips, cilantro and that white cheese they put on top. With the tomatillo cilantro house dressing, it was mighty tasty. And I love their fresh tortillas! That's one thing that's a huge difference from Chipotle. Portion sizes are huge too. I'm always way too full if I finish the whole portion they give me.  During their lunch rush, they are all about speed so don't expect a very warm welcome from their food line, which I can understand. They want to get people in and out asap to make their customers happy because, ultimately, that's all they want: their food. So A for effort there. When they are slower however, the staff is more welcoming. Usually the cashier is very nice. One time I called about missing dressing, told them about the the next time I went and they comped my meal.   I love the selection of drinks and syrups they have to personalize to you tastes. The mint limeade is my favorite but they are all good.   Bravo, Cafe Rio on Stephanie, bravo.",

You stand in line and choose what you want (burrito, taco salad, etc) and you move down the line and tell them what you want in your order.   I really liked my sweet pork taco salad. The meat is basically pulled pork, but with a sweeter sauce. They have more meat options and dessert options than Chipotle or Qdoba.   Cafe Rio is about $2-3 more than what you would pay elsewhere. Until they can beat Qdoba's $6 student meal, they will remain at 4.5 stars =P",

More flavor and better options. I ate here twice during my stay. Both times I got their huge salads. Once with grilled chicken, the other time with grilled steak. Both were flavor full and juicy. The creamy house dressing was one of the best dressings ive ever had. Everything is made right in front of you even the tortillas. The flour tortilla was freshly made and soft, a little too thick. My salad included all basic toppings including a small scoop of guac. For around 9-10$ I got a huge salad. At this price point, I feel the quality and quantity was spot on. Great spot to grab a quick lunch. I will be coming back on my next trip out west.",

We arrived at 425 thinking it would be ready by the time we paid for our meal. After waiting at the pick up area for 5 minutes, we still were not helped. The cashier didn't acknowledge us at all and when she did decide to help us, told us that our food was not ready. She ran our debit card and said it was declined even though we had sufficient funds. After running out to the car to get cash, she said it actually went through.  Now the wait begins. It is now 435 and still no food. We wait another couple of minutes thinking they were going to start making our food and nope still no food. We waiting another 20 minutes and still no food. The cashier kept looking down the line to see if it was being made but never said anything to the workers making the food. She never apologized or anything.  We reminded her several times that we were waiting for our food and still nothing. After waiting another 5 minutes and no attempt for our food to be made we asked to cancel our order of two burritos. She called the manager over who didn't acknowledge us at all, didn't offer us an apology, nothing. He processed our refund and that was the end of it. This was probably one of the worst customer service experiences we have ever experienced. They have lost a loyal customer who has been going there for years.",

She didn't call out for anyone or ask for help just kept getting further and further behind while customer's food was getting cold.  They have about four aluminum bins full of chip strips yet there is a woman in the back frying up and bringing out more instead of helping the customers that are standing in line.  Don't need tortilla strips if you aren't serving any food.  Other employees grilling meat standing by the register or standing around talking.  We stood so long we walked out with our food still pending on the line.",

The line is often long, so a couple times I have called in an order before leaving work with the intent to pick it up on the way home. The first time I thought it was as a fluke that the order wasn't ready more than 30 minutes after I had called it in. However, I now realize it is a pattern. When I came to pick up the order, I waited about 5 minutes at the apparently unmanned counter labeled \"phone pick up orders\" before being acknowledged by the cashier working the main line and asked to come over. He charged me for my order and told me that it would be ready soon. After stepping aside & waiting another 5 minutes, a woman came up and told me that there was no salmon ready and it would be another 15-20 minutes before any was available. Clearly at that point, no one had even looked at the phone order that had been called in a full 40 minutes prior or attempted to get it ready for pick up. This location does not have the ability to consistently offer their full menu, nor the ability to fulfill phone orders dependably.",

When they put the wrong cheese and I asked them to remake it they make it as past as possible and it was horribly made. Then they messed up the meat by rushing. They have horrible customer service and don't care what the customer wants they just want to get your food made as fast as possible.",

Whenever I come here to get some dinner to-go, it's always expected that I will be waiting for a long time before I can even place my order. The way the line wraps around reminds me of the line for Space Mountain at Disneyland. I'm too afraid to order online and pick up because of previous reviews I've read and orders not being correct/items missing. Good looking out, guys!  The only thing I've ever ordered from Cafe Rio is the salad. Cilantro lime rice and black beans on top of a fresh handmade flour tortilla with melted cheese, seasoned shredded chicken breast, lettuce, Cotija cheese, guac, tortilla strips, and dressing. I'm not much of a dressing person, but the house made Cilantro Lime vinaigrette is freaking delicious! It's so flavorful and has the right amount of cilantro in it, just to let you know that it's there. The Creamy Tomatillo dressing is great too. I usually ask for half and half and it's not a problem to get both. The salad is so filling!  During my last visit, the one thing that turned me off was a female employee emptying the old bin of lettuce and putting it on top of the fresh lettuce that she had just replaced it with. It wasn't even the fact that she was emptying it out, it was the fact that the old lettuce was practically submerged in water and dripping everywhere when taken out of the bin. It wasn't too big of a deal, just something I observed.  As far as customer service goes, the employees are nice. It's just that when they get busy during peak hours, it seems to be a bit hectic on the line and everyone is everywhere at once... If that makes sense.  P.S. Yes, the tortillas are as amazing as everyone says!",

I saw from other reviews that people have gotten sick from the place. It also seems to me at times I don't feel well after eating here either, but I almost think it's because of the fiber from the veggies?  The place is usually pretty packed during peak lunch and dinner hours, so be prepared to wait a bit. They also have an app that basically replaced their punch cards - you should get it if you plan to frequent this place.  I'll leave this place at a neutral 3 stars because the food is just \"ok\".

The rice looked kinda yellow with green splotchs of i guess a vegtable. They were out of black beans and they brought out more cut the bag of beans open and poured them in the heating trays, very classy. He scooped a little rice, the a heaping portion of the bagged beans, on top, Then a descent sized portion of meat, the only good thing I will say about my experience there. Then the order taker kept insisting I get the sauce on my burrito I dont like sauce a lot, on or in, my burrito but after three attempts to say no sauce, I gave in and aaid a little on the inside, I got A LITTLE  on the inside and hit me a dollar for my dab of sauce. Now I feel like a sucker. The yellow rice was under cooked, the beans were to many. The order taker made a sloppy wet burrito and backdoored a dollar. The kitchen floor needed to be cleaned. Even the cute girl at the register was rude and to distracted to take the money out of my hand. My first experience will be my last",

I use to be from the Los Angeles area and when I come to vegas to visit friends, I would stop by for a quick bite to eat at Cafe Rio.  My usual location is the one on eastern and the 215.  Now that I live here I was running errands today and decided to stop by because I was near this location.  HORRIBLE IDEA.    #1.  They screw you on portion at this one.  All i had in my burrito was rice and beans and a smidge of meat.  I asked for some extra hot sauce on top since I like spicy food and the person making the dish gave me a dirty look.  I had to ask three times for extra salsa.  #2.  The cashier was unfriendly and didnt care about her job at all.  I came back to order a dessert since my under normal portion burrito was nowhere near satisfying and instead of helping me, all she did was talk to her coworkers about personal matters.  I ordered the tres leches cake and she said \"they are making it fresh right now itll be just a few minutes\"  mind you those exact words so i figure hey that has to be good.  I pay for my dessert and wait about 10 minutes before I go back to the register to see if my dessert is ready.  This time I get to the register the same cashier sees me and ignores me again.  Then her coworkers just cut in front of me and start ordering their lunch and talking to her.  At this point im pretty irritated and just want her attention to tell her forget about my order and give me a refund.  That took another 6-8 minutes of standing there.  I finally get her attention and she just says simply \"oh i forgot about it\".  Continues to talk to her coworkers then after a minute goes and gets the cake.    Remember the part i said she said it was fresh?  WRONG.  she comes out with a piece of cake heavily wrapped in plastic wrap and i keep telling her cancel and refund me.  she ignores (not doesn't hear.  she heard me loud and clear) and continues to prep the cake.  at this point the next cashier comes in and i tell her LOOK I DONT WANT THE CAKE ANYMORE JUST GIVE ME MY MONEY BACK.  cashier takes my credit card and swipes the refund.  no apologies or anything from either the first cashier or second.  I've never had a experience like this at cafe rio, and this will definitely be my last.  The cake that she made they were able to sell to the next customer after me and i looked at it.  I don't claim to know everything about \"mexican\" food and i know cafe rio is a far cry from authentic, but I do know that tres leches should be a moist/wet cake.  Every time I've been to a friends family party (who are hispanic). The tres leches cake is exactly THAT.  This cake looks as dry as can be to where its comparable to angel food cake thats been sitting out for a few days.  To help hide that fact a mountain of whip cream is sprayed on top.   If anyone is actually a regular i suggest going to another store.  this is my first and last time at this store.",

Lady who was making my nacho was not having her day, i hope she would of asked me how much cheese i would like on my nacho but its more like how much chips, meats ect do i want with my cheese, there were more cheese than anything else (if i was a cheese lover then it would have been good). I said no thank you to any beans and she rolled her eyes then I asked for extra guacamole and she scooped half of the scooper and then slammed my plate. I was hoping she would of done the same to my husband but it was a different lady who made his food because if it was the same lady i really would of snapped at her. Anyways we enjoyed our food, shitty lady who took my order and oh she was also rude with the people ahead of us. I wish i could of gotten her name 11/15/16 1pm.",

Sadly when I went there today I couldn't ignore what I witnessed. I almost just walked out as I watched my order being made. The person making my order came from the back wearing gloves but did not put fresh gloves on after coming from the back room then she grabbed a dirty rag and wiped down the area then grabbed a tortilla. Meanwhile another employee is putting lettuce and cheese back into the serving trays that fell out. Lots of sanitary issues going on plus bad customer service continues. I never see a manager supervising any of this. Time to go to a different location.",

    "text": "First discovered Cafe Rio when it was served as a catered lunch at a work training seminar. After I built and and ate my steak taco, I asked where this delicious food was from...it was from the location on Eastern, I later told my wife, \"we must go to there!\".  So glad they opened the location on Stephanie, now I only need to travel down the street to get my fix. Cafe Rio is kinda like In n' Out, there is always a line and it's always busy. Simple menu, fresh ingredients, and hand made tortillas from scratch...that alone should make you wanna go there, for me it's all about the tortillas. And they make them right in front of you...  My favorite is definitely the Pork Barbacoa burrito...sweet porky goodness, rice , black beans, queso fresco and pico wrapped in a fresh, warm tortilla. Muy Bueno! Get it enchilada style, you won't regret it (you might not finish it, but you won't regret it). My second choice would have to be the Fire-grilled Steak, very tender and juicy...get some chips, guac and the mint Limeade, and you're set (unless you decide to go to Yogurt-land next door after all that...,yum).  So, Cafe Rio is fabuloso! The food is delicioso!...okay, I'll stop . Try it, Chipotle's not the only game in town.",

The salads are delicious! They are lined with fresh tortilla and served with a heaping amount of lettuce and a good amount of the protein of your choice. I usually get the sweet pork barbacoa. The salads usually make two meals for me. As far as dressings, the creamy avocado one is the best. If you have kids, they'll give you a complimentary kid sized quesadilla...just ask! Cafe Rio's chicken tortilla soup is pretty good. The horchata is pretty good and so is the minty lemonade. Be on the lookout for coupons in the mail or online.

I get the sweet pork which is the only meat I've tried but can't seem to try anything else because it's so good. I've never really had a problem until today, my friend got the same thing I did, hot sauce on the side, but was not charged for the sauce. I got charged! I thought hot sauce was included (I may be wrong). But shouldn't hot sauce be included? I just wanted it on the side instead.... I guess next time I'll have to have them drizzle it in instead.",

    "text": "I think the food at Cafe Rio has potential, but the service at this location is bad...most of the time. The wait is excessively long and they seem to always be out of queso dip. Most of the crew looks to be more into fun than work. I have never seen a manager here, or at least seen anyone that resembles a manager here. The hardest working people are the ladies making the tortillas. I am not happy with the amount of meat that they give. They seem to do the same thing that Chipotle does, where they scoop or grab a bunch of meat and then scoop or grab some of it right off of your burrito. Somethimes they forget to do that grab the meat off your burrito thing and that makes me happy. Otherwise it is pretty much a not good experience from the beginning ( the excessively long line) to the end (trying to find a clean table and being disappointed in your rice overload burrito).  This location needs some customer service training.   Enjoy, the location on Eastern.",

I said, it said 6:15 online and you have seen me standing here since 6:10...you didn't even start making it until 6:30! She says I can only tell you what the paper says! - I get home, and you guessed it...the salsa is missing from the chips and salsa!

As usual there was a long line during the dinner hours so if you are in a rush, try to avoid going around 5-8 p.m. lol. I got the sweet pork burrito which was pretty good (it's my go to dish). The pork itself has a lot of flavor since it is drenched in sauce. If you are trying to be a little healthier they have a wheat tortilla option.  The portion is nice and they put the lettuce and pico de gallo outside of the burrito which was kind of weird at first. I usually get cilantro as well. It's worth trying this place out if you haven't been yet and are tired of going to Chipotle. I do have to say that their chips and guacamole pale in comparison to Chipotle in terms of flavor.",

This was the break in the chain ... she was suppose to be the one the put on all the toppings. Biggest concern was that nobody was managing the situation.   The phone was ringing off the hook , none of the employees were greeting , smiling or making eye contact! There was plenty of staff just no direction .   The score could have been higher if they at least apologized for the wait ! Overall a very poor experience and would probably go back but management needs to revisit the process and focus on what good looks like !!",

My mouth is drooling just thinking about their homemade flour tortillas, made fresh right in front of your eyes *dying*...and with me being a picky eater I love how you can see the food being prepared in front of me; that way I know what I am getting and I know it's made accurately.   The chile roasted beef is to die for. It tastes like a pot roast that has been slow-cooking all day at Grandma's house. Just add in some cheese, veggies and a side of pico and you have yourself heaven in a aluminum takeaway container (which is awesome by the way). If you can't finish your dish just throw on a lid and you're good to go.   I recently ordered the queso dip and it was stellar, their chips are delish and I'd have to say my favorite dish are the tacos right now. Oh and get this - order any adult entree and get a free kids quesadilla for your little munchkin. Say what? That's right....FREE food. How awesome is that?  It does get super busy here and that's my only gripe....but hey, they're serving awesome food, can you blame them? No. Soooo much better than Chipotle.

    "text": "I have to say that I dont understand the interest in this place. Went with a friend who described it as her favorite Mexican restaurant. I love my friends, but I would say that calling this place a Mexican restaurant is a stretch.   First, the atmosphere was horrible. Like Chipotle, you wait in a cattle line with a ton of other people and have questions screamed at you over the loud kitchen noise. \"MEAT?\" \"CHEESE?\" \"MILD, MEDIUM, HOT?\". Then you are shuffled into a loud, busy seating area. I just did not find any of this enjoyable.   Second, the food. I would have to say the popular sweet pork is one of the worst things I have ever tasted. It is WAY too sugary. I guess it is designed for an American palate, but I have never tasted anything like that at a True Mexican restaurant.",

We finally got through I kept it simple we got the steak burrito with rice and black beans inside asked for mild on the side that I didn't get but we orders chips and salsa and a small drink.

The first two people in line were fine, the third was terrible. She had the worst attitude while preparing our food. when I asked for a side of sauce she acknowledged my request then proceeded to help the next person behind me after she pushed our food down the line. I had to ask again as she was starting to help the next person. She gives me the colossal size of the side (which I didn't want because they are so over priced). We get to the end and two burritos are $23 and the lady rings me up for a large side even though I didn't want it but it's whatever at this point. The portions were small for how much it cost and the burrito was soupy. I can't stand the amount of lettuce they put on the side(instead of putting it in the burrito?) as if I am feeding a small herd of rabbits but I guess that's Cafe Rio's style. I get better portions going to Zaba's, Chipotle, and Qdoba all for a cheaper price too.  I'm probably never going back to Cafe Rio their food and prices are definitely not worth it.",

I especially love that they hand-make all of their tortillas (you can watch through a window while you stand in line to order) and they have a HUGE selection of hot sauce in a little shelf unit by the knives, forks, and napkins. The only thing I am not crazy about is that the burritos only have cheese, rice, meat and beans wrapped inside, and everything else (lettuce, guac, sour cream, pico de gallo) is on the side, which forces you to eat the burrito with a knife and fork instead of holding it wrapped up in your hands. They do offer enchilada-style burritos which is pretty awesome. Solid mexican food restaurant that I will definitely return to.",

Actually, you get a FREE kids quesadilla for all kids under 6 years old with an adult purchase.  Today I went with chicken enchiladas with MEDIUM sauce.   Lunch time on a Saturday meant very long lines but it moves pretty fast.  I give Cafe Rio the 5th star because of their drink options.  In addition to the soda machine, they offer 3 types of freshly-brewed iced tea and 4 types of Mexican-flavored drinks (orchata, mint lemonade, etc.).  The fire-grilled chicken and carne asada are both great.  I haven't tried the barbacoa - but it's their most popular meat item I think.    All in all, Cafe Rio offers up quality made-to-order food - did I say HOMEMADE tortillas made in front of you?   There are very few Mexican restaurants in town that offer the same quality of food for the price.  My family of 3 can eat here for $20 or less - which is actually very hard to do in this town at any restaurant.  And the food always meets our expectations!!",

The staff is fast and friendly. The menu takes a little getting used too, but the staff are helpful.  We ordered a sweet pork barbacoa enchilada plate and a sweet pork barbacoa burrito plate. Both with mild sauce. The food was delicious. It was hard to stop eating my burrito even after I knew I had eaten too much. The burrito plate is large and could feed two people (maybe).

    "text": "Cafe Rio is my favorite little fast - food Mexican restaurant. They have a cute \"Mexican styled\" restaurant and you can almost always count on friendly employees. A+ customer service is definitely something they aim for. They will often ask to take your tray or bring you something (eg. dressing, tortillas, or anything not quite ready at the moment). Around lunch time Cafe Rio hits their \"rush hour\" and although there are plenty of seating both inside and outside you may have a little trouble finding a seat for you and your friends! Another thing to be expected around lunch time is the lines are longer than usual, but the wait is worth it if you ask me.  The delicious, fresh, fairly cheap food is always something I look forward to eating with a few friends after class or a long day of shopping. Contrary to the good, the meat is a little sweet for some peoples liking which is why some people prefer Chipotle over Cafe Rio, but the sweet meat is giving their food their own style. I'm a vegetarian, so I don't have to worry about this. Go me!  You can find Cafe Rio restaurants all over the valley. This makes it easy to get a quick, filling meal no matter where you are. It's kind of like McDonalds... But fresh and actually taste good! Plus, they cater! My family uses the catering services they offer all the time for anything from baby showers to Super Bowl parties.  I would of course recommend Cafe Rio to anyone. More specifically a salad with house dressing and shredded lettuce, rather than the big pieces, this makes it easier to eat. I say give it a try. You don't have much to lose. Cafe Rio is trendy and cheap. Worst case, you don't like it and you're only out a few dollars.",

It was sweet and kind of sugary. I really liked it and would get it again. The tacos come with lettuce, cilantro and pico de gallo with a side of rice and beans.   They rush you through the line a little. They didn't offer cheese or sour cream, just asked if I wanted lettuce and pico. Probably a good thing though because I would've added those at it wouldn't have worked with the taste of the meat.",

Expensive for garbage! trust me don't go here! to top it of, there is no salsa bar. it's a bunch of salsas in a bottle u can get a grocery store. will never go to this place again. I don't even know how they can consider themselves a Mexican restaurant! they have alot of learning to do. trust me, skip this place. If you are looking for good mexican food go to taco y taco  ( in the shopping center of tropicana and pecos ) or El Panzon tacos y tortas ( in the shopping center on  sunset  and sand mill ).",

So I got the pork Nachos and my Husband wanted a Bean and Cheese burrito with rice and ended up with just the Bean and Cheese. But the food was very good. The staff seemed ok kinda talking amongst each other but, they did aknowledge us also. We will be back",

I guess a long time. I waited in front of the pick up desk for 45 minutes. I asked twice about my food. And finally it got done as my child had a break down on the floor. Mind you this is an hour and 15 mins after we actually ordered.... 2 burritos.... and as others got their food and ate and left... I'm not one to say anything but after the whole wait one of the employees (not a manager- so unprofessional ) gave me a free meal card.... which I still have to buy a meal to get a free meal.... what??! The food is good. A standard for cafe rio. But not hour- and -15 min -wait- toddler -freak -out good. I will not be going back to this location.",

    "text": "I'm a pretty regular Chipotle eater and can totally appreciate the assembly line style of choosing exactly what you want in your meal, and after hearing a recommendation from someone who prefers Cafe Rio, I figured sure, I'll give it a shot. The seats and tables were the first thing I noticed since they're brightly colored and spattered with paint, but after that I realized I came to eat and not to stare at furniture, so I moved on to the menu, which was about as straightforward and simple as could be.  I got a burrito, mainly since the tortillas looked amazing, with chicken, black beans, rice, etc. It's boring, but pretty much exactly what I get at Chipotle, and I wanted to compare. The sad part came when I got to the register, as it came to $10 and change without any of the additional options and a basic drink. Not bad if considering it as restaurant quality food, but as standard higher-end fast food, it gets into some dicey territory as far as price goes.   The drink area was surprisingly great, with a tons of choices and additional in-house teas, limeades, and even horchata. The burrito was great too. It was hot, the chicken was flavorful, and the tortilla turned out to taste as good as it looked.   The girlfriend on the other hand wasn't impressed. She got the two taco plate with beef, which was the same price, and I wouldn't be mentioning it if I didn't agree with her; the beef tacos were on a completely different level as the burrito. The tin foil they came in was full of grease, and the tacos were soaked in it. They were soggy and bland. Some grease is to be expected with beef, but this was a little overwhelming, and turned the tacos into a big wet glob of food. It would've been worth it if the beef had some substantial flavor, but they didn't.  Ultimately, the glory of the chicken burrito was not completely overshadowed by the greasy beef, although the tacos were admittedly bad. Would I pick it over a Chipotle burrito? Probably not. It was hotter and tasted great, but was also a bit smaller, more expensive, and more sloppily thrown together than what I get at Chipotle, with less topping options too. Definitely a decent place for some quick, fresh Mexican food, but I'm staying far away from the beef.",

    "text": "cafe rio is pretty good. I haven't really had a bad meal there, been there quite a few times already.  the food always taste fresh. I typically get the 2 tacos with the sweet pork and grilled chicken. pretty good.  the quesadilla is delicious also.  cafe rio has kind of perfected the assembly line style of fast Americanized Mexican food.  there is one problem, and it's a major one there. every single time I order food and step to the left to finalize the food options and pay, there is always a issue at the cashier. the problem is that the workers on the food line are lining up the meals in order of the customer. but if you have a quesadilla or something still on the grill, that kind of gets left behind or off to the side, so you have to go over the order with the cashier and one or two things are missing. if you want to add something like chips and guac or salsa on the side, the last worker is already on another order and has to back pedal to complete mine. it's always at the cashier you feel rushed and there is a problem.  they need to either slow down on the processing of the orders to make sure they aren't overlapping other orders, letting the cashier complete the order correctly or they need to figure out another system at that moment when your suppose to pay.  the issue I see is, the cashier has to verify what the customer is having, put it in the bag and make sure it's correct, but like I mentioned earlier if you have something on the grill, and it's finished that just gets placed on the side or on the view of where they are preparing the meal but it never finds it way to the end until your already there going over the order, and by that time another order and another order are stacking up.  they try to do a subway style system, or what freebirds or chipotle do. but right at that cashier spot they just fail.  ill be going back for sure...hopefully one day they'll figure out how to streamline that last step there.",

It left us comfortably full and satisfied. My friend, who is visiting from Hawaii, said she will definitely tell her family (who lives in Henderson) about this place!

So I got the chicken that wasn't shredded just because I didn't want to wait 10mins. It was a super long day, running errands, and I RARELY ever eat out or get take out, like I didn't eat out one time in at least a month. Then the manager I'm guessing gave me a free meal as well as the regular chicken since I didn't want to wait 10 more mins for more to be cooked. I thought that was nice. Especially since shredded chicken is my fav, I think it has more flavor then the other chicken which is more expensive. N after a long day of running errands around town, 10mins feels like a hour. Lol like I just wanna go home all ready! Good customer service. I really like cafe rio anyway.. there food sometimes there lines are a pain. Which is why I always order on the app. They should really fix the app though, I tried to order on the app, and it kept asking me to log in to make a order, even tho I was already logged in. And then it kept going to the beginning and I'd have to put in my order all over again..  did that like 3x then just ordered as a guest and paid at the store, & swiped my rewards card at the store.",

I will say all of the trash cans were overflowing and tables definitely needed to be wiped down but other than that, this location is quite a nice spot to sit down and eat in.

    "text": "There seems to be an unusual amount of negative reviews for this location. One thing I always look for on yelp reviews is whether or not ownership/management responds to both the positive and the negative. When there is absolutely nothing - as is the case with this particular location (Stephanie in Henderson) it reflects on the business and can confirm the bad reports. I work at a nearby business and my lunch times are written in stone. For this reason I avoid going to places I know will be busy during the typical lunch hour. On Tuesday I went in after 1:30 PM. Big line. That's usually a sign the place is popular - which Cafe Rio is. But in this instance it was because of understaffing. When I finally got to the register to pay for my takeout a cashier didn't show up for at least 8 minutes. There were two folks ahead of me and they were getting visibly frustrated. Numerous employees at numerous times passed right by us and none of them communicate anything at all. No \"sorry, about the wait, someone will be right with you\" - no acknowledgment of any kind. When a cashier finally appeared to take my nearly $20(!) for a pork quesadilla, chips with salsa and guacamole she seemed miserable. No eye contact, no comment about the wait, no 'thank-you\" no confirmation or contact at all. A big chunk of my lunch time was over (lines I can deal with - but not when it's due to understaffing. A little communication of any kind would have lowered the frustration level). When I got back to work with minutes to spare to eat -- my food was cool to the touch (almost 10 minutes sitting at the register), there was no salsa for my chips and no sour cream (for which I had asked to be put on my quesadilla).  And to top it all off, I phoned the store and was put on hold before I had a chance to say anything and, after five minutes of being on hold, I had to hang up and get back to work. Additionally, I responded to the survey offer on my receipt -- and communicated with the link on the Cafe Rio website - asked to be contacted about my comments - and have yet to hear anything. The place where I work has a staff of nearly 100 and we come face-to-face with over a thousand customers (and potential Cafe Rio customers) on a daily basis. \"Word-of-Mouth\" is the most powerful advertising tool there is.",

I ordered my food and everything felt so rushed that I had to hurry up and couldn't see what I really wanted so that was a negative. And there's a bunch on teens working the line and look angry. I live right down the st and right when I got home me and my fiance's tacos and nachos were soggy. I was so irritated because my tacos were actually delicious. I couldn't even pick my taco up, that's how soggy they were. You basically have to sit there and eat it.",

    "text": "I've been living in this area for more than a decade now and I'm proud to called it my neighborhood . I'm very proud of the progress that we've made with all of our new and renovated restaurants it just shows our economy is doing great and it helps our community. I've noticed in the last few months though that cafe rio its dropping the ball in the customer service area I'm not sure who does the hiring there but , it's important for management in all of our neighborhood restaurants to know that employees as well as employers hold a very important role in a reputable business as to the uniform standards and business behavior . Today, I went to cafe rio and it was unusually dead not more that 4 cars parked outside as I was walking in I felt the ambiance somewhat stiff, restaurant had no music background , it just looked and felt like there was an \"elephant in the room\" as I approached the counter I find to my surprise and shock behind the register a gentleman with huge fake eyelashes bright red lipstick and noticeable earrings , before I could finish my facial reaction of what the...? He, pointed me to place my order at the food line where there was another gentleman who started to make my order with a very relax (rude) attitude especially when I asked for chopped cilantro only because they serve cilantro with roots and all and I don't eat cilantro roots , he immediately turn to the gentleman with what I feel was a custom of a female cashier and asked if it was ok to chopped the cilantro, when suddenly a cook from the back approached and said \"we have chopped cilantro in the back!\" Which is when the one making my food shouted back \" hey! Don't scream at me!, I'm sensitive!\" I was like, what happened to once upon a time a beautiful, well organized and profesional cafe rio Uhm... maybe that is why there's only 4 tables on a beautiful sunny Sunday.  I then proceeded to walk towards the register and  in my head, I was like, should I say ma'am or sir ?  Anyhow I asked for a courtesy cup and and was giving a \"you mean water cup!!\" And I said yes. Overall I had a very uncomfortable experience. Again, it didn't reflect the outstanding job most of our community restaurants hold up.  I hope I don't offend anyone with my experience.",

I went with the enchilada and their new spicy green chile pork, no beans, rice, and a side of their house guac sauce ($1 extra). It was good, but could be better. Their rice was borderline crunchy, and the meat was too sweet for my taste. Of course I wasn't expecting anything authentic, but I was decently satisfied. I guess if you live in Nevada, gotta do what the Nevadians do lol",

If you watch your emails, they have 2x, 3x and even 4x points days which basically give you a free meals worth of points.

Only downside is that late in the evening, got run into the possibility of them being out of your Choice of meat or tortilla. Lol, yes I said tortilla.",

The dining area is very colorful and spacious.The kitchen is open so you can see the food being prepared when you order it. The highlight was seeing the tortillas being made and cooked right in front of me. So fresh and airy.  My problem was not with the kitchen or the food being prepared but with the employees. They seemed overly sweaty and their shirts were very dirty.. Then there was the cashier whose black shirt was covered in white hair- I am an animal owner so I would bet my money that it was her cats or dogs hair. After seeing that, I had lost my appetite.  I ate my 2 salmon tacos with sides of rice and beans. My food was tasty, fresh, and filling, but it was hard to enjoy.",

So I left for work an hour early to wait in line , after 25 minutes of waiting I get up to order and I order what I always get \"shredded chicken and rice and black beans\" and the girl just stared at me and after a minute of staring she says \"we have no chicken\" so I asked why they didn't put up a sign to let people know and I asked how long it would be and she asked someone behind her and they said they didn't have any at all . So I ordered something else . Went on down the line . The staff after was very rude . And when I went to pay I told the lady at the register about it and she was sweet and got a manager for me , as the manager came out I told him I had worked in food services for 8 years , and he said word for word \"that has nothing to do with me , what do you want from me\" . I literally was so mad I just walked out . Literally the worse customer service I have ever had , and I am going to contact corporate about this incident . It was absolutely awful .",

Cafe Rio also has a stamp card (if you don't have one, ask the cashier for one) which for every entree you order you earn a stamp and after ten stamps you earn a free meal (plus drink).  Cafe Rio is definitely worth looking into; and if you're a burrito fan, enchilada style is a must!",

Sure, the line can get pretty long, but you are watching your tortilla and basically your whole meal, be assembled right in front of you. Their employees have been fast and friendly. They should offer a class during non business hours to learn how to make tortillas. Their chicken is juicy (I always order a chicken quesadilla), their beans and rice fresh and flavorful. Thumbs up to their Horchata too, my all time favorite.  Tip: To save time, you can order and pay ahead, as they have a separate to go/call in line available.   Their kids free cheese quesadilla is the perfect size for littler guys. Ole!",

The good thing is that both Henderson locations are consistent:  loud and busy but service is efficient and food tastes the same at both places.    I'm just not into their meat being super soggy with cooking liquids dumped right into your aluminum container.  Very disappointing to have your nachos turn into a soggy clump because of the liquids in the meat.  I don't like the hot liquid wilting my salad either.    I do like that they actually have \"salad lettuce\" rather than just shredded \"garnish lettuce\".  But it's not enough for me to give them another chance.  Sorry Cafe Rio, I'll keep going to Chipotle even though their \"salad\" consists of thinly sliced lettuce.",

That was fine as I was not in a huge hurry. As I was waiting I was also notified that there was no chicken and that I had to choose another type of meat. Again, not a big deal. What was most frustrating was that they brought the food out and were such in a hurry that they did not go through the order and I did not realize until I was all the way home. When I called to bring it to their attention, the cashiers argued that they made sure to bring it out on time. When I tried to speak with the manager I was kept of hold for more than 10 minutes. I completed a survey and asked that I be contacted and no one called. I guess one customer isn't a big deal to lose.",

You HAVE to tell them you want that extra taco \"a la carte\" or they will NOT get it right. They will also miss topping additions you ask for. They are definitely rushing to clear out the line and they miss things because of it. You really have to tell them multiple times what you want.   They also call their salsa verde something else which I ALWAYS forget! And if you don't ask for it in that name, they say they don't have it. Even though it is right there. In front of their face.

Which is a a good thing because the shredded chicken can leave the salad a little wet. Also, no matter what you order, get the house dressing! It's this mildly spice cilantro ranch concoction that's insanely addicting. The food is big and I always have leftovers. My Bf on the other hand killed his salad in under 10 minutes.

    "text": "Cafe Rio used to be one of my favorites, but this location seems to have a plethora of problems. First and foremost they rush you through the line as fast as possible, slapping your food together like it owes them money. The employees do not pay attention to what you ask for, and throw whatever they like onto your requested item of food, which is bad customer service - and really, really annoying. I requested a chicken salad with black beans - no rice - shredded lettuce. What I got was a pile of beef on a tin with iceberg lettuce. When I tried to correct the order, I received huffs and gruff from the female employee and food thrown back into its receptacles. Wow.  The place is packed - every day. There seems to be no reprieve, and they have run out of items completely at least three times that I have been there. Any time I have ordered takeout, the order has been incorrect, items left out, and one time I even received someone else's order which I had to drive all the way back to the Restaraunt! Waste of gas, time, and money.  I probably won't go to this location again. It just seems as though the high school employees behind the counter couldn't care less about anything, including the cleanliness of the dining area. Not to mention the complete lack of customer service.",

With this said, the concept is like Chipotle - you select either a burrito, bowl, salad, tacos, etc. you select which meat, what toppings like cheese, lettuce, beans, rice AND more!   The carne asada is delish! It's juicy and tender. The shredded pork barbacoa has a sweet after taste, it's actually kinda good.  You have to try the cilantro-ranch- like dressing! It's refreshing and it's too overbearing with the cilantro after taste!",

I will most likely never go back to any of their chain restaurants as the management seems to have no care for their quality control.  The cleanliness and attention to detail about the restaurants bathrooms speaks about how much the people working actually care about their restaurants.  You can see from the pictures that nobody here gives a care about their work environment. Take pride in where you work or get out.",

They gave me everything she ordered. Line cook said they'll take care of all the sides since it was a error. Get to the register. I now have all of her sides while she had just my order \"tacos\"The cashier throws everything out that I did not order. What a waste. I let her know that I still would of ate that. Just don't charge me.  Couldn't believe it. The tacos were screwed up as well but didn't wanna go back in line. Cashier says, I'm sorry but I didn't do it...

On one occasion here my 4 year old had her finger pinched inside the hinge side of the door.  Not one person from the restaurant made any effort to see if we were okay.  I can remember my time in service industry and if someone was hurt or had something go wrong even if it were not our fault or fault of the company we did everything we could to turn years into a smile and memory.  It's small things that keep people coming back, I didn't need a free meal or drink, but just a word or a baggie for ice for her hand would have been a nice touch.    Honestly in Henderson/Las Vegas I am not impressed by Cafe Rio at all.  The food is like I said decent, customer service at most locations is lacking, the bathrooms at the 3 closest ones to my residence are not clean, and rarely stocked with soap and paper towels.    The one saving grace is the free kids Nino Quesadilla,  my 4 that are 5 and under like them, and fill them up enough.  This being the reason that got as high of a star rating as a 3 other wise I say they might be a mid to low 2 star.",

So I showed up 15 minutes early and the guy working the register was annoyed that I showed up early and told me he \"just received me order\". I proceeded to wait the 15 minutes. Still no food. They don't have black beans, they also don't have shredded lettuce? What does that even mean? Shred the lettuce you have? Just very disappointed with this location. Still sitting here 30 minutes later and they haven't even started making my food. Punishment maybe for being early?  I am now sitting in my car with no cafe rio bc the man chose to wait 30 minutes to tell me they are out of pork.. the reason I came here. THANK YOU FOR WAISTING MY TIME",

    "text": "This was ONE of my Very first fast food Mexican Grills that I'd ever had once I moved to Vegas. When I first started becoming a frequent customer the staff was always bubbly and pleasant to interact with. I started seeing a MaJor transition with the staff at this location about 5 or 6 months ago. The staff had more of a morbid and \"I Don't Give Two F....\" type of attitude. I never complained because, we All have bad or terrible days. I guess I should've started complaining then things could've been much better than my most recent experiences. I was at the Stephanie and Henderson location yesterday, went inside wasn't greeted until I walked up to be serviced. Mind you, the food isn't cheap like going to McDonald's or Burger King. So you'd hope that Everything would be giving and delivered with a 100% mindset or mentality. I placed my order had to beg the first server for a tad bit more meat. She wanted to charge me for this but I said, \"Can I have just a morsel added?\" Not trying to be charged for 2-4 extra pieces of grilled chicken in my salad. So I continued going down the serving line, and this young man didn't have his area covered with the lettuce, sour cream, etc. Nothing in this young man's area looked sanitary, but I Loved eating here, and the salads weren't half bad. I got to the cashier she told me my price, and why it was almost $10. I agreed to pay that price only because I was famished. Go to look for a seat, a majority of the tables are always dirty so I was accustomed to the restaurant area looking unkept. I sit down get some ice in my cup, and my utensils. Open up my container lid, I did order my food to go by the way. Just wanted to put a few bites in my mouth before I got back on the road. I pray First and Foremost just my upbringing, I'm so damn glad this is imbedded in me. I go to look and move my salad around and I see a fly that has and carries all types of bacteria and diseases lying still in the lettuce. I almost THREW UP from seeing this. I immediately took my salad back up to the cashier requesting a few gift cards, and my money back!! I was disgusted, who wants to eat flies or any types of foreign objects that they haven't asked for to be added in there meals? This place does need to be looked into with the Health Department to make sure this place and all of there sister restaurants are up to par. I honestly have been thinking back on How many times I've eating here, and the other locations. Have I eating bugs before? Has Any One else eating bugs and didn't know or notice it because that's not what a customer goes to a restaurant for. Inspect your food!! At this point I don't want Any gift cards, they didn't have any to offer any way when I was there. And this little young adult couldn't have been any more than 22 years young. Approached me saying, \"We don't have any gift cards.\" But whenever you come back we'll give you a free meal. Any one running an establishment knows, to reassure a customers satisfaction after finding a fly that defecates on food whenever it lands on anything perishable or not, causes contamination. This young adult had No knowledge of what was to come from this interaction with me. I should've been offered as an incentive 3 to 4 months of free meals any time I made my presence known. I had to put this on Yelp, it's the principles of how people Neglect making things right when they've F'd up all around. Definitely needs to be closed down to REALLY clean this establishment. Where flies roam this means there's excess filth around. If they'd utilize the lid covers for all the food areas, also keep the trash cans below overflowing, wiping the tables, keeping the floors swept, mopped, and not become acclimated to doing whatever seems easier for them, I wouldn't be writing this 3-4 paragraph horribly disgusting experience to my Yelp reviews.",

    "text": "The food was on point but like others have said below, the problem is the staff, management and organization.    Here's what happened to us last night:  We placed an order online and were quoted 7:00 pm as our pick up time.   We ordered online because we always end up taking half of our food home with us and because we have two boys ages 2 and 4 so timing is crucial and waiting is a disaster.   Got there at 7:05 pm exactly and told the To Go cashier that we are here and asked if it would be more than 5 minutes because if so, I would have my husband take the kids for a little walk.  She says: I'm sending your order to the front of the line right now and it will be ready in roughly 5 min. I say: perfect.  Little did I know that we would not receive our order until 7:35 pm due to some communication problems between the new to go cashier and the guy that preps the food and helps with to go orders. I have no idea what the real problem was because I was too busy trying to help my husband keep our kids mellow while waiting 30 minutes in a crowded restaurant with no food.   It would have been much faster if I had waited in the line and ordered in person.  The worst part was that I went back to the to go area to see what was going on multiple times and was consistently given the message that it was right there and would be right up.   The food was below the standard and made with so much sour cream it was ridiculous but I guess we were able to choke it down because its hard to find anything wrong with Cafe Rio's sweet pork.   I didn't yell or even have a chance to express my frustration because as I'm sure you can imagine, the kids required most of our attention and honestly I didn't see anyone that looked over the age of 18 working at that time so I didn't think that would really make me feel any better.  Obviously the management is the problem bc the whole to go ordering process is a train wreck.   Here's my hope:   A) Cafe Rio-- GET BETTER  B) Notice the trend in recent POOR reviews and take action by contacting each person and inviting them back for a more enjoyable experience on the house C) Don't make my family stop eating the most delish sweet pork in the world because your service sucks.  D) GET BETTER   Gracias.",

And this place is EFFIN' expensive to boot! $23 and change for two burritos and 1 small drink. And it's nasty! Woooowee! I'm mad about this nasty expensive food. The burrito taste like it was vegetarian. What happened to my CHICKEN!!!  I could have gone to a roach coach and gotten better tasting, wayyyy cheaper food. The Horchata didn't even taste right!

Their menu is something new to me so I had to just stand there for a bit and decide what to try......*drum roll* it was decided, grilled chicken salad!   What amazed me at Cafe Rio is that they make all their tortillas Fresh!  I have never been to a fast food chain where tortillas are made fresh!  And boooyyy are those fresh tortillas delicious!    This salad is made with the tortilla as the base, topped with some chopped lettuce, pico de gallo, guacamole, grilled chicken, and other garnishes, and you have a choice between a creamy dressing or an oil based dressing.  I'm not a fan of creamy dressings, so I tried the lime cilantro oil dressing and it hit the spot!    This place is very delicious and fresh!  For those of you who have not tried it yet, it is a must!    Now onto my next opinion, although Cafe Rio is good, it is so different from Chipotle and yes, Chipotle still is on my list of favorite places to go to eat!",

The enchilada was missing the guacamole as the girl doing the assembly wasn't paying any attention to what the customers wanted. The burrito was good, the beef is tasty and nice and tender.

I prefer something like the nacho burrito from Baja Fresh which has all sorts of good things in the burrito as well as enough meat.  A lot of people seem to love this place b/c it's always jam packed, but I don't see why it's considered so much better than anywhere else that sells the same types of food.

They have an insane line and it would better suit you to wait in your car, call and order take-out, and then walk in 10 minutes later to purchase and avoid the line. My fave is the sweet pork burrito. Always a winner.",

Horizon Ridge and it was really close to my house. I have used this location several times. Tonight I have reached my final visit to that location. On 3 separate visits they have ran  out tortillas, Shredded chicken,  beans and tonight salad dressing. We waited in line for at least 1 hour. At other location that I have been to in Henderson. There is no problem with the line. You wait but the line keeps moving. This location the staff is never prepared. I complained tonight 11/14 between 6 and 7 pm.  I asked for A Manager and this unproffesicsl Girl said that's how it was left to her. And then just walked away.  I then said I will change my order that is ridiculous you have no dressing. I just waited for a hour. The girl at the second prep area  just rolls her eyes. After I lost my patience,  cause nobody in there really cares. It's Dinner time on a Friday Night and you are unprepared AGAIN and out of food.  At that moment a burrito gets thrown on the counter.. The Cashier could care less either..I'm Done... I tell my kids let's go. I said I will no longer use this location. I will drive farther just so I don't have to visit this store. I have never had a problem with the 509 N Stephanie Location.",

    "text": "Oh man oh man, I'm a big fan of Cafe Rio.  No bigger fan.  Well, maybe, but I'm a pretty huge fan LOL.  I like the new location.  It's in a small detached building in a huge strip mall.  There's ample parking and lots of big windows.  The place is big and has a lot of seating.  I like the bright colors and the different shaped table tops.  The place is clean and flows very well for me.  Although it's getting colder, I do appreciate the outside seating option as well.    I've been to that new location twice in one week because A.) it's closer to my apartment and B.) it's worth every cent.  Their pork barbacoa is just something else!  I always get the pork barbacoa salad for around  $8.  It's huge!  Start with a homemade tortilla, lined on the bottom of a tin container.  The tortilla is heated up on the flat top with melted cheese.  You then pick between two kinds of beans and rice.  Then comes the pork.  A nice heaping tongful of this magical meat.  Sounds weird but I have dreams about it.  After that, they load the container with lettuce (I prefer the shreaded lettuce because it means more lettuce and less unused space), cilantro, crispy tortilla strips and a scoop of guacamole.  For the dressing, I prefer the vinaigrette.  Let me just tell you.  I feel as if you don't need dressing.  The barbacoa part of the pork is sweet and just a little tangy.  The black beans and rice really compliment the entire dish and mixed with everything else, you've really got a fulfilling combination.    I could literally go blue in the face, telling you how much I love it there, but you need to try it for yourself.  This place has got it going on!  I beg you all to get in your cars and visit Cafe Rio for the pork barbacoa.  You will NOT be disappointed :) oh and you're welcome in advance...",

There are many different combinations of items you can get from burritos, enchiladas, salads, tacos, all the usual mexican favorites.   I usually go with a salad or tostada. The house dressing is a creamy tomatillo that is totally addicting. They also have some of the best nachos I've ever had. Completely covered in cheese and then piled with beans, sour cream and guac. Mmmmmm. I also get the salsa fresca which I could just drink!   Don't forget dessert. The coconut flan and tres leches are awesome. They top them with whipped cream and strawberries, are you hungry yet??  They also have a large drink bar with sodas, horchata and the famous mint limeade. The food and service is almost always consistent. Try to avoid the lunch hour (1200-1) but even then they get you through pretty quickly.",

But even with having the price slashed in half it was still more expensive than chipole and didn't taste as good.   The staff is super fast, they're like hovering with the sauces they think you'll get so you kind of get anxiety that they'll put it on. You have to practically shout at them to \"no, the spicy one\" or they'll put the wrong one. They're driven by quantity not quality.   What we got: 1. Chicken burrito: comes with rice, black beans, cheese and your choice of sauce. I asked for the spicy one and it was not spice at all. Maybe 2/10. Tasted mild at best. Then had more hot sauce placed in it. It's served with the lettuce and salsa next to it. 7.79ish, but extra dollar for sauce to cover it. Not worth it.  2. Steak burrito: again rice black beans, cheese and spicy sauce toasted. With more hot sauce covering it. With salad next to it. 7.79+1.5 cause it's sliced steak (confusing, I don't get it) +1 dollar for sauce to cover it. Again not worth it",

I was so excited to try Cafe Rio but their service is sooooo bad. No one smiles. No one welcomes you. Once you step on the line they're bothered you even entered to eat there. They don't care if they drown your burrito with salsa or if they even get your order right. I really hate this place and I'm never coming again. I'm never bringing my family here or recommending this place to anyone.",

I requested cheese and she advised there is already cheese on the tortilla.  Then proceeded to placed  lettuce on top of the meat and when get upset when i asked for the shredded lettuce, she removed the normal lettuce along with half of the meat.  I asked again for cheese and was advised there will be an extra charge, which was fine but i have never been told that before or charged. I do not get the dressing or other condiments and moved onto the register.  It is one thing to wait in line for a custom made meal but to have an employee give an attitude to a customers requests with other employees and customers watching is not an experience i want to go thru again.",

We ordered a chicken burrito that was SLOP! The tortilla was so soggy, it was disgusting! Then, I ordered and paid for 2 sides of guacamole and received only one. Also, ordered a side of sour cream, didn't get that either!! Oh and the two Fresca's I ordered didn't come in the bag. If people would read the ticket, things like this wouldn't happen. It was simple and in black and white. Just read it!! To top it off, my daughter picked it up and was treated very rudely. She's younger and wasn't even handed the drink we bought. This was a complete waste of my money and time!",

I'd like to keep going, as it's very close to my office and good lunch places are in rare supply around, but I think I'll probably abstain for awhile. Hopefully they'll get back on track, as the tortillas are awesome and the sweet pork is ridiculously good.",

I get hiring young people, but YOU HAVE TO PROVIDE SOME TRAINING or at least hire people who have the mental capacity to get an order right... the show \"Are You Smarter Than a Third Grader?\" comes to mind.  After multiple times of ordering from here and being frustrated by the order being messed up, lost, or something else crazy like they are out of \"rice, beans and tortillas\" (True story), I was craving their Queso dip and decided to order from them again... bad idea. My husband showed up and they had two orders for him and neither was right. Then, we bring the food home and everything is cold and messy. I mean food slopped all over the place where a soup kitchen could have done it better.  The owners here are either ignorant or careless.",

    "text": "Having heard great word of mouth about Cafe Rio I came here with high expectations. The foundation of their menu is based on fresh flavorful ingredients and on that note they delivered. The freshness of the produce is evident and the fire grilled chicken has a nice flavor profile, especially in concert with the black beans & rice and topped off with homemade tortilla strips, fresh cilantro, and tomatillo dressing. They really knocked it out of the park on the flavors!   Unfortunately this Cafe Rio missed the mark on the service side on this visit. The crew on the front line, the only ones interacting with customers, looked like they were working on an assembly line in a factory. The first person on the line was in a big hurry to get each order started and moving down the line. She basically threw a spoonful each of rice, beans, and chicken into a tin pan and passed it on.   The next worker (after a significant delay so she could restock her station) asked (mumbled) what else I wanted on my salad in a monotone that made it crystal clear she didn't want to be there. Then she piled a huge wad of lettuce on top of my salad, which ultimately made for a poorly balanced salad. Most of the lettuce was in pieces too large to eat without cutting but there was no room to do that without losing much of it over the side of the bowl. When I got to my table I removed about half of the lettuce which was a big improvement.   My salad finally made it to the register. After the couple in front of me paid for their food another man walked up to the register and cut in front of me to pay for a carry out order. The person running the cash register apparently found this acceptable which I assume comes from management. Basically my food just sat on a tray in front of me for an extra 2-3 minutes so someone else could receive preferential service by being able to pay for their order even though it was not even ready!   These issues on the front line could easily be managed by an on site hands-on operator to enhance the customer experience. Someone has taken their eye off the ball here. I hope it gets fixed because the food warrants a return visit.",

You THINK you've had a good tortilla until you've experienced these. They're made right in front of you, are super light, chewy and just plain incredible. The flavors are on point, and they don't slop greasy ingredients into your bowl.   I love the options here, too. Although I'm in love with the tortillas, I've recently gone gluten-free - so the salad (without the tortilla) was a PERFECT solution for me. I got all the things I love about Cafe Rio, minus the gluten, and the servings are MASSIVE.   Thanks for giving us a healthier option with quick service!",

    "text": "I've never been a big fan of Cafe Rio but I thought I should give it another try.  It had been a few years though and I was not entirely sure what I was doing when I walked in.  Originally I was planning on getting a burrito but I reconsidered and thought I'd brach out and get enchiladas instead.  I wanted two.  One with the shredded chicken and one with shredded beef.  When the slow line I was in moved enough that I made it up to the counter I ordered two enchiladas.  I thought the lady working behind the counter asked me what beans I wanted to which I replied \"black beans.\"  Next thing I know she is filling my tortillas with beans and cheese and putting them in the oven.  Whoa! Time out. I wanted meat in those things.  I stopped them before they got too far and explained that I wanted meat in my enchiladas.  I apologized for the confusion.  I could tell she was as frustrated with me as I was with her.  She explained that the black beans I wanted come on the side.  I didn't see that there was another vat of beans further down the line.  Anyhow, she asked one of the other workers to throw away the mistakes and proceeded to make my two enchiladas with shredded beef without actually asking me what meat I wanted.  I didn't want to continue making a scene so I just let it go.  I was going to get one enchilada with shredded beef any how.  Two is fine too.  So with a double dousing of medium sauce, my enchiladas were in the oven.  It took a few more minutes before I made it down to where I was to receive my rice and black beans.  A scoop of rice.  A scoop of soupy beans and my meal was complete.  I took it all home to eat.  I'm not going to say that was a mistake but with all the sauce and soupy beans in my flimsy aluminum bowl/plate, I am thankful for the bag they gave me.  That stuff was starting to leak out over the edges on the drive home.  The mess didn't end there.  Trying to eat what was now effectively an enchilada stew from the aforementioned flimsy aluminum bowl/plate was an adventure in and of itself.  That thing has no structural integrity whatsoever.  You try to cut your enchilada, burrito, etc and the bowl just crumples and bends into a wadded mass of metal.  So irritating.  When all is said and done, eaten and gone, the experience of going to Cafe Rio was frustrating.  And to add to that frustration, I wanted so badly to be mad at the food too so I would not be tempted to come back and experience it again.  But for all of its soupy mess, the flavors were quite nice.  There was a fair amount beef in my enchiladas and the medium sauce did not overwhelm the pallate.  I'll give them that.  But I am still not a huge fan.  Cafe Rio is just not my plate of beans.",

When I arrived home I noticed the guacamole is light to dark brown. I tried to eat some thinking it may have just sat out for a minute to long, but no it was grotesque. I called the restaurant multiple times and I got a busy tone. When I finally got a hold of someone they told me the manager was busy and to call back in 15 minutes?!? I gave them my information and asked if the manager could call me when they were available. I received no call. What kind of pathetic excuse for customer service is going on?",

Cafe Rio was new to me as I'd never had one in other cities I'd lived in.   The food is pretty good for fast food. Mt favorite meats are Pork Barbacoa or Chile Roasted Beef. I like that they have a wide variety of meat options. All of the meats seem to be well prepared and flavorful. All of their food options come in huge portions that are reasonably priced for the portion size. The tortillas are made fresh in front of you which is cool. You can taste that they are fresh too. The drink options are really unique. My favorite is the Mint Limeade. They also offer specials each day to keep the menu unique.  Cafe Rio has a punch card to get a free item after 10 purchases and sometimes they put coupons in the mail for BOGO which is cool. That isn't something you'll get from their competitors.  This location gets crazy busy on weekends and at dinner time. Sometimes it takes 20+ minutes to get through the line even when the line isn't that long. If you get something quick and the five people in front of you have an item that takes longer you'll get stuck waiting. One night the people in front of me were very particular and my quesadilla sat while they asked for ten different sauces. Maybe I'd recommend pulling someone with one hot item to the front if others are going to be awhile. It wasn't even the wait that really bothered me, but watching my food get cold while waiting was annoying.",

She was at the register talking with her coworker when I so rudely interrupted her conversation to pay for my food. She continued to mutter words of disgust under her breath. Unfortunately I won't be giving this location my business any longer.",

I ordered 2 taco meal that says 7.99 with your choice of meat.  I chose carne asada with no extras like sour cream and guac .. I ordered a drink and my bill came out to 12.63.. a drink cost 2.19 how did it come out to that much. . I asked the cashier and she said they changed the prices on their other menu that I didn't even see.  They refused to refund or help the situation. . They need to change both menus because they are just confusing people",

    "text": "Cafe Rio...where have you been for most of my life? Ok, I admit I discovered you late in life but better late than never! Sweet...pork...barbacoa...whaaaaat?! So delish! It's like the Mexican BBQ pulled pork with a smokey sweetness that had me craving it for months! I turned everyone I knew onto it who didn't know from before. In a quesadilla, burrito, taco, tostada...oh heck I'd even try it on vanilla ice cream. I know sounds weird but give it a thought ;) Then there is their signature chicken...yummy WHITE meat chicken in a special light sauce that has me wondering why the other big Mex place can't serve white meat (?) The guacamole with salsa & cheese could be a meal in itself, creamy guac, crazy fresh salsa with just a pop of jalapeno to wake you up is perfection. They make their tortillas fresh...hardest working tortilla people in my opinion. They give you so much chips that by the end of your meal it doesn't look like you made a dent. The drink bar has the perfect makings for a virgin mojito. I like mixing the mint lemonade with the red stuff with a spritz of soda water. Plus they have flavored syrups if you want ice tea. Talk about the ultimate suicide drink bar!",

I come to this place frequently since it's a 5 minute drive from my apartment and I always order the same thing but they always get my order wrong. Something is always missing and when I tell them the problem they take FOREVER in fixing it. I've had to wait 45 min for them to fix a burrito which is pretty ridiculous. If this didn't happen so often I would rate it higher but it just happens way to often.",

    "text": "My experience here was better then expected after reading some reviews while in line. I decided to give this place 4 stars because the food (sweet pork & chicken tacos) was very good overall. The tortillas & ingredients were fresh and the atmosphere was fun.  What wasn't so good was the fact that some soda choices (e.g. Root-beer) were out of syrup. The time in line waiting to order while watching them prepare food (around 15 min ) seemed too long. It was a Monday night when I stopped in, and I don't know how it is at other times but overall I would say, even though the food tastes good if you only have a couple of minutes this place may not work for you.",

My favorite meat is the shredded chicken, and their creamy dressing is the best! It's slightly spicy, and completely delicious! They've messed up my order once, but when I came back, they gave me the missing item for free. I have tried the sweet pork barbacoa- it is sweet, so if you don't like sweet BBQ sauce, avoid it. A lot of my friends really like it though... The food is very fresh, and really good!",

It is not even real Mexican food. I tried the Chicken Quesadilla. After eating that I began to contemplate all other future decisions I will make when in life. It was terrible. I could not tell if there was cheese in it or if they just decided to make it even worse by not adding cheese. The staff is terrible. They stare at you like prisoners and watch you while you make an order. There was so much trash on the floor I thought I could have been on the slums of Mexico. The person that was supposed to be cleaning ended up getting side tracked and talking to a friend that was eating there. I go there not to be reminded of my lack of friends due to employees like this. If you enjoy eating off a menu with a lack of options, food with no real beef, and horrible hygiene then I recommend you eat at Cafe Rio and even try licking the ground because it is just \"spotless\"!",
