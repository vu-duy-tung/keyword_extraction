A-Maz-Zing. 5 stars for the warm sun and great chicken salad. Oh ya I ate the signature Salad (4 stars because it was little overwhelming with cheese.) Few more visits I may bring this up to a 5 :) Will go back.",

I don't know if it was the seasoning or marinade they used but i wasn't a huge fan.... I ate it all, but probably wouldn't go back just for that reason. The salad however, was delicious and I he tomatoes were bright red and beautiful.  One other thing I might add, that was kind of annoying (our lunch for 3 people and 1 child was around $60) When we were sitting down, asked for a small side of hummus, and they brought out a very small side... and also dropped off a bill for $1 for it. I hate when restaurants nickel and dime...",

They told me 20 minutes for my order (gyro, fries and a drink) and I was willing to wait. 20 min went by. At 30 minutes I went back to counter and inquired. \"Working on it\" 33 minute wait for a gyro and fries??? Are you Frickin kidding me?????  I have gone to Yardhouse and gotten a fillet cooked for me in LESS time! SERIOUSLY!!  These people at Meraki are morons. In my opinion, if it takes you 33 minutes to produce  a gyro sandwich and an order of fries you should just close your doors. Oh......just in case 33 minutes wasn't long enough......my order came out WRONG too!!  And no apology by the way.",

The Mezze plate seemed like a good choice to share between the two of us since it contains an assortment of items. The spreads, which included a smooth and nutty hummus and a creamy tzatziki stood out for us. Everything was well seasoned and flavorful without being overpowering. I've never had dolmades before but these were very good. The spanakopita filling wasn't all that good but the flaky filo was perfect. The falafel was my least favorite item of all since they were too dry and fried too hard, but the flavor was okay. The tomato salad with red onion, Persian cucumbers and feta was great for cleansing the palate and readying our taste buds for desert. For desert we chose to share the rice pudding and the baklava ice cream. GET THE RICE PUDDING!! Best rice pudding I've ever had- perfect texture of chewy yet soft rice with a good amount of cinnamon and sweetness. The baklava ice cream is an interesting concept but wasn't as good as the rice pudding. It contained a huge piece of baklava so that's a plus. Overall this place deserves all five stars. The food tastes homey and fresh, prices are good, and service is great.",

The decor was inviting and clean.    The reason for the 2 Star review is mainly due to the ridiculously rude server.  A young woman named Rose I believe.  Here attitude was the worst I have ever encountered in a restaurant.  She was nasty to me when I took out my Amex to pay and said, \"No American Express\".  She was yelling at the cooks in the kitchen.  She must be the daughter of the owner or something, but she is just flat out awful.  The other reason for the 2 Stars is that it took 13 minutes to get my gyro and fries when there was only two other tables in the restaurant at the time.    There are other Greek places in town that have food just as good, but I can get served much quicker and it is served by smiling faces.  Sorry Meraki, but I will not be returning.",

The village salad didn't come with lettuce but with big slices of tomatoes, cucumbers, and such. I also got a side of shrimp with my salad. The food was good - light & refreshing. The fries were perfectly crisp & the feta wasn't overpowering or anything.   I'm inclined to come back because the food was good but honestly the prices were a little steep. For the 2 items, it came out to almost $30... and it only came with 4 pieces of shrimp lol. But the portions are pretty big (besides the shrimp lol) so maybe it cancels it out?",

I usually order the steak plate (filet mignon, so tender and flavorful at a reasonable price) or the chicken plate. Comes with pita, taziki sauce (which is amazing), salad, and feta fries. Everything was delicious, reasonably priced, and healthy.  Weird side note: The only trash can for customers is located in the restroom, very inconvenient and weird.",

You got a lot but it could have been seasoned better. The rice pilaf wasn't good at all. I don't like when Greek restaurants serve the generic Ricearoni pilaf. The rice is an essential part of the dish and it was disappointing. I also got a chicken kabob and it was okay. Better than the beef but not that great.   The people weren't that friendly. They weren't rude but they weren't welcoming either. There was plenty of seating available and the restaurant was nice and clean.   I wouldn't come back because I've had much better Greek food. Market City Grille tastes a lot better and serves authentic rice.",

The food does take longer to come out than your average Greek place.  I would say the speed is more like a traditional restaurant than a quick serve, like it is marketed.

One of my work colleagues recommended this location to our other work colleagues that were in town from other states through-out the U.S. We decided to go here, and WOW!!!! One word, WOW!! The food tasted amazing! The staff was, like, out of this world. They were so friendly, so welcoming, and just absolutely awesome. We did not have to wait long before putting in our order. I ended up ordering off the kids menu - the Chicken Kalamaki. The portion size was so large. I couldn't even finish the kids meal. It came with a small drink, the chicken kalamaki, pita, rice pilaf, and cucumbers. It was more like lunch and dinner combined into one meal. Crazy amount of food, and the awesome thing was, the food was so delicious. I can't wait to come back here again and try something new out. The actual restaurant was tidy and clean. The restrooms were spotless, which is pretty unusual for a busy restaurant such as Meraki Greek Grill. The parking is atrocious. There's not much parking space selection, so you're typically having to wait and spot a free parking spot when it becomes available.",

Our waitress made sure we knew what everything was and answered all of our questions. We got two Classic Greek Salads and they were super fresh and tasted great. We also got pita bread which came with hummus, yoghurt, and other sides. It was also delicious.",

    "text": "My family decided to take me out to Sunday  dinner, so I won't spend all day over a hot stove. Greek food was on top of everyone's list, so we decided to check out \"Meraki\". With over 300 reviews and a 5* rating and even good large strip restaurant chef's saying the food was good, we had to try it out. I have to mention that I spent half of the year in Greece, I am a dissent cook and very picky when it comes to Greek food. So... let's talk about the layout and decor  It's a cute fast food, \"Grill\" wanna be.  We ordered  The Octopus appetizer (Not available, they only have it on the special menu) Taramosalata (Not available) Tirokafteri (was too hot not very authentic 3*)  Saganaki (was good 4.5*) Pork kalamaki (good 4*) Beef kalamaki  (a little dry 3*) Gyro (The spices where all wrong for a Greek gyro, not tasty at all 2*) Rice (bland 3*) Feta fries (Arbys fries with feta on it 3*) Ravani (very good 4*) Baklava  (too dry, not enough spices, no          butter taste 3*) Rice pudding  (good 3.5*) Baklava ice cream  (icy no taste , it felt like they used old baklava sence  it was very hard 2.5*) Service was fast and friendly  (4*) We paid $98 + tip for  4 dinner plates  3 soft drinks  4 deserts  I believe for a fast food place it might be a little high. I pay about the same or a little less in Astoria NY but the taste is more original and their rent is double of LV. Over all we had a nice dinner. Now would \"I\" go back?  I don't think so, my \"full blooded Fresh of the boat Greek husband\" will not let me. My daughter that spends some of her vacation days in Greece will not go back.  My son has no time for vacation, so when he is on that site of town he probably will.",

If that doesn't convince you the food is amazing, then let me tell you about their feta fries. These fries seem lightly battered and seasoned to perfection, then doused with feta cheese and herbs. They're placed under a broiler to finish and the feta melts into the fries. They are the stuff fry dreams are made of. I've also had the gyro, a gyro salad, chicken skewer and shrimp skewer. Nothing has disappointed me yet. Their food is fresh and full of flavor. The chicken skewer is made with the most plump and juicy morsels of chicken, sprinkled with lemon and spices. If you show up right when they open, you can avoid the wait and the crowd.",

    "text": "Note:  This is a somewhat identical write up on my review of my other favorite Greek Restaurant (The Great Greek in Henderson).  I like them both equally so I figured they both deserve equal reviews (with just some slight/minor differences).   Meraki is one of the few Greek words that does not have an actual and/or  literal  English translation.  But figuratively, I'd say it's somehow close to \"passion\"  (but it really is not because Greeks have a word for passion, which is \"pathos\"). Anyway, the word \"meraki\" remains one of the few untranslatable Greek words.     I rarely eat out for Greek food as I can prepare them myself but when I crave souvlakia, gyros kai pites during tempelikes meres, they are one of the only two places I go to  (the other one being The Greak Greek in Henderson, closer to where I live).   I fly to Greece once a year being a Greek resident,  and as such I can vouch for their food as the closest to the real thing (especially how they season their proteins).  I just wish they would use a tad more greek rigani and for their horiatiki, maybe serve thick feta slices instead of the (I guess Athen's or President brand?) feta crumbles.  But hey, am not complaining, re!   Their serving portions are much bigger and prices are slightly higher than The Greak Greek's but still relatively reasonable, they have more on their menu so there's more choices.  However, I kinda wonder if their spanakopita are made from scratch .  I've only tried it once but they kinda look and taste the same as the spanokopita I periodically get from Costco.  And, avoid coming here during lunch hours as they get very busy and packed.    And lastly:  I also wish they'd greet and say bye to customers with a simple:  \"Yasas!\"  Other than that:  Am a BIG FAN !",

We ordered:  Hummus Melizanosalata--roasted eggplant Falafel Pita Saganaki Gyro and chicken plate with French fries and Greek salad Rice pudding Baklava Ravani--sweet semolina cake Baklava ice cream  This was a good amount of food for three people.  It was coursed nicely by very friendly staff.  The pita is pretty standard and somewhat blah.  One of the highlights was the saganaki.  The cheese was very flavorful and it stretched as we picked up pieces to put on our plates.  I wasn't as pleased with the baklava because it was somewhat dry and I like mine served with honey that helps to moisten the flaky pastry.  The semolina cake and the rice pudding are must orders if you're getting dessert.  A very good meal with excellent service provided by a friendly staff who do things with the Meraki motto on the wall.",

The idea that a place can sustain consistent quality makes me very very glad we found this place.   We've tried quite a bit of stuff on the menu (as we get something different every time) and most of it is really good.   The dolmadaki is fantastic.   Best I've ever had and it is the one item we get every time.  The spanikopita is pretty delicious as well.    The Greek rice is probably my favorite rice of all that feel places I've ever been to.   So flavorful and delicious.   The only items I've ever tried that I wasn't so hot about were at this last outing.   The agvolemono needs more jazz and the broccoli needs less cooking.   But if that's it then there isn't actually anything to complain about.   The service is amazing here as well.   You can tell they are a family and like to treat you like you are part of it.   Very friendly, very helpful, very patient.   It also doesn't hurt that I haven't seen one employee who isn't good looking...",

I got the jumbo shrimp plate and the shrimp were grilled perfectly and the rice is super flavorful. The salad that comes with was fresh and tasty as well. I also got a side of steak skewer which was cooked perfectly and charred nicely.  Feta fries are very good too. Something about the feta cheese and the oregano is just perfect, probably would have been better fresh and not taken out though.  Overall everything was just realllly good quality and well prepared. To go containers were very nice as well and organized.  Will definitely be back, and they are only one block away which is sweet.",

In a city of good restaurants , it's not very often where we are blessed to have a Great Resturant open its doors . From the decor to the staff and most importantly the FOOD , this place is must have/try.  The owner/chef and his family really care and its demonstrated in the warm family atmosphere and fantastic, fresh , flavorful food. Local or just visiting u HAVE TO try this place.  U will not be disappointed I promise.  The hummus is home made and gyro are best in town. The kabobs ( kalamaki) are excellent . Try the soup too . Mmmm so good !!!! They also have a great authentic dessert line up as well . This place will be around for a very very long time . My compliments to the great people who opened this place .  . Great job !!!!

    "text": "Their menu is simple with a great selection of Greek specialties and food that's just good for you. The first section is appetizers; Spreads (Greek spreads are so much more than just Hummus and Tzatziki!) and classics like Spanakopita and Dolmadakia (Stuffed Grape Leaves). I like to order the Mezze Plate ($12.79) with Spanakopita, Tzatziki, Hummus, Falafel, Dolmadakia, Marinated Olives, Tomato Salad, and Pita. It's a fantastic way to get a little taste of everything, especially when you can't decide! I would love to try all their spreads next time since I'm a fan of Taramasalata and Melizanosalata (roasted eggplant spread similar to Baba Ganoush, but without tahini); you can get a combination of all five spreads for $21.95.  The second section is basically three dishes: Meraki Signature Bowl ($9.49) Classic Greek Salad ($6.49/$8.79) Village Greek Salad ($7.49/$9.49)  The difference between the Classic Greek and the Village Greek salads is the absence of lettuce in the latter, which is more common in Greece. The salads are loaded with tomato, red onion, cucumber, feta cheese, Kalamata olives, pepperoncini, and Greek vinaigrette; plus, grilled pita (I got Tzatziki with mine as well). The signature bowl comes with a choice of Greek Rice or Aegean Quinoa and its elements are the same as the salads with the addition of arugula, marinated garbanzo beans, sliced red radish, and Tzatziki. Very hearty!  There are eleven add-on options with four Vegetarian options. I've tried the Pork Kalamaki ($3.49), Shrimp Kalamaki ($4.49), and Grilled Salmon ($6.95). Kalamaki is a synonym of Souvlaki (used primarily in Southern Greece), but essentially are the grilled meat skewers. Everything I've had is delicious. I really enjoyed the salmon on their Classic Greek Salad as it was light, yet filling. It's a dish I could eat over and over.  The third section has sandwiches (gyros, burgers) and platters/plates. I've had the Gyro Meraki ($7.95) with beef/lamb, tomato, lettuce, red onion, Tzatziki, and feta cheese; and the Gyro Plate ($12.95) with Greek Rice or Fries, Greek salad, pita, and Tzatziki. I love gyro meat (the famous beef/lamb spit) and both are great options; they're essentially the same, so it just depends on my mood. I've had my eye on their Lamb Burger and I'm determined to try it on my next visit.  For desserts, I absolutely love the Baklava Ice Cream ($3.95)! It's Baklava mixed into vanilla ice cream for the perfect treat. Although it's not on the menu, they serve Greek coffee and it is amazing. It's in Espresso format (very small) and I like it sweetened. It transports me back to Greece!  They offer daily specials that are indicated on a 8x10\" display at the registers. I've seen Lavraki (Mediterranean Sea Bass) and steak sandwiches. The most popular special has been their Grilled Octopus ($17.49). It's been served in a couple different ways and it's availability is random, but if it's there when you are, definitely order it. When I had it, there was a Greek-style White Bean Salad that was a nice accompaniment, but the octopus was great on its own. The owner told me that specials are usually offered during dinner since they want to keep service quick during the day, however, I have seen the specials during lunch on weekends.  I am thrilled to have Meraki close to home and I am loving all of it. It does tend to get really busy during lunch, but it moves quickly. The service is amazing, too!",

Every time I've been, they greet me with a smile. Maybe they're getting used to see me?   Anyway, it's kind of a quick serve place: go to the counter to order then they bring it out to you. They have Coke Freestyle machine (but sadly, no lime flavored stuff so no diet coke with lime D: ) and fresh brewed tea, as well as a cooler full of beers.   If you're feeling sick, their soup is the way to go! But their gyros are also extremely tasty. And if you love fries & feta cheese, check out their feta fries. You won't regret it!",

Excellent lamb burgers served on ciabatta rolls, and they have village Greek salad (the kind with no lettuce like you actually get in Greece), very good feta fries, and a soda dispenser that allows you to customize your drink (Coke products- thumbs up).    The staff is friendly and they get the orders right. And, the place always looks clean and well kept. Only gripes are that it is a very casual place where you order at the counter (although food is served on real plates), and the prices are more reflective of a sit-down restaurant. And, while the baklava ice cream looked and sounded good, it was actually pretty icy and somewhat of a disappointment.   Kind of a drive for us but will definitely return. Still closer than Mykonos.",

Meraki gets busy around lunch time but the extra 5min wait is worth every second. My personal favorite is the pork skewer plate with feta fries. I can equally highly rate their chicken lemon soup and the spreads. The hummus is nothing like I have had before! Last time I went there for lunch I asked if they had any specials. Turns out they change them daily and a lucked out for some grilled octopus that was not on the menu. I am exited to go back and go for a Lavraki special or roasted baby lamb with lemon potatoes. I had the pleasure to chat with the owner Jerry on my last visit and I am exited now to take advantage of their extensive catering abilities. In short, now I have to go for the baklava icecream :)",

Their lamb gyro is so good. The meat is so tender and doesn't taste gamey at all. I would come back here for their gyros and ice cream. But I wouldn't add onions if I come here for lunch and have to go back to work, unless my chewing gums are very powerful. For some reason, their onions are very strong.   Nice location, restaurant is clean and I like their choice of music. Service is good, the staff is really friendly and nice.   I can't wait to come back here again.",

There was nobody else in line so I don't see what the big deal was. My food was silently dropped off a good while later, not a word said to me, just plopped my food down and walked away.  I've never had bland Mediterranean food before, but this place seems to have achieved it. Like I literally couldn't even taste the \"lamb\" because it had less flavor than the shredded lettuce in my gyro.  So the gyro was about $9 and she tried to push the combo on me but I don't like soda but said I did want fries. So she charged me $4 for a little side of plain fries, when the combo would have been cheaper. Then as I was looking around, everyone else who had fries had good looking fries covered in feta and garlic sauce or something, mine were plain, not even given ketchup. And seriously? Freakin $4 for a little side of plain fries?   In summary, way overpriced, very bland and very rude. Won't be back. Too many good places in this city to go to a lousy one twice. I left here feeling like i should apologize to them for inconveniencing them with my patronage.",

If you have no idea what something is no sweat!  The staff is helpful in recommending.  Personally my favorites are the tzatziki (creamy dill yogurt dip) with cucumbers or pita, the grilled octopus (if this special is still available), the gyro plates, and finish it off with all three -- rice pudding, baklava and the baklava ice cream.

Notable friendly workers, especially the young bearded man. Also liked their bottled beer selection bringing back wonderful vacation memories.  Order at the counter, take your order number and wait for your huge metal platter of food to arrive. Taking a cue from fellow yelpers, shared a massive sliced euro platter with upgraded feta fries. So satisfying at the flavors, fresh salad and the taziki sauce.  They have brewed iced tea, too.  Bathroom clean and decorative with Greek pictures. Loved the music playing.......oh, yeah, we're still in Vegas. Felt like I was somewhere in the Greek islands.",

    "text": "Meraki Greek Grill, in my opinion, is the epitome of \"Woohoo! As good as it gets!\"  I have visited three times now. The only complaint I have is that it's so good that you may have to wait a minute or two to claim a parking space and a table during peak times.   This visit, my husband and I brought his parents. My mother-in-law can be a rather discerning diner. She has, on occasion, completely dismissed a restaurant right at the table if she felt they were lacking in service, taste, cleanliness or atmosphere. I try to steer away from anything other than venues that provide full waiter service to avoid the potential stress. I wasn't worried this time.   To that point, midway through her meal, she uttered the words \"plato perfecto (perfect plate)\" and proceeded to sing Meraki's praises. Yeah, man, it's THAT good.   For this visit, we ordered:  - Tirokafteri (feta and roasted red pepper dip with pita bread). Great sharpness and creaminess from the feta cheese, with a nice kick from the red pepper. I had to pace myself with this to avoid being the greedy a-hole that ate all the dip.   - Small Greek Salad with Salmon. I usually order the small Greek salad with 1-2 add-ons. I added the falafel and gyro on the first visit, salmon and falafel on the second visit, and just salmon this time. While all three items are great, the salmon is exceptional. I was surprised to find such a great and perfectly cooked piece of fish atop a super crisp, super fresh, super delicious salad. Seriously. It's better than salmon I've been served at \"fancier\" establishments.  - Gyro Plate with Rice: My husband ordered this for both of the two visits he's made. He likes everything about it and probably will continue to order this moving forward. He tends to stick to what he likes (probably good for me, yeah?).   - Meraki Signature Bowl with Rice and Salmon: This was the \"plato perfecto\" that my MIL had for lunch today. It was beautiful. She enjoyed every bite and had about 1/3 left to take home.   - Avgolemono: Due to a communication snafu, my FIL had eaten lunch before we arrived to pick them up. He thought we were meeting for dinner. Fortunately, he had room for soup and dessert. Let's just say the soup bowl was totally clean after all was said and done.   - Ravani (Sweet Semolina Cake): OHMYGOD, where has this been all my life? What a perfectly sweet, but not cloyingly sweet dessert. The cake was most, but not too heavy, and it was accented with a lemony syrup and chopped pistachios. I want more ASAP.   - Baklava Ice Cream: I have to confess that I am not the biggest fan of baklava. I assume I may not have had \"good\" baklava. That said, I love this ice cream. It eliminates my biggest problem with baklava , which is too much stickiness and a dense chewiness. In its place, you get a nutty creaminess accentuated by bits of flaky filo dough. You can even taste the filo. I suppose I should try Meraki's baklava soon. And the authentic Greek yogurt with honey and walnuts.   - Sodas: Coca-Cola remix machine, guys! Plus points for not having Pepsi, but plus plus points for being able to have flavored Diet Coke or Diet Sprite.   The service is also great. Everyone I've encountered has been nothing short of friendly and helpful. As we were leaving, of the staff members even stopped by and asked my MIL how she found everything.   This honestly may be one of my favorite spots in the city. At the very least, it's my favorite fast casual Greek spot in the city.   Solid choice all around.",

We started with some super lemony hummus and then moved on to a giant lamb burger and a huge gyro sandwich. The cheese fries are insanely good as well, with multiple types of cheese and loads of garlic. I'm currently at home munching on a large serving of delicious baklava. I'm not sure if it's made in house, but it tastes like it is.  I could tell they were having a bad day, but that made no impact on the quality of the food. I will definitely be going back.",

I ordered the Gyro Meraki with beef and lamb and I honestly cannot think of a better way to spend $8. (I guess I'm used to Bay Area prices, but I thought $8 was a STEAL for such a delicious and filling lunch.) The lamb and beef were tender and flavorful, the tomatoes were super fresh, and the tzatziki sauce rounded out this perfect gyro. The portion size is substantial -- I had been starving and still couldn't quite finish my gyro. However, I always have room for dessert, so I ordered rice pudding to share with my boyfriend. Ohhh, the rice pudding was delightful! The server said they had just made it and I could tell -- it was creamy, perfectly sweet, and flavored with cinnamon and vanilla. Heavenly!  This casual restaurant is bright, clean, and efficient. I love how each table is topped with a fresh plant. The staff are super friendly and the food selection is amazing. Meraki serves up top-notch Greek food and I can't wait to go back next time I'm in Vegas! This place totally lives up to its solid 5 stars on Yelp!",

Last visited in August, sitting down amidst hues of blue and a mural of Zeus accompanied by exemplary service, it was 24-hours in advance that a call to Meraki found staff unwilling to take an order for the next day, a promise that \"if someone comes right at 11:00am we'll have the order ready by 11:15am\" all they could offer and thus what was selected with items actually packed and ready to go three minutes early.  Driven just ten minutes to the final destination, a meal for two discussing new horizons in GLP-1 Receptor Agonists the setting, it was with items unwrapped that a small clamshell of Eggplant Puree once again proved slightly smoky and nicely textured, the store-bought Pita still a disappointment considering Amena Bakery & Deli, Parsley Mediterranean and Kabob Oasis all produce their own on-site daily.  Eating while listening, a 'side' of Falafel presenting four crispy Chickpea Fritters loaded with Onions and Garlic, it was with these plus accompanying Greens dipped into a small cup of Tzatziki that the meal marched onward, a side of French Fries good but already a touch soggy thanks to the closed Styrofoam clamshell while Meraki's Lamb Burger was overcooked and as crumbly as the Feta atop it with the Bun unfortunately affected similar to the Fries and thus exceedingly messy.  Going through several more napkins than the one provided in an attempt to 'enjoy' the Burger, though after three bites a fork and knife became essential, it was finally with a small plastic pod of Greek Yogurt topped in Honey and Walnuts that a conclusion was reached - not only that Greek Yogurt is indeed delicious, but that Glucagon-like peptide-1 remains a great target while Meraki is best for dining in.  TWO AND A HALF STARS:  While supporting locals is an admirable goal it only works insofar as locals are willing to be supported and as Meraki is apparently doing well enough to take a pass on pre-orders it looks like future visits will have to be dine-in while the office continues to cater from inferior Mediterranean Restaurants.",

Wifey & I came here on a whim after church one weekend because we wanted something not too heavy, but with lots of color.  One Yelp lookup later, and Meraki it was!  I had heard raves about this place before but now I know what all the fuss is about!  Simple, but tasty Greek eats!!  Meraki was lively when we entered - Greek music playing, lots of folks laughing & eating, happy!  Anyone breaking plates, anyone?  I would have joined in!  Really easy menu to view over with appetizers, salads, bowls, gyros, pitas, grill plates, and desserts.  We stuck with something somewhat classic since it was our 1st time:  -Gyro Meraki ($7.95) - Beef/Lamb (yes stick with this) with tomato, lettuce, red onion, tzatziki, feta  We both got the combo for an extra $2.95 each.  Wifey got her gyro with red onion on the side, Greek Salad (add another $0.95) & a drink.  I got my gyro with EXTRA red onion (oh man how I single-handedly saved Tic-Tacs), Feta Fries (add another $0.79) & a drink.  Do you like feta?  I hope you do because Meraki does too!  They piled the feta on our gyros, and on my fries!  But their feta is very fresh - not overly strong & not dry at all!  So tasty!  Complimented our gyros very well!  And the gyros?  Delicious!  Overflowing with beef/lamb that was flavorful, tender, and not very lamb-y at all.  And stuffed with lots of fresh veggies!  And the tzatziki?  Damn was it tasty too, my guess is it's made in house!  Tangy, garlicky, creamy - perfect with the rich meat.  Pita was supple & warm, like a pillow for all this Greek goodness.  Absolutely yummy gyros!  The sides were great too - wife's Greek Salad was easily dressed with good quality olive oil, lemon, salt & pepper, feta, and black olives.  So fresh!  Feta Fries were good as well, crunchy fries, with a ton of feta!  To top it all off...they serve Coca-Cola!!  Yessssssss!  Overall it was a delicious lunch!  Freshness was key!  We really enjoyed our meal at Meraki Greek Grill.  We plan on going back soon by looking at the dishes that came out all around us - the Mezze Plate looked like it could feed 4 people!  The whole Rotisserie Chicken platter too!  The Lamb Burger totally looked like a winner!  And you can be sure next time we're gonna get some of the Greek sweets too!",

Both entree's were excellent! Cooked perfectly, was not over cooked, or dried out.  We saw the couple next to us with the special of the day which was lamb chops. We had to order that as well. Absolutely amazing lamb chops, seasoned and grilled to perfection!! I didn't get a chance to take pictures of the chops or dessert, I was busy!  Dessert was amazing! We had the honey and walnut Greek yogurt, unlike any Greek yoghurt I have had in my life!! Absolutely Awesome!! The baklava ice cream! I'm still trying to find the words to describe how great it is! Awesome, and Amazing doesn't give it the credit it deserves!! I will fly back to Vegas for this!! Mic Drop!!.....",

It crushed my gyro craving but honestly wasn't fantastic. Ive certainly had better. The hummus was okay but sort of bland. I ordered a side of olives that had barely any flavor, almost like they were old. I feel kind of bad saying this but the chicken seemed like i don't know how to put it. It looked weird and had sort of a weird texture? Not really into it.",

Well I was surprised ...it was without a doubt 4.5 stars. Prices are similar to others. The quantity was excellent as well as the quality. You place your order at the front counter and are given a plastic number tent to put on your table. The service was excellent. I would recommend this place and will return again.",

The wife ordered a meraki signature bowl, and watching her try to eat it was hilarious.  She basically has dinner, and probably breakfast for tomorrow.  Everything was pretty fantastic, including the presentation, the service (someone came around to ask us how we were, and to offer my wife a box for her salad), and the clean, simple decor.",

This place is in the middle of a nondescript strip mall right off of Rainbow and Tropicana, but man, they serve up some pretty bomb food.  I got the chicken kebab plate (the kalamakia, I think they call it), and it was served with some salad, pita bread, and fries.  When I asked for fries, the cashier asked, 'regular fries, or feta fries?'  I had no idea what feta fries were, but I love fries, and I love feta, so let's do it!  The GF had some sort of a salad bowl concoction with falafel.  The food came out, and first of all, it's a LOT of food.  I usually eat a lot but even I was laboring through it at the end, but it was so good I had to finish.  I've had chicken kebab that was too dry, too juicy, too flavored, not flavored enough, but this one was just perfect.  And those aforementioned feta fries?  Mmmmmmmmmmmm.....   My GF couldn't even finish her salad bowl - that thing was humongous too.  Plus the workers there were extremely friendly and polite which really added to the comfortable atmosphere.    I would definitely come back to this place the next time I'm in Vegas!!",

While it's current age  techy with their large screens as menus and clean  modern feel inside, you'll still have the opportunity to hear them argue with love about orders in the kitchen. It's the perfect place for a fresh, clean and affordable meal. They have a large menu that includes traditional appetizers, salads, sides, sampler plates, gyros, bowls, and desserts. I've ordered the Mezze Platter twice now that I highly recommend for vegetarians or anyone looking for a light meal as it's a sampler of their dips, falafels, salad, stuffed grape leaves and olives.",

I'd like to tell you that we had plenty of food leftover but it was all so delicious that we barely could walk out, we were so full.   We had made the sandwiches a combo so  we also had the Avgolemon soup. Perfect and hearty for a cold and windy day.

Ya'll need to order it like right now.   I'm already getting full off of the fries and I still had the gyro. That shiiii is huge too. I'm not really a lamb person... I prefer chicken.

I almost always grab the mezz plate, which is a little variety of different apps to share.  The meraki gyro is delicious and so is the lamb burger!!!  My favorite menu item??? That would be the rice bowl with salmon.  Damn sounds so basic, but I crave it everyday.  It's very well executed with so many fresh ingredients.

But let me say this..... is all my years reading reviews and especially consulting Yelp, never once have I written a single review, despite how great or how lacking an experience. NOT ONCE! But today is the day. Today I was so blown away by not one category, but in all fronts! Price and value? CHECK! Excellent service, speedy food preparation? CHECK THAT BOX ALSO! Atmosphere, cleanliness, vibe and overall appearance? CHECK, CHECK, CHECK! But here is the real reason for the review..... how was the food? Well, I am having trouble finding the words to describe what I just experienced. Just plain old DAMN GOOD FOOD! Nothing fancy, nothing too flashy, but my goodness was everything on point. The salad, crisp and fresh! The rice, heaven on earth! (Been eating at Greek places for about 4 years searching for that falafel is it? Not sure of the name, I call it rice) but long story short go for the rice alone! I had the steak kalamakia plate while my wife had the chicken. Both were amazing, and I mean amazing! Coming from a 295lb food expert btw. I know my food and this steak rivaled those from steak houses, recently had Fogo de Chao and it was just as good if not better! It literally melted in my mouth! The chicken, geez.  Never had chicken that flavorful and that MOIST AND JUICY! How do they do that????!!!!    And for those of you who do what I do.... I'm a big guy, I love big portions..... LOOK NO FURTHER, THIS IS YOUR PLACE!!! I am the guy the buffets try to flip the CLOSED sign on when they see me coming and my plate put the big hurt on me, super filling but super delicious and that's what matters most. Quantity and Quality so no compromise. Come here, you can probably order anything off the menu and you'll be highly satisfied.   One last note, I always take this into consideration for a restaurants cleanliness as I can taste the difference in their drinking water. Try the water, that tells you a lot of the place. If they don't even change the water filters on tap or ice maker, they are laze and it leaves a nasty aftertaste. Yet another reason why I give this place my first ever review, the water was as good as the food... AMAZING!!! Best water I ever had. How can that be??? I've been to the best of the best. I've sampled water filtered in the most sophisticated facilities using the most comprehensive filtration media and devices and this beat them hands down! Customer for life!",

This is a True family restaurant from what I gather. The food is 100% authentic. To say that this is a hidden gem would be a lie. Out of all of the traffic that goes there, a good 90% goes there. They are incredibly welcoming and treat you as that you are their only customer. It's a rarity now Vegas to find someplace like this. If you are ever in the area of Rainbow and Tropicana it's a must to stop by. You won't be disappointed.",

The eggplant salad and pepper/feta dip were delicious. The baklava ice cream and the cake were also great! The dolma is clearly homemade and tastes super fresh, they use great grape leaves. The only criticism I can offer is the rice, it was a little more on the sour side without anything to balance it out. Regardless, this is my favorite Greek restaurant in Vegas after Milos (which is a fine dining strip restaurant - a comparison would be unfair).",

    "text": "Looking for a new Mediterranean place for lunch and this place came up on my search with 5 stars. It's set up as a fast food place, where you go up to the counter to order and pay. They'll give you a number and then bring the food to your table. I had their small size Greek salad ($6.95) with a beef kalamaki (skewer) add-on ($3.95). It came with 2 quarter pieces of pita bread and some tzatziki sauce. Great dressing on the salad, which made it taste very refreshing. I asked for medium on the beef and it was cooked right. The beef had good flavor, but could've been more tender. It was still tasty overall. My friend had the chicken and she said it was very juicy, so I'll try that next time. What I ordered made a perfect portion for lunch without having a leftover afterward. Not too much, but not too little. Note that this place is quite small and gets really busy during lunch time (I'm talking about line up to the door and all seats occupied) so seatings can be hard to find during peak hours.",

    "text": "I heard great things about this place from one of our UMC hospitalists, so decided to try it out for dinner one night on the way back home (takeout, since it is close to my house). The exterior is nothing fancy, but the interior is very new, bright, and warm. The entire restaurant is spotless.  The format is fast casual, though the presentation and quality of the food is definitely sit-down restaurant level. The workers were all very friendly and happy to answer any questions about the menu. The employee I interacted with the most in particular had a very welcoming smile! =)  I ended up trying one of their specials, which change regularly. It was grilled octopus, and was phenomenal (I LOVE octopus). It was night quite as pretty in the takeout container as plated (I peeked at a neighboring table who had ordered it), but the taste was just the same. I also ordered avgolemono soup, which was great, though I would have liked it every more tart. I also wanted to try the feta fries, which were tasty but probably best hot, they were more lukewarm by the time I ate them at home.   I love Greek food and Mediterranean food in general, and will definitely be back to try more of Meraki's tasty menu! Prices are very reasonable and quality is better than expected. It seems like a family-owned and oriented establishment that takes a lot of pride in its food.",

It's not thick and it had a lot of flavor. The cheese was warm and I love how it tasted with a little lemon juice. The lamb plate was huge! Great portions too! Neither of us finished it.  We were about to order dessert but the cashier told us the register was closed.  However, one of the servers offered us the dessert on the house! So we enjoyed the baklava ice cream and OMG that was BOMB! will definitely go here again!",

I ordered a chicken and steak kabob plate. Chicken was good, the steak was real chewy, not tender at all. One thing that's great if you're real hungry, is their portions are huge. Great Greek and Crazy Pita are still my favs so far.",

The staff brings your food to the table and picks up the dirty plates. The staff was so nice and friendly and made you feel at home. My group stayed for a while but so did everyone else that came in. People were hanging out and having a good time. I ordered the Meraki gyro which was delicious and the feta fries...Yumm! We had a bunch of appetizers to share like hummus,  htipiti, and taramousalata spreads which were all good but my fave was the htipiti. Can't wait to go back and try the salads!

From one to three the visits were great, service was absolutely great, food was excellent, presentation was excellent and the atmosphere was exceptional.  This visit however was not the same.  Of all the staff there we got a smile from only one.  While the food was good it did not live up to the first three visits.  I placed our order and asked that everything be served at the same time, the Mediterranean Grilled Octopus was great as far as seasoning, though the dish had been changed, and instead of being served over a salad was served over cold beans.  Also when my wife asked the blonde server if there was a difference and was told they changed things when they wanted. After the Octopus waited some fifteen minutes for the remainder of the food to arrive and was cold by that time, the salad delivered was not the one I ordered and the Steak Kalamaki platter I ordered with French fries came with rice and the steak kabobs had no seasoning on them at all.  Overall the food while a little bland was still good.  For the first time since coming here both my wife and I had to salt our entire meal.  Too bad they had already set the bar so high previously so we know what they are capable of.  The food earns five stars, the service tonight brought that down to three.",

    "text": "Another of those wonderful Yelp finds.  We were looking for something light for dinner & didn't want to pay high strip prices & fight crowds so did a quick search for something further out.  Came across this gem and the only thing I can say bad is that it is not near where I live because it is SO GOOD!  Husband & I each had the gyro meat platter and when they say it is huge they are not kidding.  We were each \"starving\" & still only finished half our plates.  The salads were a standout--full of fresh, crisp, flavorful ingrediants, the pita was fresh and fluffy (not the dried out pre-packaged ones we usually get near us), the tzatiziki delicious and creamy, the rice and meat great as well.  Service was super helpful & friendly. It is so nice and refreshing to find someone who is enthusiastic, friendly, and eager to tell you about their specialties--I wish I could remember the girl's name who helped us, she was really good.  We wanted to come back to try the lamb burgers, but I got sick & then we had to leave to come home.  :( Hope we are able to get to town again soon & we will be back!",

If I have one complaint, it was that the gyro meat was a bit dry, but that might be because we arrived shortly after they opened and it was probably the outside part of the meat and not cut later in the day.  The salads were great, the feta fries were great and we will definitely be back!!",

    "text": "We had the worst experience ever.  I was visiting a friend in Las Vegas for 4th of July and we decided to go to Meraki. I was there with my two small shih tzu dogs and a 6 months old puppy. I live in West Hollywood and I take my dogs everywhere and they are accepted inside the establishments. I still took into consideration that I was visiting a new venue in a different city and didn't walk my dogs inside Meraki.   We left the dogs OUTSIDE on the patio with our hubbies and proceeded to walk inside the restaurant to place our order.  A woman who represented herself as the manager walks outside and tells us to leave because the \"HOA\" doesn't permit our dogs to sit OUTSIDE on her patio. To say the least we were confused and trying to take in the information.  We left but NOT without being shamed and humiliated.   I called in a few minutes later to voice my opinion and the story escalated to where our small dogs were being accused of \"jumping\" on a small child.  The small child and her parents approached our dogs and they happily greeted each other.   I am appalled and disheartened that an establishment in America can make people feel uncomfortable based on \"personal\" likes and judgments.   If I could rate the experience as a NEGATIVE 0, I would.    We decided to make our experience end positively and went to a ANOTHER Greek restaurant, Stephano's Greek & Mediterranea. The treatment we received was drastically different, we were welcomed and greeted with our pups.  WE ATE LUNCH on their beautiful patio and the food was fantastic!    This is in response to your recent post:  We DID NOT BRING THE DOGS INSIDE. we left them outside on the patio.  Which rules say a dog CANNOT BE ON A OUTDOOR PATIO???  In response to the owner: The manager didn't bother to ask me for my dogs identification because she was too busy making up stories about why the HOA doesn't permit dogs outside. You share your patio with the ice cream shop, does that mean you can kick me out from there too?  You're consistent in your lack of information and as a business owner in the United States of America it seems you lack in all avenues.",

The gyro had huge, thick slices of meat, fresh tzatziki sauce, and very soft, chewy pita. Kid's plate had a ton of meat, very flavorful Greek rice, sliced cucumbers and pita triangles. My wait for my to-go food was 5 or 6 minutes. The prices were very reasonable, with tip, I spent less than $20. I have found my new place for a gyro fix. Highly recommended.

The service is welcoming and the atmosphere is familial. Lately I've been getting the Niko's Street Sandwich which is perfect for a quick bite. It comes with Beef/Lamb gyro, veggies, a great spread/sauce and it's wrapped in a huge pita.  Easy 5/5, I love this place!",

Sadly, I've been too full to make it to dessert; I've had my eye on their baklava ice cream and the next time I go, I promise I'll leave room for that.

Thanks to my Yelpie friends, I looked around today and found this five star rated Greek food gold mine.  I don't give restaurants five stars unless it's a sit down place where I'm being served. Maraki is not that, but it's a nice Greek hidden gem with a relaxed atmosphere on the southwest side of town.   Walk into a clean place with many seating options. Go to the counter, give them your order, get a numbered plaque to take to your seat. The meal is delivered to you and cleared for you when finished.  I ordered the Maraki Chicken, which is a chicken breast pita sammich with large gorgeous soft juicy marinated chicken cubes, lettuce, onions and tomatoes smothered in feta cheese and taziki sauce stuffed into a thick tasty pita. Each bite tasted better than the next and there was no skimping on any ingredient.   My husband ordered the lamb burger and loved it. He also ordered feta fries on the side and oh my god. SO GOOD! Each fry was smothered in warm gooey cheese all the way to the last bite. NOMZILLA!  I would travel further distances to eat the food at Maraki, but luckily I live close by, which means I'll be going back often to taste their different menu items.  Allow me to push you towards Maraki for a delicious  Greek meal in a super casual atmosphere. Maraki is located on a corner lot in a strip mall, so parking can be tight, but don't let that scare you. This place worth it driving across town for if you have to.  Happy eating!",

    "text": "Meraki Grill is the best Greek restaurant in Las Vegas. Period. It's quickly become one of my go-to places for casual dining. I love that it's local and family-owned.   Ever since I was introduced to this place, I've found everything on their menu to be delicious and exceed expectations. Beware that their grill plates are generously huge and enough to feed two people. I love both the gyro and steak and sometimes have difficulty choosing between the two.   If you're not feeling as hungry, the gyro Meraki and the falafel pita are great alternatives. And if you end up getting a side of fries, opt for the feta fries (because you won't regret it). Save room for dessert because anything you choose will be amazing. My favorite is definitely the baklava ice cream, which is something I've never had before. It's the perfect mixture of vanilla ice cream with crunchy walnuts, layered phyllo, and honey syrup. They make this fresh as to not let the phyllo get too soggy. The rice pudding is some of the best I've had. I've yet to try the ravani or the greek yogurt, which are both next on my to-taste list.   Fairly priced, great tasting food, and amazing service. It's no wonder this place continues to receive good reviews and can afford to close for a whole week for winter break.",

I came in for the grilled octopus, but it wasn't available for lunch so I got the Jumbo Shrimp platter and the Gyro Meraki with lamb and beef. I also got the roasted eggplant spread. The shrimp platter was excellent because of the seasonings and the jumbo size shrimp along with rice and a delicious salad. The Gyro was perfect and the Eggplant spread was perfectly balanced in taste, very smooth. This place delivers consistency in fresh, healthy, and delicious meals.",

    "text": "I finally was able to try this place for a late lunch and my experience was absolutely amazing. All of the previous Yelp reviews raving about this restaurant and their food set my expectations very high and I can say that after my experience those expectations were exceeded.   Very relaxed atmosphere with plenty of open seating. We were greeted by friendly staff members who were eager to assist us in any way. Staff made sure we knew exactly what we were getting and even made some recommendations. After placing our order we were given a number and we waited for our food (maybe five or ten minutes at the most).  I ordered the falafal pita and it was amazing! The pita looked appetizing when it arrived and it did not disappoint. All of the ingredients were fresh and the falafel was delicious. They have falafal patties inside the pita that are crispy enough that you still get a crunch when eating them and they don't get soggy over time. The tzatziki was some of the best I have ever had.  Pricing and portions are good. You definitely get what you pay for here. I would highly recommend visiting this place and will definitely be back again.",

Not sure if it's family owned but there's pride in bringing fresh tasty food   I just moved around the corner from this gem, tonight was my first time in and it's everything I could have hoped for and more.   Absolutely delicious, a gyro runs you about $7.50 a la carte or $11 if you add a side and a drink. (Perfectly priced for the area)   The veggies were fresh and bursting with flavor, the juicy gyro meat is cooked just right and with lightly crispy edges. Even the pita bread was fluffy and just the right texture.  (Had the Meraki Gyro with fries and she had the Greek salad with chicken)  To top it all off patrons are all having a good time and seems like there are lots of regulars.",

It was a Tuesday night and they were packed- every table was full which really speaks volumes. We walked in and ordered our food with the attendant at the front. We had the gyro meraki and the lamb burger with an order of the feta fries. I had the gyro with chicken and it was packed with flavor (the tzatziki sauce is everything)- and I really appreciated it being wrapped perfectly and easy to eat. The lamb burger was also just as great! The feta fries though omgggg I have no words! They were crispy and salted to perfection and didn't get soggy even with the melted feta. Absolutely delicious! Will definitely be back!",

The decor of the restaurant provides more of a sunny Mediterranean ambiance.   The Meraki Gyro was delicious. While their chicken was good, I preferred their lamb and beef combination for the Greek sandwiches. In addition their gyro is much larger than any other place you'd find in town considering their pita bread was probably 9 inches in diameter.  Overall I intend to come back to try the other items on their menu, I was just too full after one gyro.",

The Meat ( Lamb/Beef ) of course is usually dry. There is something not quite right with the Tzatziki sauce. I can't put my finger ( actually Tongue ) on it. The sauce @ the annual Greek Food Festival ( which I highly recommend btw ) is by far Superior. I have eaten probably a 1,000 + Gyros in my lifetime. No I am not kidding.  The Restaurant is clean, usually packed and the prices are reasonable. The Greek Fries are just OK. I will now try some of their other food items in the near future. Hopefully they are a bit better. There are few places in Vegas that serve Gyros ( sad ). Overall 3.5 Stars from me.",

    "text": "I adore authentic Greek food, and I have recently become a regular to Meraki's! With such a large selection of Mediterranean cuisine in Las Vegas, this place is the one to choose!   The sit down is casual enough to walk-in day dressed, but formal enough to be provided great table side full service. I have always opted for take-out living extremely close, and have found my orders have been accurate and packed perfectly for transport.  The menu is extensive and all prepared authentically. They have an array of homemade dips including: tzatziki, hummus, melizanosalata, tirokafteri, taramasalata that all come served with homemade pita. I grew up loving tzatziki and hummus, but really got to expand my palette through trying their Combination of Spreads. This lets you try all the spreads for a reduced price! Tirokafteri (greek feta & spicy roasted peppers) is now my favorite after tzatkiki (I am an addict).   They have a ton of classic appetizers to chose from as well. I opt for the Mezze Plate which gives you an array of the appetizers to try if you are wanting to expand your palette. I have yet to try the Greek Toast, but fell in love with the Saganaki last time I ordered.  I always opt for the Gyro (beef/lamb) Plate because it gives you the most variety of food. Similar to the Gyro sandwich, the Gyro Plate comes with all the ingredients within the Gyro Sandwich, but just unmade (not a wrapped up sandwich). This plate also gives you an option of Greek rice or French fries. In addition to a Greek Salad, Pita and tzatziki side. I always order extra tzatziki and extra pita!  Their Quinoa is also fabulous, and I have heard good things about the Lemon Broccoli (trying this next).   They do not have Mousakka on the daily menu because it is a traditional dish that takes a lot of effort/time to prepare correctly. I did hear the owner tell someone they will make it an upcoming special due to the demand/desire! This excited me immensely.   For desserts you cannot go wrong at Meraki's! The Baklava is so flaky and cooked to perfection. I could consume two slices myself. The ratio of nut to honey is marvelous. The Ravani was also very good, and the Mama's Rice Pudding was a close second. The Baklava ice cream is also very good, but did not transport the best with all the hot food.   Overall, YUM YUM YUM. Now I want greek food and its 8:00 a.m.   Must go!! New Greek favorite in LV.    A+",

The waitress that is rubbing her nose turns and looks at my order and turns her back to it. The other waitress starts to get my food ready has the two waitresses start gossiping about something. I am really starting to get frustrated because it is taking longer to get my food ready because if there gossiping. The waitress finally brings me my order but because they were so distracted on other things the desert I ordered was not in the bag and I had to wait longer for that to be ready. With the flu virus going around you would think employees would be required to use frequent hand washing but I this isn't the case here I'm just glad the girl that kept rubbing here nose never touched my food",

We have a family with a picky eater, a vegan, and one with a lot of food allergies. We all were super happy and safe here. The gal at the counter was so kind and took her time to explain the best options for us.  Everyone working there seemed glad to be working there and appeared happy to make us happy.  Boy, were we happy! I had the quinoa bowl and added falafel. The teenager had the kids chicken plate with rice.  The husband had the falafel sandwich.  The other teen had fries and a side of falafel.  That was enough to keep us full for the rest of the day.   The price for the four of us was quite reasonable. I wish that this place was closer to LA because I would go often if it was.",

The portions are generous and delicious. The food is well-plated--it looks very pretty on silver platters with clean white wrappings. As soon as the waitress set down our plates my husband commented on the bright red tomatoes, and they were delicious! The small salad was perfectly dressed--some Greek restaurants put on dressing that is too strong or too heavy, but this was just right! All five of us really enjoyed our food, and the child's plate was more than enough food for our 10-yr-old. Thankful we found a new place to eat!",

    "text": "So how to write this review...I just left there and got home.   Let me start with the good and end with the bad....  The food was as everyone's review states... Amazing!!! It was delicious!!! I had the beef and lamb gyro and it was very flavorful without being too heavily spiced. The tzazicki sauce on it was dead on... Hint of acid from the yogurt and lemon just added to the entire bite with the crunchy from the thinly sliced red onions... It was delicious!!! 5/5  I also upgraded my gyro into a combo by getting a drink and getting the upgraded feta fries. Drink was a drink but it was disappointing that they had no low calorie drinks in the machine... So the only thing that I found to drink was the sparkling water. The feta fries on the other hand was so good!! Perfectly crunchy and perfectly seasoned with the feta cheese just starting to melt into the fries. Totally delish and worth the .79 upgrade. 5/5  I also got the mezze plate (pretty wording for a sampler plate of their appetizers)....Uuuuummmmm yes I was hungry and I wanted to try alot of items so that I would know what to get for the next time.   :D  Everything on there was delicious. The spanakopita was OMG delicious! One of the best I've ever had. The pastry was so freaking flaky...I think I could have inhaled like 20 of them...Lol falafel.... Delicious!!! Perfectly crunchy on the outside and just the right amount of chew on the inside. Dolmadakia was very flavorful as well... And it was served room temperature so the flavor just came rushing out when I bit into it. So good!!! Pretty much everything on there was amazing.  5/5  Ambiance was very nice. The tables and chairs added a touch of fine dining feeling to the entire place. They definitely were not the cheapo tables and chairs. The place was very open and inviting... The only con to the table set up was that the tables are set up a little too close to each other so that when a large table came in and sat down next to me and my bf, it felt very very crowded... To the point that we had to move to a different booth table on the wall. (4/5)  So if the food was omg amazing and the ambiance was nice... Why the 3 star review?   It all comes down to service. When you are a new restaurant in town it's not nice to make your guests feel less then comfortable in your establishment.  The tall skinny guy that took my order was very friendly and he was the only person in that restaurant to touch my table. Mind you there was another older woman walking around delivering food and chatting with the guests. Well she was chatting to all the guests that were white or Greek. Let me explain. I was sitting on the booth side... Right by the entrance was a family of 4 Asians... Then a table of 2 white people then me and my bf... Then another table of 2 white people with a child. The older woman talked with the couple of both sides of me and totally by passed my table. Then she went onto talking to pretty much all the other tables in the dining room except the 2 Asian tables. Maybe I'm being overly sensitive??? But I don't think so. There was another girl taking orders and she pretty much stayed to the middle part of the dining room... BUT if you are new and asking people if the food is good... Shouldn't you ASK everyone?? You can't just look at me and say oh she's Asian so she doesn't know Greek/middle Eastern food at all. I have worked in a fine dining middle Eastern restaurant in the kitchen so yes I do know my flavors and I do know my food well... Excuse the rant but their attitude rather intentional or not just left me with a bad taste in my mouth.   Was the food amazing??? Heck yeah it was... Will I return.... Most likely not... The service was just disappointing. Besides the intentional or not racism mentioned above, you can't deliver food without silverware and napkins. No I didn't want a share plate but yes I need napkins when I'm eating and silverware is always necessary when you eat.",

It's obvious that this is a family owned business and they pay attention to detail. Nothing fancy you go up to a counter and order and sit down they will bring you your food. The best of course, is the egg and lemon soup which is second to none. It appears to be a family recipe I can't be duplicated. If you go in lunchtime you'll have to wait. But it's worth the wait. Dinnertime can also be busy but that just goes to show you how popular the place is. They are closed on Monday. I guess they need to rest.",

    "text": "The other day a girl friend and I were having a girl's and while getting pedicures I had mentioned to her I thought Greek food sounds good for lunch. She mentioned that there was a new place that just opened up near by. She sent me the link for Yelp. I checked it over and it looked good.   The place has plenty of parking, and there was a good rush of people there for lunch. My friend and I decided on a lot of different items to try. The prices are very reasonable. We had no idea the portion sizes were so plentiful but a happy surprise. I did hear the cashier mention they had only been open about a month and half. You could tell they were still working out some of the new things with register but we're still very quick.   Unfortunately my friend forgot to pick up her number or a receipt and all my food came out quickly but hers didn't. She did order before I did. Once we figured out what happened they were very quick to get the food out. We had stuffed ourselves on pita bread, but did get to try everything before having to pack it up to go.   Loved the Gyro with lamb and the Tzatziki. So yummy and hit the spot. Loved how fresh everything was. You get a very Greek feel once inside as well. A very good experience and definitely would go back.",

You walk into Meraki facing a fast food counter and menu but immediately feel the packed surroundings. Locals come out in droves but pay a little attention and you'll quickly see the Greeks and Armenians occupying the tables around fantastic food presentations.   The menu has a little bit of everything although the notable absence of Moussaka from the menu is regretful. I ordered the chicken skewer with rice and salad and it was simply fantastic. The lamb burger is also in a class of its own.   Portions are generous and prices are great value. But it's the freshness and quality of the food that stand out, as well as the friendly service. This will become a regular stop for me.",

The lettuce look more like ice bergs than romaine lettuce and the olive still had the pit in it, that's makes it more work and a tooth hazard. I wasn't wow about the hummus but I have to be fair it was my first time trying hummus. They had a soda machine but most of all there selection was out.  Response to the owner:  there was no warning. Not from your cashier or on your menu. I check! You can change it  now though.  I had plenty of Greek salads and never had the olive with the pit in it. But you're welcome!  Revised for the owner comment: when I wrote that I check your menu before I did. It's very easy to change your menu after the fact. But I'm glad you have a disclaimer now, but you should spend those extra dollars to get the olives without the pits. It's better business. Thanks for the update! I still wouldn't go back.",

The lettuce is so crisp and the tomato's are the best tasting tomatoes! I have also tried the lamb burger- bomb, lemon rice soup- delicious, and lamb kabobs and rice are good too, the rice has a hint of lemon flavor. Oh and the taziki sauce is the best hands down. I eat there a few times a week and I will continue to do so! Thank you for offering such delicious and healthy food options!",

(yesterday actually)   With their cool sign outside their spot.. i was a little hesitant because i thought this place would be super expensive.. but to my surprise, as soon as i looked their prices.. I was shocked that it was actually reasonably priced!  I also thought by looking from the outside that this place was probably a fine dining restaurant (you never know here in Vegas) - and again i was surprised when i walked in... - it was very casual and I felt very comfortable.   I ordered the steak from the grill.. cooked to medium.. and i don't know what they did in the kitchen but that steak was absolutely perfect! It really worked well with the other items i had on my plate (salad, rice, and pita) - i could probably eat that steak by itself all day! Delicious!  My wife got the meraki signature bowl and added their salmon to it.. presentation on both dishes made our mouths instantly drool.. taste quality on everything on the dish was great - salad tasted fresh.. balance of flavors bursting out with every bite.. so good!!!  They got an awesome soda machine that you can literally spend minutes cycling through all their selections - fancy! but hurry up please because there is only one machine per person..   overall - this place is awesome.. the staff was very nice and always smiling.. the place was clean.. the ambiance was good.. there was a couple tvs on the wall - mirrors to make the place look bigger than it actually is.. plenty of lighting to get your photo on.. and the drinks were cold! I'll be back for sure!  ENJOY!",

I'm also a big fan of The Great Greek in Henderson and didn't know that this place is just the same - just now in the Southwest area. This is a fast casual counter service restaurant. We came in around 4 pm and line was pretty long but food came out quick right after we placed our orders. We ordered the lamb and chicken gyro meraki + made it a combo w/ feta fries. I hardly eat fries but feta fries is a must here w/ the gyros. Great flavors throughout. Portions are huge to finish it all in a single sitting (we came in starving too). Meraki & The Great Greek would be my top choices for Greek/Mediterranean food or want something very fresh.",

Which shows me most people think this place is great! :) I think eventually they will need to expand or get a second location.   I came across this little gem while on the hunt for new places to eat. I need to remind myself to try other things on the menu. I always get the traditional gyro plate \"from the grill\" section. The portions are big so if you are a light eater you can share it with someone. It comes with the beef/lamb meat mix, a salad, and rice. I like to substitute the rice for the yummy garlic feta fries! They are to die for!",

    "text": "Absolute crap! Brought appetizers at same time with main courses! When asked, they said it's the way they do it, which is BS! I watched the platter sit for 10 minutes! He asked what we wanted to do with it and I told him to take it back and give us refund. He was not happy about that!   Another guy came up to ask if we are the ones wanting a refund. I said yes and also showed him my steak skewer that it was cooked very well, he said he would be right back! Supposed to be medium!   After 10 minutes of nothing, I wave down a young lady and asked for a manager. She said the manager is in the back and how can she help us. I repeated myself saying that I want to the manager!  The manager came out and I explained to her the appetizer platter situation and the service along with it and then the overcooked steak and the fact that no one offered a replacement or anything else to eat!  She said she would take it off the bill. About five minutes later a guy came up and threw the check on our table and walked away without saying a word.  The receipt we were provided did not make sense for the refund, so I went up to ask what it was. What they provided was a receipt for the items we paid for, and not for the refund.  I also asked him a question regarding the feta fries! I asked him if there is another cheese mixed in with the feta and he said yes, there's mozzarella! I asked him why they don't call the dish with feta and mozzarella fries in case somebody's allergic to cheese outside of feta. He snickered and walked away...  To sum it all up, the food likes flavor and the service lacks everything!",

Good lord I could eat a bucket of these!  I ordered the chicken plate with the side of feta fries.  The plate consisted of two (large) chicken skewers, a salad with a light dressing, pita bread, and tzatziki (Greek cucumber yogurt).  The plate was large enough to share between my girlfriend and I, and was very much enjoyable.  There's plenty of indoor seating and plenty of parking outside.    Dip the chicken in the tzatziki. Dip the pita bread in the tzatziki. Hell, dip the fries in the tzatziki.  Everything tastes good.  JUST DO IT.",

This place is a casual dining place where you order at the counter, and they will bring you the food. People here are pretty friendly. Service is decent for  this kind of setting. I like the all window bright design here. It makes the place very clean and energetic.   I have tried both beef and chicken kalamakia plates with fries and rice. I like their fries and rice a lot. The rice is flavored just right. The fries is crispy and nicely seasoned. I couldn't have enough of their fries! The beef and chicken qualities are both good, although I like their chicken one a little better. The pita bread here is quite good as well. My only complaint was that sometimes the salad was over seasoned. Feta cheese fries is so yummy. You should definitely order it!   I highly recommend anyone who enjoys a nice plate of kabob and rice/fries to come and try it out!",

The food would be ordered from the register and brought to table when it's done. And it's done FAST considering how busy the restaurant was at the time we were there.   I got Traditional Gyro plate and Hummus Pitas as appetizer. Hummus was REALLY creamy and it was not too salty which I loved. My sister also got a side of rice, which is so flavorful and has a hint of milky silky flavor to it. I was obsessed with it!  However, the lamb didn't really live up to the rice. The meat was a bit on a dry side, which I'm not sure if it was how the dish was supposed to be. I like the flavor of the steak and chicken on my brother's and sister's plate better, so maybe next time I'll get that instead.",

This is my favorite Greek spot in town (outside of Greek Fest weekend) and I look forward to coming back again and again.  The restaurant itself feels open and bright with many windows, and they have outdoor setting.  The food is what you need to come here for though. The lemon soup with chicken and rice in it is one of my favorite items. It's hearty, but not heavy, and light but also filling. The lemon is not overpowering, but perfect and the ratio of chicken and rice to soup is just right. I also quite enjoy the gyro though this past time I chose to go with the lamb burger which was cooked perfectly, juicy and tender, and sandwiched between a soft bun, feta, arugula, tomato, and red onion.   I plan on coming back (hopefully soon) to continue eating my way through the menu because there is just so much to try and I want it all.",

I searched Yelp & saw Meraki was close by so I decided to check it out.  I was greeted in a friendly & prompt manner.  I ordered the chicken rice lemon soup to-go.  When I got back to my hotel, I saw that fresh pita bread was included.  Yum!!  I ended up just eating just  1/2 the sandwich and instead the soup & pita became my main meal.  They seem to focus on quality and good service.  I look forward to going back again while in town to try other items.",

When the village greek salad and the Meraki Bowl with baby beets arrived, we knew we had made a Great choice. The salad and bowl were heaven.

I was taken by surprise when my party arrived and it was fast casual counter service. They were very busy when we arrived. I'm talking not an empty seat in the house kind of busy, so I figured they probably had forgotten about us.   Queue lovely employee putting tables together, wiping them down, and placing a Reserved sign right in the center of the table. I walked right over and introduced myself and the table was ours!  The owner was behind the counter taking orders, she first let us know the food would take about 20 minutes and she and I chatted about her history in the restaurant business while she rang me up. She owns this spot with her son *awe* and they have been open 3 months.  I got the Village Greek and added a chicken skewer. Tomato, red onion, cucumber, feta, kalamata olives, pepperocini with a Greek vinaigrette. A few slices of pita bread. The flavors were so fresh and the chicken was tender and packed with flavor. I'd recommend doubling up on the meat with this salad.   No matter how long the line is here, if the food keeps coming out this good, I'm in.  My only question is, Why didn't I try the hummus?!",

A far as food goes, I had the Meraki gyro with beef/lamb and was thoroughly full.  Thick pita and tasty meat.  A little too much tzatziki sauce but delicious nonetheless.  I coupled that with a side of hummus which was some of the best in town.  My entire meal came at about $10.

There are a few passable places, but I usually wait until I am in ORD and I go to the Parthenon in Greek Town. This is superb, high quality food. I wasn't expecting much and ordered the Meraki Signature bowl. Everything was delicious. I couldn't finish it, but it was so good I wanted to take it home. Before I could ask, the attentive family service staff asked if I wanted a small takeout container. My husband ordered the lamb/beef gyro with feta fries. He inhaled it. He was as impressed as I was. We ordered baklava for takeout because of the other reviews. This one is a keeper.  Please visit soon!!! They must succeed. I have waited over 20 years for this.",

The chicken plate came with fresh pita bread, salad and I upgraded my fries to feta fries.  The children's chicken plate meal came with one side so I ordered rice and it came with cucumber and tomato and tzakai sauce.  Their hummus is the best I have ever tasted, it was so fresh and perfect. As I am typing...I want more.Lol. It looks family owned and they were very nice to us.  It was very clean as well which is a must.  They also had very nice decor.  I would recommend trying this place out. I will definitely be going back again.",

I was not planning on going combo route but happy they made suggestion. I went with the soup. The soup was great! It different. I was thinking close to creamy chicken and rice soup. It has a hint of citrus flavor but overall nice hearty soup not heavy creamy base soup. Refreshing compliment with Gyro Classico. The Gryro meat was delicious. I could just eat Gyro all day one of my favorite dishes for Greek food. You get nice size portion of Gyro wrapped in nice pita bread. Fill it out with the sauce, tomato, cucumber, and red onion. It perfect balance between flavor, texture, and great dish. I also ordered Hummus start. Amazing. It had great depth of flavor. The consistency was the perfect balance garlic and garbanzo beans. The warm pita bread served on the side dip it in. Another Greek favorite for me could eat all day everyday. So much more to the menu only tapped the surface. I look forward to future visits because the desserts sounds amazing. I just need make sure leave room for desserts.  The interior talk about impressive for small restaurant. You would never guess from the outside. It located right off rainbow in not even strip mall but four or five restaurants all next to one another. It looks more industrial building then made for restaurants. Meraki they do fabulous job of putting their own personality into the restaurant. The minute walk in playing ethic Greek music or assume it is cause I know playing nothing hear on the radio. The photos around the inside display the art and culture of Greek life. The tables and chairs, booths along the sides, and everything new cause before never been restaurant business in that spot. It provides great vibe just chill over great meal.   The service was five stars all day. I love the fact tell family run business. They care about each and every customer. I look forward to coming back try some of the bowls and again the desserts.",

What do you get when you take a former chef at Milo's at the Cosmopolitan, and the family of the original owner's at Vegas' most highly lauded The Great Greek restaurant? The answer, pure magic. And that magic is at Meraki.  Will Meraki take over the title of best Greek restaurant in Vegas? Absolutely. It's already won me over. The food is damn good.  Had the Gyro Meraki with the Beef/Lamb. Tender, well seasoned, and just straight up delicious. From the pita to the garnishes, everything was on point. Everything was fresh and well prepared, and the sauces were exceptional.   I'll be back, really great food. This place may be the best Greek restaurant in Vegas, I'll have to admit it.   Yyyyyyeeeessss, the spot.",

    "text": "Executive Summary:  Heard about Meraki but this was our 1st time in.  Delicious Greek Food at a very reasonable price. Huge portions, wonderful service, excellent value and the Grill is very clean.  I am Greek and grew up on this food.  Meraki does an excellent job of preparation, presentation, value and service!  Well worth stopping in.  We are locals here.  We eat out every single day and often twice a day. We recognize that the restaurant business is a difficult and tricky business to achieve success in. We eat in divey out of the way places and in high end restaurants (think Hank's in GVR).  It is with this in mind we write reviews.  Meraki is exochos - Excellent - a small, very clean, well managed place in a small mall.  The menu is extensive offering wonderful choices that they will adjust to suit your tastes.  Really the best tasting Greek I've had here in town.  Agapoun afto pou kanoun kai to kanoun kala - They love what they do and they do it well.  We were greeted by a lovely young lady, Stephanie, who was engaged, energetic, passionate about the food, helpful with selections and recommendations and full of laughter.  She did a great job of helping us select because we couldn't simply do what we wanted and take one of everything.  Our order arrived quickly. It was really big, no skimping on the portions. Everything was prepared perfectly right down to the tzatziki that was not runny or merely yogurt but instead flavorful and delicious.  I had a large plate that was full of amazing rice, fresh salad and chicken skewers. The Boss had a Greek Salad wrap (big) with Shrimp.  The spanakopita was tasty (although tiny by my family's standards - each piece of ours was easily an inch thick growing up - a little unrealistic for a restaurant but I was hoping).    For desert we ordered 1 piece of Baklava - it was HUGE for $5 and it was thick and delicious!  From Stephanie to the menu to the value and service to the excellent fresh tasty food to the comfortable and clean interior, we would highly recommend Meraki to you.",

I could eat a whole pint in one sitting and top it off with some of their incredible rice pudding and die in a happy little diabetic coma.   Honestly all of the food here is killer. They must have a spartan chef because they take no prisoners. From their light and delicious lemon rice, to their fresh and crisp salad to the delicately spiced kabobs this place is legendary, much like Alexander the Great! I sound like a bad advertisement (come on, though, who doesn't love food jokes), but my praise is off the charts. The dolmas are amazing and you can taste that they use good quality olive oils. Their dips are also packed full of delicious flavor. My favorite is the Tirokafteri. It packs an amazing and spicy punch.  Their staff always treats us like valued customers. they are genuinely warm and friendly.   We usually dine out, but their dining room is cute and modern as well.   This is my go to Greek in Vegas.

    "text": "Enter the magical Grecian Era: mERAki. The time? that moment you drive through the barren Nevada desert and the only thing on your mind is the crunch of cool cucumbers and the acidity of the ripen tomatoes against the juicy souvlaki meat. The place? over the (south) Rainbow (Blvd). I'm not making this stuff up...   Meraki, a word of apt Greek origin, is an adjective apparently difficult to translate, but is associated with doing something from the heart - with soul, creativity, and love. The spirit of Meraki is infused in every bite; every sip; and every swirl of offering at this casual restaurant situated on the far right corner of the plaza under the blue awning.   My favorites?    (1) Baklava Ice Cream. While I usually begin with savory delights, the highlight of my meal here is actually dessert - a deconstructed Baklava intertwined into vanilla ice cream. This may be the best Greek dessert I've consumed to date. The crunch of the Baklava flakes and nuttiness of the walnut/pistachio and cinnamon flavors melded with the vanilla ice cream and made every bite unique in its own right.   Note 1: If you're thinking of trying the Ravani (a sweet semolina cake with fresh citrus zest), I would divert the funds and order more Baklava Ice Cream - it's really the best. The Ravani tastes like a citrus pound cake.   (2) The Gyro Meraki. The Gyro Meraki comes in both beef/lamb and chicken variants. It consists of a bed of juicy beef/lamb or chicken, freshly diced tomatoes, crunchy cool lettuce, goat milk Feta and shreds of red onion rolled into a freshly warmed pita bread with creamy tzatziki spread. The chicken was a bit on the dry side - the beef/lamb is probably the better between the two options.   Note 2: If you're scratching your head wondering what the difference between Gyro Meraki and Gyro Classico is, let me save you some time. They're the same except Gyro Meraki has added Feta and Lettuce - it is so worth the extra 84 cents.   (3) Mezze Plate. When gathering with friends, I my go to is usually the Mezze Plate, which allows you to sample bits of everything. While the Feta - tomato- cucumber village salad was very crunchy, cool and fresh (the highlight of the dish), the remainder of the plate was not as impressive as other Mezze Plates. It contained 2 pieces of falafel, 2 spanakopitas, 2 dolmasakias, and a not so generous serving of each tzatziki and hummus. There was not enough pita and it seems the falafel and spanakopitas could've benefited from being served hotter. Nonetheless, the plate was still enjoyable.   Meraki, you're a Greek Merakle existent on a Rainbow Road to happiness.",

It was our first time so even if it was in the menu its should also be part of their job to offer and recommend other choices that they think was suited to the customers.Ur cashier was so busy looking us from head to toe like she was above us.Not friendly at all.Very impatient.Has she not been busy giving us her long face while we were ordering maybe we could have read the menu better and talk to her more about what are the best food in the menu she can recommend us.Also how can ur receipt not print the ordered items in the menu both paper and digital?Directly just showed total and tax. No breakdown of items.Its totally not worth our 30 dollars something.We tried other places like shish kabob,mad greek cafe,fat greek,shawarma plus etc. and we didnt have any experience like what we had in ur establishment.Food was not good either so dont be to proud.Dont say sorry if u dont mean it and u have to justify.Ur the only one in yelp that replied this way with a bad review.Like ur so defensive and in denial with the truth that was going on with ur business.U cant be perfect so dont try to.U werent even there when we were there.Maybe if u were we could have complain directly to u with our our unhappy experienced. So u didnt see the utensils that was wrapped with a dirty napkin with dried tomato seed stains they served us, that also smelled so bad. Im just really honest its nothing personal with me as ur customer and u as the owner.I wish ur business goodluck and that it will hopefully change in the future for the better.This review like mine should encourage you and make ur business grow and develop well for u and all ur customers.Use it as motivation.Dont worry my neighbors,family,friends and coworkers will really know about all of this and each one of them will spread it to everybody they know as well. So u didnt just lose me as a customer.We dont deserve that experience it was awful..Lastly I never said u guys are serving ur customers week old pita bread but what I said was my pita bread was like a week old bread because it was too hard and my chicken was cold.",

First thing on my way home was to look up restaurants and this one was the closest and I do love Greek so here we go for Greek.  What a treat!  It's not a big restaurant and only few tables for seating outside.   You have to put your order in and then seat yourself.   The waitress will bring you your order.   I had the chicken plate with rice and a salad. Can I tell you this plate would feed three people.  The chicken shish-kebob was so tender and tasty it was great. Salad fresh and dressed just perfectly.  Everything was wonderful   Only thing is this restaurant is not the best for large groups at the busy times of the day because you cannot reserve seating and it's not a large restaurant",

    "text": "Had just arrived in Vegas and after a three hour or so drive through the desert, you get kind of hungry. I was really in the mood for Mediterranean food so I looked up what was close. Yelp did me a solid and steered me towards Meraki Greek Grill.  Meraki is located in a strip mall right off of Rainbow Blvd with a couple of other restaurants. You walk inside and into a simple dining set-up with the menu straight ahead. The menu is loaded with Greek goodness from meat plates to salads to kabobs and even a burger. I went and ordered the Mezze appetizer plate and a half gyro/half chicken combo plate with feta fries in place of rice. It was a ton of food. The mezze plate had Greek salad, falafel, hummus, tzakiki with pitas for dipping. Everything was freshly made and absolutely delicious. The gyro/chicken plate was even better. Generous portions of lamb and a chicken skewer along with more salad and pita. The feta cheese was melted onto the fries. So good.  Service was friendly and very good. This is a \"fastuarant\" style establishment in once you order, everything is brought to your table. The food was sent out quickly. For as fresh as everything was, I couldn't believe it. If I'm in Vegas and I have the same craving for Mediterranean food, I'll be heading to Meraki Greek Grill. Checks all the boxes for a five star review from me. Highly recommended!",

    "text": "Great food at very reasonable prices! My friend told me about Meraki so I just had to try it out. The portions are huge and the prices are wallet friendly.   I had the bowl which consisted of really fresh veggies, delicious rice, yummy garbanzo beans, and honestly some of the best gyro meat I've had in awhile. I find gyro meat to be hit or miss a lot of the time because it's either over cooked and cut too thin or cut too thick and soggy. I like my gyro meat with a little crunch on the outside but still nice and juicy throughout. Meraki does it just right.   Their tsatziki is delicious.    The falafel was enjoyable. Really great flavors thoughout.   The spanakopita was a miss for me. I prefer the kind that's layered in almost a lasagna fashion. There's is just a triangular puff pastry with a tasteless spinach concoction inside.   Must get the fries! So good!  Overall, for the quality of the food and the value, I think Meraki is a good choice for Greek / Mediterranean",

It means, to me anyway, that you are serving good food that's reasonably priced.  We decided to order our food to go, even after being told it would take about 20 minutes. That was understandable because there were a few customers ahead of us who just ordered and some customers were just finding their seats.  We ordered two of the Traditional Gyro Plate with beef & lamb mix, Greek rice, Greek salad, pita bread, and Tzatziki. And one of the Gyro Classico Burger with beef & lamb mix, tomatoes, red onions, and Tzatziki.  Well worth the wait! We each had a delicious dinner at home. I believe that even the Greek gods approve of their deliciousness!  We will definitely come back...for the sweet desserts of Baklava Ice Cream and Mama's Rice Pudding!",

Being a chef and having owned Greek fast food restaurants in NY I can tell you Meraki rivals the best and closest thing or maybe even better than being in Greece . The gyro is made there and is excellent.  The lamb burger is a must try and off the charts too. If you have room left you must have the ravani cake, made with semolina and syrup, like my mother made and their homemade Baklava ice cream. Awesome. My favorite place!",

While my husband went up to order I went to sit at the only open table and was told I couldn't sit until we had a number. I also have rheumatoid arthritis and fibromyalgia so it's really nice I have to stand, but what got me is then the lady that told me that greets the lady and her husband behind me who mind you hadn't even gotten in line yet  let alone placed their order, and gives her a table she just cleared. So that defeats the whole purpose of what she had just told me! Then at the counter we are told you can get it to go or we'll hold your food up to 20 minutes for a table to open. Of all of the gyro places out there I will not give my business to anyone who doesn't appreciate it. I have never felt like such an after thought at any business I have tried to patronize! They are very rude and act like they are doing you a favor to let you grace their presence. How this place has 5 stars with customer service like that is beyond me.",

We ordered the hummus, the steak plate with rice and a beef gyro with feta fries. Everything tasted delicious! High quality food for sure. We love hummus and theirs did not disappoint. The gyro meat had so much flavor and the veggies and sauces tasted amazing together. The steak kabobs were so tender that it was easy to cut with our butter knives. It came with some home made tzatziki sauce which we dipped the meat in. The Greek salad was good. The rice was very good. The fries were also good but next time we probably wouldn't get them since we ordered too much food. The steak plate is a pretty big portion. We saw the people next to us with the gyro plate and it looked really good so we'll probably get that next time. We're going back for the food, not the service. Hopefully they're a little nicer next time...",

    "text": "I had been hearing CONSTANT noise about this restaurant for the past week. I passed it by on several occasions because I'm not a huge Greek foodie. Finally, I had to try it. So many great reviews couldn't be wrong. And they weren't. This was by far more than I expected it to be. The menu is massive for such a quaint restaurant. By no means is it a small place, but it feels so warm, friendly and inviting when you walk in. You can make combination upon combination of entrees with this menu! Tried the hummus (Appetizer; $4.49) and it was DELICIOUS! This one was so fresh and flavorful for being so simple. I love hummus and they do it right. Then, my boyfriend and I each got the \"From the Grill\" Gyro plate ($12.95), after the cashier suggested that since it was our first time there. I got mine over rice and my boyfriend had his with the feta fries. The plate is gigantic for one person, so we had to take half of each home to enjoy later. The feta fries are AMAZING and I'm not even a feta fan! The rice was so fluffy and full of flavor, too. The plate comes with a heaping pile of the Gyro meat (beef/lamb), a nice big salad and side of pita bread. More than enough for one person! The staff is wonderful, friendly, smiley and offers help if you're not sure of what to get. Couldn't have asked for a better dining *first* experience. We will be back time and time again!",

I watched my food sit and get cold before i finally asked about my meal, and low and behold it was finally discovered and served to me. I said this to the lady as she handed me the bag (i saw upon my arrival), and was given a lackluster 'sorry'. Maybe if the staff member was present, paying attention to all people, rather than discussing past/future tasks, moving quicker to serve others happily while glossing over others like me (watched 2 guests jump others in line while I waited), I wouldn't be using this platform right now to voice my frustration and enjoying a cold cut gyro. Cherry on top... No utensils or napkins! Bad night Meraki, maybe next time.",

Their Avgolemono soup ( traditional chicken soup with rice and lemon) is to die for. That alone is worth the trip. They also have roasted beets that are unbelievably fresh and tasty.

    "text": "I was so happy when I found out the previous owners of The Great Greek in Hendo set up shop here at Meraki. Bonus points for being on the West side of town. I LOVE the food, and apparently so does everyone else. Every time I have been in, it's been packed. I would not recommend going during lunch because you will wait a long time. Even though I have an hour, I've had to shovel my food down quickly because it is that busy. It is also pretty small so it's hard to find a table. On our last visit we were able to snag a table, but I felt claustrophobic because the line to order was right next to our table. Next time I will probably order to-go.  I really like the signature bowls here. They are full of flavor and semi-healthy depending on the protein you add. A bowl sets you back $11 and protein is an extra $3-4.  I usually get steak or gyro, but they also have chicken and shrimp. I also enjoy the gyro and the avgolemono soup. The feta fries are tasty as well. As long as they keep making delicious food, I will keep coming back!",

Meat is more tasty and tender than anywhere else I've had a gyro in Vegas and probably anywhere.   They give nice portions and it should fill you up.  Pita bread they put it in is warm and delicious.  Sprung for the feta fries for the extra 79 cents and I am ecstatic they took my money and gave me the upgraded fries.   79 cents have never been so well spent.  Super tasty and highly recommend them.    The place is very nice, clean and the staff is super friendly.  Bathroom was immaculate.  I wouldn't think of going to another Greek place instead of here.  No way!!!    Soft drink selection is extensive from the tap and flavorful the right way.   Sometimes soda just doesn't taste right.  Not an issue here.    Waiting for the baklava ice cream as we speak.   From what the other reviews say, it's a game changer.",

Meraki has traditional Greek cuts, always tender, robust and basted with lemon, Greek olive oil and various herbs.  They offer classic gyros and are always spot on!  The Greek spreads such as tzatziki are always consistent and hit the spot!

I just recently started the keto diet, so I liked that they had some options available. I had the meraki bowl with no rice, no beans, easy tomatoes and olives on the side (I don't like olives) with their gyro meat. It was delicious! All the flavors mixed very well together and made my taste buds scream of joy. My boyfriend ordered the lamb burger and feta fries. He said it was very tender and rich in flavor. And it was way more than filling. He didn't care too much for the fries, but they were still good nonetheless. He liked dipping them in my tzatziki.   Overall it was very good food and a great experience. We'll be back when we're on this side of town, most definitely :)",

Along with the gyro, we always order a side of feta fries to split and that is more than enough for the two of us to get full.  We used to work with Chef Niko, and he was kind enough to send out a scoop of baklava ice cream on one occasion, and rice pudding on another.  BOTH WERE SO GOOD.

Solid yelp five\" I lobby.  \"Awww, I was kinda feeling something else\" whines Midwest poker dude.  \"How about that pho place with the soft tendons and killer blood cakes?\" I loudly announce to my Asian car-mates.  \"No, no, Greek sounds great!\" his immediate reply.  From the original owners of the Great Greek, comes another blockbuster of a casual Greek eatery.  Fragrant spices and herbs, zesty lemons, peppery olive oil, feta cheese, warm pitas, flavorful lamb and beef. What's not to love? Oh, you order it all at a counter.  Great selection of spreads.  The hummus stands out with its silky smooth texture, earthy sesame, pleasant acidity from fresh lemon and a good dousing of olive oil.  The Melizanosalata (roasted eggplant, think tabolui) equally good.  Zero bitterness or acrid, burnt notes.   Taziki displays perfect sour notes of the yogurt offset by sulfurous, warming garlic and vegetal cucumber.  Tip: all five spreads offered can be sampled on the combination plate.  For \"solid\" food, the spanakopita (layers of crispy phylo surrounding wilted baby spinach and feta cheese) very good.  Little crispy packets of creamy, vegetal goodness. The saganaki (fried block of kefalograviera cheese), also a winner.  Texturally, it's similar to that of fried mozzarella with a hint of sourness. Eat it as soon as you get it.  So good ripping hot and stretched around a fork.  For mains, in general, well flavored Beef and lamb, all cooked well, sliced thin and not dry.  Typical but good gyro fillers.  The lamb burger, oh yeah.  Ground lamb, very well seasoned, covered in a pile of melting feta and topped with Greek salad dressed greens, good eats.  Counter service is very friendly.  The seating area, clean. Portions are large, prices very fair.  I suspect several repeat visits will be made throughout the WSOP.  Looking forward to trying some of their grilled specials and fingers crossed, octopus.  Highly recommended.",

I keep getting the Meraki signature bowl because I love the chopped salad and veggies with gyro meat on top. I felt the gyro was sliced paper thin and dried out a bit one time I went. The next time it was cut thicker and better that way. My dining companions usually get the plates and it's a large amount of food. The last visit I had the avgolemono soup which I enjoyed. I tried steak on my salad the last time and it didn't have much flavor but wasn't bad, I just prefer the gyro. I'm going to try the different proteins before I decide on my favorite. Their tzatziki sauce is the best!!! I don't get excited about fries but I love theirs. The baklava ice cream is worth the calories. It seems very family oriented each time I've gone in which is great.   Now if I can get myself to try something different the next time I go.

    "text": "Thanks again Yelpers for a great suggestion. It's very cute inside, with little pots that have live plants on every table. Even though it was crowded, the place was spotless. You order at the counter and they bring your food to the table. Orders take a little while but you soon know why when you see the quality of the food. They also space the orders correctly. If you get an appetizer it doesn't come out all at once with the main and dessert. These are nice touches that many less casual places don't get.  First of all, everything tastes fresh, like they don't cut the tomatoes until you order your burger fresh. We had the lamb burger with feta fries and an eggplant dip appetizer with pita bread. Friends had the gyro with tzatziki and hummus with pita bread. We cross-sampled and all of it was of the same high quality. The food looks like the photos on the review page. Next time we go (and this spot is now on the dinner wheel), we'll try to get some of that semolina cake. Just wish they weren't so far from us (live on east side).... But that won't stop us going! :)",

One of the tastiest dish I have ever had at a restaurant. The next best thing to the amazing dishes at Meraki hands down is there service. They go over and beyond with every customer who walked in. The employees were so genuinely happy and very uplifting. Harry greeted everyone with a smile and treated each customer as if he knew them his whole life. It was my first time and he guided me through some of the top dishes. I highly recommend this place. (Ahh Man writing this review has me craving that LAMB BURGER again. So YUMMY!!!)",

Got a second bowl to take home. Shrimp plate has ten huge shrimp. Feta fries have lots of feta. Baklava was incredible. Ate the whole thing in multiple sittings. Will definitely be back.",

The lamb chops were I think $34.00 expensive for the type of restaurant but perfectly cooked and seasoned to perfection! The only thing lacking is customer service, once you order and pay your on your own unless you happen to ask a owner/manager for help, for that reason I no longer tip when I pay but the service will not keep me away the food is super fresh, hot and delicious a real surprise since it's order at the counter and nothing fancy about the space kind of place.",

It makes excellent an understatement! We had salads, chicken kabobs and gyros. It was fresh, tasty and delicious. We had a great slice of semolina cake soaked in honey and some Armenian coffee. The place is ultra casual. You have to go up to the counter to order and they bring the food to your table. The friendliest people you'll ever meet, especially Harry (Harout). What a find!",

When I'm by myself, I get the Gyro Meraki and a side of the Avgolemono soup.  It's food that satisfies my soul.  Sometimes I get a Meraki Signature Bowl with gyro meat to go and it's enough to feed two.  I love bringing friends here so we can splurge and try all the spreads.  Don't forget to save room for dessert!  The rice pudding is heavenly.  I tell you, it's like going to Estiatorio Milos at the Cosmopolitan, but without the hassle and the price.  I bring out of town visitors here and everyone walks away satisfied.",

Feta fries were amazing.... flavors reminiscent of garlic bread. and dolmeh appeared to be fresh made as well. Everything was delicious and reasonably priced. Huge portions. Definitely give this place a try !!!",

Service is old school and fairly fast and friendly. Food takes about 5-7 minutes to hit the window. Been here a few times now and they are very consistent. 5/5",

The spanakopita was just as tasty perfectly made! Can't wait to come back",

I came in for dinner and the entire restaurant was alive and full of customers. The cashiers were very energetic and willing to answer any questions. I got the chicken plate and it came with fries or Greek rice. You also get salad and pita bread with white sauce. It was around 13 bucks I believe, which is the average price compared to similar restaurants. They give a very generous portion and I was full. They served it pretty fast considering how busy it was and the server came back to make sure everything was good. Since it is new the place is very clean. Overall I had an amazing first experience and I cannot wait to try it again.",

The Lamb Burger is beyond heavenly and one of the most flavorful & juiciest burgers I've tasted in a long time. It is pure bliss and melts in your mouth. The Gyros combo platter is served with the most these incredible crispy fries ( or rice ) and the freshest & top quality Greek Salad ever. The Baklava is to die for with it's oh so flaky honey syrup goodness. YUM!!  This place packs them in because they deliver above and beyond.   This place will put you in Serious Food Nirvana !!!",

We started off with a shared order of spanakopita that had a flaky pastry that enveloped a delicious spinach and feta interior - excellent. My wife chose the gyro Meraki while I went (too) hearty by ordering a gyro plate that included a copious amount of meat plus Greek rice, Greek salad, tzatzki, and slices of pita. Even though I did my best, I could not come close to finishing my meal. My sole complaint, admittedly a small one, is the Greek salad included lettuce and not enough feta.",

I have to say, Meraki is one of my absolute favorites.  I always get the bowl with a mix of rice and quinoa and add chicken. The bowls are huge first of all. The chicken is always tender and juicy and I love the mix of veggies, garbanzo beans and feta for the salad.  All you need to do is squeeze lemon and it's ready to go. Delicious, flavorful and healthy.  The staff is always super friendly and the service is quick. The restaurant is small but cute and clean.",

They didn't skimp on it either. I rarely eat fries, but the feta fries were taste. While even gyros aren't cheap, I feel like I got my $$$ worth and more.

However, that disappointment was soon forgotten when I started digging into my Beef/Lamb Gyro plate!    Everything was soo fresh and delicious, not too overly salted like other American places.

The price is ranging between $10 to $15, which is great value for the quality of food. I'd give the food a 4/5.  The ambience is that of a typical fast food restaurant. Nothing special there.",

    "text": "Meraki blew my mind. There are plenty of Greek options in Vegas, but I'm used to having to truck to Henderson for the best options. Not any more!   The signature bowl is amazing: huge portion of greek salad, your choice of grain, add on your protein. The grilled shrimp is perfectly seasoned and your carb choice includes quinoa as an option! I challenge you to finish this meal in a single sitting, it isn't possible. Is there such as thing as too much healthy deliciousness? This comes close. Their desserts are divine and you should always grab an order of spanakopita, even if you don't have room for it in your belly, because it reheats just fine.   But food alone doesn't make a restaurant great. The level of service at this fast-casual spot is ridiculous. They make suggestions as you order, bring you refills despite the self-serve drink station, check on you repeatedly, and make friendly conversation- all this in a clean, modern setting with potted flowers on each table. I already can't wait to go back!",

You order from the front counter and they bring the food out to you. Reminds me very much of the street food styled restaurants in Athens.   You can choose your table to sit at either inside the restaurant or outside the restaurant. Since it was cold on this day, my friends and I opted to sit inside.   I chose the Lamb Gyro plate because if there is anyone who knows how to cook Lamb right it is Greeks. Now let's talk about the portion size because it was INSANE. Talk about getting a bang for your buck! I believe the plate was around $10, but for the amount of food I got I was shocked that it only cost me $10. Having spent a lot of time in Greece, I was really shocked to come back to the U.S. and see how much Americans were charging for Greek food that cost 1 in Greece so I was very pleased to see that this particular place does not overcharge.   Onto the food and taste, the greek salad tasted very fresh (I do wish they put for dressing though). My favorite part was the lamb gyro and the rice--it tasted so yummy! I didn't get to eat the pita bread that came with it because I was already so incredibly full. I also ordered a falafel which was a little too dry for my liking.   Nonetheless, I would definitely visit again!",

I loved their pita bread, freshly baked and very fluffy. My bf had their signature bowls where you can customize what you choose. His choice consists of Green Rice, Ahi Tuna, Shrimp Kalamaki, Avocado, Dolmadakia. This bowl came out to be $25, kind of pricey but the food quality was present. The ingredients were crispy and fresh. For dessert, the Mamas rice pudding was sweet and tasty. It was wasn't runny, just creamy in a good way.  The guy there delivered excellent customer service.

The place is light, airy and clean. You order at the register and then the food is brought to your table. My wife ordered the Gyro Classico, I ordered the Gyro Meraki and we were both so pleased. There's just so much STUFF on the gyros and it's all so good! I will say that if you're not an onion fan, make sure and order no onions. I don't love onions, but know they can add flavor, so I didn't hold them off, hoping they would be diced. Unfortunately for me, they were rather large slices. But they were easy to pick off so all was well. We also ordered the hummus appetizer and feta fries as our sides. It was all soooooo good and we can't wait to go back!",

I got the fries and upgraded it to the feta fries.   The platter was huge!!  I literally could not finish it and had more than enough for lunch the next day. The salad was delicious and so was the lamb/ beef gyro. The fries were good as well but I think next time I'll just stick with the regular fries. The feta fries were good but it wasn't special enough to me for the price upgrade.   My friend got the gyro wrap and that was delicious as well. It was large, filled with meat and the Taziki sauce paired quite well with it.   We also go the eggplant dip as a starter and we loved that as well. It as creamy flavorful and smooth. Will definitely come back again!!",

Next time I might get the large salad - very tast salad that came with the platter. My only little gripe was that the chicken was a tad dry but still very flavorful. I ate it but didn't take home the left over skewer. It's the best nonstrip Greek I've had in Vegas. I usually like going to Milos, but I'd come here more often and save the money.   I'm adding this bit... went one day to find the octopus entree. It was a bit drenched in olive oil but still very tasty. They are a bit heavy on the olive oil, but I go at least once a week. One day I went for lunch and dinner  I've also had chicken skewers on other days, and it wasn't as dry. But their falafels are the best- perfectly crispy- more like a crunch on the outside. If I could and wasn't counting calories for deep fried food, I would have them more often.",

The hummus was very good and brought out quickly.  I wish that they had given us more pita bread wedges because they are very generous with the hummus.  One appetizer easily satisfied both of us.  I wish there were some flavored hummus options, but it's all good cause the plain hummus was still excellent!  As we were waiting, we saw the staff deliver 2 gyro plates to a table near by.  I was scared.  They were humongous!  When we received ours, they took up 2/3 of our entire table.  There was no way I was gonna finish this meal.  I had a good time trying though.   The gyro meat is delicious, tender, and juicy.  The tzatziki sauce was on point.  The Greek salad was light and fresh and tasty.  I got the side of feta fries, which were super good.  Personally, I'd have liked the melted feta to be made into a bit more of a sauce so that it would drip down a bit and hit all of the fries, but it tasted extremely good nonetheless.

Thankfully a considerate coworker called ahead and we had a table waiting for our party of five at this typically fast-casual restaurant. Man, I love it when a restaurant goes the extra mile!  Talk about clean eating! Meraki is loaded with greens, fresh veggies and some quality grilled meats. Because of this I ordered their \"Village Salad\" and with a skewer of grilled chicken. A thing a beauty this salad was. The colors, the ingredients, and the flavors, all top-notch. The chicken was juicy with just enough char to give it some texture, something I've never been able to achieve when cooking at home. Props to the kitchen!  To top it all off, Meraki is super affordable. If you live in the area, (which we don't) or if you have  a lunch meeting scheduled in the area, (which we did) this is your new lunch location. A full belly with a fraction of the guilt? Sign me up! Again, and again, and again, and again...",

We ordered the Chicken Gyro, a child's lamb gyro platter, and their Meraki Lamb Burger (medium of course)  The burger was perfectly cooked and is now one of my favorites in town! It was so juicy and was perfectly flavored with the tzatziki sauce and onions!   Amazing burger that's it! Try it!!!!",

The fries were crisp to the bite and soft and starchy inside.   The salad on the side was mediocre and didn't add much to the dish. The flavors of the cheese and dressing were very harsh on the palate and had no balance.",

    "text": "So fresh and so clean, clean!  Man, this was so unsuspecting as we rolled up to the strip mall. But you learn to trust Yelpers. And when in Rome, you go where the Yelpers tell you. When in Greece, the same applies. When in Las Vegas, you fire up the app and go where they say.   It was a business lunch, and while the place was a-hopping and kinda loud, it was so in that friendly, family bustle kind of way. The kind that you want to fill your house with on the weekends, with family coming and going, and good food, and incredible smells. It's all family there, and it's full of those things, including smiles from the service.  For me it was about those Greek fries. Feta fries. Yessir, you pair those with a lamb burger served medium rare and you'll have a real shot and lunchtime glory. It was juicy, soft, and had the subtle taste of tender lamb and not a hint of oldness or game-ness. The fries are the showstoppers with generous amounts of feta and a nice breading to give them body. You will be pressured to share and you will be tempted not to. Follow your heart.  It's a modern space. We had to park a ways away as it was the height of the lunch hour and it was packed, but when we left the parking had cleared out a bit. It's a fast casual concept so you order at the counter, and it's cheaper than full service, but don't expect fast food pricing.",

This time, in a more spacious, centralized location on the West side! OPA!!!  I love me some Greek food, and having tried a few spots in town, Meraki never disappoints. We stopped in for lunch on a couple of occasions and we always share our favorites-Lamb Burger, Chicken Gyro Meraki with Feta Fries, and a bowl of Avgolemono. Cheese lovers, start of with a plate of the Saganaki, always a hit every time!  Be sure to save room and DO NOT pass up desserts. While Meraki's Semolina Cake drizzled with a lemon syrup and the Baklava are pretty  good, my favorite sweets are the Rice Pudding and the Baklava Ice Cream which are great for sharing(or not! ;)  Looking forward to returning to trying the signature specials like their grilled octopus,  lamb chops, and lamb shank as well. So glad they are back in business...ALOHA!!!  Shaka Meter:  \\uuu/  \\uuu/  \\uuu/  \\uuu/  \\uuu/  5",

It's a local spot yet I take my friends when they're visiting. I can't even tell you how many people I know who say Meraki is their favorite. I have friends who drive across town to eat here. Luckily I live pretty close. There's not a lot of parking nor many places to sit. It's a pretty small location. But trust me, you gotta eat here. It's very cute inside and well decorated. The service is always friendly and they make great suggestions.  Even on the busiest of days when they apologize that the food may take long to get to you, it doesn't take that long. You can see the cooks hustling in the kitchen and they always have a lot of staff.  The food is just beyond amazing. The portions are HUGE!! It's so fresh and so flavorful and so delicious. From gyros to plates to salads I've never been disappointed. Their tzatziki sauce...I could bathe in it, wow. It's so good and fresh. Their meat is delicious. It is sooo hard to pick between the rice and the feta fries as a side because both are to die for.  As you can tell I really love this place and you should all give it a try. The only downfall is it's closed on Mondays but I'll look past that!",

But the good thing is they are moving fast, and I didn't have to wait forever to put my order in. The lady, who I think is the owner, was super smart and kind. I had the gyro meraki combo, lamb and beef, with feta fries. It was good, except the meat was a bit too dry in my opinion.  And the feta fries... I mean, I love feta cheese, I love fries, why the heck didn't I get this idea myself of combining both together?? Haha The restaurant is super clean, and even if it was packed I could find a spot to seat. One of the lovely ladies from the staff came right away to clean the table (and apologized she didn't do it prior to my seating) and my food came out within 5 minutes. Great spot for a quick lunch. I will go back and try some other items from their menu.",

I tried a bowl with quinoa and falafel. It just needed a bit more dressing, IMO. The hummus with veggies was a big hit. Our kids loved the lemon soup (Sai for was the best they have tried) and also tried the chicken skewers. My husband had the chicken skewers also and said they were great. The desserts!! Yum. Overall, a delicious dinner and nice experience. We will be back.",

This is the only Greek place I have eaten in ,in Vegas in 40 years, that matches the food in Astoria!. Everything is just absolutely delicious. The Chicken Kabob is marinated and seasoned to perfection and the chicken is moist and tender on the inside with a crisp wonderful char on the outside.  The Greek salad is terrific with quality imported Fet and a perfectly seasoned dressing. The Spanocapita is perfect as are the cold stuffed grape leaves (Dolmathes) You cannot go wrong eating here!",

I bought a house right down the street from this place and it has taken me over a year to come try it.  First off I think they hire male models to work here!  but those male models are incredibly nice. I ordered the gyro meraki with the Greek salad. It was a great portion of lamb and very flavorful. I thought after that I would just head out, but after reading some yelp reviews I decided I needed some Baklava. I can not put words to how amazing it was! I literally almost went home put a wig and a different outfit on to come back and order more. I can not wait to try the other desserts. I will definitely be coming back here, and how lucky am I that I can just walk here!",

A very distinguishing sign on the outside let's you know what they're all about and what to expect when walking inside.  I like the casual atmosphere and simple design work of the restaurant.  The real draw for Meraki is the food.  As a first timer I wanted to try everything on the menu but decided to try the saganaki, avgolemeno soup, signature bowl with rice and a skewer of chicken.  All of the food was amazingly fresh and perfectly portioned.  My friend ordered the lamb sandwich and a classic Greek salad, both of which he happily finished.  I also tried the dolmades appetizer which the server brought to our table mistakingly, will definitely order them next time.  Last but not least I tried the baklava ice cream which is quite a portion for one person but great to share since it is quite rich in texture but tastes amazing!",

I had the Feta fries, small Greek salad, and soup with pitas on the side. Everything was hot and delicious! I will become a regular there and put it on my list of lunch places too.",

Was disappointed that there was all this baklava sitting on the counter but it was all already \"sold\"..... so the gal gave me a complimentary slice of wet cake. Not good... The gyros were delicious and the ingredients were fresh. Overall good food and good service. I will be back again soon and try some of their other menu items. Hopefully all their baklava won't be sold again! Lol",

    "text": "Found this place on yelp while searching for a gyro. I drove a little out of the way to go here because it had great reviews.  The restaurant was pretty busy, but we didn't have to wait in line to order.  Customer service was good.  Wait time was a bit long,  but not too bad for how busy it was.  I would give the quality of food 5 stars,  but it was lacking in flavor a bit.  I ordered the gyro meraki and the feta fries.  I had to use a lot of salt.  Overall,  a good experience,  but I probably wouldn't  drive out of my way to go here again.",
