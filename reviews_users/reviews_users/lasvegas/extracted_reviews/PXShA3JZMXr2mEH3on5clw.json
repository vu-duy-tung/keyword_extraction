With all the positive reviews I knew this place would be good but I was in no way prepared for what I experienced. I'm from California and a bit of a foodie so I have had some great breakfast dishes. This place is no exception! I was blown away by not only the quality of the food but the exceptional service. Our waiter started right off by recommending some favorites. I ended up going with a carnitas breakfast burrito which I have never had. My girl went with biscuits and gravy. Both of us were totally blown away. Not only was my burrito perfect and amazing. But the potatoes(which I'm usually not super crazy about) were insane! The port in my burrito was super juicy and full of flavor. My girl was raving about her mouth watering gray which was the perfect density and full of flavor. I also would like to mention at how pleasant all the employees seemed to be working here. It says a lot about the management and the owners. There needs to be more restaurants like egg works! This will be our stop every time we go to Vegas.",

He took the time to check in with us  to see how the meal tasted and to make sure we had everything we needed. The restaurant uses a yellow egg/black egg system that alerts all servers that some sort of attention is needed at the table. This is a very helpful way making the restaurant more efficient and an overall better experience. I will absolutely return and tell everyone I know how eggs-cellent this place is!",

Menu in the form of a newspaper.. as reading the paper is synonymous with reading it while eating breakfast. Haha, clever :)  Many people come to this place for their moist banana nut muffins, but, I came for their seasoned potatoes! Something about the diablo seasoning = yum.   People from Hawaii: this is your breakfast place away from home. I mean, Vegas is Hawaii's \"9th island\", but it's still nice to see the local guys carrying on the spirit in the mainland. Our excellent server, PK, was from the island of Kauai. Very personable, attentative, and funny. Definitely a guy to \"talk story\" with. He is such a great person/server that it wasn't a surprise to overhear a host tell him that another patron requested to be served by him. And the nice cashier was from my hometown of Ewa Beach, Oahu.   The service and food is consistently great each time my family and I come here, and I recommend my friends to try out this place for breakfast, whenever I find out they're traveling to Vegas. Make sure to ask for PK as your server!",

    "text": "I really truly did want to try Egg Works after having it bookmarked for so long. The parking lot had plenty of parking. We arrived mid-morning so we avoided the morning rush and were seated promptly. Looking around everyone was taking food to go so we opted to share an omelette and get an extra muffin with the Yelp check-in. I asked the waiter if this would be okay and she said yes. We ordered the works omelette as it seemed to have a little bit of everything.  Our muffins arrived and neither of us was impressed with it. Sure it was warm and the butter melted on it but the flavor I was expecting just wasn't there. Our omelette arrived and the portion was really huge. I was disappointed as everything was so chopped and mushed that you couldn't distinguish any of the contents and this we both found disgusting. The even more disgusting part is yet to come. When our bill arrived, we noticed we were charged for the muffin in addition our omelette. No big deal, or so I thought. Thought they'd take care of it when we checked out at the cash register but boy, I didn't think it would take a whole lot of time.  The cashier started to pull up our check and I let her know about the Yelp check-in. She proceeded to insist that because we ordered an \"extra\" muffin that's why we were charged. After explaining it she proceeded to ask the hostess if the Yelp check-in was still valid. If anyone should know these things, you'd think it would be the cashier who rings people up all day. Now there was a line of at least 3 people waiting to pay their checks and I could certainly feel their eye rolls over waiting during this whole ordeal. It wasn't the $2 muffin, but the sole principal that if you have something on your Yelp page, you should honor it. Lastly, they had to have the manager come over and remove it from our bill.   I'm not quite sure I understand the hype of this place. Come if you have an abundance of time to kill, but don't expect the food to be anything special. There are plenty of other places in the area that we've been to that rank way higher than Egg Works. Sorry, but unfortunately we won't be coming back here.  2016 Review #57",

I always get the country fried steak and it is always cooked to perfection and they always put enough gravy on the fried steaks so I have never asked for more. There has always been a wait ever since I first visited but it is totally worth it. I really do recommend coming here if you are from out of town because it is worth it.

When we first got there, there was a little bit of a wait--maybe 10 minutes or less (which was surprising, because that place was PACKED). Once we were seated though, it took less than 10 minutes to get a server to come by and ask us what we wanted to drink. And not only that, but she was super friendly and not frantic at all.  I ordered the prime rib benedict (soooooo good) and my boyfriend ordered the chicken fried steak (he loved it). When our drinks and food showed up, they showed up surprisingly quick, and with a smile. By checking in on Yelp, we both got banana nut muffins--and they were DELICIOUS. Overall, I'm really happy with this find.  Hey Egg Works, care to open up a few in Salt Lake City? :)",

Breakfast is my favorite meal of the day and when it comes this meal, I tend to keep it simple...just an omelet and some carbs. On my most recent visit, I had brunch with a couple of friends.  And for my meal, I had a 6 egg white omelet with spinach and mushrooms.  It was high carb day, so I had a bowl of oatmeal added to my meal.  The food is consistent and for egg whites, very tasty.  Oh yeah, I also had some turkey bacon that actually taste like real bacon.    As for their service, I'd give them 4 stars.  Keep in mind that this is one crazy busy Egg Works on the weekends.  This visit was mid-day and mid-week.  In other words, we were seated right away, got our food right away, and was out of here fairly quick.  Overall, you can't go wrong for breakfast at Egg Works, especially if it's consistency that you're striving for.    YELP PERSONAL CHALLENGE 2013 - (487/500)",

Our waitress was amazing she was so sweet and attentive. Our food came out after 20 minutes and was delicious with big portions. Their banana nut bread and bacon pancakes are a must try.   Side note, I love the fact that there is breathing room in this restaurant. They could definitely squeeze in a few more tables if they wants to but I enjoyed even sitting near a walkway that we weren't getting bumped into or felt confined.

What makes it worse is that at least 3 waiters walked right past us, made eye contact and kept it moving. We didn't even get asked what we wanted to drink...   We eat at restaurants probably about 8-10 times a week and I can honestly say I've never seen something like this happen before. Its unacceptable and really disappointing since The location was so convenient.  Anyways, we made the drives to the Egg Works on Eastern and Sunridge heights and the service so far is amazing we have drink already and its been less than 5 minutes. The sunset location should be ashamed.",

We've had her before and it's always a hit. She has a great personality, and always goes above and beyond.   We had a little bump in the road today. They brought out regular pancakes instead of the banana. Donna made sure to take the pancakes off our bill and also gave us extra muffins to take home. Btw the muffins are sooooooooooo good!

    "text": "Got off the plane after an overnight flight and headed straight here looking for some good breakfast to start our Vegas vacation.  We'd been to Egg & I up on Sahara before, so we pretty much knew what to expect as far as the menu went, but you never know how things will actually turn out at a different location.  We were not disappointed.  There was a short waiting list for tables, but we opted to get seats at the counter immediately.  Service was friendly and quick, and we soon had our orders in.  While we waited for our food, we were able to watch the goings-on behind the counter and in the kitchen - always fun.  Man, they turn around pans of those signature banana muffins like gangbusters.  I had the Works Skillet, which was pretty much everything you need.  Potatoes on the bottom, ham, bacon, sausage, mushrooms, onions, and peppers, covered in cheddar and jack cheese, and topped with two eggs (sunny side up for me).  The thing was huge, and I only finished about two-thirds of it.  I opted for toast and ate one slice.  If I had gotten the banana muffin, I probably wouldn't have been able to make it through half the skillet.  My wife got the mashed potato omelette, which she said she enjoyed.  It looked good, but with all that delicious food on my own plate, I didn't dare venture over to taste something else.  Just like at Egg & I, the coffee is really good.  I asked what coffee they use, but of course I forgot.  At any rate, it was something I hadn't heard of, so I'll bet it's something for food service that you can only buy in 20-ton packages...  Overall, Egg Works is a great place to go for good food, good coffee, and good service.  Going to make it one of my regular stops whenever I'm in Vegas.",

I came here with some friends (this place is definitely fam-friendly) for a quick brunch, expecting the a \"typical\" american breakfast. It was a pleasant surprise to get one of the best egg benedicts I've ever had! For the more daring, the turkey benedict with chipotle hollandaise sauce was also excellent.  Service was friendly and efficient; had out food out within 15min, and dirty plates out in 10. The relaxed atmosphere and cozy vibe invited us to stay longer and enjoy our coffee (it's nice when a carafe is left on the table for all to share). All in all, this is the kind of place that reminds you why breakfast is the most important meal of the day, and possibly can be the most enjoyable.",

The manager came to our table apologized and said they discounted a percentage due to the long wait, I thought maybe once the food came out it was worth the wait.... nope! The food was nasty and cold I got the chicken and chorizo hash that looked like dog food and taste nasty my child's order was all wrong which the manager said she was going to remove from the tab when I told the waiter it was still on the receipt for 6.20 and she only removed 4.16 or so at that point I just wanted to get out. Never will be back I regret not waiting at baby stacks for the 45 min wait since I ended up waiting more here just for food that wasn't even worth it!",

The issue i have is our waiter was nice but she talked too much! We couldn't even really enjoy our food cause she kept coming to the table every 2 minutes! Yikes! They other thing was that they brought my cousin her skillet but never brought her pancakes. We asked what happened to the pancakes?? The waiter was like \"oh let me go check\" that was 10 or 15 minutes later but between that time she still was coming by checking on us.  I will go back but i just hope my waiter don't talk our ear off again. Sheesh!",

Anyhow, the staff was very friendly and we were seated right away. The waitress was extremely friendly and helped explain what she was out of for the healthier options as we asked for a side of full protein rather than receive bread and potatoes. So if you're on a special diet or doing Keto like myself you can definitely find something to chow down on. I went with the Mexican omelette because I love chorizo, but the chorizo wasn't what I expected. It was tasty but more of a Americanized chorizo. It had hints of taco seasonings and reminded me of Texas chili. It was still tasty. For my full side of protein I went with turkey sausage. Turkey is bland itself but this sausage attempts to add flavor with a number of seasonings within. Not the best but not to bad. Although I enjoyed the meal I believe this place to be pretty mediocre.",

Cajun seasoning  on point. Huge portions. Great service. Excellent food. Very comfortable, relaxed diner. Coffee was good, too, for being cheap diner coffee. Highly recommend this place for a top notch breakfast before getting wrecked and losing your money on the slots.",

Ok so they charge a dollar or maybe a dollar fifty. Oh hell no. $3.35 for 6 oz of OJ for a kid. But they have no problem giving the all the damn soda they want. Waitress did not tell us it would be more the half of the price of her meal for a refill on juice. Then when I said something about it she said I know it is ridiculous that they charge that much. I said then why the hell didnt you freaking tell me it was that much.   Egg works can kiss my ass. Won't there again.  Thank you Ashly but I am not looking at getting anyone fired or in trouble for the businesses pricing. That is not her fault but it is management and the owners fault. Thank you for your reply.",

Started scanning pictures of various breakfast options on Yelp and was immediately distressed to see what were obviously frozen cubed potatoes heaped in ridiculously huge portions with many dishes. Ordered an omelet, which was absolutely top shelf. But it was served with a massive pile of the crappy potatoes, and they were as bad as they looked in pictures - very dry, clearly frozen, devoid of flavor (other than the \"seasoning\" they were coated in) and just.. lousy. And, my wheat toast had to be at least a week old - incredibly dry and obviously very stale. So odd for the side items to be so bad when the omelet was so right. Give me some fresh hash browns and reasonably recent toast, and this would have been a really great breakfast.",

I had to give it a try. I am so thankful that I did.   I ordered the Mexican Omelette, which is made with four eggs, btw, and it's pretty large. I almost finished and I usually never eat large breakfast portions, but it was delicious, I couldn't put the fork down.   I am avoiding pork, so I asked them to hold the chorizo, and it was so perfect. The potatoes on the side were also super yummy! Sorry that I didn't snap a pic before it was eaten.   Oh, and, not that it truly matters much, but the service was also above average, and being a former server myself, I genuinely appreciated the hospitality.   Thank you Egg Works, I will come back next time!",

I only give out 5 stars to places that really go above and behind and are a bit more creative. So 4 stars to them is not a slap. Their food is tasty and I probably eat there for breakfast once a month.  Their prices are reasonable too, especially for people that need a little hair of the dog.  The last time we visited I notice that they also have some Hawaiian specialties; I have to say that I really liked the Loco Moco!  I can't wait to try the new location! Keep up the great grub!",

I brought my dogs here several times. The servers are always very friendly but not as attentive as they could be and lack attention to detail. I've experienced this with a few different servers. Such as never being checked back on after I get my food. Never. And me never having a napkin throughout my entire dining experience because  no one anticipated that I would need one initially, or checked on me until I was finished eating . Also leaving me there way too long to accept my money. I felt uncomfortable leaving money sitting on the patio, I eventually did. The food is decent but often cold and I don't have an opportunity to do anything about it because no one ever checks on me so I end up eating cold food. I have experienced this indoors as well. Their famous potatoes aren't that great and they are usually cold.",

I could probably give this place a 2 or 3 star rating but on my visit I chose to sit on their patio since it was a nice morning.  Well, this establishment chooses to allow their patrons to sit at their tables and chain smoke...before, during and after their meals! WTF is up with that? Isn't it now law that smoking is banned within X amount of feet of the door AND where food is being served/consumed?  I'm not sure who is more to blame; the owner for allowing this or the idiotic patrons that can't put down their nicotine sticks for one god damned meal!  I mean really, you need to be holding a smoke in one hand and a fork in another!?!?!? I won't be back!",

Fresh ingredients and homemade goods are the key. Frozen spinach, brought-in pastries, eggs from a jug -- these are where nightmares are formed. Thankfully, I didn't encounter any of the above at Egg Works.  The omelets here are absolutely delicious. I got one with mashed potatoes inside -- what's not to love? I also tried the veggie omelet -- very good, too. Oh and I'm a fan of the home fries. Fresh food, enormous portions, and friendly service.  The only downsides were the speed of service -- the kitchen was swamped that day, so things were SLOWWW. Also, the orange juice is not fresh squeezed (but I appreciate that the waitress was honest when I asked if it is fresh squeezed).",

Not once did we ever have to \"flip the egg,\" he was a happy egg the whole time.",

I've been here a couple times and I remember the first time I came, my plate came with fresh fruit on the side. The last couple times I've come here, there's no fresh fruit! What the fudge? Whatever the plate full of food in front of me made me quickly forget.  Boy gets the corned beef hash and in particular likes the poached eggs that he can order with it.   My safe go-to whenever I'm craving a hearty breakfast. :)",

Providing flavored cream for coffee is an extra plus. (Hazelnut hands down). My other half ordered the Waffle Works which he found was mediocre.  Our waitress was the lovely Candice. I absolutely enjoyed her enthusiasm. My boyfriend thought she was too peppy for his tastes but after our meal, he said she became bearable. He's grumpy when he's hungry.  The cashier seemed agitated too. I guess anyone in the lobby area isn't as chipper as Candice. Way to set the standards Candice!",

HOMEMADE BANANA NUT MUFFIN!! SOOO DELICIOUS!!! =99999 yes, it comes free! =)  service was impeccable.. waitress was so nice to us and made sure we were satisfied. she's the one with the chinese lettering tattoos on her right and left wrists. if you see her, you know she'll treat you well!!  total was $24. that's much cheaper than eating not so great buffet food for one person! i've never had such a great breakfast/brunch experience in vegas until now...thanks egg works!!

Their enchilada sauce is fantastic. There is a huge selection so I have plenty of veggie options. The carnivores that I've brought here love it too.  Service is friendly, and they get the food out so dang fast. Just what you want in a breakfast joint.

    "text": "Service was oddly slow today, but the food is always, I say again, always amazing. They have a really cool concept going here. Each table features a little egg that yellow on one side with a sad face or black on the other with a happy face. A sad egg and everyone stops what they are doing and jumps at the opportunity to fix the situation. Sometimes i flip the egg just see what will happen :)   I prefer the omelets and sausage links. The coffee isn't the best so I say go with some juice or something else like that instead. I had the biscuits and gravy with some scrambled eggs and sausage patties. The patties were kinda dry which was a total shock. The potatoes that they serve are simply the best breakfast potatoes money can buy. Honestly thats what bumped them up to 4 stars from 3.   The location is pretty busy but they get tables cleared out fairly quick. I have never had to wait too long. If your in the mood for some good breakfast anytime of the day this is definitely your spot.",

    "text": "I came here this morning with my family around 6:30am before catching my 9am flight at McCarran. I think this is the nearest place to the airport with decent breakfast that opens that opens before 7am.   We ordered: Country fried steak - My brother said the potatoes were a little too seasoned for his taste, but he still wiped his plate clean  Fresh Veggie Skillet - Got my eggs over easy so I could mix everything up. I got a banana nut muffin that came with the meal, but I just took a couple pinches of it because it didn't taste like banana nut at all. It tasted very plain and the appearance was a little strange. The bottom part was all small and the top was kind of flat with crispy edges. Imagine a small flap jack on top of a shot glass; that's what it looked like. I wish there were a little more veggies in the skillet besides the potatoes, which took up 75% of the skillet. The potatoes looked very seasoned, but they didn't taste overly salty or anything. All in all, it was okay, but I probably wouldn't order it again. I'll stick to an omelet next time because I know it'll have a lot more veggies.   Loco Moco (American version) - This was the American version, I believe. The gravy looked like the same gravy that was on the country fried steak my brother got and it made the dish taste just like it too. The only difference was that the Country Fried steak was served with potatoes and this was served over rice.   The Classic - Pretty basic meal, but my mom said it was good. I guess she assumed all of our meals were going to be pretty large so she could pick at them, which is the reason why she got that.   Of course, my mom was right. All of our meals were pretty big, but not overwhelming. My brother cleaned his plate, my mom left one over easy egg, my boyfriend had a small cup of rice left, and I had some potatoes left. The bill came out to $47, but I had a bogo entree coupon from the 2011 Entertainment book with an $8 value. I don't think there was a single entree below $8, but they took the $8 out of our bill, so it turned out to be $39. That's a pretty good deal if you ask me!  I'll come back here again if I want breakfast before a flight. They have a big sign out front that says they're open 6am-3pm, so I guess they just do breakfast and lunch. The airport is just a few turns away from this place so you don't have to worry about being late if you get here a couple hours before your flight.",

There is almost always a wait on the weekends but you can try your luck sitting at the bar in the back. Servers are always prompt and aware even with 4-6 table sections. Only negative, which is not the restaurant's fault, is you can almost always count on a little rug-rat sprinting around the place with no parental units to be found. There's nothing worse than trying to enjoy your bloody mary on Sunday while a 5 year old knocks into your table. Green chili pork carnitas with an egg over easy and eggs benedict are both a must.

The restaurant seems to have a large number of tables for two, as nearly all parties of two were seated almost immediately.  I guess the timing didn't work out sooner for two tables to be pushed together.  Waiting until nearly noon before I had my first cup of coffee did not make me happy!  However, once we sat down the service was great.  We got our food quickly.  I loved the menu.  There were so many options that were right up my alley, with skillets, Mexican breakfast dishes, etc.  I ordered a skillet with chili.  It was fairly simple.  Potatoes, chili, cheese and two poached eggs.  It was really tasty.  My hubby ordered pork chops and eggs  and he enjoyed those.  He liked the way the pork chops were seasoned.  Our daughter ordered butterscotch pancakes and she wasn't thrilled with them, but she liked ours.  After we were seated, the crowd seemed to thin out.  I guess it was just bad timing on our part.  I hope we can come back again on our next trip!",

The food was bland the quality defiantly does not compare to the other location. One of the host  or server was only catering to his parents . Found it very unprofessional for him to pull up a chair at a two seater table sit down just to chit chat then have his mother obnoxiously yell over the table where my family and I were seated for her sons attention every single time when she needed something instead of waiting for assistance like any other paying customer. It's unfortunate that even if it were to be more convenient for me to come to this location with my family I'd never return here.     Kudos Sahara  location - see ya soon!!

The muffin was warm and the butter melted immediately and was a nice salty bite.   I ordered the corned beef hash with a side of their seasoned potatoes and sourdough toast. The corned beef hash was made fresh, not from a can according to our server. The hash was on point. The potatoes were crispy and had a seasoning that was similar to BBQ.",

    "text": "Banana. Nut. Muffin. Freshly baked, so soft and moist it slices like cake! You must be thinking, why in the world did I eat my muffin with a fork and knife? Well, I saw my friend's grandma do the same and wanted to keep up my etiquette ;-) check in on Yelp to get one free! And most breakfast plates come with the option if you don't want ordinary toast. Not hating on toast-- I love me some marble rye so warm it melts butter! And a dab of raspberry jam if it's wheat.  Overwhelming newspaper menu similar to Black Bear Diner. Cute. So many options! I noticed a trend with some fillings, just a different type of food. I got \"the Works\" skillet breakfast which is ham, bacon, sausage, mushroom, onion, diced tomato, green bell peppers, cheddar, 2 eggs all over Habla Diablo seasoned potatoes. You can order the Works for just about anything, including omelets, scramble, etc. Cheesy goodness! My over medium eggs looked great and burst at the yoke with a single poke, oozing all over the squared potatoes down below. I'll admit my dish was a tad bit saltier than my preference, but it's probably from the seasoning.  The friend (the birthday girl!) and her family ordered waffles, corn beef hash, veggie crepes that look like omelets upon first glance, omelets and banana nut muffins all around, with an order of toast. Large portions, lower prices! Apparently there's a Groupon deal right now and that's how my friend's dad discovered this place.  There's something for everyone! Pancakes, waffles, French toast, omelets, scrambles, crepes, hashes, etc. I also saw mimosas on the menu for the early drinkers.   Sunday morning was busy but we snagged a 6 seater. Friendly, comfortable, homey environment! Staff is so nice! Troy took drink orders, poured coffee for everyone, and even asked if I'd like whipped cream on my hot chocolate or not. Maybe lots of folks would rather skip the calories? We're in Vegas! Back to the gym next week ... Drea was a delight! She took our orders and made us feel so welcome. We asked for recommendations and she said everything is good! I shall return. And will order half a dozen banana nut muffins to go =)",

My omelette was good, not spongey or overcooked, but my roasted potatoes were only ok. The roasted potatoes were a little dry to me so it was only ok even though the flavor was there.

The place tends to be kind of large with a lot of seating and definitely busy. But luckily, it hasn't ever been short staffed. They've been very sweet in general!   Everything in the menu sounds like you can't go wrong. I kind of want to try everything. The skillet tastes amazing and I think omelettes are my huge favorite. I stuck with something I'm familiar with, the Benedict's but I liked the other stuff more.. mainly because I wasn't feeling Canadian bacon. Aside from that, they offer a variety of different Benedict's and I liked the spinach one more. Their potatoes are also heavily seasoned and taste delicious. I think it's Cajun seasoned. Some fries tend to have an aftertaste more than a flavor, but their potatoes are savory! I usually end up throwing away most of my fries because they never taste good after a few or some are just dissatisfying but with this, I literally wanted to ask for more. (I didn't.)   With some meals the banana walnut muffin is complimentary. This muffin alone tastes heavenly and is such a good texture. I'd get order one and an extra one because you will feel like ones not enough!",

She's always super friendly and attentive and remembers our usual order. Food review as follows:  Mashed Potato Omelette: 5/5 My absolute favorite omelette, this is a perfect order for all the potato lovers out there. It's a huge omelette stuffed with garlic mashed potatoes and bacon topped with sour cream and melted cheese, and served with a huge side of the potatoes. I usually get a half order and it's the perfect size (plus it's a little bit cheaper!). I also order it vegetarian style aka without the bacon and I find it delicious!  Banana Nut Muffin: 5/5 A lot of the meals come with either toast or the banana nut muffin, but do yourself a favor, and get the muffin. It's served warm and it's heavenly with butter.  Stuffed Toast: 3/5 I wasn't a fan of the stuffed toast. It had too much cinnamon for my preference and not enough savory to counteract the sweet. To be fair, I ordered it without meat and it would probably be way better with sausage.   Habla Diablo Potatoes: 5/5 These are one of my favorite breakfast potatoes. They're super well seasoned, crispy, and delicious.   Overall: 5/5 I love Egg Works! It's a super cute restaurant with an amazing staff and great food ^_^",

I went back to her shortly to ask the price of the coffee mug special  (bogo). She was still too busy to make eye contact she began to say what she thought the price was and then said to me \"isn't there a flyer that's posted out there?\" I said yes but no price. Again she went back to \"I think but continued with umm $7.00...it's either it is or it isn't.  Aside from that one negative everyone else is really personable helpful and friendly.  Lots of good food choices and quality.  I used to come here for our Union meetings too bad they won't accommodate our party at the sectioned area any longer.",

My fiance ordered the prime rib benedict, which he didn't like very much...I had the breakfast burrito, which was REALLY good. The drinks were okay - we had fresh squeezed juice (orange) and a blood mary. I've had better, so I wasn't very impressed...  I would say it's a solid place for breakfast and not terribly expensive. They had SO many choices, it was overwhelming deciding what to order!!!",

My husband loves their benedicts (mainly because of the hollandaise) and I usually go for a skillet. I did learn a valuable lesson this trip though, when presented with the massive portion that I knew I would never be able to get through. You can order a half portion of most of the menu items! Who knew? Not me. I will definately be taking advantage of this next time I visit becase I didn't make a dent in my food this trip. The only complaint I have this visit is that I didn't receive my toast or my complimentary muffin for Yelp check-in. Not that I needed the extra food, it's just the fact that it was forgotten.",

The flavor was great in both the works veggie Benedict and the veggie crepe. The service was very friendly and accommodating. They could probably cut back a little on the hash browns but because the item was such a good size, I wasn't upset at all, its just that I like to finish my entire plate but if I did, it would've been a lot...too much, which isn't exactly bad but being a former chef, I pay attention to food waste. From a customer point of view it's great, though. Plus, they are deep fried hash brown diced cubes. It cancels out my recent quest for healthy breakfast of eating more veggies. All in all it was great flavor and service so not bad.   I would recommend to any fellow breakfast connoisseurs.",

I've been to Egg & I and knew this place was pretty much the same, so of course I ordered the Stuffed French Toast Sandwich with sausage ($10.25) and chocolate chip pancakes ($9.25 for 3 pancakes) for my dad and I to share.  I've had their chocolate chip pumpkin pancakes before and it  was to die for, but the plain chocolate chips one was less impressive.  They need to add whipped cream to it or something because just syrup doesn't really work with this kind of dish.  The stuffed french toast was amazing, especially with a drizzle of syrup, and their seasoned potatoes were good too.  We also had the banana nut muffins - FREE with a Yelp check-in!  Michelle was an awesome and cool server, refilling our waters without having to ask and just being really there for us when we needed her.  The service was perfect for a Sunday morning right before heading back home.  It's very filling here, so try and order different plates and share because the menu is HUGE!

It's a very huge portion and it tastes super good by itself but throw on some of that chipotle hot sauce and it's a winner. The side of potatoes it comes with are phenomenal super crispy and seasoned to perfection.   Checked in and got the free muffin, server actually gave us an extra one at no charge because of the wait.

That was the bee's knees. Ol standby is Huevos Rancheros, which is also very good. Or just get a mound of potatoes. Yeah, they are pretty freaking good. Pork Carnitas Burrito has some decent heat, meat is a little too drippy though, but not a bad decision.  A few things to remember:  This is a breakfast place. A casual breakfast place. Stick to casual breakfast foods. The Mexican dishes are generally pretty good. The omelettes are the heavy hitters. Once you wander off the reservation, that's when you get disappointed.   One example: The Crazy Chicken omelette is gross. The description states a julienned chicken breast but it was more like salty cubes of chicken. The other ingredients (mushrooms / guacamole / muenster cheese / sour cream) do NOT mesh together. You get a gloopy mess at the end. Anything that offers upscale meat (prime rib) you should be weary of. Stick to traditional breakfast foods.  And if the food you ordered isn't great, they still come with potatoes most of the time. It's always the positive.",

Can't wait to go back and try an omelette and one of the skillet breakfasts. The food tasted great and I loved the restaurant. Unfortunately I don't live in Vegas, but I visit often and will definitely be back!!",

Huge pieces of perfectly ripe fruit! I had to take my extras with me. The Eggs Benedict had thick pieces of ham, oozing eggs and a crisp muffin.  We ordered a custom omelette. They are happy to give you exactly what you want. The cheese was generous and soooo melty ( is that a word?). The edges were crisp and buttery. As decadent as it was, it wasn't heavy or greasy.   Definitely a stop you will be happy with!",

My daughter ordered the biscuits and gravy, and I actually ate some of it and the gravy was out of this world, definitely the best I have had at a restaurant!  My niece is a vegetarian and ordered the veggie skillet, which she also loved, and it came with their famous banana muffin, we all split it and it was delicious!

We arrived at 10am on a Saturday morning to the busy restaurant but were seated right away and helped by a kind hostess, who gave us great recommendations. Being from the American South, biscuits and gravy hold high standards in my heart and I was excited to try theirs. Creamy and peppery, the gravy had the perfect amount of sausage covering a flaky biscuit. My husband had the breakfast burrito and stated it was good, however the sauce really catapulted the burrito to new heights. The best part? The potatoes. You have to try these!

Normally places like to give you a shaving of a slice, which saddens me because avocados are amazing. The food was good quality and my server, Kathleen, was very nice. I am only rating this 4 stars instead of 5 because it was just too much food and it hurts my heart as a foodie to let it go to waste and there was a bit too much cheese.

But the last time we went....our food was not all that great. Now of course, as soon as we walked in we got seated. Didn't like where we were placed because we like a little privacy...so we asked the lady hostess if we can be moved and she said yes and placed us near the back by the kitchen (which was not too bad).  We ordered, and waited about 20 minutes until our food came out. Our banana nut muffin were the first things that came out. Probably the best thing we had from them. Now the worst thing about being at a restaurant is seeing & hearing all the arguments in the kitchen. This is exactly what happened. We heard complaints from the kitchen workers, and the waiters and just everything we didn't want to....nor need to really hear.   Soon as our food came out, it was super salty and soggy!!! My boyfriend ordered the skillet and I had the homemade corned beef hash. Everyone loves a little salt here and there...but having too much, I thought I was going to have a heart attack! Then we got our checks and left.  Overall it was a bad experience and I don't think we'll return to this place again. Such a shame because we loved this place and it's close to our place. I hope we find another breakfast joint soon.",

But Friday and Saturday there was no wait to be seated. Our server Diane was also training a newby but was super attentive- both to our group as well as making sure to train the kid right, which I appreciated! Between our group we had 9 different meals, and none of us had any complaints! The food was all fresh, eggs poached right, hollandaise sauce was creamy and smooth, the fruit was fresh, potatoes were crisp but not greasy.  All in all, the service was great, the place was clean, food was egg-ceptional, and the atmosphere was fast paced but not rushed- which is important if you've got places to be. Will definitely be returning next time I'm in the area",

From the moment we walked in we were greeted by a very friendly lady. Had us seated in no-time flat. Then we met our waitress, Candice, (if you get her, you are amazingly lucky). She was the nicest, coolest waitress I've ever had the pleasure of meeting. She was very attentive and friendly. Not the \"I'm being paid\" kinda friendly. Actually friendly. I had the waffle works with whipped cream and strawberries. My husband had the Cabo burrito. They were amazingly delicious! The over all experience was so pleasant we plan on going back. Next time with friends and family. Thank you again to Candice and the eggworks crew.",

I ordered the Fried Chicken Skillet, and I want to say that it is the BEST brunch I have ever ordered! It was just so flavorful. However the gravy on my chicken had a bit too much sodium. The first few bites was mouthwatering but towards the end the sodium got to me. Nevertheless; everything else was very good and the price was reasonable for what I have ordered. I would love to come back here again if I can. I wished they had this in New York. I have yet to find a good brunch spot in New York.",

Food:  Mexixan crepe (half portion @ 7.05)  -chorizos and good stuff..yumm and filling! grateful that it was half and not overly stuffed (thank you ashley!)  Side of bacon (3pcs @ 3.60) -hard to go wrong with bacon..  Loco Moco (9.25) -gravy over eggs meat and rice good but filling... (i need kimchi with this)  Banana nut muffin (side with dishes) -at first i thought it was a bit dry.. til Ashley showed me the way with butter.. (but anything with butter makes everything better ) turned out to be moist with flavor! hey its a new magic trick!  overall food and service was great! ashley showed the way gave opinions and answered little questions we asked.

It was soooooooo good! $13+ A veggie omelette w/ spinach, mushrooms, artichoke, Swiss cheese and topped with feta cheese and fresh tomatoes.  I even added avocado to it..... writing this is making my mouth water!  This dish would have been great for two, but I was able to finish it myself since it was a social event with my girls I kept stuffing this belly. Instead of potatoes, I asked for rice and l left 1 scoop of rice behind.  The girls had groupons which they had to pay separately. From an even $50 Bill, we paid a total of $13+!!!!!!!!!!!

    "text": "Ok... this was my second visit. I liked this place before, I love it now! Both times I was here the place was busy. Especially if you consider it was during the week, before the time for a 'lunch rush'. Being busy is a good sign that the place is good! . Our server, Marc, was fantastic. He was patient, courteous, and friendly. He answered our questions and was generally helpful.  The food was top notch. I got the corned beef and eggs breakfast. The quantity of food made it more than worth the $11+ cost. My partner has the 'island favorite' which was two thick slices of grilled spam, eggs, and sticky rice. He thought it was really good.  In summary, Egg Works. Even though it's slightly higher cost than some, is on my list of great places to eat and I highly recommend it.",

    "text": "This is the second time I've been here and I was invited back by the owner. He was courteous enough to send me a gift card to come back. We were greeted and quickly seated right as we entered the doors. Unfortunately, I sat there for a good 10 minutes just for the waiter to come and take my orders for drinks. Alongside with this, it is not busy at all. I don't understand why it took them this long to come and take my order for some water. We flipped the egg to a sad face and finally, someone who was NOT the waiter at my area, came and got us water. Our waiter didn't come until 15 minutes later after being seated. I was very disappointed already. Afterwards, she took our orders(didn't introduce herself at all) and doesn't even come back with the food. Someone else came and brought us our food(which keep in mind, took forever). I ordered the NY steak again and this time, I thought it was going to be a lot better. I ordered medium rare so I was hoping the cook was right this time. However, we didn't get to eat until 6 minutes later. We both kept raising our hands and our waiter looked at us, then looked away. Is she purposely ignoring us or something? She went up to the table near us and brought them a bottle of ketchup and I called for her...still no response. Her name is Brandy by the way. The person who noticed us was Fernando and he was the table cleaner. He was the only one who helped and asked if we needed anything else. He also brought us the A1 sauce. Big shout out to Fernando, their table cleaner. I feel like they are not credited enough since they've done more than the waitress/waiters have had. We began eating and everything was good. My sunny side up eggs were delicious and the toast was the best. But then I got to the steak and was fairly disappointed AGAIN!!! The steak was SO DRY. I took a picture and you can see how there is no juice whatsoever. It's just oily and dry. Big disappointment and VERY upsetting. My boyfriend ordered the Steak benny this time. ANOTHER DISAPPOINTMENT!!! After he broke open the egg, it turns out they were undercooked. White liquid gushed out of the eggs. That means the whites of the eggs were not even cooked. It would be okay if they were cloudy but you can clearly see they were just clear. Now we question why this place is top rated when they can't even cook their eggs properly. We understand bennies need to be partially raw. But this was just really pure raw. I have pictures for proof. Just look at them...After the food, we complained to the waitress and she didn't really seem to caring. In fact, she was trying to back herself up saying things like how shes busy with the new chefs in training so she wasn't able to cater us much. Also said something like how she came back twice...but she only came back twice after I gave her the bitch face since i was sitting there for 20 minutes not being able to eat.  THERE WASN'T EVEN MANY PEOPLE THERE!!! It was like less than 7 tables being used! We told her how we most likely won't be coming back and she says: \"Sounds good!\"  Wow. I am astounded by the customer service here. I mean, at least this time the cashier wasn't a total bitch. I'm not coming back. It's just too disappointing since I actually enjoy eating at egg and I on Sahara and Eggworks on Fortapache.",

I wasn't aware that they offer half sizes, so I could only eat about a third of my meal.  No complaints there though! The variety of dishes offered was fantastic. No matter what you're looking for or craving, this place will hit the spot.   I got the Works Skillet and my coworker had the Works Omelette. My skillet was fantastic and, like I mentioned above, huge. The potatoes were hands-down the best part of the meal. My coworker liked his omelette and said the banana nut muffin was great as well   My only complaint is that everything was a tad too salty. I'm fine with some extra salt, but when the butter on my toast is too salty, then it's a little bit of a letdown.",

The pancakes were very good though, and seemed about right in size (I got a short stack with 2). The place felt sorta like a fast food joint too (again, part of a \"typical\" Vegas regular food joint). If you like getting a lot of food for a reasonable price, this place might be for you.

But the secret is out so if you get there for a weekend brunch -- you're going to have to wait.  The homemade banana muffins are always warm and delicious and the breakfast menu is expansive (and includes non-egg items for those who don't eat eggs).  The food portions are gigantic -- so come hungry!  The small omelette order with the seasoned potatoes is more than enough for me, but I think my favorite thing I've had is the stuffed french toast.  It's scrambled eggs, cheese, sausage, sandwiched between two pieces of french toast, served with syrup on the side.  To die for!!  Both my brother and I think this might be our favorite dish, even if you can only have it a few times a year.  If you're in doubt, the seasoned potatoes are delicious, and get the muffin.  Leave all diets at the door and just gorge yourselves!!!  I am looking forward to my next visit with anticipation.  Definitely give it a shot!",

With some recommendations from a friend who is a local from the Las Vegas area, this place is very highly recommended. And for myself, I would recommend and will definitely return when I am back in the area.  We got here way early before the morning rush, about 7 am. Easily found park and got seated in no time. It is very homey inside, with dining tables and a breakfast bar with additional seating. Our servers were very attentive, making sure we had everything we needed.  For those who love coffee (like me), their coffee is unlimited!! Yes that's right, they even give you the entire mug of coffee pourer to have at your table. And if you like flavored coffee, they have small creamers available at the table too.   For food, I got the veggie Benedict with their homemade potatoes. The veggies on top of the english muffin were avocados, tomatoes, and spinach. Everyone tasted too good! My favorite were probably their homemade potatoes. It had a cajun taste and it was not oily or soggy at all, unlike most homestyle potatoes. Some of the smaller potatoes were even had a little crunch to it. My boyfriend got the country fried steak, which he said was very good. I got to taste the gravy that was on top and yes it was very tasty!  Their menu is fairly large so next time I come back I will definitely try something new, maybe even a lunch item!",

I had the chicken fried steak skillet, which was a HUGE portion with eggs, potatoes, country-fried steak and gravy. Wow, it was so good! It was perfectly seasoned. I couldn't even get through half of it, even though I really wanted to. The seasoning took it over the top...it was very good and very well-seasoned but not too much so. That's a thin line!  The banana nut muffins are to die for! You can buy a whole loaf of it, and I was very tempted, but there's so much to eat here in Las Vegas!  Our server was sweet and provided us with excellent service.  A must-do!",

I contacted her and she was nice enough to even give me the address to this restaurant. Our family enjoys breakfast type restaurants so we wanted to go to this establishment.  When you walk into the restaurant they hand you a menu that resembles a newspaper. The pages are all filled with different choices - breakfast items. I chose the Works Veggie Benny, my son got the Waffle with strawberries and whipped cream and my wife got Seasoned Center Cut New York Steak with Eggs. My order and my son's order were really great. I never had a Veggie Benny before and it was very good. My wife asked the steak to be well done and it came out not so well done. Other than that the food was really good. The day we went their computer system failed so everything seemed to be chaotic, they were manually doing everything. Our family is understanding so we could kinda tell they were having problems. No worries...... Overall the food was really good. The servers kept apologizing for the computer system failure. The restaurant was very busy, the establishment is clean and there is plenty of parking. The service was friendly. If in Las Vegas we would go back.",

This place is freakin' delicious && I highly recommend.   From the moment we walked in, to the moment we paid our bill I felt very welcomed by the staff, who are genuinely nice!   The food was quickly prepared, then quickly eaten, lol. My hubby ordered the waffles, with a couple eggs and bacon on the side. I appreciate how they brought this out as soon as it was made so that he was able to enjoy the waffles while they were still fresh and hot! Other places would let it sit under heat lamps and bring it out when all the food was done, but not this place- this place is actually thoughtful and considerate! My gf and I ordered the delicious loco moco. Dude, this dish is aaaaaaHmazing! The gravy that's smothered throughout the beef patty is so tasty and add that all up plus my over easy runny egg- boom, you have a heavenly sent dish! So good!   Egg Works delivers and I would totally eat here again!",

    "text": "Alright.... alright.... alright!!!!!! Crazy to say but this is my first review of 2018. Yes, I've been slacking BUT...... I'm on the constant grind and sometimes Yelp has to take a backseat but I still got love for you. Now let's get into this review.   Stopped in here on a Sunday morning in between sessions of a conference I was attending. Now.... it being Vegas... and breakfast time.... and Sunday... we knew it would be crowded but the wait wasn't that bad. It took about 20-25 minutes to be seated for two. I'm calling that a win in my book.  Now, the one smidge I would say is that it took maybe 7 minutes or so for initial contact but the manger came by to check on us so it was all good. (I chalk that up to being as crowded as I stated, but not so bad that we wanted to leave. My friend and I were talking and looking at the massive menu anyway).   The place definitely has a down home feel to it with farm murals on the walls. Diner style seating and regular tables.   Now I won't get into the depths of the menu but... think of pretty much any breakfast item and they have it... including crepes (yes crepes and yes the French ones lol. Don't get me started on that smh). But the menu is large and in charge.   I personally went with \"The Works\" omelette with potatoes (legit) and wheat toast with a banana nut muffin (YELP CHECK IN ITEM). My friend went with steak and eggs. I partially wanted to strangle her because she ordered her steak well done.... but.... I remember where I was when I first started eating steak. I didn't grow up in a Household that ordered it any other way. So it took time to work my way to a medium rare. So I partially forgive but partially don't lol. She seemed to enjoy it. And we shared French toast which was divine... soft, fluffy, moist with hot syrup. Man... my mouth waters for that. Service was solid after initial wait. Overall we had a nice experience, even on a crowded Sunday.  This place is definitely on my list to visit again next time I'm in town... which will be October. #FrenchToastGang",

Being that my wife loves salty food for breakfast and sweet stuff for me, this place was perfect.  She ordered the Loco Moco and I ordered Hawaiian Toast.  My wife really enjoyed the Loco Moco. I enjoyed my Hawaiian Toast.  Overall great meal.    I think what I really enjoyed most was the customer service from the wait staff.  They also had this system where you flip a colored sign at your table to indicate that you need service or help.  We didn't have to use it because our wait staff was great but I can see how this is helpful during busy hours.  Recommended!",

I ordered a club ranch wrap without tomatoes.  It was a lot of food but I didn't care much for the cheese or the ranch dressing, too runny and sour.  Two members of my party ordered the BLTs and we're happy.  The BLTs had a ton of bacon on them.  Another member of our party had the pancakes and we both thought they tasted more like KFC biscuits than pancakes.  Lastly, someone had the cheeseburger and they thought it was awful.  They said it tasted like they put chopped onions and oatmeal or some other type of filler in it.  They may serve up a mean egg breakfast, but I don't think I'll be going back to find out.",

The server, seemed ok, but I could tell that some of her surrounding tables, were agitated. (Shoulda known). Server took our order & most of the food came in a timely manner - most...The server dropped the food she had & took off - not asking if we needed anything else. I noticed my silverware had dried food debris - so I had to wait to have a staff member bring my a clean set. Also the fruit garnish - which I admit I dont usually eat - the pineapple slice was rotten (I took a pic to show I wasn't exaggerating). But the most irritating thing was that the server FORGOT to put in the order for one of my daughters so she sat for almost ten min with nothing - the server - while apologetic, didn't seem sincere. Maybe because I overheard her apologize to four other tables for similar mistakes - Heres an observation - if she would have done her job correctly in the first place - she wouldnt have to apologize. So she brings the meal - then wants to chit chat while we're eating - she just butt into a conversation that had nothing to do with her...Really??? I'm not the type looking for free things but when I make a mistake - I would comp the guest the item that was in question - instead she brings a loaf of banana bread - which we didnt order or ask for in lieu of a discount I dont get to go out to breakfast with my family often as I used to  - so it is a special event for me. So when I pick someplace for breakfast I expect something close to perfection....SADLY DISAPPOINTED",

    "text": "This is my favorite breakfast place in Las Vegas!  They have a variety of food on their menu but the best items to order from is their \"Local/Island Menu\" which includes their Portuguese sausage, eggs & rice.  They give you the whole sausage; not just a couple of pieces so it's great! Oh & can't forget their banana nut muffin that comes with the meal (or you can get toast); it is DELICIOUS!! It's freshly baked so it's warm and moist.  The atmosphere of the restaurant is very cute. Everything is barn themed with egg designs. The servers are friendly and the food comes out quick! And not to mention this place is decently priced. They used to have a lot of coupons in the local vegas magazines so it would make your meals even cheaper!",

I was unable to finish it, maybe because I stuffed a muffin... I mean \"tasted\" a full muffin before the main course ;) Ricky our server was awesome!",

The outside of the building appears as if it would be a poor quality restaurant inside but I was pleasantly surprised when I walked in.  The ambience was high energy (as a busy breakfast spot usually is).  I called in advance and put my name on the list and they seated me almost immediately.    The service was excellent.  Wait staff was very prompt and friendly.  I ordered a breakfast burrito and my wife got steak and eggs (we always split our two meals).  Both dishes were amazing.  The steak was extremely tender and served with egg whites on the side (per our request).  The breakfast burrito was a 10/10, filled with eggs, peppers, bacon, and sausage.    The most impressive part of eggs works was their home made salsa!  It was actually so good that I bought a jar upfront (very reasonably priced at 4 dollars.    I'm very impressed with egg works and will probably go back sometime this week.",

On a Sunday morning we waited about 20 minutes for a table, but once you get your table they really keep things moving. Our waiter took our drink orders right away and returned with them quickly. We ordered and again our waiter returned ridiculously fast with our pre-breakfast muffins. We barely had time to finish our muffins when breakfast arrived. While we were eating I saw the staff turn a table after a large party left like a Nascar pit crew. The whole staff really hustles in the morning.  The actual menu is huge. They have everything from unique scrambles to pancakes to benedicts. The muffins they bring before the meal are both delicious and moist. I had the mashed potato omelet which has mashed potatoes, bacon, cheese, onions, and sour cream. It was yummy, but not the most exciting option they offer. My husband had the chili omelet with chili and cheese. This was definitely even better than my omelet very tasty.  This is a good spot if you like a hearty breakfast with unique options.",

The best part was that I didn't even notice waiting for our food because it got there so quickly. I thought the Habla Diablo potatoes were going to be  spicy, but it is just their way of saying they are seasoned, they were perfect and super fresh!  I got the 6 ounce steak. It wasn't the best steak I've ever had. I wish they offered a size larger than 6 ounces, but if you filled my egg and steak craving. I'm quite picky about my scrambled eggs, these are the best scrambled eggs I've had in a while, even better than my own!   My husband got the country fried steak. He obviously loved it, because he didn't share any of it with me!   I totally love this location! It's not close to where I live, but if I were on this side of town, I would definitely go here! Also, The banana nut muffins are so delicious.   Thanks Donna for the amazing service!",

Saturday morning, parking lot spaces closest to the entrance were all full. No problem, drove around and three spaces opened up within minutes.   We walked in and were greeted immediately at the host stand. We were seated at a table and told that our server would be right with us. Before we could finish settling into our seats, our server Donna stopped by to get our drink order. (Wow! That was fast.)  Donna came back with our drink order and chatted for a few minutes before giving us time to decide on our order. While waiting I looked around and watched as Donna interacted with others around us. She was truly genuine, professional and friendly with others. I believe that the majority of employees at almost every Egg Works location I have been to share the same traits. It always makes for a pleasant dining experience.   Overall, it's a great local breakfast spot that we enjoy going to again and again.",

We arrived around 12:45 and they weren't busy at all, which is always a plus when I have time constraints.   Service was friendly and our food came out at lightning speed. I got the avocado and bacon omelette with wheat toast and cottage cheese. I ordered the cottage cheese since I really don't like the potatoes they are famous for but I was a little disappointed to find out that they put that same paprika or whatever it is on the cottage cheese so I'll have to make sure I tell them to skip the seasoning on my next visit. The omelette was good albeit a little too much cheese was added for my personal taste. Another thing I'll have to be a little more careful with how I order my meal for the next time.   Overall our meal was good and very basic for a breakfast.",

    "text": "Today was my first time ever going to their  chain restaurant and I was impressed for several reasons.   Today happen to be Father's Day and my Dad decided to check this place out. We went and of course not only is it a Sunday morning but it's a Sunday Morning on Father's Day. The line was insane! I was worried because I only had 1.5 hours before I had to go into work. As soon as I saw the line my first though was \"This place better be worth it\" and \" I better be seated fast\". Once we reached the receptionist my name was at the bottom of the list to be called but they were constantly calling people to be seated and it only took max 10 minutes to be seated. I was highly impressed. I have never gotten faster service than I have at this place. We were seated at a booth that was a little snug for my family but it was still comfortable enough to eat in. I was surprised that the receptionist kept checking up on us to make sure that we were comfortable and even offered to give us a different table which was completely unnecessary. It was nice to have that sense that everyone in the restaurant wanted to make sure you were happy with not only your meal but the experience as well.  I ordered the Ruben sandwich which might not be the best breakfast choice but I thought it was delicious.  My parents tried the tostadas and they were HUGE and could probably feed two. Their chocolate chip pancakes were also really tasty. I am not a real big fan of breakfast food in general but after trying this place I definitely will reconsider my lack of appreciation for breakfast food. If you are looking for a casual, tasty and decently priced place I highly recommend this one.",

Not only do they have breakfast, but also a good lunch menu. I have the \"Chili Skillet\" with \"Cincinnati Style\" chili. I am from Cincinnati. I can tell you, this is really authentic Cincy style chili. When combined with scrambled eggs and potatoes and cheese with awesome spices, this is one of the best dishes I've had. Also, the servers are really good and friendly. Great business plan, great service, awesome place to go.",

Shantel was our server and was awesome. I always judge good service by not having to ask for a refill, which I never had to with her. She also made a good recommendation for their green salsa which was very delish!  I had the corned beef hash and husband had an omelet. We also split blueberry pancakes - yummy! The meal totally hit the spot. It's a cool atmosphere and doesn't feel touristy (even though we were-lol). We will most definitely be back the next time or even again on our trip.

All of the staff members were very friendly from the minute we walked in. My steak was served before her french toast... her order didn't come until about 5 minutes or so after I received mine. Food was good and the manager along with our waitress apologized repeatedly for her plate being a little bit late. We didn't mind because the food was good, but the manager went over and above and comped our entire meal. The luxury of a family owned restaurant unlike an Ihop where they would've offered me a free muffin or coffee as an apology. We would visit this restaurant again and we recommend trying it out!",

Today I had the Works Veggie Benny...I am so grateful to our waitress who told me I could get a half or a full order.  I got the half...and I am still full like 7 hours later!  It was a beautiful English muffin with grilled tomato, fresh spinach and avocado plus a poached egg and hollandaise.  It came with a huge side of super hot, wonderfully seasoned breakfast potatoes...no grease or mush or anything - crispy and yummy!  My guests had pancakes and scrambled eggs - a plain short stack was enough for 3 people and the eggs were cooked perfectly.  Drinks were refilled and the waitress left the entire pitcher of coffee on the table for our one coffee drinker!  This is a fun place to go with a group - and they weren't busy on a random Wednesday around 9 AM.  I am soooo full from my half order but I would definitely return!",

(order a side of salsa to make it more unique) 2) FRENCH TOAST: Three pieces of Texas toast or four pieces of Cinnamon Raisin toast dipped in homemade batter and grilled golden brown, then dusted with powdered sugar. It is served with Works apples,and warm syrup. 3) CORN BEEF HASH topped with two eggs any style and served with Works potatoes, and your choice of toast or banana nut muffin.  *The Work's potatoes were tasty and the banana nut muffin was a real treat!",

    "text": "Okay buckle up here we go.  I'm a first timer and couldn't have been seated in a more perfect section.  My first impression was not corporate at all very friendly and roomy. I'm a pretty big guy and never felt stuffed (no pun intended) . My server was Danielle aka. Dani, a gorgeous young lady with a bubbly personality and very knowledgeable about the food. We talked for a second I explained it was my first time here and right away she offered me a free banana nut muffin. Now my mom makes the best banana nut bread and for the first time in my 45 years of living I must confess. .. mom they got you on this one sorry.  I still love you though. So with the help of Dani we decided to go with center cut pork cops and eggs scrambled with pepper jack cheese and potatoes on the side with coffee and an English muffin.  Food came very quickly for such a busy place,  over all the food was great, however I am somewhat of a foodie so here's my critique. For a center cut pork chop it was a little on the thin side and for my personal taste a slight bit over seasoned. If you like meat for breakfast like I do,  i think their steak and eggs would be a more flavorful choice.  The eggs were cooked perfect and tasted amazing, and a big surprise was the house coffee ahhhh-mazzzzz-ingly deeeeeeeeeeeeeelicous. Over all i gave them a 4 start rating only because they don't have 4 and 1/2 star rating.  The half off was solely the seasoning for my personal taste.  After eating and thoroughly enjoying my breakfast Dani offered me a muffin to go (sorry mom I had to take it.) Overall food 4 1/2 stars, overall look and cleanliness 5 star and as far as service goes Dani knocked this one out of the park a perfect 10.  Thanks Dani for a wonderful breakfast experience. I will definitely be back and will bring friends,  thank you Dani an egg works.",

Despite it being rather crowded, service was great, staff was frendly and we didn't have to wait long for a table, love that!  It can get rather loud so if your looking for a quiet place for breakfast, probably not the best choice.

Tely was our waitress and was so nice and helped us choose what to order because the menu is very extensive! It was 10am on a Friday and the place was packed, but we never felt rushed. My husband's omelet came missing something and Tely and the manager went above and beyond to correct it, gave us a coupon, and muffins to go. The food was awesome (I got the county Benny and hubs got the chicken omelet and the banana nut muffins - amazing!), but the customer service is what really stood out. We will definitely be back next time we're in Vegas!!",

The huge plate of biscuits and gravy was too huge and the pale gravy looked gross. How sorry would I have been if I didn't dig into those biscuits and gravy. That food was DELICIOUS! and I don't usually do gravy. Oh and I also had scrambled eggs. I've never not been able to eat an order of scrambled eggs before. But I couldn't eat what seemed to be a dozen scrambled eggs. They were perfectly scrambled and so beautifully textured -- not hard and dry but moist and solid. The Old Bay seasoned hash browns deliciously completed the trinity.  EW loses 1-star because of the non-dairy creamer.",

So, I just don't understand people willing to wait 30+ minutes to eat an omelet or another equally rudimentary breakfast food. So, on a handful of occasions when the wait time was not ridiculous I've had a chance to try this place. They have a large menu and their service is solid. I am also a fan of the endless coffee refills.  I have had their basic eggs breakfast, sampled several of the omelets, and most recently highly enjoyed their carnitas rancheros menu item. Everything is fine, and that is pretty much the most you can expect out of these joints...hence why I don't understand the hype or the wait times.  The food is fine, the prices are fine, the service is fine...is it worth waiting 30+ minutes for? Heck no.",

    "text": "We park in a lot of a semi-shopping center that looks as if it's prime was in the late 80's and early 90's maybe, and is now a bit run down. We see a tacky \"Egg Works\" sign, and to me it looked like one of those restaurants that tries really hard, but just isn't that good. However, according to Yelp, it's a pretty good place, and so we walk in. We are greeted by tacky decor - it's a pseudo country-farm experience with the tables and newspaper menu - the theme is apparent, but the aesthetic and curb appeal just aren't all the way there yet.  A group of three, we get seated in a nice, comfy booth, which is terrific after a 10hour overnight drive. Named appropriately, they have the works when it comes to dishes with eggs. We peruse the extensive newspaper menu of everything from pancakes, waffles, french toast, omelets, eggs benedict, scrambles, skillets, crepes, salads, burgers, and even an egg substitute, if you don't like eggs but chose to eat at a restaurant called Egg Works...  Anyway, we make our decision. A skillet, and omelet, and country fried steak and eggs. We get all sorts of options for toast, and are greeted with bright and friendly service.  Overall, a good breakfast experience. It was the only full and solid meal we ended up having that day, and it was filling. You are certainly breaking fast with a meal at Egg Works. Anything you order is one hell of a meal!",

They entire staff is very attentive and professional. The customer service is impeccable.

We never were checked on by our waitress, we stopped another waiteress to find out the status of our meal.

They cooked everything with seasoning salt andthen doused everything with seasoning salt, including the potatoes and hollandaise sauce, once it's on the plates.  I thought it was just my food but I looked at other people's plates around me and they had the same thing going on.  This place uses a ton of seasoning salt so I do not recommend you eat here if you have an intolerance for salt, or if you have already met your salt intake limit for the next 3 months. Also, I ordered the blackened prime rib.  It is not a blackened slice of prime rib.  It is chopped up leftover meat that is completely saturated in... you guessed right! Seasoning salt.  There were definitely some good things and I give one star for each of them: the atmosphere was very upbeat and fun. The place is clean and the decorations are appealing.  The staff was super awesome, too. Very friendly, attentive and fast.  I hope the next time I'm in Vegas I will have time to give This place a second chance on the food. But next time around, I will be sure to ask for 'no salt'.",

Our waitress was very nice and help us make a decision on our order since the menu is gigantic and had sooo many choices. I got the egg benny (there are 5 different benny's to choose from), and my friend got the skillet also 5 different ones to choose from. The variety is great if you like lots and lots of choices. Best part is that breakfast is served pretty much all day, so for those of us that love their eggie stuff, you can still get that in the afternoon.   The portions are huge! Neither of us could finish our food. Do not expect anything super healthy here as everything is made to taste good which they do. Bathrooms are clean, parking was easy to find.",

Food portions are very large.  Excellent food and service for a reasonable price. Highly recommend.",

I don't usually review a place after only one visit but in this case I'll make the exception because we probably won't be back for a year. When we do come back, I'll suggest this place to the peeps because it really was that good. Loved the menu and walked away with an Egg Works coffee mug.  My only criticism comes in because they have buckwheat pancakes on the menu, which I love. However, when I asked if they were gluten free (I'm a glutard) the server had to go away to find out. On return she said no, they have wheat. WTF?! In this day and age with so many glutards out there, you have to be somewhat accommodating. I know there are many other gluten-free options on the menu, but there were no pancakes and I had a hankerin' for pancakes. This is the only reason they lost a star.  My veggie omelet was excellent and really enjoyed the potatoes. My mate had a very traditional type breakfast with eggs over easy and sourdough toast. We both very much enjoyed our breakfast.  In the end, I can only say that we loved the place and will be back next time around. The only thing I would suggest is a little more attention to detail and to try to do something for those with common food restrictions. Other than that, excellent.",

The works potatoes are seasoned diced potatoes.    I got the veggie skillet.... layer of \"works potatoes\" fresh spinach, tomatoes, 2 eggs over easy. I left off the onions and had the cheddar jack cheese on the side. Comes with fruit slices and choice of toat or muffin. I opted for dry wheat toast and added whipped butter later so I could gauge how much was on the the toast.",

Upon being led to a 2-seater table in the middle of the walkway in the restaurant, I politely asked if we could sit in a 4-seater on the side of the room. The restaurant was not filled. The young brunette hostess told us that she is \"NOT ALLOWED TO SEAT 2 PEOPLE IN 4-SEATERS ON A SATURDAY MORNING.\" Being that I was with my 78 year old non-confrontational Asian Mother, I did not persist in asking for another table. Our server was very sweet, as all the servers have been in my past 4-5 visits to Egg Works.   As we filled our stomachs with hot coffee, I became more and more lucid and then noticed that the 4-seater tables to the left of us and behind us had two people at each of them. I then observed Miss Hostess bringing another couple to a 4-seater across from me. The restaurant NEVER filled up while we were there.   Yeah, the banana muffin is pretty delicious after a long plane ride, but I'll think twice about going to this Egg Works next time I'm in town and go some place else--hopefully, where I'm treated like everyone else.",

I love sitting on the patio so my son can enjoy the planes landing. It totally makes the outside experience! And it has enough roof coverage to create shade so your not basking in the sun.   I normal get the veggie benny, it's my favorite! It's served on an English muffin with spinach tomato and avocado with their home made hollandaise with their fresh potatoes on the side that are generously seasoned. I get this every time I come here, I am a creature of habit! BUT today I switched things up as we came later in the day and got the veggie pesto grilled sandwich! And that was delicious as well! With grilled zucchini, squash, tomatoes and peppers served on a grilled bread with pesto and topped with mozzarella!! It was so good, and I got it with their shoe string fries which were crunchy and crispy and seasoned like there potatoes! It was great!   So if you can manage to wait a little for a table I would recommend eating here, if you can wait a little longer, watching the planes land while enjoying delicious food and hot coffee is always a good start to the day!!",

We were told it be a 30 minute wait however it was more like a 10 minute wait. The food here sure beats any Denny's or Ihop. I ordered a cheeseburger with fries and it was so juicy and delicious. The fries were skinny and crispy with some paprika/chili powder seasoning on them. The portions are huge. I forgot what the other girls ordered but they all enjoyed their meals. Great spot to hit in the morning if you have a hangover or just want some breakfast food or lunch savory food :)",

    "text": "I returned to Egg Works to give them one last chance. I ordered the chili relleno omelette which used to be one of my favorite dishes on the menu. Sadly no more. This time the Poblano was full of seeds and handle was still on the pepper. The pepper handle I'll accept but even lowly Roberto's Taco Shop (the last bullet on the canonero's bandolier of Mexican fast food) removes the seeds from their Poblano peppers. It was like having a mouth full of lady bugs. And like a drunken Irishmen (redundant, yes I know) at last call, the dish demanded more sauce. Dispirited by two-thirds of the breakfast on my plate, I sought solace in the hash browns since the first metaphorical contestant on Family Feud's Big Money scored so disappointingly low. But to my dismay the initial ooze out of the ketchup bottle was an ebb-tide of feculent ketchup water, that pink-hued, semi-translucent liquid that looks like something you'd find in your bathroom sink after flossing too hard, or perhaps the rose-colored consequence of a reckless colonoscopy. It doesn't take the impatience and raspy voice of Sergeant Hank Voight to know Egg Work's ownership requires their staff to combine ketchup bottle contents together, known as \"marrying ketchups,\" a veritable game misconduct penalty if health code violations were described in NHL metaphor. This means that the ketchup in the bottle jammed in the breakfast cafe condiment caddie could theoretically contain ketchup that predates the Internet. In civilized society, people should get married, not ketchup bottles and their inanimate contents. The Poblano seeds, pepper necks, and Duran Duran rookie-year ketchup infection water made this meal unrecoverable, despite good service. So unlike the time traveling T-800 Android assassin: a cybernetic organism, living tissue over a metal endoskeleton, tasked with terminating Sarah Connor in 1984, I won't be back.",

Driving up to the building we noticed a line forming and knew that it must be a winner.  We got seated fairly quickly and our waitress Donna was very quick and friendly. We had a never ending stream of drinks and some free muffins since it was our first time here!  After we got our food it wasn't hard to see why people were raving about this place. It was all very awesome!  The portions are huge and reasonably priced. The kitchen did mess up one of our orders but they quickly fixed the bill and gave us a whole loaf of banana bread for the inconvenience!!!   This will for sure be a place we will come back to. Next time we are in town!   Donna really did make this a great experience!",

The manager was nice and took one meal off our ticket and gave us a loaf of bread to take home with us. So they did their best the rectify the situation but it was frustrating to wait that long. I got the Sundance omelet and it was delicious!!! I also ordered the homestyle pancakes and they were really yummy! My husbands french toast was good too.",

Special shoutout to my waitress Tely....who was fantastic. Great service, always checking up on me. Brought over the whipped cream (not part of the menu) and said add this. 5/5 for Tely's service.  Place was pretty busy for Noon on a Saturday, so again I found counter space for a quick sit down. I needed food to replenish my body after a 4 mile hike. They have a full menu with everything from eggs, crepes, benedicts, sandwiches, etc.   Located on the corner of Sunset and Eastern across from Sunset Park.",

We stopped here before going to hike Red Rock, and for a pre-hike breakfast, this was definitely more than enough.   Food: I had the veggie skillet and another friend had the croissant breakfast sandwich. Both came with potatoes, which were a little dry. Veggie skillet is really big - could be breakfast enough for two people - and super filling, mostly because you get so many potatoes. The croissant bfast sandwich was also huge. But it's not a gourmet brunch by any means, and because the potatoes are dry, I'd say it's a little below typical diner breakfasts at a similar or a bit higher price point. My free banana nut muffin with check-in was so incredibly moist, it was amazing. Unlimited coffee refills!  Ambiance: Fast casual; our server was Sy and she was very attentive, speedy and helpful.",

It was a 10-15 minute wait for a table but found 2 spots at the bar right away. We had the funniest and most upbeat server at the bar, I think his name was PK. He kept us laughing the entire time we were there. The rest of the crew was nice and they looked happy to be there! I ordered a mimosa - they give you your own little bottle of champagne with a side of OJ to mix yourself which is great as I only prefer a small amount of OJ. We also got 2 free banana muffins which were to die for.  And the food! So good! It came out super fast and hot. The veggie Benny was amazing as well as the Mexican omelette.   HIGHLY recommend.",

We told her that we haven't been here before and instead of selling us their top dishes or specialties of the house, she just said \"ok I will be back.\" Really!!!  Food is ok. Way better food and less expensive at other breakfast places. Hubby's chicken fried steak tasted processed. You can't make that fresh?  Server gave us our bill right after she dropped off our food. Even though you say \"take your time\", you might as well have told me to hurry and eat. I need that table!!!   Don't like the concept of the yellow and black egg when you need something. It makes the servers lazy and not work for their tip.  You still need to check on your customers even though they might not need something from the kitchen.   Food was ok. Worst customer service experience.  Sorry. She seemed new.  And if she wasn't, please help her!!!",

The decor is cozy and comfy like grandmas kitchen. We had The traditional Benny and the Ensenada burrito, both were superb! We will definitely be coming back as regulars. Great spot. The habla Diablo sauce is a must have. Thank you so much to Danielle for making the experience great!!",

    "text": "It's weird how things happen.   I was reading the reviews about Egg Works on Wed and Thurs as something I really wanted to try on Friday.  I didn't mention it to anyone at work but that's what they decided on doing for Friday lunch.  I was actually impressed.  Real spacious and nicely decorated barn look!? like the entrance to the restrooms.  There's outside dining area, a kinda private room for large groups, a breakfast counter for solo diners, TV's, WIFI.  Service was quick, it wasn't that busy because it was a later lunch.  So it looks like most of their menu were breakfast dishes since it doesn't look to be open for dinner. Most of the dishes looked really good and were large portions. I had the Spinach Benny which was really delicious but didn't care for the sides, a slice of grape fruit and pineapple, with some Works potatoes. Server hooked me up with a pretty good banana muffin which I didn't order.  Someone had the pancakes which seemed a good portion but heard it taste pretty basic. Others had the corn beef hash and some other really good looking breakfast dishes, I'll definitely be back to try more of the menu.  I found a BOGO coupon online at Las Vegas Review Journal website <a href=\"/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2Flvrj.com&s=968bae244a64354c2f7cbe70396499d1ef7c6c83b7d2e87c0aab2e7b5d44583d\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">lvrj.com</a> and printed a bunch for our large group.  They said they don't usually honor these printed coupons unless they come straight from the newspaper but they honor it this time.  I'll probably be going to the other locations and see if they'll also honor the coupon or not.",

    "text": "Our 1st Yelp failure. MAJOR Yelp failure. So sad. Quite possibly the worst breakfast we've ever had!  Pro: Delicious Banana Nut Muffins. 1 son liked his eggs & bacon, but said potatoes were ok.  Cons: Corned Beef Hash tasted like mushy cat food. Are a few bites & couldn't choke down any more. Potatoes are odd & over seasoned. Husbands omelet was edible enough for him to eat 2/3, but he said it was just ok. Kids pancake wasn't even good. :/   Our kids asked if we could give it a \"0\" or 1/2 Star. 1 star is for the tasty muffin...which was the only enjoyable part of our $40+ breakfast.  Such a bummer!",

The location is bigger than the other one, and they seem to get people in and out.  They have plenty of TV's and, being Sunday, it was a great place to watch the NFL and have brunch with the family. Unfortunately I'm not into football, but I still enjoyed my breakfast: the pork chops and eggs.  Its 2, thin cut pork chops, cooked perfectly served with the home fries and 2 eggs, and toast, or, their muffin.  Knowing they have large portions, I opted for english muffin.  Stephen had the Cincinnati chili omelette and his mom had the Stuffed French Toast, which was stuffed with eggs and bacon.  HUGE.. where we took 1/2 of it home.  Overall a great meal, and even better that we had a groupon.  It beats eating at the Strip, and we dine where the locals eat.",

I ordered the \"Works\" skillet that included eggs, fried potatoes,  onions,  mushrooms,  green peppers, ham and sausage. Very tasty.  Add some black pepper for some subtle spiciness and you're golden.   As for the service; it's wonderful. Donna was our server for the day and she was very courteous to our needs. Really great service from her.  The only reason I did not give a 5 star rating was because of the pancakes that I ordered. I always order pancakes for every meal. My dissatisfaction was that their batter does not seem fresh. The only way I knew that it wasn't,  was because the pancakes were very tough to cut. My only assumption is that the batter is already pre made throughout the entire day and thus the gluten is already activated and hardened. I believe the goal to a good pancake is to NOT premake the batter and just make a fresh new batter for every pancakes order requested.",

It's little pieces of steak on top of a croissant with perfectly cooked eggs. We also got a sample of the chili which was also delicious so we decided to order it to go since we were stuffed. It doesn't seem like you can go wrong with anything on the menu since this place really knows how to cook breakfast right.   Also, the staff is extremely friendly, very helpful, and patient.

To drive all the way back to a restaurant during lunch hour is such a hassle. Then, when I called the manager to let her know my muffin was missing she said \"well the cooks said they even gave you 2 muffins and threw in a free muffin.\" Lady, do you really think I would call all the way back to a restaurant to lie over a missing muffin ????? Seriously. Smh.  Then I order a kids juice for my son, and the cashier says its a large juice and it was a kids size juice for $2.70. That's way too expensive for a kids size juice which is even weird because their menu is not expensive at all !  Double check your bags before you leave !",

My go to is the Stuffed French Toast. but the pancakes are very tasty as well and dont forget the potatoes i like them cooked well done. Its about a 15 min drive from the strip but well worth it and not over priced. I have visited this location at least 5 times. i go every time i'm in Vegas. Cant wait for my next trip",

Get the banana nut muffin and look for the Groupon to save.  ___________________________________________  Such a great place for breakfast/brunch!   The winner was their banana nut muffin. It's free with check-in, but also seems to be included with almost every dish. I'd say you're a fool if you pick toast over this delicious warm muffin.   I tried out the hash with over easy eggs and potatoes. Many places serve potatoes, but these potatoes were noticeably EXCELLENT. Now I understand how potatoes should be served everywhere!  I also had a bite of my friend's loco moco and that was great as well.  Service was above and beyond. We were waiting on a friend and ordered ahead for him, and they were able to keep the food warm as we were waiting.   BONUS: There was an awesome Groupon for this restaurant, which means our meal was extra affordable (it already is a pretty sweet deal for how great it is). Seriously, check this place out!",

Low and behold, Yelp never fails us and we found this gem just a hop skip and a jump away from the airport.  Convenience at its best!   We got here around 830 and there were still parking spaces close to the entrance and lots of tables available.  We were seated promptly and were given menus to start with.  The menu is vast and full of variety.  Breakfast and lunch options.  My boyfriend settled on the biscuits and gravy along with some orange juice and I chose some hot cocoa with whipped cream and happend to stumble upon some local Hawai'i plates!  This made me feel much closer to home and I excitedly chose the loco moco medium with sunny side up eggs!  Biscuits and gravy is my boyfriend's go to meal though he probably would have chosen the loco moco instead if he saw it.    We both get our food and my first bite of the loco moco I made that sound, you know that sound you make when something is made well and brings you back to fond memories of the last time you ate it?  Yup, that was me.  It was delicious! Perfectly cooked and the gravy was tasty!  They also have those delightful banana nut muffins that were just as good.  We loved this place so much that we went back our last morning in Vegas already knowing that we were each going to get the loco moco!  Now that we found this gem of a place I'm pretty sure we'll be visiting it every time we go to Vegas now.",

Everyone was cooperative, helping one another out in the kitchen and out on the service. The manager, Ashley, does a very good job being involved and being hands on. I was observing all the action at the breakfast counter and she had hawk eyes for everything that was happening and made the service run very smoothly.   For a heads up, if you are alone or with another person I suggest going straight to the breakfast bar. You'll experience less wait time and you still receive awesome service.    I had the pleasure to have Kristopher as my waiter and the moment I sat down my order was taken.  Hats off to all the staff and their hard work especially the chef. Everything was cooked beautifully. Upon receiving my food it was presentable and the quality is consistent from the steak to the eggs (which I'm very picky about).  Thank you for a great start to my morning (:",

I actually was kind of surprised that they even had lunch items being that I only think of this place on the weekend and solely for breakfast, but their lunch was actually not too shabby.  I came with some coworkers for quick meal during a break between a seminar. I started with a glass of their fresh squeezed OJ first (gotta get that vitamin C in). It was definitely fresh & tasty, I'd recommend it! For my main meal I had the Works Tostada Salad without the meat to make it vegetarian friendly. This salad was HUGE! I think I managed to eat about 3/4 before I gave up. The flavor was very good, I liked the red & green sauce to top it off. The only negative about this mammoth was that the shell gets soggy on the bottom from all the toppings and breaks through. Meh.   Overall it was a tasty visit and I'd come here again for more lunch or breakfast goodies.",

The wait is short because food is out quick and they keep it moving! Everything is delicious!!!! The food hit the spot! I had the chili relleno stuffed omelet! That was soooo good! The banana nut muffins are incredible!!! So good, we took some home! I forgot what my Husband had but the picture is below, lol This is the place I will be bringing our out of town guests! If you are just passing through, venture off the strip and get some breakfast that will make that \"night of drinking\" disappear lol",

I have been many times, tried many things (egg sandwiches, corn beef hash, pancakes, etc) and it is all good!!!!  I also love the banana nut muffin that comes with many of the dishes. It's huge and sooo goood. Feels like an extra dessert. You can save it for later.   Give this place a try.   They have a really cute system where you flip this little sign over at your table to say whether you need service or not.  I love the decorations/characters of the entire franchise. So cute!",

I  ordered the waffle works, as I am a waffle lover and definitely enjoyed it. My friend ordered the country benny and although it was good the eggs were over cooked and the yolk didn't ooze on to her food the way she likes it, but still tasted great.

For this diner, this breakfast checked off several of my boxes: sweet (muffin), salty (spam), chewy (rice), rich (eggs), etc. It was tasty and came out quickly. Service was very attentive and my coffee cup was never empty. The staff is very nice and no matter what my group needed, everyone jumped in so we didn't have to wait for \"our\" server.",

Fun, positive energy from staff, every person handling food used gloves or tongs!!!   Kitchen staff kicked some serious butt pumping food out that all looked wonderful.  Was a good spot to sit so we could get an idea for what to order next time.    Our server Kat was awesome and very attentive to refills and our needs.    Katelyn was so funny (& hungry).

Meanwhile, since I checked in, I immediately showed our server the free banana muffin offer when she took our drink order. She happily pushed the button on my phone to claim the offer and  promptly returned with a nice warm delicious muffin. My husband got the corned beef hash and eggs. It was yummy.   I ended up ordering the garlic mashed potato omelette, which has bacon, egg, cheese, garlic mashed potatoes, green onions, and a dollop of sour cream on top.  I noticed that all of the omelettes came with their hash brown potatoes, so I asked our friendly server about it. She wittingly said, \"You can get fruit instead of the potatoes if you don't want 3 kinds of potatoes...\" So that's exactly what I did.   It was delicious! I ate very bite. Yum to the 10th power!!! The fresh fruit consisted of a watermelon triangle, a slice of honeydew, a slice of cantaloupe (hiding under the honeydew), a slice of pineapple, AND an orange wedge. Wow! Since both of our meals included a choice of bread or muffin, both of us asked if we could take our banana muffins to go.   As we were checking out at the register, my husband asked, \"Do you guys make and bottle your own hot sauce?\" She replied, \"Yes, and we have groves for the banana muffins...\" LOL!   We had a nice visit and will be sure to return next time we are in town. Thanks for the great food and awesome service, Egg Works!",

I ordered the Waffle with Fresh Fruit (strawberries) and Whipped Cream. The waffle was a little limp and soggy feeling, and not a big fluffy waffle like I was expecting. Also, some of the strawberry pieces did not look appetizing, but it was fresh so you can't do much about it.   However, this place is EGG Works so obviously their specialties are eggs. Too bad I was in the mood for something sweet. I'll definitely give this place another try if I'm out in Las Vegas again, and this time I'll try an egg dish.",

Our server Ashley came over right away. My wife ordered Brad's scrambled w/out tomatoes and I ordered two eggs scrambled hard and one Portuguese sausage link from the side orders. It arrived with in 9 minutes. The eggs were cooked perfect along with the sausage link cooked crisp.  It was a great sausage. Our server Ashley came over several times to see if all was well.

The people are always friendly, and they do get very busy, due to their reasonable prices, good location, and good (and generously sized) food.   I normally get a Hawaiian style breakfast: Portuguese sausage, eggs, and rice. Sometimes I get the avocado and bacon omelette. I also had the crepe once. They are all good, and like I said, the prices and portions are good.   So why minus one star? For me, it's not something I crave that often, and I have been to better breakfast places. I would definitely recommend them, but I can think of at least two places (off the top of my head) that do breakfast better.",

One very good sign, this place is always very very busy!

I had returned on 05/23/14 and ordered the Patty Melt.  I must say I would have instantly traded this burger for one that was well done. At best, triple-extra-well is the best way to describe it. I had noticed that the food was taking a long time to cook -- and the reason was that my burger needed an extra 15 minutes on the grill. If only there was a way to post a picture on an \"update\". Briefly described, both the bread and burger were on the grill far too long. One side of the burger patty was blackened and crunchy, like it was forgotten. Forgotten, but still served to the customer. The bread was grilled to the crunchy consistency of a cracker.  After this visit, it is safe to say I will not return.",

It's a good value for the amount of food you get but it would be better if they could sell you less food for an even cheaper price (not that it's very expensive at all).

Chile Rellenos - it was good for an American restaurant. Banana Nut Muffin - warm, buttery goodness. Free with Yelp Check in! Habla Diablo Potatoes were fantastic! I'd come back just for these.   Service: Good. If you need something, you can just flip the metal egg face to indicate that you need service.",

Today, after a long run, I wanted to eat a good hearty meal to satisfy my hunger, so naturally, we went to Egg Works. Our hostess Jamie was very friendly, attentive, bubbly, & enthusiastic. She kept checking on us and made sure we needed everything that we need to make our meal satisfying. I even claimed my free Banana nut muffin upon Yelp check-in. Even though busy, she came to our table asking for our apologies for not being able to assist us fast but the fact is, she still assisted us in a timely manner.  The food is immaculate as ever and the serving was big enough to share leaving each of us full. Everything that I've eaten from this establishment since my family and I began coming here are all good. No disappointments to date.  The only issue that I have is our receptionist, the person who welcomed us first and who sat us, Abby was not stellar. When we entered she said \"Hi\" while yawning! What the heck! She asked us if we wanted to sit on the counter and upon replying \"No\" she told us that it will be a while before we'll be sat, we said that's fine, then two seconds later, she says: \"Oh, I didn't see that table over there is open, you can be seated now.\" I wanted to tell her to have a strong mug of coffee first before resuming her duties but I decided not to. We also saw her seat other patrons and she kept yawning! If I owned this establishment, I would not want any of my staff, especially the ones who greet the patrons first to be yawning every chance they get. Geeze!  A part from our issue with Abby, our time here today is great!",

This is my \"must go\" to place, when I vacation here in Vegas.  *I also recommend this place to a friend who was visiting & she thanked me for the recommendation.   We stopped by after 11am on a Wednesday & the place filled up fast when we left.  There were many people waiting for a table. This comes to show how popular & good this place is.   I love how they have cute signs on the table & on the shirts, all egg-related.  This place is cute!!  &  for all those missing Hawaii! They have: loco moco, Portuguese sausage, spam, & Aloha Shoyu!!   I like to mentioned why Donna is so great!!  My order is a little complicated but she managed to get the request in & asked the cook if it was possible.  My order: the country ham breakfast My request: ham well done, eggs:  scrambled & over-easy starch: half rice & half potato & YES!! exactly as requested.   My other half got the omelette breakfast & he enjoyed it.  We both enjoyed our breakfast & our experience @ Egg Work.  We had an EGG-ceptional time!!   Try the potato & of course the banana nut muffin.  These are so yummy!!  I really love how the potatoes are cut up & seasoned so well.  & the muffin is so moist!!  ( check in on Yelp for a free muffin) Thanks Yelp & Egg Work for this offer!!   See you on my next Vegas Vacation Egg Works!!  I hope to have Donna as our waitress again!!",

I had a standard veggie omelette which comes with habla diabla potatoes. These are basically season salt covered diced potatoes which are a bit over powering. I must say that the banana muffin is delicious though. I wouldn't go out of my way to come here the high star ratings are over inflated for sure.",

We had originally planned to hit up a brunch buffet before we left town, but our already-indulgent weekend and not-so-empty stomachs told us not to splurge on an elaborate and expensive buffet. Instead we opted for a solid brunch place before we headed out. Found this place because my companion LOVES eggs.   DONNA was a great server - energetic and smiling on an early Sunday morning. She brought us some complimentary banana nut bread (a specialty) for our first visit. It was delicious, light, moist and fresh out of the oven. We ordered the corned beef hash and the island favorite. Food came out fast and delicious.  Would visit again!",

    "text": "Smaller, off the strip diner serving breakfast and lunch. Great decision to come here. Big breakfast menu with traditional and non-traditional choices.   The Habla Diablo potatoes are very good. I'm not much of a fried potato chunks person but these were tasty. Nicely cooked and spiced. Hubby and I chose two different Mexican breakfasts; the Mexican omelette and the Verde Scramble (I think...it's New Year's Day, trying to remember!). Both were huge, came with great fresh ingredients, those aforementioned potatoes, and toast. Really good coffee...and I LOVE that they leave you a legit full carafe of coffee. I did not run out.   This place is easy to find, has plenty of off-street parking, and gets the big job of being impressive with breakfast food done right!  All that said, I have to hand it to Egg Works management. The service was the the absolute highlight of our Egg Works visit, and the best we experienced our entire trip, including a $400 dinner the night before. Impeccable in every way. Again, my memory is not serving me at all, and I sadly can't recall his name, but our waiter was awesome and did not miss a single beat. In fact, he brought us things we didn't even know we needed; extra napkins, and free banana nut muffins that were not only very delicious, but life sustaining as we made the trek back across the desert home.   Just come here if you want to eat great food away from the chaos of The Strip joints...so to speak. We'll definitely be back next trip.",

I cannot say enough about their service and how outstanding a job they do.   We did have a moment on a busy weekend where nobody addressed giving us any service.  Even the egg flipped to the bright yellow egg (notice to the servers that the customer needs something) wasn't getting noticed.  I do believe the manager came by and did everything in his power to help us.  He went above and beyond to help us out.  I have seen him do this from time to time and I do applaud him on his ability to pitch in and make it right.  So for what few times when we had issues the staff was on the ball and made it right.   The waitresses are friendly and found one who even threw back the sarcastic humor. If there is a wait, its worth it and shouldn't take to long to be seated.  Although sitting outside with all the planes landing does get noisy. Love the pumpkin chocolate chip pancakes!",

The potatoes are coated with the Egg Works seasoning that they sell in jars.  The potatoes are crispy on the outside and soft on the inside.  The biscuit was the star of the show today.  Soft and flaky, but not dry.  The real butter is served in small individual plastic tubs that sit on the table, so they are room temp and the butter just acts like a frosting on the biscuit.  Excellent breakfast.  The staff is very friendly and they know how to serve breakfast professionally.  I can see why there are 4-5 of these places in Vegas and they are all packed with customers.",

    "text": "My friend Christy and I had an exercise class on the other side of town, so we thought we'd stop for breakfast afterward. Although I've been to the Egg & I on Sahara countless times, I had never been to Egg Works on Sunset. Same good food, same crowded environment. And, thankfully, same awesome seasoned potatoes!  Although it was not quite 11, we both opted for lunch rather than breakfast. Christy had the reuben, and I had the Carlsbad club, which was sort of like a regular club but with the addition of avocado and the subtraction of the middle piece of bread. Christy loved her sandwich (and it did look pretty good), and my sandwich was good (not great). But we each ordered a side of the aforementioned potatoes, and that IS a great thing. I'm sure the \"secret ingredient\" to these little potato chunks is just Lawry's seasoned salt (or something comparable), but that seasoning makes all the difference.  The restaurant was crowded, but we were seated quickly and our food came out fast. They have a little egg-shaped flip card on the table so if you need service, you can turn it from black to yellow and someone will come to your table ASAP. We used the flip card to ask for takeout boxes, and they were Johnny-on-the-Spot about responding. And to top it all off, I had a BYGO Entertainment book coupon, so both our meals (with two iced teas) were under $20!  Depending on which side of town you're on, you can probably find an Egg Works family restaurant somewhere near you. And I suggest you do, if not for their myriad egg dishes, for -- what else? -- their tasty taters.",

He was very friendly and nice. He took my order quickly after I sat and had my drink within seconds. I asked a few questions and he made recommendations. My food got to me super quick and I even got my check at the perfect time and was told to take my time. Let me say that I'm a pretty harsh critic, I am a waitress and I usually get annoyed easily. I have nothing bad to say about this place. I got eggs, potatoes, turkey sausage, and toast. The potatoes are so amazing! Different from other places! Seasoned just right. All my food was cooked perfect. (I hate runny eggs or if they are brown) I will never ever go anyplace else again. Goodbye to all the other places I frequent. For breakfast, this is the place to go! Thanks Robert for being an awesome server! And all of the other employees were friendly too. Somebody even remembered my name. I'm so impressed!!!",

But I'm going by my husband's reaction to it.    This is the only place where I have seen them serve whole grain pancakes and sugar free syrup.  I should have had egg whites but the whole grain pancakes were calling me so I had the banana pancakes with sugar free syrup.  I liked it a lot, but as I said I got sick and couldn't finish these.  My husband had a croissant griddle that he loved.    I've read how much people love the potatoes here, and I honestly hated them.  My husband felt the same way.  I love just traditional potatoes with salt and pepper with some fresh herbs, but these were riddled with seasoned salt or paprika or something and they were inedible for me.  However, what saves this place are those pancakes and the cheap prices here.  While we don't go out for breakfast hardly at all, when we do, we'll be going back here.",

    "text": "Who would have thought a place named Egg Works would have tasted so good. I came here because my dad kept telling me to try this place out, since we were always in the area.  Anyways, we went there about 10am and the place was packed! We had to wait for a table that seated 4adults and 1 child, which was about 25mins but that was okay, we had plenty of time to chill outside. We were finally called in and the waitress was pleasant. My bf and I, were still thinking of what to order while dad and cousin already knew what to get. We decided to just share a plate that had fresh corned beef, option of getting that or the canned version (no thanks, fresh is always better), my dad got I believe the egg combo?? I could be wrong I forgot the name. He got a half serving because they have half servings there which is a plus because I don't eat much.  As we were waiting, we seen this egg shape happy face at the end of table, my cousin explained to us that there are two faces, one sad and one happy. If you need service you would just flip the happy to the sad face and a waitress will come over. As he was showing us, I kid you not like 2secs later a waitress came by and ask if everything was okay. I was impressed but we just simply told her that we were just curious of what that was.   Our food came, it was delicious! I tried some of my dads food and it was really great. I liked mine more because my Filipino side loves corn beef canned or not ha ha. My cousins daughter had a fresh banana muffin and of course we stole a piece from her when she wasn't looking because she will not let that go, and that was really tasty. Of course being such \"tourist\" we decided to take a pic of the egg and flipped it once again and 5secs later the waitress came up and asked what was wrong. Still so amazed on how quick she came again!   The food here is great so try it out (it doesn't hurt to try right?) and the service was just as great. I like this place and would definitely come back again.",

Wandering around the outskirts of the Strip, I found Egg Works 2 just a few miles away from where I was. A minute after we sat down, our drink order was taken and then shortly after we were greeted by our especially chipper waitress, Dolly, I think her name was. I asked her for a recommendation on the menu, and I'm glad I took it. She even mentioned that they did half orders on most items on the menu.  They have a system set up to grab the staff's attention when you need something. You just flip an egg icon to reveal a yellow unhappy face. We never had to deal with that since everything was perfect. Our food came out FAST. The half order of the Chile Rellenos omelet was more than enough! It came with potatoes and a banana nut muffin. Everything was delicious. We even came back a second time during our visit to Las Vegas with my mother and brother in law! They thanked us for the recommendation.",

Yesterday i was actually hungry for lunch which doesnt happen too often and without the help of Yelp (stupid me) i just drove till something caught my eye. \"Egg Works\" sure why not everybody talks this place up so ill give it a whirl. I walked in asked the hostess if i could place a to go order, she said go back there and just kinda pointed toward the rear of the place, walking back there a tiny waitress made eye contact and i thought great somebody to help me when i asked about a to go order she ignored me and walk away, i got to the back counter where i was surrounded by 4 additional waitresses when i mentioned a to go order i again was ignored.... really? It wasnt till a few minutes later yet another waitress came by to take my order as i was lost till then... why couldnt somebody be just slightly friendly.   I asked the waitress about the salads and just had her pick her favorite, \"The Cobb\" is what she came up with and served it with balsamic which i was fine with. Even came with the famed muffin on the side which was tasty as 5hit, and even still warm. My salad was to say the least HUGE, i felt like Adam from man versus food and food lost because i have to share the salad with a co worker to finish it. Chunks of turkey, ham, bacon, egg, avocado, etc, etc it was well put together and fresh. At $10 for the salad and muffin its not too bad as it really serves two people.   Overall will i be back? En not till i figure out what else is in the surrounding area as the service just killed it for me. Thats half the meal for me.",

Generally this place is always packed from 830AM until about..... well later then I usually get there but it is well worth the wait.   They have the only home fries in town that they put just the right amount of seasoning on and are just the right texture to line the lower portion of your plate with when you order a skillet and pile it high will all sorts of artery clogging goodness.   My one tip is... get there as early as possible, especially on weekend as this place get packed.",

Facetiousness aside, I had the Sundance Special which was an omelette with mushrooms, onions, tomatoes, and artichokes folded inside with swiss cheese, then topped with tomatoes and feta cheese. It came with those ever-so-tasty, fantastically seasoned potatoes and a choice of toast or banana nut bread muffin. The muffins are homemade everyday, and taste every bit as tasty. They're sticky, moist, and not overpowering on the banana flavor.   I really can't wait to come back here, as the coffee was decent--although not the best I've had, the service was friendly, quick, and overall quite efficient, and the space is nice, light and airy. Everything that is just right about a breakfast spot. Also, it wasn't that busy for a Wednesday morning. I'd imagine this place would be packed on a weekend morning, but then again it would probably be with good reason.",

As you could imagine I was exhausted from the night before and me and my friend Sarah aka: Linda strolled in there looking crazy as shit! We had paint caked in our matted hair and we had no shame, we needed breakfast!!! Out wait was 15 minutes, which wasn't bad compaired to call the people outside the building. We finally got sat and Eden was our server. He was amazing, very sweet and despite how insane we looked, we didn't feel judged for one second! He got our drinks super fast and returned to take our order. We order the biscuits and gravy, mushroom ham skillet, and a half stack of French toast. Hahaha were out of control, but that's besides the point! Our food was great! Every single bite we enjoyed and had a really good time, the energy was flowing and I love the positivity of Eden! Great job egg works, and great job Eden! They're very lucky to have him as their employee!",

No smiles from her, just a \"go to the back bar.\" While I was waiting to cash out, there was, understandably, a line. The hostess walked over and in quite a loud voice told us to move the line to the other side of the lobby. There was no, \"excuse me, would you mind if...\" Or a \"please\" at the end of her command. The girl at the register had no smiles either. I understand it was busy and you might be at the end of your rope, but you work in the service industry. I was a hostess for two and a half years and I always had a smile on my face, even at the end of a shift, or after a difficult guest, because working at the front of a restaurant means you are the first and last impression of it. The only pleasant person I met was the older gentleman standing in front of me in line that I struck up a conversation with.",

Even with the ladder there, it seemed like everyone needed to walk down that aisle. They literally hovered over us our entire meal, with no apologies from management. I found the food mediocre at best. When we went to pay our bill at the register, a rude employee yelled to everyone to move the line in the other direction; it wasn't what she said, it's how she said it. The person at the register never asked how our time there was (ironically); if she had I planned to give her an earful. And lastly, I paid with a $50 bill; the woman at register held it up to the light to \"check it's authenticity\"; I haven't had anyone do that in years (what happened to using a bill detector pen?); very insulting.

When I took my first bite of it, I looked at my friend across the table and muttered, \"oh fuck\". I don't say those lovely words outside of the bedroom often but it was all I could say.   It was a heavenly experience.  There was 3 of us so we shared the blueberry stuffed french toast that was on special and the green chili omelet the waitress recommended. The omelet was a tad too salty. If you know me, then you know things can hardly be too salty for my taste but it just wasn't that good. The stuffed french toast however was great. The blueberries were plump and the syrup wasn't too sweet. Love the chewy consistency of the bread. Not gross like some over the top stuffed french toast but a well balance of sweetness, moistness and loveliness ( Yes, I'm still talking about food)The waitress was great since we were virgins to this place and was so very helpful.  The coffee was really good too.   The counter for paying was irritating though. The cashier is by the door so you get traffic coming in and going out.  Only 1 cashier and that can get really irritating especially when the place is busy. Overall....this is a great joint for breakfast and we will definitely be back on our trips out to Henderson/Vegas. It is worth the trip. :)",

My wife had some amazing Pancakes stuffed with fresh bananas and chocolate chips (Special Request).  They were so delicious she didn't even add syrup.   I had the classic 2 egg breakfast with smoked honey bacon that was really good.  The prices are really reasonable as well I think our whole bill was around 14.00.  Well defiantly be going back here the next time were in Vegas.",

I got the mexican omelet and he got the chili omelet, with the works chili. All I can say is: YUM. First of all, these are not normal omelets...they are massively huge! They come with breakfast potatoes smothered in old bay spice and either a muffin, toast, or bagel of your choice. The portions are seriously outrageous and the prices are decent. Not to mention, I loved the feel of this restaurant. The atmosphere is cute, the service is great and friendly, and everyone seems to be in a good mood. We will definitely be back here soon!",

I was running late to a group breakfast with my parents and another couple, I told my mom to order for me. Without looking at a menu, I just said to get a Reuben.  When I got there, my food was waiting for me, and everyone was eating besides my mom. I guess that the waitress had gotten the order wrong, and my mom was waiting for a new plate. My mom said that I would be arriving later, and my plate arrived early.  As I tried to eat my (cold) sandwich, I asked for some thousand island and water.  While we were eating, a different waitress comes and says, \"I was told to bring you a muffin.\"   Not, hello, I have a muffin for you. Or, did someone need a muffin?  She sounded unhappy to be handing out delicious muffins. How can you be grumpy when you are handing out bomb muffins?  Overall, overpriced, bland, mushy food. The fries were good though. This is also the 2nd time that orders have been wrong for my parents. Not cool.  Thanks but no thanks.",

What you get is the Blackened Prime Rib Benny. It's made up of a grilled croissant with chopped, blackened prime rib, sauteed spinach and roasted red bell peppers, two poached eggs, then covered with hollandaise sauce. And that's not including the side of home fries that they pile alongside this beast. I figured if I was going to cheat on my diet I better make it worthwhile...and it was. Simply amazing! I couldn't even finish half of it as portion size is huge.  Despite it being a busy Sunday and having a full house, they sat us down after only 15 minutes, provided swift courteous service and had our food out in no time. Menu is extensive so you there's something for everybody here.This is a great breakfast spot and seems to cater to the Vegas locals so you know it's good. Will return!",

I am really happy I found this establishment in that search. The atmosphere is very casual and comforting at the same time. Great to have a positive greeting from the hostesses upon entering the store.   Sat at the \"bar\" and proceeded to have a great meal. The menu is very extensive and pretty much has anything you could think of to start your day. I opted in for the Denver omelette. It was a great choice...how many breakfast diners give you a FOUR egg omelette? This place does and its very tasty. All of the ingredients were fresh and well worth the money. The eggs, toast, and fresh coffee were top notch. oh, and I challenge you NOT to finish all of the potatoes that come with your meal...its not possible. They are super yummy!  And perhaps the most important aspect is the server team:  Not only are they attentive but they are super friendly. I had the privilege being served by Emily and I can't say enough great things about her. She was super attentive, always checking to make sure my water was topped off , and did it all with an infectious smile and a great personality. A great combination for starting off my day right. Great positive energy is so rare these days, it was refreshing to see it still alive here. So thanks Emily!   If you're looking for a positive dining experience to start the day...Egg Works will take care of that need without a doubt. Enjoy your breakfast when you visit!. Ill be back soon!",

I usually get a spinach, mushroom and cheese scramble with breakfast potatoes.  The potatoes are seasoned and absolutely amazing.  The OJ is a little expensive, but it's usually expensive everywhere so I guess that's typical.  The better value is to split a carafe. The only complaint I have is that I wish it was open later that 3pm.  Another thing I like about this place is the little flip over eggs, to let your server know you need help.

This place is one of the most well run places I've seen when it gets really busy. Customers are consistently piling in and the servers are multitasking and helping each other.  Perry helped me out and was quick to get my order and asked during my stay if I needed anything. Keep in mind, I was here for more than a few hours.  The country fried steak was well portioned, with the spicy potatoes, and scrambled eggs.  I'm glad I stopped in and encourage any other traveler, local, or wanderer to give them a look.  I think they're a big deal, but what do I know, I'm from Michigan.",

I ordered an omelet and my husband ordered a crepe. It came with their Diablo Potatoes and I have to say that it is the most delicious breakfast potatoes I have ever had! They were crispy and perfectly seasoned and I would come back just to get an order of them! The omelet was pretty good and my husband enjoyed his crepe.  What's neat about this place is that the menu is a newspaper so it gives you the whole breakfast experience! Also, the tables have a little flipcard stand where you can flip the card over when you want your server to assist you- this is super efficient because the restaurant is super busy!  I highly recommend and will be back next time we are in Vegas!",

UPDATE 05.02.2015 came in on Saturday for brunch. Despite how busy the place was, we were seated within 10 min! Chelsea was our waitress and she was excellent and a had a delightful personality. I've been to Egg Works more than a dozen times and Chelsea is the first one to ever mention using the happy egg/sad egg signs on the table to signal you need assistance. So I thought that was neat that she mentioned it. I ordered the stuffed French toast. It was delicious. One thing I love about Egg Works is that they provide a ton of flavored creamer. Rarely do I see restaurants offering flavored creamer.",

    "text": "This place is Eggcellent!   After reading my Yelp buddy Judy C.'s review of Egg Works........I quickly booked marked this place to give it a go when I was out here in Las Vegas.  Apparently Egg Works has 5 locations - 4 restaurants are in the Las Vegas area, and 1 restaurant is in the Henderson area.  This location on E. Sunset Road was not too far from our hotel...........I wanna say it was about an 8 mile drive to this place.   When we got here in the late morning (10:30 AM or so) the restaurant was packed! We had a short 5 minute wait before be got seated outside. (They have indoor & outdoor seating). May I recommend if you're from Hawaii and not use to the winter cold.........you should sit inside, because when the wind is blowing, and you're not moving around.............it can get pretty nippy outside. Lol!  Upon scanning the menu, I decided to get the \"Sundance Special\", which is basically a Veggie Omelet which consisted of the following - Spinach, Sliced Mushrooms, and Artichoke Hearts folded with Swiss Cheese, with a special works artichoke cheese filling, topped with Feta Cheese, and fresh Tomatoes. I also added some blacken chicken with my veggie omelet, and with my meal, there was this square cut potatoes that came on the side.........  One of my friends had ordered the Country Fried Steak, and my other friend ordered a Spinach Benny.  With my breakfast, I got a Banana muffin, and I must say it was soft & warm. It went great with my pot of coffee!  Overall I loved my Sundance Special........the veggie omelet was awesome! What I didn't care for was the square cut potatoes, because the potatoes were rather salty & dry. I ate very little of that, and had to stop because it was just too salty for me.  The menu you here is pretty extensive.........and they are basically opened for breakfast & lunch. as the hours here go from 6 AM to 3 PM.",

We were determined this time to not be hurried through our meal by the wait staff.  We were seated at a two-top in the back next to the counter seating. We ordered quickly, and received our food quickly as well. We ordered the Bandito Scramble. This included chorizo, jalapenos, cilantro, cheddar, diced green chilies and a side of 'habla diablo original salsa', topped with sour cream. This also came with seasoned potatoes and we chose the banana muffin over the toast.  The scramble was pretty tasty. It was not spicy at all, and the combination of the salsa and sour cream made it even better. The salsa was nothing special. It was more like a picante sauce, very mild and not chunky. The seasoned potatoes were alright, but seasoned way too heavily. They were red from all of the seasoning. My guess is that it was Lawry's seasoned salt.  I would have preferred a lot less of this on the potatoes.   On a Sunday, our wait was about 20 minutes. Service was quick, and friendly. Not too bad.",

Egg works is in a really convenient location if you're flying in and the cost is significantly less than what you'd pay on or near the strip.   It's got a typical diner feel. Newspaper style menus with about 50+ items to choose from in all. I got a skillet with bacon, sausage, eggs, potatoes, and cheese for days. The portions are huge and you will NOT go home hungry. My wife ordered some sort of open faced croissant sandwich that came with potatoes on the side. It was sooooo good.   Honestly, the biggest surprise of the whole meal was the banana nut muffin that we got. When you think of a banana nut muffin, it doesn't exactly stir up the same excitement that you'd get for other breakfast food, but let me tell you...these muffins are to die for! They come out warm, so cut it in half and slather that baby in butter and you are in for a treat!   The service was very good despite the restaurant being super packed. We were always getting refills quickly and our food came out right on time. They're really a well-run operation which is just as important to me as the food itself.   Overall, a fantastic experience that is probably more of a hideout for locals than it is for tourists, but it was wonderful. We'll be back next time we're in town.",

    "text": "... Its ok food. I  been here twice. Once I got the chili,  and the other time i got the Spinach benny The benny was actually wonderful! Perfect combo of raw spinach and yummy sauce!  I do recall my mom getting a breakfast burrito and it was hideous. It had gravy and all kinds of shit in it. Just nothing acidic to balance it. It was eggs and gravy and meat. No salsa or tomato. She kindly asked the waitress to change her order, it was  yucky. She did, and everything worked out...   We asked for a coffee cup and the girl put the cup rim down on the dirty table. I understand that is how you set up a table, but usually when the rim is down there is a napkin or paper doily under it. She just didnt get it.   Good thing: they put a sign on your table that lets the staff know if you need anything. Thats a good idea!  Prices are good! Location is great. Not sure what I keep missing about this place that others are raving about? Maybe I am not ordering the right stuff???. Sorry. If that changes I will def update this.",

    "text": "Who would have figured that this place would have been so good in a small nondescript strip mall?? You gotta come tot his place...  a. Location - Not bad, but kind of hidden away at the Park 2000 Strip Mall on the Northeast corner of Sunset and Eastern. Not quite visible from the street, but there are some signs.  Plenty of parking.  b.  Ambiance - I was pleasantly surprised by the feeling of the restaurant. I was thinking that it would be small and budget like.  It was rather large, well lit, and the feeling was just right. A bit homey, plenty of room and a feeling like, this is comfy!  c.  The menu - OK, I am generally not too confused and know what I like. However, this place has an amazing menu.  It is like a local newspaper with several pages.  From these amazing egg/bacon/ carb combos, to hawaiian breakfast, to omelets, salads, hamburgers, chili the cincy way.... everything sounded so good.  I opted for an omelette with sourdough toast, and I am saving myself for the hawaiian breakfast and for the chili over spaghetti.  That sounds so cool... You cannot go wrong at this place, the choices are quite amazing.  d.  The service - I would say, this is more than great. They check on you all the time, they are professional, very courteous and very friendly.  I think they have servers that believe in their company, in their product and proud.  It is such a great feeling.    e.  The food - I described the menu, and the food is just as great.  Everything here works well. It just clicks. I have already come back since this lunch on Saturday to try out the meals on Sunday morning which is a busier time at their other location. Guess what, it was only a 15 minute wait.  Denny's Ihop,  WHO?  Never again.  GK says, for a great experience, try the Egg Works.",

The waitress was very nice, I believe her name was Diana. As for the food, I had the Sundance Omelette. The omelette was tasty and had a good portion of ingredients including spinach, tomato, artichokes and feta cheese. My only qualm with the omelette was that the egg was cooked well and came out hard on the outside vs soft and fluffy. The coffee was of average quality. I like that they leave the coffee pot at the table for you for instant refills. I substituted the potatoes for fresh fruit on the plate and I got a nice assortment of melons (3 kinds), pineapple, and grapefruit. Good little place for breakfast. The free banana nut muffin with Yelp check-in was a nice bonus!",

I had the bacon avocado omelette. It was delicious from the first bite to the lady bite. Overflowing in ripe avocado and the best combo of bacon. My son had the cheese burger and before I could attempt for a taste he was done with it. Ashley of waitress was great. And the banana nut muffins are too die for. First time and definer not our last here. Vegas and us and this place is a definite.  if you like great food you should make it a point to visit this place",

In the years that I've been frequenting the establishments, I haven't had bad service. This recent experience, going around noon, was no different. The funny thing about going in that time frame is that their busiest period had passed. Hahaha... According to the boyfriend, there was like 2 servers to 1 table, constantly checking on their patrons, and still able to have a good time with co-workers.  Anyway, I like their skillets, particularly their Chicken Fried Steak. The boyfriend likes their Patty Melts. I think their fries and red potatoes (breakfast plates) are seasoned the same way. It's just yummy. Hahaha... I like the way they leave the coffee pot with the table so I can just help myself unless that runs out. I think the only thing I didn't like about this experience was paying for the bill... The ladies didn't acknowledge me when I walked up to the desk. They just talked about fixing another table's bill, even though they all made eye contact with me at some point. Then when they were done, the cashier just held her hand out for my bill. Eh.",

I was hungry so it was fine. Though I usually rather get a table, take my time and get great service here. The menu selection is amazing! I love, love the fact that they have a vegetarian eggs Benedict. I get everything I could possibly want! Tomatoes, spinach, avocado with poached egg and a perfect sauce- not too sour, good consistency, not drenched. Couldn't resist and I wanted the best of both worlds so convinced my friend to split the stuffed strawberry cream cheese French toast. I've been dreaming about stuffed French toast since first having it in Hawaii. This hit the spot and made my Vegas experience! Have to pay at the register in front where they have a selection of sauces and seasonings to take home. There was quite a line up. Wish I could just pay at the table and go. My experience this time was more a 4 star with the service, counter seating experience, and line up but I still gave 5 based on past experiences and the food.",

Even slightly crunchy...and not because they were fried to a crisp. It was SALT.   Gravy? Lukewarm, but that's okay, I couldn't eat it due to the salt level.   Bacon? Appropriately salty.   I should've taken the leftovers to my horse. I'd never have to buy a salt lick again.",

I wasn't feeling eggs so much, so I went with a crepe.  It wasn't your typical thin pancake crepe, its more like a very thin omelet.  Still, it was tasty.  I wanted all the sauce on the side and turkey sausage instead of bacon.  I got turkey bacon instead, but that was fine because my spouse said the turkey sausage was spicy and I don't do spicy.  I also wanted my banana muffin ( unwarmed) and to go, but it was warmed and presented to me on a plate.  No biggie, I just packed it in a box to go.    My spouse had the blueberry pancakes with eggs and turkey sausage.  I did think that was slighty pricey at 11.55, however, I did have a groupon( 12 for 20) so it was still a decent value for breakfast.",

Sweet and savory is definitely my thing and I'm glad someone turned it into reality. My only complaint is the upcharge for substituting the potatoes with sliced avocado, since on the menu the latter was slightly cheaper. But oh well, I did create extra work for the kitchen, and it's a diner. So I'm being a bit nitpicking.   My friend's cincinnati chili spaghetti looks...very interesting. But I've never seen pretty cincinnati chili in my entire life either.   My favorite part about the set up of this place is that they give you a whole container of coffee that you can fill up your cup by yourself, so you aren't just sitting there waiting for a waitstaff to come by and refill your cup.

Depending on the time which we try to make it early, there is never a wait, the coffee is good and the as I said above the food is amazing.  I will have to look at the receipt again for the server we had, she is tall with blonde hair and she is one of the friendliest people I have ever met there.  She is always cheerful and really cares about her customers.    Those who go in there often enough she will get to know you and will treat you like a family friend.  I highly recommend this place even though they no longer show appreciation to veterans.",

We enjoyed our meals and were ready for the rest of the day.  The manager noticed that I didn't receive my food in the same time as my group and offered me a to go serving of their famous banana nut muffin. So yummy!   I enjoyed a banana waffle with whipped cream, eggs over easy and bacon... again so yummy!   My brother enjoyed his country fried steak and so did my friends.  I'll definitely be back again when in Vegas.  The place was clean and the crew were very polite.  See you guys soon!   Thanks for the excellent service.",

The breakfast portion of the menu spans 4 pages, with myriad choices, whether eggy items like benedicts, omelets, scrambles, skillets, crepes; or other breakfast fare like burritos, pancakes, waffles, French toast, hash, biscuits & gravy, or country fried steak. So much calorific goodness to choose from that I had to come twice! The biscuits & gravy was perfect comfort food for a winter morning, while the omelets were quite hefty and came with potatoes and a choice of toast or a warm, housemade banana nut muffin (yes, please do choose the latter).  There are also more substantive non-breakfast dishes here like burgers, sandwiches, and salads. Service is super fast and efficient here, and there are plenty of seats, whether at the counter or at many tables throughout the fairly large venue. Simply lots of good stuff served fast.",

    "text": "Stopped by Egg Works before heading back to LA after reading about it in a little magazine that was in the taxi. We decided to make the trek out because of the free breakfast entree coupon. The yelp reviews looked great, so we decided to head to Egg Works instead of a typical Sunday brunch on the strip. Whenever we woke up that Sunday morning, we packed and stumbled to the car to get some breakfast. After about a 20 minute drive from the strip, we finally arrived at Egg works.   The place is relatively big, so the wait for 3 wasn't about 15 minutes. After being seated, we were promptly served drinks and then was left to look over the extensive menu. I decided on a side order of the corned beef hash and the Green Chili omelet. The omelet was extremely large. It probably had 3 whole Ortega chilies, a ton of cheese, and another ton of cheese on top. The omelet was good, but nothing special. Along with the omelet came a side of home potatoes that seemed like it was tossed with a whole bottle of Lawry's season salt. If you like that stuff, then you'll love these potatoes. If not, I'd see if they can cut the season salt next time. The corned beef and hash was interesting. It was more like corned beef and mashed potato pancake that was crisped on the flat top.   Overall, if you have time to venture beyond the strip, check Egg Works out. You won't be hungry after the meal.",

They do not serve sushi and crab legs like the buffets, but the food is delicious, fresh and always hot.  My favorite thing on the menu is their pork carnitas crepe. Breakfast is served with a fresh, yummy banana muffin. They make one of the best BLT sandwiches. They serve fabulous bloody Mary's. And to go they sell delicious carrot cake.  There are five or six locations throughput the city and Henderson. I have eaten at three of them, each which had stellar service. The servers were hard  working and seemed happy with their jobs.",

So when we got there we were seated pretty quickly. Our friendly waitress took our drink order, then gave us a few minutes to decide what we wanted to eat. As soon as we were ready, she took our order : I ordered a chorizo breakfast burrito (no bell pepper or onions), which came with hablo diablo potatoes. My boyfriend got a bacon ham and egg skillet which also came with hablo diablo potatoes.  Then we waited...and waited...and waited. Finally the food arrived, and mine was correct, but they accidentally gave my boyfriend's order to another table and gave him the wrong item. The waitress noticed the moment she put it down on the table, because there wasn't supposed to be mushrooms in his. We thought that it was going to take a really long time to redo his skillet, but it took less than five minutes to bring out a new one.  The burrito tasted amazing, and tasted even better with hablo diablo sauce on it. The potatoes were deliciously seasoned with hablo diablo dry seasoning, which tasted like obey seasoning.  My boyfriend really enjoyed his skillet as well. I tried it and it tasted delicious with the Hablo diablo sauce.  I would definitely come back here despite how long the food took. I just need to make sure it's not when I'm absolutely starving aka hangry :)  P.S. they have a check in deal for a free banana nut muffin",

Anyway, I'm not a breakfast person at all, but my husband & kids are, so based on the excellent reviews we decided to try Eggworks. Man oh man, was that the best decision we ever made for breakfast!   The place was super packed & even so, the service was still excellent...that says a lot. From the greeter at the front door, to our waitress, & the gentleman that we paid our tab with we experienced nothing but smiles, friendly service, & nice conversation.  Now, the food...AMAZING! It's been so long so I don't remember the name of the omelet I ordered, but it was delicious & a HUGE portion. I'm a girl that loves to eat & can eat large portions, but even this I couldn't finish. Also, I'm picky about my breakfast potatoes & most restaurants just can't get them right, but Eggworks makes some damn good potatoes! My husband loved his bacon cheeseburger & fries too & cleaned his plate. Their food is so fresh & clearly their chefs/cooks know how to perfect flavor & texture. My kids also loved their plates & not only because they were delicious, but because they were fun to look at (pancakes/French toast with faces on them). If only my hometown or a neighboring town had an Eggworks...they just might have made me into a breakfast person.",

I ordered the Mexican crepe and it was so good I ate every last bite. It came with a side of potatoes and those were good too--but the main egg dish is what this place is all about. I tried bites of 2 other dishes and they were equally scrumptious. They have free WiFi here and the network/password is prominently posted.

I ordered the Chile relleno omelette which had a whole Chile stuffed with cheese, topped off with chopped cilantro and a big dollop of sour cream. You get a choice between toast or their banana muffins. I opted for sourdough toast. It also comes with their crispy habla Diablo seasoned potatoes- similar to using Lawry's salt by more of a paprika kick.   My husband got their blackened prime rib Benny- a skillet of prime ribs pieces layered amongst eggs and tons gooey cheese. It comes with their signature potatoes.   Yelp check in offers a free banana nut muffin. Our waitress was nice enough to bring my husband and I each a muffin. The muffin was sooooo good- dense, moist and absolutely melt in your mouth.   This place is busy but the staff handled it with friendliness and patience.   I'll definitely come back whenever I'm in the area.",

    "text": "Nothing special. The place is located in a sketchy-looking strip mall. The place itself is so cheesy inside. They tried to go for a country feel and failed. Everything about the food was overkill. I ordered a veggie scramble and to my surprise it came covered in cheese. To the point that it felt like I was just eating melted cheese and not the veggie scrambled I ordered. The potatoes looked great but they were SO overly seasoned I couldn't eat them. The best part of the entire meal was the banana nut muffin, which I wouldn't even think is that great on its own, but given the rest of the meal, it was the best part. Skip this place and find somewhere else to get breakfast.",

We sat for a while purposely before ordering so we could take a look at other people's plates. To our amazement, everyone's plates were filled the brim. Our wonderful server, Ethan explained they don't do senior portions however they do 1/2 orders.  As the picture will show, it was more than enough. The coffee was brewed to perfection and the muffins were so good we had to take some home. Every egg dish we ordered was delicious. Special thanks to Ethan for providing us great service.",

But we were the odd man out and ordered French toast and pancakes LOL. I ordered the corned beef hash with eggs over easy and didn't realize until I ordered it that the corned beef was from a can. Womp womp. My brother ordered their maple bacon French toast, which was just maple bacon cream with some regular French toast LOL. My friend ordered the pumpkin blueberry pancakes, and they were okay. This place does breakfast really well without anything fancy, but it wasn't over the top great.   5 stars for great service, and three stars for the food. So I'm going to average that and make it three stars.",

I love the black smiley egg sign at our table which means everything's good and flipping it to the yellow frowny face means we need assistance.  We just needed a new bottle of ketchup and our friendly server was on it. The service is so good here.  I ordered Country Eggs Bennie medium and wow, it was perfection. I requested the country gravy on the side and our server remembered to have the cook prep it that way.  Also, this menu offers an island style cuisine which is brilliant as Hubs ordered what else? Portuguese Sausage with eggs over easy. Their signature banana nut muffin is amazing. Not too sweet or oily but moist and airy.  Also at our table were tablets where we had a choice of paying at our table or at the front.  There was a slight error as we had inadvertently pushed the gaming button. No prob, they took that off the bill. The decor is traditional, family friendly, country theme and very cute. (Outhouse sign for the restroom area! Lol.)  We were lucky to come in at a good time as it wasn't crowded at all and we found parking easily. We'll definitely be back to this or any of the Eggworks locations.",

She brought us a loaf of banana nut bread on the house and took the charge off of the bill. She also gave us some discount tickets for the next time we came in. It was above and beyond.

We might have to start coming to sunset over eastern because Donna was so great.   We had different omelettes today and both were delicious.

The best part of the meal was the service. Hector was super. He was warm and friendly, fast to bring us drinks and get our orders. He gave great advice and followed up well. We felt like we were well attended without being nagged which is a hard thing to do and we really appreciated his great service. Definitely recommend for a solid, yummy breakfast with good service.",

You really get a home feel with the great food and the beyond excellent service. Las Vegas has a reputation of rude people, but Egg Works has done a great job finding hospitable waiters.  I got the Skillet Breakfast with chicken, mushroom, and spinach with toast. The portion was large and packed with ingredients to get an excellent taste. Also, if you check in you get a muffin for free. I waited for the toast but my waitress was running all over the place. It is urged to flip the egg to a sad face if you are not happy or need something. I flipped it for 1 second and the quickly the concerned waitress came over to see why I wad not happy. She quickly resolved the issue and was so nice about it. Jaime had a great attitude and I wish all waiters/waitresses were this helpful. I would definitely recommend this place if you are in the neighborhood and looking for some family friendly breakfast.",

This place is exceptional!  I had Brads Omelette.  I did substitute bacon for mushrooms.  So I was boring right, no Benny, no stuffed toast, yet I felt it was one of the best omelettes I have EVER had.  Brad must be a big deal and the menu is huge so Brad, consider a \"Brad's with bacon\" it was out of this world.  We shared a warm, fresh, banana nut muffin that was on the house from the relationship with Yelp.  It was incredible too!   Most important though.  The service.  The young people who greet you are exceptional.  Our server Chris awesome.  From the minute you walk in and they greet you at the foot snd seat you, to being seated, to being served it feels like family.  And is a great marketing engine for the good people of Las Vegas!  Great job guys!   This is not a fancy place. It is practical.  If I didn't know you t was a chain I would have sworn it was a stand alone family restaurant which it must be yet they have preserved that personal touch as they have expanded.  I am from out of tow, great personal Vegas experience.  Wonderful way to start your day off strip or before catching a flight out early off strip.  Don't miss it!",

Us girls were being obnoxious drunk bitches at 11am when we stepped into the restaurant, yet our lovely server treated us with much friendliness, even sitting herself at our table as we chit-chatted our way into placing our orders.   With her recommendation, I tried the corned beef hash with two eggs over easy. According to my memory under the influence, that corned beef hash was the best that I have ever had. With ample home-cured corned beef and perfectly cooked taters and eggs, I soon was under the spell of food coma. So, friends, come with an empty stomach, and prepare for a satisfying and reasonably priced breakfast in Vegas.",

Why wait 15 minutes when you can get virtually the same thing if not better at other breakfast places? On top of that, my waitress was very slow to serve us.   My friend, girlfriend, and I had already chosen what we desired yet, we waited an additional 10-15 minutes. It was busy but there's no excuse for waiting that long. I got the corned beef hash which was not that well cooked and the hash was shredded way too excessively. It was almost as if I'm tasting carnitas. On top of that was scrambled eggs, which there is nothing bad you can say about standard scrambled eggs. The potatoes were actually quite good. They had some kind of salt and spice that was addicting. But there's a problem when the side tastes better than the main dish.   Overall, mediocre food, below average service. Would not consider this an option for breakfast brunch. I would rather starve and wait for lunch if I had to.",

But, being a Tuesday mid morning we were seated right away and it had a decent flow of customers.  Maya (our wonderful server) came and greeted us right away. One of the things that stood out to me the most about our entire experience is that everyone working there seemed genuinely happy to be at work. Everyone was bubbly and all smiles and it definitely made for a great dining experience!  The hubby ordered the Chile Relleno Omelet and I had what I would describe as being their personal take on Biscuits and Gravy.  Everything was delicious! We especially loved their potatoes, they had a wonderful seasoning with a light kick!  Another major bonus is when you check in on yelp you get a free Banana Nut Muffin! So moist and tasty!!",

He is too cool for the face and wants some meat.  He has ordered lunch or off the adult menu to avoid the mouse pancake.  I tried to talk him into asking the waitress to not make it a mouse and we could add a side of bacon.  Instead our server talked him into an adult meal that he had for breakfast the next day too and I threw away the eggs.  I won't be back with the kids.

    "text": "I love breakfast!  It was my first time here and EW2 didn't disappoint. Even the 20min wait was worth it. Great, friendly service even during a packed house at noon on a Sunday. Accommodating our large group was not a big deal.   Reading over the newspaper like menu, there were so many items to choose from even three hawaiian dishes! I went with The Works Skillet, even though the stuffed french sounded amazing. The works skillet is packed with flavor and textures. I really enjoyed the banana nut muffin as well. My sis got the Haole Moco and that looked very good as well. The other orders in our party all looked great. (drool)  Being in Vegas, I had to keep the vibe going, so i got the Greyhound (vodka and grapefruit) and it was darn good.   Also, we had two birthday celebrants in our party and our server brought out decorated banana nut muffins with a candle. We all sang \"happy birthday\". That was fun!  EW2 you're now on my list of favs in Vegas! Being off the strip, it's a nice little drive away from the touristy atmosphere.  Also read, Joanne C's review. :D",

The server seemed to have a very lackadaisical attitude about being at work and did not try to please our table. Along with this, the manager on duty apparently wasn't capable of buttoning up her shirt or moving around very much considering she stayed in about the same 5ft of space my entire visit. Just didn't look or act very professional. I will keep my business that the other Henderson Egg Works location considering I have a much better experience.",

It could have been better considering that they have eggs on the table to show your server whether you need service or not.  I thought it was genius at first but then began to think of how impersonal it is.  I enjoy servers coming up to me randomly asking how everything is and my water magically re-appearing.  That's when you know your service is good.  The fact that they rely on the clients to passively flip a sign is kind of a turn-off.  Come and talk to me... I won't bite.",

I ordered a Hawaiian breakfast.  I had rice, Spam, eggs, and fresh fruit.  It was great.  I love Spam and the egg yolk mixed into the rice was a delicious combination.  I have not been back since that time because it is not on my side of town.  If I do make it back though, and I hope that time comes, I want to try the biscuits and gravy.  I saw somebody order that and it looked awesome.  The plate, more of a platter, was huge.  The biscuits, though thoroughly covered in gravy, looked to be big and fluffy.  Even from a distance I could see the sausage in the gravy.  I must try this.  The food I got was great.  The food I saw looked amazing.  Service was a tad slow but it was a busy Saturday morning.  Wait staff can only go so fast when the restaurant is near capacity.  That is another sign that Egg Works is nothing short of grand.",

It took us a while to sort through what we wanted to try, but we ended up with the fiesta skillet (with salsa and chili), the country fried steak skillet, and a cup of chili. The main orders also came with a banana nut muffin that the BF really liked. His country fried steak was much better than mine, and I think that was partly because the salsa didn't taste fresh (I envisioned something along the lines of pico de gallo, I don't know why) while his gravy was sooo good. So that would be my recommendation. The chili was fantastic too. We ended up taking half of each skillet, plus almost 3/4 of the chili home. And I swear we were hungry to begin with!  I think this is a great option if you are looking for more local food in Las Vegas that's off the Strip. Oh, we also found a buy one entree get one free coupon from a coupon book (the ones that you get anywhere on the Strip) that we forgot to use. Ugh.",

They didn't take reservations on Sunday, but they were very accommodating for 8:00 am and a party of 31.  The service was awesome, our server, she was so personable and on top of things, a real PRO!  Their egg dishes are humongous, 4 eggs!!  And a lot of delicious sides.  The chocolate chip pancakes were a hit as was the waffles and all. Of their egg dishes, their scrambles and egg combos are delish. Sis had the egg crepes, too yummy and big. Such a diverse and large menu, you will be sure to find something!  The seasoned potatoes were awesome.  Great restaurant, great service and awesome wait staff!",

    "text": "Wow, I feel bad for everyone who wrote glowing reviews.  They obviously have been subjected to really awful food all of their life.  I got the chicken fried steak with over medium eggs and one of the muffins everyone raved about.  Everything came with enough salt to preserve my digestive organs for the afterlife.  The potatoes are cheap, frozen cubes soaked in season salt...inedible.  the gravy was also way overseasoned, might of had some potential if not for that.  The banana nut muffin was nothing to write home about and had a weird texture.  The husband got the avocado bacon omelette.  Though he is a hearty eater, two thirds of his food was left behind.  The omelette had a ton of cheese melted over top, usually a good thing, not in this case.  The cheese looked plastic like and he said it tasted microwaved.  He too had a large portion of blood pressure killing potatoes.  The kid had chocolate chip pancakes.  Nothing to write home about but apparently way better than what we got.  $41 for this lousy meal.  When we paid, the lady asked how everything was and my husband replied very salty and terribly overseasoned.  She responded by giggling like a school girl and telling him the total.  Way to handle a complaint there.  A $2 egg mcmuffin beats this junk any day.",

I had fruit on the side in place of the home fries and it was a decent sized portion.  My husband liked omelette house more so we'd probably not go back.

He checked on us frequently and was very courteous.  I had the special for the day, the firecracker scramble.  It was cheesy, spicy, saucy, and huge!  Everything I wanted.  I actually fed the last of it to my fiance -- I was defeated.    The banana nut muffin is ridiculous.  I don't know what to make of this thing.  The muffin top isn't your run-of-the-mill rounded little top, but a flying saucer of sorts just perched right up there like nobody's business.  I'm upset we didn't get a dozen to take back with us.

So many people waiting to be seated but since I was a one person, I was able get a seat at the counter.  I was able get the corner counter and be service pretty quickly. OMG bad idea to come on 11:45 am to lunch time and real busy and so many people waiting. After 5 mins, she took my order of coffee with my French Vanilla creamer, Waffle with 2 scramble eggs and ham. I waited about 20 mins for my meal to be served. They were so back up in the kitchen and about 12:20 pm the ticket service shut down and no tickets to be enter for about 15 mins. But I was lucky I got my bill prior to the shut down.   So my bill was $14.29 all together without the muffin ( add $1.95 for the muffin to the bill).    Over all I'm very happy and my stomach is totally Satisfied.  If the counter is able on very busy day, up to 4 people together nicely.  If not, you'll need to waiting Patiently!!

    "text": "I LOVE this place and ever since I found it years ago, I always make sure to make a stop when I am in Vegas. I rave about this place and always tell people to come here because it is genuinely one of the best breakfast joints around, and considering I travel a lot it's saying a lot. You may be asking then why I am giving it a 3 and that's because they (today) they changed the way/recipe of their skillets and I was not made aware so I ordered it and to my surprise it was literally like eating a whole bottle of salt. I don't eat salt and the flavor literally made me spit my food out. I don't complain about food EVER but it was so bad that I needed to say something. The manager came over and informed me of the change to the way the prepare it that took place the day I came in (my luck) and offered to make me a new one. By the time the new one came my stomach was so upset that I couldn't even eat it. The waitress did everything she could to help and was apologetic as was the manager but still didn't resolve the issue. I hope EggWorks goes back to their old way because this place truly is amazing but I don't want to pay to eat salt.",

THE POTATOES YOU GUYS!!!! ...the potato seasoning is so good (they also sell it at the cashier so pick one up on the way out and put it on everything you cook at home). Everything I've tried on the menu has been delicious - eggs benny, omelettes, skillets! Service is always fast and friendly. Try the Bloody Mary!",

    "text": "I have waited until I've had three bad experiences at this location, and yesterday was it. We went on Sunday for my partner's birthday, and waited 30 mins for a table outside, although there was only one other couple on the outdoor patio at the time (8 tables outside).   When we were seated, another 10 mins before a waitress asked for our drink order. That took another 20 minutes for coffee to arrive (without cream/sugar).   When we ordered our drinks, we shared our fabulous YELP checkin bonus of a free muffin. When the coffee and orange juices came out, there was no muffin. We reminded the waitress of the muffins, and she came back with one of the two muffins, and no butter, about 13 mins after we reminded her (yes, we'd started a clock at this point).  We reminded her we had two checkin muffins, so she went for the other muffin.  17 minutes after that (now we're 1 hour, 17 minutes into our visit), she brings out the other muffin and wants to take our order.  We explained we just wanted the bill, and we'd go to a different Eggworks.  We waited 7 minutes for the bill to arrive and then deposited $5 on the table and left. The manager followed us out to the parking lot and offered us a coupon for \"Buy one, get half-off the second meal.\"   This particular location has been nose-diving since November of 2017; I doubt we'll ever return. This location went through a period last fall where the potatos were drowning in heavy spice and other condiments, to the explanation of \"Our owner likes it spicy, so he insists we deliver it that way.\" odd that other locations weren't like that. The location on Eastern is much, much better, the staff is better, parking is harder, but we've never had ridiculous waits, never had bad service, and always very much enjoyed the experience there. 30 mins further from our home, but well worth the extra drive on a Sunday morning where relaxation is the goal.",

I also had the strawberry stuffed French toast. Everything was excellent. The staff moved quick and seemed like they had been doing this for awhile. Everything and everyone worked fast and efficiently. I sat at the counter in the back and the young waiter was great. He made sure we had everything we needed. I can't remember his name... but he was great! Oh... and the banana muffin we got while we waited for our food was excellent! Next time I'm in Vegas it will be a must stop!",

    "text": "I was excited to check this place out after seeing images of their breakfast potatoes on yelp. They looked so crunchy, savory, and delicious! We drove about 9 miles off the strip to eat here and unfortunately the experience was just okay.   The environment is very homey...and old timey with a farm mural all over the walls and a \"general store\" by the entrance. Their eggs were cooked really well I'll give them that! I ordered a skillet and I really wish I hadn't. My skillet cane with potatoes, chilies, a hugeeeeee amount of cheese, and the over medium eggs on top. Sounds good right? Might have been good if it wasn't totally and completely smothered in their house salsa of which I wasn't a fan. This made the potatoes have no crunch, the cheese was overkill, the salsa was subpar and not spicy at all, and I basically only enjoyed the eggs.  Service was fine. We were able to order quickly and were checked up on. When we went to the register to pay we were ignored for a couple minutes while the two working at the register were chatting nonstop.   I definitely would consider coming here again because maybe I just didn't get the right thing. This place definitely seems to be doing something right to draw such a crowd.",

This place is AMAZING! When we arrived we were greeted by the hostess and was seated right away. The server came within 3 minutes and took our drink orders. My sister ordered their mimosa and I had regular coffee to start. After drinks the super nice server took our meal order and once it arrived OMG I fell in love with this place. I wish they had a Egg Work in Maryland!   Overall, our experience was positive here. We came back again on March 14th before we left Vegas to head back to Washington DC and the food was very consistent. Will definitely be back on my next trip to Vegas very soon.",

I usually get over medium eggs for loco moco so the yellow egg yolk can be runny with all the gravy, rice, and meat combined! The rice was sticky and perfectly cooked, the egg is exactly how i wanted, and the meat i got was well done and so flavorful! I couldn't imagine having this amazing loco moco and beating my all time fave place to get loco moco (L&L).   The service was super fast & caring. The server was really attentive and the food came out fast as well! There wasn't a wait time despite it being packed! I love how there's a variety of american breakfast dishes as well as hawaiian! There's so many different dishes options. The portion plates are huge as well! Their menus are adorable newspaper style, with a lot of cute decorations around the restaurant. I love eating breakfast here!",

I had to add my own salt/pepper as it wasn't as seasoned as I prefer, but the quality and value were spot on.  It will run you $11.99.

I prefer the cubed pieces of corned beef and potatoes that are then crisped on multiple sides.  The eggs were cooked well and the portions were large for the price.  What i liked most was the seasoned potatoes, i think most of the breakfast dishes come with them too.  They are crispy and taste like they are dusted with creole seasoning i wish they just threw in some cubed corned beef with these potatoes, that would be an awesome corned beef hash!  Also the Banana bread muffin is terrific and worth ordering instead of your bread choice.  Service is friendly and efficient, they leave a pot of coffee on your table so you can refill yourself as needed.  I thought that was a terrific idea, since it frees them up to service other people rather than going around and constantly refilling everyones coffee.  Theres also an iPad thing on the table so that you can pay for your meal at the table, also another way to free up the servers so they can service more people.  Someone else in our party also got the Gumbolaya a combination of Gumbo and Jambalaya, it was ok, but nothing special.  I'd definitely come back for the banana bread muffins and the Diablo potatoes.  Need something? They have a happy and a sad egg posted on each table, if you need something just switch it over to the unhappy egg and someone will come by and ask if you need something.  Its almost like a Brazilian BBQ where theres the green light and red light.  Though they seemed very efficient, i dont think anyone really need to use this.",

It was busy, but we got seated within 10 mins for a party of 4. Our server was a familiar face, when I say familiar, he was also from the Islands. Friendly and attentive service, Ethan was very welcoming.   We ordered:  Chile Relleno Omellette, the Bacon Avocado, bacon egg sandwich. All the meals came with potatoes and a banana muffin.  Everything was seasoned just right. The portions are generous. We had to take a meal to go. We shared a great conversation with Ethan. Next time you're in Vegas, stop by for a hearty, comforting meal.",

We stopped at this location for breakfast because it was close to Ethel M.  They have large quantities and are big on quality. Everything was good. Came in on Sunday morning around 10 am and the wait was only 15 mins. They work as a team, so the service is great.  I had the blackened prime rib benny on a croissant. So flavorful. My son had the chicken fried steak.... we all had some of his breakfast. It was a lot and very tasty!  My daughter ordered off the kid's menu and she had a cheesy egg scramble. She wasn't able to finish hers because she kept sneaking bites of the chicken fried steak. Their breakfast burritos are also big enough to share.  I would definitely go back again and try some of their other options.",

I finally got a chance to try it this past holiday weekend with my boyfriend and friends and was very impressed. Not too crowded, got seated right away, and because I checked into Yelp that day I got a free banana nut muffin, which was delicious!!   The menu was a little overwhelming , but they have a lot to offer and I was not complaining. I was torn between getting a traditional eggs Benedict  and corned beef hash. But as someone still looking for the best eggs Benedict , I had to try theirs.   Food came out fairly quickly and the portions were pretty big, especially the fried potatoes.   As of right now my favorite eggs Benedict is still from Squeeze In , but their eggs Benedict was pretty dang good and had good flavor. My favorite part of the dish was the fried potatoes as it was like having French fries in the morning and the really good crispy ones.   Overall, I was pleased with this place and would come back for some good breakfast. I am aware they have multiple locations throughout Vegas and assume the other places are just as good. Def a place I recommend stopping by if you don't want to get an expensive breakfast and somewhere that is outside of the strip.",

The host seated us at a large booth that was both clean and comfortable. The menus were at the table so we immediately perused their breakfast and lunch offerings. My husband ordered the eggs, sausage patties and fruit. My son ordered tortilla soup, my other son ordered a Philly cheesesteak sandwich, my daughter ordered a Denver omelette with fruit, and I ordered a yogurt parfait. My husband and I chose coffee and ice water; my daughter drank lemonade and my sons ordered Pepsi.  Our waitress was friendly and attentive. She was patient as well because my son didn't like the Philly cheesesteak; she took it back and substituted a cheese omelette with home fries for him because she stated that they want customers to be happy with their meals. Come hungry because they feed you here! The portions are large and filling. They use the freshest ingredients and everything is made to order. My daughter has Celiac Disease so she has to be very careful where she eats and what she orders. It's possible to eat here but one must inquire with their waitress or waiter prior to ordering their food. We checked in on Yelp and received a free banana nut muffin-yummy! This is the second time my husband and I have ate at this restaurant but the first visit to this location which is conveniently located close to McCarran International Airport. We used a Groupon and I had to pay $24.00 more dollars plus I left a $10 tip for our wonderful waitress. I recommend dining at one of their restaurants. We've been to the Eastern location as well. Their restaurants are clean, welcoming and efficient. The staff is great!",

There really isn't anything like this in LA...[i.e., huge portions, delicious, reasonably priced].  My bf & I usually order a skillet and the original breakfast burrito. Both are super delicious, all thanks to those lovely potatoes on the side. The skillet actually has the potatoes all on the bottom and then covers them with cheese, eggs, and other goodies depending on what you order. You definitely have to try one!!! The breakfast burrito is my bf's favorite. I'm not sure if I like it as much as him...but I'm always down for a breakfast burrito. I think it's the salsa that makes it really.   We tried ordering the Cabo burrito...that was a BUST.. it's a wet burrito...too wet if you ask me..and it just lacked depth of flavor in my opinion. Won't be ordering that again.   Otherwise, the service is good and the staff is friendly. I will be returning the next time I'm in town. You should too!!",

Not only did Ashely provide spectacular service, but she also pretty sexy. Much love. Try the steak and eggs.",

TV's are all around (but not overdone) which is great to wake up on a Saturday and start watching some sports - loved it.  The menu was cute and fun - not to mention a great selection  My wife had the jeuvos rancheros which were good. I had the chili (which was OK - probably out of a can though) and onion rings.  Now the onion rings were obviously the frozen type - but just so tasteless and meaningless that you wonder why they even bother to put it on their menu.  All the other food looks so appetizing, then you have these crappy onion rings.  They would be better off to upgrade them or take them off the menu. I wish that I would have stuck to egg-based menu items...  The service was excellent, and everyone was very nice.    Oh yea, and the wifi (while free) did not work (strong signal, just wouldn't put you online after connecting).",

I would have been having breakfast here everyday if I had known it would have been this awesome. It was busy to begin with, with a 15 minute wait time and me being impatient. I figured it must be good to be waiting so long, either that or I'll end up hangry. My family and I tried the breakfast burritos which are huge and tasty! The chilli wasn't our favorite but dear lord, please try their burgers. The breakfast styled burger was epic. Packed a lot of flavor and so many fresh ingredients. If you can, also try their banana nut muffins! They are worth the trip! The customer service was top notch. Our server Perry, was phenomenal. Took good care of us and was very informative. Can't wait to come back",

I didn't give it 5 stars because they had no strawberries for my waffel. And the sausage links I had did not taste good. Tasted burnt. :P other wise great experience as always we'll be back.",

Also also also, many of their waitresses are tattooed cuties and nice as all get out. Finally, their bloody marys will kill you. In a good way.",

The Chili Omelet is great as well.  Their seasoned potatoes are just plain delicious and they serve alcohol.  Beer for breakfast?  Indeed.  I used to live right down the street but have moved further away.  My wife and I still try to hit this place up at least once a month.

The entrance to the restrooms is decorated like an outhouse-disturbing, but cute!  2.  If it is your first time, they give you a delicious muffin  3.  Unlike everywhere else in Vegas, they leave the carafe of coffee on the table, and outfit you with all the sweeteners and flavored/unflavored dairy/non-dairy creamers your heart could ever desire  4.  The eggs benedict is probably the best in Vegas (not the best ever, by any means, but definitely fantastic)  5.  It's one of those \"pay at the register when you are done\" kind of places; just don't forget to leave the tip  .  That's all I got folks, so get out there and enjoy some Egg Works!",

My favorite is the Bandito scramble: a mix of chorizo, jalapeno, and eggs, topped with sour cream and salsa.  Here's what separates Egg Works from the rest of the pack:  1. the potatoes. I prefer potatoes over hash browns 9/10 times. I don't know what kind of seasoning they put on these things, but like Terry P. said, they're like crack. 2. coffee creamer. I don't know if this is available at other places, but here they offer flavored creamer to go with your cup o' joe. I really appreciate this because I like my coffee \"girlie\". 3. the banana nut muffin. Warm. Delicious. And that muffin top... Just go have one. 'Nuff said.",

The muffin was....well let me just say i finished it in like 3 seconds. Prob the best muffin I ever had.  My sister didn't eat her CFS so they took the charge off the receipt.

The staff is usually terrific and is so wonderful to my 8 year old daughter, who changes her mind 10 times before the order comes out--from the type of drink she wanted to the type of toast--they have always accomodated her.

    "text": "Their prices are very reasonable in my opinion because they give you large portions. I've only been to this location twice (2nd time was today), and I have to say that while the food is good, their customer service is lacking. We were seated right away since it was only 2 people, and we got our drinks fast, but the waitress did not bother to take our meal orders until maybe 15-20 min later. and the waitress who actually took our order was not the one who gave us our drinks. She was shocked that no one had taken our order and apologized. I don't care how busy you are. I just think to wait 20 minutes just to order is a little ridiculous. On a scale of 1-10, I'd rate their food a 7. I'm surprised that a restaurant who serves eggs doesn't have healthier options listed on the menu. You can substitute the potatoes for fruit and the muffin/toast is optional. I think this should be listed on the menu. All the omelets have cheese on them. So you need to say no cheese if you don't want it. No big deal. I just think it's not the most health-conscious menu. I also didn't see anything about egg whites on there. You just have to ask for that. The inside is not nice at all. It looks like the inside of a McDonald's. It's a little loud in there too.   Overall, if you want to go to a cheap place and don't mind waiting a long time for your order to be taken, then you should go here. You'll get large portions and the prices are good.  However, if you're looking for quality, a nice atmosphere, and a staff that comes by your table to see how you're doing (general customer service), I don't recommend it.",

Oh and I can't forget that banana nut muffin they serve that comes with certain dishes.  When they bring it to you, it's nice and warm and goes so well with your coffee!  My favorite new items on the menu are the Hawaiian breakfast dishes (spam with eggs and rice, Portuguese sausage, and I can't remember the other one; there are only 3). It's good food, inexpensive, and the waiters are really attentive.  What more can you ask for?",

We only waited about 10 minutes. That was a shock. Our server was Kim and she was outstanding. The food was OK. I had regular pancakes, eggs over medium, and bacon. She asked if I wanted the bacon crisp and it was (crispy and good). The eggs were runnier than I wanted (maybe my fault for not asking for over hard). I am a pancake lover and the pancakes were some of the worst that I've had a restaurant. I didn't like the taste of the batter and they were too heavy and doughy. My partner tried them and liked them. He had waffles, ham and scrambled. He didn't like his waffle and neither did I. Something about the batter. ANYWAY...The place is called Egg Works...I will go back. I liked the atmosphere. I really enjoyed the employees. They were all very nice, helpful, and funny. Next time, I will focus on an egg dish which I'm sure will be very good. Oh...we did order a banana nut muffin because so many Yelp reviewers talked about it. It was definitely delicious and I'll stick to that next time. There will be a next time...",

Love the fact that they leave you a pot of coffee on the table, no waiting for refills. They had french vanilla and irish cream creamers to choose from-another plus. I ordered the Veggie skillet-no spinach-extra mushrooms. It was really good and they used fresh mushrooms. Finding a good skillet is almost impossible here in Las Vegas. I will order this again. My Dad had the french toast  which he said was good.  Banana muffin was warmed a little too much, but still very good.",

The chorizo was a little bland (shocking for the normally intense sausage it is) and my home fries were covered with so much seasoning a fan of salt such as myself couldn't really enjoy it.  Finally you have to pay up front and if you want them to split your check prepare to be the asshole that holds up the whole line for like 15 minutes. me and my friends were those assholes but honestly get more than one register, you probably seat 70+ people at a time and you can afford it.",

So, when my BFF asked me to come with her to use her Groupon, I braced myself for mediocrity.  Boy was I surprised!  Our sever Dolly was so sweet, too. I was excited when I saw the chicken enchilada omelette because I never even thought about making that at home!  So, Dolly said it was amazing, and I ordered it with corn tortillas on the side (it just makes more sense, right?).  The Chicken  enchilada omelette definitely made my mouth happy!  I needed a bit more of their extra smoky enchilada sauce on the side, and the potatoes that accompanied were also equally impressive .I can't believe that the food was so well seasoned. Usually I need a whole lot of salt and pepper for the eggs and potatoes, but not at Egg Works!    The little happy and sad egg faces on the table were a nice touch,  too. As soon as I flipped to a sad egg  I had a sever coming over to check on me before I could even say \"egg works.\"  I like the concerted effort of all of the wait staff to ensure that every customer is pleased regardless of whether or not it's \"their station.\"  Yes, I will definitely be back in the future to try some more of their unique breakfast creations! I'm a HAPPY EGG!  :-)",

Got the Hawaiian breakfast with white rice and Portuguese sausage. Unlike most restaurants, which give you three measly coin sized pieces, Egg Works actually give you the entire sausage! And of course, in typical Hawaii plate lunch style - with two scoops of white rice. Perfect.  I've also tried the chili omelet. A chili omelet smothered with melted cheese and, again, I got it with two scoops of white rice (tastes better this way than with breakfast potatoes!). Again, perfection.   These guys rock.",

I highly recommend the skillets - they have different variations but the basics are: potatoes, bell peppers, onions, cheese, egg to top it off. The variable is chicken, steak, veggies, chili, etc. very filling. For those with smaller bellys, I recommend sharing. Also, if you check in on yelp it's a free banana nut muffin that you can't go wrong with.   The service was good and I would definitely go again.",

Found this place through a combo TripAdvisor/Yelp search and glad we made the drive.  They offer a diverse breakfast menu that provides more alternatives than your typical breakfast options.  I had a chili relleno omelette - a dish I don't know that I've seen elsewhere and enjoyed a lot.  Also at our table were a pork chop breakfast meal, and veggie omelette.  Everyone really liked their food.  Service was great.  Place has a nice mom and pop vibe.  Recommended.",

The menu is 8-pages long so if eggs are \"not\" your thing you WILL find something to tempt your tastebuds!!! As soon as we arrived, Chris was right there with coffee and a FREE warm banana nut muffin. We said we would share and his response was that once we tasted it, there would be no sharing.  And wow.  There is no doubt it is the best banana nut muffin I ever had. Did I say WOW?? I had the homemade corn beef hash.  WOW. And my husband had the Loco Moco. I am stuffed.  I can't eat another bite.  I may not eat again for 2 days!!! Lol. Seriously loved every bite. And Chris has the best hospitality skills I have seen in a long time!!! Being a Southwest flight attendant I know hospitality!!  If I ever own my own business, I am coming to steal Chris away!!! And you can have your extra muffin to go if you do not want toast!  And he offered us a cup of coffee to go!!! EGGS-TRAORDINARY!!!",

    "text": "***EDIT 2/10*** The owner reached out to me to ask who our server was to \"address the issue.\" Quite frankly they should address the issue that is themselves. I did not appreciate that they would want to throw their own staff under the bus when I called them out on inflating their yelp reviews.   AVOID. The owner has found a way to cleverly inflate their yelp reviews. They spend their advertising budget on their staff; by offering a Disneyland trip to the server with the most 5 star reviews. This is clearly a great way for the staff to solicit 5 star reviews based on service and not food. Sorry, but I'd rather have great food and shitty service than shitty food and awesome service.   When the metric is based of names in 5 star yelp reviews, how do you expect your servers to not solicit reviews? Or even mention it?  ***  This place has Falsely inflated yelp reviews. I got duped into checking this place out and the food was no different from any other typical American diner breakfast places. Why such a low review? Food was mediocre. Ordered the avocado and chicken egg white omelet and it wasn't very memorable. The potatoes are generously covered in what was very similar to Lawry's seasoning salt. Also had the country fried steak skillet. The sausage gravy was good; aside from that I was not impressed with the food. The over easy egg was sitting in a puddle of grease and the egg white portions were rubbery.   Our server was patient and great and we got free banana muffins upon yelp check in. At the end of our visit, our server asked us for a 5 star review and asked for us to write her name in the review. Apparently the owner of this place will gift a trip to Disneyland to the server who convinces the most guests to write 5 star reviews. Hmmmmmmmmmmm.....  This totally works against what Yelp is for. A consolidation of reviews and ratings; this place does NOT have a 4.5 star rating for its food. I would consider it a 3 star place AT BEST. If it was correctly rated, I wouldn't have wasted stomach space and a meal at this restaurant.   If you don't believe me, take the time and read through the various reviews; you'll notice that majority of them will reference a server name, some of them talk about Disney or Disneyland trips. Frankly a restaurant smack out in Las Vegas should not have any references to Disney or Disneyland trips unless they were serving up Mickey Mouse shaped pancakes.   AVOID. (Unless you're a local and have plenty of opportunities to eat around Vegas and don't care for a wasted meal)",

Every waiter we've had has been super nice and accommodating. Never have had a problem with food. Great spot for travelers too. We always usually sit inside but today the wait was awhile so we chose to dine outside. It was nice and shaded. It was still a bit hot but not miserable. I do suggest that they add misters and maybe some nice music for those outside. Other than that I love it. So did my kids since they get to see planes pass by.   Today I ordered the Prime Rib Benny. It never fails. I always order a Benny from here. Also with biscuits and gravy on the side. My kids got French toast w/ sausage and mouse pancakes w/ bacon. I just wish they would have added whipped cream and a bit more berries on the pancakes. It came with 3 blueberries lol. But that's me being picky lol. My husband got steak and Eggs with sticky rice. He ordered medium rare and he got it medium well. He said it was still good.   So if you're looking for a nice place to brunch with the family give Egg Works a shot. This place is awesome!   **oh also! Check in using yelp app and you get a free banana Nut Muffin on your first check in **",

    "text": "This is one of those staples for locals. Quality breakfasts with lots of personality and a sense of identity in everything from their house-branded sauces, to the fact that they offer Hawaiian meals like loco moco in addition to the traditional American fare. Today my coworker and I went for a pre-shift breakfast and were promptly and politely seated by Morgan. We each ordered the Smokey Chipotle Pork Benny with Habla Diablo potatoes, add diced peppers and onions. The result was fantastic. The pork, although smothered in sauce, still retained some tenderness, and the English muffins stayed crispy and fluffy. The potatoes were hot, crispy, and super flavorful, and the eggs were nice and runny inside. I will say that the chipotle hollandaise is a strange pairing, with the sweet and sour flavors kind of fighting the spice, but the addition of their house hot sauce tied it all back together. Overall an adventure of rich flavors, and a meal I will be thinking about for days. Our server seemed a little preoccupied, or maybe he was just giving us extra time to decide, but on our way out, Morgan again came over very quickly to take our payment and wish us a good day.",

    "text": "I was in Vegas for a business trip, and on my final day of training, my trainer took me out for lunch to egg works. It's right by where I was training & I heard only good things about it. I was advised to try the \"sunrise mountain\" - an open faced croissant with eggs, loads of cheese, and meat of your choice (yes they have Turkey options) & a side of seasoned potatoes.. So I did look over the menu, but I ended up going with the sunrise mountain after all, and boy was I in for a treat! It was so big & so cheesy & so delicious!! I was stuffed full about halfway through, but powered through til the end - it was so good! I would highly recommend it! The place was also so cute and small and the staff was friendly~ The menu was a newspaper & the incredible aromas in there made the whole place so home-y~ I loved this place! I doubt I will ever find myself in Vegas again, but I would certainly eat here again if I did!",

Quick service and within seconds i always get my own carafe of coffee.     Food is always pretty solid here.  Aim more for the omelets though.  I've gotten waffles and pancakes here and they're fine.  But you'll probably forget what you ate after about an hour because they didn't leave an impression.  My go to favorite though is the Chili Rellano omelet.  My mouths watering now just thinking about it.  Slap some hot sauce on that bad boy and you got this cheesy, chili, egg, spicy piece of deliciousness in your mouth.   I always go to work and brag about what I ate after that sucker.  Give this place a go.  Solid service and decent food.",

The side of sausage came when I was halfway through the meal. Usually when I come here the service is really good, today, it was just ok. The restaurant was pretty busy (noon on a Friday) and the service was a bit frantic and at times hard to get. The waiter didn't even bother giving his name or asking for a Yelp review, perhaps he already knew things had been a bit subpar (the receipt listed CJ as the waiter). Still, on average, a very good restaurant and I recommend it.",

Anyways...to keep it short we were sat fairly fast for how busy it was and greeted right away. Candice was our server and she was very pleasant and positive. She did say that she had just gotten there and yet I saw her get double sat and pick up tables outside of her section. You go girl! Our food came out fast and the manager re filled our drinks. I'd say it was only about 30 minutes we were there- the average breakfast time. But Candice made sure to say good bye to us and have a wonderful day. She was awesome. Thanks Candice- we'll be back!",

The last few times I've gone to the Sunset location and had a seat at the bar and are served by Shantel. This girl is awesome, she's always so friendly and not afraid to start up a quick conversation. Usually I request pineapple with my meal instead of the potatoes and now she ALWAYS has that delicious chili lime seasoning placed on the counter without a hesitation!

I was at this location on Monday and the server Robert must have been having a bad day or simply was not in the mood to serve us. I'm a cheerful person and greeted this guy with a smile seriously happy with the service I had received in Henderson only to be disappointed by this Robert and his lack of courtesy.  We were not greeted but rather given a blank stare and rudely asked \"do you know what you want to order\" not welcoming at all. These type of people really upset me I mean how hard is it to give someone a smile and extend the same courtesy that's been given to you. This was my second visit to an Egg Works and will stay away from this location. I'm one that doesn't complain to management but rather one that values my money and simply does not return. I hope this review is considered as a coaching opportunity for this guy. The service I received was horrible. His negative demeanor and the unpleasant look on his face was disappointing he simply did not want to be there. Food and service do not go hand in hand. In my industry GREAT SERVICE is the key component in creating great dinning experiences. Bad service, no customers, no customer, no money. I will never compromise service over food it's all or nothing.",

I'm typically a creature of habit when it comes to food, but I have found it real easy to branch out and try something new with all the different menu options, both breakfast and lunch. The service is always fast and friendly and the food is always amazing. Whenever I have any family in town, I always take them here knowing it will be a great dining experience for them while on vacation. Even my 1 year old likes it here! I will order him a side of avocado and give him bite of the delicious fresh baked banana nut muffins. They even make sure to give him another straw after he's thrown his previous one on the floor for the hundredth time! And to top it off, it's only a short drive from my house.  Great food, friendly, prompt service, wonderful menu options, kid-friendly and convenient. No wonder this place is always busy! I can't wait to be back again soon!",

Eden was so friendly and patient. They're salsa is delicious too. They care that your food is perfect too. If it's not right they take it back and make it perfect. Eggs any way you can imagine.

Everything here was off the chart.  When asked if we had been here before, we told our server, Donna, no.  She promptly greeted us with a warm, homemade banana muffin.  It was ridiculously good.  I had the country \"Benny\".  To me, the sign of a good breakfast joint is whether or not they know how to make good country gravy.  Again, theirs was better than most.  The potatoes were awesome and it felt like they gave you about 3 pounds worth.  If you are looking for a great breakfast, don't pass this place up!",

Most diner/breakfast places, even when great, have all the basics, but this place has about 80 variations on eggs. Scrambles, hashes, and more - they even have 8 different kinds of poached eggs.  I had the Smokey Chipotle Pork Benny, and both the pork and sauce were outstanding. They also bring you a free banana nut muffin with Yelp check in. I wasn't expecting much, but it was so well made, and it came out hot.   This is very close to the airport, so it's a great stop on the way in or out of Vegas.",

I actually think my parents used to make breakfast of that size for our family of 6 to share (and feel satisfied). It's sooo much food.  The food itself was pretty good.

I decided on the Veggie Bennie because I love avocado and it was great. I asked for the hollandaise sauce on the side which was probably a smart move because the cup was huge! The breakfast potatoes are really good and seasoned perfectly, and the service was pretty fast. There's a reason this place has a line--because it's delicious!  Great place to come for brunch or breakfast with friends or family. Would definitely return... I wanna try that banana nut French toast!  Check in to get the free banana nut muffin!!! It's worth it!",

Our waitress was Maya and she was very helpful. This place is great for a table for two or a large party. Bring the Fam! 3) I. Love. Eggs. 90% of the menu is eggs. DOUBLE SCORE!   CONS 1) They looooove their seasoned potatoes. They come with almost every meal. They come with a house seasoning that is good but it's very salty: A bit too much for my liking but if you're into very salty breakfast potatoes then this could be your thing!   Happy breakfast!",

I highly recommend the banana nut muffin (comes with most breakfast options) and my favorite the Loco Moco. I learned about this dish in Hawaii but you actually make it better here than they do there in my opinion.   They hire a cool staff of fun people. You can tell that they enjoy working with one another which I really dig. I've also seen a lot of the same workers still there since the first time I visited. I usually sit at the breakfast bar for the free entertainment. Every time I'm there I always notice one person that stands out a little (no pun intended lol) from the rest. Little Ash.   She's always jammin all around to be sure everyone is taken care of while at the same time keeping things in order at the food line. Great energy and a natural born leader no doubt. Watching her control the flow of the kitchen is pretty impressive. If you get the chance to have her serve you then you'll probably receive the best service you've ever had there. She's very personable and goes out of her way to be sure you're taken care of and that you know your business is appreciated there. Something that seems more and more rare at restaurants.   Everyone there works as a team so it's never a surprise that the service is on point. They have a great system in place and even better food so it's no wonder why there are multiple locations around town. I highly recommend Egg Works and Ash as your server.",

Coffee tasted old and burnt. I ordered the basic eggs potatoes and sausage and added a plain cake. I was sad I had to pay the full entree price for both (add on cake price where I manage)   What was great was the muffin. Warm, moist and delicious. I contiplated buying the loaf to take back, but didn't think i would be able to keep it in tack during my  flight home. The pancake was moist, huge and tasty. The eggs were not whole fresh eggs, tasted like the carton kind. I guess I should have ordered overhard. The potatoes were over seasoned and covered in paprika the worst thing I tasted on my whole trip.  I would suggest the muffin only.",

    "text": "Crikey! We've got a screamer here but not as entertaining as Gordon Ramsey. Don't sit at the counter unless you want to hear this little spitfire lady scream out every 2 minutes: \"I need a runner here!\"   Oh boy, I NEED AN ASPIRIN.  I might have put up with the clucking of the loud obnoxious lead waitress at the pass screaming out for service had the food been at least worth it. My waitress was very sweet and helpful in describing what's good to eat. She was pushing the hash as the best thing on the menu. I decided to play it safe with a cheese omelet. I struck out on this one. The omelet was rubbery and the potatoes were greasy which really did a number on me a few hours later. I don't know what they put in the potatoes but they had a rancid taste and the slight smell and taste of vinegar. The portions are ridiculousness huge but considering the double wide waste lines of the patrons in this joint, I can see why the customers don't complain.   Another reason not to sit at the counter: the absolutely most disgusting thing I have read in a restaurant or for that matter read anywhere in public, except maybe in a doctors exam room, was pasted on the wall right in front of me at the lunch counter.   Are you ready? Wait...if you are eating and reading put your fork down now. Fair warning....here it comes: (Remember I didn't get that warning as I was eating my rubber omelet). When you sit at a lunch counter, it's normal to glance around and stare directly ahead of you. My attention was drawn to a cheeky sign that read \"Will trade coffee for gossip\". Ok, that's typical coffee house cute. That's not the bad part. Below this sign there is a typed notice from management to the employees on when it is acceptable for an employee to be excused from coming to work: There are five reasons and I only got to read up to # 2 before I lost my appetite reading about projectile bodily functions. The sign says something to the affect that in order to protect the health of the other workers and patrons, the following reasons are acceptable accuses for not coming to work. They are: 1: Vomiting. 2: Diarrhea, 3: who knows what the rest said. Bleh!   So there I sat with little miss spitfire hollering out for service on my right, I got the busboy on my left drying all the flatware and clanging them into containers while giving me the stink eye every so often. I've got this sign in front of me that I should have taken as a warning for my afternoon discomfort to come! Earlier, the waitress offered to give me a sampling of the hash, which thankfully she forget to bring. I pushed the rubber egg aside, grabbed the check and headed to the cashier. When the cashier asked me if everything was alright, I asked her if she thought that was appropriate to post that sign at the lunch counter for customers to read. She was grossed out as much as I was and said she would talk to management. Not an entirely pleasant breakfast experience at Egg Works.  My stomach is still churning from the obnoxious breakfast and the sound of the waitress screaming \"I need a runner here!\" is still in my head. Oye!",

The  Sunrise Mountain was ok, the croissant was bland and the whole dish felt like it was missing something.   Grandma's Biscuits and Gravy had excellent gravy, but the biscuits didn't go well with it.  The potato's were excellent on both dishes. I'm not a huge fan of banana nut muffins, but that was probably the softest muffin I have ever had.  The service was spot on and made the visit worth it. Our food was out quickly, our waitress was overly attentive, and other waitresses got us water as they walked by.  I want to go back and try there the seven other things I want on the menu",

I order dry wheat toast, gives it to me with butter...its a mistake. No big deal. I ask for toast without butter. 10 minutes later I get the toast. I'm done now! She was to busy helping sit another customer when there was already a hostess who's job was to seat people. After she seats them she goes in the back and runs her mouth some more and then finally realizes she forgot the toast. Jennifer, I was not upset about the mistake of the toast I was upset by your poor services I need the toast when I got my food not when I'm done.",

The portions are big. The kids meal are big enough for two kids to share unless you have a big eater.   I ordered pork and eggs, potatoes, and toast. Since I cannot eat eggs, the waitress let me substitute fruit for the eggs. The potatoes were delicious. It was seasoned and like the potatoes that you get with hash.  My husband ordered stuffed french toast. He thought they were stuffed with fruit and cream cheese (his mistake), but when it came out it was like a french toast sandwich. An egg scramble with meat between two pieces of french toast. The waitress was willing to exchange it for the strawberry and cream cheese french toast (which is the one that he was looking at), but my husband's mistake so he kept his plate. He did enjoy his breakfast. The other people at our table ordered the banana nut french toast and the loco moco. They both were happy with what they ordered. Our waitress was very nice. She kept our drinks filled as best as she could since the restaurant was completely packed. We didn't mention that it was our first time to the restaurant, but she must have figured it out with some of our questions. She brought some warm banana nut muffin to the table, and they were delicious.  We will definitely be coming here more often on our future trips to Vegas.",

Egg Works happens to be one of my favorites due to their friendly staff, comfy atmosphere, and most importantly, their fantastic selection of breakfast goodies. Their menu can be daunting to those of feeble breakfast tastes....but to a True breakfast maverick like myself, it is always a joy to peruse the menu on your hunt for a bellyful of wonderful. And you WILL get a bellyful. Large portions abound, from the fresh made muffins, to the skillets, omelettes, and all the other egg creations. Larger parties may have to wait to be seated, but good things come to those with patience. For those without, there is a fine McDonald's in the same parking lot. My latest trip there was last week and Donna was our server. She was spot on with getting my coffee, and although my dining companion was a bit tardy, she kept checking on me while I waited and enjoyed their delicious morning brew. Once my  cohort arrived, we ordered and were served our delicious meals shortly after. Halfway through, my buddy realized he didn't get his muffin. We asked Donna as she passed by about it and after a quick apology brought not one, but TWO muffins. One was consumed, and the other was taken home for a latter morning treat. Kudos to you, Donna, and your fine establishment.  :)",

Egg Works has it and I ordered it with two fried eggs on top (there is no other way!) First off, those fried potatoes they serve are the bomb! Crispy and evenly browned, not even remotely greasy. The husband and I gobbled them like fiends. The gravy definitely passed muster with my mid-western heart...rich and loaded with meaty flavor, and no pastiness. My eggs were perfectly cooked, as were my husband's. The biscuits were weird, tough and chewy. No fluffiness here...and they are an odd artificial golden yellow color, throughout. We actually scanned the menu to see what we could get that delish gravy on next time, because I never want to bite one of those creepy biscuits again. We'll be back to try their other offerings, because the plates that sailed by us on their way to other diners looked quite tempting. Coffee was just meh.. not yucky, just meh. We'll order tea next time and find something to smother with that gravy!",

We hopped in the car and headed to this joint. Upon arriving the parking lot was full and this is sometimes a good sign... If you think about it like a fisherman... If you follow all the birds you will find fish. Anyways, we walked in and were sat immediately, Now none of us out of the group had ever been there and the waitress informed us because it was our first time there they throw in free banana nut muffins which happen to be delicious. I then took some time to look over the newspaper... I mean menu and chose the country Benny. How do you go wrong with a biscuit covered in Eggs and country gravy.. Well a coronary is how you go wrong but the food was great. The food came out very fast. The waitress was crazy friendly and on top of all the drinks. I was extremely happy with this choice and will be back for sure!",

I finally ate here this past weekend and figured  it would be good due to the masses of people that are constantly there. But no. After a 20 minute wait, my friend and I were packed into an over crowded area with the world's heaviest cast iron chairs. Yes, the waitress was prompt and helpful, but that unfortunately does not help the food. Anyone who has ever been happy with an IHOP breakfast will be sorely disappointed at the repast. Some decently scrambled eggs, chewy bacon and Egg Work potatoes that were essentially frozen, seasoned, bagged potato squares. I got a tiny OJ that came with no refills for 3.25. My friend's dish, the Mexican omelette, was a greasy, cheesy, salsa drowned nightmare that was nearly inedible and she was sad. Next time, we're hitting IHOP or McDonald's- cheap and reliable- or I'm just going to go back to my house and make my own breakfast.",

We had tried the Egg and I so we said lets see what the sister location has to offer. Happy to say the same great food and menu as Egg and I. This location is newer and has a different look and feel. The thing that stands out immediately are the 7+ plasma screens throughout the restaurant. The service here was quick and efficient. They also had the same wonderful banana nut muffin. This time we decided to try the country benny and the works skillet. Both items were great and plentiful. There are so many items on the menu, a bit overwhelming. This location is a hop skip and a jump from the airport runway, they are in a strip mall right next to a Wells Fargo bank. I'm still not a fan of their potatoes, it would be great if they offered hash browns too. I do recommend this place to anyone who wants to get away from casino fare and wants a hearty breakfast with great service.",

    "text": "My first Review so Suck Up Tha Positive Vibes!!!  Who would have known that a Breakfast could be so Good!!!  First of all I had my doubts about this place.  It is on the Corner of Sunset and Eastern in a business complex that seems empty most of the time.  I don't even look in that direction when driving down sunset.  But when you walk up to the restaurant and see a sea of people waiting to be seated, you know that something must be going right.  Yet our wait at the back of 15 people only took about 15 - 20 minutes...crazy.  Once seated you can usually judge the entire visit by how fast you are asked for your drink order.  3 minutes (yes I usually time it) is all it took for a very friendly person to ask and another 3 minutes to have my coffee and orange juice delivered in front of me.    I ended up ordering the Carnitas (which was recommended by our server) which was incredible.  Pricing wasn't cheap (I think the Carnitas was about $11 and coffee $2.50) but is definetely worth it for the portion and flavor.    Honestly I have to give this place 5 stars which normally never happens.  I usually pick apart an establishment because I truly believe in Great Customer Service when dining out.  Food, though extremely important, comes second. Egg Works was extremely busy with people buzzing in and out and our server never skipped a beat.  There was such a smooth flow to all the craziness that you don't see anywhere.    If you are looking for somewhere great to eat, with great food, and awesome service....You have to stop by and Try this place.  OH and I almost forgot....THEY PLAY SUNDAY FOOTBALL ON THE FLAT SCREENS THAT ARE HANGING EVERYWHERE!!!",

    "text": "I've been dining at egg works for a very long time now, at only this location. I'd say close to 10 times. I think it's time that I finally write a review of this place. Recently, my experiences at egg works have been very disappointing. I think one of the reasons is because of how big this company is getting. I believe it's falling into a classic company downfall where the company is sacrificing quality/consistency/customer satisfaction while expanding as a whole.  My last experience will probably keep me from coming into this restaurant again. I don't eat pork, religiously. Neither does my girlfriend for personal reasons. Anyway, the last 4 times I've eaten here, we've found bacon/ham in our food. For me, it's come three times in my Chicken/mushroom/spinach skillet. And for my girl, its come once in her VEGGIE omelet. It happens once, maybe twice, no big deal. But it happening a total of 4 times is a little ridiculous. Yesterday, (10/14/2012), it happened again. I'm not the type of person who sends things back or gets fussy about things, so I informed my server, picked the ham out, and continued to eat my meal. (after the server asked to redo the dish, but who wants to sit and wait while everyone around them is eating) My girlfriend, who got the egg white veggie omelet, ate all around the edges of her omelet because the inside was so under done that it was mostly all liquid inside. We also got one of their pumpkin pancakes, but that also was underdone in the middle.  After all of the things that have gone wrong with this meal and informing our polite server about them (while we weren't assholes or fussy about our meal) we got no attention from the restaurant manager. I'm sorry, but you just served someone pork, someone who doesn't eat pork for religious reasons, and you don't apologize for your kitchens mistake? Nor apologize for the simple cooking mistakes made through out the entire meal? Naturally, nothing was taken off the bill. Not even a comp'd coffee.  Now, I understand that a Sunday is very busy, but when a restaurant makes this many mistakes in turning out food, it maybe time to start looking towards upgrading the kitchen staff or increasing the amount of people in the back of the house. It seems that this restaurant, while makes a good breakfast, fails to execute in their dishes. It's frustrating because they're so miniscule, but they're simply overlooked at this restaurant.",

My wife and I enjoyed the very good service with no surprises. I thought the potatoes they offer are good, but my wife prefers a different style than what was offered. The coffee was merely OK. They must be doing something right because it was obvious from the crowded parking lot they are popular and busy. Enjoyable change!",

Pretty much two plates of food since i asked for the french toast to be 'unstuffed'  The potatoes were TO DIE FOR, and I would go back simply just for these potatoes....  It's a lil bit pricey for me, ~$10 per order but the food is AMAZING",

    "text": "A must every time we visit Las Vegas!   You know this place sells alot of egg dishes when the delivery truck delivers eggs by the stacked case - and many of them.  You can get your egg dishes just about any way you like them and know that you'll have a good experience. I tend to favorite the California Omelet which has tomato, fresh avocado and mushrooms, along with melted Swiss and hollandaise sauce. The omelet alone is more than enough at 3 eggs, but they include some great potatoes (or another side) and a banana nut muffin which is usually good, but this time tasted a tad off. I didn't mind the muffin, but my kids didn't enjoy them as much this time.  Their service style is interesting - flip your metallic \"egg\" at the table if you're unhappy to get someone's attention. Neat concept!  Warning - portions are LARGE. If you're traveling, you'll likely feel like you're wasting food unless you choose to share (they may charge for that, but it's not excessive). After the muffins, I could only eat \"most of the omelet and a small bit of potatoes before feeling stuffed.",

I shared half of the omelet with my sis. It's good. The waitress are very nice with smile on their faces, but we waited too long for our food. We had to keep nagging them for our orders. The people who came in later than us got their order before us. ummm, not so good. The price is good for that big portion. You should try this restaurant if you've never been there. :)",

The fresh veggie omelette was good and was glad they offered egg white options as well. Along with this came seasoned potatoes and choice of bread (white, wheat, rye, etc...). The potatoes were magical; within a few bites I forgot I was supposed to limit my carb intake in the first place. The French toast is legit and I would be happy to order another plate.   However, I can't say the same for the pancakes which caused some Aunt Jemima-preservative-box variety deja vu: disappointingly dry, flavorless, and let me feeling like a bloated cow. Unfortunately, frugality overcame me and I tried to eat as much as I could and would later regret this decision. Decor is your standard diner than can be seen in New York to Pahrump. Oddly, giant stuffed animals have taken over part of the waiting area. I'm not sure if these dirty, dust filled monstrosities have a purpose other than to entertain inpatient children, but they need to go. Service throughout was great. Drinks were poured when needed, food didn't take forever, and the waitress gave us our bill without asking. Definitely not the fanciest place to get brunch, but it deserves some love.",

    "text": "I always take visiting family and friends here for breakfast. I've probably eaten here at least 10x within the past few years. Every friend and family I have taken here has always left feeling full and happy with the service.  The last time I was here I took a few friends who wanted to get away from the strip. They wanted a breakfast place that wasn't expensive and that wasn't your typical pancake place. Here are a few things to keep in mind:   1. Place is popular. If you think your eating at say 10am, get there at 9:30am to reserve your seat. For us they told us it was a 20 min wait but it was more like 15 min. If you have an impatient party do come in earlier.    2. There are coupons in local magazines.    3. Come in HUNGRY because the portions are generous.  The last thing I ordered was a mashed potato omelette. I think it is one of my favorite omelettes there now. My friends ordered omelettes with avocados and we were all surprise how generous the amount of avocado (not complaining here).",

    "text": "oh yeah...;)  would the \"bf\" agree on my four stars, maybe not but we are not asking him, are we?  So...visited the first day of the new year.  Seated after a 30 minute wait at about 11am (ish).  Seated, and our coffee (crappy coffee -- we cannot even discuss here) taken by a coked-out server. Prior to even being brought coffee, my bf observed (saw, with his own eyes!) our server putting his fingers in his mouth, not sure why. We caught a passing hostess, retold our \"issue\" (server/fingers/mouth = uncomfortable) and not but two minutes later...greeted by a different server --- thank you. THANK YOU! I really appreciate this attentive service and saving of our brunch/breakfast.   The bf ordered the stuffed french toast with eggies, bacon and....some sort of potato. good. not what i would order...but....what can i say.  I had, egg white omelet, with spinach (extra spinach), mushrooms, and Swiss. Could not decide if i wanted to be totally \"bad\" or just a little bit bad, so the server suggested i have 1/2 tomatoes and 1/2 some sort of potato. Thank you...for recognizing.   I did order a side of hallandise AND a side of sausage gravy --- i ordered egg whites didn't i? and i just wanted to taste... 2oz portion of each, enough to know for next time.   everything was completely greasy spoon - type, and...really what we needed, just.... wanted and...was.   this place is great.   could i cajole my bf to another meal, um...i think so. (he doesn't even like eggs - so .. i can only say 'wtf')   i was happy ...greasy spoon -- but plus plus plus...  i would probably order again my same order. it is...better than average, certainly. local. decent. no airs.... i go back.",

Besides it's a good sign if everyone loves to go there and you have to wait a bit. The inside is charming and quaint. The prices are fair and the portions are large. The food was hot,delicious, and perfectly cooked. Huge menu with something for everyone. I wish it was a buffet because I wanted to try everything! I guess that means I will just have to keep going back. No problem! Worth every penny. Definitely recommended. Enjoy!",

They have 6 locations in Vegas which tells you how popular it is.   1) Ensenada Burrito: this was good buy would've been better if the carnitas were chunky instead of pulled pork consistency. The diablo potatoes are yummy! The seasoning reminds me of curly fries.  2) Corned Beef Hash: this was typical and nothing special.   3) Banana nut muffin: comes as an option on some of the breakfasts. If not, you can also get one free with Yelp Check in. Despite all the rave reviews, I wasn't super impressed. The only thing that was unique about this was  the muffin was like a cross between a banana nut muffin and a bran muffin.",

I don't know if maybe we had a new cook or something because in looking at the photos our potatoes did not look like the photos. We were scared to order the hash browns or replace them in the event that we would be getting something other than hash browns. Oh the TOAST was awesome lol.   The muffin was great and the waiter you can tell is really acquainted with the regulars.   We both agreed after that we would work our own eggs from home from for breakfast!",

Every time we asked her something she had to ad her two cents in without us asking and re-worded or order making it seem like we didn't know what we were asking. The food was something I could have gone to a Denny's or ihop for there was nothing special about it. To top it off the fork and spoon they had for me wrapped up has egg yolk all over it. Which isn't the biggest deal, because they give you a new one and it's okay, but they decided to leave the dirty one there after giving me a new one. So every bite I'm looking at this disgusting spoon and fork that almost made me throw up.",

I was so hungry I wanted something delicious and filling before continuing on my trip and let me tell you Egg Works was the perfect place! It's nothing fancy just a cute little cafe/diner but the food was ahhhh-mazing!!! I got the chicken, mushroom, and spinach skillet breakfast. It was a layover of potatoes with chicken mushroom and spinach, cheese and eggs. It also comes with a side of toast or a banana nut muffin. The seasoning they use on the potatoes was so good! I just wanted to take a bottle of that seasoning home with me. The entire meal was delicious and so filling I ended up taking about half of it with me and since the yelp check in offer is a free banana nut muffin I had that as well. The staff was super friendly and attentive, I got my meal very quickly. This place met all of my expectations and if I ever go back to Vegas, layover or for fun, I will definitely stop by this place again.",

The banana nut bread has the appearance of a brown bran muffin, but it tastes quite the opposite. I'm not a fan of banana bread, but this was one of the best banana nut breads I've ever had! Also, when you check-in here on Yelp, you receive one free banana nut bread!  I ordered the homemade corn beef hash with scrambled eggs and my fiance ordered the three pigs omelette with extra avocado. He loved his omelette and they were extremely generous with the avocado portions.   Unfortunately, my corn beef hash did not taste like I was expecting. I only had a couple of bites by the time our check was brought to us. I informed our server, Olivia, that it didn't taste quite right to me and she was very kind and apologetic. She asked if I wanted to order anything else and after I politely declined, she brought us our check with the corn beef hash taken off from our bill. Olivia went above and beyond to make our dining experience great and we will definitely be coming back so I can try another item off their menu.",

I observed other waiters and waitresses smiling and checking with their customers. Our waitress came to take our order, deliver order and to bring our check. I had to ask other wait staff for flavored creamer, and extra napkins. Good thing we were given a carafe of coffee otherwise we would keep our egg sign on sad the entire time.

I order the Corned Beef Hash with a side of hollandaise sauce (trust me, you should too) ...any place that make their corned beef in house just has to be tasted. All the flavor notes hit perfect, and the spicy Diablo potatoes were spot on. The service was fantastic and warming. I travel for work and sat alone at the counter, but the staff made my morning memorable with friendly chit chat and great service. My one and only complaint was that I asked for my eggs over easy and I got them over hard... The runny yolk would have been amazing on the hash and potatoes... But the flavor bomb that hit my mouth on the first bite made me forget about this quickly.",

The muffins are awesome and your bang-for-your-buck is totally worth it.  We get two meals out of each plate.  Our waitress was Ashley, who was so cute and bubbly.  Typically we'll end up with a nice, though a bit jaded, waitress who struggles to keep up.  Ashley, on the other hand, was amazing.  Super attentive and engaging.

    "text": "I came here for lunch today. My server, Candice was extremely nice and helpful. She was perky but not in an annoying, fake perky way.   I ordered the carnitas crepe. It came with a banana nut muffin. The muffin tasted like it was day old and reheated. The crepe looked unappetizing sitting there with a lonely dollop of sour cream and unimaginative side of green salsa. I took a bite of the crepe and it was bleh. It was overcooked and the carnitas was unflattering and had no discernible flavor. But I loved the potatoes. I finished all of the potatoes.   When I came to the register to pay, the cashier was counting out a drawer and there were two other servers standing around. No greeting whatsoever, no \"hi, I'll be right with you\" just nothing. They all ignored me. After about 5 minutes, the cashier had finished and was able to help me.   I walked out of there disappointed.",

Does no one know what an over medium egg is? It is not runny! Back to the hash browns you can get the same thing at McDonald's, and the other potato thing they have isn't much better. Pancakes were tough and oddly a bit crispy? The sausage gravy, the sausage  isn't like any sausage I have tasted. Again not sure why the rating.",

The service was decent, we were seated immediately. The place was very busy, so I thought we were in for a winner. I had french toast and my Mom had biscuits and gravy. My french toast was less than mediocre - the bread was spongey.. My Mom's biscuits were absolutely awful, they tasted like they were made with some kind of chicken stock/boullion. The gravy was good. We let them know and they even said they were trying out a new recipe to replace the frozen biscuits they had been serving, but were having trouble perfecting it. They took it off the bill, which I was pleased about. I also felt like for what it was, they were extremely pricey. I've had better breakfast at Lenny's.",

We were all first timers at Egg Works 2, but my boyfriend and I had been to Egg & I before. We knew what to expect, and Egg Works 2 definitely delivered. Everyone enjoyed their dishes. I really enjoyed the Haole Moco, which is exaclty like a Loco Moco, but they use the house gravy instead. YUM! My boyfriend got the Avocado and Bacon Omlette with Potatoes. OMG I FORGOT HOW GOOD THE POTATOES ARE!!! A MUST TOO! My cousin got the Strawberry French Toast. It was a bit sweet, so ask for the strawberry sauce on the side. I would definitely recommend this place for big or small parties. It a bit off the strip, but worth the drive.",

The service has always been great, with special mention going to the happy egg / sad egg sign. The sign is cute, but what really deserves mentioning is the fact that if you flip this baby to sad egg, you will get help from whoever on the staff sees this. Any other place, and you are going to have to wait for YOUR server to come around....not so at Egg Works! I have been assisted by other servers, the manager, and even the hostess has stopped to help when they see that I am needing assistance. This is a huge plus for me. I love the team mentality.   The menu is huge. The variety of choices is amazing. I have yet to order the same thing twice, intent on broadening my horizons each time I visit. The burgers are good too, and yes, have one for breakfast!",

By PURE LUCK, we saw a sign for \"Egg Works\", stumbled in and discovered that it was the SAME COMPANY.   Here's all you need to know:  1. No wait on a holiday Monday. 2. I am an eggs benedict officianado, and theirs was MAGNIFICENT.  The eggs benedict was probably the best I've ever had, and the \"ranch-style\" potatoes that accompanied it were fantastic as well. 3. The prices were very reasonable.  100% Guaranteed that I will come back to this place next time I'm in Vegas (unless we opt for the sister establishment The Egg & I which was equally good).",

    "text": "[Review is solely for the awesome chili cheeseburger I chased down and captured here]:  When someone recommended Egg Works 2 as having one of the best cheeseburgers in town, I was dubious.  I mean, it's a breakfast place, right?  Who would ever order a burger when there are omelets and pancakes to be had?  But I went out on a limb and tried the Chili Cheeseburger that I was recommended.  Holy tastiness, Batman!  I almost licked the plate it was so good.  For those of you that haven't indulged in the sloppy mess that is the chili cheeseburger, let me tell you that the meal lives and dies on the quality of the chili.  Under the smothering tomato-meat sauce of a good chili, the burger patty becomes mere textural background.  But given the right chili--an amazing chili--that's not a bad thing.    And Egg Works 2 rightly deserves praise for its chili--which is cooked Cincinnati style.  Cincinnati chili is a little different than what you're probably used to.  It's made with some unusual ingredients (cinnamon, cloves, allspice or chocolate) and you won't find many chili peppers or chili powder in the sauce.  I was a little skeptical when I found out about the lack of chilies, but it's good, really good.  The Cincinnati-specific spices make the chili so much richer that you really don't miss the heat.  Order it with the works and you'll get gooey cheese and onions that make the burger a sloppy, brilliant mess.  The chili spills over the burger when you pick it up.  You'll need like 45 napkins.  But you won't care.    Man, it's a good burger.  I'd put it in the top 15 burgers in Vegas.  Why 15?  Well, I suspect there's nothing very interesting about the burger patty's taste under all that chili goodness.  But you won't even think of that while you're scooping every last bit of chili off the plate.",

Service with their lil egg you flip when you need something makes it convenient to get a servers attention. I will be back....oh they service alcohol as well. Always nice for a hangover",

    "text": "My favorite breakfast place ever! No questions asked.   Whoever thought of the concept of this place, from the decor to the food to everything else in the restaurant, is a bonafide genius! So thank you very very much.   Decor: This is an extremely family oriented restaurant. With a large dining hall with silly pictures that features eggs (example: egg-faced Mona Lisa), it's really inviting to people of all ages. The menu looks like a newspaper with cute little cartoons all over.   Service: I don't know if all the servers are required to have their morning coffee, but all of them are so perky! There's an black egg you can flip over to a yellow egg - this indicates that your table needs something. When this happens, any one of the Egg Works staff will come over and will ask what you need. What a great idea! This prevents from you staring awkwardly all over the restaurant for your server. Your server will bring your check over to your table but won't be your cashier. So after you're done with your meal, you have to go up to the front to pay. I don't mind this unless there's a huge line in the front at peak times. Then I get a little annoyed, but I guess I have to deal with it.  Food: YUM. Most of their dishes come with their \"Works\" potatoes. Perfectly cubed and perfectly seasoned! I can seriously have a plateful of just their potatoes. You can opt out of that for some fruit or cottage cheese. I've tried many of their dishes and was never disappointed. My favorites are listed below:   - Works Veggie Benny: Calling all vegetarians! An English muffin topped with fresh spinach, tomatoes, huge chunks of avocado, two poached eggs and drizzled in hollandaise sauce. This is my favorite item on their menu hands down.  - Vegetarian Crepe: Calling all vegetarians, again! A hefty serving of guac, mushrooms, spinach and Swiss cheese. The Works poppy seed dressing is tangy and sweet, the ultimate dipping sauce to this dish. ** I am NOT a vegetarian by no means, but the two above are DELICIOUS! **  - Greek Scramble: Chicken, mushrooms, artichoke hearts, spinach and feta cheese. OPA! in my mouth. For real.  -Blackened Prime Rib Benny: This is my boyfriend's favorite dish there. And I quote, \"What cow danced and left a mess in my mouth?!\". Prime rib lovers, this is for you.   Pro tip: Portions are huge here. For a lower price, you can get half portions for most of the items on the menu. So for those on a diet, you can still enjoy the succulent flavors of Egg Works!",

I wish there is a negative point system on Yelp.  I came here on a Monday with my husband as he loves breakfast. This little traditional looking diner looks promising. After we got seated and ordered water, our server did not come back until 10 minutes to take our order. We ordered 2 coffees, corn hash with English muffins,  and veggies skillet with English muffins.   To start of with coffee, our pot never came after 15 minutes and even the table next to us that came later got their coffee pot. We tried to wave down our server, she didn't even looked at us and said in a bad attitude that there were only three of them and please bare with me. We would've understand and be OK with the delay if it wasn't her attitude.   When our food arrived, they said will bring out my husband's English muffins in a bit. Of course,  it never came until we waved down our server 15 minutes later. She never came to check with us if the food were ok. It turns out, my husband's corn hash was too salty. She insisted my husband to order something else but at this point his appetite was ruined. She did bring out more English muffins to make up for it but it was kind of late.  My veggies skillet wasn't exactly in an iron skilet but a skillet shaped dish. I wish the menu had said something this dish is all raw veggies.  Other than potatoes on the bottom of the dish, the onions, bell peppers, mushrooms,  tomatoes,  and spinach were raw. I went light on cheese do everything was not cooked a bit. It was basic a salad with bedded potatoes and topped with bit of cheese and 2 eggs. I asked for over medium eggs but it came out over easy. I would at least want my onion and mushrooms cooked in some way.  When our bill came, we noticed the corn hash was taken off the check but added with \"a classic\". Then she explained to us the manager replaced the corn hash with the classic because the potato were eaten. When we pay our check at the front, the manager told my husband that she was under the impression the rest of eaten except the corn hash. She finally taken it off, and we left $0 tip.  It was one of the worse experiences I could have at an American restaurant.  I've never been to a place they take of the $11 food you didn't like but replace with a $8 dish that we did not had. They didn't have the most superb menu and I could have the same thing at a different place but with much better service. Never going back.  I really don't normally write such an extensive review but our experience here is way out of our expectations at a restaurant, in a horrible way.",

But, like any popular breakfast place, the waits can get long on weekends during high traffic times.  So, plan accordingly.  When the weather is nice, they have a patio with a few tables.  I usually get the breakfast burrito, which is very large and cooked on the flat top to give it a nice finish.  My wife gets the chicken enchilada or mashed potato omelet.  She always gets a half size, which is a great amount for her.  The potatoes are squared, fried, then covered in a fantastic seasoning, basically a seasoning salt, but it doesn't appear as salty to me.    The french toast stuffed with eggs, cheese, and your choice of meat is another dish we frequently order.  The scrambles are very good as well.  Clearly, we have eaten here a lot.  Once, I could bring myself to order a burger, and it was fantastic.  Large, juicy, and not overly cooked.  But, 99 times out of 100, I'm ordering breakfast at Egg Works.",

It didn't take long at all to get our food, give or take 15mins. It was absolutely amazing!!! I did go over my $20 Groupon voucher, however; it was still worth it to go over!! I will definitely have to stop by again when I'm in town!",

Corned beef hash was homemade and good, but it could've used more time in the pan to get the browned crispy bits. Potatoes were large chunks.  Their green hot sauce is really yummy.

It was no easy choice as their menu is full of a lot of dishes to choose from.   We settle on the chile relleno omelette (4 out of 5 stars as I would sub out the red sauce for a green sauce) and the Mexican omelette 4 stars as it had a little bit more onions than I'd like).   Overall it was very good food!! We'll be back to try the apple pecan pancakes!!!!",

    "text": "Came here w/ friends after the BADASS DASH. Starving and ready for some pancakes, a good sign of a great restaurant is a: full parking lot and a timely wait. We experienced both, what makes out better is that we're waiting to be seated and droves of people are still coming in to get a place in line.  Unfortunately we waited 45mins, I almost gave then a 3star rating for that alone but they redeemed themselves by giving our entire party of 9 muffins (free charge) before the even handed us our menus.  Service fast, customer service (GOOD) especially RACE DAY.  Egg Works got hit w/ a double dose of racers that day (BadAss Dash @ Southpoint and the COLOR RUN in henderson) and yes we all got in our cars for good pancakes.  I don't like to go against the grain when dealing w/ pancake establishments, I go for old faithful: FlapJacks, sausage and egg...hashbrown if i'm super hungry.  Food came to the table steaming hot.    BUTTERMILKE PANCAKES: nice and fluffy, kind of like an AIR fluffiness and BIG.  No sour after taste from the buttermilk, actually I could've ate the pancakes w/o the syrup.   Really though, who eats pancakes w/o syrup???? SHENANIGANS ok back to the air quality pancakes, the pancakes soak up the syrup UM YEA - DELICIOUS  EGGS and SAUSAGE: no big wow factor here, eggs NOT runny, good color, fluffy. (ok so i cannot stop using the word FLUFFY to describe this food) but the eggs WERE FLUFFY! ;-)  just a regular sausage pattie.  If I find myself on this side of town again around breakfast time, then I will definitely drop in for some PANCAKES.  FYI: NO SPLIT CHECK, if you're coming w/ a large group I suggest you come w/ CASH or designate that one CREDIT CARD person that will pay and then reimburse them.  TRY IT OUT, YOU'LL BE SURPRISED!",

The bread was lightly toasted, the hollandaise sauce was as it should be rich with a mild zest. The meat was savory but I found all of these ingredients together kind of washed each other out. Oh and my egg was poached perfectly. Next time I want to try their country Benedict.   My boyfriend had the beef style club burger and I can't speak to how it tastes but I was told it was also savory and nicely cooked.   Now on to our service.... Donna was our server and even though this place was packed she checked on us regularly. She was lovely, friendly and genuinely interested in making our first visit here a good one. Can't wait to come back again and try another of their breakfast masterpieces.",

    "text": "My fiance and I decided to visit this restaurant for Sunday Brunch. It was relatively busy at about 9:30 when we went, but the wait was only 15 minutes. They sat us and quickly got our drink orders. We went over the menu before we decided to order, and I decided I just wanted the classic - eggs and hashbrowns (I believe it also comes with a banana nut muffin or toast.) I noticed that adding meat on was an extra $2, so I decided not to get any. But, I was surprised when the waitress then took my order, and asked what kind of meat I wanted. I figured the menu was outdated because I didn't think the waitress would offer me meat that was $2 extra without telling me. My fiance got the stuffed french toast and a coffee.  The food came out and it was amazing! I think the classic says that it comes with two eggs any style, but I felt like I got waaay more than just two eggs. The banana nut muffin was to die for. The bacon, unfortunately, was overcooked and hard to eat. I took one bite and decided not to eat any more of it....that is until we got the check. I noticed that she had charged me for the bacon, which made me upset for two reasons 1) she didn't mention that it was extra and 2) it was completely inedible. (But after I realized 3 pieces of bacon cost me $2, I tried to eat as much as possible...never again.)  I guess maybe it's my fault for not correcting her or assuming she'd mention that it was extra. It was not a big enough mistake to stop me from coming back, it just put a little damper on my day, especially since the bacon was rock hard. Next time I'll just make sure to mention I don't want any sort of meat. Overall, the rest of the food was good and the service was quick.",

There's a decent sized sign off of the main road here as the front of the restaurant faces the parking lot and its shared but there are plenty of spots. Both times I was there, it was busy but we got a table right away. There is counter seating too where you can watch the food came out of the kitchen. There are booths and tables as well. Hostess greets you on the way in and gets you seated. Very nice and accomodating here. Waitresses got to us right away for drinks. The menus are unique here. They are set up like a newspaper. Pretty cool idea. I've only gotten breakfast here but they have soups and sandwiches as well. The lastest you can get a table is 3 pm, so its a breakfast and lunch spot only.  The food is delicious and the portions are huge. Ive gotten the muffin with my breakfast both times and that tastes great. Its warmed up as well. Corned Beef Hash is good here. Not sure if its homemade or not but it was good. The \"diablo\" style home fries as well.  I'll be back soon hopefully.",

    "text": "Prelims: a total dinner setting, with the rustic wooden tables and decor, the nice clean look, servers that race around to give you coffee or anything else you need, and a funky little device that if you flip to \"happy\", servers ignore you, but if you flip to \"need service\" multiple servers come racing from all directions to ask how they can help you. Service is great, above and beyond what most places do. And it's also very well known by the locals and very busy all the time, but that shouldn't stop you from visiting! Parking is very open and free, and the menu is a newspaper (very creative :) )  My wife ordered an omelet. I'm not a fan of omelet but when the wife wants eggs, well, a restaurant called \"Egg Works\" should fit the bill. The omelet was actually quite good - very fluffy, very well-stuffed, and accompanied by these delicious little packets of awesomeness called Diablo Potatoes. Essentially, the Diablo potatoes are little bundles of flavor that demons have salted with addictiveness so that you will always come back and feed on them. Just kidding - they're like home fries but with special house seasoning and perfectly roasted. I got a CA crepe, filled with mushrooms, avocados, bacon, swiss cheese. It was very good and enough to feed a small 3rd world country. I only ended up eating half because any more would mean that I would food coma for the rest of the week and I would very much like to be alive during my honeymoon,   All in all, it was very much worth the price, as we ended up sending just north of $20. So totally worth it for a nice brunch or breakfast.   TL;DR Eggs eggs eggs and delicious potatoes.",

We bee lined there yesterday (11/30/13), and here's what we found.  Usual fabulous service?  Check.   Usual tasty meals?  Check, check.  Usual fast, efficient and jovial staff?  Check.  Usual two-for-one coupon?  Check.  Manager Sherie and server Raul did a fine job, as is typical of all the staff at this location.  This place is The Gold Standard in the Egg & I franchise, and should be emulated by the entire franchise chain across the US.  NOTE:  The Egg & I in Webster, TX, is owned by a totally different franchisee, hence the vast difference in quality between the Houston locations and the Egg & I/Egg Works chain in Vegas.  This time I eschewed my usual Huevos Rancheros and chose the Taco Scramble, something I had never tried.  It was fabulous!  I ordered some warm flour tortillas on the side, slathered them with butter, and made a series of mini-burritos.  Yuuuummm!  I ended up bringing about half of the dish home (their portions are ample) for breakfast this morning.  Double Yuuummmm!  As we left the restaurant yesterday there was a line outside and we ended up chatting with a couple from out of town, on their first visit there.  We gave them one of our remaining two-for-one coupons to use, and wished them a fine day.  I knew they were in for a treat, and so will you be when you get there.  Dean Herrington",

My only real gripe is that no matter how we have asked for them my wife never seems to be able to get her eggs without being slightly runny. A small issue and not even close to causing us to pause in eating here.    Donna was our server on our recent trip, and she was very sweet, attentive, and quick to follow up on our requests.

This place is away from all the noise and crowed strip. The menu has something for every one. Trust me when I say everyone. In my party we had 3 picky vegetarians and they were very pleased with their choices. I also noticed some \"Latin/Hispanic\" choices that I will defiantly check out next time.   Also note that during football season this is a Chicago Bears joint. Very fun atmosphere. The service was impeccable. Friendly and fast without sacrificing taste and presentation.   If you need a quick break from the strip and need to gather your strength and consciousness back before you go back and do more damage then this is your place.",

The menu is just a dream and you can get breakfast or lunch, soups, chili all of it is really really good. Beyond that the service is exceptional they obviously go the extra yard to make sure everyone is well trained and very friendly to the customer.

U could tell that the corned beef was homemade and pulled right before cooking with the potatoes.   Tried the pancakes and waffles and they were amazing. I mean, in general, I don't think anyone can get pancakes and waffles wrong, right??!!??  Kids pancakes were cute because they made it into Mickey Mouse's face with a bacon smiley face =)  This is a place you wanna come with a large group so you can try a little bit of everything. And even then, I'm sure everyone will still have a large amount to finish eating.   This place was so yummy that I ate here 2 days in a row.",

That's okay, atleast my friend and I got there 40 min before they closed.  I ordered the Crazy chicken omelet, well something like that. It was alright. It didn't  stand out and the taste didn't amaze me.  Do you know what was amazing though? They had banana bread French toast. I have never seen that at a restaurant! I was pretty excited when my friend said we should share one. If you come here, I definitely recommend it. I love that banana bread isn't that sweet, but very flavorful.  The service was also very friendly. You know how girls get when they get brunch, it's never ending talking. Even though we were almost the only people in the restaurant we didn't feel rushed when we ate and caught up.",

I am a biscuit and gravy snob and let me tell you, the biscuit was light and fluffy and the sausage gravy had huge chunks of sausage in it. Not too expensive and the amount of food you get is pretty hefty. If you get a chance to eat at this place I would definitely try it out. Staff was pretty friendly and attentive.",

I sat and ordered a chicken fried steak and was soon joined by a couple to my right who placed their order a few minutes later. They received their food right away as another couple were seated to my left. They soon ordered and received their food. I asked our mutual server what the status of my meal was, and after checking, he came back laughing saying he forgot to put the order in to the kitchen. Naturally I didn't share his amusement and asked for the check for my coffee and muffin. Given the wait, I had lost my time to enjoy my breakfast, and didn't want to risk any further delays waiting for food that I would now have to wolf down. He was gracious enough to tell me there was no charge for the coffee and muffin.",

We arrived at around 10AM on a Friday and the place was pretty busy, but we were seated right away.   All of the staff was super friendly and welcoming. They were quick to get our drink order. Coffee tasted fresh and was good. We chose to sit on the patio, but it was a little noisy because of the planes literally flying right over the parking lot, so low you could practically look in the windows and wave to the passengers. We thought that was kind of fun, but it might be really annoying for some people.   Their menu is quite large, with many, many options. Any kind of egg dish you can imagine is available. I got the Veggie Benny and my husband got the Mexican-style burrito. (I can't remember exactly what it was called, but it has chorizo).   The food came out promptly and looked and smelled incredible! Everything was very fresh. My Veggie Benny had toasted english muffins, topped with grilled tomato slices, fresh sliced avocado, fresh spinach, topped with two perfectly poached eggs and a tasty sauce. I greatly enjoyed it. The potatoes served with it were really delicious, but a little over-seasoned.   My husband's burrito was large and the red sauce it was covered in looked like it was made fresh, not canned. He loved it.   We will definitely be back next time we are in Vegas!",

My mashed potato omelette was amazing - you know the food is good when everyone puts their phones away and it gets really quite.  Everyone ate every bite!! As always the banana muffins were delicious and their coffee is my favorite in all of Vegas! The food took a little too long to come out- but we knew how good it would be and didn't care.  Surprised when the waitress brought the check and had taken off $4 from our bill for the inconvenience? Great place - can't wait for our next trip to Vegas just for breakfast!!!",

Typical old school breakfast joint decor. Very crowded all the time. Service was friendly and fast. Portions are huge and filling.   Yelp Check in gets you a free Banana Nut Muffin.  Spinach Benny - $10.99 - Eggs were poached well. Yolk was runny and gooey. Typical benny with spinach for freshness. I got the hollandaise on the side. Our server gave me both to try, traditional and chipotle. I liked the chipotle since it had a nice kick to it. Comes with home style potatoes, cooked and seasoned well.   Breakfast Tostada - $11.50 - I got the chicken version with tomatillo salsa. The tostada is loaded with eggs, cheese, potatoes, and beans. Good for the first few bites but then the taste gets boring. Huge portion.   Banana Nut Muffin - $1.95 - Deep deep molasses flavor. Moist and tender muffin. Did not taste much banana flavor. And it did not have many pieces of nuts.",

The manager KJ I think  preceded to tell us he cut the floor so wasn't sure who was our server. He offered to take our order 25 minutes has now passed now a waitress Theresa finally shows up and takes our order loco Moco and s cold buffalo wrap. 1 o'clock she brings the loco Moco no wrap. She says it will be there in a bit. Returns with the wrap which is on the cold sand of the menu trying to bite into it the tortilla was as hard as a rock. Asked for the manager again he assured me the tortilla should have been soft not hard. the server returns to our table with my bill and says we got the family discount for  the inedible wrap. Menu price was 12.50 he gave me an 8.40 discount so I still ended up paying 4.00 for a crap sandwich  that the only part was edible was the inside.    Not the first time at this location. Crappy service for crappy food there are plenty of overpriced breakfast restaurants in Las Vegas no intention to ever go to this restaurant again the worst customer service and the food was even worse. See why the parking lot at 12:15 was empty. This was the sunset sunset location.",

    "text": "I visited Egg Works not too long ago with a large group, and the staff were accommodating, attentive, and friendly. The meal began with the banana nut muffins; the other reviews check out- the banana nut muffin is moist and delicious!   For my entree, I ordered the Benny with Spinach; a classic staple of your traditional millennial brunch. Let me start by saying the portions for everything, including the Spinach Benny, are pretty big; and as someone from California, these prices are more competitive than what we have there.  The English muffins were a bit soggy, due to an abundance of hollandaise, a lack of something to separate the hollandaise from the muffin, and what I believed to be a very lightly toasted muffin; however, these are all things that can be adjusted on request. It doesn't change a well poached egg, well-prepared hollandaise, and great portions for a reasonable price.  If you're in the area and on the hunt for a brunch place, give Egg Works a shot- I didn't regret it, and I don't think you will either!",

Which is fortunate for us because we came here every morning for breakfast while in Vegas. Yes it's that good.  Service wise we were always seated right away. Waiter was always attentive to us. The first time  we got there, our server noticed I was checking in on yelp and she got me the banana nut muffin with out me asking.  Food: They give a lot of food. Whatever I ordered I could never finish. I love that they have lighter options that you can sub out instead of potatoes.  Most of their breakfast meal come with toast or the banana nut muffin. GET THE MUFFFIN. Seriously, it's good. They bring it out nice a warm and you can put like a slice of butter and it will melt at make it ok so yummy. In all honesty though it doesn't even need the extra butter because it nice a smooth.  The first day I got one of their skillet dishes. It had spinach and chicken with eggs (preparers the way you like it), all over the diablo potatoes. I liked how the potatoes were seasoned. It had a nice kick of spice to it. But if your looking for more spice you can add more of their diablo sauce. I couldn't finish it because I was too full halfway through the meal.   Second day, I was really craving smoothing lighter do I got the breakfast parfait and a small stack of banana pancakes. Again it came with the muffin. This time the muffin was a bit of and edge like it was left in the oven just a tad bit longer, I'm one of those people who fight the the edge piece in brownies-it gave it the little extra bit of texture that I love. I guess I didn't learn from the first time, they came with huge portions. The parfait had mandarin oranges, strawberries, blueberries, and bananas layer in between the granola and yogurt. Banana pancakes was loaded with bananas. It was sweet enough so no need for syrup.  By the third day I was craving some local Hawai'i food. And lo and behold they have some Hawai'i favorites. I saw the loco moco but I really wanted some country gravy. No problem they have a play on the loco moco called the Haole Moco. It was yummy. By far my favorite breakfast item. The country gravy really went well with the hamburger. The mushrooms  also added to the flavor. Makes me wish we have the haole moco back Home.  One take away, come hungry because you will leave stuffed.",

The place was busy so if the host gave your spot to another party who arrived much later you would be upset as well. In addition, our waitress got our side order wrong. We ordered ham on the side of our meal and received bacon. She then made me switch out the bacon for the ham and made me put the bacon on a separate plate. Which I think she ended up giving those bacon strips to another customer....which is not okay. The ham we received was dry and the eggs were dry and unappetizing.

This location is so close to my childhood home, every time I'm in town, I come to eat here. I absolutely love this place!  Today was just another 5 star experience. Amy helped us at the counter and was seriously one of the best servers I've ever had. She knew based off my hesitation between potatoes and fruit, that MAYBE I might want half and half! And guess what? I DID! She was very nice and friendly, kept our water glasses filled and sitting at the counter couldn't have been any better.  I got my usual, the breakfast burrito (traditional one) and my husband got Brad's scramble. He was a huge fan of it because it had mushrooms in it and he wasn't aware it would come like that, but oh well! The toast was great! My breakfast burrito was beautiful made and that Diablo sauce really just tied everything together.  The woman next to me got this beautiful French toast option, if I wasn't trying to watch my weight, I would have easily ran off with her French toast.  Can't wait to eat here again, wish these were in LA! So happy they've become successful in Vegas. :)",

Since I was alone, the hostess suggested one of the open spots at the counter.  I took a seat between a friendly couple and the unfriendly reincarnation of Jimmy Durante.  The menu was overwhelming - which was a good thing since I was pretty hungry.  My server was quite nice, and didn't seem at all rushed in spite of how busy it was (in fact, all the employees seemed to be in a really good mood despite the crowds).  I ordered a coffee and the loco moco.  Both were very good.  I've had loco moco in Hawaii many many times, and this version was every bit as good.  The rice and patty were cooked perfectly, and the gravy was flavorful without being overpowering (they also provided extra on the side).  I consider myself something of a breakfast/diner snob, and I really liked Egg Works.  I won't be a full-time Vegas resident for a few more weeks, but I look forward to making this place a regular breakfast hangout once I get there.",

We had a few minor problems on our last few visits and decided to, as politely as we could, mention them to the manager. We spoke to two managers who were both excellent listeners and genuinely interested in our input. They both offered, pretty much demanded, to pay our bill and gave us a loaf of their delicious banana bread to go. It was a very pleasant conversation and was refreshing to hear both managers genuinely concerned about us having a great experience there and we will continue to make Egg Works one of our favorite \"go to\" breakfast spots.",

The unfortunate part for me is the management.  I work for Pahrump Honey Company and of course wear a shirt with the company name and drive a car with the company name on it, but in the morning usually have NO honey products in the truck!  Between my husband and I and ALL of the community work we do, we know a lot of people in the Vegas area and tend to run into them out, especially at a popular breakfast spot.  Because of these things I have been accused several times now of soliciting inside the restaurant even while I was asked to join the city council meeting on health for the Vegas valley by a council member and to talk to the people!  Today there were 3 gentleman that had flown in from out of town who started talking to us because of the honey.  They called pver and asked at one point if we thought it better to rent a car or use uber.  We ended up taking them to rent their car after their meal because that is what you do for people, but before we could all leave we were asked by the manager to stop harassing these gentleman and to stop soliciting.  The gentleman were more than happy for a ride seeing as they would have had to walk and I have absolutely NO PRODUCTS in my truck so how could I solicit anything.  I just want a nice place to have breakfast every morning before I start my day.",

I remembered seeing this place on my drive home one day and decided we should give it a try. The parking lot was packed, so we were afraid there would be a long wait. To our surprise, we got seated right away. That was a plus since we were all starving.  My friend ordered the corned beef hash and it was amazing! It was different from any other corned beef hash I have ever had. My favorite for sure. My mom ordered the fruit plate, which was huge! They serve it with either cottage cheese or yogurt. It looked amazing and the fruit was very fresh. The only thing I would have changed would have been the portion of cottage cheese. It just wasn't enough for the amount of fruit. I ordered a bacon avocado egg white omelet. It was amazing. Plenty of avocado, which I love. I would highly recommend it.     All in all, this was a great meal. My mom keeps asking when we're going back!",

That's an eggs benedict, but with prime freaking rib instead of ham and a croissant instead of an english muffin.  Yeah, the french do breakfast bread better than the Brits.  Compare that to a trough of scrambled \"eggs\" at circus circus.  Yeah, you won't get your three plates of bacon, but maybe that's a good thing.  They give you potatoes too, so that should be enough calories to work off your hangover.  Plus you get off the strip- that place has taken enough of your money.

    "text": "First off, I wouldn't consider myself the least bit an early-riser (well, not for breakfast anyways).  I was here at 6:30 in the morn, lacking sleep, and I am still able to recall the killer breakfast at this place.  I honestly didn't even know this Egg Works had a location on Sunset (even though it has been there forever), but I'm glad I stopped in.  I needed to make a stop to the airport and breakfast prior to doing so just seemed like a good idea. I'll probably never see this place that early in the morning again though.  So being 6:30 in the am, I figured the place would be desolate, but I was taken by surprise when I entered and saw 3 other parties grubbing on some Egg Works offerings.  Okay, 3 parties isn't much, but seriously... it's 6:30!  That was a good indicator that this place means business.  After people-watching while waiting for my juice to be freshly squeezed from their orange tree that is growing within the walls of their kitchen (seriously it took a minute, but maybe I'm just not as patient during this hour), i noticed that the 3 other parties were regulars.  Regulars equals good service!    Our waitress was very helpful and even made mention of her picks on the menu.  I ended up going with the Haole Moco, which is an Americanized version of the ever-so-popular Hawaiian Loco Moco. Nice!  Pros: * good portion sizes... I even had to take some to go * okay so no Orange Tree in the kitchen to my knowledge, but it was fresh * open early for you early-risers (or late sleepers). * good service  Cons: * service can be a bit slow at times due to small talk w/ regulars  Tips:   They have this little flippy-thing that doubles as a salt/pepper shaker holder.  You can flip over to a different color, which indicates to the waitress that you are in need of assistance.  Pretty nifty.  I'll be honest, I just stared at it for a good minute or two, but since there were obstructions and I was entering the beginning stages of my food-coma, I said forget it and just waited for an opportunity to make eye-contact with the waitress to get the bill.  Seems pretty cool though. I'll try it next time I go and let you know if the waitress actually sees it in a timely manner.    One more tip, look up and watch the news.  It's more informative than people-watching, but I can't say it's more fun.",

Our friend in California told us that going to this restaurant is a must--the food selection is phenomenal and the quality of the food superb.  What added to the pleasant experience was a waitress named Chelsea who was extremely pleasant, helpful, and efficient.  What I thought was a quaint touch was the way you can make known you need to speak to your waiter/waitress.  There is a yellow tag next to your table.  Under that tag is another tag with a different color (black).  When you flip the yellow tag so the black is showing, your waiter/waitress knows that you want their attention avoiding the need to shout out their name or trip them as they walk by.  When we return to LV in the future, Egg Works is on our list to go for a great meal and wonderful service.",

First, we were incessantly hounded to have our order taken, asked at least 3 separate times in under 5 minutes...and every time they asked my kids were in the bathroom and hadn't even been to the table yet or seen a menu. We definitely felt rushed. Next, I ordered eggs benedict and when it was served the eggs were raw! As in when I cut in to them the whites oozed out like snot, which is disgusting. However the third and final offense came when I flipped my egg over to yellow for service and when I requested some cooked eggs, the waitress proceeded to explain to me that if I wanted my eggs cooked hard I should have ordered them that way. What?! So I said that all I wanted was for them to be poached until the whites were actually cooked...2 more servers asked what the problem was, again alluding to having them cooked over medium or hard. I gave up, asked them to just take my plate and sipped on my coffee while my family ate their food. I most certainly won't patronize this establishment nor recommend it to anyone I know. Shame on you Egg Works staff for bullying and speaking condescendingly towards your customers. We came in for a leisurely breakfast on a Wednesday morning, it's wasn't a packed Saturday brunch rush...you should let your patrons enjoy their experience!",

    "text": "First, let me say that this place was very crowded for a Monday. We are visiting from out of town and thought \"Great! It must be good.\" The restaurant itself was freezing cold. And it never changed, temperature wise. They had two hostess' and the one we dealt with first didn't take or name because she said \"your first, I've got you in my mind.\" Ok, sounds good.. it wasn't. She left and the other one returned and seated new people before us. The old one came back and was like \"OMG, I'm so sorry, your next.\" Then the second one came back and seated someone else again!!! We finally got seated and all was ok. The food was ok. Not great, not bad EXCEPT for the pancakes, which were hard. Yuck. Now it's time to pay. We stood in line and in front of us was a man with a Chihuahua on a leash. Yes, inside the restaurant. He had been sitting near us and was there when we got there, finished, but just sitting on his phone. The dog was terrified, and freezing too. Anyhow, at the cash register this man was yanking and pulling the dog.. I said she looks very afraid. He says yes, she's overwhelmed. My husband leans down and let's her sniff his hand and then she practically jumps into his arms. He gives her a little scratch on her back and the man turns around and says Don't pet her, she's a service dog. We said ok. Then he got belligerant with us and said I've got the papers if you don't believe me!!! Then the cashier pipes in, and says you should never pet a dog unless you ask first! I then say, we own a pet sitting business, we are familiar with animals and the guy got even more rude. The whole situation was ridiculous. The dog did not have a service vest and was clearly not a service animal. Poor pup. We felt sorry for her. My issue is with the cashier, Lacey. She had no business giving her opinion or intervening. She was VERY rude and then became very condescerning when I complained about her behavior. So, if your looking for a good meal with a pleasant experience GO SOMEWHERE ELSE. FYI, It's not an inexpensive place either. One star because you can't give zero.",

Also we were definitely those annoying people that stayed for a really long time and no one gave us a hard time about it, which we really appreciated since we had a lot to catch up on. All in all I'd definitely recommend this place for breakfast.",

Is it so hard to get a fresh salad here in Henderson?  My lettuce was wilted, turning pink at the edges and had some brown spots. I asked them to take it back and the waitress kindly brought me more muffins on the house.   Why would an establishment ever serve salads that obviously are closer to rotting than being fresh.   Henderson, I give up on ordering salads from any of your restaurants. And Egg works, you're on my list of restaurants who rather plate any kind of food than plate quality ingredients and cross fingers that I'll just stuff my face without looking.   5 stars for the muffins though. I'll come back for those and when I'm hungry for breakfast food.   Skip the salad. Who eats that for breakfast anyways ;)",

I usually opt for the classic with over medium eggs, toast, and fruit. If you want to splurge, I highly suggest the chili relleno omelet.   Everything on the menu is great unless you catch them on a bad day. Today for instance, my over medium eggs were a runny, watery, mess.

I made that mistake and mine were too salty. The chicken fried steak was good crispy every country gravy was awesome. I opted not to get toast but get their house banana nut muffin. Oh my gosh the muffin was excellent. As for my scrambled eggs to be scramble dry and not runny and they were really well done, almost too browned. Service was ok, she was very friendly and told us how to use the little happy and sad egg faces on the condiment stand to alert her if we needed anything. I would go back again and try an omelette.",

Whenever I'm in the mood for breakfast again I'll have to pay them another visit. Bottom line, I'll be back.",

We told our server it was our first time and she gave us banana muffins on the house. It's quite clever for them to offer it because once you take a bite, you'll be hooked. There were lots of breakfast and brunch options on the menu and our server helped make some recommendations. We ended getting omelets which were delicious and super filling (made with 4 large eggs). The three pigs omelet was stuffed with ham, bacon, and sausage. It was very savory and would recommend if you like meaty omelets. The portions are very generous and our omelets were probably at least an inch thick! The Habla Diablo seasoned potatoes were also crispy and tasty. Love the chill diner atmosphere here. Eggcellent quality food and service for an affordable price!",

    "text": "Been here before and liked it. After catching the red eye flight we were hungry. Always consistent in excellent service and quality food.   What caught my eye was they have loco moco . Then I noticed there was a haole moco. Found that sooooo funny. The difference is the loco moco comes with brown gravy and the haole moco comes with country gravy (white gravy). I think real loco moco has to come with brown gravy.   Got mine done medium/well with the egg over easy. Described as coming with sticky rice, which is standard rice where I come from.   Comes with a choice of toast or banana nut muffin. Get the muffin, it's da bes. Shows up warm and when you butter it, oooo broke da mout.   The California crepe was good too and a good portion. The Works parfait was full of fruit and looked good.   Our server, Kathleen, was very nice and friendly. She was soooo attentive and always checked on us to see if all was okay and to refill water and coffee. We never got to use the yellow egg. If you come here you'll know about the yellow egg and the black egg.   So, overall all, excellent rating of 5 stars due to the excellent service when we were greeted upon arrival and seated. Kathleen was great and she is an asset to this establishment.   We will return when we are in the area next time. We got a banana nut muffin when we checked in, another plus for Egg Works on Sunset Road.",

I have not had lunch here yet but from the looks  of others meals it looks just as good as breakfast. Staff is always friendly and fast and they always make sure our food top notch!

Ended up sitting on the patio because there was no wait for that. It was good sitting out there as it was a bit too warm inside the restaurant. This place is right at the end of the runway of the Vegas airport so you do get to take in the planes landing if you sit outside. Had a basic ham and cheese omelet. Pretty good. Lots of potatoes and could not even finish them all.  Service was good as well.",

This time I tried Grandma's Biscuits and Gravy and my husband had the Bacon and Sliced Avocado Omelette.  I was disappointed again.  The biscuits weren't that good and the gravy had a strange taste to it.  My husband said the omelette wasn't bad.  The servers were friendly but the service itself was just okay.

Looking at the long and impressive list of choices I selected a hard to find item, Corn Beef Hash topped with 2 Eggs Sunnyside,  coffee and Rye toast from the friendly and  courteous SHANTEl, who brought me a carafe or coffee real cream and water.  The impressively quick service bought forth a large plate of Corn Beef Hash  that was delicious.

Had to look and ask around just to get a to go container. Issue checking out for the free banana muffin per Yelp check in as well. The muffin was good and the breakfast burrito was pretty decent. I'm unsure I would return after the service and the lack of cleanliness.",

I had the stuffed French Toast for the first time and it was amazing. Jim had the Denver omelette which is a good standard. The banana nut muffins we took to go for later and they are wonderful. Chelsea was our server and gave us impeccable service.  We love that you get a coffee pot when you order coffee so doesn't run out plus l love to use the flavored coffee creamers a real treat with all the flavor's they offer. All in all a wonderful breakfast experience!!!!",

She was fast to greet us just as we were seated and take care of our drink order. She gave us enough time to know just what we wanted before she came back to get the order.    The plain waffle and ham was perfect with added blueberries on the side.  The Sundance omelette is my goto at any Egg Works and is hard for me NOT to order.  I change it up from the  on menu item by making it with egg whites and adding garlic/extra garlic to it. If you love garlic then it is well worth it to ask them for it with this omelette. It really adds great flavor.  Today I also added avocado and it was so good that I think I will probably keep adding it.    Coffee is always good here and if it's not on the table do not forget to ask the server for the flavored ones for a bonus treat.",

While that was all good and fine, the reason we went there was to eat something delicious, and that was not the case. The food wan either delicious nor horrible.. My bacon and avocado omelet was super salty and had a weird taste which reminded me of a dirty grill. The country potatoes were the size of petite green peas and were a pain to eat. The pancakes were small and didn't taste like anything. The island platter was entertaining, because other than a chunk of pineapple, there was nothing island about it. Steamed white rice....not islandy or delicious at all. The Benedict was well prepared, but again nothing popped out in terms of flavor.  We really wanted this place to be way better and add it to our list of top breakfast places, but that didn't happen. There are lots more places to grab breakfast locally, and we are going to pass on this and keep looking.",

The boyfriend got a \"4 way\" Cincinnati Chili while I had a Hawaiian platter breakfast (2 eggs, sunny side up, Portuguese sausage, 2 scoops of rice, 2 slices of toast, and 1 slice of pineapple). We shared everything - and we also had some spam.  Service was a little slow, but this place seems to get packed rather quickly, so if you go before  9:30AM, it might be a little better. When we got there, there weren't a ton of people, but by the time we sat down and ordered, the crowd started to pour in.  They have a \"paging\" system much like that of Bubba Gump or other restaurants. Black side of the egg has a happy face on it, denoting that you're OK and do not need assistance. The yellow sad face catches the waiter/waitress' attention and they stop to help you with whatever you may need. Waitresses were very courteous, however, down to the point. Who can blame them though? It got rather busy quickly. No small talk or anything like that, just straight to the point. Not a bad thing, just an observation of what I noticed.   Cincinnati chili, as my boyfriend described it, was \"not Skyline, but can pass as Cincinnati chili. More like Dixie chili.\" Not as watery as Skyline, a bit more flavorful in my opinion (more spices in it). Not as cheesy as Skyline though.  The Hawaiian breakfast platter of course, was good. Well, to be fair, it really is hard to mess up on sunny side up eggs so I'll skip that. They tasted like eggs. The sour dough toast, well, it was sour dough toast - so I'll skip that as well. Not sure what else to write about since everything else on that plate tasted as it should have. I've never quite had an \"exceptional\" quality Hawaiian breakfast, so... The spam was just spam that was pan fried, no teriyaki sauce marinade. I guess the fact that it tastes like what it's supposed to and looks the way it is supposed to is a plus though. Food tasting like anything other than what it is sometimes odd and could be a bad thing.   I did not get a chance to have their omelets or egg crepes, but I will definitely be back to try again another time. A nice little gem a bit off of the strip. They also have several locations in Vegas area as well.",

After a quick Yelp search we realized that Egg Works 2 was just around the corner from McCarran Airport.  We forgot that it was Saturday morning, so the place was sort of busy.  We decided to sit at the counter since there were seats open.  Service was prompt and our order was prepared in no time. The menu is extensive, which made it difficult to make a decision.  My buddy ordered some sort of skillet which he really enjoyed.  I went with a bacon, egg and cheese on a Ciabatta roll with home fries.    Can't beat a really tasty breakfast, served quickly at a good price.  Would go here again if I'm looking to get some AM grub while in Vegas.",

I ordered the Santa Cruz skillet which had potatoes, chicken, chorizo, and a special \"Santa Cruz sauce.\" Took one bite all I could taste was salt and a packet of taco seasoning. I would have never ordered something with those flavors but their lack of description duped me. The chorizo was ground too finely and the chicken was lunch meat cut into squares. Also, the potatoes were strange squares that were not at all fresh. The Yelp reviews are extremely inflated due to what was written at the bottom of the receipt about servers winning a trip to Disneyland if they get the most positive reviews. The servers were great and the manager was even on the floor, but they need new cooks. Avoid if you want a good breakfast.",

The shell itself was pretty big. I was hesitant to tell the server because I hate complaining but my group insisted that I did. She was super wonderful about it. She comped my meal and gave me a free muffin (it was DELICIOUS). Unfortunately, I did get sick shortly after breakfast. I feel like the sickness was more of a result of my sensitive stomach than anything the restaurant did. I would have given 5 stars for service and food quality. I deducted a star for the shell and getting sick afterwards. I'd totally try it again though!",

The service was pretty awful, we has to ask for a coffee refill 3 times from our first cup. Then we had to ask for creamer 3 different times and sugar 3 different times. And all from different waiters. Ok fine, the food should be awesome. Let's stick it out.  No. It wasn't fine. It was maybe mediocre at best. I got a veggie skillet that required me to dig through the lukewarm eggs and quagulated cheese to find. Don't boast of a \"totally loaded veggie skillet!!!\" that had two mushrooms in it, a bit of tomatoes, no onions, and a few skimpy bell peppers. Worst ever. Did I mention the cold, sorta melted cheese that stuck together like glue? Ugh.  Then I needed more coffee and knew it was time to go.  I will not be going back, nor should you.  I'm not gonna go back to my regular place and beg for forgiveness.",

We went Saturday and the place was packed but we were seated within 10 minutes.  The waiter arrived promptly and took our drink orders.  The food took a long time to come from the kitchen but as I said it was packed.  I was impressed with how they kept the tables cleared and kept seating the customers.  The menu looks like a newspaper and reads a bit like one too.  A lot of selections including breakfast and lunch items.  We all decided to have breakfast.  I'm not a big eater and was going to simply have one egg with toast and was happy to see it on the menu; however, at almost $9.00 like wow!  So I decided for a few more dollars to go ahead and pig out, sigh.  I had the waffle with fruit, bacon and 2 eggs.  It was tasty but nothing spectacular.  My husband had the porkchops which he wasn't impressed with.  Our son had some kind of egg burrito which had too many green peppers that were raw.  They were very accomodating to remake it without the peppers which was nice.  He enjoyed it finally.  The restaurant and the restrooms were very clean.  The staff was hustling and doing a good job.  I probably won't go back because the prices were very high for the quality of food that you got.  The serving sizes were adequate.  I just can't get over the prices for food that isn't anything to brag about.",

Service was very good, very friendly. This was surprising seeing how busy our server must have been. The place was packed with a line, though we were seated very quickly. Food is typical huge American-style breakfasts. The massive omelets, waffles, pancakes, etc. Wish I had taken a picture of the pancakes as they were literally bigger than the dinner plate. HUGE.   TIP: If you want pancakes (like I did), but want a normal portion, just order the one pancake side order. The short stack has THREE massive pancakes that are impossible to eat.   Also, heads up to dairy-free people: they serve both buckwheat and wheat pancakes which are dairy-free and taste (the wheat does) just like the real thing. Delicious!",

Service was fairly quick, they were obv trying to turnover as many tables as possible, but we didn't feel rushed  The food was good. I order the sunrise mountain (open croissant with eggs, sausage and cheese on top), lady got the waffles and her friend got the French toast.   The girls liked tier meals although the waffles were a bit too doughy. every special requests tended to, sizeable portions.   The sunrise mountain was pretty good,  generous portion. It was served in a cast iron dish with the croissant covering the bottom and the eggs, sausage, and cheese melted over the top. It was pretty heavy and there was a lot of cheese on it and I will probably ask for less next time.  All in all, food was good and service was fair. Will have to go back and try some other dishes and not during a crazy busy time.",

They put their benedict in a broiling dish and smother it in holladasie sauce. They top it with a little caynee pepper and put it under the broiler for a minute or two. It also comes with a huge side of cajun style home fries. Absolutely amazing.   The service is spot on. Friendly smiles and great attitudes. If you don't like something, you simply flip your egg over on your table (it's part of the menu holder) and they come fast as can be. Always someone running around with coffee so your cup never goes empty. It's what all breakfast place should be!   When in Vegas, avoid the hotel buffet and come here. It's awesome! You won't leave disappointed. Just make sure to get here early on the weekends. It can be a little busy...",

    "text": "A good, solid breakfast joint (and lunch if you're feeling that kind of way) that's perpetually busy and now I know why.  My husband and I had a rare weekday off together and we decided to try this place out (finally!). It was a Thursday around 10am and while we didn't have to wait for a table, it was surprisingly busy. We were sat at a small table just off the bar area and our server, Austin, was outstanding. My husband told him it was our first time there and asked for suggestions and he immediately whizzed off to get us some complimentary banana muffins. Heaven in a muffin tin, people! And that damn butter! Grassland Dairy, where are you? Where can I find your butter for sale? So freaking good! I'll say it again-so. freaking. good. I need you Grassland butter!  My husband opted for a breakfast skillet and I had the spinach eggs Benedict. Husband was super happy and his skillet was HUGE and had everything he wanted. Potatoes (more on those later but mmmmmm!), eggs, ham, tomatoes, onions, mushrooms and cheese (and really, I may be missing a few items cause there was just SO much packed into that thing!). It came with a side of toast and again, that BUTTER!  My spinach eggs Benedict was...well, it was ok. The eggs were poached perfectly and the English muffins didn't get soggy, which is almost impossible with a bennie so mad props for that. I did take issue, however, with a couple of the main parts of the it. The ham was way too salty for my liking and the hollandaise sauce was, well, just ok.  It's not that it was bad, just kind of bland. The potatoes, however, were to die for. Chopped up into bite sized pieces and lightly seasoned. No need for ketchup or any dipping sauce with these spuds-they stood up deliciously by themselves. The orange juice (which they say is fresh squeezed) cost a mint. $2.95 a glass with no refills. Save some dough and forgo the OJ in place of something less expensive.  The service was second to none. We were greeted and seated immediately. Our server was incredibly friendly and easy going. Our order was taken quickly and accurately and despite the restaurant being busy our meals came out pretty quickly.  I recommend Eggworks to everyone at least once! It's easy to see why they're approaching a cult following status.",

There was 3 of us and the wait was a little over 30 minutes (it was also a busy Friday morning). Prices are medium priced but portions are big (to me they were) so you'll get your moneys worth.   Food was awesome, delicious and at the same time so simple! Something we needed after a 5 hour flight from Hawaii. We ordered the waffle works (Belgium waffle, scrambled eggs, and choice of meat), loco moco (popular dish from Hawaii with steamed rice, hamburger patty, smothered in gravy and topped with eggs), and oatmeal w/ bowl of fruit and side of toast and avocado.   Service was great! Despite that day being super busy, our waitress kept everything in top notch!    I definitely recommend locals or tourist to come here. I know I will be back soon!",

Being a homemade corn beef fan, I opted for this entree and when it arrived the size was overwhelming large like most of the entrees here. The corn beef was unfortunately overly salty and inedible so I only ate part of my scrambled eggs. When the waitress came by to check on us, I mentioned how bad my corn beef was and she asked if I wanted anything else which I declined. When our waitress returned she advised me she advised the chef and removed my entree from the bill which was a nice gesture. Everybody else in our party seemed to be happy with their food.  I won't let this negative experience keep me away from Egg Works - hopefully the next experience will be better.",

It is the best one that I have ever tasted in my 34 years of existence. I can't wait to be back here on my next visit to Vegas. And this time, I will order these goodies to go. Our server was excellent as he kept checking up on us. Unlike other restaurants where the only time you'll see your server is when you order and when you have to pay.

I'm soo indecisive when it comes to picking food that it took me a good while to figure out what I wanted.  I ended up getting the Country Style Eggs Benedict. It comes with 2 biscuits, sausage patty, smothered with country gravy, and topped with 2 eggs cooked to your liking and a side of Works potatoes, a slice of grapefruit and pineapple.  - the country gravy was a little too salty for my taste, so I didn't enjoy it as much as I wanted to. The potatoes were cooked perfectly, nice and crispy with a touch of paprika.   I also got to try the Stuffed French Toast. This was AHH-MAYZING! Gooey cheese, egg, and sausage sandwiched between two pieces of French toast. Drizzle the maple syrup on top, and voila! Thee perfect breakfast! It also comes with a side of Works potatoes. I'll be back for this next time.   *Coffee is all you can drink! And if you don't like non dairy creamer, you can ask for half & half :)",

One of them is allergic to all milk products and let the waitress know this. However, when his food came, there was butter on the toast. The butter side was face-down, and he bit into it unknowingly. He had a small allergic reaction as a result.   They then asked my boyfriend to give them their tip out loud, something I've never heard of being done at any other restaurant. I thought that was unusual.  Overall, I wasn't happy and will be sticking to their other locations in the future.",

We were greeted right away by Robert who was great to us. He was super friendly and very attentive which made our first time here an enjoyable one.   We ordered two banana nut muffins (SAVE YOUR MUFFIN BECAUSE IF YOU EAT IT, YOU'LL BE TOO FULL FOR YOUR MAIN MEAL). The banana nut muffin was moist, but I would have preferred more nuts in mine. But it went very well with coffee. Btw, if you order coffee, they give you a whole container of it along with different flavored cream  (If requested). I saw some French vanilla, Irish cream and caramel.   We also got the strawberry cream cheese French toast, which I thought would be a stuffed French toast but it was more of strawberry cream cheese sandwiched between two pieces of bread with some strawberry jam/puree on top. It was too sweet for me so I didn't add any syrup. Nothing special, so I won't be ordering it again. Maybe if they changed the bread to a baguette it would be a lot better!  I was too full to try my sisters chili cheese omelette but the leftovers were really good! The omelette was just eggs and onions with chili in between and some cheese melted on top & sour cream. And they don't skimp out on the meat like most places. It came with their seasoned potatoes which were still nice and crispy after being refrigerated and your choice of toast or banana nut muffin. We got the white toast and they butter it for you.  After your meal you can pay in the front at the cashier near the entrance.   Really great service and food at reasonable prices so I'll definitely be back!",

Sometimes I go with the breakfast tostada which is a giant flour tortilla baked into the shape of a bowl the filled with beans their signature potatoes scrambled eggs and taco meat topped with tons of cheese salsa and sour cream f**k that's delicious. I've tried everything from their Hawaiian favorites like Loco moco to the French Toast and nothing has ever failed me... and don't forget about the banana muffin so good all warm with butter running down it...

The breakfast potatoes are absolutely amazing, they have a crispiness to them and the flavor is delicious. We have never had a bad meal here, nor have we ever had bad service at any location! During this visit I had the cheese & cheese omelette. Amazing & so much cheesy goodness! My husband had the ciabatta breakfast sandwich, it was HUGE & looked delicious! That's one I will definitely have to try in the future! Our waitress during this trip was Donna. She was great. Not only was she rapid taking our drink order & food order, she was extremely attentive checking back with us multiple times to be sure that all was going well. After working as a waitress for many years myself, it was great to see someone who loved her job as much as Donna!",

    "text": "I am a glutton by nature and the way that Egg Works II does breakfast only fuels my sinful constitution. The week before my birthday, I tend to go on a strict diet in preparation for the voracious appetite to come. Out of the blue, the craving for Eggs Benedict manifested, so I succumbed. It was the first time in five years that I have even thought about ordering this dish, so I did my research to find a combination that would best suit my personality.   Egg Works happens to have the veggie works benny with grilled tomatoes, spinach, avocado, and two poached eggs smothered in hollandaise sauce. I almost got this, until I saw the blackened prime rib served on a grilled croissant with sauteed spinach, bell peppers, and eggs covered in the same decadently rich dressing. I could not resist and why should I? The  huge portion was served in a skillet with a a few slices of fresh fruit and home fries. The potatoes are well seasoned and crisp. I started by saying I would only eat half of them and soon the whole side was gone. The eggs benny was delicious, but not without some minor issues. The hollandaise is plentiful and salty, ask for it on the side. The prime rib was cooked to well done and on the tough side. What it has going for it outweighs my complaints. The soft, airy croissant gives a texture that is not often associated with this dish, and I appreciated that. The eggs were poached to perfection. With one swift slash of my fork, the center burst out with all the fatty goodness of the yolk. The paprika on top, cut through the dense creaminess of the sauce.   With my craving subdued, I can go another five years without it and a day without eating. It will take a few hours in the gym to work off this meal, but there is no remorse or regret with this decision.",

    "text": "My review of yesterday's breakfast comes with bias because we eat here all the time for breakfast.  But this is my first review.  We usually stick to our favorite dishes and don't deviate too often.  When the dish is always good, no need to change.  I always get the bacon, avocado omelet in the small portion (a bit cheaper but you have to ask for it).  My husband always gets the fiesta skillet with chorizo, no eggs.  This comes in a half-size too for reduced calories and price.  The banana nut muffin is the best!  Forget toast, you want the muffin!  We use coupons a lot here which is a nice feature for locals.  The breakfast potatoes are seasoned with their special flavor.  I wish they had home style hash browns, but they don't.  All in all, we always return and we always leave happy.  Oh yeah, and they leave the coffee carafe on your table for unlimited never-need-a server access!!",
