They are really slow and take their sweet ol time to greet you at your table and when they do finally show up they have attitude. this isn't just a one time visit.. We've given them multiple chances to prove us wrong but it's the same thing everytime! We love our sushi but not enough to deal with their awful service! We will bringing our service else where!",

    "text": "When it comes to \"all you can eat\" sushi, Goyemon has to be one of the best here in Vegas.   Their AYCE menu is pretty extensive which includes a lot of variety. Like most places they say you have a one hour time limit but the waiter was always around if we wanted to order more and believe me we ordered enough to feed a family of four and it was only two of us.   First thing on the menu that caught my eye was pork belly. I know most of my reviews mention pork but c'mon \"ALL YOU CAN EAT PORK BELLY\" I was like a kid in a candy store. The pork is braised to perfect tenderness and lightly grilled for that chard flavor. Another thing that was unique was their Spicy Tuna Fire Cracker. The crunchy texture of the rice and soft spicy tuna tantalizes your taste buds. I tend to order most of the Nigiri sushi and the quality of their fish and seafood is tops!   The only thing I would say was \"so so\" was their deserts with the exception of their lychee sorbet. But its OK by this time I was comatose from all that sushi goodness.   I would have to say Goyemon has set the bar pretty high for me when it comes to AYCE sushi.",

My only issue was our waitress disappeared around time for dessert so we had to ask another server to send her over.

    "text": "Yelp, you never steer me wrong!  The hubby and I went on a Tuesday night and we sat at the bar. We decided on AYCE and that is definitely the way to go. Price is standard at $26.95.   We ordered side dishes first: grilled yellow tail collar, fried calamari, grilled pork belly and baked green mussels. Baked green mussels were good but not nearly as good as Sin City Sushi. We liked everything for the most part but the grilled pork belly is something special. The pork belly was juicy, flavorful and melted in my mouth.  We mostly stuck with nigiri and everything was fresh with not too much rice. The standouts for me were the super white tuna and snow crab meat. Our chef, Mike, suggested a variety of items to try and one of them was rice, raw quail egg and masago wrapped in seaweed. It was surprisingly yummy.   The only roll we had lived up to it's name, Ecstacy Roll. I can't even remember what was in it but it was good! I like that you can do half orders.  What bumped this review up to 5 stars for me were the desserts. The hubby had the green tea creme brulee and I had the tempura ice cream. I wasn't too thrilled with the tempura because it was spongy and not at all crunchy. I did, however, eat most of the green tea creme brulee. It had a good consistency and right amount of sweetness. I still had a little bit of a sweet tooth so I ordered the lychee sorbet. It was so yummy and was a great way to cleanse the palette.   A huge plus was the exceptional service. The sushi chefs were friendly and were gracious enough to suggest different things to try. Our glasses were always full and empty plates were cleared right away.   I am now a believer of the type. I love that they have a frequent punch card. I expect to get that free 10th meal very soon!",

Every time I have been here, it has been for lunch, so I can't promise the same experience for dinner (although it sounds like everyone enjoys the evenings as well). I have also only gotten the AYCE (all-you-can-eat) experience so if you are ordering a la carte.... what's wrong with you?!?!?  :o)  But seriously, there are so many options and for an AYCE place, this is probably the best one I have been to in America (and that's saying a lot!). You can order half and full rolls, I recommend starting with a number of half-rolls so you can experience more of the options.  The flavors themselves are balanced and each roll is it's own unique experience.  In addition to the rolls, you can also enjoy a selection of grilled items. I loved the tofu!  I probably won't make it out here if I am not renting a car, but you better believe I will be back to Goyemon soon!",

Love their one-bite size sushi, unlimited strawberry & vanilla mochi, half-order of rolls. But fish are sometimes not so fresh.. I know it's AYCE...)  \"The waiting time: 2 stars\" (if you go to lunch & dinner time, especially dinner, you usually have to wait for 30-60min.)  \"The stamp card service: 5 stars\" (if you are living here and like AYCE sushi, then collect the stamps. 10stamps =1 free AYCE)  Okay, overall .. \"3 stars\" from my experiences!",

At that point, we were super lucky it was all you can eat because we were ravenous.    All the fish was fresh and tasty.  Everything was rolled nicely.  We were very happy.  The only dissapointed was the baked green mussels.  They were terrible.  I would go back if someone suggested it, but I certtainly wouldn't wait 40 minutes again for a table.  I think there are better places in Vegas.   We tried just about everything...hamachi, snapper, smoked salmon, uni, scallops, mussels, yakisoba, gyoza, 2  salads, miso soup, crispy pork belly, tuna rice cracker, 7 rolls including sexy girl, 911 (habenero makes it super spicy with good flavor, a nice departure from the usual jalapeno) , sunrise,  frying jason, pastel, and so on.    The service was nice and efficient and the punch card is an extra cool touch.  One really nice surprise is the variety of desserts offered.  The tofu cheesecake was extra delicious!",

I met Jessie B. for lunch here while on my way to my hair appointment in the area. We sat at the bar and most of the time I felt ignored by the chefs. It's almost as if they were purposefully trying to avoid eye contact. I sampled several half rolls, and they were all tasty with fresh ingredients. I just feel that with an imposed time limit for AYCE you really don't want to worry about being able to get the chef's attention since the wait to get your roll is still pretty solid once you do place the order, unless it is nigiri. I liked the scallop rolls Jessie had and 911 and Athena were solid. I think the rolls and the names are pretty much identical to Sushi-Mon who only had slightly higher rating from me due to better/faster service.",

I striked up a conversation with our waitress in Japanese and she explained to me that their tamago was made using a family recipe. She even gave me the option of just getting the tamago without rice. (Which I did and it was amazing!)  The sushi rolls were pretty good, it being my first time, I didn't really know what to get and had to check their website for picture references.

We ordered six different sushi platters including Hurricane, Alaskan, Dragon, Rainbow, Ecstasy and Frying Jason. All of them were absolutely delicious. It's hard to pick a favorite and describe every flavor. The hurricane sushi  and the flying fish stood out more because they have more of a crunch because its a tempura roll. Other than sushi, i also tried the Niko Udon soup bowl with thin sliced beef and noodles.  We sat in the private dining room. The service was good. However be prepared to wait for an hour on weekends. Also, they have an AYCE options on the specials, which is a great deal if you can shove as many sushi rolls in 60 minutes, The time constraint is a bummer but they're pretty good on bringing out the platters fast.",

Also the cut of the nigiri sushi was the smallest and roughest cuts ive seen so far in lv and they were all pretty bland. The chef didnt even understand my orders very well. He assumed I meant 4pcs and not 4 orders which really annoyed me since their 1 order is considered 2pcs!!! I think sushi mon also does small cuts but their quality is so much better so its forgivable. Fyi...i didnt have a  japanese sushi chef nor an asian one  which i think another reason why he was so slow and cut the fish so poorly... Once he knew i was annoyed he started picking up the pace but i literally had to drown my sushi in soy sauce bc they tasted like nothing.

Yeah, I ate too much but it was worth it. The hurricane roll was by far my favorite. The service was great, the ambience was great, and I liked that it was away from the strip.",

    "text": "The AYCE sushi places in Las Vegas are top notch.  Where else can you eat your fill of nigiri sushi for about $25 a person?    We arrived early, at about 530-545 pm and the restaurant was already full.  With only a short wait, we took two seats at the sushi bar, which proved to be a blessing.  It was so much easier to give our orders directly to the sushi chefs and instantaneously receive our sushi.  At a table, you're at the mercy of the waitresses, who are harder to come by.   Do yourself a favor, don't waste time on the rolls.  Not even one.  I don't care how interesting that fried/eel sauced concoction sounds.  They are huge, heavy and a waste of stomach space. We had the Cynthia roll and a Soft Shell Crab roll of some kind and while you can get 1/2 rolls (4-5 pieces) they are clunky monsters, bigger than the size of your mouth and glopped with mayo and eel sauce.   Instead, focus on the sushi.  There are two-order limits on just two kinds of sushi - the amebi (sweet shrimp) and the uni (sea urchin) so make sure you order those to the max.  The uni was great - fresh and creamy and extremely flavorful.  We also really enjoyed the yellowtail and the salmon belly and liked the halibut, aji, and unagi.  With the amebi, request that the heads be fried, because they come to you in a miso soup, which is a nice contrast to all the cold foods you are eating.   Goyemon isn't just about sushi though.  They have a pretty decent hot foods menu to provide some variety to the meal.  The pork belly was tiny in portion and not super tender.  The grilled vegetables are nicely grilled.  They even have udon and a ramen which is only available if you're there late at night.    Make sure to save room for dessert.   Though they have things like green tea icecream or fried icecream, they readily admit those things are store-bought.  They take greater pride in their housemade green tea brulee, which has a sweet, subtle, jiggly matcha pudding with a paper thin brulee on top.  Another delicious dessert is the lychee sorbet, which is store-bought, but really aromatic and a nice palate cleanser.    This is no Nozawa but the quality was really quite good and for the price, unbeatable.",

    "text": "One of the top three all you can eat (AYCE) sushi places in Las Vegas.  Goyemon has everything I want in a sushi establishment and more.    *shakes butt*  This place will get busy and that's why I come in when when they're at it's slowest or before the dinner rush.  This place doesn't close until 3am but the last seating for all you can eat is 2am.  If I'm ever in the mood for some late night AYCE this is my absolute go to spot.    There is a late night special, the Shoyu ramen is available after 11pm.  It is tasty.  There are other special items available throughout the day as well, look at the board.  I like sitting at the bar because I can ask for more and be served quicker.  The menu is vast and I feel sorry for people who comes here to order rolls, nigiri (sushi pieces) all the way.    Simply put, no fancy stuff here just good quality sushi.  If we were to dine here, don't look at me weird when I start off with 15 orders of Conch (when available) and 15 orders scallop nigiri.  Some servers strictly enforce the time limit rule which is stupid, especially if the restaurant isn't busy at all.    If you get AYCE, you can get a stamp card but they don't always tell you that or remind you.  So you have to bring it up, if you forget your stamp card you can have your receipt stamped and bring it back with your stamp card.",

I knew they often get very busy and the wait tends to be long, so I called ahead and made sure it wasn't a longer wait than we'd preferred. This was early Saturday evening, and when we arrived, we ended up getting seats at the sushi bar immediately for two, no wait at all. We decided to not go for the all-you-can-eat, and ordered the ecstasy roll, California roll, seared salmon, seared tuna, yellowtail, super white tuna, and the sunrise. My favorite all of them all was the ecstasy roll. There was such good and strong flavor to it, and the seaweed salad with fish eggs on top just made it so much better. The service was great, and orders of the sushi and rolls came out pretty quickly. Would I have waited an hour to eat here? Probably not. But the food wasn't bad.",

Gets pretty crowded and at peak times, it could be a wait. The place is small, but their quality is  good. I especially like the fact that they're close by my boyfriend's apartment. It can get quite loud with large groups, and other people trying to hear their company. Ample parking, both close to restaurant and in the plaza. If the place is packed, prepare to wait to order and eat. The portion size is great, not just piece but the size, I didn't get too full fast. I still was able to order a small scoop of Lychee sorbet . I was definitely a happy camper after this experience.",

I do not see my favorite sushi guys and I know one in particular does not work here anymore. While the food is still made right and the cuts were decent, it lost that personal, familiar charm and the new guys didn't make an effort to really talk. It was busy, so fair point that they may not have had the opportunity so maybe something will change again, with time.  The big thing for us was the rice has been too warm on visits of late. Last time it was affecting the fish that it was not appetizing. While I get they are busy, they should have someone making and properly cooling rice throughout. It happened twice at a busy but not line out the door rush time. The second time severely changed out love for this place.   We will probably come during a off time again and see what happens. I still thought the fish was fresh, I like the rotating specials and the many delicious dessert options.  As of right now, the changes has made this spot suffer a bit for me so it'll be a while until we are back. I'm hoping in that time they figure out how to deal with their popularity and adjust the way they do things to keep a standard.",

All the little Japanese touches you would expect like a samurai sword in the restroom. (Sarcasm).  Service: Fast and friendly service, every time we ordered things came out within 5 minutes. Drinks included in AYCE. We arrived early on a Friday night around 5 so there was no wait but when we left there was a line for bigger parties.   Food: They have daily specials that switch throughout the night which is great. We got to try out the Salmon belly which was not on the menu. The Uni and Sweet Shrimp although only one order per person on the AYCE menu us delicious. The best sushi for me on that is not one per person was the Snow Crab Meat, very sweet and delicious.  Price: The quality and freshness of ingredients backs up the 26.95 per person at night.   Final Thoughts: Look at the photos on Yelp and try more! Delicious!",

I came here before and I had to wait 45min to be seated, so we left. This time we were seated right away. It's hit or miss.  - 1 TV. If you want to watch a game, they have sports on at the bar. - Fancier than sushi mon. If you have eaten there, the sushi plates look a lot prettier. - Ordered and served to me. Service was quick to average. Took 5 to 10 mins to get my orders in. Got them in bundles.  - I recommend the ecstasy with orgasm sauce, spider, volcano, lemon roll?. avoid fukomaki. It wasted tummy space.  - No salmon skin roll or any kind of hand roll? did i miss something? I got it at sushi mon. :/ - For non-sushi, get the gyoza, grilled yellow tail, and pork belly. avoid the shumai. it's really tiny and mushy.   - After awhile, sushi got mushy, red dragon. Probably bc I was getting stuffed. lol.I drank it down was a really hot miso soup that hit the spot.  - Great desserts! I had tempura ice cream and strawberry mochi. There's  also green tea ice cream and creme brulee. way better than sushi mon.   ^___^!",

    "text": "This place is a must try for AYCE sushi in Vegas!  My husband I have been going here for a little over a year now, and have learned a couple of things after a few (we'll leave it at a few) visits.  First thing, come early or be ready to wait.  We usually come on the weekends and if you come during peak hours you could be waiting up to an hour sometimes (still worth the wait BTW).  Second, always do AYCE even if you think you're not that hungry.  The a la carte prices can get pricey and you're probably going to end up at the cost of the AYCE anyways.  Plus, be adventurous.  We love the AYCE here partly because you can try something without fear of not liking it.  Sushi house goyemon offers a loyalty card where you buy 10 AYCE and get the 11th free, so plenty of reason to come back.  The sushi at Goyemon is fresh and they are very generous.  I mostly stick with the Nigiri and the rolls which you can't go wrong with.  I'd also recommend trying the sashimi salad, rice cracker, and pork belly (mmmm pork belly!).  The desserts are a perfect ending to the meal, especially the mochi and the green tea creme brulee.  The service is just OK (thus 4 stars instead of 5).  I understand that they are busy on the weekends, but I usually find myself practically having to wave my hands in the air to get attention from our server.  A little more attention would have been much appreciated.  Overall, the food is outstanding while the service could be a bit better.  Still your best option in Vegas for AYCE sushi, hands down...4 stars.",

The service, while decent when we first got there,  went significantly bad the longer we stayed, and my party of 4 was only there for the allotted hour, even though there were many people there who had been there long before me.  The last 20 minutes we flat out got ignored, and once some of us got dessert, we were shoved the check and pushed out the door to leave.  The food also worse, but the nigiri was still solid, and the only reason why I am giving this 2 stars.  The cooked fish was still extremely dry, the pork belly was cold and rubbery, all of the cooked chicken dishes tasted very bad quality.  With all the other solid places in town, I don't understand why people still keep coming back here, and that includes the yelp elite groupies who have the grammar skills of a monkey and can't write a decent review. They all think they are extra special and try to get treated better because of it, then inflate their reviews of Goyemon higher than it should be.  And honestly if that's the case, shame on them.",

Cons  - Emptied dishes never be picked up on table even the table is covered with emptied dishes. - Staffs are unfriendly and completely ignore the customers. They walk away even they see you waving your hands for request. - Foods take more than 20mins even the business goes slow. - Mochi ice creams take 40mins to arrive including the time we request for the desserts twice.  Pros - The dishes are served in a very decent good portion.  Lastly, I personally do not refer this buffet restaurant to any of my friends. I own a customer service - oriented business in north Cali. I seriously concern about their quality of business if I'm the boss of this place when I know my staffs are ruining the reputation of the business.    I hope the owner of this business can take my advice and observe the quality of your staffs. Thanks.",

    "text": "On a late Thursday night, a friend and I were looking for a bite to eat, so after a quick search, we decided to try out Sushi Goyemon.  We saw online that they close at 3:00 am, which is usually the case for many sushi places in Vegas. We arrived at 2:15 am, and the sign on their door says that last call is at 2:30 am, so we still had time to order. We were seated and we ordered the chicken teriyaki bowl and green tea ice cream. Two simple items that tasted fine. However, I was in the middle of my meal and at 2:45 am, the woman who seated us approached us and humbly said, \"Sorry, I don't mean to rush you, but can you hurry up so I can close the restaurant?\" I thought we had had 15 minutes left, but I guess the entire staff wanted to go home, so they decided to rush us so they could close early. I wasn't even finished eating! We saw another table leave very shortly after that, and we were the only two left, with the rest of the staff just standing there watching us, waiting for us to leave. It wasn't even 3:00 am yet, but we left at 5 'til. I guess they actually close at 2:30 am instead. I took the rest of my food to-go, and we left. Don't visit this place if you're looking for common courtesy.",

It does cost more than your typical AYCE sushi joint, but DAMN is it way better!  27 for dinner is the price of admission to this wonderland of fish. They have a bunch of daily specials that you are more than welcome to try. My head was spinning trying to pick what I wanted, but then I slapped myself into reality to focus on the sushi, particularly the nigiri!  The nigiri here are pretty small which means I can eat a shitload of them! My favorites were the Ama-ebi (sweet shrimp) served with the deep fried head, the salmon, the hamachi (yellowtail), and the kanpachi (amperjack which was one of the daily specials). I didn't want to try the numerous other things, but next time I'm in Vegas I will definitely try more.   I mean HEY, be happy! Come here late at night, have some sushi and just chill! This place is definitely worth trying if you're feeling for some AYCE sushi in Vegas. I wasn't disappointed!",

    "text": "I was surprised I hadn't reviewed Goyemon before - I've been neglectful and aim to make up for it now.  We were craving sushi, and with so many good AYCE places in town we decided on one of our favorites, Sushi House Goyemon on Decatur.  Yes, we knew better and still we arrived at 7 PM.  After a wait of about 1.5 hours (I swear, it's worth it to satisfy your AYCE sushi craving) we were seated.  The guys took a picture of the specials board and then simply decided they wanted one of everything (not including dessert).  I perused the on-line menu earlier that day (the anticipation was killing me) and decided I would focus on trying various rolls besides having a few of my favorites.  Let me start by sharing with you that I was especially happy with the AYCE in that you can order 1/2 a roll (four pieces).  Who needs more justification than that?  I started with Sexy Girl:  a harmony of shrimp tempura, crab meat & cucumber with a generous kiss of spicy tuna and scallop yum yum on top, then sprinkled with tempura crumbs, a spicy garlic and spicy eel sauce.  I was very happy with the ratio of fish to rice.  My very scientific measurement is if I can put one whole piece in my mouth.  Too much rice and there is no way I can; just the right amount and it fits like a glove.  Slightly warm and sooo good!   I'll sheepishly admit I ordered a 2nd 1/2 roll as my last item of the evening.  I quickly ordered my favorite nigiri, hamachi (yellow tail).  It was so fresh and delicate and just beautiful.  Mmmm...  I ordered the garlic tuna as well, which I enjoyed but truthfully like the garlic sauce a bit more at some other places.  The pork belly with mango salsa is a must have when we go - it never disappoints!  Succulent and juicy on the inside, charred on the outside pairs perfectly with the sweet mango salsa.  Time for a palate cleanser!  No Name roll was perfect - Spicy tuna and asparagus that still has a nice bit are blanketed by the delicate flavors of yellow tail.  This roll is served cold and is bland compared to others.  The fish sing in this composition, and it was really quite refreshing.  My husband and I shared a bowl of octopus poki (good, just not one of my favorites) and I snagged a piece of his unagi (eel) as well as a piece of someone's Red Dragon (spicy tuna, cucumber, & avocado with eel and eel sauce on top).  I really wanted to try dessert, I really did.  But I couldn't.  My belly was very happy and very full.",

    "text": "I gave them 4 stars on my first visit for dinner AYCE.....and I was hoping that it would be as good for lunch AYCE....no such luck.  It was atrocious, revolting excuse for sushi.  When I walked in, I had a bad feeling when I saw two latino looking sushi chefs at the tsukeba.  Not that I have anything against non-japanese itamae, but from my fairly vast experience....it's not a good sign in general and boy was I right.    Since I'm Japanese, I don't order any rolls.  I always go with straight nigiri, none of those yum yum sauce, fancy rolls bulshit and here are what's wrong with their \"sushi\".  1)  It was ugly.  Cuts of fish were uneven, too small, and were just very asymmetrical and poorly balanced with rice.  When you have two pieces and they look so different, there is a significant lack in their sense of aesthetics, and more importantly, utter luck of skill.  2)  Sushi rice was horrendous.  To make things worse, there were 2 sushi \"chefs\" and they seem to be using very inconsistent sushi rice.  One was soft and overly sticky, and the other was dry and hard.  Neither of them had proper vinegar flavor, and was too bland to be called \"sushi rice\".  They obviously have no idea or skill to make proper sushi rice, which is just as, if not MORE important than the fish that goes on it.    3)  Utter lack of nigiri skill.  Sushi rice was too hard.  You had to chew it.  That is what happens to amateurs and newbies who do not have the proper skills to maintain shape of nigiri while having enough air within it so that if falls apart in the mouth.  4)  The wasabi issue- I was embarrassed for them.  My first order of nigiris had no wasabi.  So I asked the waitress (non-japanese) that I need to have wasabi in the sushi.  She comes back 2 minutes later that \"most people\" don't want wasabi so the \"chefs\" cannot put wasabi in the nigiri.  Let me repeat \"THE CHEFS CANNOT PUT WASABI IN THE NIGIRI\"  Let me make this straight.  In Japan, the sushi chefs will occasionally make UPON REQUEST nigiris WITHOUT wasabi for little children, I mean like kindergarden aged kids. Never do they even consider NOT putting wasabi for adults.  So I tell this non Japanese waitress that I don't care what \"most people\" want.  I want wasabi in the nigiri so that I don't have to peel the fish off of rice and have to put it on there, and it is the PROPER way to make a nigiri.  So she goes back and talks with this \"chefs\" and they finally comply with my \"request\" to make a proper nigiri WITH wasabi.    It's very unfortunate that whoever the Japanese sushi chef is there allows these \"sushi chefs\" to let these joke of a sushi out to customers under their roof.  I asked the waitress if there are any Japanese chefs at lunch time and she says that it depends on their schedule, sometimes yes, sometimes not.  Well if a real chefs can't be there to properly supervise these jokers then they might as well close down the restaurant instead of allowing these atrocious nigiri's out to the customers who may have the palate and knowledge of what a real sushi should be like.    The management should be embarrassed with what went on today.  If people think that this kind of atrocity is sushi, then I am truly saddened.  There are better restaurants with real japanese sushi chefs in this town who serve decent AYCE sushi.  But if people have numb enough palates to keep going here then so be it.",

Gave my name to the host for a table for two, waited a good 15 mins, gentleman who comes in after, gets seated before me, really? Um ok? Finally seated and drink orders placed, my iced green tea tastes like dirty water. Then we order a couple things (I generally don't do AYCE sushi because I find the fish isn't good) so I opted to do a la carte for my first visit. I don't like rolls with mayo, or dairy, or sauces like \"orgasm sauce\". I immediately noticed the rice to fish ratio was way off, fish was dry, rice was dry. Great.   Now let me get to the service.....we couldn't get our server to come around once, the cutest little old lady sitting at the table next to us flagged a server down for her check and then told them that we needed our server as well. Again, never saw her. At this point it's when I contemplated walking out and leaving money for what I thought we owed. Service was atrocious. Never refilled my drink and couldn't order any more food, which was probably a good thing. I will never give this place a second try or recommend. Overrated.",

However, we had octopus in the salad (yes the is a part of shellfish allergys). I just wish it had all of the ingredients listed in the fish salad before I ordered it. Regardless the rolls we ordered were  a million times better than the salad. I can't wait to eat the puffy roll again. I like that the rolls are not too cold and you can tell your rice is fresh. Additionally, they have pictures on their menu! I would definitely come back.",

    "text": "What a disappointment.  My party arrived around midnight on a Friday night. The restaurant was packed and on initial appearance looked to have been a great, late night dinner selection. Sadly, the entire evening went south from there. We were a group 3 and were first in queue to be sat. The hostess had us slotted with a wait time of 20 minutes. That 20 minutes passed, and passed, and passed.. all the while the hostess was loudly talking to the table beside her about drugs and other college influences.   The 20 minutes ended up taking over an hour, and finally when a table to seat 3 was available.. the hostess was nowhere to be seen.  The hostess reappears and looked to be doing some sort of \"paperwork\". After waiting about 5 minutes I decided to walk up to her and ask \"excuse me.. can we sit here now?\". She continues working on whatever she is doing and spouts \"oh that's reserved for a group that's waiting\". Confused.. I look around, and SURPRISE, there are no other groups but my party.  She looked up, finally acknowledging me, and says \"oh are you the party for 'X'?\" ..... that should have been my queue to cut my losses and just leave.. I'm the fool.  Turns out she was closing out her to-go orders so that she could leave. You know we waited an hour, and you knew the table was open... I figured common sense was... common.  Let's get to the food and service. The waitress was quick to bring us drinks and take our initial order.  The food also came out in a timely fashion.  The first bite was underwhelming. The nigiri tasted like pre-made sushi. The rolls were better than the nigiri, but not by much. Every single roll broke apart causing the dreaded soy sauce rice pool.   Do not order the seared salmon. It's definitely pre-made. It comes out cold and they put so much ponzu sauce on it that it's nearly inedible.  The 2nd and 3rd orders took far too long to process. You need to wave down your waitress and endure them telling you to wait for any and everything. I know serving is a difficult job, I was a server for many years, but she took no time to check up on us.  If you want sushi... avoid this place.. subpar sushi with terrible service. If you like to be frustrated then this is the place for you!  Note: I forgot my retainer at our table and decided to cut my losses... I'd rather buy a new retainer than to ever step inside this establishment again.",

I would say that it is on par with some of the best AYCE sushi spots back in SoCal, if not better. The ratio between fish & rice was perfect. It was not too much fish or not too much rice. The rolls were a bit disappointing though. The presentation was not quite as good as I expected and the taste was whatever. I would recommend ordering from the starters (miso soup, seaweed salad, etc), nigiri, or hand rolls.   The service was pretty good.

We wanted to try a variety of items but it was a clear mistake. Best to order 2-3 types of nigiri then do a bunch of orders for each.   The big thing with places like this is they perform really well at the beginning to draw high reviews but once they are somewhat established, they start to take a nose dive on the quality front.",

    "text": "Spent the last few days yelping sushi spots in the valley because I wanted my diet break meal to be epic!  Goyeman was very good. The taste, quality and wide selection of sushi met my expectations as you fellow Yelpers have reviewed. My wife and I both got the AYCE. I got 3 specialty rolls, 2 nigiri, and 3 side dishes including ice cream tempura. The wife got 3 specialty rolls as well.   I have eaten at a couple AYCE sushi spots in the valley but my wife had never been with me. When we go to buffets she tends to like to sample a bunch of different things and often leaves some on the plate if she didn't like it (and YES I get on her about wasting food). Anyways, Goyeman BLEW MY MIND when they charged her extra for NOT finishing her rolls. So 2 of the 8 piece rolls she ate 4 pieces of each. So in addition to the AYCE price, they charged us the 1/2 the price of each roll. I've never seen anything like it in my life! I thought the waitress was messing with us until she pulled out a little plastic card by the menus and it outlined the same.   I don't eat anything with cheese or mayo so I couldn't touch them. I would have eaten them and saved us the additional $10 if I could.   When that happens they let you take the additional pieces home. We were going to run some errands when we left and it was 98 today so taking the sushi with us did us no good and it was thrown away 2 hours later.  If I find out other AYCE sushi spots in the valley do this strange charge thing, I'll come back and change my review to a 5. But I did not appreciate paying more for rolls we didn't eat. One of them, she legitimately didn't even like. So because you order it you gotta pay? I just can't wrap my head around it...  So good sushi for sure but as of now, definitely will NOT be going back.",

    "text": "Goyemon is one of the best sushi spots in Vegas. They have a huge assortment of rolls and make all kinds of nigiri. When it comes to seafood, there's not a lot that I'm willing to eat so I appreciate their large selection of menu items to choose from. I personally love their spider hand rolls, the sexy girl roll, and yellowtail (hamachi) nigiri. They also have specials written on the chalkboard for things like salmon collar and yellowtail collar which I highly recommend.   When Goyemon first opened, they had some really unique appetizers and amazing desserts. Over the past year or so, these specialties have almost disappeared altogether. Their dessert selection is nowhere near as good as it used to be. They used to have things like green tea creme brulee and chocolate mouse in addition to the typical sushi house selection of ice cream and mochi. I know its a little silly call out a sushi place for its dessert, but it was one of the things that was great about this place that set it apart from its competitors.   Anyhow, back to the sushi. They are a great option for AYCE (all you can eat). If you think you'll eat more than 2 orders of rolls, then you might as well go AYCE. It includes appetizers, all the nigiri, the rolls, ice cream, and mochi.   As Goyemon is a very popular spot, the wait time for dinner can often be well over 30 minutes. If you come with a large group or eat here often, be sure to ask for a stamp card. From experience, I know you can use the stamp card at the two Sushi Mon locations as well. If the wait at Goyemon is too long, I'd recommend calling the Sushi Mon on Sahara and checking their wait time as the menus are exactly the same, though the specials might vary.",

    "text": "The first ayce sushi restaurant I've been to about 5 years ago, and I'm surprised I never got to review this place!  Right off the bat- I'd like to say that it's best to go during lunch (specifically when they just open) because it's a pretty small spaced restaurant and it's quite popular. **It's a 99% chance you'll be on the wait list during dinner!**  The wifey and I went during lunch an hour before dinner started and there was probably only about 3 tables open out of like.. (guesstimating) 8 tables + the sushi bar. We had gotten seated immediately from a young and kind waitress, and was serviced quickly for beverages.  She had went for the lunch special chicken teriyaki bowl, about $5.50-$6. And I of course went with the all-you-can-eat which is around the same price as every other lunch ayce $21-$22.  The quality of the sushi is top notch (ayce standards). My fav, garlic tuna nigiri, was so freshly garlic'd that it didn't even need to be bedded in a generous portion of the garlic ponzu(?) sauce.  & Fish to rice ratio: not so bad. About 8/10. All of my orders came quickly as well and the two servers + busperson were attentive and even paid attention if I made eye contact with them so that they can come and help. That's very rare!   We finished at 3:45pm (yes, we're quick eaters) and when the check came they had mischarged me for dinner ayce price! But after letting our main server know, she apologized and charged me for lunch. We also got a stamp card too and can be used for their sister restaurants as well! (I believe the only sister restaurant I know from them is Monta Ramen).  Overall really great service and pretty good sushi! I recommend for lunch special + ayce lunch forsure. Thank you Goyemon.",

    "text": "The amount of love I have for this place is truly sickening!  This has been my go-to sushi spot for the past 6 years.   First off, I'm not a seaweed fan... I was scarred by seaweed in my childhood lol.  So I only eat tempura rolls and/or nigiri (and appetizers).  I love that the AYCE includes appetizers, and now ramen as well too!  My husband and I come here on a monthly basis.  We both do the AYCE and order a ton of appetizers.  Some of our favorites are: spicy tuna cracker (FAVORITE!!), garlic edamame, teriyaki chicken (hit or miss), shrimp tempura (2 pieces/order), vegetable tempura, udon noodles, and pork belly with mango salsa (hit or miss).  My favorite nigiri here is the cajun albacore nigiri.  The food comes out family-style, meaning it just comes out as it is done.  So we usually order everything at once.  They have a specials board.  Some of our favorites have been the lemon salmon nigiri, chocolate mousse, cookies-n-cream ice cream, and the sesame mochi (favorite!!).  We haven't seen the sesame mochi in forever.  That was the best dessert ever!  That's the sad thing about specials... you get attached to temporary items!   We love this place so much that we had our rehearsal dinner here.  That time, we were sat in the private room on the left.  It was a chaotic night with some food being served to the wrong tables and missing items.  But we were a party of 20, so I understand.   Service is hit or miss here.  It just depends on who your server is.  This is why I am giving this place 4 stars.  Also because of the inconsistency.  The food doesn't always taste the same, and sometimes it's cold.  More often than not though, everything is great.  If you are going to order a lot of sushi/nigiri, I would highly suggest sitting at the sushi bar!  Your food comes out much quicker, and it's cool to watch the sushi chefs!  Make sure you come during dinner, as they don't have the full appetizer menu available during lunch.  Also, be sure to ask for a stamp card.  For every 10 AYCE meals purchased, you get a free meal.",

    "text": "So, I've been to this place 3 times and all three have been negative experiences. I'm going to focus on this last time because that's really what made me never want to go back. First of all, the wait is always long. Perhaps that's because the wait staff takes forever to care for the costumers. After waiting 30 mins we finally get a table. I ordered a tempura box for the kids, my boyfriend had the \"all you can eat\" and i myself ordered a roll. We ordered waters but had to wait for our waiter to come back because he didn't think to leave any straws. Most of the stuff my boyfriend kept trying to order they didn't have and were already out of.... umm why not mention that when the costumer orders all u can eat?? It was getting late and our waiter pretty much disappeared. I had to ask someone else for a box and the check. I got the box (no plastic bag to go with it, I guess you ask for that separately) and the check but after 10 mins and still no sign of our waiter I decided to get up, walk to the front and get a plastic bag and pay the check. Needless to say we didn't leave a tip. Despite of how some of the service industry people might feel, you are not entitled to a tip, you earn one. There's been times when the waiter was so good, I tipped more than my bill to encourage that waiter/waitress to continue to provide good service. This waiter never came by to check up on us, no water refills and I had to walk up and pay my own check because he literally disappeared. Half the time I spent sitting there was waiting for my waiter to reappear, maybe this is why it takes forever to get a table. Either way, I personally don't plan to come back, there's many other good sushi places in town where they appreciate repeated costumers. Believe me there's nothing special about this place. Food is good but not worth the hassle.",

But being small allows the staff to be more attentive, which was great!  The wait was around 90 minutes, but it was worth the wait.  Also, they have an awesome system that allows you to track your standing.  It's different from other AYCE buffets.  The servers still come and take your order and all you have to do is stuff your faces lol.    The quality of food is awesome. Everything on their menu was fresh and enjoyable. Some of the ones that we enjoyed the most were the fresh salmon nigiris, shrimp tempera, eel, 911, and something ruby roll.  Make sure you get the half(4pieces) orders so you can try as many as you can.   Seriously, I think I was so stuffed to the point I felt sick... which I don't recommend but it was definitely worth the visit.  Will probably make it our go to place in vegas!   Oh, and don't forget the Mochi ice cream and Lychee sorbet!!! Perfect ending to the meal.",

    "text": "Living in Dayton, OH, you experience first world problems like not being able to find a wide selection of sushi, let alone good quality sushi whenever you want it.  As such, it became somewhat of a moral imperative that the wife and I get our fill of sushi while in town.  After a little Yelp research and based on the recommendations of trusted local Yelpers, we ventured off-Strip for lunch at Sushi House Goyemon on a Tuesday.  We arrived around noon, the dining room was a little over half full, but all of the seats at the bar were open.  We sat at the bar and the adventure began.  With almost 1500 reviews, there isn't much more that I can add to the discussion.  You either like sushi or you don't.  The concept of AYCE sushi made to order appeals to you or it doesn't.  One more opinion likely isn't going to sway your dining decision.  Goyemon's AYCE sushi for lunch ($21.95) and dinner ($26.95) seemed a buck or two less expensive than its peer competitors.  Although the lunch didn't offer items like uni, which I love, I was fine with not having it as an option for lunch.  Their Daily Special nigiri selections were outstanding and more than made up for any items excluded from on the lunch menu.  The special salmon belly was mindblowing with its fatty, almost butter like flavor and the special Mentaiko (a marinated fish roe) was something that I'd never seen offered before even at high-end places like Nobu and Morimoto.  It was great trying something completely new.  Service was fast and friendly as our orders came out at a steady rate.  The most important thing about any sushi joint is the freshness of its seafood.  Goyemon had amazingly fresh seafood.  No strange or fishy smells, only that of the ocean.  The quality and freshness of the seafood was on par with high-end places, but at a fraction of the price.  It certainly beat anything we could find in Dayton.  I truly understand why Sushi House Goyemon is a favorite among locals.  If you love sushi, I highly recommend this place for lunch, but I also imagine it's great for dinner, too, which is something I'm sure we'll try the next time the wife and I are in town.",

A favorite of ours was the grilled pork belly, it would come fresh from the grill with a pleasant crunch on the outside with your first bite but would melt in your mouth from then on. The sushi was the main reason we wanted to come back. From fresh and balanced yellowtail and uni, to their consistent fatty salmon and tuna. Their sushi was unbelievable for an all you can eat location!  It's been about a year since we came to this place and coming back made us miss the Goyemon that once was. The appetizers and desserts came lukewarm, barely any fish came with the rice, and the quality just dropped. Now don't get me wrong, I absolutely love sushi rice and I wouldn't have had a problem if it was made properly. Over cooked sushi rice with too much water, with a less than desirable seasonings that sushi rice needs to have its character. The increase of business and customers may have taken it's toll on one of Vegas' greats. The fish was good, just not enough of it with orders, and if the rice is bad then what the hell can you do about the sushi! Goyemon you were a great friend and we had a great run, but it's time to move on.   Here's an extra star for old times sake. Good luck Goyemon.",

    "text": "Sushimon and Goyemon, but moreso Goyemon due to distance, have been my go-to places for AYCE sushi. There's never a trip to Vegas where I have not stopped by to dine, even during business trips to Vegas. However, at this last visit, I've became very disappointed by foremost the quality of the fish and secondly with the service.  Every non-nigiri item came out first -- the appetizers and regular rolls. We sat for quite a while waiting for even just one of our nigiri orders. Sadly, the long wait wasn't rewarded at the end.  Halibut nigiri... stringy and chewy. Had to spit out part of it because I really couldn't swallow it.  Scallop...lots of lemon juice. Did not seem fresh.  Cajun albacore...completely doused in sauce.  1/3 of the nigiri fish were smaller than before, which made it seem like there was too much rice given.  At least the snow crab meat is still good, so we loaded up on multiple orders of that. Seeing that this may be my last trip to Goyemon (will likely go back to Sushimon), I also ordered my usual 2 orders of green tea ice cream and 2 orders of lychee sherbet, while getting the tempura ice cream just for kicks (the tempura batter gets to you at the second quarter piece you eat).  I'm sad that I will likely not return, unless things change, and I hope that the diminishing quality didn't hit Sushimon as well.",

    "text": "I just moved to Vegas a few weeks ago and I've been craving sushi and sashimi for a while. Coming from California and being near the coast, I was hesitant about trying seafood in a desert state. How fresh can the seafood be? Goyemon surprised me.   FOOD:  Lunch and dinner menus offer appetizers, sushi, rolls, sashmi, salads, udon, and combinations. Main entree's range from $9-15 on average. They also offer an all you can eat option at lunch and dinner prices. I ordered the SS combination which includes 7 slices of sashimi and California roll. The combination includes miso soup, salad, and rice.   QUALITY: Fresh. I've had California roll where the seaweed had odd fishy flavor and chewy pieces of sashimi, but not here. Every slice of fish melted in my mouth.   CUSTOMER SERVICE: I ordered to go but received friendly service over the phone.   ENVIRONMENT: The restaurant appeared to be busy and lively. The place is medium sized with a sushi bar.   Overall, I'm coming back!",

We came during lunch right at 12pm when it opened and there was no wait to get seated. It was pretty small inside with limited seating at its bar and tables, so come early if you don't want to wait. About 30 minutes into eating, there was a huge line waiting outside so just a heads up.  The sushi was amazing. It tasted fresh and was nicely presented. My favorite is definitely unagi and it did not disappoint. We ordered various nigiri, appetizers, and rolls and after a while, they all started tasting the same but that was not a problem because it was all good. One thing I would stray away from is their fried calamari appetizer. It had a unique, chewy texture and was sour. Not that appetizing and it almost ruined our appetite. Good thing we had that near the end. My absolute favorite thing would have to be the lychee sorbet though. It was nice and creamy and it was a good surprise to find chunks of lychee jelly inside.",

It's open late as well, making this a sure bet for good dining after a show or spending the day in meetings.  Favorites: pork belly, ecstasy roll, and the lychee sherbet! The 911 roll is one of the hottest I've had, so if that's your interest - give it a go! Cons: Plan on a wait - no phone reservations, but once you are there they will let you wander and text when they are ready!",

I usually just get a lot of the super white tuna and salmon belly nigiris. I don't really do rolls but if you do order a roll, the good thing is you can order a half roll.   Usually I don't have too much complaints about this place but today we must have had a first time sushi chef. We sat at the sushi bar gave our order and the sushi chef would forget our orders and we would have to reorder. Our server forgot our orders for our side dish appetizers and we ended up not getting our appetizers. Food is a little better than the service lol.",

The major issue is the service. All the servers have extreme attitude and would just throw the food on the table and walk away, not even explaining what it was. That was if the food even showed up at all. Orders apparently went missing even though we were here for lunch and it was slow. The guys behind the sushi bar were on their phones... shouldn't take 20 mins to get two orders of Nigiri. AYCE is 45 mins so make sure you order everything the moment you get here since it takes the full 45 to even receive anything.  The only reason I'm giving this place two stars is because the sushi still tastes good but Goyemon is not the same anymore and I probably won't be back, not when you have excellent places like Sakana",

Price is very reasonable for the options that are available. Huge selection of appetizers (some that you will never see at AYCE chains), nigiri, rolls, and sushi. Their quality is pretty consistent and is high for an AYCE restaurant. I always leave with an upset stomach when I go to AYCE and buffets, but it's never the case with this place! *4 stars overall for the food and price.  Service could be good or bad depending on how crowded the restaurant is, and of course, what time you go in. I usually go at opening for lunch or very early for dinner so the service I get is always great. Waitress always get the order correct and is SUPER fast taking down my long list of orders which I have to say is AMAZING! *5 stars overall for the service.

I went there since at least 2006. This is theirs too but I always thought the sushi was better at the original location. We went on Saturday at 3:30 and waited about 30-40 min. The staff is efficient as the other place. The fish was fresh. And they have pork bellies here. The rice is not as sticky though and it falls apart often.  Is it me or are they putting more and more Yuzu sauce in things? I am not a big fan of it because I think it masks the flavor of the fish. Overall I can't complain but it's nothing to gloat about. This place is probably in my top 5. The edamame is a little saltier than I like. The salmon eggs and quail egg is placed side by side here. Usually I like it on top. I'd rather eat at Sushimon but it's a matter of principle. You get crap service and there's no one to complain to. They are so busy making money with their 4 locations that they can probably care less about one customer even if this one has been patronizing them for years.  The desserts were good. I think everyone can find something to like. This place is good and deserves 4 stars because there are a lot of bad sushi places too.",

It's a small sushi place, but luckily it wasn't busy when we got there. They don't take reservations, or at least that's what the lady told me. Their menu has a pretty good selection of rolls and hot foods and the service was quick most of the time. My favorite was the salmon roll, I can't remember the exact name (salmon supreme? some shit like that) It was just salmon on the inside with more salmon on top LOL. Also, I loved the garlic tuna nigiri. Fish seemed like it was a good quality.  For dessert I had the lychee sorbet and the tempura ice cream. The tempura ice cream was okay, but I really enjoyed the lychee sorbet.  A bummer was that uni was only served during dinner time. Now idk my sushi rules all that well but if you ask me, uni should just be served 24/7 with no limitations. I mean it's called AYCE man. Gotta have that sea urchin ;)",

They don't smile, they don't acknowledge that they've heard your order either.  It used to be fun sitting at the bar, but now it's so depressing.  Sitting at a table is a terrible idea too since service is so slow and the servers screw up your order all the time.  We've been frequenting Goyemon for years and it has progressively gone down hill.  I feel it's finally time to say something.   The freshness of the food has stayed relatively consistent.  One thing I must mention, and there is probably a direct correlation to the sushi chefs, is the quality of the rolls.  They look like a 2 year old made them.  Sloppy, ingredients falling out, rolls falling apart.  I can't even pick up a roll without it falling apart.  Sometimes way too much sauce and sometimes no sauce at all.  This situation is not just a one time \"off day\".  It's been at least three times.   Mayhaps it's time for you to find a different AYCE sushi place.  Unless mgmt does something about this issue.  We've been to JJanga to get our AYCE fix recently and not only is it fresh, but everybody is so nice and the rolls actually look and taste like a sushi chef made them instead of a 2 year old.",

The salmon is a little on the tiny side, especially if you're ordering ala cart, almost $5 for 2 pieces of tiny salmon is not really that great. Aside from the portion sizes, the fish seems to be very fresh and tastes great. I took my husband here for our anniversary and we got AYCE, we made the mistake of ordering sweet shrimp.. we generally aren't shrimp lovers, but we wanted to try it since it was one of the things that the dinner menu offers.. we shared 1 order, he ate his in one bite.. mine had the tail attached so I was using my chop sticks to sort of.. cut the tail off, once I was able to get the tail off I noticed the shrimp hadn't been deveined.. total turn off. It's literally not that hard to devein an order of shrimp, it makes the restaurant look lazy and makes me question other things. If we go back, we definitely won't be ordering shrimp. Our go-to place is I Love Sushi, but we wanted a go-to AYCE sushi place, since I Love Sushi doesn't offer AYCE.   The waitress we had was great.. I was nervous because a lot of the reviews said the food was great, but the service was terrible. Our waitress was super nice and our food came out relatively fast.   All in all I'd give Goyemon a 4.. If I hadn't received a poopy shrimp, I would have probably been more apt to give them a 5. So hey, Goyemon.. devein your shrimp, it's kind of gross.",

This place definitely the exception to that. Easily the best AYCE I have had in Vegas.  The quality of their fish is really good being that we are nowhere near an ocean or decent body of water. Also inexpensive for the price.   I usually judge a place on the quality of their nigiri not the rolls. The salmon belly is my favorite! Also they have great scallops. Also AYCE includes  grilled fish which is awesome. Grilled super white tuna is easily my second favorite.   The lack of 5 stars is due to the rush on getting you served and out. It gets so bad that I have been asked what I want to order before I had sat all the way down, then again 30 seconds later and again 30 seconds after that (I wish I was kidding).

As for nigiris, those were the smallest I've ever seen in my entire life. I don't understand why they have to make each nigiri so minuscule. On top of that, we had to wait forever to get the food we ordered. 1.5 hours to get all the food we order is simply too long. You can find all-you-can-eat sushi restaurant in California at much lower price, with much shorter wait time, and more authentic Japanese!",

We had to politely go up and let her know that we would like to be seated.  She kind of mumbles something and then walks away to go deliver checks to the respected tables.  We finally get seated.  All the waitresses were kind of serving all the tables. The sushi rolls all kind of tasted the same.  Though I did get enough food for my buck.  I should not have to continually ask for water and during down time see the hostess not doing anything.  But she did seat everyone who came in after us right away...  It made me miss my sushi place back home.  My sister was disappointed as well.",

I don't know if they switched owners or what's going on, but service was absolutely horrible today.   It took over an hour for our FIRST round of orders to come out. We complained twice about how slowly they're bringing out our food and both times, no apology.  We put in our second order, but after 20 minutes of putting in our second order, no food. We ended up just leaving without eating our second round of sushi because it was taking too long.   We wasted 1.5 hours here. Sushi was alright but not worth all the time wasted, and didn't even get our money's worth because of how long they took. We will not be coming back.",

They have a ton of specialty rolls, (TWO PAGES IN FACT) with all of their descriptions on the menu AND pictures of each one on a separate, laminated menu. All the rolls looked absolutely delicious and I was lucky to try many of them. I got a perfect seat in the bar right next to the sushi chef so my food came out quickly and I was able to get everything exactly the way I want it.   I highly recommend the ecstasy roll, the sweet shrimp unagi, and the volcano roll. They do not skimp out on the quality of the rolls even if you go with AYCE. The rolls are big and will fill you up real quickly if you do not pace yourself. There are SO many choices too, so come in being prepared to choose decisively so that you can get your food sooner.  Their desserts are also pretty bomb here as well. I talked with the chef and he told me that they have the only lychee gelato around. I ordered that and the green tea brulee. Both desserts were incredible, but I especially loved the green tea brulee. It wasn't overly sweet and I loved the green tea flavor and crispiness of the top.   It was a great meal and I'd come here again if I was in the area!",

I get it. But restrictions on ice cream mochi?? You telling me i can eat as many rolls that contain soft shelled crab or all the yellow tail and fatty tuna nigiri i want but i'm limited to ONE sphere of ice cream covered in sweet rice paste??  NOT Goyemon...Here you can pig out as much as you want. Had the spicy ass 911 roll and want to order an ice cream because 2 glasses of water, 3 packets of sugar, 3 bits of a spider roll, almost licking the plate the pork belly came from didnt work?? (True story) Well order some ice cream! It's dessert time and you've already ordered an ice cream? Well order some more ice cream! Damn that lychee sorbet hit the spot but you want another? Yeah you guessed it...order MOAR ice cream!!!  And the big ass list to get me some of those 'useful' clicks from you guys  Crispy Rice Cracker Spicy Tuna thingie  - Oh man this was awesome, Crispy rice with spicy tuna on top with some sauce i think it was yum yum sauce drizzled on top oh lord this was good  Pork Belly  - Being Vietnamese i've been eating pork belly most of my natural life...These grilled pork bellies are something else...Too much sauce on the pork belly? Still delicious. Not enough sauce on the pork belly? Still smokey grilled taste delicious  Deep Fried Prawn Heads - If you like prawn heads then order a batch of deep fried prawn heads they are AMAZING. If you dont likek deep fried prawn heads order a batch for someone who does like prawn heads.  Yeah i'm gonna stop reviewing now...making me hungry.",

Every time I've been here, the staff have been pretty accommodating (with the exception of Lin, who waved his finger at my sister, telling her she couldn't order any more sushi that one time we were seated at the bar).

    "text": "The $27 AYCE is definitely the way to go here. If you can get a spot at the bar, do so. But it was so packed when we got there around 9pm, and we waited about 10 minutes to get a table. Not that 10 minutes is bad, but I don't think the sushi bar even started clearing out until well after 11 pm.   The beers are pretty cheaply priced as well, at $3.50 per small bottle, and $5 for the large. They also have beers on tap that starts at $3.50 a pint.   My cousin and I mostly stuck to the nigiris because we feel that is the way to best get your moneys worth in an AYCE setting. Let me just say that the BEST thing we ate that night was definitely the sea urchin, as it was fresh, clean, and tasted like the deep ocean. The second best thing we ate that night was the super white tuna, which just has some kind of indescribably amazing mouthfeel to it. The third best thing was definitely the yellowtail collar, which everyone raved about on here. It was tender, juicy, tasty, and simple tasting. The kind of thing that doesn't need a sauce to add flavor. We also got the pork belly, which was good, but I think I'm spoiled at home when we grill pork belly and I didn't think it was as good as we get it at home. But if you don't get to enjoy pork belly in similar fashion, by all means it's still delicious.   My younger cousin definitely had it all out with everything fried on the menu. Calamari squid (which was super tender and not chewy at all), shrimp tempura, a bunch of shrimp tempura rolls, etc. She seemed to enjoy all the of them, and especially loved the lychee sorbet she got for dessert.  We also got some cut rolls, my favorite of them being the Lemon roll (california roll wrapped in tuna and lemon slices). I don't know what it is about the flavor of lemon on fresh fish, but I guess I'm just a sucker for fresh citrus or something. We also got one of the soft-shell crab rolls (I forget which one), and it was huge and pretty tasty. Nothing as extraordinary as the other fresh fish stuff, but still pretty good.   For the desserts, definitely get green tea creme brulee. It's a lot more custard that you would think. The tofu cheesecake was also delicious, but I think having the creme brulee first kind of overshadowed the cheesecake.   The only trouble I really had with the whole experience is that we ordered so much and so fast (we were really hungry) that when the food started coming out we had no idea what we had left because no one kept track and the food was coming out in random order and time. Some came out right away, others came out at least 30 minutes after we ordered. The sushi bar was constantly bustling, and is actually really small for the amount of orders they probably receive. Next time, I'm definitely implementing a way to keep track of our orders, because I think we didn't get a 911 roll or something. Not that it mattered seeing as we were extremely satisfied and had the AYCE. But it's still something to keep in mind because you order everything verbally to the waiter, and ours didn't seem to have everything organized lol. That was okay, because he still made sure that all of our food was coming out--to the best of our memory, at least.",

Only downside were their rolls which I knew after inspecting were a death trick when it comes to all you can eat. Massive amounts of fake crab meat and rice to help fill the empty void I created through starvation all day.  However everything else besides the rolls, sushi wise, were worth ordering... Shrimp tampura on the other hand was extremely salty.",

    "text": "This was the first stop of my Las Vegas Food Tour and wow was it a good one. I have to admit that this was my all time favorite sushi experience and definitely a top 3 overall dining experience.  I chose to sit at the bar (which I highly recommend from now on). I chose to do the AYCE and was flabbergasted by the large selection of nigiri, rolls and special rolls they had. You can add appetizers and desserts to the AYCE as well. Sushi Chef Fredo saw that I was completely clueless about what to order so I basically turned the keys over to him. He basically ordered for me, and I have to say that this is the only way to eat sushi from now on. It was an awesome experience. I also appreciated the way Fredo made the nigiri sushi...he didn't overpower the fish with a ton of rice underneath.  Highlights:  Pork Belly - At first, i thought the soy sauce marinade was gonna overpower the pork belly and make it really salty, but when i ate, it was incredibly delicate and tender. It is similar to chashu. In addition, the pork belly comes with a side of mango salsa to top off the meat. 5/5  Blue Fin Tuna, Toro, and Super White Tuna Nigiri - These were my top dishes for the night. The blue fin tuna was incredibly soft and tender, which makes it just melt in your mouth. It was freakin decadent. I was told that the toro is the belly of the tuna, which makes sense because it tasted fatty and tender...just the way i like it. And the super white tuna (which i've heard is escolar...not tuna) was also really good. It tasted like butterfish. 5/5  Hurricane Roll - the best of the special rolls IMO. It had shrimp tempura and an assortment of other stuff. I think it had rho as well. And it must have been topped with some eel sauce and this other creamy white sauce. I ordered so much, I don't remember what was in it. But i do remember that it tasted balanced and flavorful, and was simply the perfect bite. 5/5  Frying Jason - This is basically a BSCR but the filling had crab sticks and cream cheese. Pretty bomb. 4/5  Grilled Yellowtail Collar - this was also the bomb. you can taste the smokiness from the grill and the fish was light. it felt like you were eating outside your bbq. 4/5  I also ordered:   baked mussels (fantastic)  dynamite (basically the topping of a BSCR in a shell)  orgasmic salad (seared ahi tuna in some greens and lime juice. a bit sour)  jala jala roll (your basic roll with spicy tuna in the filling topped with albacore, salmon, tuna, and a slice of chili pepper....pretty good)  scallop nigiri (it was good, but he put a bit too much lime juice on it)  supreme salmon roll (probably my least favorite. it was a salmon roll topped with salmon. a little overkill)  Finally after all this indulgence, i finished off my meal with some green tea ice cream. delicious.   p.s. all the dishes i ordered can be ordered in half orders.",

Like a mini sample taste serving... the typical you get at normal sushi places but you can just order more.  Loved the grill calamari- it also comes fried if you want. They didn't have toro when we were there :(. Seaweed salad and garlic edamame were yummy as well. Salmon belly and uni was buttery. You must have the tuna over fried rice! There were times we ordered one serving and they doubled it. Then there were other times when we wanted a double order and they gave us one. Hmmmm...? Overall it was good $26.95 pp.",

    "text": "Dropped by this place for lunch on a Friday afternoon during Rock in Rio weekend. At first, the impression was bad: The wait took FOREVER. But we took it as a sign that it must be popular and, given its small size, it sort of made sense. The 45-min wait was also exacerbated by the fact that we were all starving. But we decided to stay and wait it out, and boy am I glad we did!  The AYCE offered so many choices, we were overwhelmed with the options, especially since our stomachs were eating themselves at the time. We decided to take it slow and order some rolls and nigiri first. Some of my friends got miso soup, and I got some gyoza. After the first orders came out fairly quickly, the deliciousness of the meal overtook us and we decided to go all out. We ordered enough to feed a family of 20.   Some notable dishes were the white tuna, cajun albacore, and seared salmon. I also love unagi/eel and this place did not disappoint. I think one of the best things about goyemon is that you can order HALF ORDERS. What!? Don't want a full 8-piece roll? Get a half-order! No more leftover sushi to shove down at the end. I'm not sure if other sushi places did this, but when the waitress offered it to us, I knew Goyemon cared about efficiency and possibly its customers' waistline.   The service was great. Although busy, the waitress was always around, and our waters were always refilled. We did not have to wait 40 min per order like some other sushi places. All in all, a great experience at AYCE sushi, and I can honestly say that I haven't had too many good AYCE experiences.   TL:DR - Had a long wait, but TOTALLY WORTH IT. Half-rolls galore!",

    "text": "***300th review***  AYCE sushi dinner for $27 is a steal especially when you're in vegas!  The sushi chefs are friendly, quick with your order, and use quality fish.  The only thing that I don't like about this place is that seating is very limited and expect to wait before you get a chance to sit down.  We came in on a Monday night and still had to wait about 10 minutes.   I definitely recommend getting 1/2 orders of all the rolls so you can try more without getting too full too quickly.  Since it is AYCE, it's your chance to try some of the more expensive items on the menu.  Just see what sounds good to you and order!  Some of my favorites were the pork belly, seared tuna, sexy girl roll and the rainbow roll.  I also tried the uni (sea urchin) since it's also apart of the AYCE menu and too expensive to order for me normally.  It's very interesting.... creamy and reminds you of the ocean.   Lastly, be careful of what and how much you order... if there are leftovers you will be charged the retail price of each item.",

I am more a nigiri person, sushi is about the fish not about jazzed up mayo or Teri sauce. Goyemon does have a impressive selection of nigiri for a AYCE.   They also do have great desserts and appetizers. I like it because no limit on dessert like some places.   They also have a black board that changes daily with specials that includes special fish of the day. On this day it was conch, konpachi, Bonita, jalepeno massage and negatoro. The conch nigiri so good.   On this day service was greatly improved with servers being really attentive to us. I have tried most of the major AYCE sushi joints in Vegas and no one can beat Goyemon on fish varieties and varieties of rolls, appetizers.  Only con is the long wait, usually 30 to 40 min wait. Very popular place and it's a small place. I've been in there at 1am and it's packed during mid week",

The place smelled like old fish, was dark, loud, and very crowded. Because I was so hungry, we left and went to her usual spot Umiya. Considering these places are all you can eat raw sushi joints, I'd rather be a bit more picky and eat at a more cleaner establishment. Even if it was the late lunch hour rush, the establishment should be clean and not smell like the kitchen if they're serving raw fish (my pet peeve). Dahmmit...I feel terrible for writing a bad review about this joint, but Umiya was just that much better and even a few bucks cheaper with the free drinks.",

Nigiris are fresh! You may be better off eating/ordering fresh fish rather than those fatty baked/deep friend rolls.   Pros: You can do half orders and unlimited desserts. Cons: Long wait, not good for groups (it'll be a longer wait)  Must go to for AYCE Sushi in Industrial Area.",

    "text": "Goyemon features a delicious all-you-can-eat sushi menu, but the service was a little off.  We came in on a Sunday night around 6 p.m., and were seated right away.  The nori/seaweed that they use here is SO flavorful and really adds to the sushi.  This is the only sushi restaurant I've been to in Las Vegas that used seasoned nori.  What's amazing about this all-you-can-eat sushi restaurant is that they don't force you to eat like 10 pieces of sushi per roll.  You can order half-orders, which is really convenient, especially on your first time!  Additionally, instead of charging you per piece you do not eat, you have a time limit.  We were not bothered by the time limit, as we were already full.  In fact, the server never even mentioned the time limit.  I ordered Garlic Tuna, Teriyaki Chicken Roll, Mahalo Roll (i.e. Spam roll), Crispy Rice, Spider Roll, Tamago, and a Rice Cracker, which was a special.  For sides, I ordered the fried gyoza, sesame chicken, seaweed salad, tuna poke, and a sashimi salad.  For dessert, I ordered three different flavors of mochi ice cream (no limits for the dessert like most AYCE sushi places either!).  The Garlic Tuna was amazingly fresh!  The sauce was a bit too lemony for my taste, but the fish was delicious!  I love crispy rice rolls, and it did not disappoint here!  I have to say that Spider was probably my favorite roll.  The soy paper was a nice touch and I loved the mix of deep fried soft shell crab and fresh crab meet.  I am a sucker for non-fish rolls also, so I would definitely recommend the Teriyaki Chicken and Mahalo Roll as well.  The sides were hit-or-miss.  The tuna poke and sashimi salad were not fresh at all.  The tuna poke was extremely disappointing and lacked flavor.  This was surprising considering how impressive the garlic tuna roll was.  The sesame chicken was also disappointing as it tasted undercooked and did not seem to have any sauce or seasoning on it (not even sesame seeds!).  The dessert, of course, was delicious.  The service was weird because our servers switched in the middle of our meal.  Thus, someone dropped the ball on our side dishes and we basically had to reorder it, but it did come out very quickly after we mentioned it to our new server.  The rolls came out pretty quickly (with a few exceptions), but at times it was hard to flag down our server.  Overall, both of our servers were friendly though.   I would definitely return to Goyemon, as it was one of the better sushi restaurants that I have been to in Las Vegas.  I am not quite convinced it is the best one in Las Vegas just yet though...",

But the food seemed oversold from everyone else's review. I had salmon most of the night and a sad creme brulee, the top wasn't even even cooked all the way. Unpleasant to the eye and displeasing to the appetite. 1/5",

If you can wait that long then you should expect for your food to come out so fast, that there is no freshness after a certain time because all your food coma out at once, and there is no time to pace yourself.

But when I get the chance to sit at the bar, \" TONY\" tears it up!!!  I tell him! \" I'm a Hungry Beast\" and he says \" no Problem, you little CockaRoach\" j.k.  He says, \" I got you! I give you the goods tonight!\" Since I love ALL sushi Nigiri Style hands down I trust tony gonna give me the goods...And he delivers with a BANG! So, I recommend sitting at the bar if you get a chance.  Why do I love the sushi here, well not only is it very fresh but it also has a Quality that is hard to find here in the city. I also like the portion to rice ratio because sometimes they give you more rice than fish and I really do not appreciate that.  I also like the side items! The Pork Belly is a delicacy here that I will never not have! Also the Spicy Tuna Cracker Rice is good!  mmmm... It's all good and I am just dreaming about all my favorite sushi here!! I like Mango for desert so they actually had a really nice Mango Mousse this last time that I went. I also like to look at there daily specials to make sure i'm taking advantage of the All You Can Eat!!!",

    "text": "I'm usually not a fan of AYCE restaurants.  Especially when it comes to Sushi.  Sushi Goyemon is the exception.  This is not your standard ACYE sushi affair.  You don't walk up to a station.  There are no lines.  Food does not sit out under a heat lamp.  Rather, you order what you desire from the menu at the comfort of your seat.  The menu here is extensive and consists of your standard sushi, sashimi, and rolls.  However, they also include a variety of appetizers, grilled items, specials, desserts, and more.  You may come here thinking that you'll get your value here only based on volume and how much you can consume.  Don't be fooled, their food here is delicious.  You'll get your value from quality as well.  Some of my favorites from the menu are; -  Sashimi Salad -  Seaweed Salad -  Super White Tuna Sushi -  Salmon Sushi -  Cajun Albacore Sushi -  Sunrise Roll -  Dragon Roll -  Sexy Girl Roll -  Volcano Roll -  Mochi Ice Cream  The atmosphere here is like any other typical casual Japanese restaurant.  Then again, you don't go to AYCE for the atmosphere.  Just be cautious of the long lines and wait when you arrive.  They don't accept reservations so expect a wait during peak times.   The price for dinner is $27 which seems fair amongst the competition in Vegas.  But given the amount I usually eat when I come here, I guarantee they're losing money.  It's one of the few places you can go in Vegas and leave a winner.  Come here for pure Japanese gluttony on great food.  You won't be disappointed.",

    "text": "I have found my new favorite AYCE sushi joint in Vegas now.  Before coming here, I was a fan of Yama Sushi, which is still really yummy, but now that I've been introduced to this place, I don't know...I think I might have to come here now rather than Yama.    We arrived with a party of  6 and the hostess told us it would take about an hour and 15 minutes or so.  The place is small with a main dining area and two larger tables to the side of the restaurant for larger parties.  We ended up waiting about 50 minutes or so, which wasn't too bad!  There are a few tables with chairs outside so you can sit back and kick it.    Now onto the food... portions of their nigiri are smaller than what I'm used to in regular sushi restaurants, however, I think it's the right portion because it's not overwhelming and it makes you want to order more.  Fish is fresh and delicious..melts in your mouth taste, which is awesome, rice on the nigiris, perfectly packed and does not fall apart when dipping into soy sauce, this alone deserves a single star.  Sushi rolls were amazing to taste and the the size of the rolls were pretty generous.  My favorite would have to be the spider roll and dragon roll.  I had to get two of the spider rolls because it was that good.  They made it fresh so the soft shell crab came out nice, warm and crunchy.  Price came out to be about $34/person, which is not bad depending on how much you plan on grubbin'!  When we come to sushi places where it's AYCE, we always try to get the bang for our buck.  I definitely can't wait to come back here on our next trip to Vegas.    Staff was friendly, food came out quick, prices are affordable for AYCE,  bathrooms are clean.  I really enjoyed my experience here!    Desserts...I had the vanilla mochi and it was nothing special.  I wish they had more flavors of the mochi rather than just vanilla and strawberry.  I could really care less about the dessert though cause really it's all about the sushi here.  Yummy in my tummy!",

    "text": "Even the best food and atmosphere can taste horrendous after lackluster service and poor response. Until the current manager changes the way he handles complaints, I give this place only five more years.  The restaurant was maybe 3/4ths full, so I was expecting faster service than the times I have been here when it was jam-packed full with a line out the door. Continuing, I looked over the menu (it has been redesigned), and I saw that the same favorites were in place: Braised pork belly, super white tuna, and cajun albacore. I started off the night with an order each of amaebi and uni for me and my boyfriend, and we also ordered two half rolls to start. The both of us chatted as we awaited our food, and the natto roll, amaebi, and the uni came out. I was pleased with the sweetness of amaebi and the freshness of the uni. \"So, I take it that the Calico roll is still on its way?\" After an affirmative, we placed a few more nigiri orders. For your reference, the Calico roll is not a deep fried roll: Just a few slices of fish in the middle and slices on top. Not a very time-intensive roll at all, so we were sure it will show up soon.  By the time we finished with our sushi, we continued to wait for the rest of our orders.  About ten to fifteen minutes pass, and it seems that the sushi still has not shown up, so we decided to order some braised pork belly and miso soup. That order came fast (within maybe five minutes), and we were glad to note that the portions were larger. However, one bite in, and the insides of the belly were frozen. Maybe there are some people that like their fatty meats cold, but I personally prefer it to be warm and melty. We brought this up, and after an apology they took this to the back. As a customer, you can see the sushi chefs working on their sushi, and you can see the grillmaster who does the grilled entrees and desserts. The waiter (we later learn he's the manager) and the grillmaster exchanged a few words, kept sneaking glares towards our table, and rather than getting right to cooking it, they stood there and chatted for a better part of a couple minutes. It didn't look like they wanted to fix the problem.  As this is going on, my boyfriend mentions that service seems to be slower than usual, and I cannot help but agree. I did point out to him, though, that if he would just sit at the sushi bar for once, we can get fish faster in general. Five minutes later, new pork belly arrived to the table. Blackened and charred on both sides. Well, this time they definitely made sure that it was warm on the inside. We scraped off the black charcoal and ate the belly.   We inquire about the status of the rest of our order. Our waitress replied, \"Oh, you haven't received it yet?\" \"No, we have not received it yet.\" She apologizes, we say it is fine, and we place a few more orders for their specials for the night, namely salmon pork belly nigiri. The rest of the orders filter in, including the salmon pork belly, but we had to reorder the orgasm sauce, the miso soup, and a few other nigiri because they lost the order. I contemplated over the service as I was savoring the fatty salmon belly. The rest of the orders showed around fifty minutes after we sat down.  My significant other declares that he's done, so I decide to follow suit. I note that in the course of the extended delays and mistakes, our table time has already reached the hour. They lost our orders for desserts, and I couldn't seem to reach anyone for a response. I note that the moment I place down my credit card, someone zips by quickly to pick it up. I asked for a comment card, but not having one, I wanted to speak to a manager about our experience.  She went to go see the manager, and I recognized him for helping out on the floor. He turns his back to chat with someone else for a while saw him shake his head, and decides to head over with our missing dessert orders. I thank him for bringing the dessert, though I brought up my main points, namely how service is slower than usual, and how our orders were messed up. He says a brisk \"My apologies\", and then he explains someone was out for the day and servers switched. I understood the first part. Yet, it was the same person who took our order from start to finish, so I asked if he was sure that was the reason why. To this, he retorts,  \"You see the people waiting outside at the door? Yeah, you can't expect everyone in here just to serve you.\"  Serious misunderstanding on his part, and he left me to fume silently. I do not like to go to places where I don't feel welcome, and while I won't judge a place based on the behavior of one worker, I will judge it based on the behavior of a manager. A place that can't take fair input graciously will only deteriorate over time.  I hope that when I return two years from now the management has changed. There ARE better AYCE in town, for cheaper, just as fresh, and faster. I'll be writing reviews for them as well.",

    "text": "Arguably one of the best AYCE sushi spots in Clark County, located south of the intersection of Decatur and Tropicana. Very nice setting and condensed so that service can be more closely-knitted. NOT.   This place had very high expectations and anticipation from me. Not only because of the amount of praise it generates but i is also the sister sushi-house of Sushi Mon which is located on Silverado Ranch Blvd and Maryland Parkway. However, based on what all my friends told me and all the yelp reviews, it seemed pretty decisive that Goyemon had an edge. Only for me to say HELL. NO.  I came here on a quiet Saturday afternoon with two friends who I picked up from the airport. We began with the classic yellow-tails and Volcano Roll. I understand that volcano roll can take a little while but really, 20 minutes...? Especially when there's maybe like 3/4 occupancy in the restaurant, you would expect much quicker. I mean, don't get me wrong, the quality of the roll was amazing, but to take 20 minutes is no justification. I'm a hungry guy, when I'm in an atmosphere such as AYCE, I'm there to be in for the kill.   Right after the Volcano Roll, I asked for the ecstasy and philadelphia roll. Note, everything I order is half rolls, not full. I like diversity over quantity. This time, it took somewhere from 10-15 minutes..... COME ON. These chefs are professional and I understand that they can be under duress but I'm SURE that this joint has been under far more pressure ever than by one single person with that being just me. How can it take nearly 40 minutes to make 3 half rolls???? I can run to the strip and back in that time. (Ok not really). Then I just ordered the sunrise and sexy girl rolls and after that, I was way too frustrated with the incompetency of the services so concluded with my mochi and green tea ice cream. And no, it's not because of the chefs. The table next to me which had one less person ordered rolls later than me and received them before me. Not to mention, they are FULL rolls. NOT HALF. If anyone can PLEASE give me a logical explanation for the terrible service, I will be happy to give you my stamp card which is at 10, making my next visit free.   Yet, for a tab at $70, my friends and I ended up paying $10 for service. Obviously they feel the need to tip just because they feel bad. But I don't feel bad. Feeling bad is for all the hungry kids around the world. Their terrible service may be explained that they like to stall me so that my stomach can process foods faster and make me full quicker. But that's why I'm here because I'm going to fight it if I have to. They may have done this so that my stomach can process the foods faster and to make me full quicker. Nevertheless, a business tactic that I don't appreciate because they don't appreciate my business.   Make no mistake, this review is subject to change because I do hope that they can make up for their stupidity. The food quality is the cream of the crop. But if they choose to fail me next time in serving me, I will pay the price and no tip. Then I'll never return, only to keep my commitment to Goyemon's sibling, Mon.",

Everyone was super friendly, the chef's clearly knew what they were doing, and did a great job keeping orders coming out with a pretty decent sized lunch crowd.  As for the food, it was great.  Nigiri was properly prepared with an excellent fish-to-rice.  Rolls were also great - we tried a bunch and didn't have one we didn't like.  One thing I really liked here was that they have some unique rolls that go beyond what you usually find at the typical AYCE place and all of the flavors meshed nicely.  I like spicey rolls and let me tell you, these folks put together some fine spicy rolls.  We also tried to apps - calamari and steamed shu mai and both were outstanding.  In particular, the shu mai seemed to be freshly prepared and did not taste or feel like it had been prepared from pre-made, frozen shu mai.    Overall, this is a great option for AYCE sushi and we'll be back regularly. And if you like you're meal, make sure you get a frequent diner card.  If you fill it in you can get a free AYCE meal.",

They also have an abundance of extra items outside of sushi and rolls. grilled pork belly w/ mango salsa was good, not great. the yellowtail collar was out of this world. the sauce that came with it was even better. Also, they include uni (1 order per person), bluefin tuna (1 order per person), and bigeye tuna with the ayce menu.   The only knock i have against this restaurant might be the time it takes for the food to come out. There was always a few people waiting for seats at this restaurant and i can see why. I suggest eating at the sushi bar.   O yea ayce desserts are included as well.",

Fresh, fast, and decent sushi without jamming too much rice in.  However, my first visit to Goyemon was after being referred here by a personal recommendation that my favorite sushi place was not as good.  And unfortunately I was not impressed at all!  Sushi on Rainbow is superior in every aspect except for the atmosphere.  But I was here for the sushi, not the fancy decor and it left me very unsatisfied.  The nigiri was wet, mushy rice with bland fish.  The rolls were prepared faster than a McDonalds burger and the lack of time and skill put into the rolls showed.  Their non-sushi stuff was good but again, thats not why I came here.  Very dissapointed!",

    "text": "First time here with my family for a late lunch. It was about 345pm on a Sunday. We were seated right away.  The server took a while to get our water and orders which was okay since we took a bit to get settled and seated.   Let's start out by saying. Customer service really makes or breaks a place no matter how good the food it.   My first impression of our server was that she did not want to serve us. She did not offer a smile. She was very monotone and moved about sluggishly. We had children with us (ages 5 and 3). We asked our server how much it would be for our 5 year old she said it would be the SAME AS THE ADULT for AYCE (What the heck!) and our 3 year old was going to be charged $3 for AYCE. Luckily there were lunch bentos that my 5r could have. Fortunately, my 3r loves tamago, so he definitely ate his share.  If you are at an all you can eat restaurant where you have to place orders and they have a maximum time limit (45 minutes here) your orders better come out quick and your servers should be quick.   Miss attitude was slow and her body language was so negative that we began asking other staff members to help us with our orders.   The food was excellent, my compliments to the chef. I really enjoyed the hamachi and wished that I could try their uni (dinner only).   Halfway through lunch my 3r had to use the restroom, so I took him to the women's rr. It was clean enough. I always like to leave a comment about rr in any establishment I am reviewing on Yelp. Dirty and cluttered restrooms are a pet peeve of mine.   Overall, I'll probably try to come back to sample their uni but I won't be back with my kids since they can't eat the Adult price worth of AYCE food. Oh and my tip to management, hire people who want to help people. If you're in the people business, you need to be a people person. Just being honest!   Oh and if you're the type of server to stereotype your guests or customers that you are serving, then you stereotyped the wrong family. We tip good for good service and better for excellent service.",

This happened in the first week of June 2018  I've been to goyemon countless time in last 6 yrs. I had bad times and good times here but overall I like their sushi for the price.  Today, we went for lunch and we ordered some items for the first round. So many items were missing and the half roll came out as a whole roll.... but I didn't mind so much at the time and there was a black out!!!!   The entire electricity turned off and an annoying skinny dark blond white girl came to us and said that they would have to close and they would charge us for half price..... She didn't even apologize or anything. She didn't even look sorry. She acted like as if she was doing us a favor!?!? Yes, it's not her fault but she could have at least showed her empathy to us. After she told us that, she immediately took her restaurant T-shirt off IN THE RESTAURANT while all the costumers were there and started to get ready to go home!!!! How inappropriate and unprofessional she was!!!!!   I was also  a little upset that they charged us for half price..... We didn't even get all the items from our first order.... and I was soooo hungry!!!! In fact, I had to go to a buffet after this tragedy. They even charged the full price for another customer who didn't get to his dessert yet!!! I don't think it's nice or they are honest! How they handled this black out really disappointed me and I don't think I would want to go back to goyemon at least for a while.... I've been so loyal to them and what they did was not so fair or nice....",

AYCE sushi that is actually good and satisfying your tastebuds and stomach without hurting your wallet.  There are many worse sushi places that are also more expensive than this place.    some of my personal recommendations:  - check daily special menu on board. you will often find better fish and other items that are not on the regular menu.  - if you are trying out something new, order half sized roll so that you dont end up filling yourself too much too quick.  - nigiri is small. its about 1/2 of typical size. you might want to order double if you expect regular portions.  - this place gets busy and often with long wait. plan accordingly or avoid busy hours.    - because its busy, sometimes take long time for your orders to arrive. anticipate this and order more in batches.  - if you are small group, sushi bar is a great choice - you might be able to cut through the wait and get a quick turn around on your sushi orders directly through sushi chef.",

Make sure you time yourself coz they make it a point that you have 60 minutes for AYCE.(rudely) On the 2 stars, fish is fresh but don't expect uni, they seem to never have it every time we're there. Take it off the menu to save you one more disappointment. Just a suggestion: Hire people that likes people. Employees just going through the motion, no happy emotions, negative vibe will always ruin a meal. I definitely will not be back, and this time I'm telling everyone not to patronize this business.",

The service is always great and you never feel rushed to finish.   I highly recommend the chubby roll and my Husband would definetly recommend the super white tuna, he always raves about it.  Things to note: It is pretty far off the strip so expect a drive.  Parking is abundant, so no worries there.  Be prepared for a wait, even right when they open there are already people waiting.  Bottom line, if you are looking for AYCE sushi, this is your spot.",

    "text": "We came here yesterday evening as a large party of around 20. Understanding that Goyemon usually doesn't take reservations we asked in advance if it would be possible for them to accommodate us and they said yes, they had a side room available for our size. Perfect! All they asked from us was to turn up at 8pm with the party, so we did. We waited. Firstly outside of the restaurant in the humidity as there were too many of us to wait inside. 20 mins into waiting, we were getting too hot, so were finally able to come in and waited down a slim corridor to the restrooms - inconvenient for all guests. 30 mins in, we were still waiting and at that point it dawned on a server to hand out some water. Grateful for this, however at this point we were getting a little impatient and definitely ready to sit, knowing that with a big party it would take time for us to order and receive food. ONE HOUR into waiting, 9pm, the host finally asks to speak to the manager who is not to be seen. Talking to the servers available near the room we are supposed to be seated at, there are still parties in there being served. Not near finished! We are pretty much ready to leave having consumed one cup of water when a server says that they are now setting up for us in the main restaurant and we are thankfully sat less than 10 mins later. After OVER AN HOUR WAITING with a party the restaurant knew were coming, we were sat in a tightly packed space in the restaurant but finally with some menus to order. Thankfully the servers were very quick with drinks and despite there being a lot of us, food came out rather quickly. I was definitely looking forward to the food, not just because I was starving but I was also hoping the restaurant would redeem their disorganisation with the quality of the food.  Unfortunately though, that was not to be. I ordered the Caterpillar roll which was very bland and both my partner and I thought the avocado on top was not very fresh to taste. The Moon roll was better and flavours could be tasted this time - an average tasting roll that filled the gap. Finally the spider roll - full of crab which was good, however the deep fried crab that came with it was so deep fried that you could only really taste the oil it was cooked in.  All in all, the initial disorganisation and over an hour wait for a party they knew were coming was disappointing. If they did not accept reservations and were not in a position to accommodate us for over an hour, they should have told us so. Finally, with so many excellent sushi establishments in the valley, we are looking for great flavours and fresh food, unfortunately I don't believe the food served here was anything more than average, so if it wasn't for the wait, this would be a 3 star review.  We won't be returning and I hope they are better organised for whoever tries them in the future.",

    "text": "Craved sushi and decided to eat some all you can eat sushi with some friends at Sushi House Goyemon. There are a couple of AYCE restaurants located around the valley. This one is no different, offering a variety of special rolls, nigiri sushi, baked rolls, appetizers, and other dishes including rice.  The food itself was not bad at all. I liked the taste. I usually order nigiri sushi and I felt like there was a bit too much rice in the sushi. The rice to fish ratio seemed a little off. However, the food is not the reason that I knocked off a couple of stars from my wedding......  Our first plate of sushi and drinks came by fast, which was a good sign..... at first. After eating the first couple of plates of sushi and apps, the service became increasingly slow. Waters even became slow to get refilled.",

    "text": "Goyemon is my favorite spot for ayce sushi :) It's waaay better than Sakana. I feel that the fish here is much more fresh and they have better nigiri. Sakana has a better fish to rice ratio compared to Goyemon but the quality of the fish at Sakana isn't as good as it used to be. I feel that they drown all their fish in sauce to cover up that it isn't as fresh.  I always stick to nigiri at ayce places since I don't really like baked rolls or rolls in general. I'm in love their salmon belly , super white tuna , eel , cajun albacore , amaebi (sweet shrimp) , and fresh scallop nigiri here. Their sashimi salad , vegetable/shrimp tempura , and garlic edamame are really good appetizers. Other ayce places don't really make tempura right but here it's on point. My favorite definitely has to be their dessert though. I love how there's ayce ice cream mochi , green tea & red bean ice cream , tempura ice cream , yuzu sorbet and creme brulee. Dessert isn't limited to one per person which is a big plus to me since half of what I eat is dessert anyways. If they had mini honey toast then it would be perfect.  The service here is alright. I used to work at an ayce place so I understand how hectic it can be. As long as the food here is excellent then this will still be my go-to place. Always get the dinner option over lunch (since more options available for only a few dollars more).",

    "text": "We spotted this place on Yelp after searching for an All-You-Can-Eat sushi restaurant in the area. This place had just opened for lunch on that morning, but it was almost filled to capacity with people seated at every turn. The sizable interior included a large sushi bar in the back, TV, and three rows of tables that spread across the floor. We were fortunate to snag one of the last tables that came with laminated menus. It took a while to get the server to come by our table, but the food was well worth the wait.  For $21.95 per person, the menu was extensive, and included a list of nigiri, hand rolls, specialty rolls, side dishes, and desserts. Among the nigiri, my favorites were the Fresh Snow Crab, Salmon, Seared Salmon, Scallop, Yellowtail, Halibut, Red Snapper, and Salmon Eggs with a Quail Egg on top. The quality of the rice was good with nice textures, and the sushi chef did an impressive job with ponzu and yuzu sauces to add excitable dimensions to the fresh fish. On the down side, the cuts of the fish were noticeably small, sloppy, and inconsistent between pieces. We were also initially disappointed at how small these pieces were, but this has allowed us to sample a wide range of specialty rolls.   In particular, I enjoyed the Red Dragon Roll that came with spicy tuna, cucumber, avocado, fresh water eel, and eel sauce on top. The sweet eel and avocado nicely intermingled with the spicy tuna. The noticeable crunch from the cucumber also rendered both freshness and texture.   The items to avoid were the Poke, as freshness and texture were both disappointing to say the least. Similarly, the Surf Clam Nigiri also lacked the profile to worth the calories. The Jala Jala Roll sounded good on paper--with chopped albacore, cucumber, avocado, salmon, yellowtail, and jalapenos--but it turned out dry and could use a sauce on top. The Crab Meat Handroll was also another item to avoid, as the imitation crab lacked the right sweet profile, and without a second filling, the flavor was insufficient to stand on its own.  Service was a hit or miss, and a bit rushed without taking into consideration that we were first time customers, and needed time to learn how to best orchestrate a meal that works for us. Overall, we had three rounds of sushi, and despite the shortcomings, we rolled out of the restaurant thoroughly satisfied. Interested diners can expect casual dining atmosphere, decent to good sushi, good value, but feeling a bit rushed given how busy this place can get. Good enough to warrant a strong 3-stars recommendation. We hope to return for a better experience when traveling in the area.",

The sushi was not fresh - they didn't even have the Wagyu/Kobe beef and the waitress wasn't very friendly. In fact, the she seemed really annoyed to be there. When I asked questions about the sushi rolls, she literally rolled her eyes!   Not only did I leave unhappy, I was so embarrassed how I hyped this place up to my friends. They weren't impressed either. It looks I won't be coming back here for a while. I hope they step up their game. Sigh. I guess I'm back to looking for a new AYCE sushi bar when I'm in Vegas.  The only good thing about this place is that the dessert (mochi ice cream) is AYCE.",

    "text": "Their selection of fresh fish is unmatched by any other sushi place I've been to here in Las Vegas. The price for their AYCE should be outlawed because it's so low for what you get. If you can sit at the bar and rest easy that you will be served by the brothers Gian and Andrei. I would say they are the best chefs there and they're the most hospitable. It had been a few months between visits and they totally remembered me.   This place is ALWAYS busy. So get in early or put your name down and get ready to hunker down.   It's all worth the wait - they have on their AYCE : Pork belly, Amaebi, Toro, and about 3 - 4 other rotating fish. The staff here is pretty good, some better than others. They also have fresh grated wasabi here too, it's worth the burn.   The rolls are ok, but as for me fish and rice only, leave the sauce at the bar.   If you love sushi and get that late night craving for Sushi, Check it out, but remember the key is to sit at the bar with Gian and Andrei.   ENJOY!",

The quality of fish has seriously gone down and well the bad service just makes it bad overall. At 430 there's a wait and you would expect it to be amazing AYCE with the wait. The scallop is drenched in lemon juice, the yellowtail was poorly cut, etc etc.   Overall really disappointed by the quality. I won't be back for a long while.  PS. I was in the bathroom for the rest of the night after that. =\\ I know that's one of the risks of AYCE sushi though.",

Nothing blew my mind but nothing was gross. it looks clean, our waiter wasn't like very outgoing or extra nice or talkative really at all lol but she wasn't rude and she kept up on our refills. I am completely stuffed, I wish I could give 3 and a half stars. I'd come here again. Unfortunately Sakana was my favorite sushi place but they were on dirty dining, which broke my trust so I can't go there anymore. But I like this place better than Yama. I'm satisfied, it was good. I'll probably come back.",

I like that they have pork belly in a pineapple glaze and they have a special's menu you can order from as well. And you can also get udon. They're sometimes packed and theres a wait but they are open late so not a problem. Service from the servers is just okay in my opinion. They get the orders in and food out asap but they don't really have any personalities. But it is what it is and as long as they keep the food coming no big complaints from me. I still like eating there and will recommend it.",

    "text": "This place has officially taken the Number 1 spot on my Top AYCE sushi restaurants. So congrats Goyemon!  After reading reviews I knew the wait was inevitable. This place is small! Very small space. Which explains the wait time. We got there and it was about a 35 minute wait but they do grab your number and text you when your table is ready. The text even says if you need a few minutes reply back and they'll wait 2 minutes. So don't wonder too far.  Automatically when we sit down someone takes our order. They must know the wait made us extremely famished! Ordered so many rolls (as seen in my pictures). I am a half roll kinda girl. I love getting half so I have more room to try different rolls.   Some of my favorites were: Sunrise Roll- This roll had cajun albacore (my fav), cucumber & avocado inside and its wrapped in tuna, yellowtail, shrimp, and white fish! I mean thats an amazing combo of fish. It taste so good!   911 roll- Seriously the spiciest roll out there hands down. When we got it I thought, wow what a simple roll but boy I was wrong. It's spicy tuna with habanero sauce. Now I've had sushi rolls with habanero sauce before and it was NOT as spicy as this roll. This had my mouth on fire.... but in a good way!   Nigiri- Very fresh! The garlic tuna was to die for. And of course my favorite Cajun Albacore!   Spider Roll- Very large roll of sushi wrapped in soy paper and not seaweed. Might need to bite it twice to finish. Very amazing flavors of the soft shell crab inside. BOMB!   I honestly loved every single roll I tried. I wanted to keep eating but my stomach would't allow it. The presentation of the rolls and different colors of the fish used was beyond beautiful. I love when my food not only taste amazing BUT looks amazing. Even if I ordered half rolls of everything-- it looked just the same as if it was a full roll.   service was great! Thanks for a great experience Goyemon! See you for dinner next time for that green tea cream bruele !",

Not sure if this was the best way because we still ordered a hell of a lot. Lol  Shrimp tempura- nice and light, it's hard to get this wrong.   yellowtail with jalapenos- the sauce it sits in sets it off!!!  Spider roll- it will be an unattractive challenge to try and fit the whole thing in your mouth but it's worth it!  Tiger roll- delicious.   Green mussels- although my date was hesitant in trying due to the name... But he did anyway and ate most of the order. Says it all  Cucumber salad- definitely his portion that I tried. It's ok... Probably would be great if I liked cucumbers. Lol  Yakatori- perfect chicken skewers. It comes with 3 and I was lucky to still one before he ate the plate!   For dessert we share tempura ice cream!   All in all service e is good and food is great!",

The masago with quail egg was sloppily put together and a mess.  The 9-1-1 was INCREDIBLY spicy so if you order that prepare yourself for the spiciest roll I've ever had.  The puffy roll was decent. The garlic edamame had little to no flavor just covered in grease.  The service was mediocre it took forever to get water or tea refills and I had to sit with empty water for 30 mins.  I try any new sushi place with an open mind and this one fell short for me. I prefer Koma and JJANGA to this place for sure.  It wasn't the worst sushi but it wasn't very good either.",

    "text": "My bf and I went here after Wet n Wild so we were famished. It was my second visit here and he insisted this place is his close second favorite location for AYCE sushi in vegas. The last time we were both here was last year.  It was around 4 so we just missed the lunch rush and were happy we didn't have to wait too long for seats plus salmon belly was on special, yummmm.  What we liked: Miso soup: the bf said this was one of the best part of the meal, and it was the first thing he had. I'll take his word for it.  Spider roll: wrapped in soy paper. Great texture and crunch from the crab which was perfectly fried and the filling was nice and balanced. Wasn't overly saucy either.   Salmon belly: ordered it once and it wasn't a really good cut. Then ordered again later and it was perfect. Great big fatty slices of salmon belly that I made sure to savor. ---- The meh: Udon soup: bf ordered this as the ending to his meal. it was really just the noodles, broth and green onions, which was written in the menu but I kind of wish some veggies or meat was in there..   Super white tuna: I LOVE super white tuna but the one here was not succulent and melt-in-your mouth as I know it to be. There was no sauce whatsoever. Or maybe I missed it lol.. just okay.  Yellowtail: very small cut of fish! But still managed to taste a little above average. Was better than the salmon we first got for sure.. ---- What we didn't like: Pork belly: great presentation and meat looked appetizing as in had great char and color. Sadly the flavor really was not there and both slices had large flab of fat right down the middle that was just too unedible. I love pork belly and fat but after eating one slice and forcing the fat down, I couldn't do with getting the other fat glob down.  Sashimi salad: I did not know the crab mayo stuffing from a typical cali roll would be considered \"crab meat\" or sashimi for that matter. Yep, they layered this right atop the cubed sashimi pieces and there was a fairly good amount of it more than the actual sashimi. Still ate the whole thing cause had to..   Takoyaki: does not come dressed with sauce, mayo, aonori, green onions or furikake that should be on top. The two fried balls come with just the sauce on the side to dip. The inside was very mushy and had on or two tid bits of octopus. At least the outside was crunchy and there were some octopus inside..  mochi ice cream: we got red bean and strawberry. The menu only said they had vanilla and strawberry so I picked strawberry. Bf got red bean and I was like \"they have red bean???\". Table next to ours ordered a green tea one and again I was \"???\" But I stuck to my choice. They came out like flat disks lmao. And the mochi had some ice crystals and was not very elastic and chewy. As the ending to my meal, totally disappointed and would probably have gotten better mochi aisu from a grocery store but hey, it's ayce. --- Server was nice and checked up on us regularly. But service of food did take some time from time to time. Only once did the runner mistakenly bring one of our orders to the table next to ours but realized and brought it to us. They missed my one order of mackerel and I didn't bother to try to reorder it. And instead of getting the cucumber salad, they brought us seaweed salad which was still okay and we didn't bother to get it corrected either.  Overall, we left kind of unsatisfied. The cuts of sushi were pretty small and thin compared to other earlier pics on yelp. Maybe it's hit or miss or based on the chef behind the counter? Quality wasn't that great either. Bf  agreed it wasn't how he used to like it. I honestly don't think I will be back..",

    "text": "After the epic meal in the tatami room hosted by Tony T. (see my review for the event), Eric R. bugged me to return here for dinner.  We arrived on Saturday around 7 and were seated immediately at the bar.  The AYCE is an amazing deal, as it includes the specials on the daily special board, grill items, salads, rolls, nigiri, and all sorts of other things.  Some of the new things I tried included the grilled tofu which was quite tasty and amaebi shrimp head miso soup.  The shrimp were a bit harder to eat since they were not fried, but the flavor of them in the broth was good.  The mackerel was cured wonderfully.  Since we were at the bar, we had a nice view of the crazy action here.  We were taken care of by 4 different sushi chefs, and it took me awhile to even start a conversation with Chef Jun, a real Japanese chef yay!, in front of us.  However, the biggest disappointment is the rice.  Sushi is all about the rice.  The volume of this restaurant is huge because of the crowds, and the rice is not acceptable for sushi rice.  First of all, it was HOT.  I am talking just made, no cooling/fanning and hardly any vinegar/seasoning.  HOT rice with ice cold fish tastes bizzaroooo.  It ruined the meal.  I noticed the first time we ate here that the nigiri slices were all out of whack.  Because of the volume, the slices are not cut with precision but with speed.  I watched the chefs cut awkward nigiri slices that barely covered the hot rice.    Eric R. asked Chef Jun about the rice.  He said they have such a demand that they just use hot rice, and he apologized because he knows it is just like sushi faux pas 101...most sushi restaurants I have been to make rice in advance.  As someone who learned how to make the rice from a local Japanese market recently, I know that it requires 45 minutes to an hour of fanning and cooling prior to serving, and that is for my small batches (3 cups at a time).  Though there is a lot of variety and I have no complaints about the service or quality, I could never enjoy hot rice touching cold uni or cold amaebi or cold hamachi...you get the idea.",

    "text": "Was up in Vegas all last week and a friend recommended this place for all you can eat sushi for about $26 and this place was probably one of the best recommendations to go for sushi. First of all, they close at 3am so you can go ahead and carb load late at night. Haha. I had a variety of sushi rolls and did not disappoint at all. For what you get and what you pay is totally worth it. Only problem is that I would recommend is order as you go because it can get really confusing when the orders come out and you end up eatting your friends sushi cause they put it on the same plate as yours. So order one thign at a time and keep track of what you order. But great place for some sushi.",

The piece of fish is actually bigger than the rice. 3) pork belly, melts in your mouth. Seaweed salad is delicious (different than most restaurants, awesome seasoning added)  If you're daring, take a shot of ponzu with quail egg   My only issue would be that the place is really small so you'll definitely be on a wait. But it's so worth it! I've been to this place 5 times since I first discovered it. Definitely my new favorite spot.",

However the place is so worth it.  First things first, if you're not doing AYCE then there is no point coming here. Other than that if you got a big appetite and looking to satisfy your craving for Japanese sushi then this is the place to go! Everything here is really good. If you're into the Nigiri sushi, you have to definitely order the SUPER white tuna, Cajun albacore, seared salmon, sea urchin....ahhh whatever just order everything!!!! Also if you like ramen you should come here after 11pm since that is when it is added to their menu.   I love this place! I'd give it five stars if it wasn't for the long wait times.",

Maybe it was the fact that we had such a big group that the gratuity was automatically added on already, but the server was inattentive and rude. After we were finally seated, we were left alone for at least 10 minutes, no drinks at all, until my friend had to go and flag someone down. How do you forget that big group of people who just got seated!? And even throughout the meal, it was difficult to find someone to order extra, and when a friend wanted to order more, the waiter actually said, with attitude, \"really? You want to order more? But you have more food coming.\" It's AYCE for a reason, and if he wanted to order more and satisfy the glutton in him, he could.   Overall a very disappointing experience.  Though the food itself was amazing, there are many sushi restaurants in town that are just as good, and they offer better service than Goyemon.",

I should note that no one else got food poisoning except for me, but nonetheless I have never gotten this sick after eating sushi before and I eat it quite a bit.    I would recommend checking out Sushi Kaya. I have never gotten sick after eating there and it is very comparable if not better.",

It was one of my favorite spots for affordable sushi.  But I came today and was surprised to be seated right away. I guess other people must agree that the quality has really dropped like crazy, because I don't ever remember being seated right away. The rice just tasted like mushy overcooked white rice. I seriously doubt they did any seasoning of the rice. But looking around no one really ordered nigiri sushi so I guess they don't care about making quality sushi. It's too bad. But for the price it's still ok. Just not worth any special trip like before.  So sad",

I love eating and sushi is my favorite food so I cannot pass up eating at all the sushi places in las vegas.   This place is one of the more top notch sushi places that I have been to with fresh fish. I am more of a nigiri man myself which is why I speak about the freshness of the fish. It is very important to me to have fresh fish. The texture of these fish are amazing and have the taste that you expect to come from such fish such as salmon and tuna.   The sushi rice is also of great texture. Sticks together still in your mouth like it's supposed to. I use my fingers to eat my nigiri and the residue left behind from the rice is minor which tells of great rice.   The reason for the 4 stars is because if the quality and presentation of the nigiri. The sushi could look better. I usually like to appreciate the food before me but there doesn't seem to be anything pretty about this fish but again this is not that big of a deal.   This is a great place to go for beginners of sushi. Goyemon has a lot of menu items that anyone of all sushi levels can enjoy. The quality of fish is amazing and can be enjoyed as raw fish or in a roll. Enjoy!",

    "text": "Brought my parents here on Mother's Day for AYCE lunch. Service was friendly and efficient; food was delicious & fresh!  Not sure if you can make reservations, but we didn't. Our party of 3 was quoted a wait time of 20 mins which I felt wasn't too bad for a holiday weekend. They take down your cell # and text you a link where you can check your place on the wait list. When it's almost your turn, they'll text you again and you can respond whether or not you'll be taking your spot -- great feature IMO so you can leave the restaurant and wander around (though there's not much to walk around in the plaza). If you choose to leave, at least you can text them back to let them know you won't be coming back for your table so it doesn't clog up the line for others.  We ordered more appetizers and nigiri than rolls, but everything we ordered was delivered quickly and tasted fresh! Rice to fish ratio was fairly small and although they state a time limit, it was never enforced. Service was great - our server came back multiple times to check up on us, take more orders, and refill our water/hot tea (complimentary). They do half rolls here in case you can't finish a full one and there is no limit on desserts! Order the lychee sorbet - it's yum!  We frequent Goyemon's sister restaurant Sushi Mon as it's closer to our house, but we'll be coming back to Goyemon from now on for AYCE since the fish is more fresh and service is more attentive and friendlier!  Also, make sure to get a stamp card! You get 1 stamp for every AYCE purchased and a free AYCE after 10 stamps. Make sure you don't lose your card as they do not combine cards & cards expire after 1 year. This card is valid at Sushi Mon as well.  Finishing touch: all moms in the restaurant received a long-stem red carnation on Mother's Day :)",

When we DID finally get seated, the wait staff came to get our drink orders quickly and delivered our drinks quickly as well. Since the 2 kids in our party looked like they were about to have a melt down, our server was quick to bring out their food first. Which all of the adults were appreciative of. The majority of the rest of the party had the AYCE and only 2 ordered separate meals. But by the time it was all said and done, everyone was eating off each other's plates and no one said a word. The various servers constantly checked on us for drink refills, food refills and then finally deserts; which we also got seconds and thirds of. Food as with previous trips was excellent. What they could improve on would be making sure that customers who are waiting outside are checked on, offered waters during the hot summer months. Also, they should consider taking reservations for parties of 6 or more.",

While some places limit what you can get on the menu or overload your rolls with rice, this place does the exact opposite. The sushi AND appetizers/starters are included in their AYCE menu, and they have a great selection of unique starters and specials. (Their Spicy Tuna Rice Crackers are a must!!) They have a good selection of speciality rolls, and each roll comes with plenty of fish. The $27 price is competitive for the quality and quality. I just wish I had enough room in my stomach to try everything, but I'm definitely coming back!",

Luckily, one lone spot at the sushi bar was calling out to me.   Everything I tried was good (except for the uni... but I'm just not a fan of it).  Grilled pork belly - Amazing! One of the best pork belly dishes I've ever had... succulent, juicy, tender, crispy edge, perfect amount of fat... It comes with a mango salsa, but it doesn't need it at all. Eating the pork by itself is the way to go.  Uni - I'm not a fan, but wanted to give it another shot since I've only had it a handful of times previously. After trying it here, I still don't like it. It was too salty and texture is not the least bit appealing.  Tuna nigiri - fresh, bright, silky texture, not too much rice.  Moon roll - eel, scallop, tempura flakes. Excellent roll, the eel took a backseat to the distinct flavor of the scallop. And, they didn't over-sauce the roll allowing the flavors of the main ingredients to shine.  Orgasm salad - Didn't quite live up to it's name, but still delicious. Nice bit of heat with the spicy chili sauce.  Spicy tuna crispy rice - Loved the crispy rice and the tuna was excellent. Each piece is big and it comes three to an order.  Hamachi nigiri - Wonderfully fresh, generous cuts of fish. The slices of fish were so big I couldn't even see the rice it was sitting on.  Tofu cheesecake - made in house, this dessert was incredibly rich and creamy.  The service and experience at the sushi bar was great. Chef Fredo took time to talk to everyone and explain the menu even though he, and the other chefs, were slammed. This is one off the strip sushi spot not to be missed.",

    "text": "Facts: dinner AYCE option 26.95 open til 3 am, limit on Uni(sea urchin) and Amaebi(sweet shrimp) of 1 order (2 pieces) per guest. Also includes cooked items and dessert.  I guess the more recent reviews reflect the how things are now at Goyemon.  Thinner fish on the sushi, less quality,  and as for the service it's a craps shoot.   Some waiters are slow but I can see they are trying, so when I see that, no problem.    One of my first job was as a manager at Nobu NYC so I am a sympathetic diner who know how hard restaurant staff work.  What ruined my experience are some of the Japanese sushi men (not the Hispanic sushi guy, who was efficient and pleasant) who seem visibly annoyed and condescending when you ordered after the first round. Worst is the cuts of the fish drastically got worse.  I wish I didn't see these things (job hazard).    Bottom line: AYCE carry their limitations.   To maximize your experience at Goyemon , sit at the tables and allow a few errors to the hard working waiters.  If you must sit at the bar, hope that you get the Japanese man with glasses or the young Hispanic man. Bon sushi!",

Even though they have a time limit, Japanese people are just way too polite to try and enforce that. While We waited the 1 1/2 hours for our table, I could tell that there were people who had definitely exceeded their time limit and still continued ordering and eating.",

Firstly, after waiting 35 min we were told we could be seated in the VIP room as soon as the rest of our party was here, as long as they arrived within 15 min. They did and then when we walked inside they had given our table away. Once we were finally seated, each order took extremely long to arrive and our server disappeared for 15-20 min at a time. With a 60 min limit on ordering, that was pretty inconvenient. Every time they did bring food over they basically slammed it down in front of us and walked away not caring where it went or even trying to just place it in the middle of the table The sushi wasn't the best I've ever had and with this kind of service I wouldn't come back.",

He not only exceeded my expectations, but went above and beyond to make dining here a great experience! Chef Hieu is very knowledgeable with fish. He did a great job explaining the tastes and textures of the fish to help make my decisions on what to order. Chef Hieu was a very polite, helpful, and funny guy. What makes him a great chef is he listens to your likes and dislikes to make recommendations to you and they were phenomenal. The food was AMAZING! Don't forget to try the lychee ice cream! It's delicious! I will definitely be coming back not only for the amazing food, but because of the exceptional customer service I received from Chef Hieu.",

Unfortunately, last night will be the last time I will be eating there. I mostly eat Nigiri, and it has, apart from a few times, been fairly consistent. The rolls have been alright, but like I said, I'm not that big on rolls. The service however, has worsened every time. Last month, my girlfriend waited for 45 minutes for her rolls, suffice to say, sheer had a horrible experience. Like the loyalist I was, I was able to convince her to give it a second try. We were able to order two rounds before the server just forgot about us. She never came back to refill our drinks and take additional orders. We had to beg another server for our check so that we could leave. We waited for 45 minutes.",

The usual assortment of Nigiri and Rolls but also a few unique items. They have deep fried rolls and seared salmon. Very tasty. Try the Pork belly or the Cajun Salmon, Cajun spice and Chili sauce that is sweet and wonderful.  The staff is very friendly, and will make you feel at home.  It is so good that you should be prepared to wait for a table. But then again, if no one is in a place, that speaks volumes.  Located on Decatur and the 215 South, near Hacienda.",

We actually boycotted this place but decided to go back because it was close to where we live. We walked into the restaurant sat for 20 minutes waiting for a table during lunch time. Although all the tables were 2 tops and we were 2+ a baby we were never acknowledged. However 2 people walked in and were immediately assisted. When I approached the waitress/hostess she said well you guys are a party of 3. Wow....I actually gotten way better service at fast food restaurants before. Restaurant is decent but I'm not going bother spending my money there with that kind of service.",

I WAS coming here twice a week for about a month.  PROS:  Open late with a last call at 2 am.  Super plus seeing how my boyfriend doesn't get out of work until 1 on the weekends and my work schedule is just all over the place.  Reasonable prices for the quality of food.  I like that they have an AYCE option even though we always ordered a la carte.  My one peeve:  After ALL the times I had frequented this place in such a short period of time....my boyfriend heads in with his family for dinner.  It was a party of 5 and 4 of them ordered AYCE... my boyfriend ordered a sashimi platter because he wasn't in an AYCE mood.  The server watched him like a hawk.... the ENTIRE night.  Long story short, my bf is a bit of snob when it comes to service so now.... he won't go back in there.  Sad face for me.  Aside from that.... My favorite roll is the Hurricane roll. Sesame chicken (karaage) is pretty good.  Goyemon was all about convenience for me... :( pretty bummed that I can't go back",

The nigiri here has the perfect distribution of rice and raw fish.  They have your normal rolls here but nothing that really stands out in flavor. But I like to order my favorite rolls and they are good here: Rainbow, Spider, and Stacey Roll.  They are the perfect size, fresh, and yummy.  They have all your normal sides as well, but the one that is special and unique here is the pork belly.  It's fatty but tasty and a pretty good portion.  Their baked mussels are a little over cooked here, but I like it a little burnt.  My friends did not appreciate it though.  They also have a better variety of desserts than other AYCE sushi places I have been to and they are also AYCE and you aren't just limited to one so that is definitely a plus.  This place has a super long wait if you come at prime times.  Come right at 5pm and you will get here before the dinner rush!",

I loved Goyemon after I became disappointed with Sushi Mon (Silverado Ranch and Maryland Parkway) quality several years back.  Plus all the employees i like there transferred to here.   The last couple times i've been there I have been really disappointed.  The place seems to be adding way to much rice to their rolls and the fish wasn't that fresh.  To add to that I feel the service part has really gotten bad.  I can never get someone to refill my drink, take away the empty dishes, or take my order.  I know the wait is always long, but after waiting that long i would expect some service.  I think i'm over Goyemon for awhile.",

    "text": "The sushi is pretty good for what my opinion is worth. I usually eat the stuff that has been either baked or cooked in some way because I'm a loser (or so I've been told by various companions of mine at sushi restaurants). As far as being Paleo friendly, I don't think you can get much better than fresh fish, kelp, and some white rice. Skip the soy sauce (contains gluten!) and the mayo-based sauces and you're golden.  It's expensive, like all other sushi restaurants, and I'm skeptical of the quality of their fish for that price like I am with all other sushi restaurants, but given that it tastes so good I'll give it the benefit of the doubt.   The only real problem I have is that given the price of the all-you-can-eat, I feel like I have to eat at least 3 rolls to break even so I always leave there feeling like I've eaten way more than I should!   (To clarify, I prefer wild-caught fish over farmed fish, but they make no mention on the menu or anywhere else about the sourcing of their fishes, and when I asked the waitresses didn't know. Wild-caught fish would be worth the price and I wouldn't call them too expensive. Farmed fish is not worth the price, and if that's what they use then they're too expensive.)",

    "text": "This is definitely one of my favorite Sushi places on the West Side! And I'll tell you why.   I'm a big fan of AYCE Sushi, whereas my friends are more into individual rolls at really nice Sushi places-almost Sushi snobs. Now I love individual rolls as much as the next guy, it's just I can't afford to always pay for 2 or 3 individual rolls, knowing that the bargain hunter in me wants to take an establishment for all it's worth when AYCE is involved. I love being able to sit for a long time, and take my sweet ass time ordering Sushi and the sides to my hearts content.   I would totally eat here for lunch, except I only have 45 minutes for lunch, and I like to take my time eating sushi, nigiri,sashimi and Side dishes. So I save Goyemon for times with my friends who like to chow down too. And Yes, AYCE places do have a tendency to have slightly lower quality per roll, but-knowing that you just ate about $100 of sushi for a mere $26.95(dinner) or $21.95 lunch- brings a smile to my face every time! I'm happy eating grocery store sushi, so I'm not picky...and Yes I do know what amazing sushi tastes like.  I do love there open seven days a week, I do love the courteous and prompt server girls that barely speak any english, and I do love the fact that there is almost nothing on the menu that is off limits, some piece do however have a limit of 1, or 1 per order.   I like to go in with a totally empty stomach, which can be bad at times if you don't like to wait. Usually the wait at Goyemon is about 15-25 minutes depending on what night of the week. One drawback is that it's a pretty small sushi place as far as sushi places go, and the bigger the group the longer the wait due to the limited though intimate space. Take note that if you waster food, they WILL charge you for excess waste-which is pretty standard in most places.  Another thing you can do is order the next round as you get an order placed in front of you. I like to do a sampler of a little bit of everything, but some of my best friends go straight for the jugular skipping any roll with rice and ordering Nigiri & Sashimi (Unagi, Salmon, Tuna, and Urchin) plate after plate after plate. My personal favorites are the Volcano Roll (baked YUM!) The Dragon Roll, and Salmon Roe.  One of the things I did notice is that if you order the most expensive stuff on the menu over and over, it comes out very quickly at first, and as each order goes in, they take more and more time to get it out to you.  But, seeing how there's no time limit...you've got time to spare! ;) Also, if it's your first time there, sometimes you'll space off and not realize a roll is 8 pieces, so if you want to try everything, ask for a 1/2 roll (4 pcs) so you can pick two rolls at a time.  On top of it all, you get a cool little atmosphere, great for hanging with friends, and nice hustle and bustle by the staff, and round it all out with dessert (I love the Red Bean Ice Cream!) and leave a fat & happy Buddha belly!  I love bringing people here! Be sure to check out the awesome sword in glass in the wall in the men's bathroom!  Cheers!  ~MikeB",

When we entered the restaurant there was a wait and the hubby and I were afraid it was gonna be awhile since the place was packed. It was just our luck that there was a table available for 2. (I guess everyone waiting were big parties.. Lucky us) Anyway, we were surprised that. This place offers AYCE Sushi. Which of course we had. The sushi was delish!!

    "text": "Probably my favorite sushi bar in Vegas, which happens to be one of the most popular. So, first off, be ready to wait for a table.   Once you're in, the place is small, but well utilized to fit as many people as possible. The service is fast and accommodating. The entire place is nicely designed and edgy for an off-the-strip sushi place.   All food has been stellar here, but I'm not a sushi snob, so it's hard for me to be disappointed. For being popular, it's quite the treat to see they offer AYCE, which I get every time.  One of the best oddities of Sushi House Goyemon is that it's open until 3 a.m. Since I have late dinners, this is very accommodating.   All in all, with the solid food, great hours, and ambiance makes it one of the best choice for Vegas locals.",

I'm pretty sure theirs was thrown in the deep fryer, which is not the way real Takoyaki is made.  It's also more mochi-like (sticky rice) rather than batter pancake-like & didn't come with the white sauce, mayo or usual garnishes.  The caterpillar roll came out looking like sloppy.  Definitely not $10 worth.  The rolls we got overall tasted decent/average.  The sesame chicken was so dry and flavor less, I had to ask for teriyaki sauce to drizzle over it.  The Green Tea Brulee was so small, the pictures are deceiving, it didn't have a hard shell on top, but it tasted great. I probably won't be going back there again.  They have a lot of competition in this town, if you know what I mean.",

If you've never been to an AYCE sushi place before, you basically can keep ordering appraisers, nigiri, sushi rolls or dessert from the menu until you are full. The sushi quality was 8/10 imo. But for AYCE, that's awesome!!  Nigiri was thankfully more fish and less rice. Gyoza, garlic edamame and mochi ice cream were all A+. What a great value for money. Usually for $22, you can order maybe 2 rolls at a sushi place or maybe a nigiri platter, here it's just so much more. Would highly recommend this place!",

The quality of the fish for AYCE is one of the best I've ever had.  They are very busy most of the time, but I've never felt like the wait staff has ignored me.  They are always very nice and the sushi comes out as fast as we order it.  My favorite part is they have daily specials of sushi such as masago jalapeno and salmon belly, which is SOOOOOO good.  If you go, I would suggest always try something from that list, as it is fresh and different.  If I had to give a con, I'd say that the bathroom facilities have gone downhill over the years, and there are a lot of things in the wrong place or broken.",

The service is pretty bad, and even downright rude at times, but just grab any waiter walking by and place your next order or get your drink filled. If the review was just for the service, I'd only give this place one star. But the 4 stars are for the price, variety of menu options, speed and quality.  Here are some of my fave menu items: - Sashimi salad - Miso soup with shrimp heads - Fried shrimp heads - Garlic edamame - Pork belly **one of the best I've ever had! - Rice crisps **wasn't sure about this, but ended up ordering 3 more plates of it! DELISH - Cajun salmon **check out their chalk board for specialty items.  - Cajun anything!  - Superwhite  All of the rolls were fresh and none of them were overloaded with rice. The dessert menu is by far the best I've seen on any AYCE menu. The mochi and green tea ice cream were sooo good! They even have chocolate mousse, just the perfect ending to a great dinner.  You may have to wait if you come with a group of 5 or more, and they stop seating at 2am, so make sure to get there with enough time. This is quickly becoming a local hot spot!",

At first, severe nausea and uncontrollable vomiting occurs.  Next phase comes watery diarrhea for 12 hours. If we didn't eat activated charcoal to stop further toxic absortion, we might have went to an ER. Please be aware of this place, aside from their horrible service, their food is dangerous.  One important thing I want to mention is their menu item \"Super White Tuna\", also known as Escolar (White Tuna) according to wikipedia. It is known to be toxic and banned by Japanese government!!!!   But don't you worry, they serve it right  here for us who do not know.

Nice atmosphere, decorating, lighting, outside seating, and open till 3am, are some of the selling points, but their fish pieces are small, sushi rice was borderline and their sashimi salad was a sad excuse.

Ive never seen this item at other sushi bars, but after eating their sushi i understand why they added it to the menu.... I suspect it's their only reason for success.",

It is a short drive from the strip, but way more worth it than other overpriced restaurants on the strip.  I highly recommend getting their fresh nigiri, but if you are in a big group, make sure to order reasonable amounts at a time since ordering too much at once will slow down your order significantly. Their rolls are very good too to go well with the nigiri. You WILL feel VERY VERY full after eating lots of exceptional sushi, but everyone has a second stomach for deserts, right? Their lychee sorbet will cleanse your palates as well as make your day better. This is a MUST stop for any Vegas trips",

First off we got here for lunch so some items on the menu are not included in the lunch menu. If you do get it, you have to pay the dinner price for AYCE. I wanted to try the pork belly but it was only for dinner.  Also, you have to make sure you don't overeat. You will be charged for anything you do not eat. Even if you order a nigiri and just eat the fish off of it and leave the rice, you will be charged for the rice leftovers! With that warning, my friends and I were cautious only ordering small amounts at a time. We did pretty good as the portions for the sushi items were not that big and when we order we ordered for the whole table instead of individual servings.   The highlight for me was the super white tuna! It was really tasty! I would love to come back here for dinner but would want to come here early as I hear the wait could be as long as 2 hours!",

First off, Freds, the amazing sushi chef that took such great care of us when we'd go in for lunch, it no longer working for Goyemon.  We enjoyed having Freds make us surprise rolls as we devoured nigiri, and he was a GREAT conversationalist. I have yet to experience the same type of friendly customer service from the other chefs that work during the lunch hour.   More importantly is the waitress service. The first time they forgot our edemame it wasn't a huge deal because, like I said in my original review, that's just more room for more fish. But this last time, I actually DID want to munch on some edemame as we waited for our food. What reasonable excuse is there for it to take over 20 minutes to get some damn edemame at a sushi joint? None.   Drinks were slow to get refilled, plates were slow to be bussed. I understand that the space behind the sushi bar is limited and so it's difficult to have more then 2 sushi chefs working, which can sometimes result in the sushi coming out slow. The management at Goyemon really needs to either hire more wait staff, or better train the ones they do have, because a great sushi eating experience should not be soured by slow and inefficient waitresses.   Goyemon, I still like you but if you keep this up, I am going to have to find a new spot to fill my urges for raw fish. :(",

    "text": "Like a few Yelpers before me who mentioned the parking situation in this plaza being quite deceiving... We pulled up on a Saturday night at exactly 6pm. I was like, \"No cars, shouldn't be packed.\" I walked inside to find a few people waiting and I proceeded to inform the hostess, two please. She said, \"Okay maybe 30-40 minutes.\" Where in the hell are all those people waiting then? I didn't really see them or their cars. In actuality, the wait ended up being about 20 minutes. I did tell her we didn't care if it was the bar or a table. Plus, it was only two of us so that probably made things easier. The restaurant itself isn't that big to begin with. Also, the tables are small and in close proximity to one another. I could've practically reached over with my chopsticks to ninja that Cajun albacore sushi off the neighbor's plate if I wanted to. There were some nice flat screens on the walls, just in time for the NBA All-Star events.  I HIGHLY recommend you arriving early. Don't show up during crunch time and expect to be seated immediately. They NO LONGER accept reservations nor do I think they care if you carry a platinum player's card from one of the many prestigious casinos on the strip. You may want to ditch the entire posse because rolling deep here will probably mean a substantial wait time unless you come super early. This restaurant closes at 3AM and opens at 11:45AM so you have plenty of time to figure out when is best to stroll in.  Once seated, you have the option to either do the regular pay for whatever you order or go all out and hit the AYCE: lunch $22, dinner $27. Personally, we were there to make it rain. Here's the thing about AYCE especially when it comes to sushi, you must have a strategy. Now, before you all say that you hide the rice (which they repeatedly discourage it here; signs placed everywhere), that is not the only tactic to rely on. First, let me be clear when I say that they do not try to play you by giving a heap of rice. The rice portion for our sushi & rolls was actually quite minimal and I give them props for it. Most AYCE sushi joints as we know will load up with this lovely carb to get us full faster. If you attack all the crazy rolls they have, you will obviously get full fast. Luckily, for you they offer half orders on 80% of their rolls so you are able to try their many numerous rolls. Our first round, we attacked the sushi off the bat. I could've sworn, we ordered up to 8-10 nigiri sushi. Might as well test the quality of the fish.  The amount of food we ordered was tremendous even though it was just the two of us. Our small table was always cluttered or packed with dishes, either empty or full. Service was quite efficient. They constantly cleared out our plates, refilled our drinks, and the food came out in a timely manner. You have about an hour to do the AYCE I believe. Don't worry, it's plenty of time. Don't feel like you need to order everything in the first blow and gulp everything down. We probably ordered 4 or 5 times total and we still were able to somehow squeeze in desert before the hour ended. Before you kill everything in front of you, bust another order so that they can start making it and it'll be in front of you sooner to save time.  As I said, we ordered way too many different items that I can't even recall much in great details. Don't forget to check their specialty menu because it may change daily. They supposedly serve some soup noodles starting at 11pm. I guess to draw in the drunkies.   Not everything was a thumbs up but I definitely thought that most of what we ordered was pretty good and fresh. If you love pork, get the pork belly appetizer. You will probably order a few. The spider roll was great but uber heavy and if I would've known, I would've avoided it so I can eat more of other things. Plus it's listed under the \"Can't order  1/2 only\" section. Check out the Sexy Girl roll, that was one of the tastier specialty rolls. You will notice that there are many sexual inspired names for these rolls too. The miso soup was a bit bland. You can get the tamago sushi, sweet steamed egg without the rice which was really fresh and baked to perfection. The lychee sorbet and the green tea creme brulee was just alright. I wished I ordered the tempura ice cream or the always classy, green tea ice cream too but I was about to explode at that point. There were a number of other stuff we ordered but I'll leave the whole \"wanting to order everything on their menu\" experience for when you go check them out yourselves.  I would like to add though that their seaweed salad was very refreshing. We ordered it 3x!  I don't think you will be disappointed if you ate here. It was one of the better AYCE sushi joints I've experienced. You can't expect the bomb biggity bay at these type of AYCE sushi places but Sushi House Goyemon does an overall outstanding job in every aspect of the getting the job done.   Remember, I warned you to stay away from this place during peaked.",

    "text": "So annoyed that I waited over two hours to get disappointing sushi. You must go early, probably like when they open, to avoid a rush. I was discouraged to go somewhere else for ayce sushi based on the fantastic reviews. One of the review said they went somewhere else and regretted it so I didn't want to make the same mistake they did. But I guess it was a lose-lose situation. The server we had was great. We put in a massive order once we sat down because we had two hours to study the menu. The sushi itself was disappointing because their nigiri and rolls were small portioned and the fish wasn't fresh. You can find fresher fish at Sakura sushi east of the strip. It is not worth starving yourself to eat mediocre sushi. Don't do it, just say no and go.",

    "text": "Alright alright alright. I mean that in every Matthew McConaughey way possible. This place is solid as a an AYCE sushi place can get.   We were seated in about 40 minutes on a Friday night. The hostess had told us an hour and took our number, I was very pleasantly surprised at the convenience of the online system in which you can see where you are in line. Every restaurant in the world should have this system. We were seventh in line, then fifth, and then a text \"Are you coming? If so press 2\" etc.   The rolls here are sub par. They aren't bad. They aren't good. Nothing I ordered really \"popped\". They were good, but they didn't leave me flabbergasted and fascinated like Yama Sushi's 'No Name' roll or Kaya Sushi's 'Cinderella' or 'XXX3' roll does. While eating a roll all I could think was \"I need to order more nigiri.\" Why? Their Sushi Nigiri is by far the best in town that I have had.   Salmon Belly, Salmon Collar, even plain ole' happy Tuna and Yellowtail were all phenomenal. Melt in your mouth. Oh lord the unagi made me want to order all of it they had in the building. The rice was perfectly made, even a Japanese chef would cry at its delicious chewy and sticky quality I imagine. Their sushi rice is the best I've had in Las Vegas. If you come here, come as a fan of nigir. If you come here as a fan of rolls and rolls only you are going to be disappointed.   My girlfriend is one of those people , she gives this place a strong 2 1/2 stars.   The servers were friendly, we had no issues with service. The 26 bucks a person for dinner was definitely worth it and we'll be back!   TL:DR: Go for Nigiri, not for rolls. Order Salmon Belly and Pork Belly.",

    "text": "This was my second time here. The first time, if I had written a review it would have been a solid 4.5, but something must have changed here!  On a Thursday night, there was an hour wait. We were hungry but we all thought it was a good sign that it was so busy - wrong! After our hour of waiting around, we were seated by a bland hostess who didn't seem to want to be there. Then we waited at our table for someone to take our drink order. Once we finally got our waters in, we ordered some AYCE appetizers and nigiri. I've never waited so long for any nigiri ever!  Basically, the entire meal, the service was terrible. On to the food review:  The rice on the nigiri was very small (YES!), so we thought we could eat more! But. The rice was so hard and chunky that it was barely edible. The fish was good and most of the rolls that we had tried were good. The appetizers were all good. Notice, that nothing was great. Well, just one thing - I have to agree that the pork belly literally saved this trip. It was so tender and delicious. Other than that, I have to go with yelp's two star saying, \"Meh. I've experienced better.\"  Yes, I did come in hungry, and yes, I did leave full. But it just wasn't a great experience for me. With so many fantastic AYCE sushi places in Vegas, businesses really do need to step up their entire game. I think Goyemon maybe have fallen complacent in their ratings.",

I spent $29.50 on this?  *Everything was dry, edamame was that of shoe leather and dry as a bone.  *Rice was super dry. Vegetables in the sushi were clearly previously frozen. *Pot stickers were burned. *I wish I could cuss on Yelp. *bathroom was gross, no TP no soap.  *what happens when a restaurant doesn't have soap in the bathroom?

    "text": "My absolute favorite AYCE sushi in Las Vegas! Good quality fish and very tasty menu items.   I personally go to any AYCE sushi for the nigiri. They give you decent portions of fish on top of a small bed of rice. If you go for dinner, you HAVE to get the salmon belly... It literally melts in your mouth! The salmon, tuna, yellowtail, and the Cajun Albacore are some of my favorite nigiri that are my go to's. My mouth waters just thinking about it!  For appetizers or sides, I always get the miso soup, seaweed salad, and the tuna poke. It makes the AYCE meal complete.   You can order rolls or half rolls too, and there is a large selection you can choose from. They're delicious, but for AYCE sushi I would rather get full off of the nigiri.  Grilled salmon collar, gyoza, shrimp tempura, baked mussels, and teriyaki chicken are a few of the other small dishes for those who might not like raw fish or sushi. Although if you didn't like sushi, I'm not quite sure why you'd be dining at an AYCE sushi restaurant...  A mochi is the best way to end the meal. There's other delectable deserts to choose from as well, ranging from green tea ice cream to lychee sorbet.  The only negative about Goyemon is that the servers can get busy and become inattentive. There's also usually a bit of a wait, but when it's one of the best all you can eat sushi in Las Vegas, a wait is a given, and well worth the wait.",

Comes with sashimi, chicken teriyaki, tempura, salad, seaweed salad, miso soup and rice.   I didn't care for the quality of the food. The sashimi were tiny slivers. Chicken teriyaki hardly grilled (was white). My miso soup tasted like they didn't rinse the dish when they washed it so it tasted soapy and I didn't finish it.   Location: we only came here because it wasn't far from the International Market.    Service: ok.   I don't plan to be back.",

The garlic edamame is amazing and the tuna poke. Not a fan of the calamari just because I'm not use to thick pieces. But hey they have a \"Vegas Knight Roll\" that isn't bad and they are showing support to our boys so hell yeah. We will be back.",

The long waits and new non-enthused servers didn't bother us much but the fact that they charged us an additional sushi roll for not eating ONE PIECE of sushi.  What a joke.  The worse part is that the little Asian server with all the makeup had the nerve to take off the trash that we placed on the one piece of sushi and gave us the Option of paying for a roll or eating the dirty sushi. Other than her horrible service, we usually have a great time here",

    "text": "To Goyemon and who ever eats there: On 2018 Valentine's day, me and my wife had dinner at this restaurant, we have experienced very unpleasant circumstance  which a mid-age american couple sat next to us complained to the team lead manager that we were being rude to them and had disturbed their dinning mood. What happened was we were having great time talking about our day in Chinese, we laughed and told jokes, which we have no conversation with them what so ever. Even though after that instance occurred, which we were having no clue that were being complained. After they left, i ask the team lead what's going on and we got to know that we were complained by the couple sat next to us, we as foreigner from other country felt deeply offend by the racial discrimination. In this Yelp post I'd like to say just you might don't understand another language, doesn't mean that people were talk shit and make fun of you, stop your non sense assumption. Black history month which supposed to reminds people to live free and all human born equal, it is truly shame racism and racist still exists now days!   NO RACIAL DISCRIMINATION!!!",

    "text": "SUPER FRESH ALL-YOU-CAN EAT SUSHI :D  Bite size little balls of deliciousness! The menu is extensive from appetizers, udon, tempura, speciality rolls, sashimi, and dessert! They also have daily specials which they only have a limited amount! When I went they had cooked tuna jaw and salmon belly sashimi. Both were super fresh and tasty. What I really like about this place is that they don't overstuff you with rice like I feel like most places do. I am going to mention what I can remember because I feel like the food just kept coming.   Scallop: You have to try the raw scallop. It was SOO perfect, it just melted in your mouth.   Uni: I tried Uni for the first time here and that was AMAZING! Sadly you are limited to 2 pieces of Uni per person.    Fried spicy tuna: I forgot what this is called, but its spicy tuna on rice fried to perfection. It is one of the appetizers. So tasty! It is fried just slightly to add a little crunch to your bite.   Salmon Belly: This was a special that day which was very yummy! So moist and melted in your mouth!   Tuna Jaw: It was baked I think? It was veryyyyy tasty! This was a special of the day.  Sashimi Salad: yummy!! Nice portion of greens and raw fish on top.  Seaweed salad: can never go wrong with seaweed salad :]  Edamame: There is an option between garlic and regular. I didn't really like the garlic soysauce one. Go for the regular!  Octopus: Not that great, it was chewy, but isn't it always??...  And on to desserts! There were so many choices from green tea ice cream, red bean ice cream, sherbert, green tea creme brule, vanilla ice cream, green tea mochi, tempura ice cream. I think I am missing a few, but there were so many options!!   The green tea ice cream and creme brule were both yummy!! Others said the green tea mochi was good too! The tempura ice cream was just plain vanilla with a thick batter. The batter was too thick and not really tempura fried.. so I wouldn't get that again.   The service was also phenomenal! The food came out quickly each time we ordered and waitress was always very friendly and attentive! This is a gem off the strip of Vegas! $27 such a steal!!",

But take it from a Hawaiian that has eaten fish right out of the sea, that this place is jams! Hamachi kama, salmon belly nigiri, super white, yellow tail, caterpillar roll, red dragon roll, miso soup, and green tea ice cream on lock. This place is like 10 minutes off the strip and open till 3 am. Parking is never a problem and the staff is very friendly and attentive. They're a little slow when they're slammed with customers, but that's completely understandable if there's only a few people on staff at 1am. The only thing I have left to say to the owners of the business is PLEASE OPEN A GOYEMON IN LA OR HI",

Typically wait time is 15 minutes here if not the weekend and 20-30 on a busy day. From a sushi standpoint, their sushi doesn't really stand out; nothing spectacular I can think of even though I order their most expensive rolls. But the appetizers are pretty good. For instance their tuna and tako poke is decent. Their mussels are pretty flavorful. Their tempura is fried correctly. To top it off they do have some seasonal/daily special items like ramen/udon, miso soup with clams and other flavors of ice cream. So food is above average like 3.5 stars. But what makes it 4 stars is the small things: 1. They have a reward program where if you buy 10 meals, you get one free 2. They actually allow their clients to try as many of the desserts as you want (some sushi AYCE restrict you to one) and 3. Their parking is easy (as restaurants expand in Vegas, parking can be an issue whether it be on or off Strip). I would come back.",

We truly appreciate her for being so kind and considerate.  Just as lovely in person and what's inside  shows on the outside. She's a keeper in my book. Don't let her go.  I also would like to say that Sarah is one of the most amazing most prolific intelligent employees that exemplifies noble charisma and her assisting our tables this evening made us feel more than welcome and this beautiful establishment. Thank you so much. Yes I can go on and on about her exquisite deliverance of herself to our table she went up and beyond the Call of Duty your teachings to her exemplified itself in a monumental manner here you thank you so much many places to your establishment and many more employees like miss Sarah God bless",

However, my boyfriend loves it so I have to endure.  Luckily for me, even he now sees the decline in service and quality.   On this particular trip we almost never saw our server and she seemed super bothered to be anywhere near us.  The food also came out so slowly.  We got a spicy tuna roll and it was spoiled.   Like actually disgusting tasting and I got no apology or even any empathy for it.  I actually feel like The server tried to ignore us more after that.   The mussels which are my absolute favorite were sad and watery.   The rest of the items were ok.   Not bad boy outstanding.     I just wish my bf would stop trying to see if it's \"good today...\"",

Until a few months ago one of the server her name was Sarah gave us a very bad attitude and was very rude to us which I am not going to mention about the detail because this is not the main reason I am writing this review today. I haven't been here in a big while afterwards as to how pathetic of what happened. Until today I want to give Goeymon a try again because I love the food here and aside from what happened the service was always good. Timmay always take a very good care of me and my friends whenever I come here too. So I decided to come back and I've got an excellent service from Jamie today. I would have given her 10 stars  if I could. She keeps coming back to the table to check on me if everything was ok. She was very friendly and she works hard to keep the service on point. She even offer a new stamp card too.. I will definitely start coming back because of Jamie and Timmay now.",

The server was friendly however it took about 5 min for them to ask us if we would like something to drink. Once we got our drink and we ordered a couple stuff it was great! The sushi tastes really fresh and I love how have large selection of nigiri! In between once we ordered our food we had to wait about 10 min each time for the sever to come back again to take another order. At the end we ended up leaving without dessert because they took too long to come by that we just asked for the check. I would come back again because the food is really good, hopefully next time is better service.",

The green tea cake is very tasty.    The ambience is more elegant an deep rich dark colors that are very modern an inviting.  Their Sushi bar is smaller but they have a grill/range in view of the dinning room.  I am always a fan of open kitchens, that way I know if my food was handled properly (which it always is).    The sushi is so far superior in quality to most other AYCE locations I have tried.  If you can say it, sit at the bar and order OMAKASE.  The Sushi chefs are really inventive and have ingredients that are not listed on the menu which they prepare for fun.  It is a top notch dining experience.   GO, EAT, BE HAPPY!",

The quality and freshness of the food is excellent.  This place gets very busy, the longest wait I had was one hour, but it was worth it.

    "text": "The beginning of the summer marked a realization of sorts: I am no self-professed sushi connoisseur. Far from it, the best I've ever had was probably made in my school's dining hall - sad, I know. But when my brother and his friend decided to go to Sushi House Goyemon, I had to go.  We all decided to do the the AYCE, and from the taste of the appetizers, I was glad we did. From the Spicy Tuna Rice Cracker (rice deep-fried then topped with spicy tuna and yum yum sauce) to the Seaweed Salad to the orgasmic Pork Belly, I was in love at first course. Then, within 2.5 seconds, Katrina M. and my brother ordered nigiri in endless quantities - some of the standouts were the Garlic Tuna (an absolute favorite), Super White Tuna, Eel, and the Scallop. All of which were incredibly fresh; if it weren't for Vegas being landlocked, I could have sworn the Uni was plucked straight from the sea. As for rolls, we ordered the Lemon Roll, which was perfect in all of its citrusy lightness.  Dessert was not even the end of it! With options of Green Tea Creme Brulee (though I am not as convinced on it as my brother is), Mochi, and Green Tea Cake, my absolute favorites were the Lychee Sorbet and Tofu Cheesecake. The former is light enough that I can justify ordering two bowls. The latter combines my two favorite things in the world into one non-guilt-inducing dessert! With the tartness of the mangoes, I can't help but feel okay eating the Tofu Cheesecake - hey, at least I'm eating some fruit too!  Goyemon is certainly smart - not only is AYCE 27 dollars and worth every penny in quantity and quality, but it doesn't mess around with the nonsense of being open for lunch. Dinner only means by an hour of being open, the place is already packed, and there's a line forming. Thank goodness for such a timely brother, we always manage to arrive right after they open and miss the treachery of waiting for such deliciousness.",

Only got a couple more down. Said he still had to charge us for half a roll (4 pieces) but would be the cheapest roll $6. Thanks bro. Will never, ever go there again. Not consistent.

The pork belly is maybe the best thing ever made.  How good was it?  My wife even loved it and she doesn't generally like pork belly.  We were also big fans of the white tuna, the scallop, and the salmon belly.  My wife loved the pixie roll and the chubby roll.  You can also order a handroll if you don't want the cut roll.  They also have uni, amaebi, and sardines.  They only thing we did not have when we went was the toro.  For all you can eat, they have premium sushi.

Unfortunately the last time I was here the service was just unacceptable.   There is a time limit while dining here. One hour if I remember correctly. I understand the time limit thing but on the night I was there, my friend, her husband, baby and I were having dinner when my friend's brother called. We invited him to join us. He arrived 25 minutes into our meal. We all had ordered ayce and informed the server that he would be too. She told us that he was not allowed to join our table because we only had 35 minutes left. We asked to speak to the manager. The so-called manager came over and told my friend's brother he was not allowed to join us. He was rude and unapologetic.  We tried to explain to him that we had 35 minutes left. I understand if our hour was almost up but it wasn't. We asked if he could sit at another table in the restaurant and our server said yes. We didn't get a chance to ask the \"manager\" because he rudely walked away while we were talking to him. We really didn't understand why he could have sat at another table but was not allowed to join ours. If the \"manager\" had taken 2 minutes to explain it to us rather than just tell us no and walk away we might have felt better about spending our money there.   There are numerous ayce sushi restaurants in Vegas. Spend your money where it's appreciated!",

Too bad the card expired since it had been 1.5yrs since my first visit. One year expiration, oh wells lol. The place is fairly small. I can imagine during the busy times there might be a long wait. A plus is that it's open very late(3am) every day, even Sunday. The wait tonight wasn't too long, 20min. I could have sworn the dining time limit posted was 90min but it's 1hr now. I could be wrong and I'm not sure how strictly they enforce it. All-you-can-eat(AYCE) is always the way to go! $27 for dinner here. I do remember the wonderful crispy rice cracker with spicy tuna on top of it. If the rolls look similar to Sushimon, I believe it's the same owners. I'm told they also own Monta Ramen. I had the seared salmon salad. The dressing was a bit salty. My sister HAD to order the Mahalo Roll, which is basically a spam musubi in roll form. Our hawaii roots hehe. Ordered cajun albacore & seared salmon nigiri. They were pretty small even for nigiri, with paper thin slices of fish. Those actually were pretty salty to taste too. That part disappointed a little since those are two of my favorite things to eat when having sushi. Ordered a few other rolls and appetizers. I also sampled others between the 3 of us. Rest were decent aside from the salty nigiri & salad. Service was very good. When waiting for a table, they will take your number and call you when something is available. Our waitress was very attentive, checking on us often and refilling drinks and taking empty plates away. A decent place to get your sushi fill. I was sitting on 3.5 stars for this place. I couldn't in my right mind round it up though. Since theres other places I would prefer over Goyemon that I gave 4 stars.",

The hostess then said they'd seat us when the 6th person in our party arrived. And so numbers 6, 7, and 8 all arrived at the same time. We asked to be seated and were told it would be another15 min and we were asked to wait outside. I refused to wait outside because that was a ridiculous request, it was cold, and their seating procedures were random and stupid. I then asked for a beer while we waited...over 30 minutes at this point. I thought there was no way I'd be charged for this beer, but I was wrong. All in all, we were sat after about 35 minutes and lots of confusion. No apology for the situation and no gestures to make up for it. The food was good. The service was okay. No one knew what was going on. Our drink orders were taken by one server, then 5 min later a different server asked to take our drink orders again. I'll never go back to this place again. There's better sushi restaurants with better service and employees with common sense all over this city. Who needs this place?",

The restaurant was pretty full. but service wasn't bad. So we all ordered the ayce, but we only got one round, cause it was that bad Lol. All the rolls & nigiri has a lot of rice, it was so hard to finish everything.

Sometimes the waiters/waitresses can move slowly BUT the sushi is delicious and worth the compromise on service speed (their staff is very friendly). They allow you to order half rolls which is something I appreciate because sometimes I don't want an entire 8 piece roll!! Delicious baked green mussels (order those first because they take a little while to come out), shrimp tempura is good.....pretty much everything on the menu is delicious. My favorite roll is the tiger. If you order mochi, know that it will most likely be frozen when it comes to your table so just let it sit for a few minutes. Lol",

They were out of uni which made me really sad. Then they said that they didnt have mochi, or tempura ice cream, so me and the gf got green tea ice cream only to have green tea soup handed to us instead. From there I assumed their freezer wasnt working, but our server still assumed it would be okay to give us an almost completely melted serving of ice cream. But really put the nail in this coffin was that every sushi place lets you eat for your time limit of 60mins.. At our 45 minute mark our server, (I kid you not) hands our check right as we finished giving her our order, idk if thats a goyemon thing, or if they were trying to just kick us out. We should've went to their other sibling sushi-house like we always do. (I should've took pics of everything lol, oh well)   Sushi-Mon over Goyemon anyday.",

Not too long after we started eating, did the wait go from 0 to an hour and a half! Guess we walked in at just the right time.  Food came pretty quickly. My sister even said her \"ecstasy roll\" was the best sushi she's had in a super long time! Sushi was good and fresh, but the salmon collar I ordered was nothing like I've ever tasted. Over cooked and dry, makes for not a happy foodie. Mom and dad both ordered a salmon dinner special, and both their salmon came out the same as the collar. We were a bit disappointed, seeing as this IS a sushi house.    Service was friendly, ambience is nice, and the sushi was good. I'd come back despite the salmon fail, I just wouldn't order it again.",

Apparently, it seems like this place no longer plans on having UNI (They have a sign that read \"NO UNI\", but it's been there since like 3-4 months ago.   The most recent trip, when i entered and saw that same sign still there, i asked them, since we're planning on getting dinner and UNI is a limited order for dinner but you guys don't have it, what do the customer's get instead...front lady said, \"NOTHING.\" We as customer's just pay more for dinner to get cheated on UNI...honestly considering the wait and the quality of the food going down this place, i can't help but give poor ratings to this place.

I must admit this place has LOT more selection then my normal spot 808 sushi. I liked the fact they had chalkboard near the sushi area they write down the special they have each day and most of them is included on the AYCE!! Something make sure take look at when deciding so don't miss anything.   I always start with nigiri. Always been my favorite although I still naturally get my speciality rolls in but am old school fish and rice. I always felt that nigiri one of the best judges of  the quality of the fish. I was impressed for sure the quality of all the fish they have is excellent! The speciality rolls tried the 9-1-1 roll had nice little kick too it and the Ecstasy roll looked good tasted alright but next time try another one. The poki was solid. It usually miss comes too poki at AYCE not all place have them. Still have too give the edge 808 poki style is more local style that I love and use too. The thing that stand out about the poki here is they use some fresh seaweed along with nicely thin shaved white onion, and nice poki sauce. Tried the grilled prok belly with mango salsa. Tasty!! The pork belly perfect hard grill sear on the outside and little of mango salsa top of it. It like pork butter goes down smooth. Majority of it nigiri not go wrong with any one I pounded the hamachi, albacore, and salmon. Loving it!  I sat at the sushi bar. The sushi bar really like the set up! It had lots of room for your sushi. Unlike tradition ones little further back say from the glass and see all the fish there using for the night. You have added shelf on top stack empty plates if pounding away like that extra space (minus is reach further over too get the sushi)! =) They have nice widescreen tv behind the bar. It monday night football so any major sporting event perfect spot for sushi and sports. It not like most place tv far away right in front of you.   The service was awesome. The hostess greeted you and sat you down. The serve keep up with drinks full. The sushi chefs all really friendly, talk stories with them, and lot of fun. You might not want too go early because the place is packed luck out got spot at the bar. The selection is Nuts! Sure I need too go back few more times make sure try everything!!",

I, myself, am more of a purist. I want the best of the best so I wasn't all that impressed. It was like eating at a cut rate sushi place when really you were dreaming of Nobu or Sushi Samba.  But, really, for less than $50 you can get all of the sushi you want, who can complain?   I enjoyed the 911 roll which boasted of habanero sauce but totally failed to deliver (I can take a LOT of heat so take this with a grain of salt).  I actually had to ask for a hotter roll. The chefs tried a roll that was supposedly much hotter, but barely registered on my tasted buds. To be fair I was raised on habaneros my whole life so my perception may have been skewed.   The tempura was delicious as were really all the rolls I ordered. It was fun to look at the vast menu, find something I found interesting, and order it. If you want to explore all aspects of sushi, this is a good place to start.   The service is a step above perfection. You don't have to wait or ask for anything.   This place is definitely a casual go-to spot to hang out, try good sushi and relax. Definitely recommend.",

The interior design mixes the Japanese izakaya style with the contemporary. It is a nice place to look around, and of course eat.  The service is always good. The staff is quick and friendly, although they always make sure I know 1 order means two pieces. This is because I order a ridiculous amount of nigiri, but it's understandable.  The fish almost always looks and tastes fresh (for an AYCE sushi joint), and the rolls I try dance in my mouth with joy. I like how we have an option of ordering half a roll, so that we can try more.  Last time I came here was a Monday or Tuesday night and it was packed. Know that you'll have to wait about 15 minutes to get a table, because this place is pretty popular.  Be sure to get a stamp card, too. Your 11th visit is free AYCE!",

Waited 50 minutes but was quoted 60 so that was great to get in a little bit sooner. We typically come in large groups for celebrations and usually have 2-4 kids under the age of 4. Each parent gets a share plate which is typically $3 as a small child will not eat enough to cover an all you can eat plate. Last night they told us they no longer did share plates unless they were under 3 and we had to pay full price ($26.95) for the children or buy a la carte for them. That was a big disappointment as we've been coming here for over a year without any issues.   Once we figured out what the kids were going to eat, the service was incredibly slow. The baked rolls tasted burnt, half of our things didn't get delivered to our table, we had to ask multiple times for items and drink orders were wrong.   All in all it was a disappointment. This was our favorite sushi spot. We will most likely choose a new place to go to that will accommodate children better. A child is not going to eat $26.95 worth of sushi.",

I'm aware that here, you have a time limit when you eat, but half our rolls took 20 minutes to get to us, and meanwhile our server was nowhere to be found. I'm an avid AYCE sushi eater, so I've been to plenty of other sushi places. And I have never EVER been kicked out because of a time limit. Wanna know why? Because I received my sushi in a timely fashion. Which is not the case here. And I'm not talking about just a few minutes longer than usual, I'm talking about how my friends and I sat idly by watching the tables on either side of us get served and enjoy their food for 20 minutes while we waited for food that would never come, because we had reached our time limit.  One of the first rolls I ordered was a lemon roll and I literally did not receive it until 5 minutes before we were 'kicked out'. Keep in mind their time limit is about an hour and a half. If it weren't for the quality of the food I would never come back here. So I guess I would recommend Goyemon, but beware of the awful service.",

    "text": "We entered hungry as a group of 5 after a long day of exploring around the vast place, which is Las Vegas... We exited as rolly polly balls probably since it felt like we needed someone to roll us out of the joint.    Probably one of the best $30 investments I made for all you can eat sushi. No arguments there.   Wait time can be horrendous and it seems to get packed super fast. Luckily enough for our group of 5, we had no wait!   There seems to be a limit on certain things you can order. The expensive ones like the ebi/shrimp and uni (I believe) all falls under this cap. Ebi was delish, don't forget to try. And to say I'm not usually an ebi getter!  Unagi for days (was a bit boney), but the flavor was there, and the spicy ahi/tuna hand rolls (note, it being spicy, I needed a couple of water refills), and raw fish up the ying yang. We ate anything and everything,  including fried shrimp heads (do not fear the shrimp heads, they're actually not that bad even though you're eating a face).  So though I'm raving why only 4 stars? Because I'm a major dessert fan, the tempura/fried ice cream and green tea ice cream did not do it for me. The ice cream in the tempura batter really didn't taste like vanilla ice cream, it kind of had the consistency of sherbert. Also, the tempura batter was soggy and not crunchy like when you think of typical fried ice cream. The green tea ice cream came to us half melted,  resulting in a puddle of frothy melted ice cream. That made me sad.  Then again, you really don't come to an all you can eat sushi for their desserts. Sushi... Goyemon aced it!",

He totally messed up the uni ( I KNOW RIGHT? how can u mess up on uni?) he basically took out the plate of uni and instead of giving me the whole layer of the UNI piece, he literally kept cutting the uni into pieces and laying it ontop of the rice.. which basically turned the UNI into crumbled broken pieces. ON TOP OF THAT!!  He doesn't even know how to roll out the rice for the nigiri. NEW CHEF PLEASE!!!  not trying to be racial but, THIS IS WHY U DON'T GO TO SUSHI RESTAURANTS WHERE u have MEXICAN sushi chefs. HE SERIOUSLY DIDN'T KNOW WHAT HE WAS DOING...I know it's all u can eat, but damn can u cut the fish any thinner?",

Basically everything on the menu including appetizers, salads, ramen, and even deserts are available for order and the service is especially amazing at the bar.  The sushi chefs and waiters were fun to chat with and were super fast with our orders.  The coolest thing about this joint was that they took half roll orders!  You could try a bunch of different types of special rolls without ordering too much.  This was especially nice when there were only 2 of us sharing a meal.  3.5 stars for the sushi quality (good, but not great. I'm turning into a sushi snob), but giving them 4 stars for the amazing and friendly service.  Go for an early dinner to avoid the rush.  I can't believe that this place is open until 3am!

I was guided here by the folks from Monta noodle House.   First and foremost let me just say this place will now be one of my favorite spots for sushi,  I can say that each piece was pure balance of flavor & taste. All of their varied great dishes and add-ons were prepared with good flavor, even their personal sashimi salad was well made and was a great opening dish.   The extra white tuna was phenomenal, and it melted in my mouth all the rolls we had were well balanced and made with the greatest attention, I complimented all of the dishes with a small tasting of 3 of their best sakes which helped all the flavors unfold in my palette. I recommend eating at the sushi-bar since you get a chance to interact with the sushi chefs and get everything at your will.  Enjoy",

I was really pleased with the salmon belly, yellowtail, big eye tuna, super white tuna, mackeral,sweet shrimp, and much more.  The fish to rice ratio was spot on and it just tasted of a better grade compared to all the other AYCE's.  In addition to the nigiri, we got the grilled pork belly (think we got 6-7 orders total between 3 of us), grilled vegetables, spicy tuna on crips rice, and much more.  Definitely order the specials off the chalk board - some of them have limits of 1 per person.  No toro the day we went.  Also, go after 11pm to get Shoyu Ramen.  It is the same as Monta.    The atmosphere is probably the nicest of any AYCE.  As stated, they are in the Monta Ramen family, so I am hopeful the sushi quality and consistency will remain.    I've tried over a dozen AYCE sushi places in Vegas.  Please - if you know of any better, message me.  Unitl, then I will be coming back here with my stamp card.  9 more till the freebie!",

    "text": "My expectations were through the roof but they barely got off the ground.  I don't know man, it must've been a bad night. IT MUST HAVE! It's hard to imagine why on a Friday night such a highly acclaimed venue would have any bad nights, but I'll give them the benefit of the doubt. I'm down for a second shot at this place, but my first overall experience was very, very mediocre.  The rice to fish ratio was just ugh...bad. No bueno. Yelling mercy. By the fourth sushi, there was nothing I could taste except for rice. The rice itself is so thin, almost like jasmine rice. What is this, Chinese food?? If the rice was at least a bit fuller in texture I wouldn't complain. I can also tell the rice is packed differently. It sits there like a small clump, and its hard to break down when you're chewing it. It's very laborious and completely takes away the experience from the fish. No, I don't hide my rice. I eat them as a whole with the fish. Last night I really wish I didn't. Now that I think about it, I think I did leave a few rice clumps here and there under the dish. Hmm, I never had this problem at Xtreme Sushi...  The service was nothing exceptional. Our waitress barely made any eye contact with our table and was slow to take our orders. It wasn't too bad, but I expected at least to be on par with other venues. I mean, the place was not even full and the waitress was hard to find like a rare pokemon (Pikachu in Viridian Forest, anyone?). I never had this issue at Xtreme Sushi...  The fish is OK. I have to say the yellowtail is my favorite. I'm so glad the yellowtail did not disappoint. The shrimp on the other hand, was not that good. Everything else was mediocre. I decide to give it one last shot and order uni (sea urchin). I really like to gauge the quality of the restaurant by eating sea urchin. Sea urchin spoils quicker than other fish, so it's really easy to spot bad sea urchin by the dull color and the foul smell. Would Goyemon pass the sea urchin fish test? Hmm...The anticipation. Man it's killing me. I wave down a waitress and put in the order...GULP!  Well I wouldn't know until next time because they were out. What?!? Are you kidding me...Although Xtreme Sushi has a limit of 1 order per person, I would rather eat ONE uni than none at all.  So that pretty much sums up my whole night. Will my return at Goyemon be a better experience? Movie sequels are rarely ever better than the first one, unless Goyemon is like the Terminator; mediocre first, EPIC the second. Hmm, we'll see...  *Hint hint, and Xtreme Sushi on Southern Highlands is still the best.* ;)",

I don't understand how a place with this many good reviews could miss the mark so far.   My friend and I sat at the sushi bar. First off the sushi chef was very rude. He had a bad attitude and was not attentive at all. We had to get his attention several times though he was maybe two feet away. The chef snapped at my friend when he mentioned that we ordered amaebi instead of ebi which we were served. The chef kept saying you can't get amaebi with AYCE. We both agreed a few times that its ok we will pay for it on the side for the regular order with our AYCE. It was very annoying and frustrating. It was such an awkward meal. I guess that was it for the chef. From that point on everything we ordered was either incorrect or lacked something. I know sushi pretty well. I have been a fan since I was 9, I worked at a sushi restaurant for a long time and learned a lot about it and my friend with me is Japanese. I will say the big eye tuna is tasty! This place just really disappointed me. Not only the yelp reviews excited me but my friends have told me so many great things about Goyemon. Maybe I will have to give them another try.",

After waiting about a +1 hour for 3 people we were seated at the sushi bar.  From what I read this is the best place to be because the service was fast and efficient.  We were hungry and had plenty of time to look at the menu and read yelp reviews so we knew what we wanted.    After ordering mounds of food I started to get worried about being able to finish it after it started to come.  Luckily I was with 2 men who picked up my slack, I believe this is one of the few times I got my moneys worth from a AYCE!    A lot of what we got was personal preference and following fellow reviewers.  The sushi we received was fresh as far as a AYCE sushi place I was not disappointed we got a few hot items some daily specials and some items that fellow yelpers gave high reviews on.  The price was fair for the food and quality we got, our service was fast and efficient, dessert is included in the price which I never get unless I am at a buffet or AYCE.    All in all a pretty good experience...",

As with all AYCE, not everything will be the best quality, but you get good quality fish for a reasonable price.  Some of our faves of the night were: yellowtail - very fresh & creamy lychee sorbet - THE best sorbet, mmmmm strawberry mochi - I love mochi unagi - good texture, not slimy pork belly - great grill flavor but kinda fatty salmon scallop poke salad cucumber salad gyozas  Some of our not so faves of the night were: uni - not freshest sweet shrimp was ok  tuna - not fresh  The location is nice but pretty far from the strip, about 10 minutes drive.  The ambiance is really cute.  Loved the decor and bar area.  It is smaller than I would have expected, about 15 tables and a bar.  The service is top notch as we were never rushed.  Even when we spent about 2.5 hours, they still made sure we got everything we wanted.  I ordered extra dessert a couple of times (hehe).  Definitely recommended for being piggies in the desert!!  What's Vegas without all the munching!!  Don't forget to get a stampcard, buy 10 get 1 free!",

I usually don't like to do the all you can eat option, I tend to eat a little bit more than I normally would and with the shortage of fish we're facing it feels almost immoral to over eat something that is close to extinction, I rather be part of the solution and not the problem but I'll worry about sustainability some other time, my ancestors never did, I would've loved to try grilled mammoth, ride a unicorn or date a mermaid but they finished them all and now I'll have to settle with what we have left. Having said that, ayce gives you the opportunity to try new things that you wouldn't try if ordering from the menu a la carte, so get the all you can eat once, try it all, the good, the bad, the ugly, pick the winners and next time you go back you'll impress your girlfriend by ordering only the best, and if she's not impressed by your sushi expertise, don't worry you can always get you a new girlfriend......there's plenty of fish in the sea.

    "text": "3.5 stars is a good average rating, but I'll round up to 4 stars. The reason for the 3-4 stars is due to consistency. If you come at a bad time/day then it's a 3 star, but if you come on a good day its more like 4-5 star. But True to Vegas, it's a gamble... you never know what you're going to get. But to increase your odds of getting a better experience, coming at dinner during a busier day (Friday-Sunday) actually gets a better experience because you'll get better food even though you'll have to wait longer.  The food here is great if you come on a good day but if it's not, then it's just ok. The just ok is still on par with other AYCE sushi places, but the great days are above and beyond better. The must orders with AYCE are an order of amaebi and uni (only one order per person) and the pork belly. The amaebi is good but nothing special (but you HAVE to order it since you're limited to one anyways) and the uni is actually pretty good for an all AYCE sushi place. The pork belly is AMAZING though on those great days- it's just melt in your mouth delicious. I would do the AYCE sushi just to eat all the pork belly if it wasn't going to kill me!!! LOL  We don't order rolls with AYCE anymore, meaning we only get the nigeri for the sushi portion and some side dishes. I think the nigeri is a good size with the proper amount of rice. We usually order some salmon, super white tuna, albacore, yellowtail, and fresh scallop. Of those, I think the super white tuna and fresh scallop are consistently good, the others are sometimes good and at other times a little fishy (no pun intended). If you're lucky and you come on one of those great days, they'll have Toro on the specials board and OMG the toro is SOOOO good and worth it. You HAVE to order the toro if it's available! As for the side dishes, we usually just order the tempura shrimp and miso soups along with a bunch of orders of the pork belly.  Lastly, the great thing about Goyemon is that it comes with dessert! I really enjoy the Yuzu or ginger ice cream, or the creme brulee if they have it available on their specials. Otherwise the mochi ice cream is good too. If you're in the mood to go to an AYCE sushi place, I would recommend coming to Goyemon- particularly on those busier days if you don't mind the wait!",

This place was decent but I would not return unless I had to.   Rice to fish ratio: I would say the sushi chefs here use too much rice to fish. This was extremely evident in the rolls. I felt like I was eating a roll of rice garnished with a little tiny bit of fish. It's safe to say they are trying to fill you up with rice.   Fish quality: the quality of the fish was decent but not great. I'm a huge nigiri fan because It really enabled you to taste the quality of the fish. Not impressed.   A good indicator of a decent sushi place is the salmon nigiri. It's such a simple piece but contains such a beautiful intricate balance. From my first bite, I knew I would rate this place no better than 3 stars.   There was a few bright spots however. The super white tuna was excellent. They offered half rolls which enabled me to sample a bit. The sexy girl is a solid choice and the red dragon was good.",

    "text": "I'm rating Goyemon as an ayce sushi restaurant, not as a stand alone sushi restaurant. As for an all you can eat sushi restaurant, it's definitely 5 star.  Price is cheap compared to what I'm used to in my hometown, and quality is surprisingly greater than just about any ayce sushi places I've been to, which I can't comprehend because Vegas is surrounded by a desert, whereas I live next door to the ocean. I've been coming here or Sushi Mon at least once every visit I've had to Vegas since December of 2015. I pretty much always stick to the nigiri and eat at the counter in front of the sushi chef. They usually have a limit of 1 order of amaebi, uni, and toro during dinner per person. There is a time limit but either they don't strictly enforce it, or I just eat really quick. Have not been too disappointed with most of the nigiri. Portions of sushi rice is pretty small, so that's a plus. Just keep ordering more! Servers check up on you pretty frequently, and you can order appetizers with them.  I normally get the takoyaki, tempura and steamed shumai. Nothing special about them, but it's something I like to snack on while I'm there. The Hamachi kama isn't bad either. Yes, I'm Japanese, and it passed my taste palate test.",

The service is good and the servers will check up on you frequently, it's pretty easy to wave down a server to order something. The only problem I have would be that they are always packed and they don't take reservations. However, they do have a texting system set up for when your table is ready and they are really strict on the time limit for all you can eat.",

My friend and I got there at about 6:40pm.. it took about 10 minutes for them to come and take our initial order... once placed... We had to continuously ask for refills on our drinks... The shu mai that we ordered was cold... There was no clear indication as to who our server was or if we had to just flag someone down to place another order.. The sesame chicken was fatty and disgusting... after having waited for so long for our orders to get delivered... We questioned ourselves as to whether we should continue to order or wait until we get the food... we waited for a good 20 minutes for our last order to be delivered to the table... When they finally did deliver it it was wrong... We sent it back... Shortly there after while still waiting for the order to be remade... The hostess Nicole rudely handed us our check to which we told her we weren't finished and had not yet ordered dessert... She proceeded to tell us that we were 30 minutes over our time with an attitude in a condescending way... We then told her that we still had orders coming... She then huffingly Took the check back to talk to the servers... we then had to get another server to re-order said items... Because there was no communication between the one we had sent it back with and the one who had delivered it or taken the order... all the while... There was a large table seated next to us who had arrived at about the same time that we had... Who was not offered the check... I can't help but feel as though they were trying to hurry us along faster since we are a bit on the larger side... as we got the check from Nicole again... We gave her a punchcard that we had for frequent Dining... She took it and came back and asked if we wanted to use the free meal that had been accumulated... To which we advised no... The checks were brought back to us but there was no additional punchcard given... We went up to The hostess stand where Nicole was... We informed her that we needed a new punchcard to which she once again was argumentative and stated that we were wrong... only after some persuasion and explaining to her why we needed a new punchcard did she then begrudgingly give it... I can confidently say I will never return",

The place is not big and they close the party room sometimes so wont use the tables in there making you wait longer than you have to =/  What I love about Goyemon is that their fish is usually always fresh. Salmon belly, ikura, and uni are my favorite. Udon is yummy and included in their AYCE menu as well. One of my favorites! Not many AYCE sushi places include udon with their menu so this is a plus for me. For dessert Green Tea Creme Brulee and chocolate moose is yummy!! Also included in their ayce but not listed on the menu so just order it haha  Their price of $27 a person for AYCE is pretty average here in Vegas. What is pretty ridiculous tho is that it's the same price for kids. Would be nice if they had a half off price for children or something bc I'm pretty sure my 4 year old did not eat $27 worth of food. Then they charged my 6 month old baby $3 to share with me ..I guess smh haha",

I continued placing orders,he was talking back, like I needed to stop it I was ordering too much, and he was giving me hard time.  I got up and complaint to the manager. We were having all you can eat! So I felt, we could order. The manager immediately gave us another chef. He apologized for the other chef's behavior and was very professional",

The last time I came here (few months ago) was the straw that broke the camels back.  We sat at the sushi bar and asked for all you can eat. We ordered one order of each nigiri we wanted to try and was immediately asked by the young sushi chef if we wanted two orders each. They have the policy of no leftovers or we be charged so we politely said no one order only. He said ok. After we got the orders, half of the nigiris were drenched in sauce and falling apart, one of the fish on the nigiri was also dried on the ends?? We picked 2 of the sushi we were ok with and reordered. The sushi chef checked the order and scoffed \"I already made this before\"... seriously ?? I didn't even know what to say.  Needless to say we won't ever be back.",

The flavors of each sushi platter was so complex and delicious. To top it off he gave us some freshly made wasibi, which by the way is tantalizing.  With this being a sushi place, the quality of the fish is very important. The king mackerel we ate was flown in from Japan the night before. The fish is never frozen.   This is hands down the best sushi I've ever eaten. Better than Nobu!!!",

Aside from sushi, there is also soup, appetizers, and even dessert included in the AYCE price. So I can eat as many pieces of mochi ice cream as I want?!   The fish is relatively fresh and the best part is that they don't give a huge portion of rice, that way you can enjoy the good stuff. They offer uni and amaebi as well, but unfortunately those are limited to one order per person (2 pieces), which is understandable.   Highlight of the night was the 911 roll. It's essentially a roll with a crazy spicy sauce. The spice was good but it killed any taste of the fish. Spicy rice is what it was. Don't try it, I warned you.  Service was great. We were checked up on often and tea was refilled. Worth the one hour wait? I'm still deciding, but waiting that long definitely worked up my appetite.",

    "text": "Not really a huge fan of AYCE sushi.  Seen this in California since the early 90's.  It seems to be part of the Las Vegas landscape.  I guess it is buffet mentality, most bang for the buck.  You would not think eating sushi in NY, LA or Tokyo would be a world of difference but it is.    I would say that in my opinion of all the AYCE sushi Vegas, Goyemon is the best I've seen.  I was more impressed when they first opened.  They have since increased their hours and business ten fold.  Quality is hit or miss.  Probably would not recommend Sundays, that's when anything raw becomes questionable.  One of the key differences is the variety of product and the fact that they do use fresh tuna.  Everyone else is still stuck on frozen blocks.  Which btw is pretty disgusting.  I think I mentioned this before, but anything bright unnaturally pink or red is frozen.  Maybe you don't care what you eat.  A friend of mine recently said \"you paid $70 for sushi?  You got ripped off,  I usually only pay $25 for AYCE\".  Patted her on the head smiled and said yes you get what you pay for.    Imagine this, of all the fresh tuna sold on the world markets, some doesn't get sold.  Just like the last bunch of produce sitting there in the grocery store.  Some of this tuna can become 3 weeks old.  It is poorly handled then poorly stored.  After this some company in Vietnam or Korea buys 10,000 pounds of this old tuna that nobody else wants for a rock bottom deal.  This tuna is already starting to rot and turn grayish brown on the outside.   But thanks to modern technology, these overseas companies invest in machine and equipment that will treat the fish with coloring and preservative.  All of a sudden it's red again, not really natural red, but good enough.  Then it is frozen, packed and shipped to the US.  Funny enough, these countries ban the sale and use at home, but the North American client is big business.  That is the tuna you eat in most AYCE sushi bars.  Enjoy!  Back to Goyemon who also owns Sushi Mon.  But for some reason the quality is different.   Don't order ala carte, they don't want that either, that's why the same shit is still served.  Technique on sushi pretty good.    Tuna  - usually really good.  last time they were using a cut of the tuna that most people would scrape or discard.  could tell by the weird taste and texture.  1 star.    Hamachi - always decent, but all hamachi unless wild comes the same farm raised fresh, frozen, treated with preservatives or all natural  Salmon - decent as well, though not a big fan of Atlantic salmon.  the only really healthy salmon is possibly Scottish or wild.  Seared salmon is good and gives a nice textural contrast.  <a href=\"/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.albany.edu%2Fihe%2Fsalmonstudy%2Fpressrelease.html&s=6696c9efad440ea4089bd475ef4e6fb758d2025df907dd8267ce4c730026c94b\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">albany.edu/ihe/salmonstu...</a>  Hirame - always good  Pork Belly App - nice to see something different, tasty but the mango salsa needs some work  Katsuo - decent, but they use frozen  Amaebi - actually not bad; only one per person  Uni - only one order per person.  seemed like a lower grade or frozen?  never had this before, taste is ok, but there is a weird uniform color and texture  Unagi - same always good  Sushi rice - usually good, though the last time was kinda dry and seemed old like it was sitting around all day  Tempura - yuck don't get this, might be better in a roll or something  Tamago -  good, thanks for making it and not buying frozen  Super White Toro - bleah  Red Snapper - actually frozen tilapia  Gyoza - same pre-packaged frozen crap  Green Mussels - yes frozen NZ Green Lip Mussels, super cheap and baked with eel sauce and mayonnaise  Rolls - all good, lots of rice, you will be full after about 4 of these then so much for AYCE  Service - Good and attentive  All in all worth making a trip every few months to get your sushi fix.  Not the greatest in the world, but one of the better ones here in the desert.",

I suggest asking your server what fish is fresh that day and making that your main order throughout. The quality is pretty good here considering its an AYCE for under $30. You get stuffed quick because theres a good amount of rice thats put into the sushi/rolls (so watch your rice intake). The tuna was phenomenal that night and I had 4 orders of it alone. Grilled pork belly is popular here but personally wasn't a big fan (mega fatty). Loved the yuzu sherbet! So refreshing & light. Service can be .... Non-existent at times.",

    "text": "Never in my dreams I would even give an all you can eat sushi another try. The last place I had an all AYCE experience was over 4 years ago. So fast forward to Sushi House Goyemon. I just had to trust Yelpers on this one and gave it a try. I surveyed the menu. Made to order sushi that include nigiris? Check. Grilled items? Check. Specials like unlimited aji, salmon belly, & negitoro? Check. Unlimited desserts? Check. Apparently I've been missing out on the Las Vegas AYCE sushi scene.   So I moved here in late August and I've been back for 4 times. Once I waited for 20 minutes. All the other times we've been seated right away at the sushi bar. For $26 per person (dinner), I'm getting WAY more than my money's worth. In fact, I tend to average around $80 every time I eat here, just on nigiris, grilled items, sides, & desserts.   Four stars for VALUE. I knocked off one star just because the cuts of fish tend to be inconsistent and service can be spotty at times, but nothing that would deter me from coming back. - I was always satisfied with the quality of fish they serve (for an AYCE) Sadly, their uni is just so-so, so don't expect high quality stuff. And please bring back the green tea cake on the menu! Overall, this one AYCE I would not hesitate to recommend, but I am still on the lookout for an AYCE joint that serves the freshest uni!",

We asked if we could sit there, the hostess asked the sushi chefs and came back saying that we needed to wait because the main dining room had 2 large parties. More people left the sushi bar, and there were many seats available, so we asked again after 15 minutes, and we were seated. This is the first sushi bar I've been to where the sushi chefs did not greet you when you sat down. With the AYCE option, we were told we could order sushi directly to the sushi chefs. They didn't even make eye contact with us, it seemed awkward to flag them down and make an order. It was also oddly warm for a sushi bar, they had fans blowing in that area. Didn't think the sushi bar was very welcoming.",

The orders come out a little slow and there is a lot of rice so they can stuff you with less sashimi. They have lots of sushi roll choices and it is so worth it for the dinner price compared to the buffets on the strip.  The pork belly is a must-try. I am a big dessert fanatic and had 4-5 lychee sorbets by myself and 2 green tea creme brulees. I have never been to an all-you-can-eat sushi place where they let you have all-you-can-eat dessert too, so this is place is a gem! :D my sugar tooth was high as a kite on lychee sorbet and green tea creme brulee! Great to change things up and eat at this ayce sushi restaurant when you get sick the hotel buffets.",

    "text": "One of the better AYCE sushi places in Las Vegas. There is definitely a large selection of sushi that you can order and other food items that you can order.  I would suggest trying to come a little bit earlier since it can get very crowded and the wait tends to be fairly long. You can put your name down and come back (or they will call you when your next on the list). They do have a time limit on the AYCE (one hour) to limit the time that you sit and increase the turnover of patrons.  Some of the better sushi pieces - yellowtail, salmon, super white tuna, albacore, and halibut. You can also get uni and sweet shrimp in the AYCE but it is also limited to one order (two pieces) per person.   I'm also a fan of some of their appetizers - poke, seaweed salad, pork belly, and baked green mussels.   Overall, we have started to come here for AYCE more often as long as we don't have to wait more than 30 minutes (which on occasion does occur). It is a place to come when you have a big appetite and want to eat and eat and eat. And don't forget the AYCE dessert - green tea and red bean ice cream are definitely something to get too.",

What brought me to actually spend time and write this review for them is because the woman manager's customer service quality is excellent! I can't say the same about the employees. My server was Sarah, she was good but could be much better by improving her attentiveness, there were a few times where we had to get other employees attention just to get Sarah to take our orders. But ultimately, this review is for how this manager made my parents' first experience amazing with a bad start. While we were waiting for our food, a Busser girl was going around collecting plates off of peoples tables, she wasn't paying attention and knocked the plates onto my mother's arm and shirt. The first rule of apologizing to someone, is to say you are sorry. This girl said \"it's ok!\" As her first response to my mother. Ultimately, we know it was an accident, but it was the employee's way of handling the situation, was bad customer service. She should have apologized as soon as it happened. The manager came over and she made the rest of our experience, back to enjoyable and amazing. She was very understanding and calm.  I have been coming to Goyemon for many years and let my parents know that this is the only ayce sushi place I would go for casual dining. This day that they tried, it might have gone off to a bad start, but it was the manager that made my parents happy again and satisfied with food and service. Quick service recovery! Love it!",

Here in Washington, there is definitely an array of options of AYCE that range from slightly better than Safeway to some pretty decent stuff in the Emerald City.  Whenever my partner and I are in Vegas visiting family or the odd wedding, we definitely beeline to this place at least once.  I am a fan of nigiri, so the quality of the fish is up to par.  Girlfriend loves rolls, so I guess she likes it.  This is one of the places to offer half rolls--so you get the opportunity to try a roll and not have to fill up.  This generates the opportunity for your palate to try the many other options available.",

At other places like Yama and sakana, the Uni is extremely bitter, and tastes like the ocean.  It's gross. But here, the Uni is slightly sweet, creamy and so so good. I ordered mine with a quail egg to add to the flavor. It's only one order per dinner though. Unlike other places, they don't do sashimi here. Just nigiri rolls appetizers and dessert. But the nigiri is so fresh and this place by far gives you the least amount of rice. The ratio is very balanced so you don't feel like you're just stuffing your face with rice.   Their rolls are less saucy here because I think the quality is much better. If you're s a small party, order half rolls so you can try multiple and don't get sick of one. Sometimes there's a wait but it's worth it. Staff is friendly tend to your needs. The high notes for me were the salmon, Uni, and white tuna!",

    "text": "This is my first time ever eating in an AYCE sushi restaurant. I have seen a lot of my friends posting on social media about this place and wanted to see what all the hype was.   The restaurant was not so busy when we got there. We had a wait time of 15 mins. We had a party of 8 people. My friends and I loved uni that we wanted to eat during dinner time because that was the only tine they served uni. Dinnertime starts at 4p.   We didnt have our own waitress. All the waitresses walked around to each table to help serve the customers. The staff was helpful in letting us know how the ayce works. The restaurant was also clean.  The price for dinner is I believe $26.95 per person. The food wasn't at all as I expected. The sushi and other food came in small portion. The nigiris was very small, unlike the ones back at home in Hawaii. But the food was delicious, especially the uni. I wished we could order more uni but we was told the customers could only order one order of uni per visit. I think its because uni is an expensive delicatessin. I also liked the maguro nigiri.  I really recommend this place and would definitely return when I visit Las Vegas again.",

    "text": "Came with some other residents from other specialties during orientation for dinner. We had a large group and were told it would be an hour wait (we entered around 5:30PM but were not seated until 6:30PM). The restaurant is not that big so I can understand having to wait but we ended up being seated in a side room, so I'm not sure why they didn't just open up the side room earlier.  The restaurant is clean and has dark walls/tables. Service is okay, but it can be hard to flag down a server later so definitely place large initial orders/ask for what you want early on. There is a one-hour time limit I believe, but don't know how strictly it is enforced.  We had a large group and some of our food orders got confused; either things didn't come or came really late/in different waves. Not a huge issue, but just something to be aware of if you have a large group too.  The AYCE dinner price is $26.95 per person, so not totally sure it is worth it. Sure, there are a bunch of rolls, but not as many appetizer/side/dessert items as another AYCE sushi place I've been to in Vegas. Quality is not bad though, and you can order half-orders of rolls too.  Solid place for AYCE sushi, plus it's only five minutes from my house.  P.S. Open until 3AM!",

    "text": "I used to go here all the time and the stamp card was a bonus! But lately the quality has just gone ridiculously down.  Some of the sush already fell apart before I even got it. The rice isn't packed enough, so that when you try and pick up nigiri, it just disassembles.    The meat is no longer fresh, and uni (one of my favorite orders) tastes bitter.   The service is less attentive as well, it was so hard to get someones attention to order. Also a lot of my orders were missing, I usually have to reorder 2-3 things a visit now.   Over a year ago I would've given them a 5 star. However they just seem to no longer care about quality. I'm shocked about what they think is presentable food. I'm sad, but I will no longer go here.",

The eel melts in your mouth.   3. Unlimited dessert orders.   4. Ayce is $26.95 per person.   Worth every penny! I never want to eat super white anywhere else but here!

It is a little pricey for two people at dinner for AYCE you will pay around 62 dollars but if you are anything like me you will eat A LOT lol. I think the lunch price is 21 something. but it is worth it! Gyozas, dessert, soups and a few other items are all included. They have a bevy if options. Red snapper, yellow tail, tuna, salmon, and albacore are just a few of the different fish they have.  They also have a daily special items like Cajun salmon or grilled pork belly etc. The restaurant itself is really small though so if you have a party of more than 5 it'll be a little cramped but intimate at the same time I recommend the Salmon belly and Cajun albacore!  ***CERTAIN ITEMS ARE ONLY AVAILABLE  FOR DINNER*** I understand that to there are different tiers to sushi and some places may be considered more high quality but I have venture around Las Vegas and tried different AYCE places and none of them have been as good as Goyemon. I know there are different palettes as well that people have. If you are looking for a place that you can go and get some good sushi and kick back with some friends or family I'd recommend highly. Me and my girlfriend go biweekly because we love it so much!",

Now, I've been to a few different all you can eat sushi restaurants in my days and so though I was excited, I really wasn't expecting all that much from the meal except to be really full. Thankfully on a Thursday night at 6pm my wife and I were able to be seated quickly without a wait!   The price for the AYCE sushi menu is $26 per person(a great price!) honestly, I was incredibly surprised by how amazing the meal was! Every piece of sushi was delicious and not packed full of rice like many other AYCE places are(there is a rule that you have to eat all of the rice. If you don't you're charged extra, but this wasn't a problem at all for us, again due to the small amount of right included with every piece of sushi).   I especially loved the scallops and yellow tail sushi, and the pork belly was to die for! This is the best AYCE sushi restaurant I've ever been too, even better than many other non-AYCE sushi restaurants I know of. Check this place out, you won't be disappointed!!!",

How can you tell customer what to do? If you think we are wasting food, just charge us on the bill. But you effect other people's eating mood.

The wait here can get ridiculous at times that I don't even want to bother. The place is rather small so it can get packed super fast. Call first before going there so you have an idea what you are up again.   I think this place is great for their lunch specials and the AYCE lunch and dinners. In terms of quality, I do think this place needs a bit of quality control. When it's good, it's amazing good and when it's not good, it's puke worthy bad. Talk about BIPOLAR SUSHI! Overall, it is good for the most part. Their lunch specials are great too- good amount of food at a decent price. I usually get their seafood bowl or deluxe combo for lunch when I'm not looking to stuff my face with AYCE.   The sushi chefs here are quite friendly but everyone else tends to look pissed off. I don't know if this place is too busy and they are too tired or someone just needs a hug, but generally, not very welcoming or friendly. Occasionally, I'd encounter a friendly one and that's always a pleasant surprise.",

When doing AYCE the rice can be a pain. Fish is good quality and very tasty. Favorites include eel, super white, and cajun albacore.  Rolls - they have a way with sauces! They do a good job of mixing flavors and textures.  Great selection and good variety. Favorites include lasagna, lisa lisa, and pastel.  Apps - good selection of apps and they all are on AYCE menu.   Dessert - nice selection of mochi and other special deserts. I cant get enough of their strawberry mochi and green tea ice cream. Also, as a bonus, dessert is all you can eat too!  Service can be hit or miss, they have a tendency to bring out nothing or everything all at once which can be hard to handle. They usually have a wait but its worth it.

Godddddd.) - All of their Nigiri is to die for, especially albacore, tuna, and salmon - Green Tea Ice Cream - GREAT Hot, Freshly Brewed Tea - You pretty much can't go wrong with about anything on the menu     (sorry I know that does not help)   These guys have everything down to a science. They server you fast and a lot! Trust me you'll be excited to dive on in, but a little tip, brace yourself and drink plenty of tea to help you eat as much as possible ;-)   If you are worried about the freshness of an all you can eat sushi bar- just to put your mind at ease, these guys get anywhere from 1-2 shipments of fresh fish DAILY. Flown in. Yeah.   I'm from California, and, no joke, we make sure to rent a car when we fly into Vegas just because we want to drive out to this place during our stay so often that it is cheaper than getting a cab. Yeahhhh, it's that good. Haha!!   I could go into a long spiel about how unbelievable this place is, and how wonderful and accommodating the entire staff is, but when it gets down to it, this place offers you amazing, fresh food at an insanely reasonable price. That's all you need to know really. I come here every, single trip to Vegas, and is often the reason we even plan trips to Vegas.

I remember going to this 5 star restaurant in the heart of LA, where each nigiri order cost $11-$20+.  The quality here is a VERY close second to that.  All you can eat for $22 for this quality is unheard of.  Service is usually pretty good and quality is consistent every time.  They let you order half orders of the rolls so you can have room in your stomach to try more things as the rolls are always more filling.  The amount of rice in the nigiri is just right (some AYCE sushi restaurants put a ton of rice to fill you up faster for cost efficiency).  The side orders are also very well done.  Even for people who don't like sushi, the side orders are more that worth it.  The best thing about this place is food quality.  I have never been to an all you can eat sushi restaurant that is of higher quality than this place.",

They do take your number and text you when your table is ready. The food- phenomenal! You have to do all you can eat. Very reasonably priced $26.95 for dinner and you can get appetizers to dessert and everything in the middle. I love the fried shumai ! Service is quick once you are seated!",

They said that they don't make reservations and that we should arrive at 5:30 PM and just wait till 7:30 PM to be seated. Or if the table is available earlier, I suppose I would have to take the table and just wait till everybody else arrives at 7:30 PM. I understand not taking reservations for small tables 2-4 people. But seriously, who doesn't take reservations for a table of 13.  They are obviously money hungry and very careless. I don't feel that my request was unacceptable.   I ended up reserving at another sushi all-you-can-eat place. No problems",

I like the fact that they have daily specials and Japanese draft beer. Most of the sushi is not over-seasoned which is great because you can taste the fish not just the sauce. Been going there since they opened and I'll continue going there. Friendly service and great sushi!!!",

Of all the AYCE sushi houses across town, this is the one I continue to come back to, time and time again, and my sushi cravings are never left in naught after a visit. The staff is friendly and efficient, the service is quick, and the bar/tables never seem to be fighting for the sushi chefs' attention in getting their fish onto the table. They don't toot their horn about being one of the more popular AYCE sushi restaurants but they do have an organized system once they start to run a wait, and will even take down your cell phone number to call you if it gets so long you decide not to wait in the restaurant itself.   I usually try to venture out and try at least one different item I'm there, either on their placemat, printed, or chalkboard menus, but usually the process goes like this because in the end, I'm more than pretty dependable:   1. Appetizer. 2. Nigiri sushi. 3. Some type of 1/2 roll.  4. Uni (sea urchin). 5. Ama-ebi (sweet shrimp)  6. Repeat 2 as many times as necessary before 10. 7. Dessert.  8. Happy happy, joy joy.",

It wasn't great as the night we went they ran out of uni but nothing was memorable except for the jellyfish nigiri special which I really enjoyed. It's the only thing that actually made me want to return again.  So tonight I called in to see if they had the jellyfish nigiri special and they said they did. The price for dinner is $27 for the ayce which I consider pretty steep but I figured I'm only in Vegas twice a year so to have the jellyfish nigiri again I would splurge a little. Drove 20 min. to get there and luckily we got seated right away. To my disappointment I didn't see the special and asked the waitress where it was but they said didn't have it and it was probably a mistake. I can understand that since people make mistakes. Already hungry I figured since we were already there maybe we would just stay anyway. I asked the waitress if she could give us 1 more serving of the uni or amoebi to make it up to us which I think is a really small act but they couldn't even do that. I think 99% of restaurants wouldn't mind making it up to a customer. I don't think I shall ever return due to their customer service.",

    "text": "This is one of my go-to AYCE sushi joints because of its selection, quality, and proximity to my house. I haven't had anything I disliked and I really like the fact that you can order \"half rolls\" from their specialty rolls menu!! That's amazing because I love trying as many items as possible and this way, I don't have to eat too much. Their stamp card is also a neat incentive. It does expire though, so it certainly awards frequency in visits or large parties. They do not combine stamp cards, so remember to bring it!  I usually order Tuna, Yellowtail, and Salmon nigiri and hand rolls. Fortunately, they're very good here and one sushi chef in particular handles the fish very well. I like the specialty rolls like the Hurricane, Red Dragon, and Mahalo (which is just a Spam Musubi in roll form, but still so great). I usually go for ones with different fishes and possibly shrimp tempura, but no cream cheese (or I just ask for it to be omitted).  Additionally, service is good and the location is easily accessible. It can get pretty busy, but my fiance, siblings, and I typically go at times to avoid the crowd. That works out well and we haven't had to wait long for a table!  AYCE Lunch is $21.95 and Dinner is $26.95 (as of 09/26/2013).",

The restaurant is located in a simple strip mall next to a Pizza Hut and a couple of foot massage spas (Las Vegas maybe the unofficial foot spa capital in the world) but the ambiance once inside is quite surprising.  Taste is excellent, Price is reasonable and Staff were pretty much on it with orders.  They have a wide array of choices including dessert (mochi & tempura ice cream). The Sea Urchin, Sweet Shrimp Nigiri (limited to two per customer) and unlimited Shrimp Tempura were a pleasant surprise for AYCEs of this price range.   The locals who were with us however said that you have to be here early on order to avoid long lines.  Definitely coming back when returning to the Sin City",

    "text": "I've been to three different AYCE sushi restaurants in Vegas now and I'm torn between all of them. Each has its strengths and weakness and Goyemon is no different. The wait time on a busy night (usually every night) can be up to 45 minutes, but we got lucky and got seated right away on a Sunday evening. They state there's an hour limit (which seems ridiculous) for the AYCE portion of the menu, but I'm not sure how strictly that is enforced.   Starting off with the nigiri, there's only two items that you are limited in ordering: the uni and the sweet shrimp. The uni was fresh and some of the best I've had in Vegas. My other favorites were the halibut (but variable, our second order was mediocre), fresh scallops, and salmon belly. You may also order the shrimp heads (deep fried) by request. This portion of the menu was definitely the best.   Moving on, everything else was mediocre or subpar. The octopus and tuna poke was terrible. There was way too much seaweed and not enough flavor. The pork belly was actually decent and flavorful. The rolls were not very memorable, but they weren't bad either. The dessert was by far the most disappointing. The tempura ice cream was frozen solid and caked in soggy tempura batter. The red bean ice cream my friend ordered was completely melted, more soupy than an actual ice cream. However, I did enjoy the lychee sherbert and the black sesame mochi.   Call ahead for estimated wait times and be sure to grab a stamp card for your 11th meal on the house!",

    "text": "One of the best sushi spots in town. The AYCE pricing is that of an average sushi restaurant ($21.95 Lunch; 26.85 Dinner) if you're into nigiri this is the spot for you. The freshness of the fish served here is much better than other sushi places here in Vegas.  I also like that most of the special rolls on the AYCE menu can be made in half orders, that way you can try out different rolls without filling your stomach.   One con would be the wait times. Expect to wait more than 30-45 minutes if you have a group of 3 or more and don't want to sit at the bar. Busy dinner times and the wait time could go up to an hour or 2. Luckily they can take your phone number down and you can get a text when your table is ready. One thing I wish they could do is take phone reservations because not many people would like to go there just to put in a reservation and have to wait a long time. But then again this place is very popular and has good sushi so it's worth the wait.  I was hoping they'd take a 12 person reservation ahead of time for my birthday because I really wanted to enjoy some tasty sushi with friends. That didn't happen because we tried to call in and since they don't take any reservations through the phone there were no exceptions. Many times we had to go to another spot because we didn't want to wait an hour and a half and my group and I would leave disappointed.   So just be prepared when going here. If you're looking to have a quick meal with a group of people, plan ahead and maybe have someone put a name down that way your whole party doesn't have to wait.  Other than that I still love to eat here and try it out !",

In a city where ayce sushi is as common as a Starbucks, you would think you would have something quite unique or special to have this high of a rating on yelp. With this in mind I bookmarked it, ready for my next dead fish outing to be here. I ordered a wide variety of mostly nigiri with a few rolls. The rice to fish ratio is definitely a little more rice heavy than most places, and very much obvious on the rolls. There were no \"no rice\" roll options on the menu either which is what i usually lean toward. Id say on a positive note the fish seemed of decent quality, thankfully. But there was nothing to require my return to this spot. You let me down on this one Yelpers.",

    "text": "Go into Yelp talk on any given day, and you will always find a \"Where's the best Sushi\" thread. You'll also find a million recommendations for Sushi House Goyemon.   This restaurant is right around the corner from my house, so given the fact that it is always so highly recommended, I don't really know why it has taken me so long to come out.    We arrived around 5 on Friday night and were seated right away.   We don't ever really do specialty rolls, preferring to stick with the nigiri options.    This trip, we kept things pretty simple, and ordered the following: Super White Ebi (cooked shrimp) Amaebi (sweet shrimp/raw, with deep fried heads) Garlic Tuna Cajun Albacore Fresh Scallop Unagi, well done Tako Shrimp Roll (not tempura) Mentaiko Wasabi Crawfish gyoza (fried and steamed) Garlic edemame seaweed salad Cucumber salad  Dessert: Black sesame mochi Green tea creme brulee Tempura ice cream Yuzu sherbet.  In a word:  WOW. Really excellent quality fish.  The super white and scallop just MELTED in your mouth!  The wasabi crawfish was nice, with a great punch to the sinuses.  The Mentaiko was surprisingly awesome.   A little spicy, and really really good.  The only thing I had any issue with at all was that the deep fried shrimp heads were just a touch on the greasy side, and I couldn't see the eyes.  ;)  Other than that, I was extremely pleased.  Service was top notch.  Polite, and timely, with only a minor delay getting dessert, but that's because they were absolutely packed, when they hadn't been 30 minutes prior.    I will absolutely be back here again.",

We waited an hour for a table here because I wanted to see if this place was as good as everyone raves and says is so good. Well my friends I can tell you I wasn't impressed. The knife cuts on the sushi were terrible, the rolls were full of rice and the service was super slow. I was surprised to see not many rolls I liked or was eager to try. The nigiri was pretty alright but I wouldn't drive all the way there for nigiri when I could go elsewhere. Granted it was busy but we've had better service. For a place that had excellent reviews this place was a huge letdown.",

    "text": "This is the Holly Grail of Sushi in Las Vegas.  First there is the quality of the Fish. Exceptionally Fresh. They give you a generous portion of fish, and just a little rice, so if you have come here to enjoy fish, they won't try and spoil the experience by filling you up on Rice.  My wife, who favors cooked food, has said that the \"cooked food\" here is better than her two previous places, and has no arguement about making this our number one place to go.   Sitting at the Sushi Bar is an enjoyable experience. The Chefs will interact, and will try to give anticipate what you will like, always making good reccomendations. When I tell them \"Chef's choice\" for my next call, it's something I have never tried, and I am not disappointed.   The help and servers; always making the rounds and anticipating your needs. Even sitting at the table in a crowded place, I never had to \"send up a signal flare\" to track down a server. Food service was prompt, and orders were always right.   It is priced at about the going rate in town, $26.95, and I think it's a very good value.   A minor thing; All the help are English Speaking, and it is a good balanced mix of both men and women. Sounds like a minor point, but this helps assure your order will be right, and that a gir wasn't just hired for her looks, and thus may be flirting with a group of guys, while you wait for service.   Why not a Five Star? Because if you go after 5 pm, you will have a wait, usually 30 minutes. It's nice that they are busy, because you want to see them continually succeed, but it's kind of a bummer waiting that long to sit down.   As of this date, this is my new home for Sushi.  To my friend, Clint, you're not jumping on a band wagon, just being smart, and your review is justified.",

To start off there were 3-4 server/ hostess right at the front who did not even acknowledge we were waiting until another couple walked and in and reminded them that we were there first . They're usually really good about greeting you so it threw me off that even what looked to be the owner stood ignoring us and walked away. The fish did not seem fresh ! Me and my bf both got all you can eat due to the fact that we were starving but unfortunately after just two corses were done . We order garlic edamame wich seems to be from a bag that they sale at Walmart it was stale and hard I had a couple of pieces and was over it. We also ordered garlic tuna nigiri , seared tuna and seared salmon . I love salmon but my first bite was enough to make me gag. It was hot on the outer sides of the piece and frozen in the middle the texture in my mouth as I chewed  really made me nauseous. After that I was ready to go but being that I knew we would be charged 60 because we had already told the server that we'd do all you can eat I decided to order dessert wich was ok not 60$ worth but definitely killed my craving for sushi . I don't think we'll be back anytime soon or at all .",

    "text": "My first time EVER at an all you can eat (AYCE) sushi place. I was not disappointed!  We walked in at about 5pm on a Thursday afternoon. The restaurant was fairly full but we only had to wait a few minutes for them to clear off our table (party of four). Arriving at an \"in-between\" time (late lunch, early dinner) turned out to be a good idea, because towards the end of our meal about an hour later the place was packed and there was a line.   The AYCE price was $26.95 per person for dinner (lunch price is only $21.95. Guess who's coming back for lunch soon?) The AYCE includes everything on the menu besides drinks. Appetizers, miso soup, grilled items, salads. Even dessert! Unlimited dessert! What. A. Deal. I seriously spent most of my time looking at the menu while I ate, trying to decide what I was going to order next.   My advice would be to order as many things as you want at once, because it does get busy and food takes a little while to come out. There's an hour limit on dinner, so you want to spend more time eating than waiting. Keep in mind, though, that they will charge for leftovers including rice, so only order what you can eat.   We tried a few rolls. I liked the one called Sexy Girl. Nigiri is delicious...get the ahi and the unagi because both are spectacular. Also, please be sure to try the pork belly off the \"grill\" portion of the menu, because it just melts in your mouth. Faaaaaabulous, dahhling. Like everyone says, the rice to fish ratio is great and you can get the 8 piece rolls in half orders so that you can try more things before you tap out. Everything tastes fresh and is well-flavored.  Other things we tried were the calamari, takoyaki, sashimi salad, tempura, crab roll, shumai (fried and steamed) and the rice cracker, not to mention practically all of the different nigiri on the menu.   For dessert we had the azuki ice cream, green tea ice cream (mochi and regular), strawberry mochi ice cream, yuzu sorbet (my first time having this. It's a citrus sorbet and it is very light and refreshing), and the tempura ice cream. Tempura wasn't quite crispy on that one but it was still good.   Bottom line: Get the AYCE and make sure everyone on your table has it so that you can all share.  It is so worth your money. The wait staff is attentive and the atmosphere is casual, and you will definitely enjoy yourself whether you are a sushi snob or a fusion fan. It's quality sushi to your heart's content. Five stars, Sushi Goyemon!",

However,  I had to get up from my chair to approach our hostess to refill our drinks and give us some more ginger which she gave us very little of when she delivered our food. I get that they're busy during our visit but at least check up on customers. I've been at their establishment where it was busier and received good service. It was not so busy where they could not accommodate their customers. It didn't help that her personality is not enthusiastic enough, but accompanied by her lack of customer service, it just was not a good combination on her part. The management, for the caliber that their establishment, should be more prepared to have enough staff to accommodate customers. They charge good money for the food at their place but they do not back it ip with the service that paying customers should be getting for their money. I am disappointed with Goyemon House this time around but hopefully they could remedy this very soon.",

We sat at the bar and were entertained by the chef's banter in Spanish slang. There are a couple of tables outside but I personally wouldn't do that because of our strong winds.. They have a photo menu for over 40 specialty rolls so you really know what to expect. We ordered the Super Salmon and the Ecstasy rolls. Absolutely delicious. The waiters were really nice and patient with us even though we took forever to order.  My favorite part of the meal was the seaweed salad. I always have one when we go for sushi and usually they are very small. Theirs is averagely priced and so big I had no problem sharing, and it had it's own distinct taste. They also have an awesome assortment of other appetizers and plenty of desserts options. We will definitely be back here!",

That's the short version. Here's the longer version:  My sisters, fiance and I went to try Goyemon. My fiance and I had been there previously. We have noticed that they really get packed every time and there is a momentary wait for a table.   We really enjoyed our two experiences there. I took a star off specifically for their service. It is hit or miss with their service. They either accidentally overservice you or underservice you or some times bring food to the wrong table or bring you the wrong item. I'm sure in the future they will have a better protocol and perhaps create SECTIONS!  However, their fish is extremely fresh, their waiters are truly friendly and the vibe matches its hype. They do not pack on tons of rice to their sushi to try and fill you up. They really seem to want you to try everything.  Their desserts, such as the green tea creme brulee, are of utmost divinity.   They also have cooked foods such as ramen and yellowtail collar (which they run out of very fast).  There is one thing that I did not enjoy there. It's called the Screaming Orgasm. The tuna meat used in the tuna poke dish was fit for tar tar. It was a nice try to disguise leftover pieces of fish with the screaming orgasm sauce, but it was subpar for my taste.  I would say for everything they have on the menu and to only have one small complaint is a huge feat. Good job, Goyemon, and \"Go, Ye Mons\" (in old English Jamaican accent) to Goyemon to enjoy their delicious sushi.",

It may be one of the best pork belly presentations I've ever had, and it's included in the menu!    I thought that a lot of the rolls had way too much rice in them, especially the 5 piece rolls (soft shell crab)  Nothing really stood out to me, and while the quality was fine, I wasn't blown away.    For how crazy this place gets, the service is very good.  The sushi chefs must be some of the fastest in town.  There is a 60 minute time limit on dinner, which I can understand but I don't like.  Don't order too much off the big menu, you'll get charged for leftover food, even rice.    Save room for dessert, the tempura ice cream is really great.",

This place should actually be five stars considering everything that they have to offer and the fact that every single bit of it is absolutely delicious but I gave it four mainly due to the fact that I thought it was going to be a new sushi experience when it actually wasn't. They pretty much have exactly the same menu from Sushi-Mon plus a bit more so I was kind of disappointed that it was just Sushi-Mon 2.0  That little fact shouldn't discourage you from going to eat here though. As I previously stated, the food is fantastic. From the nigiri to the specialty rolls, all the way down to the sides and dessert, this place knows how to bring their A game.  If you're looking for a good sushi experience, Goyemon is an excellent place to start.  It's like 10 minutes off the strip so if you're an out of towner, this place isn't too much of a hassle to get to, although when I went there was a wait time so I would suggest calling ahead. Not sure if they do reservations but it wouldn't hurt to ask right?",

However, the service and largely the hostess service was HORRIFIC and we were NOT the only ones saying so (based on other reviews here and hearing other customers who were waiting at the same time as us).   There was a queue to give our name for a table and the hostess was running around answering the phone and doing everything BUT take our names.  We easily waited 5-10 min just to put our name down (and there was only 1 party ahead of us).  They also had a few empty tables that easily sat empty for a good 20-30 minutes before parties were sat at them.  Part of this is they allow parties to be seated even if the rest of their party is not there.  For a place that is so busy, they should not allow this. I appreciate that they take your phone number down and will call you when a table is ready.  When I've seen this at other restaurants, they usually call when a table is paying so it allows you 10 minutes to get back.  It does not make sense to call after the table is cleaned and setup because then it sits empty.  Furthermore, they should not allow tables to be sat if the whole party is not there - this avoids idle time where people are not eating and the restaurant is not making money.  I saw many parties actually leave and not bother waiting as they were as frustrated as us. IN the end, we did wait and the food was great and came fast!  Still unsure if we would come back.",

Everything about it is upscale and almost sophisticated without being ridiculously priced.   The tables are a little close together and it is easy to get caught up in another groups conversation. You should go with a mid size group of 4-6 to truly get the perfect dining experience. The menu for the all you can eat is extensive. To be able to get a full tasting you will need to share and split the duties amongst everyone. Goyemon does it's part by offering many rolls in a half portion size.   Katrina M. and I stuck mainly to the nigiri. The best were the halibut, super white tuna, scallops, and uni. I will devour four orders of halibut by myself and it was better than most places. They use less ponzu sauce on theirs which gives me the impression that there is less to hide. The super white tuna was buttery and melts in your mouth. I am pretty sure I snuck a majority of them away when no one was looking. The scallops had a squeeze of lemon that accentuated the flavors of the shellfish. The sea urchin here is delicious. They were fresh, briny, and creamy.  We had quite a few cut rolls as well. They all tasted good, but I would stick to the nigiri. The lemon roll was one that stood out above the rest. During the meal, I had wanted to order the Sushi Monster Roll. By mid meal, I was getting too full so I forgot about it. A friend ordered it while no one else was paying attention. We got it as our last roll and regretted every minute of it. One piece is the equivalent of three normal ones. The giant roll has a condense deep fried fish center wrapped in seaweed, rice, soy paper and more rice. If you have a hard time with a spider roll avoid this one. I took the challenge and stuffed the whole piece in my mouth. It was not pretty.   Save room for dessert, because it is all superb. The tofu cheesecake is rich and dense. You would never be able to guess that it was made of soy. The green tea creme brulee and cake has a mellow taste. If they allowed for it, I would do AYCE dessert.",

    "text": "I've dined at Goyemon a few times and the food here is pretty amazing. I'm particularly a fan of the garlic edamame, grilled pork belly (hands down one of the best things on their menu), hamachi nigiri, white tuna nigiri, baked mussels...the list goes on and on. The food never disappoints. I will definitely come back to this place! So why not four stars? The receptionist didn't really look like she was happy to be there and the service has room for improvement. Our orders had gotten messed up on several accounts, and because we were in a separate room (we had a party of 14) it seemed like they forgot us. The wait was about 30 minutes which is actually very fast at this place. Sometimes you can wait over an hour...but in all honesty, it's worth the wait. The $26 you pay for the All You Can Eat dinner includes: select nigiris and rolls, more than a few hot (grilled, fried, baked) items, drinks and dessert. Be sure to check the chalk board next to the sushi bar which includes daily all you can eat specials! More than worth it in my opinion!",

They have nightly specials added to their menu and I have enjoyed each one I tried- especially the yellowtail with mango! Oh so yummy! The service is decent but the sushi chefs can get a little backed up. The restaurant is also rather small and they do not take reservations so you may expect to wait a while if you go fri/sat for dinner.",

I've been to this place 3 times in the past month with different friends each time.  Everyone liked it.  I personally have had better sushi but for all you can eat this is as good as it gets in Vegas.   I love their menu.  You don't usually find sashimi salad, tuna rice cracker, orgasm salad, grilled pork belly, cold tofu, green tea creme bulee, tofu cheese cake, kobe beef (special) in the other all you can eat places.  I've also heard good things about the pork nuggets dish and the teriyaki dishes.  Thumbs up for the decent size cut and small rice portion.   I prefer Nigiri to sushi.  My favorites are salmon roe, white tuna, salmon, yellow tale, red snapper.  I'm not a uni person but my friends who eat uni said it was good.    Good service.  I didn't like the service at all on my first visit but on the last two visits we had great service.  It's not a big place so sometimes there's a wait and I'm not sure if they take reservation.  This is definitely our new favorite all you can eat place.  I hope Goyemon keeps it up!",

When you walk in, it's very hard to figure out who has already submitted their name and who is in line for the hostess.  It's also really cramped there.  We sat at the sushi bar and got the AYCE.  The sushi man behind the counter was very impressive.  My husband rattled off about 10 different nigiri and roll items and the guy didn't write any of them down.  I thought for sure he would forget some of the items, but that guy whipped them out like nobody's business.  The fish is fresh and tasty, and nigiri is really the way to go here.  The rolls are good, but the two we tried had a little too much going on and the flavors got lost in the jumble.  P.S. The pork belly is part of the AYCE.  We didn't find that out until the very end!  If we had known, we would have ordered some!",

It really is unfortunate they have such high reviews when they treat their customers like 2nd rate citizens. I've been here several times they are always rude if your party consists of more than 4 people. On the last occassion there they would not let us put 2 four top tables together for a party of 8 rather forcing us to have people both at the ends of four top & two top stuck together so our party could not all interact with each other. We even specifically asked them not to set up the table like that but were completely rude & told us we could not sit @ a table with all 4 sitting acriss from each other.  There are plenty of other great sushi places that I would rather give my hard earned money too.",

We started with garlic tuna, cajun albacore,  sweet ebi, and the tamago. The garlic tuna could have used more garlic as I thought the garlic was lacking. The cajun albacore was good. Tasted like some seasoning I had in my spice cabinet but good. The sweet ebi was also good. The tamago could be alot better, seemed as though the egg had been folded over each other to make the shape instead of being prepared that way to begin with.  We then moved on and had the orion, domingo, and the tiger rolls. The orion was good the cajun albacore made that roll spicy yet very tolerable, the domigo had to be my favorite.  The salsa that it was topped with was awesome and was a different twist from what ive had in the past. The tiger was ok. Nothing to crazy.  We then had the crispy rice, lasagna, and the spider rolls.  The spider roll was good. The soy paper was soft and the crab crunchy, very good! The crispy rice and lasagna was no spot light and was very heavy rolls with mayo, eel sauce, that just made the rolls not so appealing.  Overall place was a good time, decent food, and good service.",

Going 2 miles off the strip to eat here is well worth it. Be forewarned they are busy nonstop. We walked down from Mandalay bay and had a 45 min wait so we walked back and grabbed our car. When we returned we had our bar seat ready for us. The sushi chefs are fun to chat with and give great suggestions!  9-1-1 roll very HOT spicy.  Spicy rice cracker yum Tiger roll looked killer Hurricane & volcano excellent Orgasm salad delicious! Tofu cheesecake interesting - refreshing   Cool thing you can order half rolls so you can try so much!  $26.95/person   We will be back!!!!",

Arrive at Gomeyon and told us that the wait was for 75mins for a party of eight and we got there before 6pm. I checked back to see if the table was ready and then they told us to wait an extra 5 minutes. I checked back after 10 minutes to give them more time, table still not ready. We got seated just a little over 1hr 30min. While we were waiting outside we looked at the menu to see what we can share and listed everything on my phone so we don't miss anything and much easier to take our order. We ordered everything all one time because of the long wait, some dishes came out within 5-15mins others came out like 20-30min. Some of the orders didn't come out. Most of sushi was alright and some were good. Good price for All You Can Eat $21.95. Service was slow. Quality of the sushi is average but where can you get fresh caught fish sushi in the middle of the desert.",

The owners are also the owners of Sushi-mon on Silverado and Maryland and Fredo moved to this location.  He is still funny as usual and a great sushi chef.  Just like everyone says the food is fresh and tasty.  Pork belly is a must try. Love the grill taste to it.  You can also order all your rolls as half orders which is a plus, so that you can try out more rolls.  Tried my first Jalapeno masago nigiri(thanks Fredo) and it was awesome.  Try one with a quail egg and one without.  I didnt get to try my usual hamachi kama, due to being sold out of that and salmon kama (collar). Im sure they are both just as great as sushi-mons.  Make sure you look at the chalkboard to the right of the sushi bar for daily specials. I seen it at the end of the meal and didn't get to try them :(. We will definately go back and we will be bringing more people to enjoy this place.",

The basics that me & my hubby usually get at sushi places (tuna poke, seaweed salad, miso, etc) were very good if not BETTER than their equivalents at the other 5 or so sushi places we've tried here in Vegas. We ate at the bar and our sushi chef (I think his name was Juan, a young Hispanic man) was very attentive, polite and intelligent.  He was taking multiple orders from multiple customers at once and getting them all out quickly and accurately.  Plus, he told us something we've never hear at a sushi place before: that we could add or subtract whatever we want from the rolls on the AYCE menu and he would make them to order.  How awesome is that! And I loved that this place had many rolls with ingredients you don't see every day at the other places in town.  And all the new ones we tried were very tasty.  Oh, and there were some unique items on the dessert menu too which were also delicious! The only reason this place doesn't get 5 stars is that the servers were kind of slow. But we would definitely return for \"Juan\" and sit at the sushi bar!!!",

    "text": "Overall, one of the best AYCE sushi joints in Vegas, but disappointed that they didn't have Kobe beef and toro available for us as stated in other yelp reviews.  The quality of fish was what you'd expect for ayce, although there was a huge difference between our orders of hamachi nigiri.  First order was of high quality--nice white, fatty slices with little blood line.  So good I wanted more, but the secound round was rather poor quality--fish was breaking apart like venetian blinds, little fat content and had a large amount of the dark red bloodline. MEH.  I must say their uni and amaebi were both very fresh though. The pork is tasty--simmered for a while till it's melt-in-your-mouth, similar texture to the pork you'd find in a good ramen place.  The spicy tuna on crispy rice was good if you like yaki-onigiri, if you don't then don't get this since it is more rice than fish.  Special rolls we ordered were nothing special, dessert was nice with the green tea creme brulee & green tea ice cream.  Our server was nice, but not very attentive--we had to wait 15 minutes after our first order to put in the 2nd, even with me constantly trying to make eye contact with her.  Are you trained this way to make us full faster????  Overall, \"this sushi-mon #2\" is a nice addition to our ayce sushi choices here in vegas. If not for a disappointing round 2 of hamachi, so-so service and lack of 2 special items that made me want to try this place, it would have gotten 5 stars.",

There was a 15 minute wait, which we didn't mind because we walked to the mini mart a few stores down and bought a bottle of beer.  We requested sitting at the bar so that we can order directly from the sushi chefs.  The sushi was fresh and made quick.  There were also items that needed to be ordered from the waiter - yakitori, pork belly, udon, dessert, shumai, etc.  Everything I ordered was delicious.  There were also daily specials too.

Make sure you allow for sometime since this place gets really busy.  The sashimi(hamachi, amaebi, unagi, salmon, tuna) was very fresh.  I am not a fan of uni and we had some and it was amazingly good.  Too bad you are limited on some items.  They have a special menu and great desert menu.  The green tea crem brulee, green tea cheese cake, and green tea cake is a must have.  Actually everything is good here and they have a good selection of drinks as well.  Can't wait to go back to Vegas and stop by Goyemon for their great food.",

    "text": "A group of 5 of us went to Goyemon last night with all but one of us never being there before. We were very disappointed in the organization of \"first come first serve\" which is not entirely True considering one guest came in and said they had a reservation and the wait was half the time for a table. I was there 15 mins before the rest of my group and although there was an open table I was told I had to wait for everyone to get there. Even when everyone did arrive, we still waited to be seat though our table was sitting open in front of us. The hostess said she didn't want to overwhelm the kitchen but I thought still you could seat is and have the waitress take our drink order? We finally were seated after 10 mins. I have never be forced to stand in the way of the door with my table open right in front of me for 25 mins. The food was great but service was not. We were all worried about getting our order in before the hour window of eating because our waitress barely came to our table. At the end of the meal, we waited ten mins for someone to come take our payment and ended up walking up to the hostess stand to do it ourselves. Very disappointed in first impressions this place made. Make sure you make a reservation since it works sometimes and not others. How is that even fair?",

    "text": "Wow. Great sushi! All you can eat for 26 bucks! Make sure to get your money's worth! I came her with my girlfriend and got AYCE and we got a lot of half rolls and figured the price of the meal would just come out to the price of AYCE.  We sat at the sushi bar and had Fredo(?) as our sushi chef. Really cool guy and really friendly. He recommended things to use and everything tasted great.  YOU MUST get the grilled cajun salmon! It only comes in a small bit size so order about two for yourself. The chocolate moose was the only desert we tried and it was amazing. Also get the grilled veggies. Whatever butter they put is really tasty!! The server was great too. There's about three that bus the sushi bar and grab drinks and one of them takes your order that doesn't get made by the sushi chefs. Super quick service! If you do AYCE 10 times you get the 11th free! Oh and a Sunday night the wait was about 45 minutes for two people. The place is small and super packed. Make sure to say you will sit in either a booth or table so if either opens up you'll get seated faster",

Although things have changed a bit since it first opened (no more collar!) it is still a great choice for AYCE sushi.  My one complaint with them is that they are so busy, they can sometimes be rude with service as you are finishing up.  The host once asked us to hurry up with dessert as they were waiting to seat a large party.  No problem, I understand, but we had only been there an hour and we weren't lingering at all.  I know the rules, eat and leave, but this was over the top.   The sushi is always fresh, delicious, and at a great price for what you get so I'll keep coming back.  Our favorite is the salmon belly..practically melts in your mouth.  The big eye tuna was another one of our favorites but I haven't seen it on the menu in a while.  Overall a great place for AYCE sushi with good food at great prices.",

I arrived with 3 friends, and my 2 kids (teenager & toddler). Checked in at 6:00pm and there was only one couple ahead of us, and was told there was a 45 min wait. We decided we would wait. My girlfriend's and I have our monthly get together and decided on this place. By 7:00pm we saw more than 10 groups of people in parties of 2-4 being seated ahead of us. We figured because we had 5 people we had to wait longer. However, we noticed that tables that could have been put together for us was not being used, and eventually people with 4 or less people were being seated. We were very hungry and decided to stay because we waited this long already. By 7:10pm I asked how much longer, and the hostess informed me that they were waiting for the family of 5 to leave, and they were trying to get them out. So....they have only 1 table reserved for parties of 5 or more? Really!!!? Clearly, the family of 5 who had been dining upon our arrival was not leaving. So we continued to wait in the tiny waiting area between the front door and the hostess station. BY 7:20pm the hostess came up to us and said she had to work her magic, and began to open a door  leading to a more private dining area meant for large groups!! This whole time that we were waiting to be seated no one in the restaurant (staff or management) thought of opening this magic door?!! They made us wait over an hour to make the executive decision? I get it if there is a long wait, and people are seated in order of arrival or if staff has to wait for 2 tables to become available (which clearly was available while we waited), but to make us wait that long to decide to seat us, and we felt like our order of arrival was not a factor.  So we were just happy to finally be able to sit and eat (especially the 2 kiddos who waited patiently). Now the customer service...the ladies that took our order seemed rushed to get us out of there. They appeared to be bothered every time they came to take our order and deliver food. Maybe they were all having a bad day or whatever, but the rudeness was from everyone was really unnecessary. No attention at all to waters or tea needing to be filled.  Can you please ask me if I am done before you take my half eaten bowl of sashimi salad away? I am sorry to say that I probably won't return. We should have just stuck to our regular AYCE sushi place on Flamingo & Durango. At least we gave it a shot and I can say it wasn't worth the wait, the attitude, and the food. If you decide to give this place a try I hope you don't have the experience that we did.",

This place is always busy so get here early if you dont to wait too long.  The only reason why I didnt give it a 5 star, is that the last time I came in the hostess was so cold and rude to my family and I.  She was not friendly, when we asked a question it seemed like she would not want to talk to us, and her body language was down right rude.  I understand it was a busy night, but she should be able to still be friendly.  It made many of my family members uncomfortable.  Everything else in the restaurant was awesome, but you know have that hostess just to lighten up.",

    "text": "One of the best AYCE Sushi restaurant in Las Vegas.  Reservations highly recommended if you have a party of 10 or more (that is the minimum for reservations). 15 to 20 for the Tatami Room. Check out their daily specials board.  Plum Wine Jelly is awesome, Lychee Sorbet makes a good palette cleanser between orders of sushi.  One the main reason that this is a great AYCE sushi dinner spot in Las Vegas, is that everything on the menu is AYCE (except sashimi).  That includes the daily specials board, the hot apps and dessert selections on the placemats.  All they ask is you finish what you order and not waste food.  Sounds fair to me!  I am not going to review every single item I have tried over the last dozen visits.  But as great as this place is to dine at, the experience can totally be improved if you got with a few friends.  At least this way you can try more things on the menu before you have to throw up the white flag, wiggle your tummy and find a little more room for the desserts.  Even if you are not into raw fish as some of your buddies are, there are plenty of cooked items available for you to order. You can dine here with your foodie buddies without having to feel left out.  The staff here is great!  Even when they are slammed (pretty much anytime after 7pm) they still managed to deliver on good or better service.  Just show up early or have some patience, as the average wait here for dinner is at least an hour.  Food: 4.5/5 The food and the selection is very good.  Flavor: 4.5/5 Overall very very good, although some nigiri are drenched in too much ponzu sauce.  Service: 5/5 I have never had a bad experience here.  Decor:  4.5 Pretty trendy and there are decorative samurai swords in the loo.  Parking: 4.5/5 The parking lot is not super big, but you can usually find a parking spot when you drop in for dinner.  Price:  4/5  Comparable to other local AYCE sushi restaurants in Las Vegas.  Value:  5/5  Only sashimi is not available as part of AYCE.  Their available selection is crazily extensive.  4.5 stars easily!",

Sashimi, nigiri, robata, and sushi rolls all made to order w/ a great selection of apps and salad to choose from as well.  Food is tasty and the fishes are always the color it should be, they do not serve you stuff that has been sitting out for days.  There is a limit on certain more expensive nigiri items (uni, fresh scallop, amaebi) each person is allowed, but with the great selections Goyemon offers, you will hardly notice the limitation.  Even if you're not a sushi lover, there's still plenty of cooked food options you can choose from so definitely do not be discouraged by this place.  Miso black cod and pork belly are 2 dishes worth trying, along with all their yummy grilled vegetables.  Come after 11pm and you can even indulge in their AYCE ramen from their sister restaurant, Monta.    Be sure to save room for dessert though as they have a great selection to choose from!  They usually rotate their offerings by season, but their green tea creme brulee, green tea cake, and mochi ice cream are almost always available year round.      Service can be hit or miss, but put your name down and have them call you when your table is ready.  If you are renting a car, it's best that you drive here, write down your name, and venture to the other strip malls near by.  If not, taking a cab from the strip is still worth it.  Just be sure you don't come here when you are already starving and hangry, come w/ a light stomach and be prepared to wait at least 30 mins.  Happy eating!",

    "text": "What a way to begin a weekend in Las Vegas. I've been craving great sushi (and lots of it) so man, did Goyemon hit the spot even better than I was expecting after such rave reviews from local friends.  We arrived shortly after opening last Friday (between 11:45am and noon) and were able to get a table for our group of 5. It filled up quickly after that while we were eating. Our drink orders were quickly taken and we started sizing up the AYCE menu.  Here's where I kinda take issue: Usually at AYCE sushi, the table is given a paper where we mark off the items we want with tallymarks for different rounds as we decide what we want, and then we order a second round once we've received our items from the first. Here, the waitstaff takes orders like a traditional sushi restaurant. I don't like this for 3 reasons: I ordered plain edamame and miso soup, which I like to start the meal with (both). I got these items at the very end of my meal, when I kind of didn't even want them anymore. I even had to ask our waitress where the edamame was and she just said it was on the way. We were already on the second bottle of sake.  My second problem with the waitstaff ordering method rather than the paper with the tallymarks is that there were things people wanted to share, and it was really hard to keep track of how many of each thing were wanted - the waitress implied she had a system but looking over her shoulder at her notepad, I didn't see anything that made sense. We happily ate everything, but I would be mildly annoyed if we were missing orders of nigiri or given too many of something, especially something that we only wanted a small taste of (like say, uni).  My third problem with this style of ordering is making sure we received everything and confirming what things are since I like to be adventurous. We had ordered some squid and the folks who wanted it tried what they were thinking was squid. Then something that was much more obviously the squid came out. What had they eaten earlier? The world may never know. But with a form left at the table, we could have figured that out somehow.  Ok! Back to positives. The quality of the food was fantastic. I got a shrimp head in my miso that added to the flavor and gave it such umami, I was in heaven. The fish was so fresh and there was a really nice fish to rice ratio on the nigiri (mostly what we ordered). I hate when places go crazy with the rice for AYCE so you fill up. This place made the pieces like usual so you could really enjoy the fish.  Here's the nigiri we ordered (and my comments if I ate it): tuna (maguro): delicious and fresh garlic tuna: tasty but the garlic sauce didn't really add too much, so I'd skip it for plain super white tuna: OH MY GOD GET THIS IT'S PHENOMENAL yellowtail (hamachi): another great fresh fish here, refreshing and tasty salmon (sake): my favorite, an old standby and Goyemon did not disappoint seared salmon: a new favorite, the searing adds a beautiful dimension and meatiness snow crab meat: meh, it was good but I keep trying crab and keep not loving it as much as other seafoods so I should stop trying fresh water eel: GET IN MY MOUTH so meaty and the sauce is so sweet and perfect  A couple rolls were ordered by the table - I tried a bit of the Ecstasy roll and it was good but I wasn't expecting the \"orgasm sauce\" to have a kick to it, and I'm not a fan of spicy sauce.  We also got the yellowtail collar that's not included in the AYCE and is hot and eaten with a garlicky sauce and OMG. Without the sauce it's really bland and dry but the sauce brings out a flavor profile that's orgasmic. It's umami and savory and melt in your mouth, the seafood dreams are made of. I just wanted more of it than the small flakes we could pull out with our chopsticks.  The service, besides the weird ordering and waiting forever for a couple of things, was attentive and polite, my diet coke was regularly refreshed and it was never hard to flag someone down with a question. Overall, I loved this place despite the weird timing. I will 10000% be back the next time I'm in Vegas and like every time after, I'll just make sure I request that I get my miso and edamame before any of the fish I order.",

We sat at the bar and the service from the chefs and servers were very attentive even though it was a packed night.   If you want to know that you're getting good quality fish, this is the place to go! They don't just cover their fish in a ton of sauce, you can actually taste it.",

    "text": "Felt slightly dissatisfied after my other all you can eat sushi dinner at Hikari, I finally returned to Goyemon. It was overall a much better experience and actually restored some faith I have in Vegas AYCE/buffet meals.  The atomsphere was very inviting and the service was friendly. It was only slightly after 6 but the restaurant was already at capacity. Our server was busy but service was still attentive. We had no trouble placing orders after orders and food came out really quickly.   The sushi was good. Not the top tier out there but above average. Nigiri are authentic and perfectly sized to fit in one bite. Some of the presentation appeared rushed but still excusable. For AYCE standard I think I could consider that stellar quality. The fish quality is decent and the selection is good. Don't forget to ask your server about their daily specials. They had Japanese snapper and white clam that night and those were nice. Amaebi, hamachi, albacore and super white tuna were all quite memorable. The ikura, uni and hotate, however, were just average. The uni, even though it is limited 1 order per person, was not nearly as good as those I had at Hikari. Nothing really stood out among the appetizers and fusion rolls. The pork belly was just alright. Not good enough for a second order. Offering homemade desserts was definitely a huge plus. Love their chocolate mousse cake.  If you like AYCE and you love sushi, bookmark Goyemon for your next Vegas trip.",

My friends left the decision making up to me on where to eat and I think after this experience, they wont anymore.   The customer service is mainly the reason to why I rated Sushi House of Goyemon low. You can also see from some fellow yelpers about their similar experience. For us, we were hardly waited on. They seemed very annoyed to our requests and questions about what they have on the menu. It's also funny how the server told us straight off the bat we have 45 minutes to order with all you can eat. To top it off, they gave us our checks and it literally took more than 30 minutes to take our payment. No lie we could of easily walked out of the restaurant without paying and they would have not even noticed. I had to walk up to one of the workers near the cooking station to tell her if they would like our money. Sounds funny. But Smh.   As for the food, it was good. I was bummed that the miso soup wasn't even hot, especially with this crazy cold weather! However, I did like the crispy spicy tuna roll, hurricane roll, and the tempura ice cream. That is all.",

It was nicely charred and the flavor bursted right from the fat! The sauce that it came in was a little too good ... I caught my bf with his eyes rolled in the back of his head a few times. Needless to say he enjoyed the majority of this dish all by himself.  The BBQ Beef ribs were also really flavorful and saucy- goes perfect with  the white rice... Has a Teriyaki BBQ flavor.  The Fried California roll was pretty good. Perfectly done. Not mushy at all on the inside.  The Japanese Lasagna roll had a nice little baked crunch under the cream cheese topping. Down to the last bite. Impressive!  The Shoyu Ramen was different.  Should've known this one was going to be a bust after we asked the waitress what different flavor ramen bowls they have and she said \"we're not a ramen house so we only have 1 ramen bowl.\" Ok cool, well then what flavor is that one? She didn't know. Anyway, Wouldn't order it again but it was worth a try. Too many indescribable flavors.  Overall nothing was bad. It was average. The wait was 45 minutes though.",

I was seated and place my order for all you can eat with the waitress. After 15 mins nothing was served except the beer, not even the miso soup. I asked another gentleman for my order and restated it assuming he was a waiter, he was everywhere helping everyone while the two women laughed and puttered around. After I finished my first helping I waited again for them to check on me no one came. At this point I went to the counter and asked can I place my order here, they seemed alarmed and asked the server why she didn't take my order. I sat down and one waitress walked past me looking at me harshly. She came by to take the order of the gentleman next to me and I called out to gain her attention, she ignored me and kept walking. The African American couple sitting the table over pointed at her skin and she said the lady had done the same to her. At this point I got up and went again to the table and told them how bad the service is for an AYCE sushi restaurant. I placed another round and it was served promptly at this point. The gentleman I assumed was a waiter came by to apologize. He stated he was not a server but a busser. I thanked him for his strong sense of urgency and tipped him, I also stated it's a shame that you are out working the servers and you care about the services. I love sushi restaurants, but this place needs to reevaluate how they treat customers especially people of color.",

Went on Mother's Day weekend and there was an hour long wait, not surprised.  The place is small and could be bigger but it is a really nice comfy intimate restaurant. Sushi was really good, I personally recommend J.J, Pete's, Tiger Eye and the green tea ice cream!  Lunch was around $22 bucks, not too bad for all you can eat. Will definitely come back during my next Vegas trip.",

    "text": "This is my first Yelp review, although for this particular location I've been here countless times. But the reason for my review & five stars was the sushi chef my boyfriend and I had for the night named Gian. Once we were seated, he greeted us asking if we've dined with them before. After a few moments of looking at the menu, we knew what we wanted to order.   - Ecstasy roll - Lemon roll - Jala Jala roll (1/2) - 911 roll (1/2) - Salmon nigiri - Tuna nigiri - Yellowtail nigiri - Amaebi nigiri - Miso soup - Octopus poke - Baked mussels - Garlic edamame  During us ordering, Gian asked if we've ever tried the yellowtail w/ ponzu & jalapenos or garlic tuna nigiri, to which we responded no. But we agreed to try because he mentioned it was his personal favorites.   Both of his recommendations were great! It took the simplicity of the nigiri and kicked it up a notch. Between my boyfriend & I, I think I can speak for the both of us that if between those two recommendations if you pick just one to try... Go with the yellowtail w/ ponzu & jalapenos. It's a mix of flavors that blends so well & no matter how much of it you eat, it's not an overpowering flavor.   We've been to Goyemon a lot. There is almost always a long wait because of how busy they are and sometimes we don't get checked on as much because of the traffic, but sitting at the bar that night really made us appreciate our dinner & the chef for anticipating our needs. Sometimes it just takes that one person to change your outlook on something so you don't leave with a bitter taste in your mouth.",

The Uni and Halibut alone was worth the price of admission along w/ the Green Tea Brulee dessert which is included. I tried Abalone for the first time here and really hated it and I'm not sure if Abalone is always that chewy and rubbery with that odd flavor but that's the last time I'll have that. It was like eating a tire.   Otherwise, awesome gluttonous experience. I think the key is to make sure to order from the specials on the board as with most sushi bars since it's usually a choice and seasonal offering. It's not \"blow your mind\" sushi, but it satisfies the craving and there's an abundance to choose from. Definitely on our radar to go to when in Vegas for another foodie adventure.",

    "text": "People know Las Vegas by many names, but to me it has just one: America's AYCE playground. Sadly, like a rusted out merry go round covered in bird droppings, Sushi House Goyemon is a ride worth skipping.  My first experience here, despite the 30 minute wait for a table, was pleasant enough to earn a return trip... And that's where the fairy tale ends.   This time the wait was 1 hour and the service was extremely slow.  Like walking-on-your-hands-through-a-tarpit slow. Not sure if it was due to the fact they only hand two servers waiting on the entire place, and also playing hostess... Or the fact the sushi chefs seemed to lumber behind the bar with the urgency of a toddler on his way to the dentist.   Either way, it took 30 minutes for our first order to reach the table... And 35 more minutes for the second. Keep in mind each order was just 8 pieces of nigiri.  Looking around the restaurant was flat out depressing, every table experiencing the same level of disappointment, and starvation. We waited for our last order, a salmon skin hand roll for 40 minutes before giving up and vacating our table to make room for their next victim. First time I've ever left an AYCE sushi joint still hungry.  One star for the unapologetically bad service, and potentially tarnishing Las Vegas's AYCE superiority.",

Lately, not so much anymore. We have noticed since Gio no longer works here that there may have been some kind of employee shake up. The morale now seems depressed and it really shows on some of the front of house employees. Tonight I was totally disgusted with the hostess and the Japanese female server with glasses. We were not greeted by a friendly hostess, and the server was not friendly either. She took our initial order and never came back until I had to ask if we could order more food. This is an AYCE sushi house! Or isn't it? When she took our second round of orders it was like we were disgusting her and it wasn't much. She did not even refill our water cups or drinks. Soon after we finished our first round of food, the hostess asked if we were all done? Really? We were sitting there looking around and never saw this place with so many open tables. Maybe people caught on faster than we did. Service has gone severely downhill. Warning to the owner, there's a lot of competition out there. We sure miss Gio. We walked in, he knew our beverages and always came to say hello. He made everyone feel welcome and the place had a happy aura. Not anymore. We got into our car, drove off and we all sadly said, I don't care to come back anymore. Sad. I hope you can repair the great reputation you once had.   Sincerely, A new loyal customer to Soho Japanese restaurant on Jones/Warm Springs.",

Like cops in a donut shop or Hispanics in a taqueria, that's how you know the food is good.",

The fact that our waitress only came to our table once to get our drink order and never came back. Had to wave down another waitress to get our food ordered. Once we got our appetizers it was bland n cold, their Nigiri's dry, the rolls were off tasting as if they over cooked the eel sauce & the baked rolls just awful had to return them because it was burnt.  Who serves anything burnt?? Didn't have an appetite for anything they had after that. It was honestly a waste of time & money. Had to eat somewhere else.",

    "text": "I can't believe I have yet to review Goyemon. Since moving to Vegas 7 months ago, my husband and I have filled up not one, not two but THREE punch cards here. We brought my parents and one of our friends here when they visited from IL, on two separate occasions, and were met with rave reviews each time. Goyemon really has the BEST AYCE sushi anywhere, ever!  Sure, we have experienced one or two service hiccups in the past. Yes, they refuse to put wasabi on the nigiri. Yeah, if you come at the wrong time, you will have to wait, FOREVER. But though I tend to be a harsh critic, I can't give them anything less than 5 stars because the food is always SO delicious and I promise you it is worth the wait. Their selection is also huuuge and they always have a variety of specials (we always get really excited when we see salmon belly on the menu), and I have never had fish here that was anything less than fresh and delicious!  If your sushi tooth can only be satisfied by mound after mound of tasty, tasty fish, Goyemon is the place to be. This is one instance where the quality of the fish does not suffer in an AYCE setting. And if you're not a fish fan, you won't go hungry, either! There are tons of side/appetizer items to choose from, including some unbelievably tasty pork belly, and if you come after 11pm, you can have a bowl of hot, delicious ramen. YAY Goyemon. I look forward to filling up my fourth punch card... maybe this weekend...",

    "text": "The Husband and I have been anxious awaiting our turn to check out this newly popular AYCE sushi joint in the southwest part of town and we finally got a chance last week!  (After all, this location once housed Sushi Hana and SHIN Yakitori.)  Open only for dinner from 5:00 pm to 3:00 am, we made it our mission to be waiting when the doors open.  We weren't the only ones on a Sunday night to think of this, but were definitely glad we did.  Beyond the standard sushi rolls and sushi, what makes Sushi House Goyemon a star higher than others?  These were noteworthy in my book:  * Specials board: Oh my goodness!  This is what got me!  They had off the standard menu fish like bonito, kampachi, sardines, and yuzu tobiko that were included in AYCE.  That was definitely a highlight in my book!  Loving the yuzu tobiko!  * Pork Belly - Yes, everyone talks about it and it's good stuff.  We love pork belly - we have marinated cooked pork belly sitting in our freezer ready to throw into the rice cooker at a moment's notice.  We love pork belly.  Sure, the portion is a meager two pieces at a time, but it's AYCE, so order up more!  * Shoyu Ramen is included in AYCE after 11 pm.  Sure, we missed this, but it got the Husband all excited with the possibility of it.  (Why someone would want to fill their belly with ramen and soup during an AYCE sushi fest is beyond me.)  * Dessert included, as in ALL the desserts are included!  I've been to other AYCE sushi joints that may or may not included AYCE ice cream, but they not only have a few ice cream flavors, but four different desserts to choose from.  Uh, score a point there!  We tried them all - Green Tea Cake, Chocolate Mousse, Plum Wine Jelly, and Green Tea Creme Brulee.  * Hot or Iced Green Tea is included.  So, what's with all the mixed reviews?  The major problem here is service.  I read over the recent reviews and took note of the declining service and definitely can attest to what the other yelpers are complaining about.  We were lucky that Chizuru was our primary waitress because she is stellar.  And the rest of the staff, that's the problem.  From the moment we walked in and said party of four and one highchair, the hostess/waitress totally forgot to bring a highchair.  Other staff people were just not attentive, as I was often seen waving my arms around to get their attention.  Waiters who refill your beverages should really put your glass back in front of you, not at the other end of the table and watch you struggle to reach across to get it.  There are just some people who are just really good at restaurant service and others that could use some improvement  Nonetheless, we've been gone so long from the AYCE world that we are happy to go back.  Yeah, we'll be back this week!  4.5 stars.  They offer a frequent eater card, which is always nice.  Looks like they are related to Sushi Mon and Monta Ramen as well.  Good to know!  They also take reservations for their party room from 10-20 people.  Last seating for AYCE is 2:00 am!",

Even checked out some of the other people's pics and I had to say the pics looked pretty impressive. Well then I got here. With the friend who hyped it up I might add, and I gotta say what a let down.  No wagyu/Kobe beef sushi. No salmon belly. The sushi to rice ratio was pretty sorry as well. I was expecting a hell of a lot more. In actuality, I'm giving the stars primarily for the AYCE mochi ice cream and the pork belly. Those were pretty damn good. But the sushi was average at best. Now I'm not sure if I got there on a bad day, what the deal was but it was a letdown. I'll give it a shot on another day maybe but the sushi I was served looked nothing like the pictures that I seen people post on here.",

The grilled pork belly is also a nice addition to the AYCE. This place is the same owners as sushi mon on maryland pkwy, so you can use the same stamp card at either location. I must say that Goyemon is so much better. I have gotten to know alot of the workers there because some of them are from sushi mon.  I think that the service is top notch and the sushi is even better!!!! Give then a try and you wont be sorry. Just and FYI the shoyu ramen is not available until after 11pm on the AYCE... It does get crowded so try to get there early but this place is really worth the wait... enjoy",

Waiting wasn't a big deal, but this FAT UGLY HOSTESS NAMED LESILIE out of nowhere had some attitude issues acting like she owns the restaurant or something. I mean, damn almost walked out of the restaurant because of her attitude. Waiting an hour was bad enough but a hostess who doesn't even know how to seat people in right order is messed up.

However, he has a baby and set the airconditioner at 80 degrees when the temp outside was well over 100. I couldn't bare another night so I left his pad, and was driving home, but this place was on the way. I stopped by late night, which is fine, because this place closes at 3 am. The best all you can eat sushi in las vegas.",

I've been probably 20 times and the sushi is always fresh and very good compared to other AYCE places (I generally avoid AYCE sushi as the quality is generally poor). Rolls are good too. You can order anything off the menu and they often have seasonal specials.  If you go, definitely get the cod appetizer, spicy tuna on sticky rice, baked mussels, salmon kama (collar), moment roll, spider roll, your favorite nigiri, and their nice selection of desserts  I've been quite a few times and have only been disappointed by their miso soup (basic is terrible, the shrimp head miso is ok), and their terriyaki.  Goyemon is always busy but rarely has a long wait and is open late for night owls like me.",

    "text": "I had pretty high expectations going in and is sad to say that it does not live up to the hype. I've heard that Goyemon used to be great but here are my honest review while trying to keep it unbiased.  Ambiance: Great and nicely decorated placeyet too small to even enjoy a conversation with my mom without overhearing he next table. (Hearing profanity during a meal is not appetizing) I recommend removing a table even if it means potential loss in profits.  Service: Kind servers but we did have to wait a fair bit for them to come around. Could be due to our party of two or maybe a server short.   Food: Absolutely disappointing. While appetizers seem to be decent we thought some of the dishes were just too salty. (That's coming from a Korean family who uses liberal amounts of salt in cooking) Good sushi preparation does not require a heavy salt use.   Tl;dr - Salty/dry dishes, small cramped ambiance, and average service. I think the best part of the experience was Jaime :) Probably won't ever return as it's the worst place I've been to out of 8 sushi bars I've been to in Vegas",

Showed up at 1:15 to be sat with 5 people while there were 3 other tables were dining and we were turned away. First said they had to ask the chef for permission and then saying they no longer do all you can eat after 12. So disappointing. We went to Lee's all you can eat Korean bbq we will never be back and sushi mon is less than a minute from our house. So sad so disappointed",

Our personal top three items are Salmon Belly, Albacore and Cajun Salmon. Pay attention to the board in the restaurant as most of the recommendations are incredibly delicious. We would also recommend going for dinner as some of the most delicious items are served only during dinner.  Goyemon can be extremely packed at times. We have never been there and not had to wait but it is well worth the wait.  We love all the nigiri ! We love Goyemon!",

    "text": "The wait to get into here was long for a table, but when we walked in, the sushi bar had plenty of seats open so we made a beeline straight for it!  If you're going to have more than 2 or 3 rolls, you MUST go for the All-you-can-eat deal for $26.95 for dinner (or $21.95 for lunch).    I'm not sure why there were so many complaints from fellow yelpers about service, but service at the sushi bar was top notch!  I'm guessing if you get the seats towards the right end of the sushi bar you will be right there in the traffic lanes where the servers pickup orders.  Also, as soon as you give the chef your order, it only takes a few minutes before you get handed some beautifully presented sushi delectables!    If sushi is not your thing, they have the dinner combos that are really, really reasonably priced for the amount of food that you get!  A chicken teriyaki and shrimp tempura dinner special was just under $11!",

    "text": "Sushi Goyemon is a great place to visit if you want to get your late night sushi fix on! While it seems they are best known for their all you can eat sushi, they have a lot more to offer as we learned during our visit.   We decided against the all you can eat for about $26 option since none of us were that hungry and because you only get an hour. I eat pretty slowly, so I doubted I'd be able to get my money's worth, particularly seeing as their rolls are reasonably priced and average at about $9-$10.   I went with the crispy tempura shrimp, teriyaki chicken and a tempura fried roll with salmon and cream cheese called the \"Taylor Roll\". The roll was nice and flavorful and reminded me of the \"Vegas Roll\" I've had at other places.  I also stole a couple pieces of my friend's salmon on salmon roll, which was just delicious. The salmon was bright pink, wonderfully fatty, and so soft and smooth.   The crispy tempura shrimp were perfect with a light, crisp batter on the outside and sizeable, plump, juicy shrimp within. The included dipping sauce was also great.   Overall, we all enjoyed our meals and each got out for less than $20, which is incredible considering how much food we had.  I wanted to make room for the tempura fried ice cream, but just couldn't do it. Next time for sure!",

    "text": "With so many AYCE sushi restaurants in Las Vegas, it's hard to say if Goyemon is my favorite but it's definitely up there! I always get nigiri and I find that Goyemon has one of the best quality fish. I recommend the super white tuna, Cajun albacore, and yuzu yellowtail. Their fish to rice ratio is perfect and food comes out quick. They have yummy rolls and while this might not be a lot of peoples cup of tea, my fave is the lemon roll which is really refreshing - a nice contrast to all the other heavier rolls.   My only complaint is service, I just wish the servers were more attentive. When they get busy, it's so hard to flag down your server. One time, we couldn't find our server through the last half of our meal and the next time she checked in on our table, she was telling us that our time limit was up. We didn't even order everything we wanted to order because she was gone half the time so that was quite frustrating.   Other than that, food quality here is great and it's easy to see why Goyemon is busy all the time!",

The thing is, I've eaten at enough sushi restaurants that I've become an \"adventurous\" eater. I look for unique creations other than your typical rainbow and caterpillar roll, and quite frankly, Goyemon doesn't stray too far from the basics. They have a solid amount of original rolls, but only a small number had descriptions that were enticing enough to try.   What I really appreciate about Goyemon is that they make half rolls on request. I have a bad habit of scarfing down whole rolls and becoming full too quickly, so the half rolls allowed me to pace my AYCE appetite and sample a variety from their menu.  *Recommended items: - Salmon and White Tuna Nigiri (order 10!!) - Moon Roll (eel, scallop, avocado, eel sauce) - Baked Mussels - Crab Meat Hand Roll (simple, yet delish)",

As it is a few dollars cheaper and the only two things you are missing is the one order of uni and one order of amaebi.   The portions are on the smaller side for the nigiri, but the rolls are a good size. The quality of the fish is good and comparable to other sushi places. However, the reason we like coming to this place is that most all you can eat places don't come with special items for the day and desserts. So we like coming here because we know that even for an all you can eat place, there still will be something new to try.",

Nowhere on their door or policies does it say \"last seating for all you can eat is at 2 a.m. and all of your party has to be here in order to do ayce.\" Erving is the worst manager and is not accommodating at all. I was sitting at the table before 2 a.m. and he waited until 2 a.m. to greet me so that I couldn't get the option to do ayce. Then he continued to tell me that I couldn't have ayce bc my friend wasn't sitting with me at the table by 2 a.m. Soooo I asked if I could do it since I was there on time and my friend was gonna do ala carte. He tried to say that I wasn't here on time when I had proof that I was lol. Pathetic.  What's the point of being open until 3 a.m. if you pretty much stop service at 2 a.m.? So worthless. I would go anywhere else if there were more sushi places open late. Starve yourself and wait until the next day when a better sushi restaurant is open haha. Don't waste your time here.

It still blows my mind how fresh the fish is considering we are in the desert. Not a single bad item on the menu. Good price for good quality food. What more is there to say.  We got the lychee sake and that stuff is deadly. Not too sweet and delicious. I don't drink often but I had several tea cups of this stuff. Highly recommend to pair it with your meal.  At the end of the meal you get AYCE ice cream and they have mochi ice cream! Can't beat that. Definitely a place I will be returning to next time I'm back in Vegas.",

Didn't have the luxury of Jane K or Nik O suggesting what to order this time but thankfully Chris V made some excellent suggestions.    Lots of parking in the strip mall.  At around 6 most of the tables were taken but the sushi bar had space for us.  Tried a couple of rolls and ordered a few appetizers at first.  Noticed that the hand rolls had proportionally more rice than the larger rolls and that the larger rolls had proportionally more rice than the nigiri so ended up only ordering nigiri after that.  Highlights: maguro ahi, white tuna, and (best of all) unagi eel nigiri.  The shrimp tempura was a good side but the pork belly was too fatty and the fried shumai tasted like the frozen stuff.  Tried the vanilla creme (pretty good) and ice cream tempura (never again) but by then was so full we should have left already.  It probably would have been maybe $10 more per person if we ordered ala carte but honestly we would not have eaten as much so maybe AYCE sushi isn't for me. :(",

Service:  First of all, the it isn't even busy, yet the front girl is having a horrible attitude. She didn't greet me, just stood there and told me' you can sit after the bus boy clean that table'. ( the bus boy is actually the only one who is doing excellent job! Kudos to you!) The rest of the meal the girl didn't speak any words to me. When I waved to her asking for miso soup, she grunted 'mm' and walked away silently when I said thank you. Everyone's face is like today is a shitty day.    Food:  Horrible food. Undercooked over-sourish rice is jammed pack under warm, dry, skimpy fish. The miso soup I got was basically hot water! I have never seen such transparent miso! Super amazed! The wasabi and ginger maybe had been left outside on the counter since yesterday night. And since I'm writing this review while I'm still sitting here eating, I'm proud to tell you their rice is now even HOTTER! And most of the table left with only few rounds of order. My huge glass of water ( I usually don't finish my water but I had been needing them to wash down some very weirdly strong flavored food) has been empty for 15 min. I seriously almost cried when I bite in to one piece of octopus thing. The only edible thing I got was the mochi ice cream.   Maybe they have change of ownership, or maybe they are training new people. Anyways.... I don't think I have ever had such a horrible meal before in my life.",

Pros:   Kool little sushi place, atmophere is kool, alot of young people, good service staff, there rolls are good.....  The bad: They have no japanese staff (which may indicate lack of authentic sushi) There nigiri is cut in a weird unprofessional way, the fish is not always fresh, there wasibi is not always fresh, there ginger is not always fresh......freshness is a problem  If they fix the above this place could be a 4 or 5 star....  Fish freshness is a problem....  There miso sucks.....there rolls are good....  Kaya is still king, until I try Umiya.....but thats not saying much...I'm thinking of switiching back to just eating sushi vs AYCE...",

    "text": "Protip: remember that Sushimon on Sahara and Goyemon both use the same punch card! Make sure to get those stamps!  My go-to AYCE sushi place! Is it the best? Well, that's subjective. If you're looking for a solid AYCE for the quality and price, this is it. Disclaimer: Keep in mind that all-you-can-eat quality sushi cannot compare to the super fresh level of excellence of SOME, real, authentic sushi places. I wouldn't compare this Kabuto or other ala carte, higher-quality joints. This is strictly based in comparison to other AYCE places.  AMBIANCE: Decor is clean, intimate, but without the creepy silent vibes or weird football jerseys on the wall. Low mood lighting, laid-back, and doesn't feel too casual. You don't need to be too dressy either.  SEATING: Try getting a seat at the bar! Intimidated on how to order? Make eye contact with the sushi chef facing you even he looks busy, then say what you'd like!   Service is definitely hit-or-miss once in a while. This place is popular on the weekends especially during dinnertime. Last time I was here, it was still quite busy on a weekday dinner rush hour. Always expect a wait! A party of 5+ can be very difficult to seat! I believe they don't take reservations over the phone, but I heard this changed according to some other diners. If you're just dining with one other person, it's a lot quicker, especially if you say you don't care if you're seated at a table or the bar.  FOOD: I've been here countless times (enough to fill 5 of their stamps cards and a few paycheck's worth!), and the fish has always tasted fresh, crisp. Fish portion is generous. They don't try to load you up on rice unless you're ordering mostly rolls. Love the questionable super white tuna. The ubiquitous, americanized rolls are usually on-point, large, and presented beautifully. My fave is the moon roll!  Try ordering half-orders in case you end up disliking a particular roll. This way, you can sample many types of rolls. Too often do I see the people next to me saying they are not eating their rolls because they had too much of it or didn't prefer it. They end up not knowing you can order half! Ex: say \"half dragon\" or \"half\" whatever.  It varies on who your chef is when it comes to execution. A few times, my roll or nigiri has come out looking like a beauty school drop-out :C sometimes, consistency is an issue when it comes to presentation.  VERDICT: Although Goyemon is hyped up, it's really because they try to bring better quality fish to the masses of the AYCE crowd. Service can suffer when it's packed. Last time I was here, our server totally forgot about us sitting in the corner of the bar! When he saw my drink was completely empty, he tried to make it up to us by diligently coming back and checking on us since then.  Fun for a date-night spot or a small get-together. A solid experience and hands-down one of my favorite AYCE sushi spots.",

First of all you have to wait for an 40 minutes or more to be seated and the service is very slow.  Only thing I liked about this place is the hurricane roll (The extra star is for this roll). The fresh was not as fresh as some reviewers said.  OH and because we were sitting thing there and talking with friends with have not seen for awhile, mind you this is shortly after we paid the bill, they asked us if there was anything else we needed kinda their way of telling us to get the eff out because there were people waiting. I am sorry but if we were at any other place, they wouldnt make us feel that way.   They are never getting my business again. Get a bigger spot!",

Got 2 orders  Green tea ice cream - also got 2 orders alongside the lychee.  Perfectly bittersweet and creamy and balanced out the mild tart of the lychee.  So after all this, why only 3 stars?  Our server, though she frequently came by to check up on us, didn't smile even once.  How hard is it to smile?  Uses fewer muscles than to frown heh.  And secondly, we were confronted (at least nicely) at the end of our meal that we had overstayed the 45 min limit by half an hour.  No wonder the server kept saying last call.  I guess we should've read the fine print.  At least the hostess  smiled heh.  Anyone heard of a 45 time-limit on AYCE?",

I mean the service isn't really all that great, but it is also not that bad so i'll live. Definitely one of the better spots to grab sushi in vegas.",

    "text": "I've been going to Goyemon with my partner for over three years and I have to say that they are the best AYCE in Vegas when it comes to consistency and their nigiri/sashimi (I still think the best rolls go to Sakana).    As far as nigiri their best includes their Cajun albacore, Cajun tuna (special only), super white tuna, unagi, and garlic tuna.  Best grill items: pork belly, super white tuna and yellow tail.  Best rolls:  sexy girl, frying Jason, OID, caterpillar, pastel are the ones that come off the top of my head.  Oh and I really like their red bean ice cream for dessert.  Service is usually pretty prompt.  They have a few waitresses that I don't see too often anymore (I'm assuming for good reasons) that will let our food die in the window and take forever to take our next order.  Like I said, it doesn't seem to be much of an issue anymore.   On busy evenings expect a party of two to have a one hour wait.  There are no reservations allowed.  My advice - give them your number and grab a beer at PT's that is up the block.  You have ten minutes to get back to the restaurant and claim your spot once you receive a text.  Right next to Sakana...there isn't a better AYCE in town.",

    "text": "Came here with a group of friends when we came to Vegas for my birthday weekend :]  The ambiance is very trendy/hipster like with cute decor all around. The hostess told us there's a wait even though we saw a handful of empty tables that were calling our names to be seated. We had to ask the hostess a few time if she forgot about us, she replied by saying she didn't want to stack the server hence the hold in seating.   Our server was kind enough to inform us that sushi was a bit backed up so she encouraged us to order more kitchen items. We really enjoyed the large variety of items that Goyemon provided and there was no maximum of items each person can order at a time.   The quality of the fish was great, especially for an AYCE joint. One thing that you should remember, you can order HALF portions, which we should have done so we were able to try a larger variety of items [nigiris, rolls, tempura, kitchen, and dessert]. The only downside is, you cannot order Uni or Amaebi during lunch as part of the AYCE menu. Even for dinner, only 1 order allowed per person.   One highlight of the meal is BEWARE!!! of the 9-1-1 roll, my friend and I thought we could conquer this Spicy Tuna look-a-like roll, infused with habanero juice [which the chefs make themselves]. The server already gave us a fair warning that it's spicy and wow...it was no joke. I thought I could eat spicy but O-M-G...my face was on fire and my tongue lost all sense of its taste, I literally soaked my tongue in my Arnold Palmer for a good 5 minutes before it went back to 75% of its normality.  For the price [$21.95], you really get a bang for your buck. I think this will be to go spot for [AYCE] sushi whenever I am in Vegas.",

Ice cream: Which is also on the AYCE menu, I usually get green tea ice cream and tempura ice cream but I must've been in an adventurous mood because I decided to get the lychee ice cream, first off I wasn't too sure how this was going to taste. I love lychee but lychee in ice cream form idk. But I absolutely loved it, it was very tasty. Goyemons the only Sushi restaurant in Vegas that I know that serves Lychee ice cream.  The only reason it stays at a 4 for me is the wait time. The wait wouldn't be sooo bad if they had a bigger wait room, I noticed in the restaurant if they used their space smart they could've at least had 2 more tables put into their layout. The waiting area is kind of odd you kind of just stand on the wall as you watch people who are eating to be done.",

We got there around 8pm and there was about an hour wait as well but we just walked a few stores down, bought some beer and waited outside by our car until we got called in. We were then seated in their private room. We all got the all you can eat buffet for $27 but with tax it came out to little over $31.   Don't bother filling you tummy with the rolls because that makes you full instantly because we ordered about 2 and yes they were good but they were so filling. I loved all of the nigi sushi...sad that they only allow 2 pieces for the uni (sea urchin), amaebi (sweet shrimp) and the GREEN TEA CREME BRULEE (which is not on the menu). Their hamachi, ikura, ahi, salmon, unagi, scallops, albacore etc is all fine cuts and really freshly delicious! I also enjoyed their baked mussels, fried fish heads, asparagus, tomato salad. I think everything on their menu was great and I was so stuffed walking out...Now I know where to go for good buffet sushi whenever I visit Vegas.  The place is small and busy so be sure to wait and they do offer a punch card so for all you regulars out there.",

    "text": "BEST SUSHI EVER! PERIOD.   I lost count of how many times I ate here but every time I crave sushi, Goyemon is the only place to be. There's typically a 30 min wait if you come around peak dinner hours but it's well worth it.   Here's what I totally recommend to try from Nigiri Sushi   - Cajun Albacore - Snow Crab - Scallop - Yuzu Tobiko (if it's on special) - Ikura   I love their rolls too but I'm more of a nigiri sushi girl ;) However, all rolls that I ate there were exceptional! Make sure to try Puffy - Yum Yum!!!   My fave side dishes are Sashimi Salad, Pork Belly and Baked Greens Mussels.   The service is always great and if you sit by the bar you can get your sushi/rolls even faster!  Hands down - best sushi joint in town with consistent quality and freshness of food, friendly staff and great AYCE prices.",

    "text": "CONDENSED IN A SOUP CAN:  Goyemon is brother to a family of great restaurants including Monta Ramen/Chaya and Sushi Mon (now both the Maryland AND Sahara outlets are united under the same management)... so it safe to expect greatness.  It will not disappoint your taste buds and wallet, but it may test your patience for table wait.  THE MEAT:  Hubby and I have swung by this place a few times but we weren't willing to wait an hour or two for a table.  MAHALO to awesome Yelper friends with hookups to a private room!  The sake options are awesome, and for $8, you can have a 3-shot sampler of any sake on their menu.  Their appetizer, sushi/rolls and dessert offerings also give you a wide variety with no limits.  The must trys - pork belly (lots of melt in your mouth fat that works), salmon belly nigiri, salmon collar (they cook this beautifully - I believe it is a superior part of the fish), the ecstasy roll (albacore, tuna, seaweed, masago, yum yum sauce - all the flavors and textures were lip-smacking good), and yuzu or lychee sorbet.  We were underwhelmed by a few items like Cajun albacore (the fish and execution is exceptional in Sushi Koma, which also has a much better version of the scallop dynamite dish).  But on the whole, you get a great bang for your buck with quality ingredients, good service and varied quantity.  I've tried a lot of AYCE sushi in Vegas but Goyemon still remains the undefeated champion.    I'M STILL DIGESTING... the fact that I didn't order more salmon belly.  Darn it.

Upon arriving in the strip mall parking lot, the place is very unassuming, even dive-ish from the outside. The inside is actually quite nicely decorated in a simple yet well-appointed Japanese style.   Now on to the good stuff...  We ordered the All You Can Eat Lunch for $26.95/ pp. You really can't go wrong here. Order from the whole menu and the only restriction is the time limit of 45 minutes. Between the 2 of us we ordered 7 different rolls, soup, edamame, soft drinks and dessert - all included. I was stuffed when we left, to say the least!!   For the quality and selection of the sushi this is an amazing deal!!! Although everything we had was delicious, the stand outs were the Spider, Orion, and Tiger rolls.   When I'm in Las Vegas again in the future, this will be on my places to visit again.",

If you don't want to wait, you can go to a mediocre sushi place somewhere else. If you want good AYCE, come here but expect a slight wait for your food but it'll be worth it.",

I would definitely visit this place again.      We sat at the bar.  It was very busy on a Thursday night but there were two open seats, so no wait! Score!  At first, I was a little confused by the AYCE menu and no one explained it right away.  Eventually, one of the sushi chefs explained how it works.    Typically, I eat special rolls and very little nigiri, but not this night.  With the exception of a few things we chose to order, the chefs fed us their picks.  We had a ton of nigiri.  Everything was really fresh and tasty, particularly the mackeral.  The big eye tuna was really good too.  I tried everything Yelpers suggested.  This was my first time having Fried Pork Belly.  Holy crap!  Where have you been all my life?!  Unbelievably good.  A nice layer of charred fat and the mango salsa that accompanies it was the right amount of sweet.  Honestly, everything we tried was good, with one exception:  No matter how much you think you like spicy DO NOT ORDER THE 911 ROLL!  My mouth is still burning!  Thankfully, they offer $13 pitchers of Sapporo to help with the sting.",

It's a great local place and it doesn't have the WOW factor.. Just get your sushi on...! Great Date place, quiet enough to talk to your date and they are not pushy...! Try it a few times and u will see...! It's quaint...",

Service is generally forgetful and I've only eaten at the sushi bar (3 times) so can't speak on table service.  When I order sushi, obviously, it's easy, he's right in front of me and the things I order are timely from the sushi bar and depending on who is there I might get some friendly banter back and forth, but the kitchen food, hot dishes wise, is consistently lengthy waits, but it's not like it really ruins any experience.  You're going there to shovel food down your pipe like a caveman and you will and it will be delicious, but that might be the only flaw.  For $28 you won't get your socks blown off but, it's not top of the line quality but damn good enough and it's WAAAAAAAY worth the price.  Go and enjoy.  The money you'd spend on a la carte sushi....put it into sake...get drunk, eat a lot.  You win.",

    "text": "Sorry Elites...I was not as impressed as I thought I would be.  1.  We arrived to find out that there was a 45 minute wait to sit.  As we contemplated if we should go to our favorite sushi place that we both know that we will enjoy the fresh fish and not so over bearing rice on the nigiri's OR stay and try something new...so, we stayed.   2. The rice on the nigiri's were thick, hard as if it was pre-made and sat out on a buffet line .  So, I ate everything sashimi style as I magically made the thick rancid and hard rice disappear.... :-)   3. Fish quality wasn't bad. I really enjoyed that they have white fish on the menu and the scallop nigiri was amazing.   4. Pork belly! Normally, I am a pork belly fanatic. However, I feel indifferent.  The meat and fat was really good and had a sweet flavor.  I think the skin could have been crispy to have that WOW factor.   5. Crispy rice w/ spicy tuna was good.  I enjoyed the crispy texture and the spicy kick to the tuna.  6. Calamari was really good. This was one of my favorites.   7. I was disappointed that they ran out of hamachi kama....but wait...they are owned by Sushi Mon so they always run out of hamachi kama!   8. Overall...it was ok. I don't think I would frequent this place. It felt like it was more of a newer Sushi Mon with nicer restaurant materials.",

Their desserts are incredible and they don't limit you to just 1.  They are ALWAYS packed.

They also do half rolls which in my opinion is the best thing since sliced fish. We got the pork belly which is a must try unless you're on a strict diet. It's super fatty, melt in your mouth, all around amazing piece of marinated pork. They're known For it, so try it! Their nigiri is fresh. Fish to rice portion on point. Get the toro and the uni! Super white, garlic tuna, salmon, all fresh and yummy. The wait can get super long, it's worth it though! Reminds me a lot of sushimon almost identical in their rolls.

    "text": "All you can eat sushi. In Vegas. Revolutionary!   Or not.  Owned by the same people who own Monta and Sushi-Mon, this is another addition to their Japanese cuisine monopoly. As such, the resemblance to either restaurant is no surprise. In fact, just like Sushi-Mon they offer a small selection of special fish options for the day. When we arrived the only option they had available was their in-house smoked salmon, which was alright.   The highlights:  * Braised Pork belly. Pork belly is gelatinous, fatty and delicious by itself, but given the right TLC and it's a porky palate pleaser. This is no different, but it's best eaten in small doses. The portion size is meager so that takes care of that. Flavors and textures are great on this one.  * Raw scallop nigiri. Not the \"scallop dynamite\" smothered in mayo, this is real, tender scallop. It's delicious and rare to find in an AYCE place!  * Uni was fresh, not murky tasting.   Lowlights: * Baked green mussels. Blah! Bluefin's are better. * Orgasm Salad. I'd take a hundred screaming O's over this any day. Boo. Weird medley of assorted fish-chunks doused in a puddle of ginger-sesame dressing and a few wilted greens doesn't bring orgasm to mind at all- unless you mean that wet spot in the bed nobody wants to sleep on...  * Masago & Quail egg- I'd asked for Ikura but the chef assured me it was usually made with masago. Didn't float my boat OR sink my submarine.   The interior is nice, with lots of warm wooden tones throughout and low-hanging lamps.  The service could be spotty. There was confusion over who was actually taking our appetizer/drink orders and a lot of shouting back and forth from the sushi bar to the servers.   I'd rate this a 3 and a half star place. The food isn't awful and the service wasn't consistently bad, it just didn't blow me out of the water. I was tempted to go for a 4 star, but I figured rounding down will help counter the ebulliently high prior ratings.  I'm willing to give them another chance and try some of their specialty rolls, but it's a bit out of the way and didn't make me want to do a dance of belly-joy at the end of my meal.",

The two rolls that stood out to me were the Ecstasy roll and the Pixie Roll, the latter is from a super-special section of the menu from which you can only order one of the five options. That's it. One. AYCE with rules, of course. Always with the rules...  Two things I liked is that they offer half-rolls or whole rolls. And, when I asked for \"easy rice\" aka \"diet rice,\" they definitely accommodated.   Pass on the tempura ice cream. Very meh.  We had a 1:30 lunch, and there was no wait, so nice and low-key, with prompt and observant service. $22 for lunch AYCE.",

One of the great things about this sushi place is you most likely won't waste of food. Why? Because if you order something and don't eat it by the end of the meal, they will charge you for what you don't eat. This is smart business, and makes customers only order what they can eat.  We ordered, and we ate a lot between the four of us. We basically had everything on the menu. Tip: be careful when ordering. I believe I ordered four of one thing and I thought I would get four pieces, but each thing had three pieces so I ended up with twelve pieces of sushi.  Everything we ordered was made fresh for us, and I think they started taking their time getting us later orders because we may have been relatively eating too much. The sushi was more than fresh enough considering you're in the middle of a desert.  And when it came time for desserts, which is also included in the meal, we shared some mochi ice cream and matcha green tea ice cream.  In the end, all four of us were stuffed and there was not a single piece of rice left on our plates. Recommended.",

Sushi House Goyemon is a small sushi restaurant outside of the Vegas strip (but not too far). This is how it works, they have a la carte options but they also have their all you can eat option. If you like sushi, the all you can eat is a decent deal. It's about $27.00 for dinner and you can order as much sushi as you want. It's not just sushi. You can also order soup, salads, and even desserts are included on the menu. They do charge extra for leftovers so be mindful of what you order.   The sushi itself is delicious. It's fresh, made to order, and comes out in a decent pace. I would recommend keeping track of what you order, especially if you're in a large party. We were in a large party and our orders got mixed up. It was an accident and they apologized but definitely something to keep in mind.   Like I mentioned, Goyemon is small and there is a wait on weekends and holidays. So be prepared to wait. It's worth it, but definitely factor in wait time when you come to Goyamen. They also have a time limit of 1-2 hours if you decide to do the all you can eat option.   Factoring in everything, it's still a great deal and delicious food. If you like sushi and are in Vegas, definitely stop at Goyemon.",

    "text": "EDIT another visit on 7/30/2016 : Went to goyemon last night for another try .  I definitely regret my decision . As I got there I put our names down for a party of 6 . We're waiting for over 30 minutes when there is clearly tables available to be moved together . I seen 6 seats at the bar opened so I asked the seater lady if we could sit at the bar . She had to go ask the chefs if it was ok to sit at the bar ??? The chef said \"no because it will be too busy for them\"  .. Wtf ? That pissed me off . After that  a male server walks by 10 seconds after and says , \" if you sit at the bar, you better tip BIG .\" Wtf again ..don't tell me how I should tip. We go back outside to the hot and humid waiting area and wait for another 10 minutes .   Finally they call our group to sit at a table . We sit down. I can recall the server coming to our table to get our order about 3 times .. With 30 minutes in between each visit .. The great thing was , our original server had clocked out of work  Inbetween taking our orders , we seen her walk out of the door . Why on earth would you have your servers and sushi chefs clock out in the middle of serving someone ? We had to flag a different server down to help us out . Annoying .   The toro we ordered was not even tasty . Fish quality still went down since last time . They put my and 1 other group members all you can eat orders  on the same plate when they were sitting across the table from me . It was so annoying having to divvy out our sushi when they were sitting so far . Service sucks here . That was the final straw . LATA Goyemon .",

I literally could try everything I wanted without being scared of seeing the bill. I will say it's probably better to come here with a group of people who also choose the all you can eat option (so you can share) otherwise one or two orders of sushi rolls will fill you up quick.  I haven't eaten that much in a long time, I def think it's worth a try!",

Everything I've tried on the tempura side is amazing. The lemon, jala jala, red dragon, and ecstasy are a few faves. I've never tried anything I could not eat though like other places. There is nothing worse than being stuck with bad sushi for ayce.   Great service and food plus they have a stamp card you do for a free meal... Been enough to earn a free one, I'm on my second card.",

    "text": "It's passable, but overall, I'm not impressed. I got the sushi lunch combo instead of AYCE. Sadly, the meal that I got was just slightly better than buffet quality. The nigiri was TINY (less than the size of my pinky), and a few of the pieces of fish were slightly mangled. The CA roll was ok, but the avocado slice was paper thin.   Given that they do an AYCE, perhaps I shouldn't hold them to the same standards, but if I had to summarize the quality of my food in one word, I would choose \"cheap\". One last slightly snobbish criticism: the nigiri came out arranged in an improper order.....this didn't affect the quality, but it's not a good sign that the \"chef\" didn't know how to do it properly.",

It still is a little more than most places in LA but I'm not complaining.  What I Recommend - ALL THE DESSERTS! Seriously, we ordered 1 of everything. Sooo good! - Sashimi Salad - Supreme Salmon Roll - Tiger Roll - J.J. Roll - Salmon Sushi  I highly recommend the Lychee Sorbet!! It was refreshing and had lychee bits in it! They go a little heavy handed on the crab meat sometimes on the Sashimi Salad but it was really good overall! I love salmon so Supreme Salmon was my kind of roll! The J.J. Roll is heavy but soooo worth it.   TIP: No Uni or Ebi for lunch. You would have to pay the dinner price of $26.95 instead. This place is always crowded on the weekends so try going at an off time or make reservations!",

The hostess takes your phone number down and sends you a text that updates you when your table is ready. My party and I were able to wait outside until our table was ready. Although there are tables set outside of the restaurant, drinks can not be served while waiting which would have been nice! This place is quite busy and as told by the waitress my party was seated within the 50 minutes. This place is busy so if you are wanting to eat by a certain time I would plan accordingly. I assure you, it is well worth the wait.  My top favorites on the all you can eat menu are: 1.) The Hurricane Roll 2.) The Lemon Roll 3.) OID Roll 4.) Jala Jala (like for Jalapenos) 5.) Seaweed Salad 6.) Garlic Edamame  I also recommend that you try the sparkling blueberry sake!   This place was great and I plan on returning soon!",

I guess they don't have sufficient supply for lunch so most of the good stuff comes around dinner time . We ordered some tampura plate and the fried shrimp and veggies were so soggy and tasteless.   Service was bad. Waiters will stand around doing nothing instead of coming to you to order or offer you help. Had to wave in the air many times to finally get someone to attend us and it was not even busy at lunch .  Hands down. Another sushi fowl on this trip. Can't wait to go Raku sushi !

I went in thinking it wasn't going to stack up at all next to my beloved local sushi spot. I was pleasantly surprised at times and at other times I wanted to be teleported back to my sushi spot.    There were 6 of us who ordered the AYCE option. The stand outs were the super white  tuna sashimi and the garlic tuna sashimi.  The spicy tuna on crispy rice was good however our spot does it better and brings the heat with the addition of a jalapeno slice. Speaking of heat, the 911 roll was talked up to be incredibly spicy. It had some heat but I've had spicier and this was their only spicy roll which was a bit disappointing. The other rolls left me wanting more, more flavor, more combinations, and better presentation. They all tasted very plain to me.  Clicks heels three times ::: I want to go home, I want to go home, I want to go home.  The garlic edamame tasted like it was sauteed in olive oil and garlic, it too left something to be desired.   The options of deserts were a nice ending to the meal. I typically don't do desert at our local spot but it was part of the AYCE so why not. The chocolate mousse and green tea creme brulee were both good. However not outstanding.   For everything I ate spending only $30 before tip was a good deal. Sometimes you do have to spend more to get more.",

    "text": "One of the best sushi places in LV. This place is always super busy and after eating here I now know why.  Seating: Fortunately when I did eat here, I was seated right away. I went on a Sunday around 1pm; it was busy but luckily there was a table for two that had just opened. I foresee the wait time definitely being an issue in the future because even just 20 minutes into being seated there was a good 10 people waiting for a table. The place is smaller than most sushi restaurants I've gone to so that doesn't help.   Service: pretty good. I saw a lot of reviewers saying that the waiters aren't attentive but I had no issue at all with it. My water was refilled more than a couple times and the food was brought out in a timely manner (about 15-20 minutes for sushi and 5 for the soup and salad).  It was pretty busy at this time but I imagine that if it was even more busy, service wouldn't be as quick.   Food: my sister and I did not have the AYCE and believe me, it is STILL WORTH IT. The lunch specials are really a highlight of the menu; if you aren't hungry enough for AYCE or you don't feel like spending the $22 it's a great option. The rolls available on the lunch menu aren't the most intricate in flavors but for a basic roll it's a win. We had spicy tuna and shrimp tempura rolls; spice level was on par with other sushi bars I've been to and serving size was a little better than average. Lunch specials also include miso soup and salad! A total win for a complete lunch without breaking the bank.   Would absolutely return and plan on it in the very near future!",

    "text": "While I must contend that the sushi here is definitely better in quality (fish-to-rice & freshness) compared to other joints in town, the service here fails in comparison.   From what I know, the point in a timed AYCE restaurant is to get full before the time limit is over. We were given our food at a slow pace, which wasn't necessarily a bad thing as we were allowed time to digest the food and thus try more on the menu. Then we saw food on the specials menu and realized that it was also included in AYCE.  I am warning you from this point on that the dishes from that menu may or may not come at all. We wanted to try the items from the menu after our last round was over and thus ordered everything listed. We waited for over 30 minutes (can you believe it??) and the food still didn't come even after constant reminders to our waiter (he was new at the time but this is still a very costly mistake even for a newbie). It didn't take until our 4th reminder to the manager at the time for our food that she apologized to us saying that the chef at the time who creates the specials has left.   This is what I don't understand. If that certain chef at the moment is the one doing the specials, shouldn't all the chefs know of how to make it. On the other hand, if it is entirely a chef special dish only, then those items should be erased from the board IMMEDIATELY. We had our hopes up, waited an extremely long time, only to be disappointed. Because of such a long wait, all the food we originally ate all digested and we were hungry once again!!  The manager told us that we are free to order as much as we want and we will not be penalized for time. However, some people have places to go to and cannot sit down at a restaurant all day and wait for food to come at such a slow pace. This is definitely not an all-you-can eat experience where you will be left full and pleased, even with quality food. Quality service is just as important.",

The food now is not that great of quality either, the baked mussels are pretty chewy here and there's really nothing too special about this sushi restaurant but I mean if you want QUALITY go to umiya sushi they close at 2 am AND they're not busy all the damn time and the service at umiya is really nice and they're somewhat fast",

The rolls are all pretty good and my favorite is probably the super white tuna nigiri (pictured below) I could eat that all day.   The only down side I can give it is the size of the restaurant. It is small and more than once I have had 45 mintue wait times. I've never actually waited 45 mins though, maybe closer to about 25-30 minutes and they get you in.  I usually attend with a party of 3-4 people. I imagine if you had a large party you should call in advance and set something up instead of just showing up and having to wait.   Customer service is solid for how busy it is. Another good thing is it is open until I believe 2am or 3am with last seating about an hour before close. We always have a good time hanging out at this place. Obvioulsy we also always make sure to get our moneys worth!",

    "text": "Personally, whenever I go to sushi houses, I never eat anything but the AYCE. I feel like the value of the price relative to how much you can eat will surpass the value of the sushi itself, but that is dependent on the person. They have a normal lunch menu as well as AYCE during lunch, but I'm not so sure about dinner.   On my various visits, I've been satisfied with the service. My first two times I came to Goyemon when I ordered, I ordered a lot the first time and the server gave me this warning of a sort that if I don't finish the food, I have to pay extra. Personally, I don't like people telling me stuff like that just because I know I wouldn't order more than I could eat, but I understand a lot of people don't finish their food and they just want to be pre-cautious.The servers are busy usually, but I also feel like they try not to make eye contact with you or something so you don't order more or something, for obvious reasons. So when you need something, you have to raise your hand and speak up.  The food I would say is quite good. I am very satisfied with the quality of the rice and fish they serve. I personally love rolls, and so I am really satisfied with the rolls that they serve. I only wish they had a wider selection. Their nigiri is delicious as well. My favorite is the super white tuna and I recommend that to anyone who is new to eating sushi.",

If anything, the wait time is a testament to the quality and value of this place!    This ain't yo' regular AYCE sushi joint. Everything here was top notch -- fresh and flavorful. Save yourself the trouble from ordering the rolls (unless of course, that's your thing), go to town on the nigiri and grilled items. The blue and white menu,   though not a secret, is a hidden gem!    Hubby and I have talked about coming back to Vegas just to eat at this place. Seriously! Fredo, one of the sushi chefs, is super friendly too and will recommend the especially tasty items on the menu. We weren't lucky enough to get him, but heard him making recommendations to the diners next to us all night.  A for sure spot the next time we are in Sin City!",

They are always packed, so you might have to wait a little to be seated. I see people giving bad reviews for having to wait but I never see this as a downside at any good establishment. I would rather wait a few minutes at a place that is so good people line up for it then get stuck sitting right away at a place that can't keep it's tables full. I am sorry if you can not handle a wait, but this place is sooo worth it.   Be warned if you go for the 911 roll...it...is....spiiiicy....I LOVE spicy rolls, and although it was super tasty this one knocked me back a bit hehe.   I LOVE the nigiri so much. Perfect little bites, not overstuffed with rice at all. The staff always seems happy to be there, even when super busy, which is another huge plus for me.  I do not normally fill up on too many appetizers but their miso soup is sooo tasty, not too salty!! and their fried dumplings have an awesome crunch without being overly fried.",

We came here on a Saturday night, and it was really busy.  There was a 45 minute wait, but this is one of the few places where their seating estimate was actually fairly accurate.  Luckily, one of our group lived nearby, so we just went and chilled at her apartment for a while.    We sat in the little room to the side for groups, which is usually a death sentence for good service, especially when your group isn't huge (we were a group of 5).  However, the waitress was really good about coming out to check on us often, and refill our waters, etc.  They have a lunch and dinner AYCE deal, for $21.95 & $26.95.  There are about 50 menu options for each item, ranging from  nigiri, normal rolls, and special baked rolls.  It's really nice because anything on the regular menu you can get in the AYCE option (including the $12-13 specialty rolls).  When they bring out your orders, they bring out half an order instead of a full order, so that you can try more options.  Not having prepared my stomach for AYCE, I ordered the Sashimi dinner, which is 12 pieces of sashimi w/ soup & salad.  Another in our group got the SS dinner, and the chicken katsu curry.  All were delicious!  The portions are generous, and all of the fish is really fresh.    I had a really great experience at this restaurant, and I can't wait to go back and have the AYCE next time!",

For $25 a pop, you are granted unlimited amounts of sushi including their specials of the day.  in other words, AYCE!  I won't hit every single item I consumed but some of the key ones that I enjoyed personally were:  + Salmon Belly: If this is listed on their Special of the Day menu, do not hesitate to order this! Smooth and Yummy!  + Tempura Shrimp: I know what you're saying, how can this be good? The tempura was light and crispy.  Shrimp tasted as if it was just taken out of the water and cooked to perfection.  + Tempura Ice Cream: pretty good, light tempura shell and soft ice cream.  Do not feel overwhelmed as you can spend a couple of hours digging into every single Nigiri item.  Their AYCE also included Appetizers (all), Dessert, and Special Rolls.    I recommend sitting at the counter so you can socialize with their Sushi Chef who will charm and enlighten you with his culinary life and knowledge of the sushi world.  Plus, you can place your order on the fly.    A QUICK TIP: Ramen served in the Evening.  I would most definitely make a return when I'm back in good ole' (third home) Vega$.",

SO first we arrive and wrote our names down and waitress told us it will be around 1 wait but they will give us a call 10 mins before the table is ready. SO they called us and we told them we will be arriving the restaurant within 5 mins and waitress says OK...NO PROBLEM and we got there and told the waitress we had arrived....AND she confused us with someone else and say that \"OH I ALREADY GAVE YOUR TABLE AWAY BECAUSE YOU DID NOT PICK UP YOUR PHONE, SORRY YOU HAVE TO WAIT AGAIN\" SO we were all kind of mad...with the attitude that was given to us. We showed her our phone call log, that we were on the phone with them for 1min 16 seconds. then the waitress did not apologize, she jsut went \"OH, COME OVER HERE\" and sit us down.   Just as we thought we can finally eat!!!!!!!!! I ordered the yellow masago (not sure what the real name is) I ate the sushi...then I felt something really pointy/sharp was in my mouth and it kinda cut my gums in my mouth. I spit it out and realized it was some hard broken plastics. I showed the waiter and he immediately took our dishes with no explanations or whatever and not even apologie. After 10 minutes he came back and wanted to offer us a new order so I was like HELL NO...and he explained that the people in the kitchen accidently broke a plastic container and he apolgoized.   It keeps me wonder whether the it was the container that contains the yellow masago broke or was it another container that broke becasue it does make a differences, if it was the container that contains the yellow masago that broke I could be eating un-clean food. :(  I Guess i wont come back again.",

The rolls are delicious, and the option to order half-rolls is VERY helpful is you want to try a vast variety of rolls. The servers are usually attentive; however, they can seem a bit surprised if you can eat sushi like you're a human vacuum.  I also enjoyed the side dishes. My favorite is probably the pork belly. The dessert is also unlimited (surprise, surprise), and you cannot go wrong with Mochi Ice Cream or the Lychee.  However, keep in mind that this restaurant does not take reservations. If you are with a large group, you may have a long wait ahead of you, even on a weekday. If you'd like to make a reservation for AYCE, I recommend Island Sushi in Henderson.",

TORO, Salmon Belly, Wasabi Octopus, and SNOW Crab Nigiri. THUMBS UP!!!!. Pork Belly appetizer lives up to the hype and then some.  Rolls were the same as anywhere else. Also the deserts. SAVE ROOM FOR THE DESERTS. Lychee Sorbet, and Green Tea Burlee OMG Service was great. I knocked down a star for wait, the sweet shrimp being only okay.

I will make some suggestions and give some advise when you visit here:  * If you don't want to wait at least an hour you should during their off hours (i.e. lunch or dinner times).  This place isn't very big, just be warned. * They are open late with the last seating at 2AM (yes that's 2 in the morning) * If you have a small group or even just want to try something new, don't be afraid to order half rolls (if you like that type of sushi) * Most of the sushi is all you can eat with the exception of the uni (sea urchin) and the sweet shrimp * Small groups (3 or less) opt for the sushi bar because it maybe first available (i.e. you get seated faster and you get your sushi faster) * Look at the chalkboard near the sushi bar, this has specials and in-season items not found on the menu  I tried so many of the rolls I don't remember which ones I had, but I remembered I liked them all.  My mom loves the white tuna here.  You wouldn't expect fish to taste so fresh in Vegas but it does!  You must get the green tea creme brulee!  I will be back soon!  I hope I don't forget my stamp card!",

Immediately upon being say ordered 10 salmon belly for the table and a few rolls and apps. After a few minutes the rolls came out but not the salmon belly. I asked again, they said it was still being made. After we ate the rolls and apps, still no salmon belly. I asked again for the salmon belly and was told they were now all of a sudden out.  I told them that was unacceptable and didn't want to order anymore. I also told them I wasn't going to pay the full AYCE price for the lunch because I didn't get what I ordered. I offered to pay for the rolls we ate but the manager told me no, I had to pay full price. I told her that wasn't going to happen. Either accept that I would pay for the small amount we ate or not. She said no, full price, no discount. I told her I would walk out and she could call the police if she wanted to and she said I couldn't leave. I told her I was leaving. My son and I got up to go and she GRABBED MY 9 YEAR OLD SON BY THE ARM. I immediately told her if she touched my son again I would knock her out. As we left, she called the police and tried to block my car in. Other patrons came out to help her but when I explained what happened to them, she let us leave.  Be VERY careful what you order. It might end up with the manager physically detaining your children.",

For $27, I've had arguably the best sushi I've ever had and it was AYCE!  The venue is pretty small and space fills up really quickly so I recommend getting here pretty early. They do have a 1 hour eating maximum but like I said, if you're devouring sushi like us, 1 hour is plenty or else this place will run out of fish.   The menu has all kinds of nigri, salmon, tuna, yellow tail, they also have rolls but we didn't really touch those. Additionally, they have seared sushi as well such as the cajun salmon. Furthermore, the pork belly just melts in your mouth. Moreover, the appetizers like miso soup, garlic edamame, and sea weed salad are great side dishes to much on while you're waiting for your orders to come.   The dessert here is amazing! I rarely, order 2nd servings of desserts but this place made me order 3rd helpings! This place has arguably the best green tea ice cream I've ever had. It was rich, smooth, and did not have that cheap flour taste that other places have. Furthermore, the Yozu sorbet was delicious. I think it was the greatest ice cream dessert I've ever had and I crave for it all the time!  I honestly, felt bad for our waitress as my group became a hungry pack of piranhas. Have you ever seen a pack of Piranhas devour a fish? I would love to add a youtube video here but I rather not give people an upset stomach...  My group has been to most of the popular sushi places in Vegas, Yama, and Koma, and Goyemon is heads above the crowd.   Hands down the best AYCE sushi. Once you come to this place, no other ayce sushi place can ever compare.  Extra Note: According to my friend, this place is so amazing that he beat 3 levels of candy crush within the hour... XD",

    "text": "OK, it's a 5 star review, but was almost 4 stars.  Came here on a Saturday night, and it was of course busy, but there were two tables of 2 open that I could have been seated in way sooner.  The staff were trying to wait for the table between them to get up so they could seat a party of 6, even though there was another table for them opening up shortly, so my party could have been eating sushi sooner.  But whatever, I won't hold that against them.  The AYCE sushi was awesome, as all the other reviewers already covered.  The toro was just out of this world, and so was the sweet shrimp.  Everything else was pretty well above average, except for the salmon, which was nice and big but just wasn't as delicious as a few other spots I've been to around town.   Oh yes, the hamachi was great as well.  Kept ordering \"one more order\" at the end of the meal.  Had a couple 1/2 rolls that were ok.  I'd much rather eat nigiri.  Also tried a few of the unusual (for AYCE at least) items like the crispy rice with spicy tuna and the grilled pork belly.  Again, everything was delicious.  Also was offered a punch card when I paid, which I wasn't sure if they'd have or not.  Kind of rubbing it in my face, because I had a fully stamped card from Sushi Hana, the place that used to be in the space Goyemon is in, and then they shut down.  OK, let's try this again.  8 meals to go!",

    "text": "Probably some of the best all you can eat sushi in Vegas. However, note that the wait is usually quite long, especially for large parties. If you do have a large party, you'll likely be seated in the private room on the side. This sometimes causes service to be rather slow due to difficulties getting a servers attention from this area. Also, if you do have a large party, I would recommend not ordering too much food at a time, as it can cause some delays in getting the food. Maybe even ordering some appetizers when you first get seated would be a good idea.  Aside from their main menu, they have some menu items on their paper place mats that you may miss out on if you're not careful. One the side menu, I would definitely recommend would be the Pork Belly (only on the dinner menu though). It is amazing. That is all. As far as nigiri and rolls, just pick what you think you'd like.   Definitely don't forget to leave a little room for dessert! I would recommending trying the lychee sorbet (which is amazing), mochi, green tea ice cream, and green tea creme brulee.  Come famished, leave full and almost unable to move.",

    "text": "Okay I am currently sitting here at Goyemon and what happened...? Goyemon used to be my favorite AYCE sushi restaurant but not anymore. Quality of sushi is consistent but their service is not good. Not good at all. I ordered a spicy tuna roll extra spicy and boy it was wayy too spicy. They have a roll called 911 which is beyond spicy and thats what they made me. I wanted a spicy tuna roll with a spicy kick not a ghost pepper spicy roll that I feel like im gonna die after one bite... Anyway I sent the roll back and I can overhear from sushi bar something about they wanted extra spicy and this is extra spicy why are they complaining blah blah blahjhhhhhh  Also, all of the sushi was coming out so slowwwwww.... When its not even busy at all. There are only like three tables as you can see in the picture... I mean are they making sushi with their feet... Cmon... Then we tell the manager that it is way too slow and she tells us that shes trying to tell them but they are not listening or something. What kind of management is that?  Overall experience is bad.",

Another server, Sanae, noticed us just sitting with an empty table and checked up on us with a smile. She fulfilled our last few orders and I wished she was our original server.",

Parking - Very easy, not so crowded strip mall off Decatur between Hacienda and Trop on the west side.  2.  Ambiance - Very nice, good sushi that seem to easily seat about 15 or so.  About 9-11 tables, I really did not count.  Party room that is real comfy for about 12 people, yeah, the same 12 that can fit all in one elevator. If you are not one of them, be careful and suck it in!  I like the place and ambiance.  3.  Reservations - Only for large parties. If you go during dinner, you will probably wait. We went on a Wednesday at 7:30 for a party of 6 and it was about a 50 minute wait.  4.  Service - Pretty darn good, attitude a 5+ and knowledge was same.  If they would explain why some peeps that seemed to just show up and get seated right away , then it would go from pretty darn good to freakin amazing!  5.  Food - I am a traditionalist, so they had my favorites that were tasty like Ikura, Uni, Amai-ebi, fried ebi heads, Ikura,  They had all the wild complex rolls that many like to order now and while I don't recall all the names, they were all so very good.  They even made one that my fellow muncher specified and it turned out really great!  The people here are great, the food great, the ambiance great. You cannot go wrong.  This place is also the same as Sushi-mon owners, so be sure to have your dining card or keep the receipts for that free meal.....  Go for it!  Arigato.",

I love how they have a big selection of traditional japanese rolls and nigiri, i honestly cant stand big fried rolls with slaps of sauce and fish! They have natto roll and sweet gourd roll! My fav, almost 99% of the so called \"sushi\" restaurants done have that! I was in heaven!  i cant wait to come back to vegas and have more!  o and get a stamp card, so worth it because after 10 all you can eat dinners, 11th is free yay!",

    "text": "4.8 stars on the days when the best chefs work.  I come to this place often since i honestly think other places can't beat ayce sushi like this. However, today was an exception, and it hurts to give this place a 1 star.  11/19/15 Around 2pm We order shrimp tempura and supreme salmon without fail every time we come. The tempura is usually always really crispy, but today it was kind of mushy, and it fell apart as i dipped it into the sauce. It was still ok though. The rice today was just DEPRESSING. Usually the pieces are easy to pick up and there is no strong rice vinegar taste. The rice on both the supreme salmon and dragon roll tasted so strongly of rice vinegar that it reminded me of some cheap sushi place and literally made me lose my appetite. The pieces stuck together and stuck to the plate. Not to mention that the rice was mushy and cold. It felt like i was eating sour and sweet chewy clay.  I hope this doesnt offend anyone who works there, but i do wish for someone to take this seriously and fix the rice.   Update 01/24 Someone fucked up the rice AGAIN. How can i eat this when there is too much rice and whatever they mix in there. Seriously, if the rice is fucked up just make it over again and provide the quality service you NEED TO PROVIDE. This isn't worth the money when all i taste is rice vinegar. It ruins everything and turns everything sour. Almost every piece of sushi was shit.  Sorry, not sorry.",

But there in lies, my dilemma.  Coming here, I was under the impression that it was in fact, a buffet.  I was wrong.  What I experienced was an all-you-can-eat-a la carte place.  So, basically you order and they make your sushi to order. Because of this, the quality of the fish, and rice is higher than any other all-you-can-eat sushi joints I've been to (though, I tend to avoid these at all costs).  But, due to the fact that it's all-you-can-eat their product is just not up to par with sit down joints (also, I have been very spoiled in my raw fish experiences)  I think I'm going to rate them on being an al a carte place, and give them 3 stars... It was good, but not special.  That's not to take anything away from them, as, previously state - probably the best all-you-can-eat sushi I've had...",

They have items on the menu that you can enjoy and still be reasonable while dieting, ie. non-fried/greasy sushi rolls.  My favorite roll is probably the Ecstasy Roll.  If I had to go with a not so healthy roll, I'd go with the Hurricane Roll (shrimp tempura on the inside).  On a lucky day, the daily specials may include Toro, Blue Fin Tuna and Salmon Belly.   One of the things that stands out about Goyemon & Sushi Mon, is that their dessert menu is also AYCE.  The only other place that did this was Yama Sushi, but no more.  For that reason, you can't go wrong with Goyemon.  On a busy night, you may find yourself waiting 2 hours.  If it's not too busy, the wait may be 15 minutes.  Either way, bring your appetite!",

Once the waiter came over we also gave our food order because we didnt want to wait another 15min and that was the 1 and only time we saw our waiter I had to ask the hostess for the bill.

Let's just say we ended up leaving before we could even order food, my 3 year old daughter was so upset and hungry.   When being seated I right away told the waitress it was our first time dining there and she completely ignored my comment and took our drink order; note we didn't even have menus yet, so how am I to know what their drink options are.   There is no sharing with a 3 year old if your doing AYCE. We asked about my friends daughter who is only 5 and she said she would cost $26.95 same as an adult. That is outrageous. Yes we could have ordered ala carte but the server did not even suggest that she just said no there's no sharing and that yep she would be regular price and basically walked away and didn't come back. I was going to pay for the two lemonades she brought us that were basically all ice, but again she never returned and I tried asking the hostess for Togo cups and I would pay for the drinks and she said \"oh uh yea we don't have Togo cups\" and walked away also. Again note, there were to go lids on the kids cups. So you have lids but no cups? And didn't even bring us straws with our kids drinks. No harm there but it was just too much so we obviously left.   There are too many other AYCE sushi places to give this place another chance.",

We added both salads,  The Orgasm salad, seared tuna on top of mixed green and shredded diakon with  a spicy sauce, and the Hashimi salad, tuna, salmon, albacore, and crab meat layered on spring mix and shredded daikon with a dressing.  I enjoyed them both, my husband didn't.  We ordered several times and items did make it to the table but rather slowly.  Each roll was fresh and we enjoyed them, but the slow service makes us frustrated when we come here, if we order ten items, it takes forever to get them, And if we are looking to order again, it takes forever for someone to stop by to take the order.",

If so, no need to ask anymore, because this is it!! THE BEST ALL YOU CAN EAT SUSHI JOINT IN TOWN! WITHOUT A DOUBT!  WHAT: Firstly, we got to test out the new party room! There were 20 of us sushi-eaters ready to devour and take advantage of that AYCE sushi menu! The servers were all dolls! They were extremely helpful (knowing how hectic a large party can be) and us paying separately did not scare them at all. They were well-prepared! COOL points for the staff that night!  So, on to the food! I would just like to state the fact that each dish was made with such perfection! From the many attractive flavors, to the presentation!  SOME THINGS I TRIED:  Orgasm salad: Something a little bit different! The sauce blend had a little tang and zest to it, which actually made the salad.  Pastel roll: shrimp and crab wrapped inside soy paper, shrimp and avocado on top, slightly drizzled with spicy yum & eel sauce on top!  911 roll: To all of you spice-aholics, you need to try this one! I personally thought that I would be able to take some HEAT, but I had to LEAVE THE KITCHEN for this one! After several drinks of water and patiently waiting it out, the spice stuck to my tongue! So, the tip for this roll: BEWARE, AND PROCEED WITH CAUTION! haha  I LOVE BAKED ROLLS! So, I love the fact that they have a handful of great ones! O.I.D. roll: shrimp & asparagus wrapped in salmon & baked with yumyum sauce! Oh whatt?!! Baked 428: I had to try this one just because it said baked chicken inside the roll! I have never tried a chicken roll =) Goyemon lasagna roll: I love japanese lasagna rolls, so I always try it in every sushi spot. & this won my heart over! My absolute favorite lasagna roll of all time!  DESSERT! Oh how I love the end of beautiful beginnings solely due to dessert! So... there are a couple of desserts you may choose from on the ayce menu, (tempura, mochi, etc) meaning you can get as much as you'd like?! There is a separate dessert menu you can choose from as well, where you are only allowed to pick one on there! And on this beautiful menu lay \"GREEN TEA CREME BRULEE,\" which happened to be my pick! =D It was completely marvelous!  Lastly, I would like to give a shoutout to my fellow yelper, Nelson Q., for introducing me to such greatness! You got me hooked, my friend! So hooked that I will be back there next week!  WINNER, WINNER, SUSHI DINNER!",

    "text": "My last update for this place was 2 years ago so let me get more specific with the rolls! This is STILL my favorite sushi place in Vegas. Hell, I went to San Diego and still found this place better than all the places we tried out there! Their All You Can Eat is $26.95 for dinner and $24 before 4! They do have reservations there as well. They have stamp cards too. Okay now lets talk about the food. Their Dynamite appetizer is really good! I recommend it to start off with if you like scallop. The Gyoza is the same one you'll find at Monta (same owner) so it's the best gyoza in Vegas. Their Lasagna roll is the best roll to me. So creamy and delicious. It's heavy though so if you're getting full, just don't. The 9-1-1 roll is so hot I literally got light headed and dizzy for 20 minutes. It was that spicy. Hurricane roll is really good too. Get the Dragon for sure though. That's my favorite standard roll there!",

    "text": "Yay for first reviews! I always criticize food places and I've eaten a good amount of sushi. Having gone here tonight with my boyfriend's family (and still bloated from dinner), I thought this place deserved my first yelp review. Here it goes:  Restaurant and Ambience: I have been to Goyemon more than 6 times for AYCE. Each time, the restaurant is fairly busy and full. For a party of six, I had to wait about 45 minutes for a table. Bathrooms were always clean and the sword on display above the toilet is pretty cool. The menu is similar to that of SushiMon on Maryland because they have the same owner. AYCE is everything on the menu, the specials on the chalkboard, as well as the ones on the placemat. What I love about this sushi place is that you are able to do half orders of special rolls which gives you more opportunity to try different rolls without pressure of over ordering.  Sushi: My favorite special rolls are the Lemon roll, Pastel roll, and Crunchy Rice roll. Each one has a distinctive flavor characteristic to the roll, which is nice because I've been to some sushi places (great sushi) but the rolls feel heavy and complicated. In these, you taste the fish and the ingredients compliment each other. For dinner, I also order the grilled cajun salmon and pork belly. Did I mention that dessert is AYCE too? Not only mochi, but red bean or lychee sorbet, fried tempura ice cream, and specials like the chocolate mousse. They have hot green tea but it tasted more like hot barley tea, which I didn't mind because I love barley. Service was friendly and prompt tonight. Food came out reasonably fast for bulk ordering. There were some slow points.  Overall: I keep coming back to this place with occasional visits to try out other sushi restaurants. The nigiri fish are a bit smaller for my liking and tonight, it wasn't as moist as the last time I had tried them. I don't find their appetizers \"craving\" worthy although they are decent. The grilled salmon are also ordered by piece and their about the size of your thumb. It 's not comparable to the grilled slab you get from Yama sushi. I guess I just have a problem with portions, but I overall like the place enough to be a regular.  IF you want to become a regular, ASK FOR A STAMP CARD! It works for Sushi Mon too and the 11th AYCE is free. Yay free sushi!",

I've tried many other Sushi spots throughout Las Vegas and I'm a critic at all the others because no other can compare.  You would be silly not to get the AYCE, its soooo worth it.  I prefer to sit at the Sushi Bar because we come here so often that I don't really ever have to put in an order, they just keep serving us.    Monta Ramen after 11pm, Pork Belly melts in your mouth, if you like Hamachi Kama, it is sooo tasty (if they don't over cook it).  Don't forget to try their Green Tea Creme Brulee and if they have it, their Green Tea Cake too!",

When we finally got seated at the bar the sushi chef wasn't very friendly. He was fast though. Nothing off the menu really impressed me at all. I ordered ikura and it was bad meaning it was spoiled. We had a collection of plates that our server never picked up. Nothing was extraordinary. That goes both ways. Nothing was extraordinarily bad and nothing was extraordinarily good either. I just expected more from all the high praise this place received on Yelp.",

    "text": "Unfortunately, the removal of 4 stars is due to the service here. We've have been going to Sushimon for about 3 years now and sine they opened Goyemon we've started going there as it is closer. This fish is good-we never have a problem with that. We enjoy the rolls, apps and deserts.   But the service is so horrendous I'm afraid we wont be going back. There is always a long wait (reservations are only allowed for LARGE parties), the hostess always messes up( shes given our spot away at least 3 times in the year and a half we've been going the Goyemon), the wait staff is just all over the place and often ignores you.  They have had a problem with the service pretty much since they opened, but we keep trying to give them a chance. The wait times of 1-2 hours is ridiculous and often it will cause us to leave.   We've eaten here many many times and often bring friends who visit from out of town. My bf drives a taxi and has brought tourists to Goyemon many, many times when asked about the best sushi in town.    What really was the nail in the coffin for us was last nights dinner. It began as usual, bad hostess, 45min wait, more bad service, but the food was good. Then, we tried to use our stamp card which was for a free AYCE that was expired by mere days and were refused. The point of the stamp card is that you get 9 AYCE stamps in one year and you get one free, obviously you need to obtain these in a year so its worth while for the restaurant. All of our stamps were from the same year, it just \"expired\" and they wouldn't honor it. We actually have multiple stamp cards from here and this one happened to get missed the last time we ate here. Being that we have been here so many times, even before they were busy, and were denied with such an attitude told us to never return.",

We go about once every week or two and am never dissapointed.  I love that they are open all day and super late so I can go whenever I have a craving, day or night. The supervisor is also super cool.  He always greets us with a welcome back and practically has our orders memorized.  I also love that they post the specials on FB everyday too! When we're actually there and the chalkboard is too far or is blocked we can just pull up the specials on FB. GENIUS!   fresh fish, awesome staff, great menu/selection, must try.  I have a hard time going anywhere else these days!",

    "text": "This review would be 2.5 stars, but I am rounding up as a courtesy.  I was not impressed. Lackluster would be the word I would use. I've read the reviews. I saw the pictures. That's what brought me here. The hubby is not a sushi person so to get him to go to sushi joint is like pulling teeth. Well now it just got harder.  We went around 2:30 on a Saturday afternoon. there was a wait for a table, but we took seats at the bar. The service was lacking, to say the least. Our hostess looked like she was pissed off at the world --the place got off to a bad start from the get-go.  I ordered AYCE and the hubby had a spicy chicken bowl. The miso soup had 1 piece of seaweed in it (1 total - I didn't get any).. and it was oily and bland. The shrimp tempura I ordered was lukewarm and greasy. My husband was not a fan of spicy chicken - he said it was not spicy at all and was not very hot - temperature-wise. I ordered 6 pieces of salmon sushi and 2 hamachi - that was good but nothing that stood out. Someone mentioned this in an earlier review - the rice was quite warm for sushi. I typically do not mind it but a few pieces were actually hot and it altered the taste. I also had the tiger roll and the rock and roll - all were A-Ok.  No one took my empty plates...and they were really piling up. When we were ready for dessert it took a full 10 minutes for someone to even acknowledge us. I get that it was crowded but I couldn't get anyone to look at me. The guy next us actually had to get up and physically go to the host stand to get his check.  I'm bummed we had the experience that we did, especially when I've heard such great things but we were not impressed. They're are sushi places that are closer and friendlier.   The food was okay but overall - we were disappointed.",

The dining room was packed, but the wait was still unacceptable for that long of a time.  With the food, the nigiri were pretty fresh and the special rolls were good. I'm not sure if it is worth the price though simply because there is that huge wait before getting any food. Also, you have to order a lot of food at one time or the dishes will come staggered at random times. You may be full before using the all you can eat option to the fullest.  Another gripe is that there is a requirement to finish all the food that comes out or face a penalty. The amount of rice can be overwhelming and for the price, customers should have the option just to have sashimi if they want.  Last negative comment (I promise), the dessert menu is pretty lacking in options and the portions are small so order a lot of those suckers.",

No one was paying attention to us anymore we tried to order more because we we were not done eating yet but no one was really paying attention to us. It took them another 20 min just to bring out Green tea ice cream. Which in reality how long does it really take to get the green tea ice cream  unless they actually make it themselves. But the other deserts came out in less than a min. They are normally pretty good but this time I was a little embarrassed because we brought our friends telling them that it was a pretty good place. :(",

The good things about here is there sushi is always fresh, fairly good selection of different sushi rolls, and there pretty quick at getting the rolls out even as busy as they are.   The down fall, seems to be the same down fall at any of the good sushi places.  There restaurants are always packed and there's usually a 20+ min. wait no matter what time you go there.    In my opinion there worth the wait over going to a place you can get right in and the sushi is mediocre.  So as long as your not in a rush, def. worth a visit!",

This place blasted those expectations out of my ass.  The fish is incredibly fresh and well cut. The fatty pieces are handled expertly and melt in your mouth. Pieces like fresh scallop (hotate) which are mishandled most places are fantastic here.  There are a couple of pieces limited to one order per person which are really quite nice. The uni is great which is a rare find for an AYCE place.  It's pretty awesome that desserts and hot food are included as well.We got one of each dessert and split them all. The green tea ice cream was particularly tasty.  If you love great sushi, if you're a person who goes omakase at the sushi bar, then this might be the first AYCE place that impresses you.",

It was a Thursday night at 8pm and it was packed!  The hostess told us 25 minutes, and not more than 20 minutes later, we were seated and ready to order.    Unlike many other AYCE, you are not constantly hounded by the waitress to place an order.  In fact, they are very courteous and check on you just enough so that you are always able to order but not rushed in any way.    I can't remember specifically what we ordered, but it was a lot of nigiri and rolls and everything was simply amazing.  The pork belly appetizer was also very very good.  My only complaint is that it was a tiny serving so we had to keep ordering more.  You can order the rolls in half orders so that you can try more stuff off the menu.  The ONLY thing I did not particularly like was the calamari tempura.  It was like rubbery fish sticks in tempura batter. YUCK.  Everyone is right that the nigiri rice portions are very reasonably small, unlike a lot of other AYCE places.  This has become one of my favorite sushi places and I can't wait to go back!!",

I hate to sound snobbish because far from that when it comes to food, but I know my sushi and this review will reflect the entire experience I shared with friends of mine.  I heard about this place from a few friends already and I wanted to give it a go because like I said, I am the AYCE Sushi King! I had to try it to measure it up to my favorite in the Valley. After a marathon, i left the decision of food to a good friend of mine, and I had great expectations because I believe in her taste. Now, mind you, it would all be our first time, but I was down! There's such a thing called hungry eyes and I don't mean Patrick Swayze in Dirty Dancing and my eyes were not satisfied let alone my royal palette ;) I start off by warming up my stomach with my usual orders of nigiri (fresh water eel, salmon, and Cajun albacore), seaweed salad, and green mussels! The preliminary order had satisfactory flavor, but I did notice that they put very little rice! I liked that part! I noticed that the friends I was with was not very happy with their service and that took a toll on my experience.   I believe a restaurant MUST understand how to treat and serve their patrons well FIRST and then deliver with high quality food or products! However, service seemed to be at the bottom of their priorities; at least for us it was.  If my friends aren't happy, I'm not happy. And when I'm not happy, you get 2 stars! 1 for being open during lunch and 2 for having an AYCE sushi during lunch for $21.95. The sushi was subpar, the appetizers were decent but not wow, and the atmosphere was not as welcoming or friendly as others in the Valley. They do have a cool sword in the men's restroom though! :) I will probably end up coming here one more time because I love AYCE sushi, but I'm leaning more towards avoiding this place. On to the next, on, on to the next one!",

My wife and I are servers so we're pretty lenient with service, especially when busy, but this guy clearly showed he didn't want to serve us.

    "text": "On a scale of 1-5 (5 being best)  Food: 3 (your average AYCE sushi) Execution of Service: 1 Friendliness of staff: 2 Professionalism: 1 Overall Satisfaction: 1  Went to Goyemon for a friends birthday last Sunday after reading so many positive reviews here on yelp.    ATTN EVERYONE:  IF YOU ARE DINING IN A LARGE PARTY, THIS REVIEW IS INTENDED FOR YOU.       Our party was for 22 people, and a reservation was made for 8pm.  After most of us had arrived, we waited about 30-45 minutes to be seated, because the restaurant policy states that your entire party must be present before being seated. (We were not informed of this when the reservation was made)  The policy was strictly upheld for about half an hour before our server decided to bend the policy and allow us to sit down because half of our party were waiting in the cold for the last half hour due to space restrictions in the entryway, AND we were on the verge of leaving.)  If that wasn't enough, it grew worse in a hurry.       The server \"GIO\" was blatantly unprofessional;  no greeting, calling attention to us by shouting \"Yo\" or \"Hey\" from across the room, handing off ALL of our food to one person and instructing that person to pass it to someone else and so forth.  Every time he came to the table, he had either forgot something, made a mistake, or didn't order something for us yet.   IT TOOK 20 MINUTES TO GET THE ONLY BEER I ORDERED...       He referred to some of us as \"dog, dude, bro\" and \"that chick over there\", repeatedly forgot to place our orders, and acted as though we were wasting HIS time.  At times we had to guess what the different rolls were, because there was little effort on his part to state what they were, he didn't even know what some of them were himself!  The drink order was also a mess, and our table grew STACKED with empty plates before he decided to do anything about it.  We were also handed the bill by a different server before we got a chance to order dessert.  WTF!?  We paid in advance anyway to be polite.  By the time we had finished paying, only half our desserts were on the table, and predictably, the rest NEVER came, so we cancelled them.         For an AYCE sushi spot, some of us didn't eat very much because we had few chances to order food in one hour of service, because of all the setbacks, mistakes, and lack of effort.",

My friend came to Vegas for the first time, and I took him to Goyemon and he absolutely loved it! Servers are very nice , and the only thing is that most of the time it's packed and waiting time is a little longer but I think it is worth it if you are looking for a quality sushi place. My favorite sushi role is Pastel with cream cheese avocado and eel sauce. Make sure to ask for fresh wasabi on the side. It tastes way better with soy sauce. If you are a sushi lover like me, try this place, you won't regret it!",

    "text": "Being a very avid and frequent sushi seeker, I enjoy coming back to Goyemon, especially for the AYCE!  Although their menu is very extensive and broad with variety, I believe I have selected my fair share of must have items after about a dozen visits.    Ecstasy roll is always what I order first. Tuna based roll with a topping of seaweed salad and roe finished in a light creamy sauce. Truly fulfilled the expectation of a food high.   Salmon skin hand roll is simple but just done so right and deliciously.    Pork belly is absolutely craveable. Seriously amazing product and execution on the grill. Comes perfectly glistening in a slightly sweet and savory sauce with a refreshing acidic mango salsa to tame that rich, meaty, umami unctuousness.   All of the deserts are excellent. My favorites being the chocolate mousse, mochi ice cream, and especially the Yuzu sherbet. Its the perfect citrusy, light palate cleanser to end your meal after eating all the fatty fresh fish you can handle.   Service is really a hit or miss, as well as the wait times, which, at some visits have been disappointing enough to effect the whole meal feel vibe, and having sushi kaya as another frequent option/alternative.",

    "text": "I honestly believe this sushi place only has high ratings due to its 'endless sushi' all you can eat offer. Well, that would indeed be a great offer IF the sushi was great, or even good. Sadly, that is not the case.  The core of sushi is making good sushi rice. The rice here is quite similar to the rice you would find in a sushi roll bought from a grocery store. It's clammy, almost transparent, and almost brick-like in consistency. Simply put; it is awful. It kills all the rolls, and all the nigiri pieces. It's everywhere.  The rolls we did try were bland at best. The fish was 'meh'. I even ordered a 'sashimi salad', but it had 3-4 small pieces of tuna, and one GIANT ball of mayo-veggie mix, the thing they stuff inside California rolls. Clearly meant to fill you up for the all-you-can eat offer, it was almost disgusting to eat.   The best thing we had was the pork belly, which was delicious, and thus one star coming your way.  One thing: the air 'freshener' they use in the restrooms smells worse than the restrooms. Once in a while we would get a whiff of it and the first time I thought someone had farted. Seriously, disgusting.  Conclusion: if you like sushi from Von's or Safeway, you will LOVE this place. Otherwise... Well, keep driving..",

I do order a few of the cooked items, such as that, maybe some of the grilled specials, and oh yeah, pork belly, YUM!  I like their tuna on crispy rice too, although that's not nigiri  among the negatives, sometimes kind of busy, servers seemed overwhelmed at times would pass on the ramen....actually not sure why I even ordered that here, saw someone else order it, he was a big dude, so figured he must know whats good......WRONG! wasn't much better than top ramen from college days! you're not here for that anyways!  all in all, this is a great AYCE sushi place, reasonable, clean, fresh, etc.... give it a try, I'm sure you will add to your list of places to frequent!",

The yellowtail and garlic tuna are two of my go-to favorites. Check their chalk board for off-menu daily specials.  They have a wide selection of rolls as well. They will do half rolls if you ask and are willing to tweek a roll to your preference.  A good selection of appetizers and side orders are also included in the AYCE if you want to eat other stuff that isn't sushi. I always make sure to get plenty orders of pork belly and baked mussels. They also have ice cream and other desserts that you can get under the AYCE if you actually have room when you are done eating.  The place is kind of small and always packed, so you might have to wait a little bit if you are in a group, or you might have to eat at the bar if you are by yourself.

They have the freshest garlic ahi tuna nigiri that is a must try. About the same price as all other ayce sushi but waaaay better quality. Desserts included! Service can be a bit spotty but the sushi is so good you won't be disappointed.   **Full story**: How have I not written a review for this place yet?! I guess all the partying in vegas makes me forget about the great food I eat afterwards...lol.  Anyway, I've frequented this place every time I've come to vegas after I turned 21 and it is the best ayce sushi restaurant I've ever dined at and I've definitely visited my fair share!   I love that this place isn't overly packed even on holiday weekends; I've been here during EDC weekend and memorial day weekend. It's definitely a hidden gem just a few minutes off the strip.   The ordering system is a little different here than most other ayce sushi restaurants. Instead of giving you 3 rounds to order, they give you a 45 min limit. So you don't get a little sheet of paper that you check off, you just keep ordering from the waiters until your time is up. Your time starts when you order your first item. I haven't had a problem with this being not enough time especially since they give you a last call. However, I haven't been here when it's super packed so I can foresee that possibly being a problem for some people but haven't experienced it myself.   J casually ordered the garlic ahi tuna along with the rest of our rolls and sushi not knowing that it was going to be probably the best tuna both of us have ever tasted. The tuna was so fresh it was literally ruby red and glistening as it came out. I have never seen a more appealing cut of sushi. <a href=\"http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/sushi-house-goyemon-las-vegas?select=q8fozGYfWJbBHNHrfUgAsg#UnDx5-6zuPhFOyzBufRpSw\">yelp.com/biz_photos/sush...</a> The slightly tangy sauce that dressed the tuna was perfect and didn't require any soy sauce! We ended up ordering about 10 more orders of the tuna alone LOL.   The appetizers are pretty standard and the rolls are good too. If you read closely, you can find the rolls that are in smaller portions, about 4 pieces, which is great because you can try a bit of everything without getting too full. I'd definitely recommend coming here with a larger group so you can sample everything but even with only 2 people you can still try a variety of things.  The price is about $25 total for lunch and if you upgrade to dinner price during lunch, you can order uni and sweet shrimp as well! I'm not a fan of either so I'm content coming here and paying less for lunch :)   Anyway, definitely check this place out and TRY THE GARLIC AHI TUNA. I dream about that stuff man.",

We get seated and the waiter took our order, however she didn't look like she wanted work anymore. She took our orders without any smiles or anything. The food came out and when I ordered the fried calamari, that shit looked like some fried cheesesteaks and it was extremely chewy to get down to the gutter. The pork belly on the other hand gave me a wet orgasm as soon as I bit into it, but the first order had too much char. The sushi was decent, it didn't look too fresh though. Half way through my visit, our servers changed and the service was a lot better.",

    "text": "I was never a fan of AYCE sushi. Even after reading the good reviews about this place, I still wasn't interested in coming here since I already had a favorite sushi spot! However, we had family in town a few weeks ago who asked us to bring them here, so I finally got to see what it was all about. So many reviews here already, so I'll try to keep mine short and sweet.   A few things I would like to point out..... First, we got lucky with the wait time. They told us we would be waiting about 40 minutes. But because a big party left, it opened up like 3 tables and we only waited about 20 minutes. I thought it was kind of cool that they text you a link that shows your place in line and how long you have waited so far to keep track of your time.  Second, we unfortunately got a table that was close to the entrance door. It was so crowded and people were waiting inside the narrow entrance way (as if this place isn't tiny enough). I got annoyed because it felt like the whole time, strangers were watching me eat. Sorry, but it sucks when you cant enjoy your meal because people keep looking over your shoulder!  Lastly, I'm sorry, but the sushi just wasn't that great. I ordered a few rolls, but nothing stood out or gave me a reason to come back again. They may have sounded fancy on the menu, but the taste was disappointing. However, I will say this. Their rice to meat/fish/veggies/what have you is great. They don't pack on the rice or are not stingy with the other ingredients, which some sushi places definitely do.   Anyway, glad I finally tried it, but no thank you. I don't mind paying more for sushi that I can definitely enjoy elsewhere!",

    "text": "I was in Vegas the other weekend and I wanted some sushi. My crew and I came across this place, since the one they usually go to closed their doors for good. Upon entering, we were greeted by the hostess. My bf made the reservation and the hostess checked us in through a system where the party can see the status online of their wait time. She informed us that it'll be an hour and a half wait. So, instead of waiting, we went to a nearby casino to kill time.   We sat near the sushi bar and started browsing through the menu. We all opted for the AYCE and they had a good selection of specials written on a chalkboard. We ordered hot tea, the pixie roll, ecstasy, sea urchin (for me), and among other things.  Everything tasted fresh and yummyful. Lastly, we had room for desserts and I ate most of that chocolate mousse. And there was the green tea creme brulee and mango mousse cake. It had real chunks of mango! This has been a great dining experience for all of us, despite the restaurant not having shooters, which was something I craved for, but all in all, our waitress had done a fantastic job serving us and the place itself had a nice ambience. Heck, I was in awe when I saw the sword in the ladies' restroom. The place was nice and clean. Thank you SHG! I'll come back to visit you again!",

The rolls are good, the grill items are always changing and also good (Cajun salmon!), the tempura ice cream is bomb, and the service is pretty fast. The only negative would be on popular nights it's busy. You may end up waiting 30-45 minutes , but they text you when you're up. As far as these smaller local ayce sushi places this is still #1 to me. They're also open late so if you're out on the town you can grab a bite after . Last call is around 2am.",

The only real downside to this location is the service. Always friendly, but slow and undependable. You may get forgotten by the end of your meal.",

So usually it's really busy, but because I came earlier it was still pretty slow (no one at the sushi bar except my mom and me), with maybe about 3 tables. The kitchen service was quick and the servers were on it, but the sushi chef we sat in front of was the worst! His name was Lee, and because of him I probably will not be back for a while. He never said Hi or even looked at us. We waited patiently because he seemed to be in his own little world, but after a while I decided to ask him if we can order. Still didn't look at us and just said wait.... so again we waited. Nothing. My mom decided to just start writing down the nigiris we wanted and when he finally decided to talk to us, we handed that over to him and that was it. I've sat in front of him before and he was kind of stand-offish, but today he was just rude. I don't want to have a full conversation with the sushi chef, but it would be nice to at least feel a little respected and have a friendly greeting, or maybe at least show that you see we exist.

They have a text system for your wait time, so that's great especially because there can be a long wait. We waited about 35 minutes on a Saturday night.   Overall food was good, comparable to other quality sushi restaurants. We were sad that they didn't have any salmon belly but the fatty tuna belly was oh so delicious! It seems that for their sushi rolls they really favor crab sticks and cajun albacore, both of which we're not big on. However, the nigiri was delicious and worth the wait.",

ONLY for the stupid reason that I got alot of shrimp tempura rolls (w/o reading the menu), only to find that the rolls included items (like avocado, soy paper, and such) that I don't like. My boyfriend had to finish so much rolls I ordered during our all you can eat venture - he kinda hated me after that.  My 2nd coming to Goyemon was a SECOND COMING aka HEAVEN. Came again a few weeks ago for dinner and with a group of 7 friends. In all you can eat, a BIG group is your best friend so you can sample (SAMPS) many rolls without having to finish them all between 2 ppl (look at my previous paragraph).   I let my friends order this time and they ordered correct. My favorite rolls were the Sexy Girl and ALLLLLLLLLLLLL the specials.  Tuna on crispy rice was amazing. I love the texture change with the soft sweet tuna and crispy rice.  But, my favorite had to be the PORK BELLY. That was fall off your chopstick tender and the sauce/marinate was so goooooooooooooooooood =) I'd take my regular rolls and dip it on the pork belly plate to mop up the leftover sauce.  We had to have ordered 20+ orders of the pork belly --- I LOVE that their AYCE also includes these/all their specials.  Ever since then, I've been having dreams about their pork belly.  If I could come here everytime for dinner and eat just THAT and rice; I'd be one happy (and maybe, fat) lady!",

Some of my favorites are the domingo roll (ask for spicy tuna inside), the lemon roll. 9-1-1 (super spicy) and the baked 428 (chicken inside).  The nigiri is also very good.  Last time I visited Goyemon I had the bluefin tuna, squid and octopus all of which were delicious and melt in your mouth.  Just make sure you don't order more than you can eat because you will be charged for any food left on your plate.  Order 1/2 rolls if you want to try a  lot of different things.",

    "text": "For what this is - an AYCE restaurant - we give Goyemon four stars.  My only disappointment was that some items were unavailable (e.g. yellowtail collar) and presentation was messy at times. If you have a dish with only one piece of fish, I think you should make it look good. But then again, this isn't Raku...  We thought the nigiri was fine, but not the greatest quality - there was also a point when our second round of tuna and yellowtail nigiri tasted very \"fishy.\" Our happiness factor went mostly to the cold tofu and other grilled specials. Also, the desserts were great and UNIQUE. Most AYCEs serve the standard mochi/ice cream (not that it's not delicious). We enjoyed our plum wine jello and green tea creme brulee.  The ambiance and decor were A+. The restaurant had a good vibe, chill music, and attentive service. We were happy to be served quickly; our rolls were never more than five minutes away.  If anything, Goyemon must be visited simply because it's like the prettier sister of other AYCEs.",

Only thing i have to say is after 6:00 be prepared for a long wait. I got there around 5:45 and by 6:15 there was a long line out the door and a bunch of people sitting around outside. I dont mind a little bit of a wait at a super nice restaurant but a long wait at a locals sushi place not really cool. Thankfully I got there before the rush otherwise I wouldnt have eaten here.",

    "text": "Over-rated and worst AYCE sushi place !  Sushi rolls are inflated with more rice than you can imagine than the fish !!! Seems that they wanted you to be filled so you can stop requesting for more sushi. Service was terrible!!! This place needs an overhaul of their operations and taking orders from the customer. Our sushi roll took forever to about 30 minutes which turned out that the server gave it to the other table. Once the server realized that she gave our order to the other table, she simply took it from the other table and handed it to our table, without realizing that it was already half eaten by the other table. The server has an attitude too and has to re-write the order all over again.  The AYCE deal is a ripoff. It is good for 1 hour but the order takes an average of 20 minutes to be completed and you can only order 4 at a time. Lucky enough if you get your order right.     I have asked for the manager that evening, but the server and host refused to get him/her . This place could use an automatic POS ordering system rather than a piece of paper or rely on the memory of the server!!!",

I love nigiri, but I wanted to spit out the tuna because it tasted way too old. The salmon roll was difficult to swallow as well. The service was HORRIBLE! The WORST service I have ever had at a sushi place. All the tables near us had their orders mixed up or the order never came. A huge waste of time when they have an hour time limit for AYCE. The presentation of the sushi was also horrible. They were messy, some had fallen apart, and some of the fish looked like it had been cut with safety scissors. The food is not inedible, but save your money and go somewhere else for much better sushi at the same price.",

The other day my sister and I went to eat AYCE and she came home with food poisoning. Threw up everything on the floor. And she hasn't thrown up in 9 years! We ate the exact same food except I didn't eat super white tuna. I know that super white tuna asks like a laxative and makes people want to use the bathroom but this occurrence showed me that there must be something wrong with their food. I'm not upset but that but more that I kindly called the restaurant to warn them. The receptionist said the manager would call me back and he never did to apologize or thank that I took the time to warn them before they poison other people. She even asked for my name and number. Will not be returning. Very bittersweet since I love Goyemon's food.",

We were only there for a little over an hour, and we were just finishing our beer, which only had about 1/4 left. She basically asked us to leave just because the table that came way after us wanted to use our table along with what they already have. I understand being busy, and needing the table. This is why we didn't want to take forever, and I even paid for the check as soon as the last plate cleared out. I was fine with it, and I asked for 5 minutes to wrap up our night and to finish the beer. She was rude and abruptly said no. I did not appreciate that gesture, especially after I paid about $80 for two people and gave no trouble to everyone. This special night with a friend was basically ruined by the lack of costumer service skills and insensitivity of the manager. She ruined this place for us, and by the looks of the other Yelp reviews, she did the same for a lot of other people too.",

The two chefs behind tghe sushi counter were both very jovial and friendly and happily obliged as my friend and I put away about 30 nigiri in about 30 minutes.. then it was on to sashimi and pork belly.. on their suggestion. Really I think they were trying to keep us happy and use up product for the day, which was a WIN situation for us as we are hungry guys. Everything tasted so good and fresh.

But I think people really over rated it maybe they havent been to a better sushi place or I ordered the wrong stuff? (not trying to be mean but .....=/ I am quite disappointed). I would like to give this place a 3.5/5 .  We went there around 7pm and we were seated within 15mins. We had all you can it. The food came out fast and the waiters cleaned up the dishes fast too (Even I havent finished the whole dish lol)   *****THE FOOD *****  Sweet Shrimp Nigiri - 1 order each person, it was just okay. Nothing good and bad about it. Maybe good thing about the Nigiri is that the rice is small so you don't have to eat too much rice.  Sea Urchin Nigiri - 1 order each person, the sea urchin tasted like it has been in the fridge for a very long time. Neither fresh nor sweet.  Hotate Nigiri - taste good with soy sauce but usually hotate are kinda tasteless. (And i think they added some lemon juice on it)  Yakitori - I think they didn't marinated the chicken; they just added some sauce on it.  Dynamite - Quite good :)  Baked Green Mussel - The size of the mussel is a little bit bigger than the other sushi place. The flavor is the same throu.  Grilled yellowtail - quite good (u can pick teriyaki/ ponzu sauce)  Grilled Pork Belly - Actually I like this :) Quite good !!  Yakisoba - Nothing good or bad about it.  Green Tea creme brulee - (one order per person) I think not much sushi place has this as dessert. It was good since im a big fan of green tea brulee. Maybe it can be a little bit cooler?  \"Tofu\" Cheese cake - I dun think they added tofu??? cant taste or smell any tofu.  Im not gonna comment on the roll because i think they are not good at all. :(  And they were out of Kama that night .... :(  I think im not gonna go back to this place or if i do, i wont do all you can eat. I will just have some green tea creme brulee.  *****OTHERS *****  But the interior design of this place is quite good.  And our server Diane is very nice and helpful.",

This place is awesome and has all the typical fish you'll see at all of the AYCE places in town.  Definitely do the grilled pork belly like everyone recommends. My faves:  - Super White Tuna - Kobe Beef(1 peice) - Uni  - Halibut - Big Eyed Tuna - Tuna Rice Cracker - Sashimi Salad  Only downside is that its small be prepared to wait.",

The restaurant is in a plaza with plenty of parking (spaces are arrange awkwardly though). They're opened 5PM to 3AM, great for the early dinner people and the late night munchies crowd. The restaurant is not huge, but I would say big enough for at least 50 patrons. All you can eat (AYCE) is $27.    The menu seems to be the same as Sushi Mon, all except the extra items that were added to the blackboard and featured on the place mat. Some of the items were:  Grilled Tofu Salad (<a href=\"http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/JyxHvtj-syke7m9rbza7mA?select=uTwz4uGpvFM6H8EttW-MVg\">yelp.com/biz_photos/JyxH...</a>). I've never had grilled tofu before, but it was interestingly good. The taste of the grilled tofu with a garlic sesame sauce was a good way to start the night.   Grilled Pork Belly (<a href=\"http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/JyxHvtj-syke7m9rbza7mA?select=1pQReeZwUFgCpzY7qJ5rfA\">yelp.com/biz_photos/JyxH...</a>). Was similar to Monta's pork, but in a thick slice form.  Speaking of Monta, for whatever reason the Shoyu ramen is offered after 11pm. Not sure if the tonkutsu or miso are offered as well.  Extra desserts not on the regular menu were tofu cheesecake, green tea creme brulee, and a green tea mousse cake, all were presented nicely and a nice touch for a AYCE sushi place.   What I really enjoyed was the quality of the fish for a AYCE place. It was like they were not affected by the economy and continue to serve fish that wasn't chewy or smelled. Yay, but too bad they still use krab.   The service was excellent was well, the server checked up on my party quite often and we did not have to wait long receive our orders. One of my friend's ordered a shrimp nigiri and a few moments later the server came back asking if he wanted to try deep fried shrimp heads as well, with no cost of course since its AYCE. They actually want you to enjoy your meal haha.  Another plus is that I don't have to drive all the way to Maryland Pwky to get some quality AYCE anymore. If you feel the same way then.. *high five*.",

Either way I think our taste buds and appetites would have been satisfied.  Next time though I'm going after that AYCE!  We were ignorant in not reading the menu thoroughly.  A handful of the items we ordered were included in the AYCE menu.  You get 60 minutes to eat your share of sushi.  Oh yeah!  It's possible and then some.  It's a pity we weren't hungry last night but it gives me something to look forward to when I go to Las Vegas again.  As far as our food, we ordered the following:  Grilled Pork Belly - 2 orders Amaebi Uni Sushi Sushi & Sashimi for 2 Moon Roll Screaming Orgasm Yellowtail Collar Green Tea Creme Brulee Tempura Ice Cream  Everything was good with maybe the exception of the tuna from the Sushi & Sashimi for 2.  Otherwise, everything was excellent!  I highly recommend the Screaming Orgasm, Pork Belly, and Amaebi, all of which are included in the AYCE.  Truly a great sushi find in Las Vegas, and one that's open late till 3am.",

A bit long, but expected on a Saturday night. It's nice that they have two tables outside for parties waiting rather than standing.   When you walk inside, the place is very cozy, but not overly crowded. I also noticed the menu was very similar to Sushi-Mon. The service was very fast and we hardly had to wait for our food to come out. That was a definite plus. When you're here, you gotta get the baked mussels, salmon belly, and pork belly.   My only issue was that my green tea ice cream and vanilla mochi ice cream was pretty melted by the time it got to me. Other than that, Goyemon is a pretty good place to grab AYCE. I'll definitely be coming back here again especially since they offer stamp cards!",

So we get there and the lady says its a 45 minute wait really? wow ok, so they take our number and they call us about 45 minutes later so they were True to their word. (Maybe it wouldn't be a 45 minute wait if there were more then 12 tables thats just my thought.)   So on to the \"delicious\" sushi everyones bragging about we both got ayce this is what i ordered  -royal california  -mingus -taylor -sushi mon style lasagna   They were all ok at best i do NOT like the tempura they use on the rolls its super crispy and the texture is super weird which sucks for me because i like tempura rolls.  My fiance on the other hand enjoyed his sushi and said he would give it 4 stars mind you he will eat anything and thinks everything tastes fantastic so his opinion doesnt count to me lol.   I really expected better sushi the way everyone was talking this place up over all the food was ok at best, the atmosphere was uncomfortable it felt like i was having dinner with complete strangers at my table because thats how close and jammed they have the tables set up and I definitely think 45 minutes is to long to wait for any place let alone a mediocre sushi joint like this.   This place is waaaaayyyy over rated!!!!",

He kept on looking through the sushi bar to see if we had any more sushi left. We ate at the bar, and only received at least 1 to 2 plates at a time, no more than that. We had to order the same nigiri 3 times until he finally made it after my friend looked straight into his eyes. Paid for the bill as we where soo annoyed. Before I left, I asked the workers if they ran out of certain sushi items, they said no!!! I am a regular here for over 5 yrs, and this is the first time I felt pissed off and left hungry. It's like I order food sitting at the bar, he says yes, looks through the bar, and takes someone else's order and makes it. Zero stars for that guy Frank, 4 stars for food and service from the servers. Next time I see that he's working, I'm going to request not to have him serve us. It's better placing your orders with servers while sitting at a table if he's there- I never had an issue with anyone else. I left hungry at an All you can eat restaurant where the food is great, but service from the BOH sushi cook killed the whole experience, especially for a regular local",

My biggest knock on the place is the service - once our original drink order was delivered, we had to ask for our waters to be refilled twice.  As for the food, the fish was fresh for the most part (the albacore and japanese white fish were a little on the fishy side, but still edible), and I couldn't believe what all they offered in their AYCE menu.  Salmon belly was phenomenal, and we had a bunch of 1/2 rolls, allowing us to try a lot more variety than we were prepared for.  The green tea creme brulee was out of this world good - and I'm not a huge fan of either green tea OR creme brulee!

We waited 50 min for a table but a couple came in that seemed to know them and got seated right away when I confronted her about it and she just had a glazed look . She was a moron . No personality and to think she's the face of this establishment . The service last night was horrible even the table next to us commented on the bad service . They ordered miso soup and 20 min later no soup . Our sushi took forever and 2 times they brought the wrong order . They need new management.",

    "text": "This place advertises that you can get 1 order each of uni and amaebi when you go for AYCE, but it's just a bait and switch tactic to get you in the door. Because what they don't tell you is that if they run out of either of those two \"premium\" (and they are) items, you can't substitute it for something else of equal or lesser value. So once you're in, they're likely to tell you they're out of one, or both, of those items. That way, you pay the AYCE price thinking you'll be able to get those items, and they don't actually have to serve them to you. All they have to do is keep serving you the same, cheap stuff you can get at any other AYCE, and thereby saving them money, and making more off of you and me; the duped customer.  It's really ingenious marketing, if you think about it. These guys are brilliant.... at least at making suckers out of their customers!",

Starting off with the good stuff, what to order:  -UNI!!!!  -Garlic Edamame to whet the palate  -seaweed salad (I mean, don't you get this pretty much everywhere you go?) -Cajun Albacore -Garlic Tuna -Yum Yum Scallop -Yebisu Roll (super light & fresh)  -Ecstasy Roll -No Name Roll  -OID Roll -Sexy Girl  -Hurricane -Athena  -Stacy -Rock n Roll -Green Tea Creme Brulee  You can order half rolls here, I would advise that you do so. Food comes out SUPER quick, I felt like we had half of our rolls on the table before we even finished giving them the order! Place is always slammed, so be prepared to wait at least 30 minutes.  A bit nicer atmosphere-wise than most sushi places I've visited in Vegas, so that's great! Honestly, my favorite sushi spot in Vegas! GET IT.",

We ordered a lot of nigiri and while the quality was very good for AYCE, it was not good enough for nigiri or sashimi.   The one hour time limit and strict rules regarding uneaten food made me nervous but in the end, we had enough time to stuff ourselves.",

So you are not looking at a buffet with food sitting out, for who knows how long.  They offer quality nigiri sushi and the good stuff too: Uni, Ikura, Amaebi to name a few.  For all those who love the rolls they have an extensive list to choose from and cooked item too.  GREAT: * quality of sushi * selection of food to choose from  GOOD: * service - they get so slammed, you need a little patience for good food * price and quality - for Vegas and AYCE this is a deal  OKAY: * place is a bit small, so seating is limited * make a reservation, what does that hurt, you know you are going",

Unless I missed a new trend in genetic engineering, there is no such thing as bright fuchsia colored tuna or brilliant orange salmon.  What's worse is many items (tuna, hamachi, salmon, shrimp) have a dry, rubbery texture as if it was previously frozen and thawed using tap water.  The rice is seasoned well but is so compacted, it's the densest sushi I've ever had.  Decent creativity but by the end of the meal, I never wanted to hear \"yum yum sauce\" again.  This mayo based concoction is slathered on almost everything.  Cloying and fatty, even hot tea can't cut its mouth grip.  Service was OK, I mean I did get a menu, water, food, and the check but with every additional order, I felt less like a welcome guest and more like a theif hacking away at the profit.  Maybe a bad night?  I doubt it. The fundamentals are wrong.  Not worth it considering how many better AYCE restaurants dot Vegas.",

We also ordered some rolls which came out in good timing.and for the most part i remembered all of them being pretty good.   The one roll that i actually rememered ordering was the 911 Roll, and they were not lying, that stuff is SPICY!  Service was decent as well, our server came back often enough for us to order more once i plate was done.  As for the menu. I would say this would be the perfect place for you if you like eating just rolls. They have a whole bunch of rolls to choose from. But for other plates, such as hot dishes and all that sort, not much of a selection. But sushi rolls yes.",

Wish they'd let you call while you're on the way to put yourself on the list but yeah :( they also won't seat you if your entire party is not present so beware your late friends. ;b  My favorite roll is the Sexy Girl but aside from that,  I'm a salmon nigiri girl all the way.",

We threw down on many sushi rolls that night.   Restaurant is small, good for parties of 2-4 people but it seems that when big groups come in they have trouble managing. Service was a bit slow, but it was to be expected, as it was a full house.  Sushi is good, but that's about all you can say to describe it. Very generic menu that you see at most AYCE places up and down Spring Mountain. Not complaining, but nothing that is really a WOW factor. We ordered about 10 different rolls in all. The waitress stared at me in disbelief, like I'm some sort of human garbage disposal. She's not wrong.

I gave it a four stars due to the fact that it's an awesome restaurant but sometimes wait times are just crazy long and like all sushi places, it's tiny.

I don't know if it's an off day but I'm a patient person, and don't ask for much and a server myself and I had to flag our server down a lot. I hate doing that.   I'd still come back tho! If service improves I'll bump it up to 5 stars. Thank you!",

Goyemon is the best AYCE sushi. Everything on their menu tasted so good. Even their green tea and mochi ice cream is yummy. I like how they make their rolls a little smaller than normal, gives you enough room in your tummy to try other items on their menu.   Great friendly service. Our waitresses were so nice to us. Definitely coming back here when i'm in Vegas.",

    "text": "This was such an unreal dining experience! The food kept coming and coming... and it was ALL good!  For an All You Can Eat place, I was really surprised at the quality of the sushi ...so fresh and beautifully prepared!  My friend was celebrating her birthday in Vegas, and I was her chauffeur. Her aunt and uncle invited us to dinner - how can I refuse a free meal?  We used Google Maps which took us to the townhouses right after the restaurant. If you drive there, slow down and look for the sign for the restaurant!   We got there at 4pm which is a great time - before the crowd gets there. The contemporary, clean, beautiful interior matched the beautiful, organized plates of sushi. I'm not sure about the service. It seemed like aunty kept asking about her order of Hamachi and our server kept replying that he would \"check on it\". Eventually, it did arrive.   The amount of rice was the big surprise... I thought it would be a lot so that we would fill up faster. This was not the case. The fish-to-rice ratio was perfect! Also, I didn't taste any added wasabi - just add your own!  The ikura, saba, scallops (with a hint of lime), maguro, uni, unagi, & amaebi were superb! We also had some of the special rolls (Caterpillar and Dragon) for fun!   We were supposed to be there for just 2 hours but they didn't chase us out. We did see the line to get in, so it was time to go and let the next set of customers have their turn!  I'll go with you if you need a ride!",

    "text": "Some might say that you shouldn't compromise when looking for a great place to eat. This is one place where you should.  Let me elaborate. You'll never experience top-of-the-line fish quality at Goyemon. You won't have the best uni, the most delectable tuna, or the sweetest shrimp. You might have to wait for an hour or more, especially if you bring a larger group. But you'll always be able to have as much reasonable-quality fish (and other tasty things) as you please for $26.95 (or $21.95 for lunch, but that's irrelevant - more info later). You'll always impress friends and family from out of town (disclaimer: yours may not be as cool as mine). Compared to Strip buffets, you'll get superior value, more-than-sufficient variety, and zero lining up in front of heat lamps. Yes, newbies: you place orders here like you would at a normal restaurant, and they cook and prep to order.  At Goyemon, choosing dinner (starts at 4pm) is an absolute must. If you don't go for dinner, you won't get grilled pork belly, multiple types of grilled fish (cajun salmon, super white, yellowtail, even salmon kama occasionally), the crowd-pleasing spicy tuna rice cracker, or the extra desserts that often include chocolate mousse, green tea creme brulee (I actually dislike this), yuzu sorbet, and extra mochi flavors. You'll also miss the uni - generally not \"good\" but at least passable, unlike some other places - and amaebi. I tried lunch once a few months back and was surprised that they do offer nigiri specials, but I missed my dinner exclusive so much.  The rotating nigiri specials are rarely or less reliably found at other AYCE places. Salmon belly is often available. Kanpachi (amberjack) is another nice option that I can't recall seeing elsewhere. Conch (rhymes with honk) is a surprisingly good too. Occasionally on holidays or perhaps at some manager's whim, they'll have blue fin tuna or even toro available as specials. They've had a few anniversary or special items from time to time too with special pricing and expanded menu (invariably drawing huge crowds or rapidly filling time slots). These rare treats are always nice.  I'll just list some other items that I almost always order: sashimi salad, baked green mussels (it's not overly sauced), super white tuna nigiri, fresh scallop (\"hotate\") nigiri, yellowtail nigiri, lychee sorbet, green tea ice cream (best texture and flavor I've had at any sushi place). Also, the moon and hurricane rolls (usually half-orders).  I congratulate and empathize with all the reviewers who have seemingly lucked into poor service. I may have had relatively slow service once or twice in the past, but it's been reliable the last few times and has left a good impression in long-term memory. If you're with a very small group, sit at the bar for likely improved sushi response times (the servers still cover appetizers/grilled items and drinks). And in general, don't sabotage yourself by under-ordering. I'd say 7-12 items per order is a good range.  After dozens of visits over the years, Goyemon is still consistently the best AYCE sushi place that I've ever had the pleasure to enjoy. Others in town are close, and at least one has marginally superior fish quality, but I'll always bemoan a lack of dessert variety (if it's not one per person, which is a huge negative for those places), a lack of my favorite grilled items, a lack of a stamp card (buy 10 and get a free meal), or something else possibly nitpicky. This is the jewel of the surprisingly good AYCE sushi scene of the desert.",

Definitely gave the bf and I a chance to try everything...well, almost everything. Most of the items (practically all) are available for AYCE, and we very much enjoyed the jellyfish nigiri, and most of the rolls. I think the regular nigiri has too much rice, though I'm comparing to crazy joints such as Asahi sushi and AYCE sushi back in Cali. I don't have much experience with AYCE in Vegas yet, but I do think that Goyemon's quality and unique combos make it one of the top in the area. Definitely a go-to joint, at least to try once!  Small note...joint gets PACKED even at midnight, so come prepared to wait at least 30 minutes.",

    "text": "Goyemon is largely heralded as the best AYCE sushi in Vegas. A member of the Mon restaurant group (which also includes Monta and Sushi-Mon), this spot is generally regarded as their best effort and highest quality.   Unfortunately, by the time I finally made a trip here, I was underwhelmed. Maybe my familiarity with their Sushi-Mon location on Sahara is to blame- their menus are virtually identical, with Goyemon offering additional items at dinner and some more unique specials. The quality of fish was good, but having a friendly relationship with a Sushi Mon chef garnered me the same product at their sister store. I really didn't see the upside to coming here instead.  Service during my recent visit was frustrating- server did not come around very often, food was came out slow and sporadic, and rice was falling apart on all rolls and nigiri. Not what I expect given the reputation that precedes this joint. They were busy, but not overwhelmed.   I will say that the menu of rolls is extensive and their pricing is very fair ($22/lunch, $27/dinner). It's also nice that their last dinner seating is at 2AM. Better to visit for dinner than lunch, for increased menu options. But frankly I just found it good, not great.  TLDR Standby items: superwhite tuna, garlic tuna, mackerel, and halibut nigiri; Lemon, Moon, Hurricane and Ecstasy rolls. They were out of uni my last visit, appreciate that this was on signage as you entered. Don't bother with the tuna poke, miso soup, or mochi dessert.",

When we were sat, we were crammed so close to our neighbors we might as well have been eating together. Took a while for server to get our drink order, took a while to get drinks and refills. Service was lackluster, no personality, no smiles. Location isn't great or easy to get to. Lot's of douchey smokers out front right outside the entrance.  This place has great food, but they need to expand to a bigger location if they're so busy. There are plenty of sushi places that have great food and don't make me wait all night just to sit right next to strangers. I probably won't go back to Goyemon despite the good food which did come out very fast after ordering. I'd suggest you try this place for lunch.",

Then after we ate we were promptly kicked out due to a time frame, ahhh, there are six of us, not everyone shovels food down their mouth. Would never return again.",

They also have other dishes that are included in the AYCE menu, compared to other restaurants who offer extra, or offer \"non-sushi\" dishes, ala carte. I always come here often with family and friends as I think that the food is always worth the price. Due to its popularity, there is always a long wait before you get seated especially during dinner time.",

It get packed, so arrive early and preferably during non rush hours. The wait can be killer.   Goyemon has fresh sushi and great ingredients. Before eating at Goyemon, I was not a fan of Uni (sea urchin) because of the texture and flavor. Little did I know what great uni tasted like. I'm a believer. As far as their sushi goes, I'm a fan.   I would recommend trying their all you can eat.Know what you want, don't be afraid to try their specials of the day. It's hard to go wrong at Goyemon. I haven't had a dish that I was not fond of. Pick what you like, highly likely you'll enjoy it.  Be forewarned, their service can be a little on the slow side, but you can compensate for that by ordering a lot when they take your first order, that way you won't be like that Brian B. guy who left a stupid ass comment on this great sushi house. If I took 22 people to Sushi Sasabune, I would get horrible service too. Moron. Next time go to Todai or something.",

I also love the salad dressing,  great flavor. The only downside is the need more servers and for goodness sake all white meat chicken as an option! Customer service is awesome!

This place includes appetizers, basic and specialty rolls, nigiri,  and desserts! And you can order 1/2 rolls on most so that you can try as many things as possible. And the food is as good as it would be if you were just ordering al la cart. Not lesser quality because it's AYCE.  The restaurant is clean and classy. It was busy but we went early and avoided a long wait. We were the only non-Asians eating there, so we knew that was a good sign! The selection of rolls is amazing. And even though there is an hour time limit, the service is fast and you can order as much as you'd like at any time. They charge you for what you can't finish, but since all 4 of us had the AYCE, you can share amongst the table which is cool and nothing was left behind. Oh, and the tempura ice cream was great!  With the AYCE being only $24.95 a person, it was a great deal for the amount of food we ate and tried. I think we ate over $85 worth per couple.  Would try to come back when in Vegas again. My friends and husband were raving fans and praised me for finding this gem by searching on yelp!",

My husband give a cash tip 25% every time we come. I can tell we really love your place.  2 months ago, my doctor found diabetic on me. I have to do a diet control at home.  But yesterday is our anniversary.  My husband say today its gonna be my cheat day. I am so happy.. I miss your restaurant so much.  My husband order all you can eat, he start order for himself first and order 2 chicken skewer, 2 seaweed salad and 1 order salmon sushi for me. That's all he plan for my cheat day.  When I'm done, my husband call server to order more for himself not for me and I'm already full.  Your server come to grab the plate and point at my 3 pcs left over rice and say \"You can't left the rice, this is all you can eat that's included everything we serve\"  I smiling back and say \"I know. I'm sorry, I already full. I already ate 4 pcs I can't take too much rice\"  She continue ask \"Where are you from ?? You should know in Las Vegas we serve all you can eat that mean you can't left the rice\"  My husband reply \"We know.... We local but because my wife have a diabetic ..the rice make her blood sugar higher and she already full\"  She say back with her unprofessional tone voice and un-smiling face \"ITS NO EXCEPTION. If you know you can not have rice .. you have to order a la carte NOT all you can eat\"  Then she walk to other server and said loud \"No one can left the rice or noodle for all you can eat\"  ....We look each other..... What just happen ?!?  Couple minutes later...  She come back with bill in her hand and ask \"Any desert ? If not ...this is your bill I give you a 20% discount for this meal\"  HOW RUDE IS IT !!!!!  My husband not even order his next order yet ... and she come back with the bill....  I feel sad, embarrass, upset and disappoint.  Its hard for me enough to live with diabetic but its harder when the place you love its not welcome.   Your staff not mention anything. No sign. No any word write down on the menu that's people on dietary control can not order all you can eat or even in this restaurant.  I am work in F&B also....  So many way to response your customer to make them happy and many word to suggest them to give you a money.  Now I feel uncomfortable to come back again.  You may think only me left is OK but I think if your restaurant still keep the rude staff like I just met... one day another customer will found same experience as me.  Thank you for your time again.",

Most places give you bad quality especially if its AYCE, but Goyemon is different all their selections were fresh.  My favorite thing here were the scallops. I don't think I have ever been to an AYCE place where they offer this. The yuzu is pretty strong on this, but I love yuzu anyways. You can also request for fried shrimp heads here! I also like the salmon eggs with a quail egg on top, very rich and creamy but so so good. I can't say much about the rolls since I don't usually eat them but my boyfriend loves them. The rice to fish ratio is also very fair.   You have to try the lychee sorbet here as well, it comes with little lychee jelly bits inside and it is so refreshing after such a heavy meal. I will come back here again and again! There is usually a wait, but its never longer than 15 minutes for me.",

First off, go early for dinner ($26.95). You'll be seated in 5-10 minutes. The service is also better when they're not super busy. Kudos to our waitress Gabby, she was AWESOME, sweet and attentive!! She definitely awesome service!   We pretty much order only nigiri sushi. 1 pair of uni and sweet shrimp for each person, everything else is AYCE. Had some apps as well. Their fish was super fresh! When you go early, look for their salmon belly!! We ordered 5 orders when we sat down, 15 minutes later it was sold out! Yellowtail collar was good. Snapper, Yellowtail, Halibut, Tuna, Yellow Tuna (I think it was Escolar), etc., were all fresh!   Down everything down with a large bottle or Orion beer (my favorite Japanese beer). If I lived in Vegas, this would be my go to place for fresh AYCE sushi.   10 minutes from the strip. Go early, avoid the rush or else you'll be wait 30+ minutes for a table.",

    "text": "My sister and her husband have eaten at this restaurant a few times when they've visited Las Vegas.  Thought we'd give them a try on our recent trip.  It's located in a strip mall on S. Decatur Blvd., south of Tropicana Avenue.   It's not fancy, but they were pretty full with customers when we arrived on Sunday night for dinner.   They offer AYCE sushi for less than $30.  There is also a separate menu for ala carte sushi/rolls or combination dinners.  I didn't want to stuff myself, so opted for the teriyaki salmon combo which came with miso soup, salad, California rolls, and tempura ($10.95).  The portions were pretty generous, except for the 2 skinny pieces of shrimp tempura.  Wish the shrimp were a little bigger.  My husband ordered the sushi combo ($11.95) and my brother-in-law had the tempura udon ($8.50).    Prices were reasonable for what we ate. The restaurant is a little dark and cramped, so don't go expecting too much by way of ambiance or service.    I'd go back again.  If I'm really hungry, I may even try the AYCE.",

I was disappointed, I wanted it to be hot, the unagi was too salty for me.   We were seated at the bar and the lady who made our sushi was very sweet.   Appetizers and desserts like Mochi ice cream were included in the AYCE. Their mochi ice cream is soft and perfect not frozen and hard! They only have 2 flavors tho.. strawberry and vanilla.",

You wouldn't think that in this small plaza there is a great delicious Japanese restaurant. They have all you can eat lunch and dinner. And if you are not up to having an all you can eat you can actually get serve al carte. Bento boxes and individual serving of sushi. But if you truly can get down with eating a lot of sushi and have some dessert ? i would have to recommend the all you can eat. Pricing is not too steep considering it is so much worth it. The place is clean and looks great. They also have sushi bar to enjoy. I do recommend this place. Happy fish day!",

It used to always be brought up in Yelp forums and was subjectively and debatably the best AYCE sushi in Vegas by far.  I honestly stopped going because it was always busy. Now there are a lot of comparable places in town that do really good appetizers and nigiri.  I went back a couple of weeks ago and I still feel like they got it but they're definitely not top dog.  Goeymon has good nigiri and good rolls. Their claim to fame for me is how they manage to serve their rolls at the perfect time. I'm talking warm sushi rice, hot just fried shrimp, and cool veggies. It's magic. It's amazing how much better fresh fried shrimp is in a roll or in any capacity than a cold piece of shrimp fried earlier in the day.  Also! Check out their specials! They have TONS of off the menu fish for nigiri that are awesome! I had sea cucumber the other day-WHO DOES THAT!?  Also their now off the menu pork belly is still phenomenal.   There's not much to say about reviewing AYCE sushi places. Goeymon has a great balance of the three sushi categories: Appetizers, nigiri, and rolls.   They have one of the best nigiri varieties in the city.    I still love Goeymon but Sakana still has my heart.  Service was good as always, seating is still crowded with small tables, But solid food for sure.",

The idea of all you can eat sushi didn't seem 100% appealing to me, but traveling with a group means I've got to go with the flow so we went.  I was impressed by their extensive menu and lots of options.  Be careful when you order though, because they charge you for leftovers, including rice!  It's hard not to get full quickly when you eat rice.  Also, there is a limit for how long you can dine.  I believe it is 45 minutes for lunch and 60 minutes for dinner.  They were nice enough to let us purchase the dinner menu to order additional items only available on the dinner menu.    They also have some ice cream and dessert options, so save room for that.  Overall it was a good experience.  The fish quality wasn't bad.  I wouldn't oppose going here again, but I wouldn't seek out this place or be excited to go again.  It was my first all you can eat sushi experience, and I'd recommend it to anyone who would like to try it for their first time.",

Thought that was rude figuring we waited close to an hour to be sat and was finishing up... Then a customer came to the table and asked how long we would be because this was there table.

The quality of the fish from the 1st order and our last order was so different. At first, fish was cut clean and about the same size.

But they had great specialty rolls just like sushi mon. It took a lil long for rolls and ahi poke was so-so. People reviewing it talked about green tea creme brulee. But they didnt have it on menu. So i was a little dissapointed. But generally happy wit the whole experience.",

I LOVE SALMON.  we ate tons and tons of nigiri, from scallops to crab, to salmon, of course, to ebi, to sweet shrimp, to uni. we sprinkled our nigiri craze with some great sides. the grilled calamari, shrimp tempura, seaweed salad, cajun salmon, pork belly, baked mussels, and mochi ice creams were amazing. the orgasm salad, super white tuna, lychee sorbet, green tea creme brulee were so-so. next time i come back, i want to try some of their rolls! can't wait!!!!",

Even though we didn't AYCE it for those that are hungry it's a bargain, do it. Salmon, yellowtail and white tuna sashimi, bomb. I love hand rolls with no rice, chef refused to make my hand rolls with no rice but made them a cut roll instead and he hit it outta da park all, great rich fat rolls with no rice, great job. Those of u that love Philly rolls, try this it's hella worth it, order their Supreme Salmon roll and ask them to add the cream cheese, it's a buck more, but worth it.

The nigiri was very fresh. The sake and white tuna were the best. The uni and sweet shrimp (only allowed one per order) were very good too.  It was hard that you have to eat all of the rice. I would recommend not get any of the rolls. None of the four that we ordered were that good. The 911 roll was good but very very spicy. The spider roll was not authentic at all.   All the side orders are very yummy. The shrimp tempura, spicy chicken teriaky, seaweed salad, etc.   Would definitely go back next time I am in Vegas.",

When our party of 8 sat, we waited for about 15 minutes before we got greeted for drinks. She came to the table without a hello or anything. She had no personality no enthusiasm and the only thing she had to say was that my 6 year old son can't eat the shrimp.  Please take Po to the back to mop the floors and clean the bathrooms or something.  She doesn't belong at the front of house.  She ruined Goyemon for me and now I'm gonna ruin Goyemon to anyone who asks me what sushi restaurant I suggest.   Bye Pa.",

    "text": "When it comes to AYCE sushi I have a pretty simple list of items that I must have to satisfy my experience and I'll usually order them all a few times throughout.   - They must have shrimp tempura, which they had but it was pretty basic and wasn't as crispy or meaty as I would have preferred.  I also would mind it being a little different seasoning wise.  Also I might have been spoiled by the last AYCE place I've been to which offered golden crispy prawns.   - They must have uni, which they had, nothing bad about it.  I loved the uni.  It was fresh looking and very tasty and come with a quail's egg different but perfect. I must have more of this next time.  - They must have poke, which they had in tako or ahi, tasty but it was just OK.  It was more of a salad as there were a lot more seaweed and other ingredients then tako or ahi.  Little too.  - Specialty rolls and dishes.  They have the pork belly which is tasty but I would've liked it with more meat or just cooked longer, firmer and crunchier too.  For special rolls I've tried the pixie roll and sexy girl roll, really liked them both. I'll try to do more specialty rolls next time since I only tried 2 and since I'm thinking I'm going to love those rolls the better.   - They must have oysters, preferably grilled but I'll do battered and fried which is what they had. It was good or OK but still loved to have the grilled ones.   Based on my list it was just OK for me a 3.  Away from my list, they have conch nigiri which seemed cool but I found it not so good since it the first time having conch, it rubbery and tasteless.  They have baked green mussels which I liked. They have AYCE desserts which I loved, most places only offer 1 dessert with AYCE. Here I had the lychee sorbet, green tea creme brulee, and mango mousse shot. They were out of the tempera ice cream which was a bummer since that was the only dessert I really wanted.  For service they did an excellent job.  It was a UYE and we did not have to wait for a table to be setup, only for the yelps to show up.  We had half of the VIP room, shared with some other loud party but it was all good since they left half way through our dinner. We stayed 3 hours and was not bothered \"Hey you gotta leave\". They also were cool with separating the checks for each of us.  Goyemon is very good.  They have items that stood out like the pork belly and the uni with quail egg nigiri but there were also some misses.  It was also my first time here so I will have to give them a 3.5 or 4 for now with the possibility of improving after my next visit, hopefully again with my yelp posse or if that doesn't happen I'll just have to try everything on the menu.",

Red Dragon (eel) Nigiri Sushi: squid, salmon, tuna & Spicy Teriyaki Chicken  Service was pleasant, everyone was nice and polite. However the food was mediocre, at best. I was sooo disappointed because I had such high hopes-I mean have you ever seen this many damn reviews?!   No but seriously, the Lime Roll had pieces of lime that overpowered the overall taste of the roll, the \"spicy\" teriyaki chicken was super salty and not spicy what so ever. The Red Dragon isn't even worth mentioning.   Again, staff is really nice, love the set up and ambience of the place-but the food is just not worth the wait (or the money for that matter).",

I ordered the first three nigiri selections and then he made some recommendations from there.  Throughout my dinner, he was very helpful and very pleasant!  Here's a list of what I had.  All are nigiri except where noted:  Garlic tuna Hamachi Octopus Conch Cajun tuna Masago jalapeno (forgot the quail egg, Paolo, but I'll remember next time. Crab (snow) meat Sweet shrimp  Salmon belly Spicy shrimp and Scallop yum yum hand rolls Cold tofu with 3 condiments Grilled salmon and grilled white tuna Green tea creme brulee Green tea cake Chocolate mousse Tempura ice cream  Chef Freda saw how much I enjoyed the grilled white tuna so he made me the sushi version of it nigiri style.  Service was great.  I felt very comfortable for my first time here, and I started to learn more about how to order and what to look for.  I also took his suggestions several times especially when he recommended the heads be removed from my sweet shrimp nigiri and then eaten in the soup they make.  The shrimp heads and soup were superb!",

I had to wave down a busser who I thought would get our waiter for us but ended up taking our order and it took 20 minutes for the items to come and missed one of our orders as well. The restaurant is small so that made me more irritated as to how does a waiter not come and do their job more often? Im just glad they didn't push the time limit disclaimer. Food was great, just step up the service please.",

And, yes, leaving behind the rice and eating the fish only, for a nigiri, does call for a penalty, as well. A bit subjective.. But, not being explicitly told about this before being served; not fair.  However, \"not charging us extra this time\" & being very nice -- well played!  Yellowtail and seared tuna nigiris, as well as the green tea and black bean ice cream are all a \"must try\"",

Try to call beforehand to get an idea of the wait. Don't waste prime real estate on salads, appetizers, etc and just go straight for the sushi. One of my faves is the Salmon Skin Hand Roll, yummy! They supposedly charge you for things you don't eat, but we haven't had that problem yet. Maybe because we clear our plates each time? Not good for groups due to the size of the tables and wait time.  Happy eating!",

    "text": "#500  Sushi House Goymon, you now have a new fan! And as a fan, you will have exponentially more fans than before because I will bring the whole family to your location when I'm in town.  Yes, the AYCE is worth the  $27 price for dinner if you come with a small group of people. If you like some food porn, here's what I have:  Appetizers:  Grilled Pork Belly-THE BEST DISH EVER! Had 3 of these. Does not taste fatty and cuts well with the mango salsa on the side. MUST ORDER <a href=\"http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/JyxHvtj-syke7m9rbza7mA?select=lTQxalGjZwKr0VnSkfrRwQ\">yelp.com/biz_photos/JyxH...</a>  Crispy rice roll-Their take on crispy rice, it was really good, and beautifully presented. Another must order <a href=\"http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/JyxHvtj-syke7m9rbza7mA?select=x5O0ULxFDk040VAb9X2aaw\">yelp.com/biz_photos/JyxH...</a>  Calamari-This wasn't fried like the description but it wasn't bad, and it was cut lengthwise.  <a href=\"http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/JyxHvtj-syke7m9rbza7mA?select=--fCRONuWZfZkssUt8tHUQ\">yelp.com/biz_photos/JyxH...</a>  Poke Salad-Believe it or not, it tasted like it was from Hawaii. Has seaweed, onion, sesame oil dressing. I didn't taste octopus but it was tons of tuna. Must order!  <a href=\"http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/JyxHvtj-syke7m9rbza7mA?select=8L323NocS5iV6fmWeXAhpQ\">yelp.com/biz_photos/JyxH...</a>  Sashimi Salad-You would think it's the leftover pieces from the nigiri but the cuts are pretty uniform. Has a mayo dressing up top.  <a href=\"http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/JyxHvtj-syke7m9rbza7mA?select=4yBbz74kdM3xZaLR9UUlQw\">yelp.com/biz_photos/JyxH...</a>  Cold Tufu Dish-Sorry about this pic, I was a bit hungry but I just wanted to let you know that the 3 little dabs of sauces that it came with was a great idea. One of them was more salty than what I can remember.  <a href=\"http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/JyxHvtj-syke7m9rbza7mA?select=jc02eyA7u0K74XnnFuwnbg\">yelp.com/biz_photos/JyxH...</a>  Yellowtail Jalapeno-Interesting dish, still a subtle dish but with only a slight kick. Its grilled with ponzu sauce.  Not dried, very good!  <a href=\"http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/JyxHvtj-syke7m9rbza7mA?select=uNgiZD1JaAIAL5MTEOSxYg\">yelp.com/biz_photos/JyxH...</a>  Super White Tuna-Just awesome!  Melts in your mouth. MUST ORDER! Cajun Albacore-Too spicy for me, could not taste the fish <a href=\"http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/JyxHvtj-syke7m9rbza7mA?select=yj63bUNxtZy-riRqsB4Lag\">yelp.com/biz_photos/JyxH...</a>  Anago-One of the best dishes, you must order!  MUST ORDER. I had 4 of these!  <a href=\"http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/JyxHvtj-syke7m9rbza7mA?select=ZvJU_hc6FgA960b21mW1Ug\">yelp.com/biz_photos/JyxH...</a>  Surf Clam (Hokki)-Actually I did not try this, but my friend said it was good <a href=\"http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/JyxHvtj-syke7m9rbza7mA?select=WzJGu_cJgrXNUqcIzXw1rQ\">yelp.com/biz_photos/JyxH...</a>  Salmon-Above average, I actually prefer the cut a little thicker Cajun Albacore-Too spicy for me, could not taste the fish  Smelt Egg(masago) and Tuna -Good stuff! Pretty average and must order item for me.  <a href=\"http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/JyxHvtj-syke7m9rbza7mA?select=K-ffVH17eTune_kQqndQ4Q\">yelp.com/biz_photos/JyxH...</a> Crab Meat-Tasted a bit salty and a bit frozeny. Hmm....but hey, at least they use real crab!  <a href=\"http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/JyxHvtj-syke7m9rbza7mA?select=JIAR99_4omjG3DjX4h06Jg\">yelp.com/biz_photos/JyxH...</a>  Uni and Amaebi -A little watery, but it was good.  Not a must order for me but the shrimp fried heads were terrific!  <a href=\"http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/JyxHvtj-syke7m9rbza7mA?select=dcoARVKVc6DZlAVFzlugEQ\">yelp.com/biz_photos/JyxH...</a>  Rolls:  I only ordered the spider roll (5 pcs). This was not one of the rolls that can be ordered as a half roll. It was quite big, had softshell crab, cucumber, avocado, crab meat, wrapped in soy paper with eel sauce. It was more rice than I can handle, but I did eat it all.  <a href=\"http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/JyxHvtj-syke7m9rbza7mA?select=7ha5VosAQcHALqWDlSvVlg\">yelp.com/biz_photos/JyxH...</a>  Dessert:  Lychee Ice Cream- creamy , flavorful, I had 2 of these, need I say more? MUST ORDER <a href=\"http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/JyxHvtj-syke7m9rbza7mA?select=CO8qwkgVL3AboRK5rhe78w\">yelp.com/biz_photos/JyxH...</a>  Green Tea Creme Brulee - Awesome, matcha flavored. Can eat this all day, but couldn't because I stuffed my face with Nigiri earlier. MUST ORDER <a href=\"http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/JyxHvtj-syke7m9rbza7mA?select=bcpqqrtKBhzJGWZOeeY0SA\">yelp.com/biz_photos/JyxH...</a>  Green Tea Cake -The worst item in the restaurant, but I'm glad it was this item not the sushi or other entrees.  DO NOT ORDER~!  :-O <a href=\"http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/JyxHvtj-syke7m9rbza7mA?select=RSqgc5TkyxKKTUK_jg3f2w\">yelp.com/biz_photos/JyxH...</a>  All and all one of the best meals I've had in 2012. Oh, I know what you're saying, it's only January? I can honestly say that this place does deliver on quality and presentation. I have been to other places where the food does not come out as fast , nor as pretty, or as hot.  Thank you again, and I will come back and contribute to the wait time.",

For a small place that can only sit 60 people, they have many chefs. The food comes put fast after ordering. They won't give you stuff you didn't order.  Lunch is $22 and dinner is $27. It is about same price as elsewhere in town.   The sushi was great and they have everything you crave for in sushi. They dont skimp on the fish and make the rice bigger than it needs to.   I had been to many sushi buffets, this is one of the best. And yes, this place totally beats Sakana sushi in terms of decor, food quality and service.",

A wide variety of rolls makes for some very interesting and intriguing options. You have to go with the all-you-can-eat deal as well. For $28, you can go to town on anything they have on the menu, which includes appetizers, nigiri, and rolls. Sometime the place is really packed and since its kinda small, you have to wait for a while, but it is definitely worth it. The location is kind of hidden on the end of a strip-mall, but there is plenty of parking available. I have eaten here many times and its great every time. Plus they have a loyalty card program as well after 10 times dining in you get a free meal. Definitely one of my favorite sushi places in Vegas.",

And I also ordered some yuzu tobiko, Kobe beef, ramen and a couple of other things I can't remember. Everything was superb as if it wasn't all you can eat quality. The creme brulee was delicious!!

Anyway, Goyemon, is Sushi Mon on steroids. They have the same rolls/dishes/nigiri, etc. but with several added new dishes, more individual sushi bar space and it definitely hits the late night spot especially since they don't close until 3am. Generally my visits go like this:  Pork Belly with a little mango salsa on the side you say? Mmm yes please. I'll take 10 more plates. More Cajun albacore rolls...Um of course. Oh and what is this?

I like to order the uni, ama ebi (sweet shrimp), snapper, and halibut sushi. Also on the menu is the grilled yellow tail collar. Add a squeeze of lemon and voila it's ready for my taste buds. There is also a plethora of specialty sushi rolls on their menu with cool and funky names.  The appetizers and desserts are also included in the all you can eat option so I have to have the deep fried oysters (which are always fresh and deep fried to perfection), seaweed salad, and edamame.  As for the desserts they are all pretty good. Not being a sweet tooth I have to say the dessert options were better than I expected and not too sweet either.",

    "text": "I normally don't hand out 4 star reviews for Sushi in Vegas, but this place deserves it and here's why. 1. price was great, $26 for all you can eat including Uni and sweet shrimp is truly a bargain. Also compared to the costly Casino options this is a great deal. The service was very friendly and was a big help in offering options. The food was very good and why all the rolls weren't the best the majority of them were very good. If I had to rate the food it would be a 3.5 but the extras raise this up to a 4. Fish was fresh and they had a nice selection of Sake. We did have to wait an hour because it is a small place but it was worth the wait. I would suggest getting there early as all you can eaters can take up some time at the table. Also a short ride from the strip it makes it worth it. Looking forward to coming back.  FYI- there's a great liquor store a few stores down in case your waiting. He has a nice selection of beers and we started with Sapporo.",

    "text": "All-You-Can-Eat sushi in Los Angeles is, in my experience, more miss than hit. Well, this place in West Las Vegas hits it out of the park, on the first try. Really though, I do not see how any place in this catagory OR price range (Dinner, all you can eat, is $26.95) can offer such a diverse selecton of FRESH food, period. EVERYTHING here was very high quality, and stood up to the most expensive and the freshest selections I have had at so many, many other \"high end\" sushi restaurants. The Latino guy behind the sushi bar did not stop smiling and offering me tidbits and Ohhh Sooo Good morsels of anything and everything --\"Hey Sir, how you doing here, I have a small piece of Yellowtail Belly, wanna try some?, and 'Hey, you like Pork Belly too?'.... it was non stop like that. Perfect Yellowtail, a nice dollop of Uni (only one order per person on the AYCE Menu, and I thought that was fair), Salmon Belly, Escarole (White Tuna, oh yeah they got 'em), FRESH Albacore.... I looked up a few times and met the eyes of the aforementioned Latino guy, and got more smiles, and more offers, until I started tugging on my belt and lamenting my recent small weight loss was just that, lost -- but wait, there's more! The small deserts are to die for. Whoever heard of Green Tea Brulee...?? Not me till now, and I had 2, thank you very much. :) The Chocolate Mousse, and the Lemon Sorbet were a tiny touch from God himself, really I mean it. This place gets my business every time I'm in Vegas, for fun or work, and I don't mind telling everybody, even though it might cause an extra 15 minutes of wait time. It is very well worth it. Plus, they close at 3AM, I believe. 5 Stars, 10 if I could give them that. Go try, be happy, leave full.",

My one and only gripe was the fact that we were told that there was 15 minute wait--yay. Unfortunately, it was closer to 45. I expected a wait but was disappointed that the estimate was so far off. Oh, well. We were seated at the bar which turned out to be amazing. I finally got to try uni (yum)! The sushi chefs were all extremely helpful and funny. They were super quick to make suggestions without being pushy. I think sitting at the bar helped for faster \"refills\". We had several half rolls which were all delicious! We tried the pork belly and LOVED it...we had at least 4 orders. The freshness of all the sushi was outstanding. I'm a little afraid that this place will ruin all our local joints for me but we will definitely be back on our next trip!  Oh, and we were stuffed for hours afterwards so we might need to work on our timing... Either way, it was SO worth it!",

My boyfriend and I were happy to see that you can order the salmon belly as much as you want and same goes for most of the desserts on the specials. I also tried the grilled shishito pepper which was simple but delicious. Our go to rolls are usually the hurricane, the moon, the ecstasy, the jala jala, and the crispy rice roll. Try at least one of these rolls and I promise you won't be disappointed. Their nigiri is also very fresh and cut well, but I do feel like they could use less rice. Hands down, this place has the best dessert compared to all sushi spots I've been to in Vegas and I have been to quite a lot. I ordered eight desserts for my boyfriend and I but ended up eating most of it. I am a total fat girl trapped in a petite asian girl's body. I got the green tea creme brulee, two orders of sesame mochi, green tea mochi, two orders of tempura ice cream, lychee sherbet, and green tea ice cream. I do wish they would put more sugar on top of the creme brulee so it could have the thick, crispy layer of torched sugar that I'm used to. Other than that, you must try it. The tempura ice cream was alright, but I wish I would have ordered like 10 sesame mochi's because it was that damn good lol. They also have a yuzu sherbet that is one of my favorites from here but they ran out before I could get to it. This place is awesome. Give them a try if you haven't yet!",

In fact, I might go so far as to say that its the best AYCE joint in the world and the fact that its located in Vegas only adds to the magic.    For $26.95 you can get some of the best sushi available in good ole Las Vegas, plus unlimited appetizers, daily specials and wait for it...DESSERT!  Trust me you won't want to skip dessert because they have an amazing green tea creme brulee and s super sweet selection of mochi ice cream.   My only recommendation would be to get in early and to sit at the bar so that you have your chef's full attention.  The rest will take care of itself because Goyemon does it right from start to finish.  DEFINITE MUST EAT!!!",

I have been to many sushi bars in the vegas area and a could not find one that compares to the quality of fish and service. I would recommend sitting at the bar, especially if the head chef, HIEU, is working!! Hieu concocted a pickled wasabi and suggested that I only use it on \"fatty\" fish, but I didn't listen and used it on EVERYTHING and even took my friends' pickled wasabi (sorry, not sorry). I loved all the specials that day from the Aji, Blue Fin, Aori Ika, Toro (1 order per person), SALMON BELLY and so much more!!! I dont think I can ever eat normal salmon ever again... Hieu even created some amazing off the menu/specials for us... then he put it on the menu 10 seconds later so we had the VIP experience for 10sec (better than nothing)... All of the sushi chefs were awesome and gave good vibes and made the experience that much better. If you ever find yourself going to goyemon, sit at the bar and order all of the specials. You will not be disappointed!! Hope this help :)",

I couldn't believe that those horribly made nigiris were served at a place specializing in sushi. Half (maybe 1/3) of the sushi size it used to offer; fish was not fresh at all (i was really scared I'd get sick after eating).

I was in the mood for AYCE and was in the neighborhood, so I thought I'd try it again. $26.95 for AYCE with a nice sized menu.   I got a few orders of Nigiri: cajun albacore, garlic tuna, seared tuna, and super white tuna. All were cut nicely and tasted fresh. I got a few orders of baked mussels and a tuna poki salad. Both of which were great.  Probably my favorite thing about Goyemon is they allow AYCE patrons to order half rolls, score! I ordered a half ecstasy, a half pastel and a half calico along with a pixie roll.   The pixie roll was my least favorite, it was wrapped in soy paper and the seaweed paper, but the seaweed was too chewy, I had trouble breaking it up. It wasn't like that on the other rolls however.   My favorite was the ecstasy roll, I ended up ordering another half of that. Then of course tempura ice cream for dessert.  I should note that I wasn't alone, so don't go thinking I put all that away on my own :)  I gave it 4 stars due to the space alone, really crowded and it feels like your on top of the tables around you, not for the food. Overall this time the food and the service was great, I will be making many return visits.",

There is so much variety with the rolls from chicken, beef, and to fish. Plus if they recognize you they're usually accommodating to whatever kind of roll you can dream up.

You have to grab their attentions.  And I agree with someone said the chef is kinda rude too.  My friend and I wanted to sushi bar and it was wide open but the chef got angry with us because we didn't sit right next to the customers he already had at the sushi bar.  I would understand it if it was busy but no.  There are so many AYCE places in Las Vegas and I have no doubt that there are better sushi places out there.",

This was the first place I actually waited an hour to eat. Sounds stuck up, but I don't typically like to wait, but I thought hey, all the good places should have a wait right? Wrong. I was really underwhelmed by this place. I felt kinda bad because I went with my boyfriend's family and I chose this place and we had to wait and then weren't impressed at all.  The sushi was typical. They didn't offer anything different or new. The only compliment I can think to give is, I believe it was the cajun albacore? That was really good here, probably the best I've had. Also, the rice to fish ratio was nice. It wasn't loaded with rice. Other than that, this place was meh :/. I probably won't be back.",

I'm sorry but if you go to a restaurant and they don't have staple items in the menu ( on AYCE)  At least give me a discount or a rain check for free desert when u do have it !  Or at least tell me when I sit down to order, don't pull the bait & switch bull crap. This is a restaurant not a car dealership !!!  Simple business practice!

Of course we ordered the AYCE. Loved the fact we can order 1/2 rolls so we could try lots of different items. The nigiri was the perfect bite size. We enjoyed the Hurricane, garlic tuna, masago with quail egg, and I also tried the 911...spicy habanero HELL! We made friends with nearby patrons & started sharing but none of them dared to try the 911. I couldn't feel my face after eating it, thank goodness for the nearby sugar packets to help put out the heat. To finish our meal, lychee sherbet...refreshing and light. Definitely at the top of our list for sushi.",

    "text": "I was going through and cleaning up my bookmarks when I came across another review I somehow missed. *Gasp* For Goyemon of all places!  You can probably already guess that I love this place. Vegas has a sea of sushi spots, so I imagine it's hard to stand out and really impress. Somehow, Goyemon manages to do so. It's hard to explain, but I think it's just the intangibles that put Goyemon in a special place in my sushi-loving heart.  OK so the truth is that I've only been here twice. But both times were with a large group of fantastic friends. So maybe that has something to do with it. Both times were in the private room off to the side and we had reservations, so I've never had to wait for a table. And most importantly, both times, the sushi was top notch.  My favorite memory of this place was when my cousin and I decided to order every single nigiri item on their AYCE menu. Yep. We simply told the server, \"1 through 27.\" Doesn't get any easier than that! They brought out our nigiri in batches of 9 pairs. It was like nigiri heaven. Probably the only negative I can even think of is that they don't have tobiko. I need my tobiko with quail egg! Oh well. Masago with quail egg works too.  Goyemon also has a good selection of non-sushi items. Did someone say pork belly? Don't mind if I do. And their dessert. Maybe I should have started the review with dessert. Hands down, Goyemon has the best selection of any AYCE in town--lychee sorbet, plum wine jelly, tempura ice cream, and much more. And you can have as much as you want! That's certifiably insane.",

    "text": "Being a SF Bay Area kid that also spent a few years on the coast south of Santa Cruz, I may be a bit spoiled when it comes to sushi. I mean, sometimes I'm just plain hungry and grab a platter of sushi from Trader Joes but I know what I'm getting for the price I'm paying. Now, this being Vegas and it being an AYCE place, I wasn't expecting superb and super fresh stuff. I was pretty sure I would've been better off ordering rolls but I had been watching an old Japanese drama of mine that focuses on nigiri so it's what I was craving. Anyhow, my impressions were...  [--- Pros ---] - Pretty nice to have a sushi place only a short walk from my place - Pretty good price for AYCE (We went for lunch) - LOVE that the AYCE isn't limited to sushi but includes appetizers & desserts. - Baked mussels were pretty awesome. - Lychee sorbet with little lychee bits. Yep, my mouth went to there. - Miso wasn't overly salty which sadly so many places get wrong. - Tamagoyaki was a bit on the sweet side, which I love as I consider it to be my 'dessert' sushi. =) - Enjoyed the seared sake/salmon enough. - Food came pretty quick and servers were generally attentive. - Definitely ordered enough to justify the $22.  [---Cons---] - Nigiri serving size. Now, as it is AYCE, I can kinda let this go as I'm sure they're just trying to make sure people are/can finish what they order, especially when it comes to the sushi but the nigiri were pretty itty bitty. Again, I probably should've gone with rolls over nigiri.  - But even the appetizers came in pair servings. The baked mussels I can forgive but tempura? Gyoza? Eh...can throw me 3-4 pieces at least, especially for the actual size of them. - No inarizushi? =/ Isn't that a standard for a sushi place? And it's tofu pouches so it's not overly expensive to make so I don't know why they don't have it... - Also, futomaki is a 'special' 5 piece only roll? I would think it's more of a standard than a California roll, which is under 'Regular'. Sadly, by the time I noticed it, I was already pretty full. Oh well, next time. - Teriyaki sauce on unagi? Tsk tsk... Unagi = unaju  All in all, it's decent place to fill your belly on the cheap but I wouldn't recommend it for their nigiri unless its the tamagoyaki, then go wild! Definitely order some appetizers along with your sushi to get your monies worth in more protein than rice. Again, the mussels were delish. And save room for dessert. When I go back, definitely gonna try out the rolls... I figure that it's at least a step up from the sushi that's served at the buffets that's just sitting out there for who knows how long.",

    "text": "This place would easily have earned four stars if not for their lack in service.  It's surprising how small this place is for AYCE.  We arrived around 5:30pm, expecting to have to wait at least an hour for my party of eight.  The wait was as expected, but what killed me was that we were placed in this little \"secret\" room off to the side - a room that had been closed off and EMPTY since I first arrived!  Um, why weren't we just seated here to begin with instead of having to wait?  As we prepared to sit, two friends called to let us know they'd be joining as well.  I let the hostess know, apologized for the change, and said that we totally didn't mind squeezing in together.  The table had plenty of space, and all we needed was two chairs and place settings.  That's when our main waitress started to get snippy.  She was short when answering questions and had an air of attitude about her to a point where my friends and I found ourselves staring at each other in awkward silence on more than one occasion.  Thanks for a lovely meal (yes, you can sense the sarcasm).  Lastly, I didn't learn until after we had left that Sushi House offers a loyalty program - one stamp for every visit, and ten stamps to earn on free AYCE meal.  They probably didn't even offer me one on purpose, since I'd have earned my free meal during that visit.  Shady.  Food, and the variety if it, was fine, but if I were to return, I'll come back with a much smaller group.  Hopefully service would be better then.",

Everything is fresh and so finger licking good (yes, put down your chopsticks and eat with your fingers). Love their \"melt in your mouth\" white tuna sushi, salmon and yellow tail kama, always always order the pork belly and oh the desserts are just so om nom. Chocolate mousse , vanilla mochi, green tea creme brulee, delicieuses, keep it coming !!!  Seat at the table or at the sushi bar, either way you'll get a great service. If anything, the amount of time waiting for seats to open up could be quite long since it always so crowded for dinner but then again it is worth it.",

I tried so many different rolls, I won't bother to even list them.  The dessert was on point (strawberry Mochi, lychee sherbet, and the creme brulee).  Service wasn't super friendly, but they showed up frequently and kept the dishes coming out fast and in this case, that was all I really needed.  The value is there, the food quality is there, the selection is there, not sure what else you really want for an AYCE sushi buffet.  Maybe I'm easy to please when it comes to ayce sushi, but I was a happy camper.  Give them a try.",

Waiting for a table, no problem. But being seated and waiting almost 40mins for our first roll to come out...horrible!  Will never ever be back.

Sushi rice was cooked with less water and rice vinegar which made sushi taste worse. The most of fish we ordered weren't fresh. Fresh scallop we ordered had too much lemon taste and I believe the chef try to cover the dated fish smell by squeezing lots of lemon. Albacore we ordered had faded color. Little Tokyo roll had absolutely no flavor which my wife and I just had one bite and left them all there. Server was very unprofessional and rude. She kept complaining about us leaving he rice even though we told her about the problem of rice. We had to just walk out from the restaurant. Stay away from this place.",

It was a busy night, and expect a tight squeezed restaurant. Not that it was a bad thing or anything.. Overall the food was great and came out FAST ! We sat at the sushi bar, so our sushi man was taking our sushi orders and they came out faster than I thought. The only reason why I didn't give this restaurant 5 stars because some of our side orders didn't come out until later. I'm assuming they had forgot about it. For example when we pretty much finished all of our food, they brought out the steam dumplings but the steam dumplings were room temp to cold already.. ):  NOTE: If you are doing the all you can eat, they will not give you a bill until everything is finished off your plate. At least that's what happened to me when I asked for my bill when we were almost done eating. We sat in the corner of the restaurant and our servers didn't check up on us too much so I didn't feel like waiting on them for the bill. (Hence why I asked for the bill.)",

They put some fresh lemon juice on top which is a great compliment to the scallop. Make sure you check out their blackboard for their specials. Sometimes you'll catch some bluefin tuna on their specials. My favorite is when they have salmon belly. One of my favorite cuts of fish. Another great thing about this place is that they let you order half rolls. Gives you a chance to try lots of different rolls.   This place does get busy. So expect a wait during prime times. They do open late. Until 3AM. I usually try to come during the off hours. Never a wait and you get your food fast. I try to sit at the sushi whenever I can. The sushi chefs are great and friendly. Also the fastest way to get your food because you can order right there with the chef.",

The staff went above and beyond our expectations as they caught the fish and prepared them all on the spot! They even milked the salmon for the eggs. They took time to grow, harvest,  skin, and slice the ginger to perfection, which is also why it took 30 minutes to get a small side of ginger. FYI, I did some research and did you know that ginger takes 8-10 months to grow! We got it in 30 minutes! AMAZING!  The staff was so great that they saved the best for last. After we got our dessert and the check, they brought out the unagi. They already took away our chopsticks and plates, so we had to eat our unagi with our dessert spoons. It's a bit unconventional, but very creative.  We expected a normal, 1 hour dinner. But instead, they took the extra time to make sure we received the full blown 8-course meal style, 5-star, dining experience for 2 hours. We were impressed with their unforgettable service!",

There were only six tables seated that night, and it took roughly 25-35 minutes for our server to help us.

They also have other options for those people in your party that are not into raw fish. That's what's nice about the place. It's just very versatile in what they offer their customers. Most sushi houses serve the same items, what makes a sushi place something I keep returning to is he service. The staff was very attentive and coordinated as a team.  They were able to get the rolls out at a reasonable time.  Overall, if you're near this place and crave sushi. You should stop by.",

This is the second time we left this place because of their bad service and we won't be back.   It's sad to see this place go down, it used to be good back in the day.   We ended up going to Sushi 21, right on the corner. Got there;  we're greeted by everyone; we ordered and I went to wash my hands. 3 minutes later, when I came back, the first roll was already at the table. Service keeps customers.   Bye Goyemon.",

    "text": "The dining experience here is okay, but could be better. Firstly, after being seated our order was taken as per usual in an all you can eat sushi restaurant. The first thing that was noted was how long it took for our orders to come out. I understand that sushi is something that shouldn't be rushed, but I think the service here is somewhat slower than other competing sushi restaurants! The rolls and nigiri itself were good, I appreciated the bigger piece of fish to rice ratio. Also, the first thing we ordered was miso soup and it got missed in our order, so we had to remind the waiter of our soup not coming out.   I wasn't able to get a picture, but my boyfriend had some ikura, which I'm pretty sure was spoiled because he said that it tasted very fermented as well as it looked foggier than usual. Kind of unsettling with the quality.   Lastly, I'm huge on making sure water is refilled, and they didn't come by once during our entire meal to fill up our water. In the grand scheme of things, I don't mind asking for water if I need to, but it's nice when I don't have to!   Overall, dinner here was alright. Nothing out of the ordinary, so if you're in the area and wanting sushi, it's good for the stop. But if you're looking for somewhere to take your family or for a more satisfying experience, I would consider driving somewhere else.   BUT if you do come here, get the lychee sorbet for desert. You don't find this at a lot of sushi restaurants, it was delicious!",

    "text": "Compared to other AYCE this is one of the better ones.  The fish was all fresh, they were heavy on the rice which is expected, but most of their rolls could be ordered half rolls which was great.  In order to be seated your whole party has to be here so don't make that mistake.  Even coming on a Wednesday night, around 7pm there was a slight wait.  We didn't have any problems finding a waiter/waitress to take our order and they were extremely efficient and nice taking our order, picking up plates etc.  What was not efficient was 2 sushi chefs on a busy night.  We couldn't tell if it was strategy or not but it did take awhile to get some orders.  One of my favorite things about this place was the fact that you can busy fresh wasabi.  It's always a game changer if you ask me.  Good spot, good sushi, come when it's not as busy.",

If you come during peak hours or on the weekend, expect to wait a little bit since this place is pretty well known. The orders of sushi come out very quickly and you usually don't have to wait longer than a couple minutes to re-order.  The food itself is high quality. Last time I went was two days ago, and the fish to rice ratio was great. They don't stuff big balls of rice in their nigiri like many other places do. Personally, my favorite things to order are salmon nigiri and unagi nigiri. My friends also like the super white tuna and the seared salmon nigiri. The appetizers here are also very good. I love the garlic edamame, fried calamari, and shrimp tempura. Last but not least, this place has unlimited dessert!! The fried ice cream is my choice but the matcha green tea ice cream is also great.  Overall, I love coming to Goyemon. Their food and service keeps me coming back and I can't wait to eat here again",

A friend made a recent visit and cited that our favorite sushi place has made a complete turnaround. The new staff is noticeably better and attuned with their patron's needs and requests. But the biggest surprise is the quality of the sushi. We now get big slices of the fish, even the yellow tail roll has visible chunks of the fish making up most of the roll unlike before where you'd need to wade through a lot of sushi rice. Nice job Goyemon, you won our hearts (and stomachs) back!",

Be aware that if you come during peak dinner hours the wait time will be around 30 min. They take your number down and they text or call you when they are ready for you. The service is quick and the food is so fresh.  They also have a nice specials board that changes often and it gives you the chance to try different things you may have never tried. I tried sea cucumber for the first time here. Our absolute favorite is the uni (sea urchin) and the amaebi (sweet shrimp). It's so delicious here it's just a bummer you can only get one order of it with all you can eat, but totally understandable since it would probably be gone after my girlfriend and I came in.  Everything is reasonably priced and the atmosphere is very casual with dim lighting so it would be pleasant for a nice date. One thing that Goyemon stands out over any other sushi is that it stays open till 3 am. If that doesn't say Las Vegas then I don't know what does.   The service for all you can eat sushi is never bad. We aren't paying for a fine dining experience. They just come by take your order and the food is brought out shortly after. You can't complain.  One of the best All you can eat sushi spots in Las Vegas.",

If you go for dinner, you get some deluxe items too like the pork belly (it is so good, it melts in your mouth!)  When I go, I like to sit at the sushi bar so you get faster service from the sushi chefs. There were two when we arrived and one helped us the entire night, the other one didn't say a word to us, or any other customer for that matter, even though he was standing directly in front of us at the sushi bar. It felt like he didn't want to be there, or was not the nicest person. We heard him make some inappropriate comments to another worker under his breath, but only we could hear since we were so close.  The sushi was all delicious, my favorite rolls are the Sexy Girl and Hurricane - I could eat those over and over again. For the appetizers, the tempura is well made, the calamari is good (in strips) and the dynamite is dynamite!  I know there are a bunch of AYCE sushi places in Vegas but out of the handful that I've tried, nothing's been able to top Goyemon, especially for the price.",

But you know what they say, Las Vegas is like Hawaii's 9th Island so let's eat sushi in the desert. It's located in a small strip mall center and plenty of parking in front. The doors are blacked out so I didn't know what to expect. It's nice inside, clean, cold AC, and the staff was nice. The sushi bar seating was fun and the sushi chefs were hustling through rolls but they made them with perfection and not too spicy for my liking. I love an easy menu with photos so you know exactly what you're ordering. Everything looked so incredible and I didn't know where to start but the chefs were recommending between decisions. It wasn't too busy during my visit and it was just after lunch time. I hear they have all you can eat which is nice if you have more time than just a work break. The rolls were super fresh and melt in your mouth. I would go back to this place next visit.",

    "text": "@sushihouse_goyemon is a hitter when it comes to AYCE sushi in Las Vegas! It's located off the strip in a poorly lit plaza but worth the drive. There is typically a wait but it is also worth the wait.  Their AYCE menu includes about 20 types of Nigiri all super fresh, a large specialty roll selection which you can request to order half portions (enables you to try more without having to commit to big servings), so many side dish options such as my faves pork belly and crispy fried shrimp heads OH MM GEE the best thing on the menu (which they are quite smart to limit), they have daily specials such a toro and belly, and are open until late late.    Can't forget their ice cream for dessert!   It is a go to spot for my family who live in Vegas and definitely a must stop whenever I am in town! Its honestly the best quality and bang for your buck in terms of AYCE.",

    "text": "Looking for sushi? Looking for All You Can Eat (AYCE) sushi? Well you're in luck. Goyemon is a great choice. I used to hit up Yama Sushi on Flamingo which is also a good choice, but more often than not I'm on the West side of the strip having come back from climbing in Red Rock and Goyemon is right there. (Side Note: The Yama Sushi on the West side of the strip on Spring Mtn Road is the crappier Yama Sushi. I would avoid it especially considering all the other options around.)  First of all - Don't waste your hard earned babysitting money buying individual items or rolls a la carte. ALWAYS! ALWAYS get the AYCE option since you'll get way more food for the price you pay. Also if you're a real connoisseur it will go without saying that you completely avoid the rolls. No Caterpillar roll, no Volcano roll, no Ecstasy Roll, NO ROLLS!! They're just a waste of precious stomach space since although you think they're tasty, you're loading up on rice, overly sweet sauces, cream cheese, and mayonnaise. Cream cheese? Are you kidding me? No self respecting sushi fan eats any kind of sushi with cream cheese. If you do then obviously your parents didn't hug you enough while growing up.  Second of all - As with alot of these AYCE sushi places there are select items on the menu you can only order once per person per visit. The expensive stuff like Uni (sea Urchin). Goyemon is no different. Always order this stuff unless you don't like it in which case it's probably because your parents never gave you a birthday party while growing up. I'll admit that Yama has a lot more of these premium (you can only order once) items, but I feel their fish quality is a little lower than that of Goyemon. Goyemon has fish that tastes fresher and the amount of rice in their nigiri is less which is important because you want a more favorable fish to rice ratio when you're shoving countless pieces of nigiri down your pie hole. Also during AYCE, you'll get charged extra for wasting rice.  Third of all - Goyemon has a white board as well as a side wall menu that has a rotation of special items they happen to have or happens to be in season. Often these are also designated as premium (order once) items. During our last visit we were lucky enough to see that Toro (fatty tuna) was on the board. WTF?! We wasted no time and ordered that first. The Toro was so velvety delicious and was included in the AYCE price! Another time they had the YellowTail Kama (Yellow Tail collar) which is also super delicious. Yama Sushi does not have this rotating white board menu and the offerings are more set and static. This makes it so that customers have more incentive revisit Goyemon since the menu isn't exactly the same every time.  Fourth of all - Goyemon has a loyalty AYCE stamp card! Every time you visit and order AYCE you get a stamp. Everyone in your party orders AYCE? You get a stamp for each person. (see photos). After ten stamps your eleven AYCE is free! Boo-shaka-lacka!!!  So yeah I didn't bother posting a bunch of photos (except for the card) since the Yelp page already has enough. I'll definitely look to go back to Goyemon if I'm in the area and load up on fish, but NOT ROLLS! C'MON ROLLS?! We've been through this!! Remember paragraph 2?! NO ROLLS AT AYCE SUSHI PLACES!!!",

    "text": "All the sushi I can possibly eat, with a huge variety of rolls and even sides for just $25? Yes please! But a chef that rudely insults customers? Ehh...  My boyfriend had been to Goyemon before during a work trip, and after he told me about I made sure to tag along the next time with him and his cousin who also joined us for dinner. It was a bit of a wait to be seated but it wasn't too bad, and the hostess was very nice. We were seated at the bar which was great to have a sushi chef tending to us the entire time, though we still needed to order sides with the waitress, who unfortunately didn't stop by very often.   The chef who made sushi for us did make excellent food, but the only complaint I had, which is a big one, is he'd sometimes make very insulting jokes to us that were rather rude - my boyfriend's cousin wasn't hungry so she didn't order any food and just joined to keep us company and catch up, so when she kept looking at the menu without ordering anything the chef said \"we have a menu with pictures if that one's too difficult for you\". Also when my boyfriend was on his 8th roll, since he's a rather tall guy with a big appetite, the chef asked \"you know we have half rolls, right?\" Seems to me like implying a family member is too stupid to read a menu and making fun of my boyfriend for how much he eats is rather poor customer service. If Goyemon didn't have such wonderful food, it would've gotten a 1 star for sure.  But on the topic of the food, holy WOW! There's so many options for rolls, even someone who typically isn't into sushi could find something they like. I had two Philadelphia rolls, which is one of my favorites at most other sushi places, a Pastel roll, a JJ roll, and some fried calamari. The calamari itself was spectacular, huge pieces cooked perfectly so it wasn't too chewy, probably some of the best I've ever had.  There were some other rolls I was interested in and considered trying, but the chef probably would've made more derogatory comments or something which none of us had the patience for by then. If we do return - which is a very big \"if\", since there are plenty of other sushi options in Vegas where the staff don't insults guests - we will specifically ask not to be seated at the bar.",

    "text": "OMG I would leave 0 stars if I could. First time here and NEVER coming back. I'm really not the kinda person that complains about service cuz I'm usually content with whatever but this place really pissed me off. Came here with another couple, I ordered at least 10 things when we first sat down. It was almost an hour until we got 2 measly pieces of nigiri while the other couple's orders kept coming in. Half of our order didn't show up so I had to re-order twice for everything. And when the order did show up it was only 2-4 pieces (to share between the two of us!!) at a time so I never really felt satisfied. One of the servers did check in on us after we complained about our order not showing up and I do understand that they were busy.. But it took us THREE hours to get everything we ordered and between the two of us we ate maybe 15-20 orders of nigiri. That should not have took three hours!!! I also ordered a bigger bottle of sake to enjoy DURING my meal, but it took so long for the food to ever come out that we only finished half the bottle. For the perfect cherry on top this wonderful evening as I walked out the door the server said we couldn't take the bottle home. I've never yelled at somebody like that before but oh man on top of all the great service tonight something really cracked in me. NEVER EVER coming back here again!",

I generally like just sushi but they appeared to have a variety of rolls and a lot of california rolls for people who prefer to not eat the fish I enjoyed the Green Tea Creme Brulee and would get that again. I didn't catch our sushi chef's name but I would go back to him, he was quite but very attentive and quick. I didn't enjoy some of the loud and obnoxious patrons however that is not the fault of the restaurant.   Overall, if I was in the area I would go back.",

The service from the wait staff was decent, drinks were refilled without having to ask and the food from the kitchen came out in a timely manner. The baked mussels came with a sauce thats a little different from the typical spicy mayo thats at every other Sushi restaurant and the pork belly was good, but came out a little cold. The sushi chefs were on point, everything we ordered from them came out fast. We ordered almost all nigiri and they quality and cut of the fish was above average. We understood going in that this isnt going to be top notch sushi, not in the desert and not for under $30 AYCE so with expectations where they should be, we were very pleased with our experience at Goyemon and will return again.",

We ordered their yum yum scallops and fresh scallops three rounds. We had to bug the waitress a couple times, and the fresh scallop came out twice. In terms of the yum yum scallop, it never came out. The super white tuna never came out neither. Their cuts of the sushi seemed shorter and thinner compared to the last time we ate there. Will not go back!",

We are definately coming again.  Be sure to look on both sides of the menu.  There are many dishes so order half orders and if you find something that you really like then maybe order a full order.  They have your traditional nigiri sushi and many custom rolls.  Service is a little slow so order a couple of items.",

What I like about it is that if your at the bar, and you order a ton of food, the chefs are cool about it. I've been to other places in the Valley where they sort of give you weird looks like \"This guy isn't finished yet?..\" NO MF'er, I'm not, so give me some more damn food!!! haha. Seriously, The fish is so fresh here. I'm not usually a fan of rolls, but they make some bomb ones. The only complaint I can give is for the rice. While I've heard that sometimes it's hot, to be honest with you, even though I came for lunch and wouldn't have to worry having freshly made rice with my sushi, some of the sushi I received had a couple of slightly under cooked kernels of rice. (but not all of them, only a couple of pieces). And the wait staff was not around that much, but I can understand since they are so busy. That said, I would gladly come back and I enjoyed my experience here.",

Love the uni (so fresh) and lucked out since my companion wouldn't try it - no problem - more for me!  Everything else was great, just like my first visit.  Really enjoyed the green tea cake - not too sweet so it was the perfect end to the meal that left my tummy too full.",

    "text": "Wow wow wow definitely the best all you can eat Japanese place in Las Vegas.  I don't think it's even close.  According to our very nice and helpful sushi chef, this is owned by the same folks who own Monta Ramen.  And Monta Ramen is delicious.  In fact, you can order the same ramen after 11 pm.  Either a la carte or as part of the all you can eat deal.  Not sure I'd fill up on Ramen when getting AYCE but it's nice to have options.    Pork belly - Wow.  Just absolutely deliciously fatty, crispy, and delicious.  The edges just have that beautiful crispiness you get from cooking it just right.  The rest just melts in your mouth. Spicy tuna on a \"cracker\" - pretty awesome.  It was like toasted rice topped with spicy tuna and their sauce.  Delicious. Grilled veggies - 2 small tomatoes slightly charred and perfectly tangy and delicious.  Nice mushroom, asparagus, and sweet potato slices.  I'm on a low carb thing now and, had I not broken my diet by eating some sushi rolls, I probably would have eaten 4 of the veggie plates and 4 of the pork belly plates. Sushi rolls - don't remember all I had.  Spicy tuna was good.  California was just ok but better than you'll get at other AYCE places.  Yellowtail was good. Green Tea creme brulee - not too sweet and delicious.  Custard was nice and soft.  Sugar on top crispy and caramelized beautifully.  All in all - with the environment, great staff, and most importantly great food you will not regret coming here.  Just high quality for an AYCE place.  Get the pork belly!",

MARIA was taking care of the next table of 6ppl. she came between the table and was taking order from the big party. so she saw my bf raising his hand. so she said \"ill get your order\" and SHOOK HER HEAD when she said it, face expressions 'annoyed'.  what the hell? she can do that at the back but doing that shit in front was super rude. We both saw it and at first i thought i saw it wrong . but yes, my bf saw it too.  BOSS at Goyemon should read this.

The sushi chefs are friendly and engage in conversation if you're the type to chat it up. The fish here is quite fresh and the chefs don't give too much rice in the nigiri. The dessert selection is pretty good too. Ice Cream mochi, Lychee ice cream, tempura ice cream, and other desserts. When I came here 2 weeks ago they had a pumpkin mousse for fall season. I'll def. be coming here more often",

However, once inside you feel the energy and buzz of this place. We were fortunate to go on a Wednesday, and only waited a little while for places at the sushi bar. To begin with, Goyemon is one of the best sushi restaurants I have ever been too. Everything is five star.  And the best thing about it, they have an all you can eat deal for less than $30 per person. Our head sushi chef, Fredo, was an entertainer and perfectionist who entertained us while we dined on all his suggestions.  Normally, the quality of an all you can eat is questionable. Here, it is as fine as you can get and a bargain too. It is on the west side of town, a decent ride but well worth the trip.",

Love the fact that they're open 11:30am until 3am so anytime you're craving bomb-ass sushi and/or Japanese food in Vegas, come here. Every time I'm in LV I come to this place at least three times a week. The sushi has the freshest, finest fish and ingredients, the tempura and gyoza is fried in the cleanest oil, the edamame is perfectly salted and boiled, and the mochi ice cream is superb. The portions are small to ensure you don't over-do it, but you still can't help it since everything is soooo good! The waiters and waitresses share tables so sometimes there's a little confusion with constant ordering, but they still get it to you in a timely manner. Keep in mind that EVERYTHING is made to order so some things take a little longer than others, but so worth the wait. I recommend sitting at the sushi bar so you can tell the sushi chefs directly what you want.  They have about 35 specialty rolls and we've tried about 10 of them, but the JJ, Philly Roll and Sexy Girl are def faves of my husband and I. They have a frequent diners program card too but you have to ask for it - buy 10 AYCE meals and the 11th is free. My favorite restaurant in LV! I wish they had one in SF!!",

I've got 3 very bad experiences that i'd like to share and never again would i call to order for pick up nor dine here. 1) when i went with my husband's grandmother, waited for more than 2 hrs.! C'mon, she's very old and just wanted to eat some japanese food.. 2) went with my husband - not one worker asked us if we've been helped! We have to asked to be helped and told us to wait but several people behind us got to sit first before us!  What's up with that? Totally messed up!!  Oh, we're so pissed off!!   I'm Asian, and I'm not ugly... 3) just earlier, I wanted to order 1 sushi roll to go, the lady put me on hold for several minutes.  I was on hold for 15 minutes and she didn't bother to check if i'm still on the line or not..so I hung up after that and called back again..probably 25 times..just to check and see if she put back the receiver phone or how long she'll put me on hold if I didn't hung up..so, i keep calling. After 30 minutes of calling and calling, i finally got a ring and the lady again answered the phone. This time I asked their manager.  I told him what happened and how horrible their customer service is that they should do something about it. Though the manager apologized, it's still not good enough unless he give that worker a warning or better yet fire her. For those of you who love to eat japanese food just like me but would like to be treated fairly and just, please...please...please avoid this restaurant at all cost!!! The food is great but their customer service sucks so bad. I am never going back to this place ever again.. There are other japanese restaurants that are way better...

Anyway, it's not about the rule i'm complaining about but her god damn attitude and tone of voice. even the surrounding tables talked about her crappy attitude so i know we weren't thinking this in our heads...  then because of AYCE rule and the one hour limit, we decided to just order off the menu.we got the sush dinner for two, one fancy smancy role and an appetizer.  somewhere along the way, another meal got added to our table. when we questioned it, she said someone ordered a combo first time around then when she came back to take the rest of our orders, she assumed we still wanted the first order. assumed?!!? if you weren't sure, why didn't you ask? she was so unapologetic about it and basically said \"even if you don't eat it, you're still getting charge for it.\"   ruined our experience. definitely won't be back.",

They just seemed bothered, and as someone who also works in the industry it takes a LOT to get me to write a review. First things first, the roaches. No more than ten min of sitting at the sushi bar, a rather large roach runs across right where we are eating. I had to smash it with my napkin. When we told the waiter his response was a lackluster \"oh where'd it go?\" And that was it, I never even got another napkin. We stuck around, I'm no stranger to Vegas and one of its many inhabitants are roaches. So I get that sometimes they get inside. It was when we were almost done that we saw another roach, this time a little baby one. That was it, baby roaches mean many more somewhere else. Told the hostess and I was offered a stamp card?! As if I'd want to come back. Nobody even apologized and I still paid full price. Eat here at your own risk. I for one will never be back, and I'll be sure to tell all my friends who recommended this place.",

    "text": "This is a bit redundant but this is the Best AYCE Sushi restaurant in Las Vegas IMO. I can't remember everything I ate that night but we went through majority of the menu and the specials board and I was not disappointed at all. A few memorable standouts were the Yellowtail, Snapper, and Mackerel which found themselves repeated in every order. And of course the ever popular Pork Belly was very nice. I arrived too late and there was no more Hamachi Kama but just looking at that picture has me feenin to go back for it. There fish was of great quality. It was all so fresh tasting and there was no abuse of sauce. The sushi rice I could eat on its own. To me the rice is just as, if not a little more, important than what is on top and this place has nice rice. There was a nice attention to detail in the sushi which is not something I see at most AYCE places and even some regular sushi restaurants. Close your eyes, put your finger anywhere on the menu and anything you land on will be good.",

This place is awesome...my husband and I were visiting Vegas for work and wanted to eat some good sushi and based on the reviews here, we decided to check this place out...the service was amazing top notch.. Really. I never went to an all you can eat sushi and chefs and waitresses tell you to try everything and this and that... I first thought those items are extra charge since they were asking constantly. But, man this place is great... The fish, the dishes were fresh and tasty... Everyone was so friendly and fun.. Definitely coming back the next time...",

    "text": "Who says the best food in Vegas in ON the STRIP? Not me!  This place was the <a href=\"/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2Fbomb.com&s=bb4f996415a9c2f21137e27cfb68f439a48cec2652b53e9b50dd7e766dbe177e\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">bomb.com</a>! (not trademarked)  My fiance and I stayed at a timeshare directly next to a small shopping center off of Decatur Blvd.  Normally we would go towards the strip to eat at one of the many great places to eat, but we decided to eat nearby on Wednesday evening.  What a great choice that was.  Well, on to the food!  We walked in and were greeted immediately.  Smiles all around and were seated right away.  The hostess asked if we had been there before and we responded no, but we might be returning again in the future.  We sat down and were asked if we planned to order from the \"A la carte\" menu or just going to have the highly recommended \"All you can eat\" menu.  $26.95 for all you can eat?  Sure!  Why not?  We were pleasantly surprised to find out that it wasn't your typical pre-made rolls or crappy appetizers to choose from ... In fact, it was the whole freaking menu!  Everything we had wanted and more!  For $26.95?  Not too shabby!  Now, I am not typically a heavy eater, but when I am on vacation in Las Vegas, I am going to EAT!    We started by ordering some Salmon and Tuna sushi.  4 Pieces for each of us.  Had some calamari and some edamame to go with it.  The sushi pieces were pretty fresh considering we were in a desert.  The edemame, well it's edemame, you can't really screw it up right?  The calamari was pretty good, nothing to write home about, but I would (will) order it again.  Then we moved onto the rolls and ordered a salmon roll and a specialized roll that I requested.  They didn't have anything on the menu that had Avocado, Mango, and Tuna.  I wanted all of these things together and can normally find a roll with those contents in Orange County at just about any Sushi place.  They conjured it up for me with some mango salsa they had, sliced Avocado, and some good tuna.  The rolls were good in size and pretty flavorful.  This was the point where normally I would think about calling it a night ... but tonight was ALL YOU CAN EAT!    We moved on to the crazy good stuff.  Grilled pork belly with mango salsa?  Insanely good!  I normally stay away from pork, but the waiter insisted I tried it ... thank you Odin!  (The waiter was named Odin by the way)  And with the pork we had an order of the grilled veggies.  The veggies were amazing.  I don't know how much butter or what type of seasoning they added to these vegetables, but they were so good we immediately ordered another order.  It consisted of asparagus, mushrooms, and cherry tomatoes.  Just for good measure I ordered a few more pieces of sushi just to fill me to the brim.  Last but not least we ordered the desserts.  We had a green tea creme brulee (which was divine) and some green tea ice cream.  The desserts ended the meal perfectly.  All and all we probably ate about $80 worth of food for about $54.    I have to give a special shout out to Odin.  We had some complications with ordering drinks in the beginning and he was very accommodating and gave some great recommendations.  I left him a huge (well deserved) tip.  Next time we go back to Vegas, we will absolutely have to stop at Goyemon!  Enjoy!  -Steven",

    "text": "Ah, the infamous Sushi House Goyemon! Thank you Nelson Q. for convincing me to try this place. I've told myself I wouldn't eat sushi elsewhere since I am a huge fan of Sushi Mon. But somehow I found myself walking into unfamiliar territory on Sunday. My first thought walking towards the door was, \"damn this place has a butt load of people waiting outside.\" Translation: \" damn I have to wait a long ass time to eat.\" Fortunately, I was wrong. We were greeted by a nice hostess and were seated at the bar right away. The bar is pretty small compared to SM but I loved how spacious it was as far as food space go. As I looked around, I noticed that they offered more specials, but was disappointed to find out they didn't have toro!(nigiri) But no biggie, there were other great things to choose from.  The Rundown: Seared salmon/tuna- I love how they put less rice and more fish on these nigiris; fish was fresh, fat, and tasty!  Nigitoro- Honestly, not at all a big fan even though it was toro. The texture of scraped fish meat was too much for me.BUT the guy loved it. And was one of his favorites. Shrimp shumais- i had a party in my mouth. Gyoza- \"oh yah thats what's up,\" says the guy EeL- I had a fiesta in my mouth. Super white- It really was super(b) Spicy shrimp yum yum roll- it wasn't as yum yum as it should be. It was lacking a little bit of flavor..BUT it was real spicy and THATs how it should be.  Baked mussels- It was ok, not a big fan of it here. Green tea creme brulee- The guy really liked it, it was alright for me. Tofu cheesecake- for a TOFU cheesecake, it wasn't bad at all. Good job to whoever thought of creating this. Service- Uh I should've left more than the 21 percent because damn they're good. Hiro was real friendly and attentive.   So why the star deduction? Actually I gave them 4.5 . Minus half a star because one: they didn't have the yellowtail collar and it's one of my favorite dishes. Two: the only hand roll that I really love (shrimp yum yum) was lacking flavor. Three: even though nigitoro is still toro, I still wasn't a big fan of it. I was really looking forward to eating toro and was a wee disappointed that they didn't have it.  In the end, everyone was happy. Hiro(sushi chef) became our hero and once again, satisfaction kicked in. I'm also delighted to know that they don't limit the orders on the specials. Definitely will be coming back in the near future. Actually, already have plans to come in with some peeps this weekend. Oh yah!",

You might find yourself waiting as there usually is a wait due to its small size but totally worth it.

Yet, it was I who was mistaken because there were too many delicious things here that deserved a second trip. The service was impeccable and the food was delectable. I recommend the baked scallop (but dont eat all the cream cheese) and the hurricane rolls. The green tea creme brulee was nothing to write home about in my opinion. Also I had the sweet shrimp for the first time, didn't know it was going to be raw. It was delicious, once I got over the raw aspect. All in all a reasonably priced restaurant with an upscale taste.",

    "text": "Let me start out by saying that I'm an avid sushi eater and have been for quite some time and therefore have visited most AYCE places in town. We came here a few weeks ago and the service left much to be desired. After waiting 30 minutes for a server to take our drink orders at the bar, we finally got our food and it tasted average. Nothing to write home about.   Tonight, we got sat after a short wait (8pm), and once again waited 10-15 minutes for a waiter to come greet us. My girlfriend got the beef udon which comes with a California roll. With her being allergic to artificial crab, we asked them to remove the crab. The waitress informed us that this would result in a $2.50 charge. What??? Last time I checked, a what would be a cucumber roll costs less than a California roll, and especially the fact that a guest is allergic dictates that reasonable accommodations be made. Our waitress made a big fuss and finally I told her to grab the manager. She went and grabbed another server, who told us that there were no exceptions and they had to charge us more because they would have to use an extra strip of cucumber in lieu of the crab. Once again, what kind of drugs do you have to be high on to think that it makes sense to charge someone $2.50+$3.75 for a cucumber roll compared to a $4.25 California roll??   At this point he told me that this was by order of the chef so I asked to speak to him, and he told me that the chef was too busy and he can't pull him off the floor. Instead, he grabbed a business card and wanted me to email the owner. Last time I checked, when a guest is allergic you don't punish them and certainly don't insult them by refusing to amend the situation and defuse it professionally. Needless to say, we got up and went next door to sushi 21, which although smaller, has much better service. I'm glad that I put in a 15 nigiri order and they were already halfway done when when we left haha.  Ps. I've been a server for 8 years at 5 different restaurants and have never dealt with such a derelict managerial staff. It's beyond me how they still stay in business.",

You can also order any appetizers as well! We ordered many different rolls and nigiri and all was excellent. Our chef suggested many other things which we said yes too and most was good like the fresh scallops nigiri. The grilled calamari was so tough it was unedible...minus one star. Otherwise... it was a great meal without limitations on what you can order.. we will definitely go back.",

    "text": "FINALLY!!!!!!!!!!!!! got to try the mecca of AYCE sushi in Las Vegas!!!!!! I was actually somewhat worried about being let down by Goyemon because of all the hype but wow, was I wrong.  I went with my girl and we were seated at the sushi bar as soon as we walked in. I was really happy about this because all my friends told me to expect at least an half-hour wait. We ordered miso soup, shrimp tempura, and Sashimi salad as our side dishes and browsed through the menu. Miso soup is miso soup and shrimp tempura is shrimp tempura, but the Sashimi salad was delicious! We ordered following nigiri sushi: Tuna, Garlic Tuna, Albacore, Salmon, Halibut, Seared Tuna, Hamachi (Yellowtail), Ebi(Shrimp), Unagi(Eel), and Tamago(Eggs). They were hands down the best nigiri sushi I've tasted in my life! (besides the time I had sushi in Japan) All the fish were fresh and the portion of rice to fish was perfect! I was so stuffed after all the nigiri sushi that I only got to try one of their rolls, which was Hurricane roll. Hurricane roll had shrimp tempura and spicy tuna inside, topped with eel sauce and yum sauce. It was amazingly tasty to say the least! They have extraordinary desserts as well. We ordered Green Tea Creme Brulee and Lychee Sorbet. They were both excellent! I was really impressed with everything that still to this day, I can't get over it. Ever since I've had sushi at Goyemon, I've been daydreaming about going back and stuffing my face with their sushi.   Service was great! Sitting at the sushi bar, we had so much fun! The sushi chef in front us was constantly making jokes about how intimate me and my girl were and how I wasn't speaking loud enough when placing orders! Overall, this place is a great place to go for some great sushi and a great night!",

And did i mention dessert? you can get 1 of each! if you have room.... ranging from tempura ice cream, to lychee sorbet, to green tea creme brulee. The green tea creme brulee was AMAZING.   definitely worth the $$$; good service, and it's so nice and clean and decorated lovely. if there are some in your party who don't want to do AYCE, they have no problems accommodating. pretty fan-freaking-tastic.",

The uni, white tuna sushi and eel were my favorite.  They have alot of special rolls as well and I really liked the caterpillar roll and sunrise roll.  The only reason why I didn't give it 5 stars were that some of the special rolls came with alot of rice and they were just ok, I wish they also allowed you to order sashimi like some sushi places I've been to but it was still really good.  I would also recommend you order half rolls so you can try out items on the menu and definitely leave room for dessert because the mochi icecream and tempura icecream were awesome.",

I've tried the places up and down Las Vegas Blvd., the local spots in the Chinatown area, and I've even tried several places that non-Asians say are so amazing in Henderson.... GOYEMON IS THE NUMBER ONE SUSHI HOUSE, trust me on this. Well don't trust only me, trust the other 256 reviews that say something similar ;).   I wouldn't go with any other option than their generous all-you-can-eat specials, $27 per person for dinner, and this includes almost everything your sushi-loving heart desires. All sushi, specialty rolls, appetizers, salads, items from the daily specials board, samplings from the grill, vegetables, dessert, etc., etc., etc.!! The variety they offer is unbeatable, and the quality of the food is fantastic for the buck.   We've already been here a few times and we can NOT go without the salmon and unagi sushi, some shumai, the 9-1-1 roll (beware! it's hot even for a spice freak like me!), grilled calamari, pork belly, yellowtail from the grill, cajun salmon, grilled asparagus and mushrooms, garlic tuna sushi, and much more on top of that. I can honestly say their samplings of the pork belly may be some of the best I've ever had. Same goes for their mushrooms and grilled calamari.   $4.95 COCKTAILS!! I enjoy my AYCE meal with a SAKETINI for just under $5. Not common to be having a martini of all gin and sake for that low of a price!   mmMmmmMMMmm desserts. Just when you think you've had enough, don't leave without trying the green tea cake and the green tea creme brulee. They are simply fantastic.   The service is hit or miss. It's always at least decent, but sometimes it can be great because the server is willing to work with you and be more attentive to your needs. For example, last night, our server was friendly, informative, and lenient (he was not trying to force-feed our last 2 pieces of food because of the 'rules' of all-you-can-eat, though we did end up finishing them anyway), and although we were there for the last hour, he was patient and took our orders over and over again without hesitation. Even the food runner was able to take a few orders here and there. We never felt for a second that we waited too long, were being rushed, or that they were casually stalling (some AYCE sushi places definitely stall when approaching your table for reordering).   *** Expect to wait! I would avoid going during peak business hours. Go for early or late dinner, or even late-night because they are open until 3am and last order for AYCE is at 2am everyday! This place is quite the commodity and people will be waiting 1+ hour(s) to be seated whether you go on a weekday or weekend.  Don't forget to receive your special card that they stamp for every AYCE meal so you can eventually enjoy it all over again for FREE! My boyfriend and I already can't wait for that day to come :)",

Everything that he gave us was amazing and better than we could of ever expected. I know there are bad reviews but don't let that stop you for making a trip to see Hieu he will change your mind. As far a service goes these guys are tops. Oh and to make life easier I am a sushi snob and I am impressed which is hard to do. If you have any common sense in life and no restrictions let the chefs do the work they were trained to do. I will keep coming back just because the personalized service we received, the amazing sushi is a huge bonus.",

They offer a quality AYCE with a good price, offering a wide variety of\"appetizer\" options (including Takoyaki), though the Tempura was average and the Yakitori wasn't special. We enjoyed their Nigiri and all the rolls we tried, though I wish I remembered that I could get 1/2 orders on most of the rolls, letting us have a wider assortment. To finish we got Mochi (they all were good, but the Vanilla was excellent) and the Green Tea Ice Cream (Good, but outclassed by the Mochi). Remember they have a time limit (45 for Lunch, 60 for Dinner), so don't dawdle in ordering.",

It makes sense though because sushi is pretty expensive. They have a huge variety of choices, but the stand outs were definitely the white tuna and salmon sushi. However, they don't have sashimi (in the all you can eat menu) and you get full off of the rice with some of their special rolls, as they pack in the rice into some of them.  In any case, not a bad place at all. They only let you order the uni and the sweet shrimp sushi once because it's  pretty expensive, but that's ok because their other stuff is still pretty good =). Stay for the mochi ice cream and tempura ice cream. Both are delicious! =)",

We went there without a reservation and it was crowded. We ended up choosing to sit at the bar which turned out to be a lot more fun for us. The servers and the sushi chefs were very nice and accommodating. Because we were at the bar, there was very little wait time for our sushi and the waiter was prompt with our other side orders too. For an ALYCE sushi place, the quality was awesome. I personally really like their sushi nigiri some of the specialty rolls.  My favorites of the sushi nigiri was the salmon (which tasted immaculate to us), seared salmon, unagi, super white tuna, garlic tuna, and uni. For the specialty rolls the dragon, sexy girl, and maguma. The extra stuff from the menu we tried were the ahi poki, fried calamari, yakitori, and mochi ice cream. Their regular tuna nigiri was the only let down as two of the four pieces we had didn't taste as fresh as the rest of the sushi we had that night. Compared to other AYCE places in the area, this place is a good spot to try. We had a good time and would try them again when we're back in town.",

I was relieved because we were taking my bf's sister and I was worried if we go late that the service would be bad. Not the case here the restaurant runs great at all hours.   They offer ramen dishes after 11. If you have tried their Local Eats Award winning spot Monta (2nd restaurant ramen house) then you know the ramen is one of the best in Nevada.  Also most AUCE sushi spots do not have this wide of a selection with options like: Pork Belly, Teriyaki Chicken, and Sesame Chicken. :D  The miso is very authentic and you can get the shrimp head in.   ALSO: 911 roll is extremely spicy. If you like spicy try it! Get a large glass of water to go with it",

You know what they say.. if a place is packed with locals.. then it must be really good.  AYCE Sushi --could be a hit or miss.. but this place is for sure a real hit.  The place is Completely OFF the strip. Like..it's a $20 worth cab ride from the Trump..and a $15 worth cab ride back to the Excalibur...  So... if you have a car.. Definitely worth it to drive to this place for the cheap deal for AYCE but if you are...say two people sharing a cab.. then might as well splurge your money at the strip (not the taxi cab fare). get what am sayin?  Anyway... The fish is fresh.. all the rawness goodness is legit.  Loved the small tapas plates..  But i especially loved the hamachi and the salmon sashimi. the Salmon Belly was out of this world good as well.  Their special of the day was the Uni. Not sure i liked that.. it had an aftertaste that's not present in really good Unis i've had before...  We got our money's worth for everything.. including our cab fare.  Fast and Great service.

My friend put a little bit of rice on the side of her plate because it was too much, and the waitress came and told her she needs to eat the rice or she'd get charged which was ridiculous.

My first time trying the fresh scallop was here at Goyemon. The scallop was so breath-taking that it almost made me want to write a haiku. It was citrusy, fresh, and perfectly textured.   The non-ice cream desserts here are also arguably the most delicious compared to other sushi restaurants. At least try the creme brulee and chocolate pudding/souffle and you'll thank me later.  My not-so-favorite things here: the service, especially of the sushi chefs when sitting at the bar. If you're working for tips, you've got to earn them, people!",

    "text": "Since permanently moving here to Vegas a year ago, I have been here about 4 or 5 times. This has been the best AYCE sushi bar so far. I find the dinner service to be slight better than lunch.  The wait time for dinner can run you at least an hour although you may get called to a table earlier. They have a \"no-sharing\" policy that they enforce between the AYCE and Ala Carte menu and you have 45 minutes for AYCE. The food is fresh and great tasting all the time I've visited. The Pork Belly, which is served only during dinner hours, basically melts in your mouth.Yum. Mochi Ice Cream is always great at the end of your meal too. I bring all first time visitors to Vegas here when ever they want AYCE sushi. Its well worth the money.",

    "text": "This place went through so many changes and all for the worst. Their food is great but is gradually served smaller and thinner- but thicker layer of rice. It is a huge disadvantage with \"All you can eat\". There is no effort to serve a nice sushi roll as suppose to be and was before. The service is slow  and not even close to being the nice service as before. Except for one who has been there from the beginning almost, the entire staff of servers are unacknowledged with what's inside a roll and even worst- they roll their eyes at you if you want to change anything - even A La Carte dishes! Last time I was there, it took them 25 minutes for our 4 rolls - 2 of them were salmon hand rolls- very simple. And the place wasn't even busy yet. Luckily we ordered edamame and seaweed salad so we were ok for 25 minutes. But then- we wanted another round of those four rolls and it took over 40 minutes!! We kept asking what is going and they said there is a party of 10 people and the sushi chefs are working on their order. WE WERE THERE FIRST! And only ordered 4 rolls. We got angry and when we wanted the manager they sent us the guy who clears tables Who told us we will pay All you can eat as we started. Even thou we were really hungry still! I told him it is really unfair because we were sitting there for an hour and a half with only four rolls! So he said pay a la carte - so I had to pay the price of a full dish for an all you eat size!!  I paid and left. Very Offended and never going back. Needless to say I have been a regular for 6 years so I am very disappointed.",

    "text": "Came here for Goyemon's 3rd Anniversary Customer Appreciation event. They required reservations to be made, by request, from a site, that was posted through their facebook (<a href=\"/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.mongroupevent.com&s=f4f0240d54456519a963259c5db216aaf97b29c6a2a7210a22e704c21f3504fd\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">mongroupevent.com</a>). Reservations was first come, first serve. The reservation request form was simple to fill out, name, contact info, number of people, times wanted. I was surprised by this because I got no e-mail confirmation or anything. I had called a few days prior, and the girl who picked up a phone, said she had a list on a paper she found, under correct time and # of people, but had no info if it was confirmed. 2 days ago, (monday, i wanted wednesday), is when i received a confirmation text.   Upon arrival, our reservation was for 7:30. We arrived around 7pm. I had went in to ask to double-check my reservation. Was all good so went outside to sit and wait. There was another yelper there, Chris V., who had an reservation for 7pm, who was still waiting. Doriee and I were like, okay, they are a little backed up. No worries. She glanced into the restaurant to look at the blackboard, where they usually had their specials written. Toro was no where to be found on the menu. I mean sure, it was not on the original \"promised\" special items on their site (blue fin tuna, wagyu beef, foie gras), but day before, many have said they had AYCE toro. That got us really excited prior to arrival. By 7:35, i had went inside and asked to see the estimated time on wait before we get a table. She glanced around the dining area and she said there is a table whos paying, and will be leaving soon. Ok ! ... wait a minute ... Chris' reservation is 7pm.... so i went outside and waited. Less than a few minutes late, my name was called. UHHHH !!!??? OK THATS WEIRD.... Later we saw they were seated AFTER us. That's bad on their part. They've been waiting here since before we arrived too.... Just because i went in to ask, i got table faster?   SO ANYWAY.....  When our waitress came up to us to take our drink order, we had asked what was avail today and if toro was AYCE today. NOPE. Toro is limit 1 per person. Same for the Foie Gras nigiri. Wagyu beef, sea urchin, and blue fin tuna is AYCE. DANG IT ! sad. SAD!. SUPER SAD ! IMO thats a bad management on their part. Why allow AYCE one day, and be super limited the next? In my opinion, to manage better, to allow maybe like, 5 orders per person. That way, each who wants, gets a fair amount, and not be SUPER limited, but not be free to order. Bad call on their part. Also, as they had posted on their FB on 2nd day, items are avail until they run out? Uhm, there's a reason why you had a reservation to begin with. To limit the amount of people you have these two days. Not only did you have AYCE one day and not the other, you allowed walk-in's as well. Though it may have been \"Said\" that its a 1 hour limit on eating time but it is NOT enforced. People sit around and socialize after the end of their meal. No good ! Control and manage better !   With that, already a bad start. Doriee and my friend are already upset but we decided to stay and eat, since we were there already.   Ordered 3 toro, 3 amaebi, 3 foie gras, 5 blue fin, 5 yellow tail, salmon, 3 kobe beef, and a half of a 9-1-1 roll to start.   Blue Fin Tuna, was fresh. Each fish piece was actually cut fairly thick.   Wagyu Beef Nigiri. First 3 orders. VERY thin and \"broken\" cuts of meat. Like it ripped open because they sliced too thin. Meat was not tender, as what a high quality meat should be. The \"carrot?\" topping was a bit weird. Ponzu? sauce used made it weird as well. Was not a good combination at all. poorly executed.   Foie Gras Nigiri - topped with, i believe, fried onions?, seared foie gras, and probably an unagi (or similar) sauce? That was weird too. the sauce used covered the taste of the foie gras. You can really taste the foie gras if you ate a straight up piece, untouched with anything but, in combination with the fried onions, sauce, and rice. flavors gone. poor executed as well, in my opinion.   Toro Nigiri (fatty tuna) - the most sought after order. considering we were limited to ONE order per person on the SECOND night of their event, we tried our best to \"Savor\" the pieces. With my experience with toro, it is supposed to be naturally sweet, super fatty and tender, little to no chewing needed. This toro, thinly cut. not as tender and soft. Some chewy bits as well. SAD !   Amaebi Nigiri (Sweet shrimp) - this wasnt bad. granted neither of the people i went wanted to eat it, so i ate all 3 orders. Size of the amaebi was actually fairly large. larger than normal actually. nice and sweet, and gives a nice \"bite\" texture. fresh.   Uni Nigiri (Sea Urchin) - considering their no limit on sea urchin, i had high hopes for this as well. Considering their fast usage, i was expecting fresh and sweet. Nope. little to no sweet taste. okay freshness.   Overall experience, meh. Had high hopes for this event, looked forward to it, but was quite the disappoint.",

    "text": "Not exactly sure what happened to this place since the last time I've been here which was 2 years ago and I wrote that 5 star review. I was so so so excited to come here as it was to be one of my top priorities in my trip to vegas the past weekend. But..  Wow. I was so disappointed. The amaebi here was what i was looking forward to the most and it was a big let down.  When our order came out, there was 4 pieces as we each ordered one. Each of 3 of them were a piece of shrimp cut in half and put on separate rice as if to make it look like one whole nigiri. I knew this because one of them had a full shrimp on it and the comparison next to the three miniscule pieces was extremely noticeable.  Its an AYCE restaurant yet they limit certain items to one order per person only, which I do understand some items are more expensive but it really isn't AYCE if you think about it. And was precisely why it was more irritating because if I was able to get AYCE amaebi, I would've been fine with those pieces. But if we're getting only one time to order this, I expect it to be full pieces. It doesn't even have to be a fat piece of shrimp. It's just incredulous to me the fact that they shamelessly use half pieces and try to pass it off as if its meant to be.  When I asked the server about it they brought it back to the kitchen saying they would fix it. Couple minutes later they bring out the same plate and it looked exactly the same. I didn't want to make a big deal and just decided forget it. Was thinking to myself they didn't change it, when the server comes over 5 minutes later to explain that they didn't change it because it's AYCE and the pieces are set already for AYCE and that if we were to order amaebi off the AYCE menu separately, the pieces would be bigger. Which made absolutely no sense to me.  All the other food we ordered was forgettable, and also a huge decrease in size and quality. Which was not the case 2 years ago or else I wouldn't have been dying to come back. Oh yeah, and the green tea creme brulee that was supposed to have a thin layer of burnt sugar covering the entire top of the custard had about a fingernail size worth of that. So you're basically just eating custard if you order that, not creme brulee.  Step up your game goyemon, severely drowned my expectations.",

But why stop there??  The variety is excellent, not like one of those places where the all you can eat menu is limited to certain rolls - EVERYTHING on the menu is included. Apps, sides, rolls, sashimi, dessert! Wear your fat pants, you're going to need them!  Most of the pieces are smaller than what you'd receive in a traditional sushi place, but this is good for a number of reasons. a) it helps you be able to try more items on the menu without filling up too quickly, b) you can always order more, c) they do HALF orders!!    It is required that you eat \"everything\".. no pile of left overs, as they put it.... so go easy at first. If they catch you leaving too much, you'll be paying a la carte. however, there was a roll my husband ordered that he didn't care for, and they gladly took it back!  Super nice, and super yummy.   Also, not sure what other yelpers are talking about with \"lack of fresh fish\".... everything was really fresh!  Try the lemon roll! super yummy!!",

This was our first visit but I follow a few people on YouTube that have been to this place so I've heard good things about it. The restaurant sits at the of a very quiet strip mall, well at least at 9:00pm it was quiet. Hostess was pleasant and sat us, but when we told her that we were all probably going to do AYCE, she only gives us 2 AYCE menus so we request for more. She never came back w/ them so we asked our server. He never came back w/ them. So we asked the busser, finally! Someone understands that 7 people shouldn't be sharing 2 freaking menus!  Our waiter took his time taking our drink orders and even more time getting them to us. Even longer to take our orders which is a bit frustrating considering that they place an hour restriction on their AYCE! Needless to say-- their service sucked.  On to the eats-- mediocre at best. I'm sorry but if you can't get garlic tuna right-- WTF is wrong with you?! It's my fav and has got to be the easiest f-ing thing to make. First off I didn't taste any garlic, it was more of a \"lemon\" tuna. And then I ordered a cut roll, it was more rice than sushi.   Goyemon, I understand you're a small establishment and you want a good turnover on the tables, but if your servers suck, take their time with orders and stand around talking to other staff members for the majority of their shift (as they did the night we came in) then lift the hr limit bc your price point for what we rec'd was quite upsetting.

The wait for a table was about an hour - we got half of the \"VIP room\" near the cash register as there were 6 of us.  I think we came at a good time, the fish was incredibly delicious. The pork belly, surf clam, octopus and yellowtail were the big hits of the night. I noticed however that the fish-to-rice ratio for some nigiri was a bit smaller compared with the last time I was here.  Gluten-free note: some of their nigiri (like the albacore and the seared items) are seasoned with ponzu sauce, which is a citrus-based soy sauce. Soy sauce normally contains wheat. We asked if they could leave it off, but the server said the sushi chefs prepare them in a batch with other people's orders and thus could not (or rather, would not) prepare it without the ponzu. Bah! 3 stars for this. I wonder if we had sat at the bar that the chefs could have done something.  Their dessert offerings for dinner seem to change. I remember the last time I came here there was a plum wine jelly. This time it was just the creme brulee and chocolate mousse, along with the ice cream.",

    "text": "Most definitely my favorite sushi spot. I've been coming here for years simply because the quality of the fish is great and so is the variety. Our servers are always great and our food comes out at a good time. For about $30, you can get AYCE or get a la carte instead. If you get AYCE, it also comes with dessert which is a bonus. Their fish is yummy as well as their sides, I recommend this place to all my friends and family. The downside is the long wait. If you go during dinner, expect an hour wait at least almost always.",

Don't be cheap and pay for just one roll, do the all you can eat sushi! It is definitely worth it. My favorite was their Ecstasy Roll. It's topped with \"orgasm sauce\" and let me tell you... The name really speaks for itself. Another good one is the Crispy Rice!   I've been here probably 3 or 4 times and was never disappointed. If you're in town or a local, check it out!",

    "text": "Look, if you want to go to an AYCE Sushi joint in Vegas, go to Goyemon.   I regularly visit this sushi house every week to every other week. To get an interactive lunch or dinner, sit at the Sushi bar with Gian, Andre, or Hieu. They will make your sushi experience that much better.   Fish: 9/10. Freshness, quality, size, everything there. The only reason I give it a 9 is because sometimes they run out of Blue Fin Tuna (1 order anyways) and it's not Uni season (which isn't their fault) but still upsetting.   Appetizers: ?/10. Only thing I order is Shrimp Tempura and Baked Green Mussels. I guess those two are 10/10 so appetizers from my experience is 10/10.   Service: 11/10. I love those 3. They make my experience at Goyemon so much better. I can enjoy my sushi while enjoying my time there. The servers are always attentive to when my plates stack up and my water never reaches the bottom.   Only downside is that wait can be super long sometimes. Also, when it becomes really busy, the service might slow down. But what do you honestly expect? 4-5 Sushi Chefs service nearly 80 people that eat like pigs. It's going to be slow sometimes, just know that the sushi will make up for it.",

But it's not the only place I eat sushi at. I like the dimness of the room but not so much the price. I'm pretty sure I could eat AYCE sushi else where for cheaper. This is just one of those retaraunts I would save for a rainy day or date night. Lol.   Other than that they have some interesting rolls and seasonal interior decor which is pretty cool. They also have a bar, you dont have to be 21 to sit there, but it is an overall clean and nice environment. Cool chefs behind the bar as well! Lol.   Keep in mind that this place gets packed on weekend nights especially, im not sure about during the day but it's all good. It's worth a 20 minute wait max. Haha",

We ended up snagging the last two seats at the sushi bar. (Score) They even have convenient purse hooks under the bar. We both ordered the AYCE lunch ($21.95). They have a huge menu. Jessie luckily had been her before so she ordered some of her favs and I picked some that sounded tasty to me. I really enjoyed the fact you could order half rolls. It really gives you an opportunity to try lots of different rolls. Some of my favorites were the Sexy Girl, Lemon Roll, Pixie Roll and the scallops. I could go on forever, 'cause the truth is everything was good.   The chefs and staff were very attentive and never let my water glass get empty. They also thanked us several times for coming in.   I can not wait to go back again. I've been dreaming about it ever since! Mmmmm Goyemon!",

We needed highchairs and we were told they only have a total of two highchairs. One was taken already, and honestly we should have taken the other just to have at least one. They were going to seat us at too small of a table. Can you parents out there imagine a one year old on your lap at a tiny table for two eating sushi of all things? No thanks. So we decided to wait, but we were told that table will be available to us if we changed our minds.  Two mintues into waiting, the other highchair was taken and so was the table we were offered. They didn't bother to ask if we were sure we didn't want it.   My husband finally decided we should just sit down and get our orders in because we had already been waiting 35 minutes, with no end in sight. So there we are with 1 year olds in each of our laps. Thank God we have well behaved babes. But the customer service was horrendous. No apologies, no sense of urgency.   So my advice to this establishment, get a bigger staff to accomodate your large crowds and have more than just 2 highchairs! That was just ridiculous!",

With that being said, Goyemon used to be one of my favorite spots because the nigiri was the perfect size and the desserts and side dishes are amazing here. This past visit my husband and I agreed would probably most likely be our last, at least for a while. The rice was hard which is a major disappointment because I am a majority nigiri person so I do eat a lot of rice. The fish also just didn't taste fresh and they have seemed to cut back on the generosity of sauce poured over the white tuna and garlic tuna nigiri. The rolls were just okay. The salmon skin hand roll I ordered tasted burnt. You have to pay extra here to share with your child, even if he's only a little over one years old. The service was lacking despite the fact that it was not busy during the time we were there. Lychee sorbet never disappoints! And the AYCE desserts is also a plus. I'm not sure if it's just because we came here right when it opened so the opening crew servers and sushi chefs aren't their best but they definitely missed the mark for me this past visit.",

    "text": "After learning this is the same company as Sushimon, which was hands down the worst sushi of our lives, we stayed anyway because of so many positive reviews. We learned they were out of uni. Disappointingly, they offered no replacement. No extra order of anything to make up for it. This set us up for a bad time but we decided to stay as they had a nice list on the chalkboard. The freshness of their fish offering was acceptable and better than most other ayce places but lacked personality. I know this isn't Kabuto, but please make it more interesting than fish on inconsistently seasoned warm rice. After several orders of nigiri, we ordered a tuna roll to see how they would approach that. It was stuffed FULL of tuna with sesame seeds on it and the quality of the fish was pretty good. I enjoyed the skip jack nigiri most but that was taken off the chalkboard after only one order. Of everything we had, that was the best but really left me missing the uni as that was the entire reason we wanted sushi. An order of pork belly with a really decadent sauce ended our dinner course. Get that. Dessert helped make up for the uni. I loved the green tea Creme Brule and also the chocolate mousse which was more like a chocolate ganache. The BIGGEST problem of all was the 20 minute segment of our visit that we were ignored. We were told it had been shift change and our waiter had gone home. He had also not put in our order. Well, that explains things...lol. Wow.  Bottom line is this:  Not worth waiting in line for but would do if no wait and on a budget. After a return trip and the another and then another, I have learned to appreciate this place much more. I guess everyone is entitled to a bad night. This is definitely my go to AYCE.",

Everything was beyond my expectation because when you think of AYCE sushi, most places will serve you tiny pieces of fish with a shit load of rice. Not at Sushi Goyemon, their fish to rice ratio was soooo perrrrrfect. Also, their ingredients are fresh.   My bf and I had a great time here due to the exceptional service by all the sushi chefs especially Hieu (Head Chef) I felt like I was there to satisfy my stomach and some. I got a little comedy show out of it. Hieu is very funny and entertaining throughout our dinner. I'll definitely be back!!!",

My boyfriend and I are well aware of the policy for uni and sweet shrimp (one order per person), which was what we ordered but the chefs gave us a really hard time about it and would only serve us one order. Not only that but they were hispanic chefs and immediately started bad mouthing us in spanish..... unfortunately I speak spanish as well however I'm light skinned enough to pass off as a white girl..... so I understood everything. SO for any of you who are wondering what the chef is saying while they're staring at you while you're seated in front of them at the bar, don't think they're saying sweet things about you.   After we did not receive the order, the chefs continued to ignore us while we sat there in front of them. They continued talking and giggling while taking glances at us. The servers eventually came around to fill our drinks as we had nothing left and the server (also hispanic) asked the chef what was wrong or why we looked annoyed. The chef later replied in spanish that it was because we wanted \"more food\" so I interrupted and in spanish spoke out to them. OF course the chefs at that point turned bright red since they were unaware that I spoke spanish and was listening to them the entire time. Needless to say I was furious.   I'm still baffled that someone can talk all this messed up stuff while you sit in front of them.   Thanks to this I will never return.",

Don't forget to check on their daily specials! Love their sushi, which are quite fresh & plenty of options. I fancy their pork belly appetizer and found their dessert of green tea creme brulee and lychee sorbet to be amazing (which are served in a perfect tiny size).  Like their sashimi salad, spicy tuna rice cracker, white tuna, conch, hokki. Their tempura are crunchy. There is a limitation for  uni (can request  w quail's egg) & amaebi to one per person, which is totally understandable. You can request your amaebi's head to be deep fried or as a soup. They have plenty of delicious rolls and you can order it as a half or full roll. They also offer many kinds of noodle, side dishes, curry, salad, bento box, yakitori,  appetizer, desserts, side dishes  Besides their amazing arrays of items on their menu, this place has a lovely modern japanese decor and friendly staff with attentive service.",

The nigiri selection is good, the fish is fresh tasting and not frozen  and the rice they use is not hard not like other places I've been to. The specials they have are really good the salmon belly is excellent and the Japanese snapper is flawless. If you're craving sushi and you're up for AYCE come to goyemon you won't regret it.

When it was time for dessert I was already stuffed, but I was curious about the Lychee Sorbet. It was very sweet but other than that it was okay. Fulfilled my expectations of what a lychee sorbet would taste like.  Overall, 4.5 stars! I will definitely be coming back here again.",

    "text": "PORK BELLY!!  I can't  believe I haven't been here sooner especially because I live relatively close by. I went on a Tuesday evening around 5p and I did not have to wait. Friends have told me that they've had to wait 45 min to an hour for a table. It makes sense because there is very minimal seating.   On to the food.....this is one of the best AYCE places in Vegas in my opinion. Between the appetizers, unique rolls and numerous desserts, there is something for everyone. The quality is great and you can even order sashimi which is not always the case for AYCE. I highly recommend the grilled pork belly. It just melts in your mouth. Yum yum yum! Every roll I had was delicious and fresh. Also they let you order more than one dessert which not all AYCE places do.   The service is great! I have been ignored at plenty of AYCE places and have had rolls forgotten. Maybe it is because of the minimal seating the servers and sushi chefs don't seem like they are running around like crazy people like at other AYCE places.",

It's seriously one of my best AYCE experiences. service was friendly and attentive without being bothersome. ok let's talk food..we started off w/ 2 special rolls, salmon skin hand roll and pork belly. everything was good but that pork belly needs more than just good praises. literally, bites of congealed fatty meat heaven. ugh so good! I love how they do nigiri here and this is how they won me over because this is all I eat. they had specials which were bonito, blue fin, salmon belly and I also frequently ordered fresh scallop, uni, ikura/quail, mackerel, and white tuna. all tasted fresh and the rice2fish proportions were perfect! seriously PERFECT! Lol. I feel bad for all the other sushi places I go to because goyemon is my new sushi gf and she is o so delicious.",

I've found my new favorite sushi place here in Vegas.  I tend to roll solo and did so tonight so I sat at the sushi bar. The sushi chef, Min, was amazing. Since I was there by myself we talked most of the night. He was engaging and told me Goyemon is from the same owner as the Henderson Sushi-mon and you'll notice the similarities. Min also suggested side items based on the sushi I was ordering from him. It made the experience that much better.  And the service from everyone was awesome! Diane was my primary server but I believe every single person who works there stopped by to see how I was doing. I drink a ton of water when I'm dining out and my glass was always full.  Not only the service but the cuts of fish were top notch as well. Goyemon, you've got yourself a new regular now. I recommend everyone check this place out!",

Especially the hostess/cashier in the front, the lady has serious attitude problem: if your staff cannot deal with human being in the front, please schedule that person to work BOH, so she/he can provide the best use of his/her labor. We had problem with this lady on 2 different occasions already. Once was on Christmas eve /day, I called ahead of time to see if they were open, and was told they are open till 9PM. So I went there around 5ish, and was told by the lady that they STOP seating already, I understand that you were busy, but the tone and attitude she had was really bad, and rude. Second time was last night, we got there early, again 5ish, SAME person: \"sorry we stop seating for today unless you have a reservation\", I replied \"I thought you guys dont' take reservations?!\", she answered \"yes, we don't, but it's our 3rd anniversary, so we open for reservations.\", I asked her how would the customer know if they can or cannot book reservation, she replied with a VERY rude and unprofessional tone, \"well, if you have been to our restaurant for the last few weeks, we have been talking about it.\". REALLY?? so you are telling me that if I don't go every week, Im NOT welcome here?!? I work in service industry, I know how important it is to be nice to your customer, even the assholes, I always answer with a smile on the face when Im in front of customers, I also co-own a restaurant, and I know damn right it's NOT the right way to treat the customers. She better be the owner there, otherwise the owner should really consider to get rid of her, she obviously can not be working as the front of the house. There are plenty of sushi houses in town, food there is not bad, but for the last few times I went there, the service had been lacking and some of the service staffs have the attitude of \"oh-our-place-is-so-good-and-you-are-SOOOO-lucky-to-eat-here, now-what-the-heck-do-you-want-me-to-bring-you?\" I will not be the one that's paying money to take shit from service staffs.

The only thing is though sometimes the service is spotty and the server forgets your there, so order a couple of rolls at once.  The specialty rolls are pretty average like most of the places around town, I did notice that most of the rolls generally favored being made with a cucumber in it. Most specialty rolls I tend towards are ones with avacado; though the cucumber made rolls were pretty good. This place is average all around for the most part in terms of price, food a little better than average and service all around, but where this place excels is the fact its open late every night of the week til like 3! If I could give 3 and a half stars I would but I cant so 3 it is. Still great little spot for late night grub. Will come back again!",

    "text": "I've only been to this place twice and I had extremely opposite experiences both times.  The first time I went, it was on a weekday night for dinner with one other person.  We both did the AYCE and the service was fine.  The next time I went was on a Saturday night with a group of about 8 people.  So, unfortunately, this review is going to be based on my second visit.  First, we called about 3 hours in advance to see if we could make a reservation.  The person who answered told my friend that they were booked until late that night, then asked how many were in our party.  My friend told her 8 and then she said they only made reservations for parties of 10 or larger, so my friend told her 10, then she asked what time we would like our reservation.  Huh, I thought you were all booked up?  Anyway, so when the reservation time came, only 4 of us had shown up on time.  The server was getting anxious and frustrated that the entire party wasn't there (as if that was our fault?).  I understand how the server was feeling as it is a small place, but there was definitely no line of people outside the door waiting to be seated.  Had there been, I'm sure we would have been a lot more understanding.  Plus, he was expressing his frustration to us, which I thought was inappropriate.    This is where it gets good.  We finally had our 8 show up, plus an unexpected 1 after we had given away a two-top table (reserved as part of our initial \"10-person\" reservation).  The extra person had to share a seat with someone else and was never once offered by the server to grab an extra seat!  We had plenty of room in our area to accomodate this person, but instead, someone from our party had to grab a spare chair himself.  What the heck?!  Rolls were slow, but it was busy, so that was somewhat understandable.  I just don't understand how the server was getting so frustrated when we were all doing AYCE and some of us were ordering beers... I feel like he should have been pretty happy knowing that he would be making bank off of us.   I would probably venture to say that almost everyone in the group was disappointed with the service and some expressed that by leaving a tip that was appropriate for such service.  The sad part is, the decision to go to this sushi joint was based off of a Yelp recommendation and my previous experience with the place, but only AFTER we had called Oyshi and were told that it was packed.  We probably would have had a better experience waiting at Oyshi!  This is definitely not the level of service I would expect from the same people who own Sushi-Mon.  Not going to be visiting here again any time soon!",

The service was slow and they forgot orders.  I know AYCE sushi places are typically on the slow side, but this was horrible.  The restaurant wasn't even full.  I saw wait staff just talking to each other.  Inexcusable.   They were also \"out\" of uni.  We ate dinner at 6pm when the restaurant wasn't even full.

We came here on our last visit to Vegas to try a different All You Can Eat (AYCE) Sushi Place.   We got seated quickly since there was only 2 of us, and I wanted to minus a star since the service was so slow to get started, and sometimes in between, but their friendly staff made me change my mind though, and also they weren't strict on their \"hour rule.\"  The spicy tuna on crispy rice is soooo good!  It's a newer menu item, and I hope it stays permanently!  Oh and if you like spicy, then the 911 roll is SPICY!  My mouth was on fire!  I won't make that mistake again, lol.  Other than that you can't go wrong with the Nigiris, the fish tasted fresh and they the amount of rice they use is appropriate.   Be careful on the amounts you order, they will charge you if you have leftovers.  They were nice to the table next to me, and charged them for only about half the leftovers, but that doesn't mean that will be the same for everyone. As the desserts go, I was bummed that they were out of strawberry mochi ice cream, which is my favorite flavor!  However,  they had a tofu cheesecake, yes TOFU, it tastes like cheesecake, but slightly lighter/airy.    I can't wait till I can come back...I better start planning my next Vegas trip now!",

    "text": "Are there lots of delectable items for me to eat? Yes. That is as good as it gets for me at an AYCE sushi place. I am not a die hard sushi eater, so generally, it is hard for me to get my value out of an AYCE deal, but the selection is so broad at Goyemon that even someone who sushis only a few times a year can leave with a full belly.  The highlights for me included a nicely done crispy rice with spicy tuna (almost as good as Simon), fresh and tasty roasted vegetables, yakisoba (perhaps a tad over seasoned, but it was nice to have the option), and a slam-packed super veggie roll. I never leave full from AYCE, but on this night I did! And, yes, they have some sinful pork belly on the AYCE menu. You've been warned arteries.   I will say that I wasn't a fan of the calamari, but other were, so perhaps it is a personal taste issue. And, the green tea cake wasn't as delicious to me as mochi, but it was impressive to see the diversity of their dessert selection.  However, what was most impressive was that they handled a group of 20 with little to no hiccups and without the first sign of stress or disorganization. Checks were split without a hassle, and it was a perfect party atmosphere in the private room. I would highly recommend for a party.   Judging by my guests' consumption of fish, the quality is good, and I even heard people saying it was probably some of the best uni they had sampled. If a place has solid uni, I think it is safe to say they're working with fresh goods. I am sure it helps that the place stays busy! It is the spot to be if you're a sushi socialite!",

The all-you-can eat price is relatively cheap so it was busy all night even on a Tuesdays night. We choose to order a la carte because the AYCE menu is basically all rolls with assorted appetizers. The sashimi wasn't the best quality but it's understandable giving the super cheap AYCE price. All the cooked foot was good. Beef cutlet, katsu curry, hamachi Kama,etc. Our total bill was $70 for 2 adults and 2 kids. Definitely worth the price. There was a wait all night so be prepared to wait for a table. It was also hot in the restaurant and our whole was sweating so that took away from the dining experience",

    "text": "So when i was asked what i would like for dinner on our final night in Vegas i said Sushi please!!  Lucky for me, Minh D knew about this awesome place that is located off the strip and is moderate priced       ($26.95 for AYCE) and open till 3:00am. Parking wasnt bad and we were warmly welcomed and seated at a table right away. Hungry and not knowing what to order first (I love sushi and could probally eat my weight in it). Minh said he was getting the AYCE which was unlimited sushi that had to be consumed in 60minutes with no left over rice on the plates, if there was any traces of sushi or rice left overs they would charge you A La Carte prices. You can not share with other non AYCE people at your table, however you can share if anyone at your table is partaking in the AYCE challenge which is a good thing and highly recommended!! So after really thinking about it i decided to challenge myself and do it!! Heck you only live once, gotta try different things!!  In no order and from what i can remember before the sushi coma totally took over:  Grilled Tofu Salad-Grilled Tofu and spring mix served with a garlic sesame dressing.  Tryed some of Minh's Grilled Pork Belly-Grilled pork belly served with mango salsa  Half roll- Philadelphia Roll-Salmon,Cream Cheese,Avocado,Cucumber topped with smelt eggs  Half roll-California Roll  Five piece Roll (no half boo)- Spider Roll-Deep fried soft shell crab meat,cucumber,avocado with eel sauce and wrapped in soybean paper  Half roll- Chicken teriyaki roll (Do not order, sadly the chicken was so dry it almost gaged me)  Between all those rolls and eating some of Minh's i started to realize that i could not finish all of this. Taking a rest and also walking around the food just wasnt wanting to settle. Sadly i had to tap out half way through the challenge. This little cupcake has had her fill of sushi for the next month and a half!! I was looking forward to saving room for dessert which they had Green Tea Creme Brulee (my favorite).  Untill next time we are in town, i think i will come better prepared for such a challenge!!",

    "text": "Wow, no wonder this place is hopping.  The food is great, and the All You Can Eat dinner deal amazing for 26.95. It includes most of the regular menu items, like the yummy pork belly appetizer, and every roll on the menu, of which there are like 100 different kinds.  Plus, the service was fantastic, friendly and fast.   The pork belly appetizer was juicy and yummy...probably our favorite thing.  I would  recommend ordering it off the regular menu because you get 5 large super juicy pieces that for whatever reason were a bit better than the smaller pieces given on the AYCE version that the hub had. (I ordered off regular menu)  We also liked the spicy tuna on crispy rice, and the shrimp tempura.  Dude loved the mussels so much he ordered an encore, and we both liked the rolls.  We tried the Pixie roll (wrapped in colored soy paper...festive), the Volcano roll, the Sushi Max (tuna w shrimp), and the Sexy Girl roll, which was our fav and had everything but the kitchen sink, but had the cleanest flavor profile, rather than a mish mash with sauce.  This is a peeve of mine about sushi rolls everywhere, so it's not a criticism of Goyemon. Rolls are Americanized, sporting lots of stuff that doesn't belong in sushi (cream cheese, yuck) that they all start to taste the same, covered in the same homogenous sauce, or as Goyemon unfortunately called theirs, 'Orgasm Sauce', Please stop calling it that.",

I love to try a lot of different items so it's much easier on the stomach to get the smaller portions. :) The had a braised pork belly dish that we ordered three times because it was so delicious. The pork was so tender and it was beautifully charred on the outside with a nice mango chutney of sorts on the side. The udon noodles we got were also really good. Other than that, the sushi was okay, but it was nothing special. I expected a little more for the price.",

Man oh man did they quash that preconception.  Luckily, my wife and I came during the off season and didn't have to wait as long as other Yelpers have stated in their review but it was hard to find a table so we sat at the bar by the Sushi Chef.  This was a blessing in disguise!  We had Fredo as our personal sushi chef and he explained everything and how the AYCE sushi works there.  One of the best things that we did was to let him decide what to bring us. Humans by nature like to stick to things that they know and its nice to get a different variety.  He was even making creations on the fly!    The service was great and the sushi was top-notch!  Definitely more fish than rice.  Living in Chicago there is quite an abundance of sushi houses but this place blows them all out of the water.  Can't wait for the next time im in LV to pay Sushi House Goyemon another visit!",

The chefs are wonderful and very upbeat. They are more than happy to substitute things to meet your needs in rolls. You can always tell them things you like and have them create something for you. They are open until 3Am which works wonderful for late night dinners. The best is this place is All You Can Eat.  Some things I recommend ordering when you go: Nigiri Sushi: Super White Tuna Garlic Tuna Cajun Albacore Seared Tuna  Also from the NEW ITEMS list: Cajun Salmon Super White Tuna (these items come as just ONE piece so order a few. They will MELT in your mouth they are so amazing)",

You gotta drive out and some of these places are locals favorites.  Sushi House Goyemon is another sweet spot. AYCE and open really late, it's simply heaven. AYCE includes not only sushi but salads, appetizers, side dishes, and dessert too.  Poki salad - Fresh tuna and addicting tangy dressing.  Grilled tofu salad - The grilled tofu had a perfect seasoned taste.  Grilled pork belly - 2 slices of tender melt in your mouth pork belly.  Albacore - Above average albacore nigiri.  Cajun Albacore - This is my favorite nigiri here. Super flavorful.  Super white tuna - Excellent but not as good as Hikari's.  Spider roll - Very well executed here. Wrapped with soy paper.  Pixie roll - It's like a spider roll with more stuff. Also excellent.  O.I.D. roll - Baked roll with salmon and asparagus. Not bad.  Being super hungry, we made the fatal mistake of ordering too much too fast. By the time the first wave digested, Sarah A. and I were in sushi hell. We were struggling to breathe or move. Be sure to finish or else you'll end up paying in more ways than one!  Ironically, I ended the night with a bowl of lychee ice cream :D",

    "text": "This is probably my second favorite sushi joint in Las Vegas (I still slightly prefer Sushi Mon).  Goyemon does everything right.  Firstly, they have a vast selection of rolls, the creativity is certainly there.  Additionally, the service is good, the servers were attentive and made sure everyone in my party had their drinks filled at all times.    As far as sheer quality is concerned, I feel that Sushi Mon has the edge.  I hate to make this a comparative review because I'm sure that Goyemon has worked feverishly to create its own image, however, I feel that it's just something I can't help only because I always feel the need to rank restaurants.  It gives me a better sense of where to go, especially if I'm on time constraints.  I will give Goyemon the edge on their pricing, which is two dollars less than Sushi Mon's.  Goyemon charges $26,95 for AYCE sushi, which isn't bad in relation to what is charged elsewhere in the city.  Goyemon also allows unlimited dessert orders, which is exciting, especially once you taste the Fried Ice Cream Tempura.  I have no shame in saying I enjoyed three separate orders.  The lychee ice cream was also a highlight of my meal.    Goyemon is a great place to satiate the sushi urge in you.",

Although there still many items as part of the AYCE menu, items such as the kama are no longer available. The grill items and specials that were available seemed hastily thrown together because the cook was too busy chatting to other co-workers.  That brings me to the biggest change: the service! Service was terrible, especially at the sushi bar. I would order amaebi and get ebi instead. Ordering ikura resulted in masago. The sushi chefs seemed more interested in telling jokes to each other than getting orders correct. Worst of all was the waitstaff. If you sit at the sushi bar, the waitstaff doesn't seem to give a $h!t about you, instead focusing their attention on the tables. After the waitress responsible for my section left for break, I was basically on my own. Waiters and waitresses would walk by, make eye contact, and keep moving. Nearly fell asleep waiting for my check!  Poor service and less variety, make this once great AYCE sushi, just another AYCE sushi place found all over the valley.",

They also have snow crab on their daily menu with no order limit, but I wasnt that impressed with the quality of the meat. All of the fish was very fresh tasting, and they were pretty packed at just 5:30pm on a Monday night. The baked green mussels were the best Ive had out of all the AYCE places with the same dish. Very fresh and not overcooked. The miso salmon was also a daily grill special that was pretty tasty. Yuzu sorbet was tasty as was the ice cream.  Service was weird because it doesnt seem like they have set tables and I ordered with like 4 different people, 2 of them who were pleasant and had a positive vibe, and 2 of them that seemed a bit anti social and just wanted to do the bare minimum.   Also they have no uni until further notice due to bad weather or some random shit. Which makes no sense as every other sushi joint in Vegas has uni.. sounds like they are just being stingy and know they dont make good profit off it so they stopped ordering it even though its on the permanent menu. Minus one star due to mediocre service and lack of uni which is my favorite nigiri. Also craftsmanship of the nigiri could use some work. They really rush making the Nigiri which is understandable because they are busy, but still..  Otherwise the food is great and I left entirely too full. Deinitely my go to AYCE now since its so much closer than Sushi Twister on Boulder hwy.",

    "text": "Sushi House Goyemon is the BEST All-You-Can-Eat (AYCE) sushi place my wife and I have EVER BEEN TO. We miss it sooooo much now that we are living in the Bay Area.  We used to live about 10 minutes away from Goyemon, and we used to go about once every couple of weeks for either lunch ($21.95/person) or dinner ($26.95/dinner). There are some advantages to going for dinner - 1) they serve salmon belly nigiri, which is way better than getting regular salmon nigiri, 2) you can get 1 order of uni (sea urchin) and 1 order of amaebi (sweet shrimp), 3) you can order ramen after 11. Other than these three things, you can pretty much order everything else, including the AYCE dessert, during lunch.  Our typical order when we go for dinner includes the following items:  1) nigiri - salmon belly, hamachi (yellowtail), saba (mackerel), super white tuna, uni (sea urchin), amaebi (sweet shrimp), snow crab meat, unagi (fresh water eel), and ikura (salmon roe) 2) rolls - Sexy Girl, Hurricane, Sushi Mon Style Lasagna 3) side dishes - steamed gyoza, yakitori, shrimp and vegetable tempura, sashimi salad, miso soup, baked green mussels, udon, ramen (after 11pm) 4) grilled dishes - grilled pork belly, grilled super white tuna, grilled cajun salmon 5) dessert - lychee sorbet, green ice cream, strawberry mochi, green tea creme brulee  That order listed above might sound like a lot, but trust me, it's worth it. And you have to try these items. There is a reason why we kept coming back week after week, and why this is the first place we want to go eat when we visit Las Vegas. It's also why this is one of the easiest 5-star ratings I can give on Yelp. The only complaint I have about this place is that the wait can be very, very long. The restaurant is not all that big, and if you have a group bigger than 4, it can take 1-2 hours to get seated. They have a couple other restaurants owned by the same group - the other 2 restaurants are called Sushi Mon... both are just as good, and soon to be reviewed by me as well.   If you ever go to Las Vegas (and you are still reading this review), promise me you'll go to Goyemon or Sushi Mon. Ok? Cool, thanks!",

I was excited to see steak on the menu, but it was pretty disappointing.   Might repeat, but only for the hamachi, garlic tuna, and albacore and a few of the specialty rolls. Skip the rest.",

I love being able to pick up my sushi and not have it fall apart before it gets to my mouth.  Their service is friendly and prompt. There will probably be a wait, but they have an online queueing system that will constantly let you know, on your smart phone, where in line you are. So that's awesome.  If you choose to dine here, you WILL have an exceptional sushi dining experience.",

    "text": "I feel bad that it took this long for me to give this place a review. I have been to most AYCE Sushi places in the Las Vegas Valley and by far this place is my favorite to go to. This place offers daily specials, fantastic alcohol options and probably the freshest Nigiri I have had at any AYCE restaurant. They also offer things that most places do not such as Snow Crab Meat, Occasional Salmon and Yellowtail belly and Toro. Their appetizers list is also unmatched.  Whenever I come I prefer the Sushi bar and for good reason. These Sushi Chefs are among the nicest and most accommodating I have ever had the pleasure of being served by. The servers and the chefs play a big part of why i am a return customer. Always thanks to Andre and his brother. Every time I have come, Timmy has always been a fantastic server and has even taken the time to get to know us and ask us how our days were.  Most of the time this place is packed because of how popular this place is but every time, the wait was always worth it for me. As for service I find it to be slow at times but sometimes they are understaffed but I can always see them giving effort to tend to everyone. If you do plan to come here with a big party please come earlier than expected because you will be waiting a little bit. For a place as good as it is, this is somewhat expected.  My only gripe with this place is actually very weird. Most Japanese restaurants I go to I like to sit at the Sushi bar and get to know the chefs. I love the interaction that as a customer I can know the people making my food and someone to talk to while i eat. I was very sad to hear that the Chefs here are unable to share a beer or alcohol with their customers. They work very hard and I honestly believe that sometimes they deserved a small break and from a consistent customer I feel it would be just them accepting a small token of my appreciation to all their efforts to keep me and other customers happy. I really hope one day I am able to drink with my favorite Chefs in the City.",

With most sushi places, majority of the appetizers are meh; this place included. The service has been on and off every time I've come. When they're busy they lack in quality service, to be truthful. It's not bad, but more so not attentive and rushed.   So I give this place a specific 3.8 stars.  5/5 nigiri  3/5 service 3/5 appetizers (with the exception of a few) 4/5 specialty rolls",

My sushi vocabulary was a little rusty because I haven't had sushi in a long time! I was so excited that I immediately ordered the wrong thing. I chose the 3 hand roll combo ($8.95) which is ice cream cone shaped. The cone is made out of seaweed though. I had the spicy shrimp yum roll, scallop yum roll and the crab stick roll. I was happy with two out of the three rolls. The crab stick roll is made up of a fake crab stick with rice in a seaweed cone. It tasted too plain for me. The special also came with soup and salad. The dressing for the salad was a little strong tasting but still good. We ended the meal with dessert. I had the lychee ice cream which was really delicious! My husband had the fried ice cream.  The second time I came here to have lunch by myself. I was trying to kill time before meeting up with coworkers for happy hour. I thought if I ate really slow I can kill two hours but I was wrong. It only took an hour with dessert. I ordered the Chicken Katsu combo ($7.50).  This is basically  fried chicken strips. I haven't tasted this in such a long time! I used to order this when I was a newbie to Japanese cuisine. It was as good as I remembered ! The meal also came with 4 California rolls ,rice, soup, salad and more salad! I ended the meal with lychee ice cream....yum!",

Everytime I try to come here, there is always a wait and HB and I are not about that life.  So we came for lunch. HB got a cucumber roll and loved it.  I ordered Edamame, Steamed Shumai, Seaweed Salad, Tuna Poke, and yellow tail, tuna, salmoon and fresh scallop nigiri. ' I was FAR from impressed by their Tuna Poke. Amando S. can make it better at home! The Edamame was crisp and good... the Shumai was PLAIN - I think I ate like ONE piece. The Seaweed salad was good... aaaaaand the Nigiri... It was OKAY. The Tuna seemed a little fishier than I normally experience however the Scallop WAS quite good. The scallop is so hit or miss depending where you are at and they served it very well here so that was definitely a good thing!  I just don't know what all the hype is about! It was GOOD don't get me wrong but my mind was not blown!",

But kind of ridiculous. The nigiri slices are thin on top of the rice boulder. Great daily specials. Service-please give yourself 2 hours for lunch in a halfway full dining room. Everything came out 1 at a time with a good 15 minute wait in between everything. We got dessert before our last rolls even came out. (They probably came out after we left)  I really want to like this place more, but it's tough.  Will go 1 more time to confirm, but I think every round you order, they add another layer of rice.

These are my usuals:  Rolls:  - Sexy Girl (shrimp tempura roll with spicy tuna, crumbs, and eel sauce) - Pastel (crab stick and cream cheese, topped with shrimp, avocado, and eel sauce) - Magma (shrimp tempura roll topped with salmon, eel sauce and Sriracha)  Side Dishes: - Pork Belly (my favorite, but only included in dinner price AYCE) - Spicy Tuna Rice Cracker (panko-breaded rice topped with spicy tuna, eel sauce, and spicy mayo, also only included in dinner price AYCE)  Desserts: - Tempura Ice Cream (it tastes like they use cake batter) - Green Tea Creme Brulee (it's usually only on their board of special desserts)  The rolls are really good, and it's really convenient because one menu has pictures of all the rolls, while the other gives descriptions of them.  As for the service, they're really good! I never have to usually ask for them, as they're really attentive and come to me as much as they can to check on me.  The only downside is that the wait times can get really long. Sometimes I've had to wait over an hour. It is a pretty popular sushi place, and they don't accept reservations. Also, they don't typically seat you until you're entire party has arrived.  Overall, I really enjoy this place. I would definitely recommend it.",

Only negative was that our orders didn't come as quickly but can't blame them since we had a large group of guys",

This place provided us with an excellent experience that remained in our thoughts for the next few days and kept us yearning for more!   The staff was super sweet and friendly!   We all opted for the ayce lunch.  We ordered multiple rounds of sushi and dessert, and the waitresses were very attentive and sweet.  The nigiri was fresh! Our favorites were the white tuna, scallops, quail egg, salmon, hamachi, and conch! One of us also ordered the ayce dinner, so they can get their one order of sweet shrimp and uni -- it was well worth it! The uni and ebi was sweet and yummy! The rolls were good, too! However, I love the raw stuff so much more, so my review is based on that! Everything had the right amount of rice, also!  AYCE also includes appetizers! We enjoyed the salmon kama, chicken teriyaki skewers, octopus poke, sashimi salad, and tuna poke!  OMG, dessert! It ended with few rounds of green tea ice cream, red bean ice cream, lychee sorbet, and strawberry mochi! The strawberry mochi was delicious!!!   We'll be back, and we'll be sure to spread the word! Gotta love the stamp card, too! If I lived in LV, I'd be a super duper frequent diner! I thought Reno ayce was good, but this was even better!! :D",

    "text": "I was visiting Vegas for the holiday weekend with my family and I've always wanted to try an All You Can Eat sushi place in Vegas since I've never been to one and I know Vegas has a lot.   I decided on Sushi House Goyemon after reading some good reviews and it was only 10 mins. from our hotel.   Wanted to try and get there early since from reading the reviews they get busy. We actually ended up getting there about 1:30pm. I for sure thought we would have to wait but we actually got seated right away. Guess we got lucky in Vegas. Haha There were four of us, me,  my wife and our 2 boys (11 &  13).  We all had the AYCE except my wife. I thought the price was pretty reasonable for AYCE sushi. I was quite surprised by how many choices there was. From Nigiri, to rolls, to side dishes and even dessert all included in the price. Being that it was AYCE I pretty much went all out trying a lot of different things. I read on here you can order half rolls and that's what we did. I thought that was very cool.   The quality is pretty good. Fish tasted fresh. The pieces were kind of small, but it didn't bother me. The service was good. Our server kept coming back to see if we wanted to order more items. My youngest didn't eat as much sushi as he normally does and our sever actually said she changed his AYCE to ala carte because it would be cheaper. Thank you. Saved me money so I can gamble more Haha.   Overall I had a great experience. I love sushi and it was great not having to worry about what \"color\"  plates we're all eating. lol I would definitely come here again the next time I'm in Vegas.   Tip: on the menu it says that for lunch it's a 45 min limit and dinner is 60 min limit. We stayed about one hour but they didn't really bother.",

    "text": "I have to admit that I only had 2 real meals this weekend because of EDC, but I was glad Goyemon was one of them. My friend from Vegas strongly recommended forme to try this place before heading back to LA. We came in at around 5pm (group of 5) on a Monday night and the wait was around 20 minutes (not too bad compared to the other reviews). The restaurant was pretty small, but the service was relatively quick and accommodating. There's an hour limit on AYCE dinner. We went on an order rampage immediately, focusing mostly on the nigiri. The rice:fish ratio was a bit off for me (too much rice) but it wasn't too overwhelming.  Onto the fish. I personally ordered a sashimi salad, which was delicious and refreshing. For the nigiri, I tried the tuna, salmon belly (GREAT), octopus, uni (limit 1 order/person), sweet shrimp (GOOD; limit 1 order/person), yellowtail (YES), super white tuna, snow crab hand roll (too much rice), scallops and unagi (always my favorite). The fish was fresh and I felt like I definitely got my money's worth (turned out to be around $32/person). There were a lot of special rolls that looked great as well. My friends liked the rainbow roll, but not the spider roll. They also enjoyed the salmon, salmon belly, uni, sweet shrimp, sashimi salad, edamame (garlic buttered) and miso group. Goyemon offers a bunch of dessert, ranging from green tea or red bean ice cream to vanilla or strawberry mochi. I thought it was nothing special, but was pleasantly surprised by the numerous options.  All in all, for the same price, I prefer this over a Vegas buffet any day. The AYCE option for lunch looks a lot more worth it in comparison to dinner, so I'll probably be back for that if I'm ever in the area!",

    "text": "High Quality AYCE, or all you can eat, is the holy grail for food lovers.  Sushi House Goyemon, with it's top notch selection of nigiri, sushi rolls, and cooked platters is Vegas' answer to this call.   We went on a weekday night and following Yelp advice arrived early.  Good thing too.  Even though it was a mid week dinner, the place filled to capacity and soon there were people waiting.  We were lucky and snagged a seat at the sushi bar, where many regulars sit.  The nigiri comes out quickly and you can place orders directly with the sushi chef instead of flagging their busy wait staff.   Nigiri - very good nigiri especially for AYCE. Highlights were bonito, the super white tuna, conch, uni, and amaebi.  Cons are that you are limited to only one order per person for uni and hotate.  Still though, loved the fresh cuts, minimal rice used (ie: no filler) and great selection.  Oahu's Hakone with unlimited toro, uni, and amaebi may rank higher but this place has good nigiri.  A steal.   Sushi rolls - a variety of baked, fried, and fresh rolls are available and you can even order half orders.  Win.   Cooked dishes - after hearing so much about the pork belly, I admit I was disappointed by that dish and the cooked dishes here.  No agedashi tofu, no chawan mushi, and they ran out of hamachi and salmon kama.    Appetizers - really enjoyed the seafood salad, poke tuna, and surf clam salad.    Overall, we had a great meal at Sushi Goyemon.  At $26.95, it's an incredible value if you love nigiri.  The izakaya dishes are lacking but the desserts were great.    Sushi House Goyemon accepts credit cards, including Amex.  My Buffet Rankings:  1) Westin at the Bund, Shanghai - $60/person and an excellent selection of sashimi, seafood, roasted suckling pig and fresh hand tossed Chinese noodles.   2) Hakone - all-you-can eat toro, uni, kobe beef, and amaebi, $60/pp.    3) Sushi House Goyemon - truly great nigiri, many great appetizers, and desserts and an unbelievable price, $26/pp 4) Navio at The Ritz Carlton - only down a slot secondary to the astronomical price ($88/price) but made up for with a spectacular view, top notch service and great food. 5) Bellagio, Las Vegas - congee, prime rib, shrimp/crab",

I finished my work for the day before I can do my vacation. I usually, like a most west coast californian people stay very quiet. The staff is very friendly. And so the chef, particular Mr. Andrei. This service to crack people who are new to establishment is extremely well done. I never seen most place serviced that well.  The quality is superior grade. Im surprised for the service and quality this place has to offer.. They do have half order of rolls on some items. The side orders are truly amazing as well (i.e Calamari, Pork Belly). Andrei gave me some suggestion on some item (there were some item was 86ed). The interior is very intimate with the simple decor. What is crazy, is this place closes at 3.   Otherwise, I will come back here when Im in Vegas and refer all of my known associates as well :)",

Make sure you make reservations cause if not you may be waiting quite a minute because when I was sitting an hour flew by so fast, where did the time go. From raw salmon to rolls, everything was amazing and fresh tasting. When stopping here, make sure you keep a track cause you may lose track and it'll keep coming more and more and you may get more than you can handle unless you got friends to help you. The place looks a bit small with the tables and the setup but it's the right size to make sure everyone gets taking care off and gets the food as soon as it can to you and your party :)   If you go time visiting or a local, stop by and see for yourself.

Walked in and was surprised this place was so busy but was excited since that usually means its good. I was by myself so I sat at the bar. I was greeted by 3 very friendly sushi chefs. This is the reason I keep coming back. The sushi chefs are always inviting and will help you with any questions you have!they are awesome! The sushi quality is pretty good as well!always super fresh tasting and so much variety!now for the reasons I give only 3 stars. the first time I dined there, I was charge $2.75 for soda WATER....that's just tap water with bubbles.never in my 12 years of being in the service industry have I ever Been charged or charged a Customer for tap water with some C02. When I asked the manager he had no explanation for me and said \"yeah it's just like that and there's a charged for it.\" Now if I was the manager of a nice sushi Resturant I would respond with \"yes ma'm there is a charge for water with bubbles here but since it's your first time and you didn't know I would be happy to make an exception and remove it off your bill this time\" whatever dude my bellys fool of delicious sushi. and I'm not in the mood to end my night poorly over some bubbles.....I'll just order regular tap next time....last thing is I've been to this place at least 4 times now and only last night was I asked if I had an AYCE stamp card....ummm no I don't because I was never asked in the first place....the servers need to communicate with eachother more and I think the manager needs some tips on hospitality.....",

Some menu items were fairly unique to this restaurant and not something I have seen in other sushi restaurants.  Definitely fun for a group that is all willing to order the all you can eat to be able to pass around items for sampling. I will definitely be back!",

I had good experience before. Unfortunately I got a bad experience this time. One of the servers destroyed my lunch time. I chose \"all you can eat\" for all of us. We enjoyed everything I ordered. Only one thing happened, When food came to our table, some dishes I haven't ordered such as striped bass,saba...  I told the server I did not order that. It wasn't our food even I did not know what is the fishes they took it to us. The server responsed to us  with unpolite and bad attituded. He said the orders were corrected, But it was definitely not True. I am sushi lover I should know what I want. If I order those dishes from him Why I did not know the dishes. I used to be server when I was young.   Service is the best part of the restaurant. I hope their management could be improved as soon as possible.",

What is fun - the fact you can order and order and order - since you can get half roll (maki) you can really eat a lot of sushi and try everything.  Pay attention to the black board to the right of the sushi bar - with specials.  Salmon Belly was available one night - super fantastic.  Super White Tuna - fantastic. Salmon and Hamachi really good.  Scallop - good. Conch, Halibut and Sweet Shrimp - were just OK.  Lots of desserts included. Sea Weed Salad, things other than sushi are included but you order with your waiter and not the sushi chefs.  Sit at the sushi counter - fun and they just wait on you attentively - asking you what you like and giving you whatever you want.   Spicy Tuna crackers everyone raves about - didn't seem that special. Everyone raves about the Pork Belly - was OK.  But hey - its included so try it.  Service is good.  Sitting at the Sushi Bar - much better because you have the sushi guy right there asking you what you want all the time. Fun to take a friend and just go thru all the sushi you can possibly go thru.",

I thought, ok I'll just ask this nice looking person to slide down a seat so I could sit with my husband.  Apparently this is a huge no-no.  The hostess intervened and said that they can't ask anyone to move.  Whatever, we left.  So I came back today with a large group.  Tons of open tables but none together.  You would think since they don't take reservations they would seat their customers appropriately to prepare for a group of five or more (not too uncommon right?). They should really take reservations and seat their customers in a systematic way.",

    "text": "This place is great! AYCE sushi place in the middle of the desert. Was in Vegas for the weekend for work and decided to pop in here to satisfy my sushi craving.  Upon entering the small restaurant, I realized the the sushi chefs behind the counter were MEXICAN!.  Omg, I thought, do I eat here or do I dare risk the long waits of other ayce buffet lines on the strip? With the nearly full house crowd close to 10pm at night, I figured it can't be THAT BAD!  To my surprise it was quite good!  Ok not sushi sho good in Berkeley, but the fish was very fresh and they had a great selection, including the \"black board\" specials. The black board specials has the more exotic cuts of fish, toro, black caviar roe, kama, and a bunch that evades my brain at the moment, but something that you would pay $8-9 for nigiri for at any bay area sushi place. Black board specials are the way to go! IT also changes as the night progresses, sometimes they run out of stuff'; only to be replaced by other things.  AYCE is basically off a menu, and you order whatever you want.  There's a great selection of hot foods and salads, along with tons of nigiri and rolls. I don't do JIVE ass rolls like Nobu K, so I went for all nigiri.  There is a uni limit of 2 pieces per person but that didnt bother me as there were plenty of other great fishes including toro, and all your standard nigiri cuts of fish.  Yes the fish was cut a bit uneven and some of the rice fell apart before it made it to my mouth. but for $25 you cant beat it!  Everything from the cucumber salad to fried tempura shrimp to the black board special cuts of fish were delicious including the desserts.   We sat at the sushi counter and were served by the sushi chef, whom were all mexican for the exception of one -japo chef who seemed to  be the head chef.  Good service by the servers and the counter chefs.   I was very surprised at the quality of each item we ate and wish we had one of these in the bay area! I would definetely go back when I am in vegas next time.",

    "text": "Prepare for a wait at dinner. Friday night was really busy, but if you want service you just smile at the waiter and lift your eyebrows. Be patient. The service was great. You'll see some familiar faces from Sushimon. The tables are really close so I wouldn't bring someone to tell them something personal or important or whatever.  We've all been to a billion sushi restaurants. This one is really good. At the same time so are a lot of other places. I guess what I'm trying to say is come here because it's another great place to get sushi.  Pork Belly- Thick chunks of pork with delicious fat still on it grilled until there's a pleasant char then they are covered in a sauce very familiar to me. This dish reminded me of childhood bbq's. So of course I loved it and been thinking fondly of it. Try it.  Spicy Tuna Rice Cracker- Drenched in yum and eel sauce, looks like too much, but it wasn't. Still able to taste the sticky, crunchy rice. Everyone loves spicy tuna. It was real yummy and I haven't seen it on another menu. Try it.  Yellowtail collar- Comes with a standard sauce. I love collar. It's a pleasure to pick out the variety of textures of meat in it. Like meaty parts away from the bone are drier and flaky. Then there's the darker moist parts you scrape off the bone, so good. I cleaned the bones. I love most grilled fish though so take my view as you will.  I always order mackerel sashimi. On this night it was generous pieces that were nice and oily. I love mackerel so much. I was happy with it here.  We also ordered a couple rolls, but they were standard. I can't even remember which ones they were. I remember they were good though.",

The sushi chef had a great attitude and the other people at the bar were friendly and helpful for a newbie. Tips: ask about fresh fish of the day - you can order from the specials board as part of your all you can eat - you can so 1/2 orders of the cut rolls (most of them) good option, since you are required to eat everything you order or you are charged The only less than perfect thing was the tempura shrimp inside the rolls was luke warm and didn't seem fresh fried, but reheated in the little oven (Order the side of shrimp tempura instead which came fresh out of the Fryer and was heavenly!) The desserts are even quite good if you still have room, I recommend the black sesame mochi... Even tho I was full I ordered 2 of these and then, I confess, a 3rd before I left.",

The definite pluses of their menu is that they offer octopus and tuna poki! Toro, uni, as usual, but they also offer AYCE lychee sorbet, mochi ice cream, and green tea ice cream. They also have a serving of their black sesame creme brulee and their panna cotta dessert which I hope to try soon.  If you're looking to entertain a big party in a private section, well fear not as they offer a special room for 15. Unfortunately, you can't reserve the room, but if you have your group all together they'll be sure to offer and accommodate your needs.   The service is every so wonderful, and I sincerely thank the servers for always being on top of things especially with the busy pace of the restaurant. It was also extra nice of them to offer roses to all the special mother's out there for Mother's Day. My mother was lucky enough to have one. Thanks for that save Goyemon as I didn't have flowers to offer my mother that day!",

The food comes out really fast so you can order small amounts as you go (Which in my opinion is the best way to eat AYCA)  The apps are soooo delicious.. Best steamed gyoza and shumai in town!   Their Moon roll and their Caterpillar roll are both fantastic.   Plus you can finish it all with tempura ice cream!   And Try the green tea brulee. It's really great!",

Their dessert items are awesome too. Dinner on a Tuesday was about $27 which was more than reasonable considering all we are and how delicious everything was. Nice servers too. Will be back soon.",

Some friends brought me here for the first time and I thought I'd never meet the AYCE $29.95 volume for the price, but I was totally wrong.  It's worth it, too. Everything on the menu is included, so you linger with friends, order as your'e ready for it and stuff yourself until you grow gills.  I've been 3 times now, twice with the original friends who brought me and then I brought my BFF from out of town, who also loved it.    My faves: Lemon Roll (FOREVER!), Jala Jala roll and Yebinsu. I also love the Super White Tuna. And the salmon belly, when they have it.  Basically, everything is awesome. Beware the 9-1-1 roll unless you have an iron-clad palette. Your taste buds will both love and hate you.   The service is great, the patrons friendly (and mostly japanese, which told me right away that this place was going to be good) and their matcha iced green tea will keep you up for 4 days. Drink lots, kids.  I already want to go again. Can we go again?",

Read the reviews about the pork belly so had to try it.  We ordered a bunch of other stuff too.  Service was excellent and fast.  The pork belly was amazing, but next to me I will get a half order.  Its very heavy.  Most items on the menu can come in half orders.  Only two complaints.  The decor is beautiful but I hated the layout of the restaurant. Not romantic.  The tables were all almost next to each other almost deli style.  No booths or anything to give any sort of intimacy.  I ordered the spicy tuna on crispy rice and, to my relief, never got it because I was so full.  But it showed up on the bill.  No problem they took care of it.  Very reasonable and a place for both the adventurous and the non-adventurous sushi eaters.  Plus open late!",

The sushi was on par with some of the best sushi from my hometown. I kept track of what I ate and it would've came out to $120 bucks!  I'm not sure if it would've been worth $120, or even $60, but all that food for $26.95 is an absolute steal. 5 stars!  YEaaah!!!!!!",

Then after our 2nd order we were completely ignored. The sushi Chef didn't even acknowledge or we couldn't even grab his attention. We had 3 other people to the left of us so there wasn't too many people he had to take care of. Even our waitress passed by us and check the other 3 people besides us and not even asked us if we needed anything. My boyfriend started getting irritated. So when we wanted to order one more rolls we just decided to order from the waitress but was like \"ohhh I can't take your order only the sushi chef can\" and I'm like...he's already ignoring us. We both lost our appetite by then and decided to leave. Just when we asked for the check the sushi chef finally asked if we wanted anything else. I didn't even look at him and just said no. We didn't even tip because service was just ridiculous. I would go back for the food but not for a while.",

There're various delectable items for me to eat. I strongly recommend their nigiri of scallop and sweet shrimp flavor, of course, and my favorite sea urchin nigiri.  They were really fresh, naturally sweet and delicious. I also missed shrimp tempura a lot. The Crispy surface was a contrast mixed with the soft and sweet shrimp perfectly. Besides, the atmosphere was very inviting and the service was friendly. Our server was busy, but the service was still attentive. They made me feel warm and fuzzy.  I thoroughly enjoyed this place and cannot wait to go back again.",

    "text": "My husband and his parents went to Sushi House Goyemon for the first time last year to try their AYCE.  I couldn't go because I had to work.  My husband said the food was good but service was very slow because they were understaffed.  They charged $3.00 for my 1.5 yo son to share with my husband which was perfectly fine with them. Since hearing about this place and reading all the reviews on Yelp, I really wanted to try it.  It took me 'til tonight to try Goyemon because I was pregnant and wanted to avoid raw fish.  I was super excited when my husband and I decided to eat at Goyemon tonight because I have been dying to have some yummy nigiri since having my daughter.  We were seated promptly by a friendly host and shortly after our waiter came to ask what we wanted to drink then everything went downhill... *sigh*  Our waiter asked if we were doing the AYCE and I quickly said yes.  I asked if my son, who is now close to 3 yo, can share with us. The waiter said no and if we shared with him then we would be charged the full dinner price of $26.99!  He handed me a regular menu and suggested we order something off of it. I was not happy but my son needed to eat so I ordered the Niku Udon ($9.95) and cold tofu ($2.50).  My son finished the 3 pieces of cold tofu and ate about five spoonful of the udon.  I have been to other AYCE sushi places that didn't charge for small children and allowed them to share with their parents. Oh, and other AYCE sushi places had better service than what we got here at Goyemon.  Our waiter wasn't friendly at all.  He forgot to bring water for my husband though I asked for water for everyone.  No one ever came by to refill our water. We constantly had to flag someone to ask for water.  Our waiter never once stopped by to ask how we were doing or if we needed anything else.  We had to flag him down and ask to order more food.  The garlic tuna, super white tuna, uni and surf clam tasted good and looked fresh but the salmon wasn't fresh at all.  It looked like it had been sitting out for awhile.  The conch nigiri tasted like orange peel... yuck!  The sashimi salad was nothing special and the dressing was actually very salty.  Their pork belly, although very fatty, was very flavorful.  We ordered several half rolls which didn't impress me at all and sadly I don't even remember the names of the rolls because it was just that underwhelming.  After eating some so-so sushi, I was really looking forward to the dessert given the good reviews from fellow Yelpers.  My husband and I ordered the mango mousse, chocolate mousse, tempura ice cream and green tea brulee. Both the mango and chocolate mousse were good.  The green tea brulee was so-so... nothing spectacular.  The tempura ice cream was a big disappointment.  It wasn't freshly made and the tempura was cold and soggy.  My son, seeing all the dessert, wanted some too.  Given Goyemon's no sharing policy with children, I couldn't give him any but by this point I was so fed up with the bad service. It's not like our waiter even cared about us or would even noticed if my son was sharing with me, so I fed him some dessert.  My husband and I have agreed that we will not be visiting Sushi House Goyemon again.  We prefer Sushi Koma (Flamingo and Durango) and Sushi Tachi (Simmon and Centennial Pwky).",

    "text": "After reading the good reviews, my wife and I decided to give this place a try.  We got there at 3:35p and decided to get the lunch ayce.    First off, the waitress (Kate), seemed rude and bothered just by taking our order.  Which were only 3 rolls and 2 appetizers.  It took awhile to get our order, but we did not mind.  Meanwhile, another couple behind us had gotten up and left because their orders took so long to come out.  We didn't think much about it at the time, but we should have taken it into consideration.  The inside of the rolls were fine, but the amount of rice on them were ridiculous.  They packed on so much rice it seemed each roll had the equivalent of a small bowl of rice on it.  We were starving so we finished everything then we had to flag down the waitress to place another order because it seemed she did not want us to order anymore.  Since our first order took so long we decided to get 3 more rolls.  One of the rolls was the spider roll which only came with 5 pieces (boy, were we wrong).  When the orders came out we were taken aback by the size of the spider roll.  The diameter of the roll, no kidding, was 3-4inches!! It had so much rice on it.  The other 2 rolls had quite a bit of rice also.  So much so that the group next to us kept looking at our plates and commenting on how much rice were on the rolls.  We've eaten quite a few ayce and we have never seen a spider roll that large before or the amount of rice on a regular sushi roll.  We tried to eat all of it, but there was too much rice and we had to leave several pieces, plus it was already a little past 5 o'clock.    Next, we asked for the bill.  We did not even order dessert because we were so full from trying to finish everything.  When the waitress came she said that we had to eat the remaining pieces of sushi or we would get charged extra.  Seriously?!! Was she out of her mind?  We had already tried to burst our stomachs trying to finish the rolls that were on rice steroids.  We told her there was no possible way we could finish the several remaining pieces.  She had the nerve to say, \"why don't you just eat these 3 pieces\".  Again seriously?! That was pretty much what we had left.  We had no choice but to ask to speak to the manager.  She told us we would have to wait 10mins.  We did not want to make a scene so we waited.  After 10mins , I was starting to get really upset so a male waiter (don't think he was the manager) came and asked if he could help us.  We asked for the bill and he said that we had to finish.  We explained to him that we understood their rice policy, but if they had put a normal amount of rice on the rolls it would not have been a problem.  I'm sure when he saw the remaining pieces he was also surprised by the amount of rice, because he said we can call it even and that next time please be aware of the policy.  He had the waitress get our check and to top it off, the waitress charged us for the dinner price which is $5/person more than lunch. She knew we ate the lunch because she gave us a slip with the lunch time on it when we first came in.  So, again, we had to flag her down to get the bill corrected.  When we finally left it was close to 5:30p.      I hope the several pieces of sushi with too much rice was worth it to Goyemon,  because there is no way that I will ever try this place again.  This place is definitely not worth it.",

After waiting 25 mins for a table for 2, while a small table for 2 has been open for 20 mins, 3 guys walk in clearly speaking the same language as the servers and hostest get seated in front of us and or a their party they ha to add a chair. Very disappointed after a friend recommended to come here. Even if the food is outstanding, due to the very poor service I received to start my dinner I will NEVER come back here again or recommend this place! They are very busy but that is just clearly wrong.",

But given that is offers quality fish with an AYCE option, Goyemon gets 5 stars.  I've been to AYCE sushi places all over the country, and I have to say, Goyemon is the best I've ever been to.  Must tries: pork belly, uni, hamachi collar (when they have it).  I also enjoyed the desserts--especially the green tea cake with red bean icing and the creme brulee.  Will definitely be going back everytime I'm in vegas",

You order off the menu if you go with the AYCE option and there is a lot of menu to go thru.  Other reviewers have gone over items and the great choices.  I've had the chance to go thru about 1/2 the menu (we were a party of 8) and everything was well prepared.  In my last two visits the shari was well prepared and held up to chopsticks and dipping in soy sauce.  However the cooking technique in general is solid and the ingredients quality.  Be prepared for a wait as it can be quite busy.  This has become one of company must do's when in LV for events.",

    "text": "Wow...but more in a surprised disappointing way. I know how hard it is to get a 4.5 star rating on Yelp so I was expecting much, much more from this place. I am (or was, it's been a while since I've been) a fan of Sushimon and with all the hype, I've been wanting to try this place for WAY too long. Had to work late for Valentine's Day so what better day than to try it with my gf for a midnight dinner.  Ordered the Orgasm as we sat down since it's my favorite Vegas sushi invention. And the gf wanted a cocktail. Nothing looked good on the drink menu so I ordered her the vodka midori martini. Maybe I messed it up by asking for less vodka, more midori, but the drink was a zero star. It tasted like medicine.  Wanted to do the AYCE, but found out that the things we wanted to eat wasn't included so we ordered a la carte.  The 1) Orgasm came and it was more like the Tease. Yes, the tuna was definitely some of the freshest! But the taste was just not balanced (too much citrus).  We then ordered a few other items:  2) Dynamite - Had to return because it was burnt 3) Beef Tataki - I like it fine (nice and rare) but gf thought it too salty, which I made the mistake of saving a portion for later and soaking in the ponzu soy sauce, it became too salty for me too 4) Spicy Tuna Crispy Rice Cracker - probably our favorite dish, unique! 5) Yum Yum Scallop Handroll - the mix was too dry and the taste bland 6) Nabeyaki Udon - so-so as the sweet mushrooms overtook all other flavors and made the broth a sweet, salty mess 7) Got tempted by other Yelpers' Yelp on the pork belly so I ordered it last minute, and wish I hadn't. The flavor was there but the pork belly was undercooked and served room temperature making the fatty part gelatinous.  Still hungry but decided to quit at that. The taste discerning will note that the flavors served here are primarily SWEET eel sauce on everything or the yuzu, mango salsa on everything else.   Perhaps I may make it back here someday but I would only do so if in the mood for AYCE.  After all, one's expectation is lower for AYCE than it is for a la carte sushi. My experience was only a 2 star but if I was to rate it based on fresh ingredients alone, I would rate it much higher, but with taste considerations (of course), I'm truly surprised that Yelpers rate it this high!",

That concept just sets this place a part from the other sushi places.   Each sushi bite is small with small pieces of rice too so you won't have the urge to just hide the rice. Keep in mind they will charge u if you don't finish your food! Sitting at the bar they make the sushi much better with added salts or Yuzu! I don't know I let the sushi chef make it special for me!   If rolls are your thing they do offer half rolls too but since Im all sushi all the time I didn't even consider those!   Other appetizers worth mentioning was sashimi salad, garlic edamame, seaweed salad, and the dessert! I wish they had black sesame ice cream! But hey u don't come here for dessert!

We wouldn't have bothered if we knew that prior to going there. We went during dinner and the restaurant was bustling. We got seated right away on the Sushi Bar which was perfect. Order our beers and looked over the menu. After being disappointed seeing the 1 per person UNI and AMAEBI I looked for my next favorite Sushi Bar items which are Maguro, Hamachi, Sake, Hotate Sashimi and Raw Oysters but none of those were part of the AYCE menu. The server said we could order appetizers and side dishes from her but we needed to order the Sushi items from the Sushi Chef. There were 4-5 Sushi Chefs. We must have been there all of 15-20 minutes and they didn't acknowledge us once. Unfortunately, we paid for our beer and went to our favorite Sushi Bar in Las Vegas.",

    "text": "Am I a glutton for All You Can Eat (ayce) punishment? Yup, I certainly can be.  You see, there are some very, very real consequences associated with actually arriving at the outer limits of one's ayce threshold.   One of mine is having to be rolled out of one of these places. The other is trying to waddle around as my stomach goes into hyper drive and desperately breaks down mass quantities of proteins, starched, sugars, etc.   And yet . . . there are times and places when it's totally acceptable to find yours truly in these awkward predicaments.   And guess what?  Sushi House Goyemon happens to be one of them places. Surprise! Well, you shouldn't be and could actually be kinda insulted I used such a cliche. Anyways.  Now, did I find the 60 minute time limit somewhat perplexing? Yup but I was up for the challenge.  And for what they're charging, I consider it a fair compromise.  Did I make the mistake of ordering way too much shrimp tempura instead of purely focusing on all things sushi? Yes, I regrettable did, but it is one I will not so foolishly make the next time.  But the real question is, how was the sushi? All things being considered, not half bad. And the food overall was fairly tasty for an ayce.  The serving size of the nigiri often had me wondering if I had inadvertently ordered from the amuse bouche section of the menu, but the thing is these morsel size portions works.  You get enough of a taste to decide if you want more, and if you don't, you're not stuck with a slab of something you don't want.  Unfortunately, none of the sushi was super standout, but in Goyemon's defense, after so many servings (and sake) my taste buds become less acute and I can't really distinguish the good from the really good.  That being said I would recommend not ordering half size specialty rolls and ask if they could make them into specialty hand rolls instead.  I'm really a fan of hand rolls since there seems to be a better balance of seaweed, rice, and fish when it's rolled up like an ice cream cone.  And if you still have any room (and even if you don't), try the dessert. For the love of ayce, try the dessert.  Well worth it.",

Make sure you know what to eat in a hour, that is the amount of time they allow you to have from 4pm on for dinner.  For lunch it's 45 mins. The spicy tuna is no joke here, extremely hot, so much that having a half roll was good enough for me, my mouth was getting raw, yes that spicy.  Not to far from the strip, not big but a nice size to have a small or large group.",

The food is still good and fresh, and they just updated the menu and the dining area a little, but the service staff seemed inconvenienced by us trying to order, bringing out the correct ideas, refilling our drinks, or anything to make the meal memorable aside from poor service. It's really a shame, this was our go to spot, kind of put a damper on our date night. Maybe it was due to being a shift change (thats what it looked like at least) on a weekday night (630pm), but the staff waiting on us was way more interested in leaving than serving us.",

Daily specials didn't seem to change the 2 times I went but that's okay--it was still good.  The fish was very fresh and cold (I hate when it's warm) and not a huge amount of rice. It was more about the fish. We had tuna. albacore, salmon, snapper, and yellowtail.   Of course we had a ton of rolls all of which were awesome. I love that they have a huge menu and tons of things that other sushi places don't have.   I usually never get dessert but the Lychee Sorbet is so good. Don't pass it up.",

We waited about 10 min to all get seated, and that was because we had to wait for our whole party to be there first.   We definitely made our money's worth!   Who would think to eat sushi in the middle of the desert? Where we all come from we have fresh fish, but! We were not let down by this place at all.  We tried the Rainbow roll, Uni, Miso soup, Spider roll, Tuna roll, and lots more. We had more than enough to eat, for such a decent price! I'm gluten free, and they also provided me with Tamari (gluten free soy sauce). For dessert we had strawberry mochi, and I had two servings of Lychee sorbet. All of the food was ono (delicious)!   We were served by the Birthday Girl, Monica. And she was fabulous! She came around often, refilling our waters and drinks and she also brought out a few different items that she thought we would like to try, which we ended up really enjoying. All of the food came out in a very timely manner.  Mahalo Monica! I hope you get that free meal from this review! ;)",

Apparently their freezer was broken which is understandable like shit happens but then our server seemed mad from the moment we started ordering?   Their salmon nigiri was good BUT it felt warm to me. Maybe because of the rice i dont know but i just wish the fish was colder. There was two occasions where they gave us food that we did not order, but luckily my friends were down to eat it anyways.   They had some good rolls but nothing I tried amazed me. My favorite is the magma i think its called. I kept calling it magmar lol. I always try the salmon skin hand roll at every sushi place i go to and it was not good here. Our food was taking forever to come out.   One of my favorite things about this place is their decor! I really like their ambience with the lights, i would definitely come here for a cute date. Wait time to get seated was 30 minutes. Overall  goyemon is not my favorite but its good!",

    "text": "Not gonna lie I had much better expectations for this place. After reading countless reviews I was expecting spectacular service and even better sushi/fish quality. I would have to say the best AYCE sushi in vegas was very underwhelming. The whole thing was so so but let me explain.  Went here on MLK weekend on a Monday around 2pm. Wait was minimal which was unexpected due to the holiday weekend. We waited around 5 min. We sat at the bar which was great because come to find out for 21.95$ lunch there is 45min TIMED PERIOD for your lunch. Yes they time you from the time you sit down. Other things I wish I knew before sitting down 1) 45min timed period for lunch and 60min for dinner 2) Any leftover rice or sushi is charged by the a la carte price 3) ORDER 1/2 rolls! yes you can rolls in 1/2 vs full 8 pieces 4) Sitting at the bar was great b/c of the 45min timed period for AYCE  To tell you the truth the quality of the sushi was ok. We had sake, ikura, tamago, scallop Nigri. An organsm roll, a crispy deep fried roll, a ultimate salmon roll and a couple other rolls. Nothing really stood out. All the rolls had too much rice in them. We also had Garlic edamame and the poke bowl. Both come highly UNRECOMMENDED because the garlic edamame was cooked and burned and super oily. Also the poke bowl was such a disappointment. The quality of the tuna in there was the quality of was i can only equate to Cardboad mushed into a cube and dyed pink. It was tasteless and you can def tell that it was previously frozen.  I really though I was going enjoy this place b/c of the reviews but the time limit and the quality made it highly unenjoyable.  Probably will not be returning bc I felt forced to stuff as much sushi in my mouth as humanly possible in 45min.",

AYCE SUSHI for $26. 95 a person.  It was fresh and delicious.  The waitress kept coming and asking us for orders. They were busy but I felt that we were well taken of. On top of that, the hostess or manager, Kieari (sorry if i misspelled your name), was absolutely fantastic! Very energetic and personable, she was all smiles, seating guests, answering phones, delivering food, and clearing dishes. She truly made this dinner amazing! Go visit and say Hi to her! Definitely a must when i come to Vegas now.   They have a daily blackboard specials that you can order from and everything on the menu is included in the AYCE pricing.  Pork belly was oh so tender and yummy. Really this is sushi heaven! You must go!",

Most of the nigiri is fresh and of good quality, except for the seared tuna, which came out dry, like it had been sitting out for a while.   Im not sure if they need to hire more servers or the sushi staff is undertrained or just slow, but we will probably not come back since there are many other ayce sushi restaurants in town that offer just as high quality dishes and does not have serving issues.",

Good quality fish for an AYCE and they don't pack the nigiri with big blocks of rice....but no sashimi available here.  I honestly don't know much about the rolls...since I tend to be a pure fish lover....versus the cream cheese/avocado/mayo/etc mixed into the rolls. My favorite nigiri is the salmon belly, white tuna, unagi, and toro...don't forget to check out the blackboard near the cash register...it has the specials for the day!  Similar menu to Sushi Mon off Maryland Pkwy...with the exception of special dishes like the spicy tuna rice cracker and the seared pork belly....I literally will eat 2-3 orders on my own to the disgust of those around me...but I think buffets should definitely be a no judgment zone .....I will gladly admit I wear my \"elastic band pants\" for all you can eats...don't want any buttons holding me back =)  Dessert is awesome with selections of tofu cheesecake, green tea creme brulee, green tea cake, red bean/green tea ice cream, mochi ice cream.  Only minor complaint...some items have been \"unavailable\"...specifically  the lychee sorbet and the yellow tail collar which is succulent morsels of fish with ponzu suace, A MUST TRY that is if they have it....so maybe leaning towards a 4 star rating compared to the first time I went there....due to some missing items.",

    "text": "After reading all the wonderful high-rated reviews, I bookmarked this spot as our final cheat meal for our stay in Vegas during the Olympia 2011 weekend. Hmph...it was not the best idea and here are the reasons why:  1. When we got there around 7:45pm, Saturday night, the place was packed...and I mean packed as in it's super small and doesn't have much seating available, so when you include the AYCE option, I can tell why the wait here is always LONG. We waited for over 45 minutes before a table finally decided to get their bootays up and leave. Even though, the waitress was kind enough to offer the 3 of us seating at the bar, we opted to get a regular table and let the bar be available for the couples/singles.  2. The AYCE menu is quite confusing. You can't have everything all-you-can-eat...meh?? There were certain items on there were you were only allowed one order per person. So the math did get confusing for me. I'm no bueno with numbers here people!  3. FOOD: The pork belly that everyone raved about was MEH for me. The sushi rolls were also A-OK, nothing too crazy besides the nutso 9-11 roll we ordered. That habanero sauce they used on that roll had my mouth feelin like Angelina Jolie for a good 1/2 hour. OMG! The sashimi and fresh fish was very fresh indeed and those orders always came out the quickest. The chicken skewers were...what they were, just chicken skewers with Teriyaki sauce all ova em, again...nothing special there. The ONLY thing I really did enjoy was the AYCE option of DESSERTS! Mmmm, mmm bombalicous! I had 2 of the green tea creme brulees (which were sooooo decadent and perfect) and 1 red bean ice cream, how can you go wrong with anything that has beans in it? Yes, I'm Asian and I love my beany desserts! =P  4. SERVICE: It got kinda confusing who our server was. There were some dudes that would come out with our order but didn't take our order and then we had about 3 waiters that did take our orders back & forth. Major minus? Food came out WAY too slow-momo. I know there are only about 3 chefs working, but the place is tiny and I've been to plenty AYCE sushi spots and never had to wait about 15 min between each order. I'm ALWAYS hungry! Especially now since I'm still in precontest season for my fitness competition, so if I'm looking forward to a cheat meal, it better be top notch and the food better come out FAST. Sushi House Goyemon did NOT do this job well.  Would I come back? For the desserts? Yes. But even that's not really worth the trip there.  P.S. We had to hit up Jean Philippe Patisserie at the ARIA (since it's the only thing open super late and close to our hotel) right after we left this spot cuz my ass was still HUNGRY as EFF!",

    "text": "This is now my favorite sushi spot in town.  It is the same company as sushimon in GV, which was my previous favorite.  It's pretty standard for AYCE sushi, with the prices and selection.  But what makes these guys different than every other place I've tried in town is the grilled fish menu on the AYCE.    These little bites of grilled fishes are some of the best food I have ever had.  It is just as fresh as their nigiri, but marinated and sauced up, and a nice cooked flavor.  Definitely try the pork belly and the cajun salmon....but even the grilled tofu is good, and I don't usually like tofu.  Service is hit or miss...sometimes they are really busy, and you will receive orders over 20min later, so make sure you remember what you ordered during each round...they don't really forget, just takes a while to the table on certain days.  Other days, the service is pretty good, so again, hit or miss.  Also, they have an extended dessert menu on the AYCE, which includes a chocolate mousse, a definite must have if you come visit.  Bonus, this place is much closer to the avg Las Vegas local and tourist, being around 10-15min from MGM.  Go!",

    "text": "I haven't tried all AYCE sushi restaurants in Vegas but I've experienced some pretty bad to mediocre ones. With that, I'm pretty confident that my opinion of Sushi House Goyemon being one of the best AYCE sushi in Vegas holds water. I like my sushi simple, fresh and nigiri-style. Not really big on sauced-up rolls (which they also serve). Because of Goyemon, why would I go and overspend at places like Blue Ribbon Sushi? Most of the fish that comes to Vegas is frozen, right? They also claimed one night that their uni was from Santa Barbara. One order of uni per person for AYCE is still a steal!  The service is a bit slower than some local AYCE restaurants and the wait time can be ridiculous if you're there at peak dinner hours. But I take busy as a good sign that people are recognizing something special in Goyemon. They also offer other delectable fare like grilled pork belly and desserts you should definitely make room for. There are the cutest tiny servings of green tea creme brulee and chocolate mousse you must try, also part of AYCE. Make sure to check their board for the specials of the day. And don't forget to get your stamp card if you're planning on becoming a regular.",

There was a bunch of locals that got off work and drunk people here, the wait time was over 30 minutes and there was only one person in front of us.  The staff was pretty rude, when we asked for more water or utensiles, they didnt have any expressions or any saing just brought it over, no thank you, or how is the food, can I get you anything else, Also We made eye contact quite a few times but they ignored us.( people I was with were all sober locals) so I dont see why the service was so bad.  We had the talked about pork belly which was good, Should have ate way more of that than the sushi.  I would go back if yama isnt open.  also there is a one hr limit and anything uneaten you have to pay for.",

But, since trying Sushi House Goyemon, I realized I've been missing out.    Now, let me tell you.  This place is truly one of the best sushi places I've ever been to.  I mean it's hard to imagine that at a city like Las Vegas where Sand and Cactus Trees predominate, you'd find a place like Goyemon that offers its patrons one of the freshest sashimi they ever experienced.   So, a group of my friends came here for dinner on a Thursday night.  We all signed up for the AYCE dinner special, which was a little less than $30.  My friends mostly ordered the Special Rolls, but I stuck with Nigiri.  I really enjoyed Goyemon's Garlic Tuna along with the Sweet Shrimp (too bad it's only one order per person).  I still got to try some of the special rolls that my friends ordered, and they too hit the spot.  In conclusion, I'll definitely come here next time I'm in Vegas, or will make an attempt at the other restaurants off the Strip.  Heard Lotus of Siam is also a must go to place...",

I had high expectations for Goyemon and they did not disappoint.I was pleasantly surprised to find that its actually a very nice sit-down restaurant. A little classier than most hole-in-the-wall sushi joints.  NIGIRI: They served large, dense cuts of fish of the freshest quality on their nigiri sushi. Good fish/rice ratio.  ROLLS: They do half-rolls! Take advantage of this luxury!   SIDE DISHES: I'm addicted to the baked mussels. Unfortunately, the only reason Goyemon isn't 5 Stars is because of the poorly made mussels. Not enough sauce and not enough flavor. The mussels are usually a bit fishy as well. :( Be sure to try the salmon collar, melt-in-your-mouth pork belly, & the tuna rice cracker.   DESSERT: Goyemon has the best dessert selection out of all the sushi joints in Las Vegas. I had the tofu cheesecake and my friend, the tempura ice cream. You know how most places put a limit on just 1 dessert? Goyemon will give you as many as your heart desires.  TIP: Be sure to show up early! Gets crowded very quickly! Call 1 week in advance to book the party room if you have a group of 10+ They have a private tatami room.",

They brought us orders that werent ours and didnt bring out some of our actual orders, of which we had to remind them. What ticked me off the most was the blonde host with glasses, did not get her name. She approached our table after we paid saying \"It's been an hour, I have another party waiting for this table, we're gonna need you guys to leave\". I've never had anyone tell me/us that in my 6 years of eating sushi lol. I told her we would have loved to have left 20 mins ago if our desserts came out on time! She then asked us what we ordered and I assume she told them to prepare it right there and then. It shouldn't take 20 mins to make mochi or take it out of the box for 3 people. She then stood by the sushi bar and not by her post, probably feeling embarrassed. 2 of the desserts came out while one did not (we waited another 10 mins for it). We just walked out and had ice cream elsewhere. I'll continue going to Sushi Mon (their other property) instead. 5 stars for the food but 3 for the customer service skills.",

FYI - if you do not have their AYCE, the menu and pricing can be confusing (2.5) Service: messed up bill which my hubby had to actually grab a menu and show the waitress that she was wrong (2), Value: given the experience here, I wouldn't come back.(2).  I was enthused to see a highly rated sushi place. So I nagged the hubby to come try this place out. When we arrived. we weren't hungry enough to try their AYCE option. Instead we ordered their deluxe bento (with a side salad and miso soup), katsu curry and a side order of the grilled pork belly.  FYI - if you order a la carte, the prices are all on the actual fold-out menu NOT what's on the AYCE sheet or the supplement page on the placemat. Make sure you check your bill because we were charged for the more expensive price for pork belly (ie, supplement for the AYCE add- on) instead of the a la carte price. The waitress asked the chef instead of checking the menu and didn't believe us. My hubby had to ask for the menu to show her the difference.   The deluxe bento suffered from many problems but let's just start off with the baby upchuck masquerading as some sort of misguided egg salad they put in the top right hand corner. (see pic: <a href=\"http://www.yelp.com/user_local_photos?userid=h9RUaaHa5kcQKqtJ-sgS0Q&select=pNoiIE--ccKc0V8o2PwRgw\">yelp.com/user_local_phot...</a>) Or perhaps the completely anemic \"teriyaki chicken\" which didn't even have grill marks on them. The fried salmon and tempura were both soggy. We had to ask for tempura sauce. Sashimi - the fish was cut into thick chunks but isn't cut in the proper matter allowing the fish to melt in your mouth. For what it's worth, the California maki was okay.   There was little to no katsu with the katsu curry.  (FYI - the cutlet in the photo represents about 40% of the entire cutlet which is rather small for $8 see pic: <a href=\"http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/JyxHvtj-syke7m9rbza7mA?select=tl0GrsOs4ViWjApsgaBvog\">yelp.com/biz_photos/JyxH...</a> ). The curry itself was overly thick and bland due to the addition of perhaps too much potatoes.  Finally, the grilled pork belly. While the texture of the pork belly was nice, the flavour of the pork was overly smoky for our tastes. The addition of the rather oddly sour tasting mango salsa was a deteriment to the dish. Certainly not something we would order again and we found it expensive for the price.  Overall given our experience with a la carte, we probably won't be stopping by for AYCE. But certainly check your bill if you do decide to do the a la carte tasting.",

    "text": "I swore I already wrote a review for Goyemon but since it disappeared....  I love love love Goyemon! They deserve 5 stars because of their consistency and the overall experience. You get the best of both worlds! Quality and Quantity!  Don't expect sashimi or the best sushi in the world though.  You pay for what you get.   Their fish is fresh and they don't stuff their nigiri with rice.  It's a good proportion.   My favorite at Goyemon is the Super White Tuna - melts in your mouth *O*.  AYCE (All You Can Eat) Dinner is $26.95 but expect to pay about $35 per person for tax and tip. You can choose from appetizers and desserts.  They have ramen late at night.  BTW, they are open til 3am. YAY!!! (exceptions to AYCE: limit 1 order (2 pieces) of Uni (sea urchin) and amaebi (sweet shrimp) per person)  Tip:  Always look at the Specials Menu on the Blackboard before you order!!! Toro or salmon belly are good must-trys.         Expect to wait if you're rolling in during traffic dinner time or if you have a large group.  If you time it right, they have a private room that can seat a large group. However, they DO NOT take reservations.",

    "text": "I'm seriously considering going back to all my AYCE sushi reviews and moving them down a star. THAT's how good it was.   I can't believe this is the 3rd Japanese restaurant in this location in 5 years. To go from Sushi Hana to Shin to this. Goyemon has by far the best decor of the three. Sushi Hana just had these gross green painted walls and an old ass TV showing ESPN for chrissakes!   Along with your usual suspects for nigiri and rolls...they have a ton more including daily specials. Highlights included their inhouse smoked salmon (smokiest salmon ever!), big eye tuna nigiri and \"kobe\" beef nigiri although the beef being kobe was highly suspect. No big deal. Pork belly was like the best piece of bacon ever.   I also like how yellowtail collar (1 order per person) is on the menu. So good! Its like a super meaty fish chicken wing kinda sorta. A must.   We were pretty lucky to be seated around 6pm since there was a bit of a wait for tables about 10 min later. Not that many seats so definitely be prepared to stand around for a while.   I love how this is so close to my place. No more drives to Sushi Mon on Sahara for me. I'm actually ready to go back here...like...now.",

Orgasm salad - seared chunks of tuna on a bed baby mixed greens in a creamy yet not too sweet sauce. OMG heavenly! Grilled Tofu Salad - Cubes of firm tofu nicely charred. Not bad. Poke salad - standard Toro - Limited to 1 - A little chewy but not bad Big Eye Tuna - Melted in my mouth, a must try if available Super White Tuna - Can't go wrong with ono! Heavenly Sweet Shrimp - Slimey! Pass Pastel Roll - Good, not as heavy but little on the cream cheese (if you like that sorta stuff) Udon - I wanted Ramen but it's not available till after 11pm, standard noodles in a broth. Good thing to eat if you are hung over. Green Tea Cake - A little dry for my taste Green Tea Creme Brulee - Standard processed   Service was good.  Usually we'd stuff ourselves more, but we had a white party to attend to and eating ayce sushi and trying to fit in a tight white dress isn't cute lol.  For the price, it's about $1-$2 more than Hikari but the last few timves Ive been to Hikari have been disappointed and rather much go here even if they have only nigiri.  Try it out!",

My beef dish was terrible. The quality of the meat was so low I sent it back. The meat was so fatty and the smothered in sauce as if I might not know. I was grossed out and tried to eat the salad.. seaweed, the deep friend veggies, the terrible California rolls, and the rice. The rice was the highlight.. It was overall so bad I sent it back.

We made the choice to come based on the fact we'd heard they stay open so late and seeing as it was already close to midnight, it sounded perfect.  When we arrived, we were greeted so pleasantly by the host.  There wasn't an empty table in sight as I've experienced with most AYCE sushi places, but geeez, even at midnight?!  I shouldn't have been surprised :)  We were promptly seated at the bar where I had a great view of the chefs preparing yummy sushi masterpieces.  Unfortunately (for me), I'd already eaten before the movie (and boy did I EAT!), so I didn't feel prepared for AYCE.  Their menu has a lot of variety, however, so I didn't feel left out and deprived for long.  I decided on the ahi poke salad, which was great!  My husband, of course, went with the AYCE and he was pretty impressed.  His favorite was the rainbow roll.  I've never sat at the bar of a sushi place...crazy, considering how many times I've eaten sushi.  There is something VERY pleasant about watching the rolls being prepared and interacting with the chefs (who, by the way, are so ridiculously friendly and attentive at Goyemon).  By the time we were getting ready to leave, it almost felt like home here.  Everyone was so pleasant and the food was incredible.  What more could we ask for?",

No one wants softball size balls of rice with paper thin sushi... We are smart enough to see past that and goyemon respects the customers in this way... The uni and sweet shrimp one order per person rule is crummy but most ayce don't even let you get one order, it's usually extra so I'll let them have that!  Fried shrimp head isn't on the menu but it is all u can eat,too! Yesssss...  The daily specials are great and make it so every experience is different. They have a lot of great homemade desserts too like tofu cheesecake, green tea crime brulee..so good!  Also the pork belly appetizer is yummy!     We come here every trip to Vegas because you can't beat the quality, portions, variety, and freshness.  Also love sitting at the bar so the chefs can make their own fun creations for us!! Can't wait to go back. They will call your phone too if there is a long wait so we can drive away and do other things instead of sitting and drooling over everyone's sushi...",

Also, they charge you for left over food, so don't even bother.  There's a very nice selection of sushi rolls, very creative and imaginative menu. Started off with Dynamite app: Baked baby scallops with mushrooms and onions. Yum! The menu features Baked rolls, Tempura rolls, Deep fried rolls and Specialty rolls (about 40 varieties all together). Fish was very fresh and rolls were delicious!!

As a special thanks to Fredo who made these two visits not just satiating, but thoroughly entertaining for my local and visiting friends alike.  this place has the freshest and most delicious sushi of any AYCE place I've ever seen. the Uni, the blue fin, the Amaebi...all to die for. As for the special creations made at the bar (PS: SIT AT THE BAR IF YOU CAN)... the creativity and variety of the dishes are a wonderful change of pace from places that just fill their special rolls with sweet mayo and cruchies and call them \"unique\". The baked mussels were also amazing. better than the fried oysters (we ended up ordering the mussels 3 more times).  And the seared pork belly app, also on the AYCE menu, was sinfully good. I tried to stop ordering it, but I gave up trying to stop after my third.   also, if you like something different with your amaebi, instead of the fried heads, try them in the spicy miso broth instead.  This is a place I already came to at least once per Vegas weekend and now will try to come to at least 2 or 3 times.  Ideally, I would come here 11-times in a row. (wink wink)",

Their selection of AYCE is way better than a lot of the places around here and you can substitute soybean paper.... The garlic edamame was amazing and every roll was fantastic. I like it because they don't overload the rolls with rice and you can order half rolls!!  Definitely recommended!!!",

    "text": "Whoever would have guessed that I would be reviewing 2 sushi places in one day?! Let alone visiting 2 in one day :P   After my epic experience at Yummy Grill, I enthusiastically accepted an offer from Taylor T. to try Goyemon, later that evening :)  Upon arrival, it was pretty packed & seemed to live up to that aspect of the reviews. Fortunately, we didn't have to wait too long. We passed the time by people watching and funny commentary. Taylor T. was adamant about trying the AYCE & obviously, being a sushi noob, I was a little iffy about the whole AYCE eat thing. But, after being made fun of by the hostess for not being sure of the AYCE & that usually it was the guy getting AYCE & not the girl. Oh really?! The gauntlet was thrown & the challenge was accepted! Take that hostess!  So, thus began the AYCE madness & the 60 minute timer began :P I started off with some gyoza & yakitori, just to ease into the whole thing. My first sushi choice was a half order of the Hurricane roll. It was pretty good & I would order it again. Taylor T. had the half order of the Taylor roll (go figure) I actually thought it was really good & enjoyed it more than my choice. Next up was an order of the mussels. They were a little chewy, but sweet & very tasty. We followed up with half orders of the 911 & 007 rolls. The 911 was a little too spicy for my liking & the 007 roll was a nice simple roll, but kind of chewy. We finished the sushi portion off with the Domingo roll. This was definitely a good choice. Basically, a sushi roll topped off with some pico de gallo. What a great combo! Finally, we had the green tea creme brulee. It had a very subtle flavor, but really creamy & delicious. I just wish it was bigger, and AYCE though ;)  I will definitely be coming back for AYCE! I enjoyed my first AYCE experience here & look forward to more visits. The staff is very nice & really helpful & accommodating with suggestions & omissions of certain items.  And last but not least, shout out to the Goyemonster himself, Nelson Q! And thanks to Taylor T. for the invite!",

    "text": "Not many people fancy raw fish, but those who do enjoy fresh sushi or sashimi have their favorite go-to place.  THIS WOULD HAVE TO BE MY FAVORITE SUSHI RESTAURANT OF ALLLL TIIIMMEEEE!  No joke.  I've been to so many all-you-can-eat sushi places and tons of Japanese restaurants in my lifetime that I feel confident saying that Goyemon has one of the best sushi's in the States.  This would probably be a whole different story if I've been to Japan, but that has yet been crossed off my bucket list.  In the meantime, this place is my #1 spot.  So why do I love this place?  Although Goyemon currently has 4 stars according to Yelp, I feel that it depicts this place so wrongly.  It should receive 5 1/2 stars. That's how great it is.  Being Asian and all, I have come to love rice.  White, brown, sticky, broken...I LOVE rice, just ask the boyfriend.  When it comes to sushi, the way the rice is prepared makes all the difference in the world.  Trust me, I know.  If the rice is too sticky, you'll be sitting there all day chewing on sticky rice.  If there's too much rice vinegar then the sushi rice just falls apart once chopsticks come in contact with it.  This place does it right.  They \"cut\" the rice in such a way that it's one with the sashimi/raw fish.  The portion between the fish itself as well as the sushi rice is perfect.  Some places either put so much more rice hoping it'd fill you up faster, but that just takes away all the trust a customer has in the restaurant as well as the sushi chef.    Bomb dynamite.  A lot of sushi places are starting to add rice at the bottom of these delectable appetizers, but it's really taking away the taste of this delicious dish.  Goyemon thankfully doesn't do that.   Mussels.  Can't go to a sushi restaurant without getting mussels...   If they ever provide this option as a part of the all-you-can-eat-deal, then I say get it.  This is the salmon belly.  What's great about it is, is that it's very much like salmon, it just melts so much more in your mouth.  You've got to try it if you can.    And the one fish I can never cheat on, white tuna.  My absolute favorite.   Generally at all-you-can-eat places I leave a little room for dessert.  Goyemon's lychee sorbet dessert is one of a kind (to me).  It's not your regular sorbet, a little bit more on the sticky side as if you were chewing on mochi, but not as chewy as mochi.  That may not make any sense, but in a way it melts nicely in your mouth, sort of like soft, snow that is just falling down.   If you plan to eat there, make sure to head there early in the day right before they open.  It's a little slow at first, but it quickly gets busy 15-30 minutes later.  It's so packed, people are just waiting out the door.  What's even more interesting is that the location isn't even that great.  It's a little off the strip (15 minutes away), but I love that about it.  It attracts locals and very few tourists go out there so you aren't bombarded by tourists even though you may considered as one.   Already missin' you....  Lina Chen",

The last few times we went it was pretty slow, and service was slow. The time between our food just takes forever.   The last time we went, the server messed up the order as well. We ordered a full Sexy girl roll and half a moon roll. They came out with half a sexy girl roll and half of a random roll.   The only reason why I put it as 4 stars instead of 3 was because of all the dessert options. I love desserts, too! I'm getting really disappointed with Goyemon. It might be a while before I go back there.",

All jokes aside, I really enjoyed dinner here. The choices were wonderful for AYCE. I love that it's not set up like a buffet; instead, you order rolls/nigiri/items from the grill/desserts with your server. Be mindful of what you order so you don't end up with a lot of leftovers; they'll most likely charge you extra for wasting food. You can order 1/2 a roll so you can still enjoy different sushi rolls without getting too full to try everything else or end up wasting food. I saw that there's a time limit of 60 mins for AYCE on the menu... not sure how strictly they enforce it though. We were in an out within an hour. Everything we ordered was really good.  Great service. Parking lot shared with other businesses in the same shopping center. Open til 3 AM (crazy!) Check out daily specials on the chalkboard that you can also order if you're doing AYCE.",

    "text": "Came here for an AYCE sushi lunch after hiking at Red Rock.  AYCE lunch is $21.95 and dinner is $26.95.  I think the main difference is that you can't order sweet shrimp or uni for lunch unless you want to pay the dinner price.  It was so easy for us to get our money's worth here, and the quality was great for AYCE sushi!  They have a huge menu filled with nigiri, specialty rolls, appetizers, and dessert.  One caveat, you have to finish EVERYTHING or else they'll charge you a la carte prices.  Do not leave the rice behind.  The nigiri we ordered: -  Super white tuna (ono) x6 - my favorite!  We ordered 6 orders of this.   -  Salmon x3 - it was ok; kind of mushy. -  Seared salmon x1 - good sear, brought out the flavors/oils of the salmon. -  Albacore x1 - good -  Yellowtail x3 - very fresh. -  Unagi x3 - good  The rolls we ordered (the great thing is - you can order HALF orders so you can try more varieties!!) - they were also really generous with the raw fish they put in the rolls: -  Moon roll x1 - if you like unagi, get this. -  Lemon roll x2 - our favorite!!  if you like yellowtail and salmon with a citrus ponzu sauce, get this. -  Supreme salmon roll x1 - if you like salmon on salmon, get this -  Dragon roll x1 - if you like unagi, get this. -  Volcano roll x2 - if you like baked scallops and mayo, get this -  Moment roll x1 - if you like crunchy rolls, get this -  Chubby roll x1 - if you like shrimp tempura, avocado, and salmon with a slight kick wrapped in a gargantuan roll, get this.  Sides: -  Vegetable tempura - came with 5 pcs - I got carrot, sweet potato, onion, asparagus, and green bean. -  Miso soup - watered down.  We didn't have room for dessert, but they had red bean ice cream, green tea ice cream, tempura ice cream, and ice cream mochis on the menu when we came.    We came so hungry, and left SO stuffed.  I can't believe we ate all this between 2 people.  Totally got our money's worth though!",

I had:  - Tuna poke (small but delicious)  - Domingo Roll (tasted like sushi with nachos or salsa)  - Super White Tuna (tasted like butter!!)  - Seaweed Salad (small but delicious) - Chocolate Mousse",

For just a small place, very slow and had to check to make sure our orders were coming. Not very attentive either. Once we placed our first order, had to flag a server down to order again.",

The pork is always so juicy and fatty, while the albacore and tuna taste so fresh and perfectly salty.  Con: they dont take reservations so be prepared to wait, whether its for lunch or dinner.",

    "text": "Came here 7 hrs ago and I'm still so full!! AYCE for lunch is until 4pm for $21 per person- so worth it!! The only downside is that you have a 45 min limit, but it was plenty of time for me to get stuffed. If you have a fairly small party (we came with four people), I highly recommend sitting at the bar. You get your food a lot faster so you can eat more =P AND if you get nice sushi chef like Gian, he will recommend different things for you to try!   We got yellowtail, salmon, halibut, eel, and some rolls as well. First of all, rolls usually come in 8 pieces per order but for most of them, you can request half orders. It's nice because it saves you room to try a variety rather than just a few. I also got a crunchy hand roll- but you can pretty much customize it however you want, just ask :) As for nigiri that we ordered, fish is very good quality and they give you a reasonable amount of rice. My favorite was the yellowtail, I probably had 10 pieces of that by myself if not more! Halibut was also good and that was chef's recommendation, wouldn't have gotten it other wise. They also have a good selection of sides that you can order. From calamari to gyoza to miso soup to seaweed salad and many more- you get the point. I enjoyed all the sides that I tried except maybe edamame. I liked that it's hot but it's too buttery to my liking. Moving on to desserts...omg all you can eat dessert too???? We got mochi ice cream, tempura ice cream and 3 scoops of red bean, lychee and green tea ice cream. Needless to say, we were all stuffed!!!!  This place was worth every penny and definitely will be back again! Unfortunately I was so busy stuffing my face I didn't take any pictures =\\ meh oh well. Until next time! =D",

Quality was great and food came out in a timely manner. Soda and water refills were handled quickly which is a huge thing for my husband. I like the large selection of rolls WITHOUT crab salad. I don't like mayo so this is a huge plus and hard to find at most sushi places. For dessert we had fried ice cream and chocolate mousse. I wish I had ordered two of each because my husband doesn't usually like dessert and he ate most of them! Being so late I was ready to head home so decided not to order more.   Only dislike is the seating. It's such a small space and you sit soooo close to people, feels like you are almost joining them/vice versa. This time we sat in a corner so we had a little bit more privacy than when we have sat with people on all sides.   Overall we had a great time and will come back!!",

My boyfriend and I decided to try this place after seeing very good reviews and pictures about the quality of the sushi here. For AYCE sushi I would expect shitty quality for sushi but nah I was wrong. Their menu was so extensive for all you can eat! And the crazy thing about it is its $25 per person! So you have to come very hungry to eat the all you can eat.   Service was decent. We didn't really need a server since we sat at the sushi bar but the sushi chef was okay. He was very attentive and helpful about choosing the sushi. Plus sitting at the sushi bar for all you can eat is a good thing because you get more attention and you get your food right away.   Overall, my experience was great. I haven't been to an AYCE sushi place since I last been to Las Vegas. They need to open one in Houston!",

I live in Seattle now, but since my parents still live here I still come to visit ALL the time. And each time, I'm like \"maybe I should try a new sushi place\" and I do! But then, they never quite stack up to Goyemon.   Here's the thing, I don't think that Goyemon has the best side dishes. Maybe not even rolls. But if you're a raw fish or a nigiri lover like me --- Goyemon is the place for you. By far the freshest tasting raw fish I've had at an AYCE place.  ---albacore and salmon on point. As any sushi restaurant should. So fresh. And doesn't overdo it with the rice. Omg. ---fresh scallop melts in your mouth and has a hint of lemon. Omg. ---halibut has a slightly thicker texture like squid so it has the perfect amount of chewiness while not being overwhelming. Omg. ---super white tuna is just so melty and wonderful. Not overly fishy. Perfect. Omg.  I'm like dying. Can someone just take me to this sushi restaurant already?  As for rolls I like to get: -sunrise bc it has so much flavor to it. It's not heavy. It has a light citrus taste to it, and you can really taste all of the ingredients including the rawfish. -Goyemon style lasagna bc I like to eat some heavy food too. I like variety and if you get a half roll of this, the melted cream cheese isn't overwhelming. -sexy girl if you're a shrimp tempura person, this one's a goodie.  This place is BOMB. You won't regret it.",

They sat us knowing we have a party of 3 since that's the first thing they ask, and our 3rd person was 2 mins away. As soon as the server walks in, the first thing she asks was if we had a 3rd person instead of greeting us. And proceeded to tell us that until our 3rd person arrives she cannot seat us, when we were already seated. Mind you there were tables right next to us who were parties of 2 who were seated at table that were meant for bigger parties, and then I saw them sit a couple who still had to wait on their friends. Way to lose loyal customers who were just looking to eat some food and have a goodnight. Instead was spoiled by a \"policy\" that they choose to enforce when they want to. I would love to give negative stars, unfortunately I cannot. From the hostess to the server and the manager, service was just bad and unorganized. We all have one job to do in customer service and that's to keep CUSTOMERS HAPPY! Unfortunately, that is not something that was attempted this evening, and as a result, this establishment will no longer be recommended nor frequented by myself or my many associates.",

    "text": "One of the best AYCE sushi places that I have been to so far. The fish was fresh and that's important as not all AYCE places serve the freshest fish. This is one of the very few gems that do but before you come here, be prepared to put your name on the list with your phone number so they can text you when your table is ready! It's pretty awesome.   The wait. Up to 2 hours if they're busy but I tell you what.. It's totally worth it. You can pretty much order anything and everything from the several menus plopped on the table. There's quite a few selections so look through them carefully. From appetizers to side dishes to the nigiri, rolls and desserts. It really is a True all encompassing AYCE experience where everything can be ordered. I did notice that the uni and amaebi nigiri can only be ordered once.  My favorite thing of all was actually not the sushi (that's not to say the sushi wasn't good) but the pork belly appetizer which was incredibly fattening, moist and insanely well flavored. If you like Salmon, the Salmon belly is available and sampled both the standard and the belly. If you like fatty and tasty fish, I wholeheartedly recommend the belly. It's got so much flavor! The uni was fresh and quite tasty.  Service was good and efficient. Being that it was me and my brother's first time there, we were kindly informed about the whole process. Our waiter was patient and answered all our questions and we had a few! By the end of the night, we were so full, we still opted for desserts. So yeah, try to pace yourself. Don't just order everything at once. Order in waves!  We came here during EDC week and this place was packed and with good reason. Service is good and so is the food. For $27 per person for dinner, this place is hard to beat and I look forward to coming here whenever I make Vegas my next stop.",

Yet Goyemon bucks that trend and I have to say that it was pretty darn good, and even better for less than $30 bucks!  Who has uni on an all you can eat menu...crazy right!? And the best part, it was pretty damn good and fresh. The maguro but decent, and well...tuna, so it definitely didn't disappoint. The salmon was pretty damn fresh and full of flavor. The dynamite definitely packed some punch and be sure to check out the items on the specials menu.   While we waited a long time for a table at 10:00 pm, we definitely didn't wait long for our food to arrive. We sat at the bar and were able to watch our order made in front of us. Also, felt inspired to try a few new things that were being made for other parties.   Location is definitely a bit away from the strip, but well worth the journey. Set in a strip mall, parking wasn't exactly in short supply.   Was it worth the journey and the hype? Yeah, I would definitely give it another go!",

This place is an All-you-can-eat Japanese buffet restaurant. You can however, order off the menu ala-carte, but I've never seen anybody actually do that.   First off, understand that this place DOES NOT take reservations, it is strictly a first come first serve basis. Secondly, understand that they have very limited seating. At most 50-70 people would be a overestimate from what i could observe.  Thirdly, understand that all your sushi and dishes are prepared on the spot for you. Basically you place your order with the waitress and the sushi chef will prepare your sushi on the spot for you. It is a small kitchen and fourthly, understand that your food might take a while to arrive at your table.   The food here, however, is one of the best value for money sushi restaurants in town.  Each individual sushi is probably half the size of what you would normally see outside, so take note, although the size of the sushi does not determine its quality. Every single sushi is prepared for the freshness, from the ingredients to the sushi rice, everything is of a high quality. The quality of the sushi here definitely beats those found in the international buffets at Caesars Palace or the Wynn.   The choice of raw fish is extensive, they have all the common sushi you can find at most sushi joints in the states, from salmon, tuna, albacore, white tuna, octopus, scallops, sweet shrimps and even Uni(sea urchin). The number of special rolls is off the charts. So many different types to choose from. Even the desserts like the tempura ice cream can be found here.  Why spend 50 dollars a person at a regular sushi joint if you are a hardcore sushi lover when you can spend half of that eating to your hearts content at this place?  Just come earlier with an empty stomach and you will leave a happy and satisfied person.",

Our server was not too kind, and she seemed reluctant to take our order when ever we wanted more food.  We did the all you can eat dinner which is $26.95 per person.  The menu is vast, with so much variety.  Every roll you could possibly want is on here.  I would also like to add that the grilled menus are also part of the all you can eat menu.  That part was not clearly written on the menu.  Keep in mind that the grilled items are good, but tiny, only coming in one or two pieces.  They limit the amount certain premium fish you are allowed to order, such as uni.    Our server was really anal about making sure we ate all the rice from the sashimi.  We wanted to order more because we knew it would take time for the items to come out from the kitchen.  But before she took down our order, she noticed we still had some pieces we had not finished yet.  She decided she would take on the roll of the Rice Police and yell at us to finish our food.  Lady, we did not ask you to the plate away.  Don't assume.  You make an ASS out of U and ME.    Anyways, I would like to reiterate that the food was good.  The service, not so much.  I would definitely recommend this place just because they are open so late, and have a lot of food to choose from.",

Soups, salads, tempura, sashimi, nigiri, desserts, specials and many more.   I would definitely recommend to anyone to try it and get addicted just like me. Timmay is excellent and the rest of the staff are amazing.   Prepare to wait, they don't take reservations.

    "text": "DO NOT EAT HERE! ---- Yes, I just said that - DO NOT EAT HERE!  Over the years, I have posted positive things about Sushi House Goyemon! We have eaten here MANY MANY MANY times - have recommended Goyemon as the best of Vegas to MANY MANY MANY people. However, they don't care anymore.  We went in for lunch and several times they tried pushing us into dinner prices ... then the sushi started to come - extremely small pieces of fish with very large amounts of rice. The rolls looked sloppy and drenched in sauce. I asked the waitress and she said our chef was new - OK, maybe he shouldn't be preparing food yet ... so be it, then more slop arrived - I called over a \"manager\" to show him. He said they do not have a General Manager, there was no boss and there was no way to contact anyone anymore with all their locations. However, he said he would try to locate a number for me to follow-up with.  I went to the bathroom and was even more bothered - the bathroom has gratify in it that was there a year ago (with profanity in Spanish). I asked this \"manager\" about it and he said the management don't follow-up on anything (if your bathroom is not clean, then you have to wonder about the kitchen). He said he would have someone contact me, but my best bet would be to write a review and they would see it. Well, we have posted good Yelp reviews in the past ... sure, I could tell of my True recent experiences.  Not receiving the phone call that I was promised, I commented on an ad that popped up on my timeline (FB). I said \"when was this picture taken, it was not recently based on my experience\". Someone commented and asked if this was correct - so I posted a picture of our food. Sushi House Goyemon removed the picture and comment AND blocked me. Blocked me? Why not reply and say \"sorry you had a problem\" - no, blocked me. I can't revise my 5star review as I get this message \"You are blocked You are not allowed to rate or review the Page because you are blocked by the Page admin.\" DO NOT EAT HERE - the pictures on this page are not accurate ... food, quality and service are pathetic.",

We ended up getting seats at the sushi bar and ordered AYCE. Good selection of different rolls and many of them could be ordered as half-rolls. They also had sides such as tempura veggies, pot stickers and small servings of poke. I tried the poke and the pot stickers. I tried a couple of their baked rolls and I usually order whatever unagi dishes sushi places have. All the rolls I had were good as well as the tempura and pot stickers. The staff was friendly and service was good. The sushi chefs got our meals out in a timely manner and even lightly joked around with us.   As for the building itself, it was nicely and tastefully decorated; inviting and warm but not distracting. It was a good first-time experience and I will come back soon.",

I am usually skeptical of all you can eat sushi since often times the quality and selection will suffer.  This is absolutely not the case at Goyemon.  Their nigiri menu is the typical selections, but they have a huge number of very inventive and tasty rolls.  Their version of the 911 roll is the spiciest I have had anywhere since they add habanero pepper as well as the typical chili sauce.  Another pleasant surprise for their all you can eat menu is that there are items available from the grill.  I have had the grilled yellowtail and pork belly and both were very tasty.  The service has always been good with multiple servers handling each table which makes it go much quicker with a large group doing AYCE.

    "text": "I was invited to eat out by several of my co-workers, all who of which are Japanese.  I first asked if they had eaten at Goyemon prior to our visit, which they confirmed that they had, multiple times.  So that was my first indication that this place wouldn't be too shabby.  We arrived at a modestly decorated space with a fifteen minute wait for six people at 1AM on a Friday night.  The interior has mood lighting, with a gorgeous, clean bathroom and an overall generic but pleasant decor.    To get a good sampling of what the restaurant offered, I decided to spend the 26.95 to get the AYCE which isn't just sushi, but included all kitchen food, entrees, and dessert.  That way, if the sushi was mediocre, I could pig out on entrees and kitchen food.    Thankfully, that was not the case as the sushi was pretty good.  I ended up eating a lot of the Americanized rolls which as a whole I generally don't care for, but every once in a while I do end up finding a roll that has a ton of goobledegook on it and enjoying it.  I for one like my sushi to be light and have a distinctly smooth taste to it.  So this place worked for me.  I had two orders of shumai (steamed/fried), gyoza, eight half orders of sushi, 1/2 order of ramen, and Green Tea Cake, the latter of which was my favorite part of the meal.  And yes, you read that prior part right: You can do half orders of sushi, which I loved, since this gave you the ability to a variety of sushi rather than get stuck with a roll that was so-so in your ranking.    In terms of sushi: Sexy Girl, Cynthia, and Dragon all stood out for me.    The only thing I really didn't care for was the service.  It started off fantastic.  Speedy, tons of refills on my iced green tea.  And then, towards the end, I was waiting and waiting and waiting to get a refill of water.  The staff was pleasant, and the food was good, very good for an AYCE.",

The nigiri is what I would go for. The tuna here isn't the best. (Especially after eating  the Toro sushi at Angotei, but I didn't expect much from it since it is ayce). Salmon is really good though. I would avoid the Seared Tuna nigiri at all cost. I expected them to sear it on the spot, but I received the fish cold and hard. Nothing compared to Tokyo Table seared garlic tuna.   This deal includes desserts as well. The green tea creme brulee is alright. The flavoring just doesn't seem right. I prefer a regular creme brulee over this one. However, the mochi is good, but how could you go wrong with that? Green tea and red bean ice cream are good as expected.",

Be warned, this place does get extremely busy at night, so if you're coming in with a party, be warned you're probably going to have to wait for a bit.  Non-sushi wise, I also like pretty much everything that comes off their grill.  The cajun salmon is just delicious, excellently spiced with just a little bit of kick from the pepper.  You can't go wrong with the pork belly either, it's just a rich piece of meat with really good and smooth flavors.  It usually has a great mouth feel to it as well.  And finally, the super white tuna, it's just delicious, little sweet, but very well balanced.  Now for the chili-heads out there, this place can hook you up if you want some heat.  The 9-1-1 roll can definitely get your taste buds going, and if you want it spicier, just tell them to add more of the habanero sauce.  They can also kick most of their rolls up another notch if you ask them too.",

We did not do the all you can eat so we just ordered alot of random stuff. The ones i remembered for sure was the Pork belly dish that was amazing. And the super white grilled tuna was another of my favorites. 58$ for two people with tip. and thats without the AYCE price which is 26$ a person. The staff is good and the service is quick.",

They have so many delicious rolls to choose from as well as many non-sushi items included in the AYCE.",

However, if you're not a sushi snob (cause let's face it, if you're looking for bargain fish you ain't gettin unlimited A-grade stuff) and hate spending $18 per roll (I'm looking at you, Yellowtail @ Bellagio), then this may be the place for you.   Take my advice and take a look at the pics on Yelp before you go so you have an idea of the first few things you'd like to try.  I didn't and went into panic mode when it came time to ordering.  Nothing's worse than sitting at the sushi bar and furiously scanning the double-sided menu and going, \"....ummm....uh....er.....\" while the uber-busy sushi chef is waiting for you to respond.  I have to admit that after a while I just stuck to ordering whatever the stranger next to me ordered, cause he seemed like a regular. Thanks random stranger for not calling me out on copying your style!  You were right on point with the sashimi salad.",

All U Can Eat is a bargain considering the quality of the fish.  They also do some interesting roles, but order 1/2 roles so you can keep enjoying the variety. Goyemon gets crowded at times, but it's worth it; sitting at the bar is fine.  This is the best A-U-C-E that we've had...anywhere.",

Yeah there is a long line sometimes but it worth the wait  The side orders are my favorite. I always get me miso with shrimp heads, green mussel, steamed goyza, pork belly, and my favorite GRILLED VEGGIES!! YUM  This place is a MUST if you have loving for sushi.

Maybe because the host was extremely welcoming and eager to seat us even though it was jam packed at 5:30pm on a Sunday and did so within the first 10 mins of arrival. We, among several groups were told 30-45 or even 45-60min waits, but we just got lucky with the bar. Our first server was quick and so was out busser... But like many other AYCE joints, once the first order or two has been taken, they don't come around anymore. Our chef seemed disgruntled the entire time as he served our sad sad looking nigiri. Barely any of it stayed intact when it was picked up. He seemed better at forming rolls. All the food tasted fine, but could the presentation just at least be ALMOST decent? (See pictures below) can't complain about dessert since Mochi ice cream is pre-made. The bf ordered the tempura ice cream which would have been great except it took four, I say FOUR waiters to bring a spoon that the tempura was already soggy. He was still kind enough to tip generously where I admit I might've not been so kind. Other than that, the place looks clean. The decor is inviting. Beyond that, I can't say anymore.",

    "text": "4.5 stars  Dined here for the first time tonight with the family, and I gotta say this place trumps sushi mon as the best AYCE sushi joint in Las Vegas. And that's saying a lot, because I've been been a big fan and a regular of Sushi Mon for the past six years. However, at the end of the night, I get a stamp card (buy 10 ACYEs and get one free), and it has Sushi Mon's  E. Sahara location on it as well. I came to the conclusion that Sushi House Goyemon has the same owner?  I was impressed with the quality of the fish and the relatively small portion of rice that came with the nigiri. Many ACYE places give huge portions of rice and miniscule pieces of fish. I may be exaggerating a bit, but you know what i mean. The ploy of most of these places is to get you full quicker by giving you bigger chunks of rice. Not at Goyemon.  Some of my highlights: -Uni nigiri (very fresh) -Since I'm a huge fan of spicy tuna, I have to try every sushi joint's spicy tuna roll. The spicy tuna had a tarty/sour kick to it giving it a very exotic flavor, which I thoroughly enjoyed -Crispy Rice Roll (Fried Cali Roll with spicy tuna on top drizzled with eel sauce and spicy mayo) - Seared tuna (perfectly seared and very fresh tuna) - Hirame sushi (delicate, melted in my mouth) - Green Tea Cake (creamy and not too sweet) - Lychee ice cream (Heaven)  I deducted 0.5 stars, because we had to wait about 15-20 minutes for the rest of our sushi and rolls to come out. However, the restaurant was packed, so it was understandable. Our waitress apologized to us several times. (She was also very nice and pretty :)",

I will say that there is sometimes worry that these AYCE sushi places pack on the rice and skimp on the fish to get you full off the starch, but I didn't find this was the case here.

That was the last time I fully enjoyed this place. It used to be my favorite sushi spot in Vegas.  AYCE is the way to go when dining at Goyemon. Tried the seared salmon salad and it was delicious but a little too much dressing for my taste.  Specialty rolls galore. I'd have to say my favorite is the Sexy Girl.  Salmon skin hand roll was blah, no flavor but the right amount of gobo.  It's nice because they do do half rolls. I took my bff from Boston here yesterday and sat next to a couple who ordered many times but all half rolls. Smart couple.   I LOVE their spicy tuna rice cracker but unfortunately it's only on their dinner menu.  Pork belly is hit or miss for me there (also only on the dinner menu). I love it when it's super tender but have had orders when it's more on the chewy or burnt side. Bff and I ordered nigiri which I don't normally order.  We did enjoy the garlic tuna, super white was OK, she enjoyed the cajun albacore. I was sad that my green tea ice cream which I always look forward to was half melted by the time I got it and BFF didn't expect her tempura ice cream to be soggy as opposed to the crunchy outside she expected :(  The reason I didn't give a 5 star rating as I would've last year is that the service went downhill. I remember staff being more attentive with filling my water and more friendly upon entering the restaurant.  Might be a while before I make another visit...",

    "text": "This place has so much potential and would definitely get 5 stars if it wasn't for the average service and shortage of servers and sushi chefs.  I was in Vegas with my family plus family friends about 3 weeks ago. My dad had wanted to try this one sushi place my aunt recommended. After searching through Yelp, we decided to go Sushi House Goyemon instead of our original dinner plans because of the high rating on Yelp.   Since we had a larger party (about 15 people), we waited a little bit over 30 min. Most of us did the AYCE which was $26.95/person (no discounted price for children). The menu is HUGE! They had so many appetizers, salads, rolls, sashimi, and desserts to choose from on the AYCE menu. I was impressed and wish I could have tried them all. They had a lot of items that I usually only see on the regular menus that are not for AYCE. Since it was a while ago that I went, I can't remember them all... but some that popped out were grilled yellowtail collarbone, cold tofu, wakame (seaweed salad), green tea creme brulee... just to name a few. The sashimi was so fresh!! DROOOOOL! it makes me hungry just to think about it! hahaha  Although the food selection was great, the service was so so slooooooooow. Half of my party got full just from waiting for the rest of their food to come out and ended up not eating that much. It seemed like they forgot some of our food so we would ask them to check up on it. As a result, we got double of our order, which is a plus except when you don't feel like an having an excessive amount of the same thing. There were 4 servers the night I came, but only two sushi chefs for a full house?? The delicious desserts kind of helped compensate for the wait and they let us stay longer than the 1 hour maximum sit time.  I would try this place again but with a smaller party.",

    "text": "This is 2 years later. Before you read my review I'd like to point out some things. I'm not a complainer, not hard to please, I'm very easy going, I don't think first impression is everything, I give multiple chances, and I'm so understanding. Even when I find hair in my food, I don't even complain or tell the server. Now that we got that out of the way and you know what type of consumer I am, lets continue with why I went from giving this place 5 stars to 2 stars.   I had been going to goyemon for few years loyally since it first opened. Introduced multiple friends and family to trying there. My boyfriend and I ate here regularly, at least once a week and we always did AYCE, I did couple a la carte for lunch to go. Quality and cleanliness were over the top. Waiting up to an hour or more for dinner everytime was always worth it. The service was always so amazing. Until recently, I had a (new) server that got sassy with me one visit, didn't say anything. Went back couple more times after that and the service and food kept going down hill. Servers were not as attentive and it seems to be almost a new crew except for some that has been there awhile. One bus boy was awesome, don't know his name and the sushi chefs are cool too. Apri, the hostess is sweet. Other than those mentioned, None of the other servers have any personality.   Last time my boyfriend and I ate here (which we almost went back for one last chance a week later but decided to go to our other favorite sushi place. More on that later) I was so disgusted by how dirty everything was and the quality of the food. The plate of wasabi and ginger had dried  up food still stuck on it (somehow, the server missed that putting wasabi and ginger on it). I scraped it off and let it go. More plates came with food, all the plates had dried up food still stuck on them. My beer glass had lip stains around the rim. I didn't say a damn thing about any of those dirty dishes. Food came, everything had smaller portions than before. All the nigiris had a tiny piece of fish on them. Amount of food from side dishes were cut in half. I get it, it's AYCE smaller the portion the more you can eat or less food you may waste. But what the restaurant started with and what people grew to love should be priority and that's the quality of the food, that went down hill. I'm so disappointed, I'd love to still go there but after all the past experiences the last few visits we won't be going back ever again. Umiya is closer and has always been our other favorite when goyemon is too busy or when we don't want to make the drive. The quality of the food is amazing. The servers actually have personality and actually acknowledge the fact that you're a regular. Way better vibe.   So there is my first \"negative\" review. Management : whoever is running goyemon now needs to prioritize before you start losing more customers. Clean your dishes.",

    "text": "I want to give this restaurant more stars but service today was just terrible. If I could I would give them 3.5.  We have visited this place at least 5 times now. Usually for dinner.   To start the food is good. Fish is not fishy at all. Most Ayce places don't have good quality fish but this place stands out. Their pork belly is pretty amazing as well.  Now of course this place isn't better than a la carte places like soho and other places that you might find on the strip. But if you are looking for ayce this is the place to go.   Trust me it's not perfect nigiri pieces are smaller like cut in half per order, also their rice is a little hard for me. But still we come here because the taste is pretty good. They also have a lot of good hot food options. Like their baked mussels is a must as well as the garlic edamame.   So why the 3 stars?? Ok so usually when we go here we do have to flag down a server to order more food, not sure if they do that on purpose so we don't order more?? And the food does come out slow. But today was just the worst. We got food before we got our waters ! And then the server forgot the hot tea so I had to be the annoying person and have my hand up to get her attention. We saw several of our dishes go to the table next to us. And then when we asked about it she said it's on the way. We got our second round of orders before we got our missing shumai and edamame ( first order). My bf seriously loves their  garlic edamame so he was getting a little hAngry  and annoyed with the server. When we got the edamame it was regular edamame and not garlic,  so now we are just mad. I ordered 4 orders of yellowtail nigiri and one toro. We got at our table one yellowtail and one tuna. I figured she just messed up the order but turns out it was someone else's order. Then I saw them run our 4 orders of salmon belly to the table next to us again! ( seems to be the theme of the day). We over heard tables on both side of us complaining that they were missing orders. So it wasn't just us imagining things. The lady from the other table orders ice cream before me. They gave me her order of ice cream by mistake. Every time we ordered food there was some sort of mix up even down to the dessert.   We spent a lot time waiting. Waiting to get our drinks. Waiting to order. Waiting for our food. Waiting for refills. The only thing we didn't wait for was the check.   I like this place and hope that the next time our  experience is better and I will be sure to update my review",

Their service is garbage, noting at our table when seated not even a waiter at our table. We have to ask for one. You guys shouldn't even have that room that you guys so call VIP.  Second reason, food quality this time was horrible. Fish tasted like it was sitting out for hours instead of keeping it well maintained and fresh. Main Reason, we was trying to ordering again but no server or waiter around for at least 15 mins so we didn't want to wait another dam minute for them to show up, no refills on drinks also, these guys are running a circus here. I had to get up from my own seat and ask for my check. If yelp was able to give 0 stars you guys would tottally get one. But 1 start for noting because 0 stars isn't optional here.",

Also found the hamachi and the cajun albacore (<a href=\"http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/JyxHvtj-syke7m9rbza7mA?select=hhmo9Y-ZKcA8Bd-UvtDJTA#hhmo9Y-ZKcA8Bd-UvtDJTA\">yelp.com/biz_photos/JyxH...</a>) to be just as delicious. The cajun albacore was an interesting dish considering you won't find it at most sushi places, but definitely had a smoky, spiced up flavor that matched well with the fish.   Can't really go wrong with what you order, just don't order a lot of rolls with a lot of rice or fillers, cause it does fill you up quickly. Then comes the dessert, mochi, lychee and other fruit sorbets, ice cream, and tempura fried ice cream. If you're an ice cream person, this might be worth the whole price tag of the lunch or dinner itself. Enjoy!",

Holy Nigiri!!!  I don't think we can eat at our AYCE place at home. This place puts it to shame.    Andre is an amazing sushi chef.   Friendly, fast, and fills you up with great food.   The menu is overwhelming in the most positive way.  I'm not a fan of salmon, so on any rolls I wanted with salmon, he switched it for any fish of my choice.   This place is open til 3a, and the mood here is fun and festive.   For people that often complain of fish sizing in ratio to rice, this is your place - good cuts of fish with small amounts of rice.    service is awesome here too.  Wait list?  No problem.  They text you and you have 5-10 minutes to get back, where your table is ready.    I cannot compliment this place enough.  They must have 25 options of nigiri and 50 different rolls.    They got hot rolls also and the Baked 428, is BOMB!    And probably the highest point, they will make you half rolls.  It allows you to sample more rolls, and this is important for my wife.",

Super White Tuna: So fresh with the right amount of sauce/seasoning. Could have only had this for the whole meal and been satisfied!   The waitress was attentive and understanding.

Last night that memory was completely shattered. When ordering the nigiri I was appalled at how inconsistent the fish was cut and the fact that the rice was horrible. They know more practice the art of making a quality product, the evidence to that is a machine that lays out the rice for them so I can slap a piece of cheap nori on it and turned into a very substandard role.  You might think I'm being somewhat of a snob or a total dick to this place, but after having worked for three years in high end Japanese cuisine and seeing what is possible and also eaten at several other aw IC e.

This time, we came at an odd hour (3:30PM) on a Saturday and were luckily able to get seated for 10 people without issue.  Note, NOT everyone in your party has to eat AYCE, which I was surprised to hear.  This worked out great for us.  Everything we ordered was amazingly fresh and tasty.  Definitely not the cheap sh*t. Love the ton of options and the grean tea creme brulee was a nice touch to end it all.  Service was also attentive and quick.  However,  the sushi to rice ratio is not that great here, but the freshness kind of makes up for it.  Just looked at my thumb and that's about how much rice you get per sushi (I have a medium sized thumb).  The fish on top is just a small sliver.  While I liked this place a lot compared to the other 4-5 AYCE sushi places I've tried in Vegas, there's still another AYCE sushi place in Vegas I enjoy a tad bit more.  A better sushi to rice ratio and even more options make me like that place more.  Check out my reviews to find out which one.  Hence, 4 rightfully deserved yelp stars from me, Goyemon.",

    "text": "We came here at around 11:30 on a Monday to beat the crowds, and we're pretty glad we came early (they open at 11:45) because very soon after we got seated, the entire restaurant was already full. They say that the maximum time you can spend here is 45 minutes, but I don't think they enforce it because the food came out very slowly for us. They have a huge selection of rolls, sashimi, and appetizers. You can order as much as you want, and they then bring it to you. Nothing really stood out to me, but I really enjoyed the dessert selection-- green tea ice cream, lychee ice cream, red bean ice cream, and strawberry/vanilla mochi. Mmmm. I think I ate more than I spent and got my money's worth. I'd come back to this place.",

    "text": "Worst sushi place ever!  I came in last night with my friend and husband. We usually come in every month but this time we will never return.    Normally, when your eating in a sushi place, the first thing everyone notice is the food, service, and waiting time.   The food was horrible. I come to a sushi place to eat fish not rice. I only ate the nigiri because there wasn't much good selections on rolls. The nigiri was a disappointment. All the fish had humongous rice and the fish was not pressed down properly. Once you see the rice portion is bigger than the fish than that is an insult.    So we complained about it to our server. He said he'll talk to the manager. The server came back and said I'm sorry we CAN'T do anything about it. The manager didn't have the balls to stop by our table and talk to us. The manager has seen us a few times and he knows we tip 30% or more. Back then, the manager usually greet us and takes our table. Last time he offered comp bottle of sake but this time he acted like he barely knew us. Anyhow, we ordered a few more to see if they would fix the problem but instead the rice gets bigger every time and the cut of fish just gets smaller. We are not asking for them to put extremely less rice but balance out the portion of the fish to the rice.  Over all the server/manager sucks. Poor customer service.    Waiting time was great. There was no line, finally. Usually, goyemon is always packed and i would wait 30 mins to an hour to be seated. Thats how much I use to love goyemon. It use to be worth the wait.      Food came out on time as expected. But our server was always missing. Server just clears out our table and runs away. We always have to wait or ask the attentive host to call our server. So ordering was a pain.   Overall 1 star is what they deserve.  Goyemon you just LOST 3 valuable customers.",

    "text": "Wherever you go, there you are.  After several years, Sushi House Goyemon still has it! All-you-can-eat sushi is its own category. I would typically rather pay more for less sushi of a better quality than AYCE, but a few times each year I inevitably end up in an AYCE joint. Goyemon has been the standard for a while now. Recently I ate at a couple other AYCE spots due to convenience and exploration, only to come back to Goyemon with my love when I had AYCE Sushi-loving family in town.  Goyemon's selection of options, quality of product, and freshness of sushi items make them the best in Vegas. Unfortunately, the word has been out for years now and they are very popular. We came in on a weekday at 2pm in the afternoon and experienced a 45 minute wait for a table of 8. The service can also be hit or miss. We started off with attentive service and several rounds of food. The longer we stayed the more active we had to become in order to place the orders we wanted.  I love that Goyemon has a specials board that usually has some premium items on it for sushi as well as for grilled items. In fact, they have one of the largest selections of non-sushi appetizers and small plates for AYCE. If you are a fan of Uni and Ami Ebi, both items can be ordered on the dinner menu, which they will serve at non-dinner hours as long as you are willing to pay dinner pricing.   Whenever I've been in we have always ordered aggressively--starting with a lot and continuing to place orders early on. I have only ever encountered the issue of finishing all the food. I have friends that have complained about difficulties in ordering food or how long it takes for some items to make it out. I can see how this might be an issue, but I also think it can be easily avoided. They have a one hour time-limit, and if they are busy enough to enforce that one-hour limit they will usually asked for your last order with around 15 minutes left. Again, be proactive, keep a general sense of the time and order anything else you might want with about 20 minutes left. They will let you stay a reasonable amount of time to finish your food if you do this and the final orders are brought just before or even after the one hour mark. If you're reactive in life things won't go as well for you...not just in AYCE sushi, but in everything you do...after all, everywhere you go, there you are. I can certainly understand if you would prefer a less hectic, more relaxed setting to enjoy your AYCE sushi, but just know that the sushi won't be as good.  All-you-can-eat is admittedly not my thing. There is no where else I would rather go for AYCE, so is Goyemon deserving of 5 stars?...I don't know...for me I'd rather spend my money at other sushi spots in town that I consider 5 star places.",

    "text": "When I first moved to Vegas, my family and I constantly went to Sushi-mon. Then when we moved away, Goyemon opened so whenever I visited Vegas, I always had to go to Goyemon. It was amazing. It was probably my favorite AYCE sushi place in Vegas.   The sushi was yummy, they always have some type of specials on the board, and they have other things on the menu for non-sushi eaters. So if you were to come with a huge group of people, you can get a mix of things.   One of my FAVORITE items from Goyemon has to be the salmon belly! It is delicious, fatty, and never a disappointment whenever I get it. So why, in heaven's name, did I give it 3 stars? Well ... let me tell you a story.  Goyemon had their 3rd Anniversary Customer Appreciation event and it was supposed to last 2 days. They had a list of special items for those days, which included blue fin and toro. With that, they offered the ability for you to make reservations. My friends and I decided to make a reservation for the 2nd day of the event since the 1st day of the event didn't work out with our schedules.   The excitement built up even more after we found out that on the first day of the event, they did AYCE toro and AYCE uni! OMG! Like, I can't even WAIT.   So when we went in for our reservation, my excitement turns a little bit sour. Why? Well, we had our reservation for 7:30 pm. We get there a little bit early but we have to wait for a table. I'm sorry .. I thought I had a reservation. So what we find out is .. they are still accepting walk ins and because they're typically a walk in restaurant, they don't quite grasp the reservation concept down that well. We actually didn't get seated until maybe at 8 PM.  And then they tell us that there is no AYCE toro tonight, only AYCE uni and waygu beef. Well, gee, thanks. What's the point of having a reservation then? Why would you give AYCE toro one night and not the other night? I wanted to flip multiple tables but since we waited for the table, sat down, and were ready to order, we just stayed.   So my experience from that is just really really sour. So I learned to just walk in on the days they have yummy specials. That way, I won't be missing out REGARDLESS of what they say.   So Goyemon gets an average from me. I still like them and will continue to go to them for AYCE sushi. Service can be slow sometimes though and the servers will look at you funny when you order 20 orders of one thing.   Oh and LOVE their yuzu sorbet (:",

We met up with some friends to dine on their delicious creations.  Since it was AYCE, I was going to take full advantage and try a variety off the menu. It was busy but there were open seats at the bar for immediate seating.  When you sit there, the waitress will handle sides and drinks.  All you have to do it tell the sushi chef's what you'd like. It was pretty great!  They were so quick on our orders and just fun watching them.   I ordered half rolls of the Baked 428, Pete's, Sexy Girl and Frying Jason. The 428 is baked with grilled chicken spread with yum yum sauce, cream cheese, eel sauce and spicy sauce.  Love Love Love this!  I would have been happy with just ordering this.  Can't stop there! Pete's is deep fried sushi with white fish, crab, cream cheese, avocado and eel sauce.  The light texture enveloping this masterpiece from being deep fried made me fall in love with this roll.   Sexy Girl was filled with shrimp tempura, crab and cucumber.  It was then topped with tempura crumb and a spicy garlic sauce which made it totally SEXY! Frying Jason is a baked roll filled with crab, cream cheese, asparagus and avocado topped with spicy yum yum sauce.  Yum Yum indeed!!  I absolutely loved everything I ordered.    I am definitely a fan and will tell anyone who is in the mood for sushi to go here.  Fabulous friends + Fabulous food = Happiness!  Yelp Challenge 2014 (150/365)",

    "text": "So everyone I know RAVES about Goyemon. Whenever someone asks for the \"best sushi\" it is always mentioned. I came to realize this place has the same menu as Sushi Mon. And all the rolls taste the same. So If you LOVE Goyemon, then you should LOVE Sushi Mon too, amirite? I wonder if they are the same owners?  I met my friend Jessie here for lunch on 1/21/16 around 12:30. It was busy, but not packed like it usually around lunch time. It did take us a while for us to receive our food though. This was mildly annoying because I only had an hour for lunch, but in that time I was able to try a decent amount of items:  garlic edamame super white tuna scallops garlic tuna lemon roll lasagna roll domingo roll  The garlic edamame is really good. It doesn't have diced garlic, but rather a subtle garlic flavoring on top of all the beans. The super white tuna was melt in my mouth delicious, and is always one of my favorite nigiri items. I also got to try the scallops and the garlic tuna that Jessie had, both were very good.   The rolls were next. I already love the domingo/lasagna rolls so I knew what to expect and they were delicious. But the lemon roll is definitely a new favorite! It is just a california roll with lemon on top but it's so light and refreshing. I ordered 2 of these but we only got 1 due to time constraints. AYCE also includes dessert but I didn't have time for that either. For AYCE lunch it was reasonably priced at $21.95.",

    "text": "Sushi is my favorite meal and THIS IS MY FAVORITE PLACE EVER!!!  TIPS:  Come for dinner to get the good AYCE menu!! Menu encompasses one order of uni per person. It's nice that not everyone at your table needs to order AYCE.   Came early for dinner to avoid the rush. There's not many tables inside so if you get here later, you'll be waiting a while.  FOOD:  Oh man. So much good nigiri! -- YUMMY Nigiri: Tuna, Uni, Yellowtail, Salmon, Seared salmon, Albacore, Unagi, Fresh scallop aka hotate, Salmon roe aka masago (and we added quail egg on top!), Amaebi aka sweet shrimp (came with the tails, which was a little awkward to eat). They also have a specials menu written on chalkboard so make sure to check that out. We tried the salmon belly, which was a little too fatty for my taste. -- Wasn't a big fan of the Super white tuna   -- I didn't do any of the rolls, because I just wanted all that fresh nigiri!   -- Hand rolls: Salmon skin roll was okay, not much flavor.  DESSERT: Liked the lychee sherbet. Green tea ice cream was okay, I've had (and made) better.  SERVICE: Ugh. Service pretty much sucked here, which is why I'm giving it 4 stars instead of 5. It took foreeeeverrr to get any of our orders and sushi, and the waitresses didn't come to check on us so we had to wave and hunt them down to get more orders in.  Also, the sushi chef made one of my friend's hand rolls wrong TWICE!!! The waitress tried to argue with us until we showed her there was a shrimp inside instead of scallop. I'm really not sure how you mix up scallop and fake crab / shrimp....  OVERALL: I'll be back when I'm in Vegas again! Hopefully the service was just a fluke (the waitress said one of the sushi chefs was new and so that's why it was so slow).",

We ordered 2 adult AYCE lunches. Lunch Total With a coke and Tax: $49.35 (not including tip).  Taste: 3 stars - They are only on the radar by a mere passing grade. Nothing was memorable or great. Everything was either average or not good at all. Even in the beginning of our lunch, we refused to eat one of the rolls we ordered, since it tasted like chemicals and left a foul aftertaste in our mouth. The fish to rice ratio was less than average - the fish cuts were short and thin with a dense ball of rice. In the world of AYCE, Sakana wins the match - they offer a waaaaay better fish to rice ratio, better selection, and more explosive flavors.   The good: 1. Salmon nigiri - slim cuts of salmon, but it will do. The fish tasted sweet and fresh.  2. Halibut nigiri - it wasn't bad, the fish tasted fresh and had a nice texture 3. Yellowtail nigiri - also a sweet and fresh tasting fish 4. Magma roll (half roll/ 4pcs) - we enjoyed this roll. It was simple, but all of the flavors and the texture went together nicely.  5. Miso Soup - we loved how it came out piping hot. It wasn't too salty which is a plus in my book.  6. Lemon roll (half roll/ 4pcs) - it was simple, light and refreshing. Be careful with the lemon slices, some of them were sliced too thick and left a overwhelmingly bitter taste. You might need to just squeeze the lemon. 7. Green tea ice cream - very creamy and had a light green tea flavor. We loved how it wasn't overly sweet.  8. The stamp card- I love the idea, it might be the only thing that could bring me back.   The bad:  1. Tuna poke - only 4 small bits of tuna cubes! it was really bad. I only tasted salty soy sauce and nothing else.  2. Baked green mussels (2 pcs) - it's just a lot of sweet mayo, nothing special  3. Takoyaki - it's all dough! There was a tiny dot of octopus in each one.  4. Sunshine/Or sunrise roll? It was horrible! The sauce they used tasted like chemicals and left a foul aftertaste. We couldn't eat it. My boyfriend felt sick after he ate that roll. 5. Strawberry mochi - they used some knock off mochi brand and it tasted like fake bubblegum. It wasn't good.  Value: 3 stars - It's a little less than average. It's a lot pricier compared to Naka Sushi. The fish was fresh, but definitely thin baby cuts or not consistent. Also their AYCE menu selection is noticeably smaller than that of other places. It seems like they focus on rolls here. Their side dishes (appetizer) selection is very slim and basic compared to Naka Sushi or Sakana's selection.   Service: 2 stars - The hostess was very cheerful and energetic. However, our waitress seemed like she was over her job and like she was dragging her feet. She seemed annoyed that we wanted to order more food. Many times she would disappear into the back and we would not see anyone on the floor for a while. On a good note, it didn't seem like we were on a timer at all for the 45 minute lunch and we didn't feel pressured.   Would we eat here again? I doubt it. Only if we're in the immediate area and wanted a later lunch that ends at 4pm. Other than that, we preferred Naka sushi's value and selection and my personal favorite Sakana takes the crown in selection, flavor, and quality!",

    "text": "AYCE is always a must with my group of friends when they come to Vegas. Everything they do here is out of control. Excessive gambling, drinking, and partying. To finish off the weekend, there is also a need for excessive eating since they didn't get much nutrition in their bodies all weekend.  Food: $26.95 for All-You-Can-Eat Sushi Dinner. This is probably one of the best AYCE sushi spots that I've tried. The nigiri portions come out small, which isn't much of a problem since it's AYCE! The menu is really extensive. There are plenty of options including the kitchen items. The only items they limit per person is the uni and the ama ebi (Sweet shrimp)  Dessert: It even includes AYCE dessert: Green tea ice cream, lychee sorbet (AMAZING), tempura vanilla ice cream. They also have green tea creme brulee, but they limit it to one order per person.  Service: Wow the staff here are quick! I came with a group of 9 and they brought out everything with alarming speed. I guess it's expected because they only gave us a 1 hour time limit on the AYCE.",

From the quality of the fish to the inadequate wait service to the novice work behind the bar, this place has totally slipped for me. The red snapper tasted a bit dry and dense as though it had been left out and everything else was just so-so...I did get to top off my underwhelming experience with their melted then refrozen freezer burn mochi.  Side note: In talking about this place with other sushi owners at places I frequent, it's widely known that their fish quality has taken a hit...they said there's a specific reason why but they declined to elaborate...sad as I've been here more than a dozen times.",

    "text": "All you can eat sushi for $26.95! Let me repeat that, in case you didn't catch that- ALL YOU CAN EAT SUSHI for $26.95!!!!   My brother who visits Vegas at least once a year highly suggested that I venture off the The Strip and give Sushi Goyemon a try. I was very skeptical being that it was all you can eat and at such a crazy low price. But being that my husband and I love both sushi, and a deal, we decided to check it out.  We may have not hit the jackpot in the casinos, but we hit the jackpot at Goyemon!  This was by far the best all you can eat sushi joint for it's food and it's price! There was a large selection of nigiri sushi, sushi rolls, side items, and desserts, and ALL of it was included in the AYCE price! Salmon, ikura, hamachi, toro, ebi, saba, uni, shrimp tempura, salmon kama, poke, gyoza, shumai, teriyaki chicken, green tea ice cream, creme brulee....and I could go on and on and on.  It's basically a full menu that's AYCE.  Though the nigiri was small, the fish was fresh and I didn't mind it being small, so that I could try lots of different things without getting too full.  Rolls were full size, but you can order half a roll so that you don't get too full on rolls.  This is to your advantage since you will be charged if there is any leftovers.    My favorites of the night were the lemon roll and and salmon belly.  The ikura tasted really strange though.  The only reason I'm giving this place a 4 instead of a 5 is because on the night we went, the rice was inconsistent.  The first order of sushi we had, the rice was seasoned well.  The second and third round of sushi had a very strong vinegar flavor, and if there is one thing that I don't like in my sushi, is an overpowering vinegar taste.  The last round of sushi that we got, the rice was back to normal.    Sit at the bar for a better experience.  It was so easy to order our sushi in small batches since the sushi chef was right there in front of us. If you sit at the bar, order the sushi from the sushi chefs, and the sides from your server.    The wait for a table at 6:00 was initially 1 hour 20 minutes, but they called us after 45 minutes.  They conveniently text you a link when you put your name in, and you can see where you are on the waiting list by clicking the link.  We put our names in and drove down the street to Trader Joe's and got called while we were there.  They graciously saved our seats and we were seated as soon as we got back.   I don't know when I will return to Vegas, but when I do, Goyemon will definitely be on my list of places to eat!",

We got seated at the sushi bar area, that is the best seats if u have a small party.  We ordered sushi from the sushi chef and appetizers from the server.  Our server was very attentive and patient to explain the menu to us, the chef was great too, he kept feeding us (lol) and made sure we got all our orders.    Quality of the sushi is superb! Fish is fresh, sushi had the right portion of fish and rice, and chefs did great jobs on the presentation as well.  Salmon kama was very juicy and not dry at all.  Grill calamari, shitaki mushroom, gyoza, tofu were delicious as well!   Sadly we can only order 1 sweet shrimp & 1 uni suchi per person, because they are really goooood... And if u want soft shell crab, it has to come with a roll, cant order just by itself.  No oyster on the menu either.    Green tea creme brulee was good but hubby preferred the coconut mochi.",

    "text": "Who knew that ayce sushi would be so delicious in vegas! I'm from LA and we have a lot of ayce places but the ayce sushi here is good! I was surprised because I can't think of where their fish comes from haha anyway, jokes aside...their fish tastes pretty good and I love their special daily fish menu. Most ayce places do not serve premium fish but their daily specials have fish like toro, salmon belly, red masago, etc.. they even have yuzu sherbet (like a mix of fruits) and lots of diff flavors of sherbet to choose from with unlimited orders! Who doesn't want more than just one green tea ice cream at the end of their meal :) that's a PLUS PLUS! The only thing I didn't like was the rice to fish ratio. The rice overpowers the fish and in the rolls, it feels like you're eating a mouthful of rice and tiny amounts of fish. I understand that sushi places just want to fill you up with rice but it's seriously overdoing it and much too obvious. The servers are nice but it's hard to get anyone who isn't your original server to help you out. They aren't the type that comes to your table and ask if you need anything else.",

Tonight was the worst service I received and I usually am forgiving as I do have friends and family that work in the restaurant business.   I have dined all over Vegas and around the world from hole in the wall restaurants to Michelin star rated restaurants.  This will be my very first review I feel compelled to post.    I came with a party of six and we all ordered the \"All you can eat.\"  My menu was sticky and dirty and wasn't cleaned or wiped thoroughly.  I ordered 3 half orders of sushi but only received 2.  My third sushi was taking awhile so I asked the server if it was arriving soon and she said yes.  Waited about 30 mins more and I asked again and then she said she would have put in the order again.   Long story short, I never got my third sushi and I was just over the wait!  They have also failed to explain the name of the sushi being served  and also combined some of our orders on the same plate which left our party guessing who's sushi is whose and what sushi is what.  My 2 sushi's were mediocre and bland.  My other friends sushi was drenched in sauce and one of the sushi had avocado that was turning brown. I spoke with the manager and all he could say was sorry, made up an excuse and lied saying they did serve me my order thus accusing me of lying and did not offer anything to make up for it.  They still charged me full price and I left the restaurant hungry.  NOT SO \"ALL YOU CAN EAT!\"    Mediocre food,  horrible service, disorganized, bad management, a complete rip off.  I really don't get how they attract a lot of patrons.  Definitely not worth my time and my hard earned money.",

Nothing sparkled during the previous visits until today, we asked about the stamp cards out of blue and the manager on duty accepted the old stamp card! I feel like they have changed management. Now, there are still flaws. For example, when we were placed to sit at the sushi bar, the chef never greeted us or asked if we wanted to place any order. We noticed that this was odd bc we were waiting for 5-10 min. But apparently he was at the end of his shift and didn't want to take anymore orders. Understandable. I always get the impression that these guys work really hard and never get a decent break. After his shift was over, a new guy took over and immediately took our orders. Yay! They also encouragingly ask customers if they have stamp card, which is a new, good practice. I feel like a lot of restaurants out there do the stamp card but don't like to promote it. Wish I edited my last post instead of deleting it, but great positive changes!",

Sushi: were inconsistent and sloppy, ratio between rice to fish was outrageous. They ran out of Uni on early Friday night.  Rolls: were pretty good due to sauces but sauces and amount of rice were overpowering the main ingredients.  They do count the hours down, try not to go over hour limit.  Overall, ehh....

    "text": "First time there and after reading so many reviews, both good & bad. I went to see for myself. I guess everyone has their opinion of every restaurant in town. Well it was not so busy and we got seated right away. Our server was an Caucasian guy which is not a problem, the problem was that he never smiled once. Yes he did his job but a smiling face goes a long way towards customer service in making you feel good dining at the establishment.  The asian waitstaff was much better in the fact that she smiled and actually help a conversation with me, wow can you believe that!!!!!   Now for the food, it was good and for sushi per say how can you really screw up on certain items like Ikura (salmon eggs), massago (fish eggs), pretty standard items that you buy from the wholesalers and you don't do anything but serve it.  For the Fresh fish, well it's another story, had the poke hahahaha it was good tasting but really, 4 pieces of fish at this size 1/4\" x 1/4\". Now I know it's all you can eat and trying to control waste but I think it's a little too skimpy on the fish for the poke.  Over all it was good, love the fact that they do the sushi correct with the correct amount of rice and not try to fill you up with oversize rice portion.  The only issue was the seating, which is always a challenge at a small restaurant. The tables are very close and the one next to us had a family with a whiny young child who would screech loudly for no obvious reason.  I would definitely return - hopefully there will be no screeching children on my next visit.",

One of our friends who lives there recommended  we go here, but to get there right when they open, which was 1145 am. It is located outside of downtown and the Strip, so the prices are very competitive.  One thing I have learned about dining in Las Vegas, places outside of the tourist areas have the best value for your money.  We were a party of 8 and were seated right away.  We ordered all sorts of sushi; white fish, uni, soft shell crab, California roll, spicy tuna, I lost track of all the types we ordered. The orders came out very quick and we ate them as fast as they came out.    I have recommended this place to several friends who are headed to the 9th island.  Believe it or not, a few of them have already heard of it from other people.",

Never comes out dry or stale looking. I drove from phoenix to eat here. I will continue to frequent here and I urge anyone who likes AYCE sushi to try it.   Updated review: I last reviewed this with only good things to say, but for some odd reason I received the worst service today.  First off, I live in Arizona for nursing school and I finally had a break from the work and decided to drive all the way out here for this place alone. I always had a great outlook on this place til today. After arriving, we got seated and our order taken ( I usually order everything at once because I know how much I can eat and what I want ) but the server already seemed dismissive but I figured she was probably tired and worn out so I thought nothing of it. After that first encounter, that was it... no refill on tea, no plate to eat on, no side dish plate for soy sauce.  As the night went on, I stayed patient hoping she would notice we had nothing... I had to ask someone else for plates and other stuff. This worker dodged us the entire time ( older Japanese lady ) and the sad part was that we made eye contact numerous times but she served everyone else but us. After 30-45 min has passed, another worker asked if we needed anything. I asked for a manager but he stepped out and I just decided to pay the bill and leave without causing a scene.  Tldr: service was balls that haven't been washed, Discrimination was present from the server, first time I have not left tip at all and I usually do even if service was bad. I will continue to come here as my experience was tainted by an incompetent worker but she is not a reflection of the entire establishment.",

    "text": "I find it quite ironic that there are many AYCE sushi restaurants located in the middle of a hot desert. That just makes me wonder where they even find all these fishes ...  Sushi House Goyemon offers $21.95 45-minute AYCE for lunch (11:45 AM to 4 PM) and $26.95 60-minute AYCE for dinner (4 PM to 3 AM - last order @ 2:30 AM). Sea urchin (aka uni), sweet shrimp, and pork belly are only available for dinner. I will say that 45-minute is enough time to try whatever rolls or appetizers you want to order on the menu.   Our group came here 15 minutes before opening time and there was already a small crowd  eagerly waiting to get in. Luckily there were enough tables & seats to accommodate every customers. We placed lots of various sushi & appetizer orders and the staff only got 80% of our orders correctly. It was a minor hiccup because we just ordered for our missing items again. Oh one good thing to mention - I really enjoyed my complimentary hot tea.   *** $21.95 45-Minute AYCE Lunch ***  Nigiri (white tuna, seared tuna): Pretty fresh fishes, but the ratio among rice, vinegar, and fish were not very balanced.  Eel hand roll : Generous portion with lots of eel. One of the items I would definitely recommend.  Scallops: Not bad, but too much vinegar.  Spicy tuna roll: It can get VERY spicy if you ask for fully loaded spicy level. Ignoring the spicy level, it was a very solid spicy tuna roll.  Steamed Shumai: Meh ... would not order this again.  Lychee Sorbet: Tasted a bit chewy and icy ... could be worse, but didn't blow my mind.  ***  A solid 3.5-star for me, but I will round up to 4-star due to somewhat decent fish quality. Overall this is a good quality AYCE sushi place with lots of missing orders. If you ask me whether it is worth the drive off the Strip ... I will have to say that this is not an absolute must-visit and you will have to ask yourself how much do you crave for sushi.",

However, I had to put in this ranking to hopefully get the attention of the management/owners.   Eating there tonight, it was the first time I almost spit out my amaebi nigiri. I had to fight through how slimy it was, the whole time thinking I really hope I don't get food poisoning!  :o  Then for dessert, I ordered a vanilla ice cream mochi and the first bite was really terrible. :( I was horrified. I've grown up eating regular mochi, and I know that the ice cream mochis you buy in the store generally aren't soft like the \"real\" mochi...but this outer mochi was almost like eating plastic.  I figured, ok, I'll just eat the inside ice cream. That was gritty - like eating sand (not even crystallized sugar or anything).  I debated over telling the server that it really shouldn't be served to anyone, and to suggest a manager try one of these so they might pull it from bring served tonight - but they were slammed and I didn't want to make a scene to ask for a manager / have to get someone's attention in the crowd.   Yes, I'll still come by here at least one more time and hopefully it'll be back to normal. But please please pull the vanilla ice cream mochi until you can get edible ones in (and check on the amaebi quality also).",

So considerate.  The best thing is that they don't overload on the rice if you do get sushi. I think other places load up on rice to make you full faster but this place went light on the rice and heavy on the good stuff.  I was stuffed leaving this place and a few hours later I wanted to go back, it was that good.",

The wait staff weren't taking our plates off the table, and the tables are small so it's really needed.   2. By the time they served us food we still didn't have a plate setting. How we're we supposed to eat?  3. They weren't reaching out to see if we wanted to order more. I felt like I was pulling teeth to get an order in. I had to raise my hand like a first grader.  4. This is probably my least favorite thing about my dinner. The food took soooooooooooooooo long to arrive. My first round was 2 orders of salmon, yellowtail, white tuna, and albacore, each. That's 8 pieces of sushi total. It should not take 30 minutes to make.  5. This is unrelated to service but their uni sucks. It was really fishy and almost bitter tasting. Thus, their quality has dropped too.",

They told me they ran out of uni. So we go ok fine we'll get two orders of sweet shrimp instead of uni + swt shrimp then? They go no they can't do that. I'm like What??  They constantly mess up the order like bring out things we didn't order or totally forgot about our orders. more importantly, they put SO MUCH RICE IN EVERY NIGIRI!!! The fish slice is so thin, like sheesh I might as well eat a bowl of rice. See my pictures for reference for the amount of rice per fish ratio.

It was only $3 to share with my toddler, which liked.  Some places try to charge you half price which is horse crap because my child eats like a bird.  A dead bird.  He doesn't eat much.     First off, lemme say, I love that they allow you to order half rolls on the AYCE menu.  This means we can order a large variety of rolls and if we don't like the roll there's not much of it to choke down LOL   They have a decent selection of appetizers and cooked items and the best desserts I've ever seen at a Sushi place.  We had chocolate mousse, yuzu sherbert, and creme brulee and all were delicious!   My favorite rolls were the lemon roll and the sexy girl roll.  Neither of them made me gag, which I consider a success because I hate sushi.  Both were delicious and I was left wanting more.    I would have given 5 stars but everything took FOR-EV-ERRRR to come out and they forgot one of the rolls we ordered.",

Attempting the 'carb-less' diet. . fish selection was very fresh and reasonably priced. $14 for 12 pierces & soup & salad as well! my only recommendation would be thinner sliced sashimi. the chunks were quiet a piece to place in your mouth & fully enjoy it.

I live right by Sushi Mon, and we ventured out to Goyemon expecting something better, but it was pretty much the same.  I did like how you could order off the new item menu and it was included in the AYCE price.  They are pretty strict with kids eating any of your food here if they are not paying, which is understandable, but kind of hard to explain to your 4 year old when they want a bit of your roll and you just can't justify spending $26 for them to eat it.  It would be nice if they had maybe a reduced rate for kids.",

However tables are small and they are very close to each other. I would not recommend for private dinner. There isn't a personal or private space in between tables even though it is a full-restaurant. The restroom was very clean and unique/pretty.   Sometimes I had to wait but not a long wait. Tried few other dishes other than AYCE and it was pretty good.   For the fast, not the top 10 but overall, very casual but pleasing place to go.   fishes are good but I personally didn't feel freshness to it. (very soft texture for raw fish)   No wasabi inside of sushi.  It could be a decent place to go with comfortable friends or family. Not really a place to empress anyone. It is Very Clean and Neat but no private space nor not a fancy looking place. ;)  Quite as well.",

I wish there wasn't a limit of one order per person bc I would have ordered another 5 orders for myself!  Besides sushi I also tried the mussels and pork belly. I was disappointed in the pork belly after everyone talked so highly about it. I thought the pork belly at Bachi Burger was way better. The mussels were great. Only had one order as I couldn't stop eating sushi.   Also if you like really spicy food I would recommend the 911 roll. It didn't start off spicy but it gradually built until my tongue was on fire. I felt like I was doing a Man vs. Food challenge!  Overall it was a great experience. I didn't leave much room for desert but had the lychee sorbet and it was great. They even had small pieces of lychee in it (nice touch)",

    "text": "I'm a frequent at Goyemon and nine times out of 10 they deliver.  The service more times than not is quick and efficient.  There is one waitress there that I'm not very fond of, but most of the other servers bust their ass on a daily basis.  Food is churned out a consistent rate, but don't be afraid to be on top of the servers...there have been a few times when our order was misplaced by the chefs.    The wait times during peaks hours are LONG.  Expect on Friday and Saturday night to be waiting up to 1.5 hours for a seat and they absolutely do not take reservations.  However, the wait is very much worth the experience.  I'd recommend heading over to PT's a block down and grabbing a beer while you wait for them to call and tell you that your table is ready.  They're pretty flexible and understanding that it may take you five minutes to get back to the restaurant to get to your seats.  In addition, I would highly recommend going here for dinner, than going during lunch.  The service and food has always been better in the evening than during the day.  The overwhelmingly majority of the time the fish is as fresh as it gets in Vegas (there was a good two visits in a months time during the past year and a half that my partner and I have been going their where the freshness was questionable.  However, it was temporary.  The next time we visited the quality was excellent.).  They will often have some very beautiful cuts of tuna that are just to die for.  I find it quite impressive for an AYCE restaurant to be serving this quality of meat.  The range of items you can an order on the AYCE menu is insane, but I love the variety.  I would recommend the following if you're going to be doing all you can eat for the first time:  Nigiri: - Yellowtail - Garlic tuna - Super White Tuna (melts in your mouth...so good!  My absolute favorite!) - Cajun tuna or cajun albacore (cajun tuna is a special and they run out quick, but I find cajun albacore to be a great substitute). - Red snapper  Grill: - Steamed edamame (I find the the garlic edamame to be far too greasy, stick with the steamed!) - Pork belly - Super white (it's a special) - Yellowtail  Rolls: - Magma - Sexy girl (the cucumbers pair so well with this roll) - Crispy rice  - Yebeisu - Salmon skin  Dessert:  - Red bean ice cream!   - I'm not a big green tea fan, but everyone tells me that their green tea creme brulee is excellent.  If you just want to try a bunch of different rolls, than you can order half a roll for the large majority of the items.  Trust me for the tempura and especially the baked items...you may want too!  For a quality sushi dinner (that just happens to be AYCE) at $26 for dinner...it's hard to be beat.  You just have to know when to go and hope you don't get the one waitress that will drive you nuts!",

    "text": "My friend recommended this place, she said that this is a must-try AYCE in Las Vegas. Umm, I do not agree at all. Turns out this restaurant is the sister to Sushi-Mon, I was kinda surprised whether my standards have changed over the years or the quality has gone down since my last visit to Sushi Mon.   To start, nigiri did not good.. Some fish was not fresh n rice is packed loose. I know I should've given more attention to rolls since they look artistically pretty that i dun wanna eat it. but these rolls have all the same ingredients to me. That's why I opt for nigiri and taste the freshness of the food. But there are some props abt this place. at least salmon and unlimited halibut made me very happy. I also like the half order option where u can order just 4pieces instead of 8.   It's surprisingly busy during lunch in a Tuesday. Only 2 waitress and 1 bus boy. It's quite hectic for an AYCE place to place order by telling the waitress instead of customer writing on an order sheet.   I probably would sample other AYCE restaurants off strip next time I go to vegas.",

We don't eat seafood-learning, but we almost did because everything we saw looked so good!!  We had the pork belly for an appetizer, lucious yum.  The California rolls that came with our teriyaki combos were so incredibly fresh!!!   The teriyaki chicken and  beef were delicious.  My youngest, 6 really enjoyed the orange chicken.  And we all enjoyed the gyoza.  Will pass on green tea creme brulee next time.",

While 30 minutes is a pretty long wait, we were hungry and there weren't many other options that would be open so late so we stuck it out. Three people in our group got AYCE and two of us got the regular option (I like to take my leftovers home and don't mind the extra expense in doing so). Between the five of us, there were a lot of appetizers, sushi, rolls, and dessert. I myself had the crunchy spicy tuna thing (I never know what it's really called, I just know that it's delicious), the shrimp tempura roll, and a scallop yum roll. They were all great and tasted especially fresh. I really wanted to try the wonton chips but they were sold out which I take as a good sign (next time). I'm not a fan of green tea anything (I'm Chinese... I know, it's sacrilege) but the green tea creme brulee I ordered was devoured in minutes (by me). Yum. We all left, full and happy and I have permanently saved this as my go-to late night (or possibly any time of day if I'm in that area) sushi place.",

We sat at the bar and were greeted by teo of the coolest sushi chefs ive come across... well ever! Hiro and Tony ( I hope i got the speeling right). I wish I could name some of the highlights of our meal but I couldnt even tell you because they just kept handing us different things to try. I do recommend the pork belly if you are not on any type of diet and could care less about your arteries, and the wonton chip dish was awesome. Wouldnt have minded it being a tad more spicy. Overall the fish tasted fresh and delicious. The highlight of my sushi meal is that you can order everything in 1/2. The smaller the dish the more I can try! Last but not least we tried the chocolate mousse for dessert which was of course amazing and I left this place fat and happy. Now if only it was closer to home I would be there all the time.",

    "text": "After eating here hundreds (literally) of times, I got myself a serious case of food poisoning.  I was with my daughter and both of us got deathly ill about 36 hours later. We were there on December 22, 2012.  I noticed several reviews that stated they also got food poisoning right around that time so I decided I needed to write this review.  I did go in there and tell them about it.  I was told not to come back if I was concerned about the food (needless to say, I have not been back since).  They did not apologize and they apparently knew there was a problem because several other people (based on these reviews) had already alerted them that they had also gotten very sick.  I ended up at Spring Valley Hospital with a $1500 bill (thank goodness I have insurance...my co-pay was $150).  I learned at the hospital that when you get sick 36 hours later it is viral and the virus is caused by dirt rather than bad food.  For this reason, I cannot go back there.  I am very disappointed in this restaurant.  Good luck to those of you who dine there... you're going to need it!!",

We went in on a Saturday night about 7pm, and it was crowded.  The hostess told us it would be about an hour, it only took about 30 minutes to get a table.  We had the poki tuna salad which was ok, the Rock N Roll which was ok, the Orion roll which was ok, and the Red Dragon roll which was pretty good.  We opted out of AYCE, due to the menu for that being mostly glorified California Rolls.  Our bill wasn't bad at all, hubby even had a beer and I had a hot tea, and we had a $50 bill at the end of dinner; considering we ususally drop a lot more at sushi, this was a bargain.  Not sure if I will go back here--kinda a trek off the strip and away form it all, would need to be much better sushi!",

There are tons of sushi to pick from, and there are also some special sushi every night, which I didn't know about the first time I went. But the second time, they had seawater eel and toro (fatty tuna), and both of them were awesome! The sweet shrimp (my personal fav) taste really good. The other sushi were fresh and taste delicious. After the sushi, we had dessert, the green tea creme brulee and tempura ice cream were delicious.  My only complain is the waiting time. So I recommend you order everything that you can think of the first time or you will be hungry for a long time if you order a little every time the server comes over. Also, go there early, I waited for 40 mins the first time and an hr the second time before for seating. Other than that, this place is great and you should seriously try it out.",

I love the fact that even though it's AYCE, they don't make the huge rice balls to try to fill you up.  That's the only experience I've had with AYCE.  The nigiri was nice.  Fish was super fresh.  Rolls were meh.  I liked the fact that when they say AYCE, they mean everything on the menu.  So you can order appetizers, cooked food like grilled fish, grilled other things, tempura,  udon.  Ramen is only available after 11pm.  But the desserts and sides are also AYCE.  I can see why the wait time is so long.  I do like the fact that you can put your name in and they will text you and allow you time to get back.  Haven't seen that anywhere else.  I would have spent well over $100 bucks if I'd gone anywhere else and ordered same stuff, or ordered ala carte.",

Food was alright as usual, but service got terribly terribly worst. I had the same server for the last two times I went, it was a mexican dude. I don't have any problems with mexican or any nationality but this dude was just ignored us. Every time my gf and I went we always tip good, but he just ignored us, I thought he was busy or something but no he was walking around talking to other customers and took their second round order. He was gone right after he took our first orders. It was just irritating seeing this guy working there. Will never go back until this guy leaves this place.",

So I came here while waiting for my car to be tinted down the road at Eco-tint. It was perfect bc it was a 3 hour wait and this was a 13 min walk, a little over half a mile. I got the all you can eat lunch. There is SO much to choose from, like 50 special rolls, like 50 regular rolls, appetizers, sides, deserts. It's crazy! It was perfect for trying everything bc they are small portions and u can get half rolls. Everything was REALLY good, the waitress and cooks were great. I sat right at the sushi bar so I could watch everything. I honestly have nothing bad to say. The only reason I didn't give 5 stars is bc of the appearance. It's very small, not well decorated, and there's no bar. At first glance, if I wasn't pretty much stuck without a car I would've left. But I'm glad I didn't. I'll be back and will bring my boyfriend. Thanks! Now I'm in a food coma, guilty, and wondering how I'm going to roll back to my car lol",

For side dishes, I loved the grilled pork belly, grilled yellowtail, and spicy tuna on rice crackers. Honestly there wasn't anything I didn't love!  The uni here is the freshest I've ever had in the US.  The menu is very extensive and the fish is all very fresh.  I had the green tea creme brulee, strawberry mochi ice cream, and lychee sorbet.  I think my favorite dessert was the lychee sorbet.  This is definitely going to be my go to place for sushi from now on!",

I was visiting friends in vegas and this is one of their favorite places and im so happy they took me to goyemon. The all you can eat is awesome. Though you must finish all the food you order but its soo good i dont know how anyone could leave food behind. THE PORK BELLY OH MY GODDDDDDDDDDDDDDDD drool!! It was the best thing ever, we must have gotten like 4 orders of it. The mingus roll is probably my favorite roll, deep fried spicy tuna, cream cheese and avacado. The seaweed salad was awesome, desserts were awesome. Im actually not a huge fish fan aside from tuna so i cant tell you much about other things. But everyone i was with loved their food. Ive been obsessing ever since i was taken here. The only bad thing is it gets really busy so you might have to wait a while, i do wish the building held more people. But that goes to show how great the food is.",

Unfortunately, I wasn't too impressed with the taste & quality of the sushi.  Ordered the  Alaskan roll, Dragon roll, seared salmon nigiri, volcano, amaebi, uni, and for dessert- green tea creme brulee.  The Alaskan roll was a disappointment. I was hoping it would be similar to another sushi place (one that has a red mask in it's name), but it was lacking all around.  The sauce on the dragon roll was a bit overwhelming for me.  I tried the uni for the very first time & the only positive thing I can say about it is \" thank goodness it was a small serving\".  I'm glad I tried it, however, I will never try it again.  The best part of my experience here was the green tea creme brulee.",

Which in my case did happen. I felt like I was ordering everything wrong. Everything I tasted that my roommate ordered was delicious. The pork belly, for example. I can't tell you how many servings of those we chowed down on. Overall I'd say the red meat selections were better than the white.

I tasted it and it was awful,  Ordered seaweed salad, that was ok, the tempura shrimp order, 2 shrimps, 89 percent batter and 11 percent shrimp, so you get the idea its all made to be cheap.

I trust the all you can eat menu is why portions were so small as well, not really fair for those not interest in pigging out.

Rice for sushi was cold with some parts of rice uncooked.  The raw fish (nigiri sushi) was bad, I think they gassed the fish with carbon monoxide to look red, but bad texture.  Raw fish on nigiri sushi pieces were cut small like they were trying to save money.  Although service at Goyemon has always been poor, it makes it worst when the food was terrible.  We brought 4 guests bragging about this restaurant and our credibility was shot.  I don't think I will be going to this restaurant again when I go for my semi-annual trips to the Orleans Hotel and Casino.",

I did a lot of research for a good sushi place before my room mate and I went to Vegas for a week over NYE and we weren't steered wrong by the reviews. The AYCE sushi was great quality, there is a ton of variety on the menu, and you can also place half orders so that you don't fill up too much on just one thing. We went three times in one week! Twice for lunch and once for dinner. Sushi is super expensive where we are from in Bermuda, so we were beyond excited to pay less than $30 for AYCE (we definitely don't have that option at home!). They don't do sashimi but they do pretty well everything else. It is quite a small restaurant and was packed every single time we went, there was also a line waiting. That's when you know it's worth the wait. The last time we went for lunch, we went right when it opened so we didn't have to wait to be seated, but it did not take long before the place was full. I spoke to some guys who were from Vegas who said they eat there all the time. I can't list my favorite roll because there were too many choices, just try everything! I will say the steamed gyoza are incredible, I could have eaten those all day long. They do have a time limit stated on the menu, I think it was 45 mins - 1 hour per person, but I'm pretty sure we were there a longer than that and no one kicked us out.   Go here, it was amazing. I am craving it right now and can't have it as I am 4 time zones away *tear*.",

Quality of the rolls were just OKAY, the rice on my rolls were a little...soggy? The deep fried rolls were very tasty, and fulfilling. I have to commend the spicy rolls they have here though! The spicy rolls, in particular one...was HOT! Besides the spicy rolls, the dessert was a pretty good factor in making me like this place, the creme brulee was great!  Service was okay, the servers can be dauntingly slow and inattentive. They took forever to bring the check to us, despite rushing us to finish our meal.

I'm not sure if we were to give the head guy a tip to get a good table, however, it was obvious larger groups, small groups, were being seated before us.  we again left to go to another sushi house and  was seated within 5 minutes.  the night that we had planned turned out okay, however, we didn't eat until 8pm.  we will never return, obviously they didn't want our business.",

    "text": "One of the happiest days of my life was when my relatively new gf, who used to not be a fan of sushi, asked me if we could have sushi for dinner. Of course I would take her to Goyemon. Now, it's our \"every other week\" spot for AYCE sushi.  The first time I ate here, it instantly became my all-time favorite sushi restaurant. After having tried another place, that place came pretty close, but to this day, Goyemon still holds the spot for #1 sushi place.  Super white tuna=like butter in my mouth. I can finish 10 orders of this and still not be full. Gotta try the dynamite, it's the best in town. More staples are shrimp tempura, calamari, baked green mussels. For nigiri, other than super white tuna, yellowtail, garlic tuna, salmon, sweet shrimp, unagi, and cajun albacore. The gf likes rolls, and always gets the Japanese Lasagna and the OID. I like the pastel myself. I don't like rolls that much anymore. They make me full a lot quicker and I want to make my AYCE experience worth it every time. I honestly haven't had a roll here that I didn't like. Dessert: You gotta save some room for some green tea creme brulee. Sometimes, they have vanilla creme brulee and chocolate mousse too and I just go all out and order that trio. Now this is the only sushi place in town I know of that has this high a caliber in desserts, and that my friends, is the second reason why it is my fave sushi joint. You already know the first (clue: it's like butter in my mouth).  Oh my, now I'm craving for Goyemon.",

    "text": "This is the most reviewed AYCE sushi in Las Vegas area. Therefore, this was also the first restaurant I considered to go back in January. However, I was a bit concerned about people's comment about the bad service here. Finally, I went to Sushi Yama in January and was very satisfied with Sushi Yama.   This week I am in town again. Really want to give this place a try because of the good review about food quality. Also I am planning to go on Friday lunch and did not expect this place would become too busy, and hopefully I won't encounter the service issue that other patrons mentioned.   Unfortunately, I end up have all these first hand experience with a cocky waitress. I called in advance and ask them if there is one hour limit for lunch time. The host told me that I can eat there for 1.5 hour. I think it is quite reasonable because we don't like to be rushed. When we were seated, I saw the Uni and sweet shrimp are not included in the lunch. I was not very happy about it because if you look at the menu online, it was a bit misleading. Then I saw the 45 minutes limit on the menu and I tried to clarify with the waitress. I told the waitress that we just called the host and she said we can eat here for 1.5 hours. The waitress insisted that 45 minutes is the limit stated on the menu and it has always been the rule. Well, I just spoke to the host 10 minutes ago and now I am getting the total different information. Then, this WONDERFUL waitress said the time limit is 45 minutes, it is up to you if you want to eat here or not. I don't trade off being respected and welcomed no matter how the food quality is. It really upset me. Later on, she added on if they are not busy, they don't really enforce the time limit strictly. So I figured out that was why the host said 1.5 hours when I called the restaurant.   It would just be a lot easier that if the waitress explained they don't enforce this strictly instead of telling me it's up to me to stay or go. I think she maybe too exhausted and she feels better if she doesn't need to serve that many customers.  So, finally we walked away and went to Umiya and enjoyed the great sushi and excellent service there. I will recommend all my clients and friends going to Yama or Umiya in the future",

Albacore nigri was over powered by lemon.  The Mingus had a very nice tempura finish. And the catapillar had a lot of avocado which I love.  I also love cream cheese so I tried the baked lasagna sushi. I found it somewhat disgusting.  Lots of oozing warm cream cheese.  Yuck.  The tempura ice cream was interesting and a nice cap to the meal. Crunch and cream.  I liked enough that I will try again, but overall I prefer sushi koma.",

    "text": "That's really funny that other people (yelp members) got Food poisoning from this place too! I am also in the medical field and I knew I got food poisoning. ( along with my wife). I called Goyemon to let them know what happened to us and all they said was sorry the first time. Then I called them a second time (after I figured that my friends also got food poisoning. Coincidence....I think not) To let them know that it was definitely from their food. They proceeded to argue with me and not let me speak to the manager. (actually I heard them talking in the background and the manager says its not their fault). They advised me that I was suppose to call within 48 hours and let them know. I did but I didn't remember the lady I talked to. I really think it was a bad way for them to handle this situation.They also told me that they fly everything fresh and everything on their menu is toxic free. They tried to blame the situation on my own doing. Just to let everyone know, I went on 12/16/2012.  And DUK C. went on 12/21/2012.  I thought the food was amazing and delicious but unfortunately they did not own up to their mistake. I am now scared to eat from Sushi joints all because of their place. I hope this post would serve as a warning to all before you attempt to eat at this establishment.",

Personally I like this place better than Sushi-Mon, because they have more special rolls available and there are way more desserts to choose from - all of which you can have in the AYCE.   Our server was very good, she made awesome suggestions. The pork belly isn't one to miss as well as the Blue Fin tuna sushi which was really fresh. Beware of the 911 roll! Talk about en el fuego! It has habanero chili sauce. Be prepared for a fire in your mouth that lasts about 10-15 minutes. Eating more sushi rice after helps quell the heat but damn, it's a hot one. It was cool to try it though.  I am looking forward to my return!",

Later, when we asked for the bill, they charged $13.95 on my 3 year old son. I asked what's the age consider kids $13.95?? The guy did not answer my question directly , instead, he questioned me back twice, how old is him? ?WHAT KIND OF ANSWER AND SERVICE IS THAT?? ! I told him he is 3, the guy starting to say... well, yes, with 3 years old we charge $13.95 blablaba... WHAT A LIE!!! They have it on each menu, 4-9 year old is $13.95! He ended up with another LIE: THE MENU ON THE TABLE ARE THE OLD ONES AND HAVE LOTS MISTAKES. So he still charged me $3 for sharing! If it's the old menu and with LOTS mistakes, why you still give it to the customer?! Plus, I DO NOT SEE ANYWHERE FOR THAT $3 SHARING!!!! IT'S TOTALLY A RIP-OFF!!!!  I paid the $3, don't want to deal with this CHEAP restaurant anymore! DO NOT GO!!! I will go back to Yamasushi!",

When my boyfriend and I are feeling like eating something light and the wait's not too long, we go here for ala carte and get either the sashimi or sushi platter. When the opportunity cost is better, we get AYCE which is decently priced at $27/person.   The crispy rice with spicy tuna app is one of my favorites from Goyemon. They also have daily specials for desserts for AYCE that are limited one order per person, last time we were there they had chocolate mousse and creme brulee available - both very delicious! The chocolate mousse was thicker consistency more like a ganache.",

We even called before hand to make sure they would stay open on a slow night in vegas and we're assured we would be taken care of. Upon entering Goyemon the hostess Ashley was instantly rude and obviously did not want us to come in. I've worked in restaurants for 15 years so I understand wanting to go home but after we called and such a consistent restaurant assured us we would be served the normal hours. I was shocked. Ashley said she first had to get chef approval and they were only offering ala cart after 12. I've been dining here 7 years and never heard this restriction. I also live In Henderson and live one minute from sushi Mon (same owners) and won't support their business any longer. I was so embarrassed and disappointed about these new rules and Mis information. So many places in town go somewhere else",

Unfortunately with this place being small they don't take reservations. The couple times that I've been here its taken 30 mins or more to wait for a table. Usually its worth it for Salmon Belly but if you're starving this might be the place to go.   After our 40 min wait we were seated at a table for 6 even though we had 7 people. Tight fit! We were immediately greeted and asked our orders. We all just placed one large order and waited for them to have it out. It took them 10-20 mins for them to have it ready, It all came in small waived but that worked out for our group and table size. As soon as we were done with one plate another would come. They also kept checking if we wanted to order more so that it would be ordered to keep consistent.  They were busy and couldn't really keep up with our refills but they did a decent job. We ordered a lot of sushi, but unfortunately they ran out of the main reason why we were even there... Salmon Belly... *sigh* We did however get to order a lot of desert so that was nice. Personally the price was good for all the food that we ordered, but I wasn't too impressed. The wait time itself wasn't the best, and the size of fish slices on our Nigiri wasn't the best either. I don't have a problem coming back here because the taste of the sushi was good, just wish they had bigger portions. I mean it is all you can eat so can't expect huge pieces.",

    "text": "For the price, 4 stars!  We dined in for dinner, with a party of 12 adults and an infant. There are no reservations, so we had to get there and hope for the best. At 5:30, the restaurant was 90% full. That being said, we only wait for 20 mins to get seated as a full party. Awesome. I didn't have any expectations of this place, except that I hoped for $30/ head it would be decent. They completely surpassed my expectations. Sushi is one of my favorite things to eat, but living the midwest I am limited in the places that have good quality fish, I am usually paying $25 for 2 great rolls at a legit place. So to pay $25 for all you can eat (affectionately dubbed ACYE), I was pretty much in Heaven.  We mainly stuck with Nigiri, and only did a few rolls and apps. I think we ate 15 orders of 2pc Nigiri each!!! The selection of fish is outstanding, and they will even let you order some of the more expensive cuts (toro etc) at least 1 times per person. I consider that pretty generous. Their \"signature\" sauce here was a garlic ponzu, and while it was mighty tasty on the first few orders, it got old really fast. You can ask for the fish and the rice plain for any of the nigiri, which we started doing after a couple of orders. The fish are a nice cut, and thick too. They aren't skimping on you here. They also have hand roll, maki, and baked rolls but we wanted to keep it simple that day.  Definitely recommended as an excursion off the strip if you love sushi and basic Japanese apps (tofu, kaarage etc).",

The one thing I like about this place are the daily specials. IMHO it's the Goyemon daily specials that set it apart form other AYCE sushi places. Goyemon has specials that are unique or unusual...a type of fish or delicacy you never heard off. Some of the specials are limited to one order, while the others are part of the AYCE experience.   No complaints at all about the food. The waiter did bring us wrong items...stuff we did not order, but no complaints really, we were game...totally willing to give it a shot. While the food was good, the service was a bit spotty. When it got busy, the staff started forgetting some of our orders, brought out doubles of stuff we already ate and also stuff we did not order.   I would say for the best experience, try to come here during off peak hours, when its not so busy.",

The restaurant is extremely busy so you'll have to be patient with your orders, but it is definitely with the wait !! Their nigiri and seafood is with really high quality, and I can see all the action in making. My favorites are uni (tastes like heaven), sweet shrimp, halibut, yellow tail and scallop. And please do try their grilled items as well! The yellow tail filet and cajon salmon is out of the world. But one order is pretty small so you may want to order more than that !",

Pork belly was good until second order, then mainly fat... Teriyaki chicken is large chunk dried breast meat with teriyaki sauce drizzled on top after cooking, or warmed in microwave...   Yakitori chicken skewer much better... Thigh meat actually grilled then teriyaki sauce drizzled on top... This dish took 20 minutes to arrive, maybe because it required real prep and cooking...

To start Goyemon is always busy, so if you have more than two people expect some kind of wait. They don't take reservations, but you can put your name and phone number down when you get there.  You'll get a text when your table is ready and can also check your place in line on their website. Once seated service is usually prompt, though one of the times it seemed like they were short staffed. I've only gotten AYCE and can say almost all the nigiri is delicious.  If you're hungry for some good sushi and don't mind waiting 10-20 minutes this is the place to check out. Also the pork belly as an appetizer is awesome, so try it out!",

But whenever I'm in Vegas, I try to make an exception and Goyemon is definitely a place where I go all out.  Skip the skinny jeans and put on that billowy dress with the stretchy belt because we're having half the ocean's worth of fish for dinner tonight, kiddies!  I'm Seafood's worst enemy and I take no prisoners at Goyemon!  Goyemon is my ultimate favorite place to go for sushi and it's crazy for me to even say that!  I've taken my brother and friends here and they all go crazy for this place.  Nothing in Arizona can compare.  With uni, sweet shrimp, salmon belly, blue fin tuna, unagi, conch, aji mackerel, garlic tuna, and black tobiko being on their menu, how can I not love this place?  There's so many more amazing bites and everything is fresh [Remember:  fresh salmon should smell like cantaloupe!]!  Even with the all-you-can-eat, they don't try to rip you off by offering more rice and less goodies like a lot of other places do.  It just proves how great their work ethics are.  Don't forgot to check out their ever-changing daily specials.  Goyemon is a trendy little place and it's nicely decorated.  The wait time can be pretty crazy and they're always busy.  The wait staff is pretty on point here as long as you're nice and polite.  Loud annoying people generally are given much worse service as we've seen first hand with the annoying drunken jerks next to us.  But in the city where clubrats and lushes prevail, I can see how they're just over it.  Stay on The Strip, fiends! Let me just have Goyemon all to myself.  Give me an hour, dim the lights, and don't come in when my stretchy belt is hanging on the doorknob.  NSFW.",

    "text": "I've had this place bookmarked forever!  As soon as we got off the plane today, I drove here to finally check out all the hype.    My main interest was in the saba and the uni.  A sign greeted me at the door that said that they were out of uni.  Poo.  Anyways, my impression of the menu was that Goyemon relied heavily on the deep fryer, cream cheese, and yum yum sauce (along with the amusingly named \"orgasm sauce\").  I'm a nigiri/sashimi type of girl myself, but I can still appreciate this stuff.  Still, this was a bit much.  On the plus side, they were really nice about making subs.  Like I wanted the Alaskan, but with real crab.  Done!  And the servers were so fast with the order, which was important when you only have 45 min to indulge (though I doubt they time it).    Good sushi has to have good rice.  Here, the grains don't melt together.  It's like the individual grain is a little too al dente.  The rice improved later in the evening, but still wasn't great.  Also the knife work wasn't on point.  I'm not talking about against the grain of the flesh or whatever...like the sushi was cut all crooked at times.  And someone at the bar was overzealous with the lemon.  My hotate and escolar nigiris had quite a pucker factor.    As far as my favorites...def the saba.  I always order saba b/c aside from not having to worry about food dye, mercury, or pcb, it's mad good.  It's got a very strong flavor though, so if you do eat tuna, salmon, etc, you might want to save the saba til the end of the meal.  The grilled squid was great, too.  It comes in thick cuts like fat fries.  They also offer it in tempura form.  O, and if you're feeling like there's too much rice (they really don't overuse rice here), save the rice from your sushi and order the dynamite.  Yummy!      Overall, this is def a fun restaurant to visit and for $20 of unlimited sushi, you can't go wrong.",

I think the quality of this place is hit or miss.  I saw some pictures of toro that looked decent, but the pieces that we got were just nasty.  I put it in my mouth and instantly choked because it was so fishy.   The saving grace was the maguro.  It was fresh and a decent cut, and I liked the garlic tuna which was basically a ponzu sauce. The rolls were pretty involved and had a lot of stuff in it, if you're into the complicated and overly sauced thing.   However, for what you get and the selection, its a good price and pretty good for sushi on the mainland that is AYCE. If I didn't live in Hawaii and have access to Kona Kai on a regular basis, I'd probably love this place.",

I will come back here every time I come to Las Vegas because it is literally the best AYCE sushi place in the city, and just off the strip. You usually have to wait a while for a table, but if you're eating at the bar, you can go right in if there's seats open.   I recommend not ordering too much off the menu right when you sit down. You have to finish everything or they will charge you ala carte prices, so you should order from the sushi chef as you go. You can order half-rolls so that you can try more types of specialty rolls without filling up so fast, and you can even order 1 rather than 2 nigiri at a time.   Don't get the spicy tuna roll because it's just a plain roll with nothing else in it. The pork belly was just o-kay...it wasn't super special and it's just too greasy. The tempura ice cream is not that great either--the tempura batter isn't crispy, just bready. Next time I'll just get 1 or 2 mochi ice cream, because the green tea ice cream that I had wasn't a strong green tea flavor, more on the bland side.   The $5 sake I got was such a generous amount, I kind of regretted ordering it since it made me feel full too fast. I should have gotten the smaller size.   But all-in-all, despite my ordering blunders, I really REALLY enjoyed this place. Go for the unagi, amaebi, hotate, and ikura. Super duper fresh, generous, and artfully done.   Mostly locals come here, so the party next to us asked how we heard about it. They were regulars. It's a small place, so go early if you have a larger party, or sit at the bar if you're on a hot date. It's worth every minute and every penny!!!",

They don't short you on fish, they don't give you huge pieces of rice with your sushi to save money, they don't slow the service down to prevent you from ordering more, and the food's delicious. Around $27 per person for dinner and $22 per person for lunch.   PRO TIP FOR FATTIES LIKE US: if you order a crap ton of sushi like my family does then sit at the table and not the sushi bar. Sitting at the sushi bar means you order direct from the sushi chef which can be awkward if you place multiple big orders. We sit at the table and place our order from the server which is less awkward.   The only downside is the wait is crazy long on weekends. They also ran out of uni one evening (included in the dinner price) and wouldn't compensate for this in some way whether through an extra order of sweet shrimp or anything.  If you download their waitlist app you can check how many parties are before you. They call or text parties when their table is ready so most parties wait in their car. Don't be fooled by the empty front desk: there are usually dozens of parties before you.",

For $26.95 at dinner, you can't beat the quality and service. If you're on a budget, I think lunch is a bit cheaper.  There are so many good rolls (and some forgettable ones) that it's hard to dislike this place! My only warning is to make sure you don't over order. You can order half-portions for a lot of them, which is what I always do when I dine here.   For appetizers, I especially love the tempura shrimp and fried calamari. I order more than 2-3 each because they're just so darn good. They arrive super hot temperature-wise, so be careful. I feel like they deep fry them right after you place the order.  Overall, this place is a safe bet for any meal. I'll definitely recommend this restaurant to anyone looking to get a bang for their buck. There can be a wait sometimes, which sucks. Oh well.   Make sure to save some room for dessert too!",

We ate here straight after a 4 hour drive from LA. I wish it had been a little more satisfying. Service was ok but kept having to ask if our orders were coming and for refills. This is off the strip so you do need to be able to drive to location. May or may not come again next time we're in town. If you go hopefully they have their lychee sorbet. That was my favorite part of the meal along with their shrimp tempura.",

She couldn't even apologize. Will be back again, crossing my fingers for a different hostess next time.",

Long story short, we got our bill and was charged for dinner. I know it's a $5 difference, but be True to your advertisement and words. That definitely knocked off a good tip. I believe in tipping good because I have family who earn money that way. I could care less about this place, tbh.",

I arrived after the lunch hour began and the place was near capacity for lunch.  I opted for the lunch sashimi special which was reasonably priced and included miso soup, rice and salad. The quality of sashimi was unfortunately A-ok with the exception of the salmon which was the tastiest and ended my meal with a generous portion of green tea ice cream.   Another con was the spotty service - I had to flag down the waitress for assistance and also request dessert! Not sure if they were having a off day here but I probably wouldn't return here again.",

They make the best recommendations: ecstasy, sexy girl, and hurricane rolls = SO good. And they're so funny! I wanted to try the crispy roll and that wasn't good, pass on that roll (it's just a Cali roll deep fried). But they also emphasized how they're known for their nigiri, mainly the blue fin. And OH MY WORD, it's life changing. We got several orders of that. And lychee ice cream and green tea creme brulee is to die for.   My server (older Japanese lady) was thee worst, very slow and short. And then when my bf asked if they do anything for birthdays, she said no. When bf responded saying \"well I saw people post on Yelp about a free t-shirt\" she said \"not anymore, we only give one free candle.\" Then, the sushi chefs had another server bring out one free mochi and a t-shirt (thanks guys).   I tipped $20 but JUST for GIAN and ANDREI, too bad they have to share it with others. So in a nutshell:  SERVICE DOES SUCK but sit at the bar  FOOD is worth the wait DESSERTS are beyond amazing",

    "text": "Me and the wifey met up with Bethany E and her hubby Mike for lunch on a Sunday just right after they opened which was 12 pm. Already the place was packed and we were told that the wait was an hour. So we were given the option to sit at the bar. I thought it was better way for we got superb service in getting our rolls because the chefs were literally right in front of us.  We opted for the AYCE ($21.95) lunch option which was from 11:45 am to 6 pm. According to the menu, you had 45 minutes to alotted time to do the AYCE which didnt make sense because we were there for at least an hour.  What is good to mention is that most of the rolls you can get you have the option of getting a half (4 pieces) or full (8 pieces) roll. I strongly recommend that you get the half rolls so that you have more chances of trying more rolls. Some rolls are only available as a full (refer to menu for they clearly state which ones are not available for half orders).   As for what I ordered. Man, I will only tell the names but not describe them because this review would go on forever! That's what's good about doing the ayce option because you can try just about everything!  What I got for starters were the Garlic Edamame, Fried Calamari, Ahi Poke, and Shrimp Tempura. Then, we got half orders of the Taylor Roll, Sexy Girl, and Frying Jason, Then full rolls only for the Spider Roll and Pixie Roll. We also tried one order (2 pieces) of the Seared Ahi. Lastly, we finished it up with 2 pieces of Strawberry Mochi.  Originally, we wanted a table so we can all hang out much more comfortably while we ate, but after sitting at the bar, I think we got our orders much faster for the chefs actually hand you your order instead of your server grabbing it and bringing it out to your table. If you are at the bar, the servers are mainly there to get your drinks, appetizers, and dessert.   Overall, I think that this will be the measuring stick to other sushi places that I will be trying out. The only negative thing that might deserve a mention is the wait time. But after eating here, I can understand why it can be a long wait for they serve good stuff  and the overall size of the place is not that big. Shout outs to Bethany E and her hubby Mike for inviting us to lunch! You guys are awesome!  Yelp 2014 365 Review Challenge #135 \"Go Go Goyemon!\"",

No. I came in with my dad a few nights ago we're regulars we know what we order and I get the same ala carte items every time and my dad gets all you can eat sushi. I had the dumplings and my dad goes to eat one of them and our server practically runs to tell us that he can't my food because he's all you can eat?? And her managers are watching so he can't eat the food that is on the side??? So is he not allowed to drink his water either because that's not part of all you can eat. Except it's the other way around and I can't eat his food. I've never had a server as ridiculous as this girl Sara. She was completely rude and honestly just stupid. Throughout the meal she didn't check on us and everyone but her brought out our items. If you don't want to serve us tell someone else to instead of being a bitch, simple. The girl with the blue hair was wonderful and really helpful. She's the only reason we would come back. Didn't catch her name but she deserves a raise!!!",

    "text": "Honestly excellent. I have never had AYCE sushi before - was hesitant because in my head it just is pre-made, sketchy, gas station sushi waiting to be ordered (or buffet style that's been there?). God, am I glad I was wrong!  Craving sushi on a Thursday at 9pm. Decided to give goyemon a try. Had no problem parking and we were sat for a party of two immediately. Now, I had to browse the menu hard.   Pro-tip, get familiar with the menu before you go. Not that we were \"pressured\".. but the last minute on the spot ordering had a splotch of chaos.   Waters and Sapporo was quickly served with ginger and wasabi for our selections. No complaints on time.   Started off with the classics. Salmon, Tuna, Yellowtail. And a 1/2 philly roll. My only complaint was the amount of masago/roe on the roll. My mistake for not requesting it without, but I felt bad scraping it off.   Pro-tip: Always do the half - don't overcommit and waste food.  Amazingly fast and really fresh tasting.   Roomie got Uni (said it was good, I'm not about that life) and Miso soup. Shrimp Ebi.   And the 9-1-1 roll. When they say it's spicy, I mean my Asian roommate was breaking a sweat.   Mackerel, Halibut, Snapper nigiri. All awesome.   Then the specials board. Damn I hate I didn't see this first. Roasted shishito for the roomie. Miso salmon for me.   And. SALMON BELLY AND TORO nigiri. Kill me now. The $27 for AYCE is what I would have paid for my orders worth of that and one roll. And the toro. Amazing. Cuts. Of. Toro.   Also did veggie tempura and shrimp tempura. Tried the green tea ice cream (yummy).. lychee sorbet (so-so, I can't get on the lychee craze).. and the tempura ice cream (dessert show stealer).    For two adults, AYCE, and a total of three beers, we dropped less than $100 on dinner. Which was an amazing dinner. Used to go to naked fish a lot, but would leave hungry and broke. Goyemon will be the sushi spot now.",

But the server was attentive, quick, and helped us get more orders in by telling us that it will be a longer wait with sushi.

So I was very surprised when we got to order whatever we wanted off the menu, and the specials board and paid a single price for it!  You got one order of uni for the AYCE, but it was made fabulously.  You basically make back your money if you eat three rolls or so.   Easy.  On top of that, it was so good, that I went back with a colleague a couple nights after the first time I tried it.  With 2 people, seating is pretty quick usually except when it's hitting on the weekends.  This place is actually pretty packed.  Harry is awesome (one of the sushi chefs) and made us everything we wanted although I got schooled a little for trying to order uni again - oops. haha.  I would really recommend the nigri sushi, even though the rolls are great because it's super fresh.  If you're pounding sushi, I recommend staying away from fried stuff as much as you can.   This has nothing to do with Goyemon's work (spider roll is YUM) as much as it fills you up, so you can't try as many crazy things.",

Make your own rolls too by requesting what you want.  The sushi is cold, Fresh, and comes with very little rice.  You have a 1 Hour time limit but it doesn't ever affect your meal.   Favorite Sushi place so far in Vegas.    **Make sure to ask for a PUNCH CARD. after 10 you get a free All-You-Can-Eat",

My usual order goes like this for AYCE: A bunch of nigiri and then some rolls.   The rolls were actually really good. We had the hurricane roll, sexy girl roll, and some other ones.   They also have specials on their board which includes flavored sake  grilled: salmon, tofu, calamari, super white tuna  dessert: chocolate mousse, green tea brulee, panna cotta   and for nigiri specials: iwashi, kanpachi ,black tobiko, salmon belly, and cajun tuna.   I recommend the red bean ice cream for dessert and the chocolate mousse :)",

    "text": "Haven't been here in quite some time, but Sunday's UYE in the Tatami room was a great reintroduction.   Started out with a cold sake flight & the unfiltered was my favorite. Not sure of the names but they were the bottom 3 choices on menu. Service was attentive and water/tea was refilled regularly.   With a group of 16 the amount of food consumed during our 2.5 hour feast was almost unfathomable. Only a few True Man vs Food future contestants in training failed to hit THE WALL of \"not another bite\"  First I will list all of the dishes I recall ( keeping in mind that several were ordered 2 & 3 times!) Edamame, gyoza, miso soup, seaweed salad, Octopus Poke, grilled corn, Uni, pork belly, salmon belly, conch, hamachi with jalapeno, a roe nigri, spicy roll with crunchy bits, hurricane roll, rainbow roll, caterpillar roll, crispy shrimp heads, hamachi, spider hand rolls, mochi, lychee sorbet, green tea ice cream, green tea creme brulee, green tea cake, chocolate mousse. And I'm sure I'm forgetting some.   My favorites were: Octopus Poke, hamachi w jalapeno, salmon belly, hurricane roll & strawberry mochi. To say I left stuffed would be an understatement & I tried less than 1/3 of the offerings and am sure I missed some.   The fish was delicious and melt in your mouth tender. The only nit picky item I have is that toward the end, rice was warm, but I was full by then.   I will definitely be back, not sure if I'll do it next month as this kind of eating should be left to a rare treat, but if you're going to go for it, Goyemon will not disappoint.",

    "text": "I have heard a lot of good things about Goyemon, and I finally had the chance to try it out for myself today. My friend and I were waiting for our appointment at a nearby salon, so popping in for a quick bite to eat seemed the best option.  To start, there wasn't a wait to sit at the bar, and we were there during the lunch hour, so that was a plus. My friend opted for a beer, while I got the 2 roll lunch special (shrimp tempura rolls). The server was friendly, and quick, we did not have to wait long for our orders.  My meal came with miso soup, a salad, and the shrimp tempura rolls that I ordered.  For the price (less than $10), this had a great deal, as I ate enough to fill me up and still had some left over.  The food itself, was good, but not astounding as I was under the impression that it would be. Granted, I ordered a shrimp tempura roll, but I felt that the taste itself was on the bland side. Generally, whenever I've had shrimp tempura rolls at other establishments, there was more of a robust shrimp flavor. Perhaps it was a difference in seasoning used, but it just didn't hold True to the flavor that I normally expect of this roll. The miso soup was good, hot and tasted as I expected it to. My friend ate the salad, so I don't have feedback on that, but it looked appropriately seasoned.  3 stars for today's experience, the staff was friendly, but perhaps my expectations were too high, as the food itself was not as tasty as I hoped it would be.",

    "text": "AYCE appetizers, AYCE daily specials and AYCE dessert.  That, to me, is what makes Goyemon stand out above the competition.  We're not just talking miso soup or mochi ice cream either!  Delicious pork belly, yummy grilled veggies, daily sushi specials, green tea cake, black sesame creme brulee...these are some unique offerings.  Sushi here is good, and the daily specials always offer a good variety of fish to try.  All of my visits start out with me ordering one of every special, both sushi and grilled items.  The one thing that I haven't really been fond of is the rice.  I know that they get very busy, but it seems like their sushi rice is almost fresh from the rice cooker; by time the sushi gets to the table, the rice is warm and the fish feels like it's been sitting at room temperature for a while.  It's never been bad enough to ruin a meal, but it is something I notice each visit.  To be fair, other people I've dined with either don't notice it or it isn't a big deal, so it could be a personal thing.  Outside of my little rice quirk, Goyemon is a solid choice for sushi.  It has a big roll selection for your casual sushi friends, as well as a good fish selection for you nigiri folk.  Add in the appetizers and desserts to help cleanse your palate, and you have a dinner spot fit for most, if not all of your friends!",

Of course the main star of the show being the sushi is good wide selection from baked rolls and fresh and simple rolls. I'll always recommend the simple yet great Philly roll of course over here to quench my sushi sustenance.

I have wasted so much money eating at Roku in Caesars and paying double the price for ok sushi.  Tip, it's worth sitting at the bar and talking to the sushi chefs.  They offered us some pretty incredible stuff that they didn't have on the menu like Salmon belly.  Also, save a little room for dessert.  Loved their green tea cream brulee.

    "text": "Sushi? All you can eat? In Vegas? Sounds soo fishy o.O  I dislike buffets greatly because the quality of the food is usually very low and you force yourself to eat as much as you paid, if not more. Nor do I like the gross/overstuffed/ill/about to explode feeling after. Before coming here I have to confess to you, I didn't like the texture of raw fish or even the thought of eating something raw. O_O  Last January, I attended CES 2012 in Vegas. My friend and I hadn't eaten all day and we decided to head off The Strip for a late, late 3pm lunch. My friend is a crazy sashimi/uni/durian lover and wanted sushi. I remember my co-worker had mentioned about how much she had loved this place. I was a bit skeptical at first. Sushi in Vegas? Really? Sounds fishy to me!  AYCE lunch buffet for under $25? What a steal! The whole time we were there my friend and I only ordered nigiri! haha We really wanted to make sure we got our money's worth! It was to the point our server said, \"You know, we offer other items like specialty rolls and side dishes!\" :P After each bite of nigiri, my appreciation for raw fish greatly increased. :) All the nigiri we had ordered was very fresh and delicious! It was my first time trying other fishes besides salmon... fishes I hadn't even heard of. Tai? Hamachi? Hotate? Saba? Hirame? Unfortunately, we couldn't order the amaebi (sweet shrimp) or uni (sea urchin) because it wasn't dinner time yet :( Boooo... next time though!  Can you believe we still had room for dessert? Yes, I got 2 scoops of green tea ice cream and a scoop of lychee sorbet. All were excellent! I was a bit embarrassed to order the tempura ice cream since we'd ordered so much nigiri already and our server put our check down at the table, which was probably a sign for us to leave! haha I guess the next time I come back I'll need to order a few tempura ice creams first! :D",

The fish wasn't smelly at all and you could just tell that it was super fresh. It reminded me of the old Sushi Mon's fish (which use to be my number 1 go to place for sushi). Tuna and Yellowtail was just as fresh and buttery. Their new items such as the pork belly is a must try too. We also half-ordered 10 different rolls and all of them were just as tasty. For dessert, I got the lychee sherbert, green tea creme brulee, tofu cheesecake (tastes like cheesecake), and the fried ice cream. All of them thumbs up!

I am sad to hear the two Sushimon's are not related ( only because of my stamp card at Sushimon on Sahara and I wish I could use it at here or Sushimon Maryland). Sahara Sushimon has really gone downhill so we tried Goyemon. We sat at the sushi bar. The sushi chef was very friendly and attentive. I noticed when sitting at the bar at any other AYCE sushi (specifically Hikari- you need to scream your order and get his attention). Here-he asked us what we wanted very often and I did not even have to try to get his attention. It was really amazing service. The green tea creme brulee stands out to me and the spicy tuna on crispy rice. I love how you get a small amount of rice with nigiri. Everything tasted fresh and came out very fast.   My biggest disappointments: sashimi salad-I am a big sashimi salad fan and their sashimi is truly disgusting. I think it has ponzu on it (gag). I could barely eat it. That being said the best sashimi salad I have ever had in Vegas is at I Love Sushi. Now that has homemade dressing on top.   Cold grilled tofu salad-that dressing is gross. I could not finish the salad.   It's sad because I love tofu and sashimi and it sucks the dressing on both ruined the salad.   Otherwise, loved it and will probably be back for the other items!",

    "text": "Came here based off of a few local friend's recommendation and definitely glad I tried Sushi House Goyemon. I tried calling to make reservations, but they don't take reservations. I asked how long on average the wait is and they couldn't really say and when I asked just give me an approximation, they told me they have a wait every night. All I wanted was an answer of \"the wait could be X min to Y hours\"...but the hostess on the phone gave me a long run around...alittle annoyed.  Upon arriving, it's located in a strip mall about 1.5 miles away from the strip. They have a time limit of 1 hour, which is plenty to get full in one sitting, and have selected pieces, the sweet shrimp and uni, to 1 order (2 pcs per person). After ordering, our food took quite some time to come out, about 25 min or so...seemed to take forever. we didn't go overboard with order the 1st round because they said if you have left overs or leave the rice, the restaurant will charge you a la carte price. So 2nd round we went overboard ha....ordered what we really liked from 1st round. Top contenders are:  Super White Tuna (Pure awesome...must try as I've never had it and it was fresh and just umami delicious!!!)  Albacore  Halibut  Had a great time, didn't feel like we were rushed, good choices for sake and beer, but didn't get to try the tempura ice cream as they were out...I believe the AYCE is around $25-26 for dinner. I'd like to come back again but just make sure you come on a very hungry stomach so you'd be able to take advantage of the AYCE sushi.",

We were willing to pay for dinner ayce so slee can get the hamachi Kama as part of it but they won't let you even though they have it. Sushi mon who's supposed to be the same owners will let you. When asked why all they could say was different policy. The service was horrible. Waited for another hour for just some food.  They barely come by your table and when need something they don't want to look your way.  It's not worth the wait. The good isn't that good. Plus they pack so much rice per bite that you can even taste the sushi.  If I could tell all the people waiting right now to go somewhere else I would.  The worst place ever!

    "text": "We are blessed to have the option of AYCE sushi deals at pretty much all sushi joints in Vegas. So in my search of the BEST one, I think I'm going to have to go with Sushi House Goyemon.   Lunch is 21.95 and dinner is 24.95. I asked what the difference is and it's just a small change-up of the menu with the addition of some extra sushi pieces. Lunch would satisfy me just fine any day.  However, if you want to try that green tea creme brule and that nice green cake in the main photo... you'll have to join them for dinner (Reminder: come back for dinner soon).   The place is small and they don't take reservations. I'd say there were about a good 10-12 tables in the main dining area, and an extra 3-4 tables in their extra room in the back. So if you're planning to throw a big birthday hoopla there, make sure you and your guests come early to reserve because they won't sit you unless you are all present. The decor is simplistic but modern with their wooded ceiling framework and their fancy light structures (i think it came from Ikea).  Now finally on to the food. The appetizers aren't bad. The nigiri sushi pieces are mediocre. Too little rice, and not enough fish. If you're a salmon lover, skip the nigiri and just get a salmon handroll. It's much more worth it, I promise. If you have some rice left over on the place, order the dynamite (creamy mixture of seafood and mayo concoction) and pair it with the rice, it's actually pretty darn good and compliments each other very well! I'm not the biggest roll fan but I actually enjoy their rolls here. I love how they provide the option of getting half orders (4 pieces) of each roll so you don't have to kill yourself to finish massive amount of pieces to avoid any extra charges of anything left over.   There's some good and bad traits, but overall I think you'll get the most bang out of your AYCE buck here.",

They also accept the SushiMon frequent diner card.    Highlights were the specials such as the Kobe beef (cooked medium rare/rare) which melted in your mouth and other specialty green tea desserts.  There is still ayce on the mochi ice cream (unlike other stingy ayce places around town that only limit you to ONE mochi ice cream).  Try the grilled pork belly. It's a little on the salty side, but remember to eat it with the pineapple salsa.  Uni/sea urchin was super fresh, so was the sweet shrimp, and other cuts of fish that came out.  The shrimp tempura and fried shrimp heads were delicious, and the ahi poke was perfectly seasoned.    This place is pretty dang good.",

My favorite thing about the AYCE menu here is the endless dessert items you can order!!! I believe they're the last ones that will let you go all out on dessert items.   The service is mediocre as they seem to have their good and bad days. They're able to handle small and large groups without that many problems. The service has been usually great, some days it seems slow though.   The quality is pretty good. I have no complaints. They're definitely on par with Sushi Twister which is my favorite as far as nigiri sushi goes. I don't really go for the rolls so I can't really comment on those, but based on what my friends say when they order it from time to time, they're good as well. They do not put wasabi in the nigiri that I know of. Well at least the stuff I've ordered they haven't put any of it in, which I'm happy about. No surprises waiting for me when I take a bite!   Their appetizer menu is good, I don't really like the gyoza as it tastes like one of the ones I try to avoid at the grocery stores. I usually get edamame, miso soup, and a LOT of vegetable and shrimp tempura if I order from the appetizer menu, but I haven't been ordering those as of late.   Ama ebi nigiri is only offered for dinner pricing! I was a little sad at lunch when they told me that, but I wasn't going to eat enough to warrant paying more for, so I usually skip that during lunch.",

We arrived close to 10PM and the wait was 30 minutes. Luckily, we weren't starving so we enjoyed the outside waiting area on a relatively nice night.  Once we sat down and looked at the AYCE menu, our minds were blown. There are well over 100 items available with every nagiri and specialty roll you can imagine. My favorites were the uni (so fresh, sweet, creamy, and beautiful), super white tuna (I felt like the heat of my mouth made the fish melt), sexy girl, crispy rice, and green tea creme brulee.   The sushi places I'm used to eating at typically pour a lot of eel/yum yum sauce on everything so I thought that the tiger roll and 911 roll were a bit dry. The 911 roll is no joke. I can stand a lot of spice and my husband could only manage one piece, so I had to polish that dish off by myself. My eyes were slightly watering by my last piece.   This is my new go-to AYCE sushi joint with it's expansive menu, fresh fish, nice decor, and good service.",

Heck this place beats the socks off of some sushi places in San Francisco, but I digress...  Overall, the sashimi was of pretty good quality all things considered.  They even have uni and amaebi (1 order per person) and it didn't suck!  Some of the rolls and nigiri were somewhat sloppily prepared, but then again, it's Las Vegas, not Japan, right?  What was also great was that they also had grilled pork belly and other dishes on the menu that were AYCE - not just sushi.   Service was great; our waitress was attentive and very friendly (and even encouraging us to order more).  Reservations are definitely needed for larger parties, but I'd make a reservation anyways to make sure you take full advantage of this diamond in the Las Vegas rough!!",

    "text": "I went to Goyemon the very first time based on the reviews of my ever so reliable fellow YELPers.  Honestly, I wasn't impressed the first time I tried their AYCE.  I intentionally did not write a review thinking that I should try them some other time. Or, maybe I went there on one of my  \"bad taste buds\" days.  By trying them the second time, I was giving them and myself the proverbial \"benefit of the doubt\".  I was actually intrigued and surprised to see some of the high praises and Hallelujah reviews about Goyemon.  Having lived in Japan (I was stationed in Iwakuni, Japan and travelled around the country) for two years, I've had the once in a lifetime experience to actually taste what the cuisine, both regional and national, is really like.  It may not make me an expert on sushi-ya, but I can claim some kind of leverage over the regular sushi and self proclaimed Japanese food lovers outside the Land of the Rising Sun.    I returned to Goyemon at the behest of a friend.  We were initially going to Sushi Mon, then changed his mind to Oyshi, then finally decided on Goyemon last minute.  I was OK with it.  I thought my second trip would give me more reason to form and write down my opinion(s).  So here it is.  - just like the first time I came, there was a long line, or scattered groups of people, waiting to be seated.  The parking was somewhat limited.  It was lunch time on a Tuesday.  Always a good sign, you might think.    - After an hour, we were finally sat down right by the front door where people were standing up and gathered, waiting to be seated as well.  We had to take the table otherwise we would've waited longer.    - We both opted for the AYCE lunch.  There were only two ladies working the tables and 2 guys behind the sushi counter, an older Asian guy and a younger Latino guy . It took a good 15 minutes before the lady came and asked for our drinks, and get our orders.  - Drinks came, followed by our orders.  They came incomplete, and few wrong ones.  It didnt matter to us.  We're both hungry so we didn't care since we knew we could re-order the next time she got closer to our table. Wrong. She didn't get near our table until after half an hour because she was busy taking and delivering orders somewhere else.  I was worried our 2 hour limit would expire way before we could get our third and fourth round of orders.    - the nigiris came and was surprised and disappointed with the shari.  Making sushi rice is an art in itself.  I remember watching the itamaes in Japan manually fanning and painstakingly and delicately mixing the steamed rice with seasoned vinegar.  What I had in Goyemon on both occasions were their version of \"broken rice\".  The rice weren't sticky and they would break down as soon as it hit  the wasabied soy sauce.  The rice literally disintegrated.  I was so close to asking for a spoon since the chopsticks were useless .  (FYI:  In Japan, chopsticks are never used when eating sushi.  They use fingers.)    - Their wasabi was obviously made into paste from powdered green colored horseradish. It had neither bite nor kick.  Normally, they would clear up your sinuses and bring you to tears for a second or two.  Their's was just light green, grainy and dry   Their gari (pickled ginger) didn't spend enough time bathing in its pickling brine.  It was bland!  The fish  that were served to us were haphazardly cut and unevenly sliced.  Where's the \"aijou\"?  - The tempuras, rolls (handwrapped and deep fried), baked and fried appetizers were decent.  The miso soup that I ordered at the very beginning came in towards the end of our meal and was meh, as in really, MEH! It was all broth. I didn't see any diced tofu or wakame seaweed in my soup.  Their poke salad was not really poke (go to Island Sushi, folks!).   - I finished my meal with an order of green tea ice cream.  Ordinary.   It is safe to say that I've tried and tasted all the items on their AYCE menu in my two visits.  My friend looked at me, and said:  \"Sorry\".  He knew I did not enjoy the meal.  And he read me like an open book!  For the price we paid, I personally think we were robbed but then again its the standard going price for AYCE in the valley.  There's just something fishy (no pun intended) about going to a sushi place not owned, run and staffed by non Japanese, and recognizing that most of the non-white customers on both days I was there were Koreans.  I am not hating. Just saying.  I also observed (while its taking them forever to deliver our orders) that most of the customers were ordering and pigging out mostly on fried entrees and rolls, and not on nigiris.  That's when I hypothesized that the 5 star reviews I've seen and perused on YELP must have been based on the fried entrees, rolls and desserts.  Makes perfectly sense now ;)   Fool me once, blame on me :) Fool me twice, not coming back!    (I was told that Sushi Mon and Goyemon are owned and ran by the same non Japanese owners. Is there truth to that?)",

    "text": "WOW.  This place really makes AYCE sushi unique.  Not only are there the usual crazy rolls deep fried/sauce to the extreme/yadda yadda, BUT   There is...... PORK BELLY!!  All you can eat PORK BELLY!!!!  This pork belly was grilled with a sweet teriyaki like glaze and a side of mango salsa.  Perfection.  Fatty smokey perfection.  Other notable unique items: 1.  Spicy tuna on crispy sushi rice - Chewy, slightly spicy and slightly sweet.  I liked it more for the fun chewy texture but the man did not fancy it as much.  Strange, he's usually a fan of anything tuna.   2.  Tofu cheesecake - fluffier and not as heavy as its American counterpart, but when it comes to an amazing asian style cheesecake, Raku still wins hands down for their fluffy cheesecake.  We did not try any of the specialty rolls at all, but everyone around us seemed to be enjoying them.  We tried pretty much all the nigiri menu items (tuna, albacore, seared albacore, cajun albacore, white albacore, super white tuna, red snapper, mackeral, sweet shrimp, uni, salmon, ....). Most everything seemed pretty good, but there were some that were definitely more fresh than others and some we could have skipped (shrimp).  That didn't stop the two of us from gorging ourselves with enough fish to feed a small family.  Conclusion:  The owners of Sushimon should be proud of their new shining star of AYCE.",

I would recommend this place if your in the mood for sushi and in Vegas. This place has side dishes that are included in the AYCE, some of the dishes we had was the three grilled fish, pork belly, fried spicy fish cake.    Its definitely something different from the strip, and more of a local place which was what we were looking for.  Tired of the buffets, and wanted to get our sushi craving.  One thing that you should keep in mind is there is a wait and your looking for at least an hr minimum, but surely worth the try.  Would recommend if its your first time like us to get a seat at the bar and get to know them, they will recommend you what you should try and what to avoid.  The place is small, but the food is good and worth it.  Would say definitely drive off the strip and find places that \"industry\" folks frequent when they get off work.  Another thing is they are open til 3am.  Thats sweet!!!!  Late nite sushi.....Count us in...",

    "text": "In Cali, All you can eat sushi is often times plauged by fears of food poisning.  But in Vegas, where competition is tough, food is first class, only greatness can be expected.  Here are some highlights, keeping it short a simple: 1. AYCE dinner price is $27.00. Its totally worth is considering the price and QUALITY of sushi they have 2. They have many items, on the AYCE sushi menu, including specality rolls and lots of appetizers. Go for the Grilled Pork Belly. and mussels. You will not regret. 3. They understand people's needs-- not a big eater/not hungry? you can order a la carte on the menu even if everyone else at your table it eating AYCE and you won't get charged,.unless if they see you sneaking food. 4. waiting area is very small/non-existent. 5. The establishment is quite small, but it refelcts the amount of man power they have to efficetivy pump out and serve up the sushi-- if you do'nt want to wait, then you should make reservations. 6. punch card, for those of you who go to vegas a lot/ are locals. 7. Nicely marbeled fish, and very tasty.  beware of the older fish which they put lemon juice on it.",

I really enjoy the variety of sushi they give you for all-you-can-eat especially for the Nigiri which is my favorite and the only thing I ever order there. Their rolls are delicious too and sometimes overwhelming when it comes to the amount they give you, but overall still delicious.",

    "text": "This seems like a hidden gem in Chinatown. I came here yesterday night with a party of 14. The place is small so we had to be divided into two separate tables. So the concept of this place is $26.95 a person for an all you can eat sushi buffet. You don't actually get up and walk around and pick up your food. You're seated and you order through your waiter. Whatever you order you must finish. If there is anything left on your plate they will charge you for it. Luckily, for the nigiri they don't add Alot of rice so you won't get full too fast. we quickly ordered and wrote everything down on the paper menu so we could keep track of everything we ordered.   For the uni (sea urchin) you only get one order per person, along with the amaebi (sweet shrimp). Ask for the shrimp head as well!! It's Delish!! You won't regret it!!  The porkbelly was just okay. It was a little too sweet and fatty for my liking. But it tasted a little over cooked.  The baked mussels are super good! One order comes with two small mussels.  Super white tuna, yum yum scallop w/ a quail egg, salmon, salmon collar, hamachi w/ jalepenos, and Cajun tuna nigiri are all Yummy! The fish was so fresh and perfect portion. Each order comes with two pieces. I suggest you start with a little and order as you go. The food comes out farely quickly so no need to rush everything at once.  The sushi rolls are huge!! When I say huge, I mean humongous!!   Desserts are so good! The strawberry mochi was good! The green tea ice cream mixed with the lychee sorbet is to die for!! You won't regret ordering that! The fried Ice cream was really good too! I wasn't a big fan of the green tea creme brulee though.   Overall this restaurant was awesome! I would definitely come back on my next visit to Vegas! The staff was very nice and helpful. He wasn't strict about what we ordered and also called us a taxi when we were done with dinner.",

They kept messing up our orders, didnt refill our drinks, and service was so slow. We stopped going for awhile and then decided to give them one more chance. Big mistake! This time we sat at the sushi bar and the sushi chefs were horrible. nobody acknowledged us for 10 minutes and then when we asked who our chef was, the one that kept looking at us but looked away quickly said he was. we then ordered and he gave us one plate every 15 minutes. after our 2nd plate we got full drinking our beer so we left without waiting for rest of our order. I wonder if it's new owners or if the owner knows how their place is going down. so sad.",

This restaurant smelled like garbage which probably explained why nobody was there.  It seemed like the chefs were more interested in talking to each other than actually doing their job.  At least the staff waiting tables were a bit more attentive and friendly.  There are way better Sushi restaurants in Las Vegas.  Don't bother with this place.",

I ordered the half orders of the Domingo (Salsa with Jalepenos on top, yay!) , Jala Jala, Hurricane, Orgasm, Ecstasy, Rock N Roll, rolls as well as the shumai, mussels, lychee sorbet and strawberry ice-cream mochi.  Being a sushi addict in Vancouver, where sushi is readily available, cheap or pricey and good, my eyes were still popping with food lust as I perused all the creative flavour combinations on their menu.  The provocative names didn't hurt either, lol!  The Rock n' Roll roll with spicy shrimp and tempura crumbs was a real standout for me!  The Ecstasy was also an unusual roll as it had seaweed salad on top with smelt eggs in the tangy ponzu-ish \"orgasm\" sauce.  The other rolls were more subtle in their flavours and were nicely assembled, but I prefer the bold and spicy!  The mussels had a too sweet/tangy mayo sauce and the shumai had too much filler and not enough fish.  For dessert, the lychee sorbet was AWESOME, real chunks of lychee swirled into the sorbet.  The strawberry ice cream mochi was also super-yummy.  If ever in Vegas, skip the \"Strip\" eateries and head out to this place as well as Thai Style Noodle House . . . you won't be disappointed!",

We also had a few rolls I can't remember most of the rolls , I just remember it was all very good .     The service was the reason I took off a star , we did not get couple of our orders even after reminding her , and she saying it was coming right up. Yeah right!

Im actually upset my bf insisted on paying because I would've stiffed the waiter (and the whole crew if it's split) and I'm a server, it was that bad! When we did get our second order it was over 20 minutes after the first. It took 15 minutes for our 3rd order...of salmon nigiri. Freaking salmon on rice...15 MINUTES! I'm pretty sure our server forgot to put it in.   Food- once we finally got it It was terrible! Hands down worst sushi in Vegas.I would've rather ate at Sushi kaya with a C rating. At least we would have gotten better tasting food there, even with a health risk.   Price- 27$ per person for all you can eat. I wouldn't have paid $15 for it.

    "text": "Sorry Phillip T but this place has gone downhill since your post of April 2011.  Came here for AYCE dinner based on the 1k plus four star reviews from yelpers however we were dismayed overall by the lack of taste in the various regular and special rolls that we ordered.  About the only thing that was decent was the miso soup and the uni which had a sweet taste to it.  I even ordered a Hamachi hand roll but it only had Hamachi (a good amount) but there was nothing else. So where were  the veggies? Pickled Daikon - nope, slices of avocado - nope, slices of cucumber - nope.  Both of us commented on the very chewy seaweed used for the rolls and in fact at one point, I thought I was chewing a piece of saran wrap and spit it out.  Service was four stars by the servers who took our order for the miso soup and other non-sushi items but one star for the non-Asian sushi gen who was not engaging and in our opinion made some sub-standard rolls as well as lackluster nigiri which for some nigiri items should have had some sprinkled garnish on top of the fish.  I should have done more research as I learned through googling afterwards that this location and Sushi Mon in Henderson are related. That makes sense as I have eaten at the Sushi Mon Henderson location and that place was not as good overall as the Sushi Mon located on Sahara which is not related to these two.",

    "text": "Came here a few weeks ago for a weekday dinner with my husband. This place was pretty packed but only waited about 15 minutes. The restaurant has small tables all kind of right next to each other, so really gives you that cozy or cramped feel.  Anyways, this is what we ordered:  Sashimi Dinner- My husband ordered this and I was deeply disappointed with it even though I didn't eat it. The cuts of sashimi just looked so thin and small. I have dinned at other Japanese restaurants (I LOVE sushi and sashimi) and have ordered a sashimi dinner meal that is about equivalent with larger cuts of sashimi. This just made me think of how cheap and stingy this restaurant was being. It is a good thing that this dinner meal came with a salad (a nice portion, made with the dark green leafys) and a bowl of miso soup because anyone would be hungry after only consuming the small cuts of sashimi (this dinner meal also comes with a bowl of rice). Oh and by the way, in case you are wondering, the sashimi pieces itself tasted fine and fresh.  Goyemon Style Lasagna Specialty Roll- I thought this specialty roll would be really overly rich and cheesy from the description on the menu but decided to order it anyway because the name just kind of made me curious of what this would taste like. I am glad I ended up ordering it because it was really tasty and not too cheesy. But it was rather rich, but delicious.   Sashimi Salad- This is a new addition to their menu that you will find on your paper placemat. The price of this dish ($7.95 prior to tax) is actually pretty reasonable for the portion. The salad itself was made with the dark green leafys, which I really liked (instead of the cheap iceberg lettuce). The cuts of fish tasted fresh. The salad dressing (requested this on the side) had a nice light taste. Overall, a good salad that was fresh and light.  Service was fairly attentive but wasn't overly impressed with our overall dining experience. Wouldn't make a special trip to come back here again.",

The place is pretty small & there is pretty much always a wait when it comes to dinner time... I don't know if I have ever been here & there hasn't been a wait. For LARGE parties they do have a secret dining area as well which is a bit secluded which is nice especially when you try to talk amongst everyone in your group or your group is just darn routy ahahhaha  Service is pretty quick & they show you a good time... I say props for when I came to eat w/ friends & they we're able to take care of all 20 of us smoothly & kept the food coming to feed 16 bois & 4 girls who were starving & came to chow down! *bravo*  Besides the A.Y.C.E. they have pretty good specials as well which is nice when you are not tryna eat a whale during the day time.  SUSHI DINNER $11.95 - you can choose from Cali roll or spicy tuna roll & then it comes w/ 7 pieces of sushi (2 tuna. white fish. yellowtail. salmon. eel. shrimp) The combinations also come w/ house salad & miso soup.  SASHIMI DINNER $13.95 - also choose Cali roll or spicy tuna roll & then it comes w/ 12 pieces of sashimi (3 tuna. 2 yellow tail. 3 salmon. 2 albacore. 2 red snapper) This also comes w/ house sale & miso soup.  NABE YAKI UDON $11.95 - I got this dish & it came w/ an order of Cali roll & house salad which was freaken awesome because I was totally only expecting to get the udon itself! Way to surprise the fat kid =] but it did say it on the menu.. I just didn't read it hahahah  OCTOPUS POKI SALAD $5.95 - pretty good & simple served w/ seaweed salad & onions w/ a sesame oil dressing.

    "text": "Not the best sushi I've had, but decent All-You-Can-Eat sushi.   $21.95 for lunch for an adult, $3 for a kid under 3 yrs old. Could we get an under 12 option? Say, $15.95? From $3 to $21.95 seems like a big jump.   Everything we ordered here was A-ok, hence the three stars. The mentaiko (Pollock eggs nigiri) on the sushi specials was the best thing we had. Scallops were good. All the nigiri was good, but not amazing.   They don't serve uni or amaebi for lunch. Only for dinner, which is 26.95. I would think that would be worth the $5. Unfortunately, those were the two dishes I was looking forward to the most. I was pretty disappointed.   On the bright side, I enjoyed their chicken yakitori, dragon roll, squid nigiri, and tamago. Stay away from the 9-1-1 roll. What do you have to prove? So spicy you can't taste the food afterwards.   I think this experience made me learn some things about myself: (1) I don't like AYCE or buffets, (2) I'd rather eat less but have tastier food, and (3) I still want some good uni and amaebi.",

    "text": "Even though there are some negative reviews but my husband wanted Japanese food and we still decided to give it a try on Friday night.  We arrived at about 6:40pm and no need to wait. I think it's because we came in January which is not peak season that we were lucky to have all we wanted and the food quality was wonderful.  sweet shrimp and uni are limited for one order per person. Very fresh! Uni is so good and just melt in my mouth!   For nigiri, we ordered white tuna, salmon, yellowtail, blue fin, gigantic octopus. All are good!  I found that they will serve grill things faster. So I ordered many things on special menu, which are all good. Grilled Kama is must try. It's the most tender part of a fish.   The only disappointing part is rolls. The hurricane roll is not the same as I had before in other places and please get away from it.",

The only good thing was the wait which was shorter than 2mins on a Friday night dinner time, yesterday.   They did not have mirugai (some other ayce within that area does). Uni and amaebi is limited to one per person.   I thought it would be Japanese chef who are making sushi (like what I saw at jjanga), however I did not see any Japanese chef today, so I wonder if this is even an authentic Japanese sushi restaurant!",

This evening I found a hair on my roll and the server offered me 20% off! Ridiculous, right? She offered up her manager because I wasn't having it. So once the manager came over, I told her that I didn't think I should have to pay at all for the roll with a hair, she promptly agreed to take it off the check; but upon further probing she advised that that is a standard set by upper management, to first offer 20% off when there's a problem. That's absurd!!   I also ordered mango mocha and received 1 strawberry and 1 mango. Someone who was not my server brought it out and I told her that I ordered mango and didn't know why I received a strawberry one, she was so nonchalant it's like she couldn't have cared less. That's kind of how it is there, in my experience. The service is ice cold and when they mess up something, they don't care. I'm definitely going to find a different sushi place because it's not worth sacrificing decent service for good sushi. I just can't go back there. The service is just terrible.",

We did not have all you can eat but the sushi and sashimi combination was terrible.  Fish is not fresh and tasteless, although price is cheap but quality is not there.  The rice that they made sushi was hard and tasteless and this is the very basic in Japanese food. Service is good but this place is so busy that you always have to wait.   If you just want to fill your stomach with food and a variety of food, it's a good place.",

Being that we were visiting from Hawaii, we were first timers. We walked in and was greeted immediately. We put our name on the list because there was a wait. The wait was wasn't that bad...about 20 minutes considering it was peak dinner time.   We were seated and helped immediately by the waitress. We were like kids in a candy store. Just make sure whatever you order, you eat..it not you get charged.   Being an uni and ikura lover...I ordered these til I couldn't take anymore. My husby on the other hand ordered everything else in the menu!   You won't be disappointed! Service was outstanding and sushi was delicious! We enjoyed this place so much we went 3 times before our vacation was over! Lol",

Unfortunately, our other option had an hour long wait and after some quick thinking, we decided to gamble and see if Goyemon might have a shorter wait...  Not only did they have a shorter wait (about 20 minutes on a Friday night), we also had a great time! The manager Arpi (Arpee?) and our waitress DJ HOOKED IT UP all night. Fantastic recommendations (super white tuna has changed my LIFE) and very attentive service. We usually frequent a self-serve sushi place up the street (which we're now embarrassed to admit), but we've seen the light in terms of making Goyemon our new go to spot. Incredibly fresh fish despite being an AYCE and a ton of awesome options that are rarely seen at other AYCE (uni, toro, salmon belly). Everything we were looking for and more for a double birthday experience.  Can't wait to come back next time and try more things on the menu!",

The bite size pieces of sushi are just perfect, not too much fish (I hate it when the piece is too big and it warms up in my mouth), and not too much rice (I hate AYCE places trying to fill up guests with rice!). Also the hot items come in \"tapas size\" so you don't get too full on them and you can try multiple items. The mix of cold and hot items balances each other out and satisfy mind, body, and soul. This place is the AYCE SUSHI HEAVEN.  Here is a list of my favorite nigiri and hot items:  NIGIRI - yellowtail, albacore, salmon, super white tuna, sweet shrimp, uni, sweet egg, salmon roe, fresh scallop  HOT ITEMS - takoyaki, gyoza (steamed), miso soup with shrimp head, pork belly, shrimp tempura",

This place offers high quality sushi! I'm not kidding. The salmon belly is a MUST! Along with the yellowtail and salmon. The nigiri just melts in your mouth. Our group surprised the waitress as we scarfed down each of our orders within 10 seconds and asked for more.   The menu suggests that we only have 1 hr to order food, but it seemed like they didn't keep track of the time. However, we came right before the rush hour, so things may be different. But overall, the sushi is absolutely amazing! As for the grilled menu - I recommend the super white tuna, chicken yakitori, and the grilled pork belly. All are full of amazing flavor!   And to top it off, the dessert is also just as spectacular. BEST GREEN TEA ICE CREAM EVER. None of that flour-y taste. It's your genuine green tea ice cream! Also, they have different specials for dessert. That night we had the Yuzu sorbet, which tastes just like Kumquat (citrus-like flavor). I also highly recommend the Lychee sorbet!! Other honorable mentions include the vanilla and strawberry mochi ice cream.  Probably the best AYCE sushi I've ever had. Period.",

I can't believe I have been coming here for so long and am just now writing an update to my first review. Everything here is amazing and I tend to like to stick to the nigiri and some of the cooked options here. I can never resist the salmon skin handroll, pork belly and scallop. The dessert selections are all amazing as well. My favorites are the green tea and black sesame creme brulees and my fella can't resist the tempura ice cream.   We try to go during off hours so we don't have to wait too long for a table. We have never had any service issues and everyone is always friendly and helpful when we are here. If only they would expand a little into the shop next door so maybe the wait times wouldn't be as long.",

I was skeptical about the AYCE on sushi but my friend was right, the food was very high quality and fresh. Sushi House Goyemon has a full bar and good selection of sakes. We had so many orders of everything (see pics ) but the stand outs were the Ama Ebi, special grilled white tuna, and the grilled pork belly. Everything on the menu comes in small portions only 1 or 2 small pieces but the wait staff service was spot on even though there was no an empty seat for 5 min the entire night. There is a time limit for the AYCE and it's mostly to turn over the tables.   Tip  Order several items a once The portions are small but tasty so you try more Reorder the item you really like. Expect a wait but the hostess is nice and will even call your cell when your table is ready  Highly recommended, Great food, nice decor, exceptional service and did I mention the price $26.95",

Walking in, it seemed like an okay place. A little small, but my favorite sushi place is literally a hole in the wall, so you can't judge by the cover. We sat at the bar and the waitress (I think. Three different people served us sides and sodas, so I don't know) reminded us of the left-over policy and took our drink order.   There was a TON of chefs behind the bar. The amount of chefs should have meant the food came quickly and you didn't have to wait a while to order, but it was took an average amount of time. Which is okay, I mean, but I was struck by just how many chefs they had for a Wednesday night. It was like 8 or something.   We started off with garlic edamame, which I usually love. Here it was like half-cooked with melted garlic butter on top. By the end of it, I felt like I was drinking butter. Not the best start.   My favorite dish is Japanese Lasagna and I was excited that they had it, so that was my first roll. It had some kind of weird scallop sauce or something and was served on foil. I literally had to pry the sushi off of the foil. I next had some kind of fried California roll that was so breaded my friend and I could barely stand to finish it. He had a Red Dragon roll that he said was really good, but his other roll was meh.   We didn't bother to stay for dessert. It took years to get the check. When he gave them his card, a waitress immediately returned saying it didn't work. She seemed kind of offended when we both insisted he had money on it (he had literally just shown me on his bank account app) and came back ten minutes later with the receipts.   Pretty decent pricing, but you can get better sushi someplace else for the same price. We didn't even know who our sever WAS. Not the worst sushi experience I've ever had, but I'll stick to Naked Fish's up on Durango when I'm craving sushi.",

    "text": "Seriously one of the best AYCE dining experiences I have ever had!!!!  This is being said by someone who avoids AYCE (unless it's KBBQ) like the plague!!!!  The menu is very creative and tempting and there are things included with the price that you would never expect at a sushi AYCE like desserts and ramen!!!!  The price is just above $25 which seems like a lot but pretty much everything is covered by that money - including your drinks!!!!  Sit at the bar!!!! The sushi chef and his accomplices are pretty cool and not shy at all as they will suggest you eat what is good. This is actually a good idea since there is actually a time limit. Funny, a couple of times they gave us random items with our permission and we thoroughly enjoyed them. Needless to say I am an extremely picky eater and I hate avocado. We just told them to hold the avocado and they didn't make a mistake once! I liked everything I ate pretty much!!!! I enjoyed the J.J., Tiger, Rock n' Roll and Sexy Girl rolls the most. The Dynamite which is one of my BF's favorites is really good here! The desserts are to die for here!!!!  Service is pretty good. Few mistakes if any and the servers didn't ever have to be reminded about what we ordered! Give them credit, people order a lot of food here!  The interior of the restaurant is pretty nice looking!   This place attracts nice people apparently. I chatted with some guys at the bar and some other guy while I was waiting to use the bathroom. This says a lot about the food and ambience!!!! Of course they started the conversation in both cases. I'm usually quiet but the people here are soooo cool I broke out of my shell a bit!  This is definitely not a place for sushi snobs and I LIKE IT like that!!!! All the fish tasted fresh and was always very well complemented by the other things the chef put into the rolls.   There is only one drawback here, all that being said. You will most likely have to wait at least half an hour most of the time. That's how popular this place is!!!!  There is ample parking as this restaurant is in a newer good sized strip mall.  Trust me! This is the AYCE experience of a lifetime!!!! I am not into buffets (ugh!) or AYCE (if it's not KBBQ) but this place makes me forget how much I hate most AYCE/buffet establishments!!!!",

    "text": "Ah. Maze. Ing.  The fact that you can order half rolls instead of full rolls as a part of the AYCE earns them four stars right off the bat.  It makes it so worth the money because you're able to try so many of the rolls...which is awesome because their rolls are so creative!  There are 28 special rolls, none of which are \"filler rolls\" like shrimp tempura and cream cheese - they're legit rolls with great combinations of fish.  (They do also have shrimp tempura rolls, baked rolls, etc.  There's also nigiri, appetizers, and dessert, for the record.)  On a Thursday evening, we waited about 15-20 minutes for a spot at the sushi bar - the service was super fast and the sushi chefs were nice.  They even have a stamp card - after 10 visits, your eleventh is free!   This place was a home run.  Be sure and try the: Ecstasy Roll (with Orgasm sauce - delish!), Domingo Roll (jalapeno salsa!), Sunrise Roll, 911 Roll (hella spicy) and Jala Jala Roll.",

    "text": "Best AYCE sushi I've ever had. And it's out here, in the desert. LOL  My boyfriend and I tend to stay away from specialty rolls because they typically taste the same and they just take up room in our belly real estate.  The things that impressed me here was: - The freshness of the sushi, even out here in the desert. - The fact that it's an AYCE place but the sushi chefs still make the perfectly proportioned nigiri. They don't try to stuff you with rice so that you get full faster. They keep the integrity of the sushi and keep the proportions the same throughout the meal. - Some people say service slowed down as the meal went on, but we didn't feel that at all. The service was great throughout the meal. - The actual food-- as described in the following. - They have stamp cards! Even though we're not local, we asked for one because we come out to Vegas a lot.  We had tons of nigiri. The salmon was good, but the salmon belly was fatty and delicious. We loved the yellowtail. The tuna was good, but wasn't our favorite. The albacore was good, nothing special. White tuna was good too. The scallops and the kanpachi weren't bad, but we're not huge fans of those to begin with. You HAVE to look at the blackboard. They list the specials for the day. I was sad because they didn't have the blue fin tuna or the toro (fatty tuna). But they had the salmon belly and the kanpachi. We also had the sweet shrimp and uni, which are part of the regular menu, but the portions are limited. 1 serving per person (which consists of two pieces per person).  The braised pork belly was ON POINT. It was fatty, flavorful, and delicious.  Also, the dessert was awesome. I had the green tea creme brulee which was amazing. I love creme brulees to start with! We also had a vanilla mochi ice cream. It's probably store-bought, but I loved the flavor of the vanilla bean. I was extremely satisfied. Next time I'll try the lychee sorbet.  This isn't to say that there weren't bad parts about the experience: - The miso soup was bland. - The baked mussels were slightly bland. They weren't BAD, but I probably wouldn't order them again. - The chicken yakitori... it's just chicken doused in teriyaki sauce. Not impressed. - THE WAIT: We got there and there seemed to be just one group in front of us, but it took 45 minutes for us to sit down. It's such a small venue, you have to expect a wait.  Even with the \"cons,\" I still love the food here. I'll be back here for sure, it's on my \"MUST GO\" list along with the Oyster Bar.",

    "text": "YES!  I enjoyed my experience at Sushi House Goyemon!!!  We found this restaurant through YELP!  Thank you Yelp!!!  After reading the Yelp reviews, we expected a wait, but the night and time we went, there was no wait.  On the menu, it says that you have 60 minutes to eat.  You must eat everything you order and not leave a pile of rice or they will charge you per item.  I like the fact that they use YAMASA soy sauce!!!  For $26.95, you can get just about everything you want on the menu.  The items I liked the best were the yellowtail sushi, shrimp tempura, uni (only one order per person), crab meat sushi, and yellowtail collar.  The fish is fresh and cut Japanese style (smaller portions).  The only item I didn't like that much was the salmon sushi, so I only got one order of that.  The nigiri toro wasn't what I was expecting either.  Some of the other rolls looked good, but are big, so I didn't want to fill up on one roll.  The one roll I would have liked to try was the Spider roll.  For dessert, I had the green tea creme brulee which was pretty good.  The service is good.  There was only a few times when a server wasn't close by or when we had to wait to order something when we wanted.  I would definitely go back to Sushi House Goyemon!  See my pictures!  Xie Xie!!",

I was OBSESSED with their dessert particularly the yuzu sorbet. It was KILLER. And I've never had green tea brulee and that was equally dying for. Truthfully I can't remember any of the roll names BUT I can tell you that they were all so yummy--they would have to be if I feel they are replacing other well known AYCE places in the #1 spot.   One thing that I did not enjoy at all was one of the shrimp nigiri. It was the only one that you're allowed to get only one order of: sweet shrimp. The texture was very gelatinous and the flavor made me want to puke as I felt i was consuming someone's phlegm. Gross. Thinking about it makes me want to gag. So that's when you get some dessert to forget about the distress!!!!!  Anyway, this is my new sushi must-go place.",

We ordered all of our favorite sushi and rolls plus grilled pork belly.  It was a LOT of food.  When you order the sushi, they ask you how many.  Since it was my husband and myself, I said 2.  But the waiter didn't mean individual pieces but orders so it was like getting twice the amount of sushi I thought I ordered.  Tip:  next time, I want to have the feel of a whole meal from the AYCE so I'll only order sushi and maybe only one soft crab shell roll (because rolls are super filling) so that I'll have room for a poke salad, seaweed salad, grilled pork belly, and must have lychee sherbet!

We were seated immediately at the bar at lunchtime on a weekday.  Our drink orders and appetizer orders were taken immediately, and as soon as the sushi chef in front of us had a breather, we placed our sushi orders.  We ate a lot of food, but these were the highlights:  Sushi: White Tuna sushi Albacore sushi Freshwater Eel sushi  Appetizers: Fried Calamari Fried Soft Shell Crab Tuna Poke Octopus Poke Dynamite  Dessert: Tempura fried ice cream Lychee sorbet  The appetizers that came from the kitchen are all sized very small, which is great because you can taste them and if you like them, order more.    The only downside was that they don't offer Uni at lunchtime, and at dinnertime they limit you to one order per person : (.  But the fact that they include desserts with their AYCE is pretty great!    For about $50 for 2 people, this was a great deal, and really hit the spot when we were craving sushi!",

People are ordering crazy amounts of food. Most of the servers are on it!  I also love that you can take your time. There have been times when a group of friends and I have been there for almost 3 hours!   There are so many delicious items available for AYCE it's ridiculous but awesome. My favorite roll is the hurricane. Always check their daily specials board. Amazing grilled squid, cajun salmon, and unique fresh fishes. The garlic edamame is the way to go. Buttery, garlicky, little morsels of deliciousness! The shumai (fried) rock my socks off. I could go on and on about the deliciousness that is Goyemon!

This is my review on overall visits to Goyemon, things that stood out good and bad.  SERVICE: No greeting when entering the door or standing in front (3+ minutes to be greeted, no lie). Table not dry, no problem no biggie but can i get a dry napkin, lol. The waiters seemed to be in a rush while taking our order. Which made zero sense, place was barely half full with more than enough servers. One of the Bussers seemed like he knew what he was doing and was working hard and keeping a positive grin.  maybe he was high? Either way, wish he was serving us and not some spaz. Our order didnt come correctly as we asked, but they accidently dropped some half roll that we ate and it was yummy. lol.   FOOD: nigiri is what i push people to get at Goyemon. Salmon belly, yellow tail and white tuna have kept any stars i put up for this joint. Hands down, the nigiri quality is very tasty for an AYCE sushi spot. The pork belly used to be super tender and juicy, it fell off past few times. But, eh, pork isnt what i go to a sushi spot for anyways :) I'm Not a big fan of the rolls at Goyemon, i go to Oyshi for that. lol.   I guess after reading my own review, i took 2 stars off just because service sucks now. It was friendly, welcoming and comfortable. Now it seems like they rush you, forget you, then hate you. Wheres the love people. Practice Love FFS, lmao.. I tip 25% minimum everytime, 50% if i get service I love. if money can't buy a servers friendship then what does?",

    "text": "My first night in vegas and I stopped by decided to try this place out since it came so highly reviewed.   Our flight landed around 9pm and by the time we got settled in to the hotel it was closer to midnight. Thank god this is Vegas and not back home, where all the restaurant would have been closed!  I really liked the atmosphere of the place, nothing too fancy but not a run down place. The food was good, the prices were alot better than back home. My partner & I shared the Sashimi platter both times we were there and the first time was amazing! The second time was a miss, dont really know why. It was as if the freshness was not all there.   I would definitely come back, and I will!",

The last straw is when they decided to charge my 1 year old daughter a fee. It's not about the money but the fact she doesn't eat anything but a few bites here or there. We've been here many times and they never did this.",

    "text": "One of my top 3 AYCE Sushi places in vegas.  I tried a bunch and this one is among the best.   Good atmosphere, great appetizers and one of the few if only  also gives you unlimited desert ( not just one piece)  . There is usually always a wait during busy hours which is annoying but its worth it most of the time.  My only complaint is alot of the rolls are spicy or have spicy mayo on top of everything.   A lot of them seem repetitive.  The garlic edmome  is delicious.",

    "text": "Okay I waited a few days before I started typing this to really give it thought and come at you as objectively as possible...  First of all they have no egg rolls... Says it on the menu but they don't carry them ....however  Here is my main problem with this place...   It's owned by SushiMon which is an absolute terrible sushi restaurant in Henderson it's so so terrible in fact they had to make a new one name it this and make an entirely new website about it to get far away from the name of sushi that sushimon messes up on ...   The major problem I have with them is they are extremely unorganized and do not show any kind of professionalism which is why I swore I would never eat there again...  However Goyemon suckered me in and made me eat a SushiMon Product... which kind of made me mad as I was pretty darn disappointing with what was being presented and asked if they had any other restaurants in the area and that's when that bomb was dropped on me.  As far as the pictures on their website goes I'm not sure if they hired a food artist but what those pictures portray versus what you get is night and day and I would have rather eaten the food during the night... in PITCH BLACK DARKNESS so I didn't have to look at it as it had absolutely no visual appeal but it tasted \"okay\" since I was starving and had just got finished watching drifting at the motor speedway OK back on track..(hah!)... The Tuna Poke was grey and the chicken teriyaki looked like the yolk of an egg after it was boiled...it looked rather sickly ... the rolls are over-sauced with a whole bunch of stuff that doesn't allow you to taste any of the fish quality, which ... is probably a good thing... I used a lot of wasabi while partaking in their fare just in case something was sitting out too long somewhere.    The reason why I gave this place 2 stars is simply because their lychee sorbet was phenomenal and I loved it... It was the saving grace... Other then that I was sorely disappointed to find out that this was just another SushiMon wrapped in new clothing to try to hide the garbage that their flagship created...",

    "text": "Let me start by saying I only like traditional sushi and nigiri, basically those with rice and a slice of fish. And unfortunately this place does not deliver. Their nigiri are poorly made, the rice is mushy with no texture and don't even get me started on the sad little piece of fish that they put on top. Needless to say, I did not enjoy my meal and did not have an enjoyable time. For me, making good traditional sushi and sashimi is the foundation for a good sushi house and this place failed that basic expectation.  Now if you like non-traditional rolls, this is the place for you. My companion is all about mixed rolls and loved how he can order half rolls. Cream cheese, tempura flakes, sweet eel sauce, asparagus... you name it and they have it. From his expression and profuse praise, I gathered they are well-made and quite delicious.  So I'm going to stick to places who can make traditional sushi, but for those who like mixed rolls, you might find your heaven here.",

    "text": "You know, after reading all the reviews I was really excited to try this sushi joint. It was packed when I got there which is always a good sign you know they are moving a lot of product and everything was FRESH FRESH FRESH. So why three stars? To begin, the sushi its self was cut and prepared right, but I felt constantly harassed to order my next item and could never relax and savor the experience. The rice was the right texture, and I felt the portion was good. Hot dishes take quite a bit of time to come out so be sure to order them in advance. The conch special was incredible, but I did't care for their saba or hamachi, I've had much better at other establishments.  In my experience they are a good sushi restaurant, but I'm not sure about all the hype? I'll have to try it again.",

As for the food, its ok, the rolls i like are Red Dragon, Sexy Girls, and Hurricane, other than that.....nah . Oh yeah, Nigiri, i understand is AYCE, but ive never seen such tiny nigiri in my life, or all the AYCE sushi ive been in the past. Not mention that we found hair in the sushi, and told our server, what she said was : uh ok, would you like another new one? WHAT???.....no apologize or report to mgr,  do notthing about it.   All in all, i will not going back for sure, there are tons AYCE sushi in the Vegas; going back to sushi mon and extreme sushi ( SH area one) next time.",

I enjoy coming here with great friends and family and taking advantage of their all you can eat sushi special, it's always my preferred choice if your a sushi lover. The one thing that stands out to me and a must try! Is the pork belly. This dish is addicting melt in your mouth teriyaki glazed goodness. I could never get enough of that dish. Also if your a spicy kind of person you must try the 911 roll, tried it last night with some friends as a dog dare and maybe next time we'll do the extra spicy for shites and giggles....  The friendly staff and ambiance is welcoming from beginning to end. Your greeted when you walk into the doors with \"irrasshaimase\" by the sushi chefs. However the wait at times maybe long but that's because this place is the BOMB! I don't mind waiting 20-40mins. for a table, maybe not at other sushi places. But at this place waiting for table is worth it once you get seated..",

    "text": "I had almost given up on all you can eat sushi because generally the quality is sacrificed greatly.  However my boyfriend eats so darn much that I had to keep searching.  We had come to goyemon a long time ago when I was super hungry and opted out while everyone gorged themselves, but this time I was armed with intense hunger.  I like that the nigiri  are not so inundated with rice that they overwhelm the fish.  The garlic tuna was super fresh and had an awesome light sauce which I believe was elevated with some yuzu.  The ikura was freaking awesome, fresh and perfect seasoned which is hard to find.  I also loved some baked green muscles the sauce was so yummy and not bland like some places, and the muscles were not to big.  I prefer smaller sized because the bigger ones can get a bit chewy.  I like that you can order half rolls and that they have more unique desserts like chocolate mousse and green tea creme brule.  The green tea creme brule could have used more of a firm sugar top is was more speckled that a layer of crunchyness.  The chocolate mousse was the perfect size for how rich it was.  I did notice some of the cuts of fish got a little less consistent towards the very end......we ordered a lot for two people.  Our server kept up with us pretty awesome for how busy it was, and the food came out very quickly.  So for being an all you can eat place I believe they earned 5 stars.",

I'm more of a nigiri person but there are a few rolls that I like to have from time to time. my favorite nigiri include: garlic tuna, super white tuna, yellowtail, salmon belly, and sweet shrimp. try whatever they have on their specials board if you're feeling adventurous!   I like that you can order half portions of most of the rolls so you have try a roll and not worry about have to eat 8 pieces of it if you don't like it. they also do small portions of appetizers too! which is good if you just want to try something.   their desserts are awesome! I always get the yuzu sherbet and the green tea creme brulee  and my boyfriend will get the tempura ice cream. all so yummy!   so if you're craving sushi and have time to spare...goyemon is the place!",

It's such a good deal and the fresh is relatively fresh.  If you're not into sushi they have other options as well.  Till next time Goyemon!",
