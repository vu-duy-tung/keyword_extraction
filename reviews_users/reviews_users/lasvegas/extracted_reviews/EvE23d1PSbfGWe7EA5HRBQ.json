After the first few minutes of Po and his dad talking about noodles, I was done for. I looked up the nearest (and best rating) noodle place around me, and lo and behold The Magic Noodle came up. Although the restaurant itself is quite small, the food is by far worth the wait and the small dining space. Watching the chefs hand-pull noodles and cook your meal was definitely a highlight. And the food. OH, the FOOD. Delicious. Simply delicious. My husband and I got 2 separate orders (because I wasn't about to share with him lol), and the portions were hefty enough for us to 1) be full and 2) take the leftovers home. If I could give more than 5 stars, I would. I'll be returning.",

We thought the noodles would be magical ! We also tried there most popular soup. I'm sure the soup tasted like it was supposed too, but it just wasn't for us. The broth just had a very interesting flavor I could not handle. It was hard to communicate with our server due to a language Barrier which also made things difficult. Lastly , the place could have been a lil bit cleaner .",

They both have their unique styles of Chinese pulled noodles. This is one of the best noodle places in Vegas. Forget Chinatown in Las Vegas, this place is located discretely in the Summerlin area. But nevermind that, the food is main star. I had the spicy cold beef as an appetizer and then the Szechuan beef brisket soup. The cold beef was delicious, you can definitely taste the pepper and it numbs your mouth a little. The soup was the best; definitely try the knife cut style noodles. They were chewy but still tender. They absorbed the rich broth and the beef brisket was so tender it melted. The soup might of said spicy but it was not too overwhelming. I had just about every last drop. Feeling chilly outside or just wanna feel warm ? Come to this place. But this place is so good I'm still going to come here on the hot summer days of Vegas because it's that amazing.",

Noodles are made in house right there so you can stare and watch and make them feel awkward, but they don't haha. Very awesome and polite staff. We've dined in and taken out numerous times and not have any issues with them.  We usually order fried rice and some noodle soup. Beef brisket is my Go To soup there. Meat always tender and of course juicy, cuz well, it's in soup. I've eaten the Shrimp, Chicken and Beef fried rice, all depends on what I want determines what I'll eat. Any of these choices or even the house fried rice is good as well  The place can get busy so plan accordingly",

These guys just hit it right on the spot. The noodles are hand pulled per order, so make sure you take a seat next to the Chef's island, to get the spectacular view of how your noods will be prepared.   The menu is relatively compact yet there are quite a bit of options to choose from. Here's my typical order:   Onion pancakes - 5.95 USD (deliciously crisp and full of buttery goodness)   And/or (depending on how hungry I am) spicy dumplings Szechuan style - 6.50 USD (bursting with flavours, boldly manifesting spices)  Szechuan beef brisket noodle soup - 8.95 USD (you will here the mouth watering aroma of the soup when it will just start making the way to your table - it's the God of all the soups to me, with perfectly chewy fresh pulled noodles).  Parking could be a bit of the hurdle during dinner time but, trust me, the food is absolutely worth the hassle.",

I think the servers was just feeling the rush and had tunnel vision but I had to get up and get someone after waving my arms 5 times. That's where they lost the star.  The food is great! I love the braised beef noodles, spicy wontons, and spicy Szechuan dumplings. Delicious broth and perfect amount of heat in the dumplings.

The hand-pulled noodles are sooooo good, and the texture is just perfect, not too chewy nor too soft. If you prefer chewier, you can opt for the knife-shaved or the flat, wide noodles. You can also watch them make your magical noodles fresh behind the glass in their open kitchen.  My favorite items include:  -Szechuan beef noodle  -spicy pork ribs noodle -Dan Dan noodle -Mongolian beef chow mein  -House special fried rice -spicy wonton -homemade style cucumber -sweet and sour black fungus salad (yes that says fungus) -Chinese beef burrito   -steamed chicken with chili sauce    The food and service are amazing, and the prices are very reasonable.

I watched the guy through this glass window and it was very amusing watching him throw it up in the air and twirl it all around and pound it on his table. I couldn't download the video on here. I got the shrimp and vegetable with broccoli chow mein and it was really good. I normally don't like flour noodles because I prefer pan fried egg noodles because flour noodles are slightly thicker and usually the sauce is too much but their sauce wasn't too salty and it was flavorful. So they make their noodles three styles. Original, flat and knife cut. The knife cut is thicker than the original. So I got my chow mein with the original style noodles. They also have noodle soups and and some appetizers there and some salads and sides. Not a very big menu. The restaurant is small and just with 1 or 2 waiters and customer service is good. I would come back again and try their soup and other items on their menu.",

    "text": "First and foremost: food = I was prepared for what to expect as I have been to Shang Artisan Noodle and Noodle Man.  I learned from last time that knife cut noodle is cool but original or rounded noodle is more of my favorite texture and just tastes better to me.  I ordered the Szechuan Beef Brisket with original pulled noodle and I was very pleased overall.  I think if you aren't familiar with this style of asian noodle soup, you might be surprised expecting ramen house flavors (miso, shoyu, shio) or udon.  This flavoring is similar to the Chinese 5-Spice that you might taste at asian buffet offerings.  I like the spicy aspect of it (Szechuan) and the beef was fork tender - or should I say chopstick tender.   I loved the beef pancake, tastes like a deep fried wonton with a hint of black bean flavoring, not sure if they include that.  Mongolian Beef ChowMein was a bit on the sweet side and better for those who don't want the soupy noodles.  Overall I liked the food and go back to try again.   Ambiance/Service: maybe because it is a new and upcoming place but it was a bit of a long wait.  Also the seating itself is very limited so they can't seat as many.  It was perplexing why they would have a party of 1 be sat at one of the larger booths enough for 4, but seat a group of 2 or more at the counter...that was the only part of the experience I thought was disappointing.  Overall, service was friendly and the upside to sitting at the counter was to be up close and personal with the noodle pullers/makers and chefs - a little insider!",

Our waitress did not have the best English but thankfully, we speak Chinese and the owner or manager was also very helpful.   Our beef noodle soups came out fairly quickly and we also enjoyed some cold side dishes and spicy wontons. In addition, the stir fried pork belly and string bean noodles took a little longer to come out. I would have also liked the string beans to be cooked a little more, they seemed to be steamed and then stir fried in.   My family greatly enjoyed their noodle soups and the side dishes. I loved the spicy wontons and it's always great to see any place making fresh noodles in their restaurant. I give extra props since it is a difficult and tedious task to do.   The pricing is extremely reasonable and their menu reminds me of the Noodle Man and Shang's. However, I really did enjoy this restaurant and will definitely be back, especially since it is so close to home.   We went when it first opened and I'm positive it has gotten even better since we have been there. We look forwarded to going back in the future!",

    "text": "I have been searching for a new noodle place here in Vegas that compared to the chinese noodle house I loved in New York City; I have found my new favorite noodle joint here at Magic Noodle House.  I came with my dad and nana after being recomended this place from one of my coworkers. The staff were fast to seat us and to give us time to look over the menu; our waiter Alex was fantastic during our entire stay. He made sure to check on us and give us time for questions if we needed, once we put our orders in they were fast to get us our sodas. I asked for a fork for my nana since she wasnt very good at chopsticks, and Alex made sure to give us a fork for evrry dish so she would alwayd have a fresh clean fork!  I got the Pork Belly and Bean Sprout noodle dish with the wide flat noodles (minus the bean sprouts), we also got the house fried rice and mongolian beef noodles.   It took a few minutes for them to cook our food but we were able to enjoy the scenery of the joint; simple modern decor, nothing flashy or overwhelming but it allowed us to focus in on the kitchen which is surrounded by glass and you can watch the chefs stretch fresh home made noodles! So amazing to watch!  Our food came out and the portions were HUGE! so much flavour on all the dishes and my dad was so impressed with the fried rice especially. I almost cried from joy over how big my noodles were and how tender the pork belly was; seriously the best I have had EVEN WHEN I WAS IN NYC!   Not only will I be coming back to get some pictures for this review, I will be dragging every person I know to this noodle house to ensure this business succeeds and stays here forever.  If possible please open another location in North Las Vegas, until then TOTALLY WORTH THE DRIVE.",

The noodle soup was also a great choice, noodles had great texture and broth had a nice kick, I highly recommend it. I would come back and check out more of their menu.",

    "text": "Didn't realize how popular this noodle joint was - ended up randomly choosing it as a destination point for my friend and me, and I was incredibly surprised at how busy the small noodle shop was.   The Magic Noodle is located in a pretty busy plaza with Infusion Tea Lounge and Makai Pacific, but parking is super easy to find (thank you, Vegas!). This shop is quite tiny, with a lot of tables crammed into the dining area for max capacity. Noodles are made by hand - they have an open kitchen, which allows for you to see what the chefs are doing. If you happen to come right when they're pulling the noodles, you're in for a treat!   The menu is not too extensive - soup noodles, sauce noodles, stir-fried noodles, fried rice, and appetizers. And they do have vegetarian options! All noodle options can be hand pulled (original style or flat-wide style) or be knife-cut.   I went with the my-go choice - the beef brisket noodle with the noodles being flat-wide style ($8.95). Not spicy at all and the broth had so much flavor! I loved that there was a good amount of cilantro sprinkled on top, and I was surprised at how many pieces of beef brisket I kept ladling up! Beef was tender and incredibly flavorful. Loved the richness of the broth; while it was a little on the oily side, it still tasted incredible. But the noodles definitely took this dish and made it infinitely better. I absolutely love thick/flat noodles in soup broth, and The Magic Noodle made it so well! Super chewy but the noodles helped retain flavor from the broth, making me want to eat more and more. I had enough for dinner that night because the dish felt like it was pretty endless.   My friend ordered the tomato and egg noodle soup - I think he wasn't a fan of the over easy egg on top of the bowl of noodles, but he said the flavor was good and he liked the texture of the noodles.   We also split the sweet and sour cucumbers ($4.95). I thought the appetizer had a good amount of acidity from the vinegar, and the garlic definitely packed a punch. It wasn't out of the world amazing though since my aunt makes a pretty mean cucumber dish herself. It was refreshing and a good way to start the meal. I don't think I'd order this again though.   Workers are super friendly and helpful. People are in and out pretty quickly, so you don't have to wait too long for a table.   tl;dr - love the noodles that they make at The Magic Noodle. It's a little away from the Strip, but definitely worth the drive. Big fan of the beef brisket noodle with the wide-flat noodle! And prices are very affordable, which makes it all the more better.",

The noodles were great and the dumplings had a very tasty level of heat.  It's cool watching the kitchen make the noodles fresh as you wait.

    "text": "I learned about this place from Philip T's noodle shots.  Never have I felt the chewiness of noodles by simply looking at photos, but somehow The Magic Noodle pulled it off.   On a recent trip w/ friends to Vegas, we drove about 15 min. from The Strip to come eat here. At 8pm, there were others in line. There's no room inside, so we all waited outside in the 100 degrees LV evening. About 20 min later, it was our turn.   I ordered the Szechuan spicy beef brisket noodle. Great broth flavor and not too spicy, very tolerable. The beef was so tender and almost melts in your mouth. I'd def get it again.   Also tried the spicy beef shank & tenderloin as an appetizer.  Nice flavor, just a little spicy.  Can't speak for the others in our party but the consensus was everybody liked it.   Noodles are hand pulled or knife cut. There's a glass with a view into the kitchen to see them perform their 'magic'. The results; the noodles are perfectly chewy and works so well with their flavorful broth. I would come back, but driving the distance and waiting in the heat is a small deterrent. But it's worth at least one visit.   Notes:  * Large shared parking lot * Put your name on the sign-in sheet as soon as you arrive.  * They close at 10pm, but even at 9, there's a short wait.  * While waiting outside, there are no seats.",

    "text": "A friend recently introduced me to Magic Noodle and after that first visit I was compelled to tell other friends about it and to start making return trips for lunch.  My recommendations after several visits include:  Appetizers:  I highly recommend the House Special Pancakes or the Spicy Wonton.  Or just get both.  You'll thank me later.  Soups:  I can definitely recommend the two I've tried so far:  Lan Zhou Noodle, and Chong Qing Style Spicy Noodle.  I need to be disciplined and try others as well, but both of these are so good, it's hard to force myself to give something else a try.  Even so, absolutely everything I've seen brought out looks tempting.  Now read on; you'll have some choices to make when you order:  Types of noodles.  All the noodles are hand made right there in the restaurant.  In fact, the magic happens right behind a glass wall separating diners from the kitchen, and it's pretty cool to watch as the noodles are being stretched/pulled by hand.  If you have kids, bring them--they'll be as fascinated as you are to watch.  When you order, you'll have the choice between original noodles, flat noodles, or knife cut.  They're all good, but give the knife cut noodles a try.  Rather than being uniform in shape, they're literally cut by hand and you'll end up with a variety of sizes and shapes in your broth.  The waiters will always be happy to recommend a noodle type deepening on the broth you're going to enjoy.    Types of broth.  Speaking of broth, ask the waiter to explain the varieties.  There are six or seven different broths available based on the various soups you chose.  You may want to focus on the broth when you order rather than just what's floating in it.  The staff is awesome!  They'll obviously talk to you about the menu, but one of the best things about everyone I've spoken with there is they seem genuinely excited about the restaurant.  Parking:  The Magic Noodle is in a storefront, and there's always sufficient parking available.  So many delicious choices and at a very reasonable price!  If you enjoy noodles and haven't tried Magic Noodles, treat yourself and add a Chinese noodle house to your noodle house options!",

The broth was absolutely amazing- perfect combination of hot and sour and had huge slices of fish.   We chose two types of noodles and I'm a bigger fan of the knife cut noodles (thick and chewy!) than the flat wide hand pulled noodles (got soggy after a few min in the broth).   Also recommend trying the sliced pork with garlic sauce- tender pork and lots of minced garlic. Just wish it was spicier! The house special pancakes were just oversized gyoza. Nothing too special. The beef filling was flavorful and juicy though.  Food came out really slow, so it was nice to be able to watch the noodle making from the dining area. Service was ok. Good location in the SW, fair prices, good portions- 4 stars",

    "text": "Before I thought about writing a review for this joint, I wanted to visit this place several times. So, after four visits, I finally feel like I have an unbiased opinion of this establishment. This place is an outstanding combination of great prices, quality and service. Every visit has been consistent for me. Looking at the menu, every item is priced very well and you get a lot of food for your money. You won't ever feel like you are overpaying for anything.   When you receive whatever item you order, the quality is there. Everything is so tasty and fresh. You can even get a sense of that the moment you walk in, as you smell the fresh dough being made. A little more detail about the food... you have a choice of three noodle types: hand pulled, knife cut or flat noodles. I've tried all three and they are so chewy, which is exactly how I love my noodles. Many of the items are spicy as well, so if you need to have them tone it down, then simply ask. Their appetizers are also very tasty. Just try one at random.  This place is a bit on the small side, but I like that kind of \"hole in the wall\" feel to it. Unlike other holes in walls, you get to see the cooks in action from beginning to end, so enjoy the free noodle pulling show! Because the place is small, it's usually very crowded so you should expect some waiting time especially if you go during peak dining hours. The servers are always hustling and making sure every table is covered. They seem to have a joint effort system there, where all servers cover all tables evenly to insure that all customers are attended to properly. I've never had to ask for a water refill and I've never had to repeatedly ask for anything. They bus the tables themselves and have everything ready for the next customer to sit right away. Very impressive. On one of my visits, I had the privilege of meeting the owner \"Andy\". I've seen him actually pull noodles himself on one occasion. I think that says a lot about him as an owner.  I think this place is a definite must-try. You get a lot of bang for your buck here. I'm determined to try everything on their menu! Oh! Don't forget to sign in as soon as you arrive!",

When I see the words \"Spicy beef noodle soup\" c4 and  fresh hand pulled noodles\", I get more excited than I should, and fear I will never burn off the calories to justify my noodle habit.   One caveat: I think the soup, at least the spicy one, goes better with the hand pulled noodles than the knife shaved. I enjoy a doughy noodle every now and then but it's almost like they soak up too much spice.   If for some reason, you come to magic noodle, and don't want noodles. The house fried rice and appetizers are bomb too...detour  Literally (not literally but almost literally) everything tastes better with the chili oil from the spicy Wontons. I know it's just(?) chili oil but maybe it's the flavor the wontons leave behind that make it taste better than straight up chili oil. I like to use it for as many different non soup items as I can. End detour  Seeing the word burrito gave me pause but the burritos and pancakes (A3 was my choice) at this Chinese restaurant are quite good. The sweet and sour cucumber, B5 are a refreshing treat as well. I could easily imagine coming here splitting a bowl of noodles (I haven't tried it yet so I don't know if there's an associated fee) and splitting two or three appetizers the cucumbers might be necessary if only to make me feel less guilty about all the carbs (bonus that they taste good).",

We were seated probably in about a 20 minute time frame and we had a party of 3 so it was pretty reasonable and it was about 8:30 at night. We had a front row seat to the noodle making as well and our 7 year old loved that. The waiter was on top of everything and thanks to yelp we saved a lot of time and already knew what we wanted.   I got the brisket noodle bowl soup , daughter got chicken fried rice and husband got he Mongolian beef chow mein  I was kind of disappointed in the brisket because it was sooooo fatty, like extremely fatty very large chunks. All white pieces . And that's my only complaint. So for that bowl being all the rave that was the only let down. Noodles and broth were amazing. Chicken fried rice was absolutely amazing. The Mongolian beef chow mein was great and perfect amount of spice .  The service was very fast and the mason jar waters are a great touch. Will definitely be returning here again and can't wait to try other dishes!",

I ordered kung pao chicken and it was basically chicken mixed with noodles which I wasn't expecting, but it was pretty good regardless. Ive found that most dishes are heavy on sauces. I've gone several times, but would be there more frequently if they had protein dishes with rice as an option.  The restaurant itself is a small, modern place with adequate dining space, but the staff is awesome. Everyone I spoke with every time was friendly, inviting, and accommodating.",

The wontons have the perfect texture, not soggy at all and you can taste the meatiness of the filling without the heat overpowering the dish. Would order two of these next time. Don't let the chili in the name stop you from getting them!  Also ordered the szechuan beef brisket noodle soup and the reviews weren't kidding, the beef is super tender!! Plus there were plenty of it. We had it with the original noodles and I'm not too particular about noodles but the bf said the soup doesn't really hold onto the noodles well but it's a soupy soup you know. Cooked al dente. Broth was also light and not too oily which was surprising. No msg here!  And last, we had the combination chow mein. Again the sauce doesn't stick well on the noodles but the flavor was all there. Simple but satisfying, would like it to be a tad bit more saucy but that's my preference. Lots of veggies and meat (shrimp, beef, chicken, spam?). Good enough for two people too.   Definitely coming back again, especially for those wontons!!",

The shaved noodles are perfect to my preference. Great chewiness, not too long, not too short. The broth was delicious but I've had better. The beef was so tender and just melted in my mouth. Hands down, there isn't a beef brisket noodle soup in Vegas that can compare.  My wife got the black fungus and the chicken and mushroom soup with the wide noodles. The broth was pretty good, there were a ton of mushrooms and the chicken wasn't dry as I was half expecting, especially for white meat. The wide noodles had great texture but they were extremely long and it just felt like the noodle was too overwhelming for the dish and took away from the flavor. I would personally prefer a thinner noodle that would be able to absorb more flavor and broth. The black fungus was awesome. The last time I had it was probably in my childhood when my parents ordered it somewhere. Definitely something I wouldn't have ordered on my own. It had great crunch and texture with a nice sweet and sour flavor. My wife loved it, we would probably order it again.   I looked over and saw that someone had ordered the pork belly and string beans noodle stir fry. It looked so on point! My wife hates fatty meat and even she was eyeing that dish. That and/or the Mongolian chow mein is on the to try list for our next visit. And there WILL be a next visit. Probably tomorrow. It was that good. I'm excited to try some more apps.",

I ordered the following:  Appetizers: - Wontons in chili oil (not too spicy and the wontons skins were fresh and soft.  The meatball inside was flavorful and juicy) - House Special Pancakes (slightly crispy and the meat inside was juicy, but it made the pancake outside a little soggy. The vinegar that came with it was such a great dipping sauce.  I also used the chili oil from the wontons for this too)  Entree: - Szechuan Beef Brisket Noodle with the wide noodles (I personally like my pasta a little al dente and that's the texture of the wide noodles.  It's a little thicker, with slightly more chew.  The beef was tender and flavorful.  The soup base was sooo flavorful and not spicy.  Don't be deterred by the all the chili oil-- it's not bad at all)  Service: Their staff was welcoming and friendly.  Great service every time I visited and you can tell the server was really passionate about their food.  I don't know how you can ignore some of these noodle pics.  Try this place out!",

It was so so sooooo satisfying watching them make the noodles while slurping on their delicious bowl of noodles. I got their chicken with mushroom and the guys got some of their spicier broth which was freaken amazing!! We ordered their spicy wontons and the beef tripe as an appetizer. The waiter definitely recommended the tripe and he was totally right! He said he gets it all the time on the side during his lunch. The spice level was perfect and the flavor was amazing. The spicy wonton, I couldn't eat but the boys were raving on how it's probably the best one they've had by far because the chili oil that it was soaked it was just perfect. The noodles were tender and chewy + all the broths were just simply satisfying. I pretty much got all the broth splattered all over my dress after I was done haha. I ate like I was a toddler.. haha! I didn't care because it was so good. I can't wait to try their stir fry noodles next. Until next time! Happy eating my fellow Yelpers!",

This place is located off strip, which is nice because we usually stay on strip. We came here for lunch, and there was a bit of a wait but we didn't wait too long for a table for 4. I had the spicy beef noodle soup with wide noodles, and it was delicious. The broth had the right amount of spice and was very flavorful. The beef was really tender and fatty, which I love. The beef was just delicious. And the noodles had a good amount of bite. My girls had regular noodles and the knife cut noodles, and we all agreed the wide noodles were the best. I made the right choice, haha. The other noodles were still good, though. It was fun watching them pull the noodles. Even watching them make the knife cut noodles was pretty cool. We also had the spicy won tons and beef wrap. SO. GOOD. Yum. I highly recommend this place if you're looking for a relatively inexpensive and delicious meal off the strip.

Walking into the small restaurant to say that we had nine people with us, the server laughed and told us we can either split up into two booths (five minute wait) or wait until the center table finishes (which they just sat down and just received their waters). We agreed to splitting up because the booths were next to each other anyways. The restaurant seemed clean and you can see the man behind the window pulling the noodles. Imagine doing that all day long everyday, what a work out.  There were a lot of items on the menu that had a little chili pepper next to it representing that it's spicy, but since I can't handle spicy, I ordered a plain bowl of wontons. My boyfriend and my friends all ordered different types of spicy noodles (my non-asian friend surprisingly liked his bowl of flat noodles even though it was new and completely unexpected from what he believed he had ordered). My wonton soup came out first after a few minutes of ordering, even before the beef roll appetizers that we had ordered - which was a bit weird because I didn't want to eat before everyone else at the table and my wontons were basically cooled by the time everyone else got their food. The beef rolls were alright, it was literally a little piece of meat stuffed into some type of dough/wrapping that got fried. The wonton soup was average. The noodle soups that everyone else didn't really amaze them in anyway, it was good but not a WOW factor. Also, as I've told, you shouldn't be afraid to order extra spicy which was what my friends did and they still didn't think that it was spicy enough.  I would stop by here again if I was a local, it's a good cheap meal. The bill came out to only $14 a person and that included 20% tip!",

We got there at the end of the lunch rush on a weekday and had to wait, but it was worth it.   We got the chicken and mushroom noodles and the spicy beef Szechuan. We also had the spicy won tons for an appetizer. All of it was delicious. It was all great but the noodles was the star of the show, here. I'm assuming that the noodles are all hand made in house. You can see a guy making noodles in the window to the kitchen. We had good service, but keep in mind that it is tight seating. We also had canned sodas instead of fountain drinks (just an FYI, if that matters to you).  We will definitely be coming back!",

If you follow their page on IG - every single photo of noodle pulls makes you want to drive over to this restaurant and inhale their entire menu. I had an appointment over on this side of town last month and stopped by for a quick lunch. I ordered the pickles as a cold app and the Szechuan Beef Brisket Noodle with knife shaved noodles.   The brisket was a little fatty for my liking (usually hit or miss at restaurants) but the broth was full of flavor, balanced with the perfect amount of heat. The fresh knife shaved noodles definitely did not disappoint!   The pickles never came out (sad day - the server did apologize for forgetting) so I will have to try another time. It's a bit far from where I live to frequent - however, if was ever in the area, I wouldn't be opposed to going back!",

So it's basically up to preference. We ordered one with original and one with flat noodles. If you like thicker noodles then I suggest getting the flat noodles. The beef brisket was very tender and soft, probably the best beef brisket I've had. Besides from the beef, the soup had plenty of flavor. I also enjoyed the spicy wontons and would recommend it to everyone.",

They need a better waiting area outside. If you come late or during the high peak hours, you gotta go to the ice cream shop next door or wait outside standing. If it's too cold or too hot outside, good luck.  Hopefully they will expand or give out beepers so you can wait in your car.",

The menu is not super extensive but I don't like a long-winded menu haha  I got the Dan Dan noodles, scallion pancakes, and a few more items that are escaping my memory. Everything was yummy but not nearly as spicy as I thought. The server was kind enough to offer chilis cooked in oil and I immediately jumped at the chance. The addition of the chilis definitely elevated the dishes.  I heard no complaints from any of the other ladies so I take it everyone enjoyed what they ordered. The noodle soup bowls are quite hefty so be mindful if you're going to be ordering a bunch!",

I really like their knife cut noodles with anything. My personal favorites were the mongolian beef chow mein, burrito, and the beef brisket soup.   Last night when I came in, it was really busy and the service was soo slow. We had to wait a long time for them to take our order. The table we were sat at was dirty and the condiments on the table like soy sauce were so filthy and sticky.   The thing that did it for me was when they delivered our waters. It wasn't filled to the top and the ice was melted like it had been sitting out for a long time. The cup itself was so dirty that I felt like they just gave us a cup of water from the last customer that didn't finish theirs. My bf wiped the inside of my cup with a napkin and was actually able to wipe off some suspicious residue. Needless to say, I didn't drink water for the rest of my meal.  I still gave 2 stars because the food is really good. However, I wouldn't want to eat at a restaurant that I feel is not clean.",

    "text": "I met up with a dear friend of mine and had seen this spot was close to him.   Craving a comforting meal, and good company, I ventured across town to make this happen.  Very soon after arriving the restaurant became super packed, which I took as a good sign. They had many yummy looking options, but I had been craving  spicy beef noodle soup, and hoped theirs would make me all warm and fuzzy.   I got the knife cut noodles for my soup, and first off let me say the noodles were the best I have ever had. They had just the right amount of chew,  and the meat was tender and plentiful.  The broth however was a bit one note for me,  and underdeveloped in flavor.  I only ate half my soup because without a delicious broth,  I got a bit bored with the soup.   The place smelled amazing,  and I will try to order another dish next time that maybe highlights their exceptional noodles in a better light.",

    "text": "I would give this place about 3 1/4 stars if it was possible.   It's popular, and the interior is small. There was about a 15 minute wait on a weeknight for a table. You sign up on a clipboard hanging near the entrance.   We were offered two seats at the counter directly in view of the kitchen where the noodles are being made. You have a great view of this process which is cool.   They have a very limited beverage selection. No soda fountain and cans of Coke, Sprite, and Fanta Orange only. No diet drinks. Weird and disappointing.   The beef pancakes were very good. Crispy pancake surrounding juicy and tasty beef.   You can choose from a variety of different noodle types including original or knife cut.   I tried the Mongolian beef chow mein. The beef was fairly tender. The noodles were pretty good though not as amazing as I had imagined for a place that makes them in house. The sauce had a very heavy Chinese five spice taste. That was pretty much the flavor of the entire dish, and it was pretty overwhelming. I would've preferred a more complex and nuanced flavor rather than being overwhelmed with the five spice taste.   Service was ok overall though you had to flag someone down if you wanted more water.   Overall this was an ok experience but didn't seem to live up to the hype.",

The food itself is great, the noodles are sooooooo good and the prices are very reasonable. It's a sit down restaurant, but nothing too fancy. Downside, the service was so slow. I went on a Tuesday at 6 pm. All the tables were full and it took 45 minutes to get our food which was a bowl of soup and chow main. The poor table next to us waited for over an hour for their food. It took their server 30 minutes to bring them their hot tea. I needed leftover containers and got sick of waiting, so I went and grabbed them myself along with the check, and left cash at the table all without our server even knowing. Keep in mind the  dining area is small.  Yep, it was that bad. I am going to chalk it up to them being a new restaurant and still working out the kinks. I'll be back in a month or two.",

The restaurant is really nice - they've done a fantastic job of decorating, and the kitchen is open so you can see the chef making the hand-pulled noodles and doing all of the food preparation.  We were greeted immediately and given a table and menus.  We do wish the menus had descriptions of the items so that we could better know what they were.  My daughter and I split the Chicken Fried Rice and Chicken Chow Mein.  The Fried Rice was to die for, and the best we have ever had!  The Chow Mein was delicious as well, and the noodles had great texture - we went with the original noodle, but next time may try a different style.  Overall, we were very pleased with our meal, although they do not have Diet Coke which we're hoping they will decide to get in for the future as that would have made our meal perfect.  We will definitely be going back!",

    "text": "Wanted some noodles on a cold night and visited The Magic Noodle for the first time. The restaurant is pretty small and it gets pretty crowded but we got seated within a few minutes of arriving. We ordered the Szechuan Beef Brisket Noodle, Chicken with Mushroom and Noodle and the Braised Pork Belly with String Beans Stir-fried Noodles. The food was delicious, the broths were great and the thick noodles in the stir fry was delicious. The food is definitely 5-star worthy and it is super cool to see them pulling the noodles through the clear window in the kitchen. The reason I give this place 4-stars is due to the service. The service is pretty slow. The one girl that was waitressing, you could tell she was trying really hard to keep up with everyone. What was annoying was seeing the other younger guy that was working as a waiter moving so slow. He was waiting by the kitchen for the food to be put up or standing at the register while the poor girl was almost jogging between tables. We had to wait awhile before getting our waters and our orders taken. After getting our waters, we noticed one had a bug in it and the male waiter said it's just lemon in the water and we said look at it, it's a bug and then just walked away with the water and brought another one back without saying anything else. Overall though, highly recommend their food, you will definitely not be disappointed!",

The best part is you get to watch them from the kitchen hand pulling the noodles.   We started out with the app that was a shanghai style dumpling in a spicy oil and green onions, def recommend!   I got the most popular soup noodle dish that had a delicious broth. The one I got wasn't as spicy but they have the same exact spice paste they use in the kitchen you can use on the counter so I spiced mine up to my liking! SO yummy!   My boyfriend got the chow mein garlic noodles with ham, shrimp and chicken. He loved his as well!   Highly recommend.. I'll definitely be coming back on our next Vegas trip!",

    "text": "So not to be an asshole but I held off on publishing this review for a few month solely on the fact that I wanted to keep this spot on the DL as long as possible...   Well looking that the love that's on Yelp now, I guess that the secrets out...   Fresh Hand pulled Taiwanese noodles is one of those cuisines that the Vegas area has been lacking for some time which only in recent years has seen an uptick in the category. Anyhow, this place is a great example of quality dining that bucks the stigma held against the Chinese restaurants.   My default order,  Onion pancakes: some pan fried goodness.  Spicy wonton(A4) (sometimes 2 orders just for me) this is such a simple dish but their spicy sauce is one of the best that I have ever had. I'm not sure if it's Szechuan or shishito peppers but it give you a cool numbing taste to accompany the kick from spicy sauce when you eat the won tons.  Szechuan brisket noodles (C4) with large noodles. The traditionalists will say that this dish was meant to have thin noodles but I tend to disagree. The thick noodles stay firmer in the soup and help balance the the spice of the dish. I feel that the thin noodles get lost in the sauce. The soup is also very robust and hearty. Prior to eating the magic here, DTF's braised beef version was my favorite but no more!   Beef Brisket Noodle (C3) is usually the default choice for the lady. This is your prototypical beef base broth and a calmer non-spicy version of the C4; a solid and simple dish for those who aren't so adventurous.  House Special Chow Mein (E1) General of them at any Chinese restaurant is to typically stay away from anything that is labeled \" house special\" ; once again this place breaks the mold. The house special chow mein is a great changeup from the broth based noodle dishes. It is here, you can feel and taste what truly fresh noodles are supposed to be like.   This is one of my favorite eats in the west side! At one point I think I was eating here at least once a week until the lady told me that we needed a break from the magic so now we hit it up about every other week.   For those that are Noobs to cuisine this place is very friendly and explaining the process and the dishes so fear not my Gwai Lo friends and followers... Eat with confidence.",

    "text": "Environment: An average-sized restaurant, with a hall that leads to restrooms in the back, and the kitchen off to the side with clear panels so that you can see the chefs preparing your food (especially the noodles).   Service: When you first enter, there is a sign-in sheet where you can indicate how many are in your party. However, both times a waiter had quickly greeted my friends and I to inquire himself how many people were in our party, and the wait times were not very long.  Food: I have tried the chicken with mushroom soup, as well as the beef brisket soup, spicy wontons, and house pancake appetizer. First, the house pancake, and spicy wonton appetizers. My boyfriend and I ordered the house pancakes with pork inside, and they were amazing. The filling was similar to that of pork dumplings/gyoza, but what really sold them for me was the outer bread encasing. It was light, crispy, and tasted like pastry dough. A must try! And although I do not mix well with spicy foods, the wontons were not overly spicy, just more on the chili-oil side. They were soft to eat, and the wonton wrapper actually reminded me of the noodles used for Pad Kee Mao.   For both soups, I ordered the original noodles. You can also order knife cut or flat-wide noodles. The original noodles had a good texture to them-- not too thin or too thick, and had a good amount of chewiness. There were a variety of mushrooms in the chicken with mushroom soup, which I really enjoyed. The chicken was not over-seasoned, but still very moist. For the beef brisket soup, the meat was very soft, but made the meal misleading as the brisket came in big chunks, so it seemed like there wasn't enough protein at first glance. However, the broth for both soups was very light, which allowed for the noodles, meats, and other garnishes in the soups to take the spotlight.   Overall: The prices were cheap, the food was really good, and I will definitely be back the next time I am in the Vegas area. Definitely would recommend to friends.",

I don't know if it's their \"magic\" noodles, or the amazingly tender beef, or rich soup broth, but I am a convert.   My mom also likes this place and coming from a Chinese woman who is more critical of restaurant Chinese food, that's saying something. And yes, she also gets the Beef noodle soup.   They have gained popularity since the first time I tried them, and now there is sometimes a wait.

    "text": "Like many culinary \"trends\" it took just one local success story to start the proliferation of hand-made Noodle houses in Las Vegas, The Noodle Man's 2015 debut on South Rainbow since giving the Valley Shang, Mian and The Magic Noodle on Fort Apache where five guests sat down to Dinner this past Saturday.  Located in the busy strip-mall across from Wal-Mart near Tropicana, a center also home to Sweet Addiction, Squeeze-In and ACE Donuts, it was just past 6:15pm that the small space was found packed full with persons mostly of Asian ancestry, many satisfied faces visible and conversation kept low as eyes focused on a team of five visible through glass spinning or cutting Noodles, pouring Broth or wok-firing Vegetables.  Pleasantly decorated and family friendly, a trio of servers featuring one man and two women seating guests from a list hung near the door, it is immediately as one party departs that tables are bussed with the next seated, a double-sided laminated menu proving easy to navigate and yielding one Appetizer plus four sizable plates or bowls that all arrived simultaneously just fifteen minutes later.    Dining mostly with novices to this style of Food, a Midwestern upbringing further gifting three with a low tolerance for heat, it was beginning with six segments of crispy Dough flecked by Green Onion that Dinner was underway, each greaseless bite richly flavored and nice for transitioning between various Noodles though the Pancakes are additionally offered with Eggs or Pork that other tables seemed to be enjoying like Tacos.  Moving next to the Restaurant's eponymous item, all four selections served with \"Original\" hand-pulled Noodles instead of flat or knife-cut versions as a result of guests not realizing the various choices were available until later, it was almost exactly one week after another disappointing Chicken-based Pho that The Magic Noodle's Chicken Soup fared much better, the umami-rich Broth studded with at least three types of Mushrooms leaving behind just a touch of grease on the lips and no two bites the same thanks to a plenty of Meat and Vegetables.  Continuing with Chicken as the protein of choice for Chow Mein, a lot of Bean Sprouts and Cabbage plus reduced Soy adding complexity to springy Starch, it was veering spicy that classic Dan Dan Noodles left lips temporarily numb, a surfeit of Ground Pork and Peanuts welcomed to counter Sichuan Peppers and Chili Oil while Beef Brisket Soup was rich with surprisingly tender Meat but a bit too much Cilantro and a peculiar lingering sweetness.  FOUR STARS:  Offering great value on the Dollar, four adults plus a child all sated for just $57 including tax and tip, it seems as though The Magic Noodle has found its stride less than one year after opening and with good Food plus service better than most of Spring Mountain Road additional visits to try more of the menu will surely follow.",

I opted to try the C4 which is the spicy beef noodles and it sure as hell didn't disappoint. I got it with the flat thick noodles but you can choose the original thinner noodles also. The beef pieces were in abundance and tender as hell. Drooling thinking about it. I like spicy food and it had a good kick to it for sure.  There was something wrong with their alarm system and it kept making loud ass noises the whole time but I enjoyed all the food regardless. Highly recommend trying the fresh noodles here!",

    "text": "Stopped by The Magic Noodle at the recommendation of a Bougie BFF.   This is as good as it gets...  Magic Noodle Service:  We came in with a party of 12 which included a baby and a 2 year old and our timing was good, we were seated immediately.  We sampled a lot of appetizers and ordered individual dishes as well.  Appetizers came out quickly and our main dishes came our shortly after.  Great work by the staff and kitchen.  Magic Noodle Cuisine:  My main dish was the C4/Szechuan Beef Brisket Noodle and it was very tasty.  The broth was spicy enough to make me sweat but didn't burn the mouth, love it.  The fresh noodles made in house is evident.  The Spicy Won Tons were so spicy and delish, we had to get another set in and I'm definitely ordering on the next visit.  The Onion Pancakes with the braised pork belly is another one I'm ordering again, full of flavor.  I sampled the House, Chicken and Mongolian Beef Chow Mein, all were good-tasting.  Magic Noodle Ambiance: The kitchen ahs glass windows which showcases the chefs tossing the lovely in house noodles.  The kitchen is surrounded by bar seating and the dining area is aligned with wooden tables and seats.  The wall is adorned with Chinese drawings and Hanzi in black and white to make for a very clean look.  Every noodle I sampled with our big party of 12 had the same characteristic, you can taste the freshness and it will bring you back.  The $ pricing for $$$ quality food will also bring you back.  The overall Szechuan cuisine at The Magic Noodle is very tasty and I enjoyed my first visit.  See you at the next one...enjoy! =)",

My favorite is the szechuan beef noodles. I recommend getting it with the knife cut noodles.  I only wish they put szechuan peppercorn in the soup!  Their dan dan mien is also pretty good if you like the mouth numbing peppercorn flavor.",

Personally, I wasn't a fan of the soup noodles, however, the Mongolian beef chow mein knocks the ball out of the park. The spicy wonton appetizer seems to lack taste/seasoning on the dumpling itself, but the sauce that it is placed in is a delight! The burrito is also splendid and is a favorite among my friends and I to share when we come here as a group. I personally can't recommend the Mongolian beef chow mein enough. Get extra noodles and you'll see why it's my favorite thing to order!",

I was told by a friend of mine who's a self proclaimed ramen connoisseur to give this place a try.   Like most ramen places that that I've visited here, the establishments are smaller and have limited table seating. There is a bar area for those like me that day eating solo. Walked in, noticed it was quite busy, it was lunch after all. Although I had already looked at their menu and of course, other yelp reviews, I had to look around to see what everyone had ordered.   I opted for the spicy brisket with Szechuan beef brisket with original hand pulled noodle and spicy won ton. I really liked the spicy won ton, the noodles had really good texture and I loved that there was cilantro in there, I just felt like the brisket and broth was not as flavorful as other fresh pulled noodle places I've tried.   Everyone has their own flavor palate, while others may like the flavor not the broth here, I felt like it was lacking. To each their own!",

They only had two servers working, and one was helping out with a to go order, so the service was a little slow, but I can't blame them the server was working hard and fast running around every where.  The restaurant itself is not very big though, clean and nice decor. There is also a see through mirror to the kitchen and you can watch the chef pulling noodles right in front of you! So if they pick their nose or spit in your food you would see it right away, and of course that wasn't happening here :)  I love the noodle soup I got (lan zhou beef noodle soup), soup was perfectly seasoned. The noodles were chewy and had great taste!  I also got the spicy wonton as an appetizer, and that was wayyyyy too much food. I was very hungry too before dinner, I still could not finish all the noodles and soup. The portion size is not bad at all. Even if you don't get appetizer you will walk away more than satiated.  Price is decent as well compared to other noodle places, around $8-10 a bowl. Other places charged up to $12-18..",

I came here with two friend for lunch and we ordered the chicken appetizer, and three noodles: Dan Dan noodles, the fish noodle soup and the sechuan beef noodle soup. All were super great. The chicken appetizer sauce had great flavor and the chicken was tender. My favorite of the noodles was the Dan dan, definitely get that. The other two were tasty, the beef was a touch salty and the fish was a little bland. The noodles were an amazing texture though! Awesome to see them pulling it in the back through the glass.  The is a small place so we did have to wait a little. I got a little annoyed because a table was done and it took them a long time to clean it before we were able to sit. After that though we had good service!   This place is super good and I highly recommend!!",

We also ordered the beef pancake I believe which had a side sauce I wasn't sure what the sauce was but reminded me of a bit of cinnamon, it was different but something about the tangy yet sweetness to it had me wanting more, beef chow Mein was yummy and a little spicy so the little one couldn't have any as well as the spicy dumplings which were even more spicy. Other than that they did forget about our order and for that they receive 4 stars but the lady did give the little one an apply juice on the house and that was nice of her, they were apologetic and very nice! The place is small but you can view them making the noodles and the food so fresh while you wait which keeps the time running quickly. Good little spot when you are in Vegas spending hundred on meals, I believe we paid about $30 which wasn't bad for all that we had! Can't wait to come back!",

My brother and I were greeted and seated upon arrival and the experience just depleted from there. The older lady that was our waitress seemed to be servicing the entire restaurant which I know can be stressful, so I didn't expect much. But she literally paid no attention to us AT ALL.. she walked by our table on several occasions with not even a \"how is your food?\" or \"do you need anything\". We asked for napkins and she threw them on the table. Our water glasses sat empty and unattended, while we watched her walk by our table and happily refill the glasses of the other guests. Luckily, one of the other younger girls working noticed we were being ignored and attended to us. I honestly feel that we were discriminated against racially, since we were 2 of the very few \"non Asian\" people dining.  Nonetheless, our experience was very disappointing and we will be getting take-out moving forward.",

Large window so you look in the kitchen and watch them make the noodles.  Pretty cool set up.  I ordered the beef brisket soup with flat noodles and the Szechwan spicy Potstickers to go.  When I got home I noticed they gave me the regular noodles instead of the flat ones.  Frustrating when you don't get what you order but oh well.  The broth was really rich, you could taste the real marrow that cooked out of the bones.  The brisket was ok not too tender and chewy.  Noodle were fresh and good. It was ok overall...  The Szechwan Potstickers were delicious, you could taste they hand make these and the Szechwan Sauce is really good. I'm giving them 4 stars based on just this sauce...  Worth a visit....",

The service started out really excellent but then they brought someone else's order out before we got ours.  OK noticed that the order came out in order.  Either was the waiter was good and we got some really good things.  The Wonton with added noodles was tasty but on the bland side.  Good for people in restricted diet.  The Mongolian fried noodles had a slight kick to it.  It didn't taste like Mongolian beef it lacked the green onions but it was still full of flavor.  Beef was tender and noodles aldenti. The garlic chicken was very garlicky for the others not so much for me.  It did have a kick at the end.   The onion cakes were crisp and thin.  It didn't get 5 stars for the price it was 5.99 and oil am use to paying less than 4.00 or even way less.  Beef brisket soup noodles was very tasty I wish it has some spicy to it.   The  Chicken chow mein was on the bland and but it was okay for seniors.  The pork belly with string beans was very favorable and the pork belly melted in your mouth.  Overall it was pretty good.",

Called in my order... I wanted the king pow chicken and chicken chow mein. Told the guy to pick me the most ordered or loved appetizer.. he suggested the spicy beef wonton.  Picked up my order, the restaurant was close to full... with happy faces. Bounced back home with my food opened up the wontons. WOWWWWWWWW. I don't eat this type of food very often.... I love these. Good thing my lady doesn't eat red meat or pork...is pork red meat? The spicy beef wontons blew me away. I ate them all in less than 3 minutes. Added the spicy oil stuff after the first one I ate. Straight firrrrre  Now, I move onto the kung pow... don't know how to compare it... cause I don't usually eat this. But it's GREAT. I add the hot oil to bot the Kung pow and chow mein....  All I have to say is try it. DEFINITELY GET THE SPICY BEEF WONTON!",

I ordered a Szechwan beef noodle soup, spicy pot stickers, and a appetizers that was like a pancake with pistol inside. All three were very good. The only thing I would have to change was the broth was very salty, now I don't mind that, but my doctor says too much salt is not good for the heart! One other thing is the pork inside pancake was a bit greasy. The flavor was awesome though.  So I rated 4 stars as the flavors were amazing. Some don't mind the salt and grease, and normally I do not either, however I have to listen to the doctor! I'll only go once a month. so please, if your near by the Magic Noodle, please do go in for some amazing tastes and flavors!",

When you walk in it looks really small and nothing to crazy and fancy but u get more of a \"mom n pop\" feel. The one thing that really stood out was the kitchen! It  wasn't all hidden in the back but it was right in the back left side with big windows around so you could see everything that is going on. How they cut the noodles, spin the noodles and just the whole process on how the noodles start and end up on your plate. The one thing that I didn't like was the fact that they bring out one bowl at a time if everyones food isn't reAdy. I might just be use to everyones food coming out at the same so that's just what I like but my friend got her plate first and I'm just sitting there waiting for mine all awkwardly until maybe a good 8 minutes later.  But overall Food and ambiance was great. Will definitely show this place to others.",

I tried the brisket noodle - no spice to go and wished I had checked my meal before I left or perhaps tried something different.   The beef was so fatty that I had to pick through most of it and only managed to eat about 4 pieces.  You can look at other's pictures of their bowls and see how fatty their meat is too so I know it wasn't just mine. It was also odd to me that you didn't pick out the broth and it just came with whatever but then again this is a Chinese place and not Japanese Ramen. The service was amazing and quick and the restaurant itself was clean and friendly.  I also liked the open/glass kitchen so we can watch the folks cooking. I probably won't be back because for a place that calls themselves 'Magic Noodle' I didn't actually like the noodles.",

Was nice to see our noodles being pulled right in front of us! Flavors are spot on and staff is great and kept checking on us. There are many noodle places in Vegas but this one makes their own noodles fresh... shouldn't taken a video but didn't want to mess with the guys rhythm. Go check them out! Great prices as well.

So I have bookmarked this place since forever whenever my favorite LV foodie comes here with his yummy posts. The noodles had me at hello and I just hadddddd to come whenever I could.  Arriving there was a wait. It didn't take too long for us to be seated but that could be because it was just my husband and I. If my kids were here... probably a longer wait.  Sitting down everything on the menu sounds delicious. My husband and I had only planner to get an entree each just so we can venture and eat more elsewhere. But glad our eyes were bigger then our stomachs. I ended up ordered two appetizers with our entrees and it was worth not saving any room for anything else LOL  Szechuan Beef Brisket Noodle: OMG that brisket though just melts in your mouth. Every bite was like a bite of happiness taking us back to the good eats in China. It wasn't too spicy for us but I can't say it won't be for someone else since the spice levels for everyone is different.   Chong Qing Style Spicy Noodles: My bowl was packed with flavor. Again the spiciness is different for everyone and for me it was not spicy. But I did love how soft and chewy the noodles were and the broth just had me already. The ground pork was good too but I kind of regretted not getting the brisket since I loved how the beef just melts in your mouth.  House Special Pancakes: These were more like rolled dumplings. Again everything we had here was super packed with flavor. Every bite was a bite in heaven lol. The outside was crispy and the inside was juicy. It says its 3 pieces but they cut it in half and it still looks like a lot.  Spicy Dumplings Szechuan Style: These were probably the spiciest on our table. Each bite again was packed with flavor but get ready to have your mouths numb from the spiciness. Super delicious and still not too hot where we couldn't stand it.   My husband and I love the food here so much.. this is going to be our go to spot when in Vegas. Pleaseeeeeee open up a restaurant in Orange County soon!!! I super wish we had this closer to home!!!! Really good place to have authentic REAL chinese food with freshly made noodles. A must when in Vegas!!!!  Yelp Review 2018 Challenge 80/100",

    "text": "I love the Magic Noodle! It is everything I look for in a restaurant - it scores in cleanliness, food quality, and customer service. I came on Christmas Day, and the place was packed. Luckily enough, there was one table open. There were a lot of take-out orders as well, which is a sign of a tried and True popular restaurant.  For appetizers, we ordered the spicy wontons, steamed chicken, and beef. They were all delicious, and one of the best spicy wontons I've had - and trust me, I've had a lot of spicy wontons from all types of establishments! Theirs was garlicky, a welcome change. I also loved B1 and B2, which I consider staples when ordering. B2 packs a lot of flavor, and was not too spicy or oily as its appearance may have you believe.  We got C1 for the main, which can be shared with another if you load up on appetizers. The noodles were perfect... the brisket in the soup noodle was immaculate. It's the same type of meat used in B1. Honestly, I have nothing to complain about. The green onion pancakes were also fresh and crispy, and not oily.  Lastly, the service was splendid and the waitstaff have some amazing communication skills! Our main waiter even told us that we ordered too much, and I appreciated his genuineness. All in all, I recommend and would definitely come back, and it's at the top of my list for take-out.",

They're handmade and take a little longer to come out than the thin noodles, but so worth it and we didn't even have to wait that long. The broth was very rich and oil/spice heavy (perfect hangover cure ). We also got the wontons and dumplings and they were so soft and flavorful! I came here last week and I'm still craving it!!!",

I have been dying to try this place since it flooded instagram with the most gorgeous noodle lifts that I have ever seen. They also have a window to see them tossing & pulling your noodles. It's quite mesmermizing how one can take a piece of dough, pull, fold and bounce to create strands of noodles. Watching the noodles made in front of me got me salivating for my noodles.  Both hubby and I ordered the spicy beef stew noodles and it was freakin spicy. We can both handle spicy but this was too much. The broth was delicious and flavorful but a bit oily. It could be that we arrived when it first opened so we're getting soup from the top of the pot, where all the oil is. As for the noodles, they were silky, slightly firm, and a little bit chewy. I would definitely be back if I'm ever in Vegas again.   Tip: Go early for lunch. We got there 10 minutes after opening and half the restaurant was full.",

My family and I will always order the house special chow mein which comes with shrimp, veggies, beef, and chicken. We also order the house special pancake which you can choose whether you want beef, pork, or chicken in it. What disappointed me the most was that when this restaurant first opened, consistency was always there and it quickly became one of my favorite places. A few days ago I ordered take-out and in my house special chow mein, all I received was ONE shrimp, ONE beef, and TWO pieces of chicken. There was more veggies than the noodle itself which made me quite disappointed. If this place had kept its consistency it would easily be 4 stars and possibly even a 5, but with all the recent inconsistencies ranging from burnt appetizers to cutting corners on dishes, unless this place gets its act back together, my family and I have no reason to give them our business. Fortunately the house special pancake came out decent this time.   Pros:  +Nice staff +Clean interior   Cons: -inconsistent food quality",

You can watch the noodle pull from behind a glass wall which is always fun for kids to watch. The restaurant itself is modern but in a small space. Depending on the time of day, there can be a bit of a wait.  The noodles here are definately delicious since they are freshly made. They make both a traditional noodle and a wide width noodle but I prefer the wide width noodle. The wide width noodles hold the sauce better especially if it is a fried dish. If you are looking for a dish with seafood, I recommend the shrimp fried noodles with wide noodles. I have yet to try the soup noodles but it did look delicious.   Magic Noodle is definitely a noodle house worth trying! Bon Appetit!",

But the appetizers! The appetizers are the star of this restaurant! The appetizers are to die for! They're really good! Sometimes we go and just order the appetizers. Sometimes we just get the same thing over and over again. We especially love the onion pancake with the braised pork. We get it every time and we love it every time. The pancake was so crispy and the pork compliment it so well. I've just never tasted anything like it. They should just call the restaurant: The Magic Onion Pancake with Braised Pork and I would eat at least once a week just to get that.   Service was good. Nothing extraordinary. Nonetheless, our servers always check in on us and made sure our waters never empty out. So I do recommend this place.",

Had the spicy wontons for apps and the flavor wasn't just of spicy oil but it had some rich deep notes. The spice was just perfect, not volcano spice but made you sweat a bit.  We tried out two different noodle soups. And they were both delicious!! Rich in flavor with that Szechuan numbness you come to expect from a good Szechuan dish. The spice was right on again. Meat was super tender and juicy. The noodles made fresh where also perfection.  Portions were a good amount and we were able to take some home for a small bite later.   Staff was courteous and attentive and place was busy.  They have an open style kitchen where you can see them hand stretching the noodles.   We will def be back for more!",

We tend to focus more on eateries in Chinatown and/or Southwest. But anyway, a friend of mine posted pics and I was reminded of how much I wanted to check this place out so of course the husband said we were going after the kid's wrestling match.   Although this is a noodle joint, I highly recommend you start off with their Sweet and sour black fungus salad and spicy wonton - both delicious! Honestly, I enjoyed the black fungus more than the noodles. The flavor and texture was perfect.  The spicy wonton wasn't too spicy, which made it enjoyable.  With that said, I decided to go with the spicy brisket soup. And although the texture of the noodles and beef were perfect, the broth was too spicy for my liking that it was actually hard to enjoy.   Would I come back though?!?  Yea I would. But next time I will definitely go for the non spicy or ask them to lower the spice level on my noodles.",

    "text": "While visiting Las Vegas, I usually eat at my usual favorites located on the Strip or Fremont St.  But after reading the review of Lori N., The Magic Noodle was on my list to check out.  After arriving in Vegas, we met our Vegas friend for dinner at 8pm.  Located in a mini mall, parking was easy!  Win! Expecting a wait, the restaurant was half full and we were immediately seated.  Win!    The casual restaurant has three booths, several tables for two and fours and a five seat counter.  The kitchen is open and you can see the chef making the hand pulled noodles. Yes, the noodles here are hand pulled, which I love for its unique taste and texture.   After checking out the menu of appetizers, soup, sauce and stir-fried noodles and fried rice, we started with: Green Onion Pancakes - cut into six wedges, they were light, crispy and not greasy.  One of the best I've had.  Spicy Wonton - Six wontons to the order.  Love the thin skins of the wontons. Delicious.  The spicy oil was medium in heat and was a little spicy for one in our group.  We then ordered: Sichuan Sweet & Sour Noodles in original noodles.  Concerned with the spiciness, our waitress said we could order it mild. You toss the Sweet & Sour Noodles with the peanut, green onion, cucumber, sesame and garlic sauce on the bottom of the bowl.  This was good, but was a little spicier than mild.    Shredded Chicken with Garlic Sauce with knife-cut noodles. The shredded chicken and noodles were coated in a garlic sauce with bell peppers and onions.  We loved the chewy texture of the thick knife cut noodles with the garlicky mild sauce.  Decided to finish it off by ordering Beef Brisket Noodles in original noodles, as recommended by the waitress.  The bowl had Chinese greens, green onions and cilantro in a beef broth. But the star was the beef brisket. Wow, it was so tender and flavorful.  One of the best Chinese briskets that I've tried.    It was a great first meal in Vegas. So good that our Vegas friend is coming back.  Delicious hand pulled noodles with friendly/helpful service and water glasses that were always filled, which you'll need with the spiciness of the food in a nice, clean casual atmosphere with reasonable prices.  Win!  Hey, that makes three wins at one stop!  Winner!",

So first let's start with the House Special Pancakes. It had a crispy wrapper that enclosed deliciously seasoned and perfectly salty ground beef. It was accompanied by a slightly sweeter version of soy sauce, enhancing the flavors of the beef.   I had the Beef Brisket with the wide noodles and it was AMAZING! The broth was flavorful with the perfect balance of saltiness and richness of the beef. You can also tell that the noodles are freshly made and cooked, as they have a nice bite to them. The cilantro gave the soup a slight fresh and citrus flavor. The beef that accompanied the soup was also very tender and just fell apart in your mouth.  The Mongolian Beef with wide noodles were also delicious! The noodles were also made and prepared fresh, and the sauce was spicy, giving it a good kick to the dish.   Do yourself a favor and try out Magic Noodle! It is an amazing local spot for anyone who loves Chinese style noodles.",

My current favorites: Appetizers: Onion pancakes (add the egg) and their spicy dumplings Szechuan style. I am in LOVE with thei Szechuan style dumplings. if you can only get one appetizer, I highly suggest this one. You can tell they are home made and their sauce is just amazing.   Soup Noodles: My favorite is Szechuan Beef Brisket Noodle. I love the spice to it and their beef brisket is delicious. The broth used for this soup noodle is really flavorful. They absolutely nailed it. For more spice, I like to add some of the szechuan dumpling sauce to it for just a little more kick. But this is the soup noodle I recommend the most if you love a bit of spice.  Sauce Noodle: I love their Dan Dan noodles. Decent amount of noodles, minced meat and onion. Love it when I'm looking for lighter sauce.  Stir Fried Noodles: My favorite is their Mongolian Beef Chow Mein. Beef, bell peppers, onion, what could be better? This is one of my favorite dishes I keep coming back to. Another great one is the Braised Pork Belly with String Beans. Pork belly is just absolutely delicious.   Atmosphere: This place definitely fills up during the busy lunch and dinner times. It is definitely worth the wait since their food is just amazing. This is definitely a place I frequent often and will continue to do so. I highly recommend it.",

I'll be bringing my parents next time they visit, as they enjoy hand pulled/cut noodles.  I do have to add that I was originally unhappy that we were seated for 15 minutes without water or service (hence minus one-star)... but once I walked up to the staff and let them know they apologized & went out of their way to treat us very nicely, brought our food quickly, and gave us a free cucumber salad appetizer.",

The kitchen staff are talented and smile thankfully at the gawking eyes. It must be interesting to have some watch so carefully at something you do Day in and day out. But just watching the noodles get pulled, and being so close to the kitchen as the 'Magic' happens is a treat for me!",

We ordered LanZhou Hand Pulled Noodle, Spicy Beef Brisket Noodle, and Beef Roll.  The noodles are outstanding! And the roll is best in town! I would visit here everyday if they are next to my house lol",

I ordered the House Special  Chow Mein with no ONIONS. As I started to eat it, it was very fresh and noodles were amazing I bit into an onion and immediately Eric came over and I was kind of embarrassed to to eat the meal he went ahead and changed it and I ended up having a Beef Brisket Soup. Well.... it was AMAZING! The noodles were incredible that I think I'm going back my next day off to eat the same thing again. All I can say is the food is very fresh and the service is 5 stars!",

We ordered the cold appetizer: steamed chicken in chili oil, spicy wontons and both my partner and I ordered Szechuan beef brisket noodle soup. Everything was brilliant!!! Each dish had layers of spice and flavor that varied in different ways. It was my Boyfriends first time eating Szechuan/sichuan and was the perfect way to start. He kept saying \"My tongue is tingling.\" lol  By far my favorite dish was the Steamed chicken in Chili oil. I swear I have dreams about it now, or when the next time I can get it. Only down side is that I live in LA :( Its 4 hours away! Please open a location in LA!!!",

As soon as you enter you are greeted and quickly shown to your table. From the table you are able to peer into the kitchen and see how the noodles are made.   The food was amazing. We started with the scallion pancakes & Braised Pork Belly. Pancakes were brought out quickly and the pork belly were cooked to perfection. Following the appetizers was my Szechuan Beef Brisket Noodle. The only thing that did not meet my expectations were the spice levels (nothing that the complimentary chilli oil couldn't fix)  Overall I loved everything in my meal and will definitely be back to try the rest of the menu",

So we weren't super hungry when we went and a friend wanted to try it so we didn't try any appetizers, but the soup we got was good nonetheless. I love how you can see them making the noodles fresh from the kitchen. It's so cool. One of the guys winked at my friend LOL...he's probably used to get filmed and watched all the time. As for the food, we could have been more diverse in our selection, but we got the beef brisket noodle and Szechuan beef brisket noodle. Both were good but of course the Szechuan beef noodle had a little more of a flavor kick to it. The broth was savory, the beef was tender and the price of everything is soooo cheap/reasonable for what the portion you get. The service is great, however the place is a little small so the wait could vary. We luckily got there before a huge family came in. They seem to be a popular place so I hope they expand. I can't wait to try more items here!",

I guess I was given the unlucky table by the entrance, but it's awkward and annoying when a crowd of people are basically standing all over you and bumping elbows every time you move your arms to use chopsticks or your spoon.    All of the Szechuan offerings were overpowered by whatever oil was added to the soup, and there was no nuance or depth flavor-wise, unlike pho or ramen.  I also initially ordered the wide noodles for my soup, but the server said to go with the original noodles as the wide ones were only good for IG photos.  Huh??    The apps came out after the soups and only after I reminded the servers that we were still waiting for them.  Food and the bill took forever - the restaurant needs to hire more staff during the evenings as other tables were waiting a long time for their meals, there was occasional confusion as to which waiting party was to sit down first, and the carry-out crowd was non-stop and basically took precedence over the patrons seated inside.  We were never checked on once during our meal or offered drinks, refills, etc.  This would all have been tolerable if the food was fantastic, but it was not.    The chow mein was the only redeeming feature of this experience, but even that is not enough to justify a return visit.  And definitely don't sit at the center table by the door, unless you don't mind 10-20 people glaring at you as you eat as they try to subliminally spur you on to finish your meal already.",

    "text": "Came here for the first time on a recent Friday, to pick up some lunch for myself and my friend while she was at work.   Magic Noodle is located in the same plaza as Infused Tea Lounge, Makai, etc, just south of Tropicana on Fort Apache. I had arrived less than 30 minutes after they opened but almost the entire restaurant was full already. Every table was occupied, if not mildly over occupied. The layout of the restaurant is fairly similar to that of Shang's Artisan or Noodle man, with an open kitchen blocked off by a large glass wall showing the noodle being pulled.   I had ordered a dan dan noodle for myself, shredded chicken noodle w/ garlic sauce for her, and a beef brisket noodle for another friend at the office. It took maybe 15-20 minutes to get my order but it was still fairly quick, considering how busy the restaurant was.   The food smelled really good in the car as I was being mildly tortured while driving over to the office my friend is at.   They separate all the sauces and soups since it was ordered as take out. For some reason, the dan dan noodle sauce got all over the place, leaving like less than an inch of sauce left in that huge take out bowl. Fortunately, that was still enough to cover all the noodles, if anything, it was still a bit salty. Sauce had a good amount of numbing spice/oil to it which was pretty decent  The noodles, even after sitting in a take out box for give or take 30 minutes, were still quite al dente and had a good amount of bite to it, which was great. I noticed their strands of noodles are not too uniform throughout. Thickness varied quite a lot in the same order.   Great to have a hand pulled noodle place so close to home. Beats driving to Noodle Man or Shang's Artisan when feeling a bit lazy. Parking is much easier here than Shang's !",

It looks really spicy like it would burn your whole face off but it was mild and just right. I hate it when restaurants use face numbing chili oil. I cant taste anything. But it was perfect here. Couple times i looked up and around the restaurant and kitchen, i saw the cooks staring at me with an angry demeanor. Like an bitter old neighbor whos watching you play in your yard to make sure you dont step over on to their grass and the moment you do they unleash hell. But our waitress was really cute so i stopped looking at the cooks and just focused on her (in a non-creepy way)",

The fact that you can see them make the noodles from scratch is also a kick.  I was there for dinner once and then again for lunch both times the experience was the same. Perfect.  The staff is friendly even when they're busy.  I was checked on frequently and my water glass was never empty.  Important when you like it spicy!  Great place and atmosphere. I see them expanding soon!",

    "text": "The food is good, but lack of service and attention is ridiculous. We have tried this place twice and both experiences were bad.   First experience we ordered from here on Postmates. We were really excited to try this place because of all the good reviews. Order finally gets to our house and they didnt give us the noodles to our soup and instead of noodles we received rice. We aren't ones to complain and everyone has an off night. No big deal, so we ate the rice and had the broth.   Like mentioned earlier we thought the food was good, so we decided to try the dine in experience in hopes for better luck. We went for a late lunch. We ordered two soups and a fried rice. The rice comes out pretty quick, but they didn't give us plates to make it easier to eat it. About 10 min go by before someone pays attention to us long enough for us to ask for plates. Another 20 minutes later my husband gets his noodle soup. Enough times goes by that he has now finished his soup and me trying to get someone to pay attention to us so I ask where my soup was. They said oh sorry 3 minutes. Which at that point it really only took 3 minutes for them to get me my soup. Which makes me wonder why did it take so long in the first place. We saw many tables come and go in the time we sat there waiting for food. For what we thought would be a pretty quick meal we were there for over an hour and I ended up just getting my soup to go because my husband had to go back to work.   The food was good, but not good enough to deal with the horrible service and lack of attention. Much rather go down the street to Mr. Chopsticks for the same food and better service.",

The place is so good and so nice and this angry looking fresh off the boat guy looks angry while he's cooking as well  and obv is very dirty to act like that while cooking just horrible ! should be Instant loss of job fire that guy ! He's horrible and ruins such a great place with amazing food... the food is deff 5 stars but the gross wok chef needs to be fired he brought the review to 3 stars for being so gross he's a health hazard also he was talking with food in his mouth he really needs to get a job at Walmart where he belongs instead of such a nice restaurant... the manager said he will be replacing our order hopefully that guy is gone next time where there",

For the main course I ordered Mongolian beef Chow main and my husband ordered the brisket noodle soup. None of them had a delicious flavor. Mine was too sweet and no garlic!

The staff was very hospitable . They checked on us our entire stay and engaged with some jokes here and there. The service and food is on point.

The good part is how clear it is, no cloudiness which means it was cooked repeatedly.  Service: I like the service here. They acknowledge you once you walk in. I usually go off hours so I never catch the rush hours, which works to my benefit. The servers are always coming around to check for empty dishes and to refill our drinks.  Environment: We enjoy looking into the kitchen area, where we see the noodles being made. The sitting area is nice and clean. That tables are not sticky like most Asian restaurants.",

    "text": "The food was 4 stars.  Why 3 rating?    1) I ordered an appetizer and a main - the main came out 4 minutes after I ordered and the appetizer arrived when I was 1/2 way through my main. I had a feeling I should have ordered the app and just waited.  But I thought I would give the service a try on timing.   2) If you are going to run an open kitchen and seat people along the counter area by the glass to watch -  be ready for all eyes on you.  You are the show.  You are the star.   2a) If you're going have an open kitchen with glass - the glass should be clean.  It was not.  I'm not talking about a little flour from the hand made / tossed noodles being on the glass...I'm talking the glass was hazy and needed attention. 3) The containers on the tables that hold - Chili Oil, Soy Sauce, and Black Vinegar were dirty.  The spoons looked like they've not been changed in a long time and the dried crusty residue around the top of the lids was nasty.  May take a bit of effort but when a customer is finished dining the  spoons should be changed and the lids should be wiped down.  Perhaps keeping the condiments \"to serve\" would be a better remedy instead of leaving them out on every table.   4) One employee came into the open kitchen. He wasn't wearing gloves.  He reached into his pocket, pulled out his wallet, went inside and brought out a sum of cash.  He began to count and fan it.   He put it back in the wallet and walked behind the rear curtain (you could still see his legs)  4a) Another employee came from behind the curtain and when he did you could see the employee from (4) peeling fresh leafy vegetables with his bare hands.   He never washed his hands from handling dirty money.  5) When I informed my server of the situation he said he wasn't a manager but would tell them.  He went in the back for a minute or two and came back out to me and said \"thank you' 6) The employee that needed to wash his hands was still standing doing his work.   I then said to the server - HE NEEDS TO WASH HIS HANDS NOW.  He went back and had the person washed his hands.    They are still a new place.  The food was indeed delicious.  Am I a bit worried about eating my full meal and watching the sanitary habits of the employees?  Yeah....just a bit.  If you have an open restaurant like this you need to be on TOP of sanitation and all employees need to be handling food properly.  I will try it again.  I hope what I noticed the first time doesn't happen again or to anyone else.",

It doesn't seat very many, maybe 25-30 people max? Clean and barely smelled of food until the people next to us got their order. I got the Vegetable Chou Mein and he got the Szechwan Beef Brisket. These are good portions, might even need a take home box. I would wish for hot tea as an option vs just cold drinks, as hot soup and cold drinks don't really go well for digestion. And perhaps a non-spicy egg/spring roll to enjoy since not everyone eats spicy? It seems they do a lot of to-go business too since there's not a lot of seating. We ate well for under $20 w just water to drink.",

From the moment we sat down at the bar facing the kitchen all I could focus on was the \"B\" health grade on the wall. The kitchen from what I could see wasn't the cleanest, but despite my nervousness we stayed. Being Vegan, I ordered the vegetable chow mein. Once I received my food I soon realized that the plastic chopsticks make it difficult to eat noodles with because the noodles slide on the chopstick. The waiter didn't check on us at all throughout the interaction and the food was just okay. Tbh I enjoy the chow mein at Panda Express more. Not worth the hype, and the mediocre service.",

When we sat down, nobody took our order, we had to actually wait 20 minutes for someone to come to our table and take our orders. Also, it took them the longest time to give our orders to us. I was looking around and the people who ordered after us received theirs first before us, so we just let it go. My spicy beef noodles came, then waited 15 minutes for the next noodles to come, and waited more minutes for our APPETIZERS to be served. The servers were rude when asked a question, trying to flag them because we needed a drink and a napkin but just disregarded our table and by the time that we were about to pay they started to be nice to our table. That's what annoyed me the most. Moreover, I asked for them to wrap our leftovers to go and when we got home, THEY GAVE US THE WRONG FOOD. I DO NOT KNOW WHOSE IT WAS BUT WE DID NOT ORDER ANY OF THOSE FOOD ON THE LEFTOVER BAG THEY GAVE US. IT LOOKED DISGUSTING WHEN I OPENED IT. I have no clue whatsoever what their deal was but this place has just SHITTY service at all. Your food is fine but the SERVICE IS HORRIBLE. Might want to ask your servers to be a little nicer sometimes.",

I ordered the Lang zhou noodle, the noodles were pretty good, a little on the salty side but good flavor. I started with the veggie pancake, that I enjoyed, that was probably the best part of dinner. I ordered a hot tea and was very disappointing, it's supposed to be hot!  It was barely warm, not enjoyable at all. The service was also not very good, not very friendly, a bit slow and not welcoming at all. The chicken in the chicken chow mein my father ordered were tiny slivers of chicken and were chewy, I don't recommended. It's a small restaurant, which is fine, no alcohol available.  It would also be nice if the menu had a description of what the noodle dishes contained. I had to google the names to figure out what was in them.",

He thought the name was amusing and asked if we could try it.   We walked in and were greeted by a smiling face.  He sat us immediately and got some drinks right out to our table.  I cannot even describe how delicious the place smelled.  I had no clue what dish was creating it, but I was hoping that whatever I chose would be it.  While we decided, my son was entrances watching one of the chefs making the noodles that they use in their dishes.   The staff remained attentive through the whole meal even as the restaurant filled.  Every dish we ordered was absolutely scrumptious.   I cannot use the word AMAZING enough for The Magic Noodle. The atmosphere is AMAZING.   The staff is AMAZING.  The food is ABSOLUTELY AMAZING.  And the price is definitely AMAZING for all that they offer.   This is definitely a must visit again and again.

Decor at this place looks very nice. There are about 8 tables and can probably hold about 30 customers. All the furniture is made of wood and they have a nice piece of art on their wall. I got the Spicy Beef Noodle Soup with knife cut noodles and Beef Pancake. The beef pancake was pretty good but surprisingly greasy, the bad greasy as in when you bite into it, grease shoots out. The soup broth was a great temperature coming out. I liked the soup and usually enjoy spicy, but I felt the spice hid the flavor of the broth. The knife cut noodles were delicious. Best way I can describe it is that there is a lot of substance and texture and does not taste starchy. The noodles are very fresh. I enjoyed the meal the more I ate it. My biggest complaint is that I came to the restaurant with a group of 3 but they brought all of our meals at different times, like between 5-10 minutes apart. I would of liked if we could of all enjoyed our meals together. I heard from friends that they also had the same complaint. Overall, this place is close to my work so I will be back, but I would not go out of my way to try it again.",

The inside of the restaurant is fairly small and they can't really sit many people at the same time. That is why I think it is important to go early in order to be seated promptly. I went with a large group of people at 6:00pm and had no issues getting a table. By the time we left though there were at least 15 people waiting to be seated.   The food here is REALLY good. I ordered the beef brisket soup with wide noodles. The noodles were awesome and the soup was very flavorful. I was impressed with the amount of meat they put on the soup as well. They do not shy away from that!   I also ordered the pork garlic appetizer and I honestly think this was one of the best things! I had never had something like that before and it is on my list to order it again!  Prompt and great service received. Thank you!",

I loved my knife cut noodles! I don't think I'd deviate from those either. -Mongolian beef noodle had a spicy flavor, rich with sauce. It has a kick and can leave your lips kinda numb but the flavor was worth it, and I don't do spicy.  -Chicken fried rice? Yassssss!  We were really taken back by how chill they were with us. We had my 3 year old niece with us and they even joked around with her. It made my heart happy! They goofed around with us and told some jokes about green onions. LOL. It was great!  Fresh, hand cut noodles are WHATS UP!!!",

Really enjoyed the spicy wonton. Looks simple but the sauce made it pretty amazing. I also recommend the pancake roll, everyone enjoyed that too. I had the spicy brisket noodle soup...totally get the knife cut noodles (wide noodles). Very smooth and slightly al dente and paired perfectly with the broth which was abundant with flavor. Everyone at our table enjoyed what they had ordered.   Nice and clean and was fun to watch the noodles being made behind the glass.",

Green Onion Pancakes with pork belly - compared to the soup noodle, this one was the winner.   2. Chong Qing Style Spicy Noodle - I liked the pickled vegetable (green beans) in this soup, but it was lacking in flavor.  I also wish they had included on the menu that this has crushed peanuts.  I prefer the spicy noodle at La Mian way more.   3. Spicy Pork Ribs Noodle - this one tasted better than Chong Qing, but still bleh.  Service was great!  Our kind waiter even gave my toddler apple juice when she asked for it.  But..I don't know if I will return because I do like La Mian better.",

    "text": "\"Vegas cold-weather season\" hit suddenly so the family and I tried this new local shop to warm up. So excited to have a noodle shop similar to Shang but closer to home!  We tried the beef brisket with knife cut noodle and the fish with pickled vegetable and knife cut noodles.  Beef brisket: broth is ginger flavor forward, slightly floral and sweet. Overall good, but could have more depth of that beefy flavor. The knife cut noodles were fabulous, perfectly not-too-thin-not-too-thick. Meat was tasty, as well. Very filling on this cold night.  Fish & Pickled Veg Noodle: This one packs a good spicy kick. Loved, loved the spice level! Especially with the pickled vegetables cutting through the spiced broth. It's only missing some fresh thinly sliced cabbage or other fresh vegetable to add some texture. I noticed with the noodles, some were very thick and others more similar to the size of the noodles in the beef brisket bowl so their cook was inconsistent. Fish was tasty with all the broth flavor, but a little muddy on the finish.  The shop is small and steadily busy, yet tables were rotating at a good pace with no one left waiting too long to find their spot. Service was also good. For beverages, the hot spicy soup would be great washed down with a nice beer, so hopefully they'll add beer and wine to the menu eventually (soft drinks/teas/juices currently.)  Overall, solid dishes - more like 3.5 stars- and will be returning to try more.",

Usually I do, but I still have not a clue was Dan Dan noodles are.  And tap water had a normal great taste to it.  They might want to make sure that water filter is working.  Oh well,,,  Ended up with the Mongolian beef item.  It was really super tasty.  Noodles were obviously fresh and flavors were great.  Veggies cooked nicely.  Came with peppers, onion and carrot I believe.  Portion is solid.  Cost $8.95.   Not too shabby.  Wife got Szechwan Beef Brisket.  I didn't like it but she did.      Would I go back, yes.  Fresh food, reasonable prices and nice flavor.    I like the window looking into the kitchen and the guy swinging the noodles around all fancy like.",

    "text": "A pretty good Chinese noodle place with a couple minor flaws.  We came in at peak dinner time on a Sunday and the place was pretty packed but nobody was on the wait list. They were able to seat us reasonably quick which was nice - but unfortunately the table was pretty sticky and dirty. Unfortunately the water cups were also very dirty (it had like pieces of noodles stuck inside) and had a weird odor to it. The waitress didn't come by to check on us during the meal or refill our waters but I guess this is to be expected from a quicky Chinese food place. A little disappointing considering there were at least 3 servers running this smaller sized restaurant that could be easily covered by 1 person.  Anyways - on to the goods:  Appetizer - B2 - Steamed Chicken w/Chili Sauce (aka \"mouthwatering chicken\") - excellent - it is a cold chicken dish soaked in awesome chili sauce.  They were very thoughtful in picking the bones out in preparing this dish which I really appreciate! This is usually a really bony dish that's hard to navigate at most places so that was a good surprise. It's pretty oily (supposed to be) but spiced/seasoned with just the right amount of heat.  B3 - Sliced Pork with Garlic Sauce - another cold dish, with some chili oil also - but more on the sweeter side.  The garlic flavor / amount of garlic was kind of weak considering how this dish is supposed to be done but otherwise it was ok. (I actually found myself dipping it into the B2 sauce for more flavor)  Noodle - C7 - Chong Qing Style Spicy Noodle - I got it with the wide noodles (which do take a little bit longer to prepare as advised by the waitress) and it was excellent.  Just the right amount of heat with the slightly crunchy peanuts combined with the ground pork made for a wonderful combination.  Quality of the noodles was excellent and portion size was good value.  I'd order it again.  If I were in the area I'd come back but maybe at a little less busy time in hopes of cleaner tables/cups and better service.",

Unfortunately the original place we went to had about a 90 min wait, so we decided to try The Magic Noodle. We only had to wait about 10 min. Our group was seated at the bar, so we were able to watch them make the noodles along with all the dishes coming out of the kitchen.   I decided on the chicken and mushroom soup with knife cut noodles. The waitress recommended I get the original noodles for the soup, but I was craving thick noodles so I went against her suggestion.   We also ordered cucumbers as an appetizer and the wontons. The cucumbers were delicious! Unfortunately, we were brought the dumplings instead of the wontons, and since it came after we got our soups, we weren't going to complain and send it back. The dumplings were more on the sweet side, different than what we were expecting but still good.   One friend ordered the fish soup and due to the pickled mustard greens, it was incredibly sour and vinegary. So beware! Another friend ordered the spicy Szechuan beef noodle soup and the broth wasn't too bad, though a tad on the salty side.   Service was on the slow side.   Prices are great though for the portions!",

I ordered the hand pulled noodles and my boyfriend had the knife shaved, so we were able to see those made and food comes out very fast. These are some of the freshest noodles I have had and the broth is delicious.   The spicy wonton appetizer is a must-have!",

We were recommended to come for lunch since it's pretty cheap but there normally is a long line out the door and the restaurant is small so we called for take out. It took 25 minutes. We ordered: beef brisket noodle soup with flat noodles, house special chow mein with original noodles, beef pancake, spicy wonton and pork belly fried rice. My fave was the beef pancake and the fried rice. The noodle soup was the worst. I wouldn't order that again. Unfortunately, I still don't believe in magic.",

Everyone enjoyed their dishes so much we ordered food for the next day (E1 House Special Chow Mien flat noodle, Dan Dan thin noodle and more spicy wontons!) definitely drop by if you have the chance and watch the chef's hand pull the noodles, and indulge!!",

Hot, inferno spicy Szechuan beef noodle and a side of tripe in chili oil\" Asian poker bud to nods of agreement.  \"Oh come on!  Last time we had spicy Asian, it burned down there for hours!\"  It's worth it.  IMPORTANT:  Those unfamiliar with Szechuan cuisine, lots of oil and chili infused oil used.  Can't handle the internal lubrication... you've been warned.  Known for their excellent hand pulled and knife cut noodles served a multitude of ways, don't pass on their spicy, but tasty starters.  The house special pancake, very good.  The same batter for the traditional green onion pancake, pan fried and rolled around seasoned, stir fried shredded pork, beef or chopped veg.  Crisp on the outside, very flavorful juiciness on the inside.   The chilled steamed chicken swimming in a chili oil sauce, delicious simplicity.  Spicy and very oily but you can clearly taste the natural sweetness of the chicken.  The chilled, viscous oil adds to the silky mouth finish.  The beef tripe in the same sauce, equally good.  Noodles are excellent.  Regardless the type, generous portions of thick, very glutinous and toothsome noodles with lots of natural imperfections for the broth or sauce to cling to.    The spicy broths (beef brisket noodles and pork based \"chong qing\" noodles) loaded with beef stock, fermented notes and lots of fiery but clean chili taste.  A mild Zhajiang noodle with diced pork, julienned carrots and zucchini and fermented soy bean sauce, simple but very flavorful.  The noodle is the star.  Asian service and not exactly cleanest restaurant (sticky table).  All good, this isn't a fancy place.  Another great option for authentic Asian dining.",

On a recent trip to Las Vegas, I was super excited to take my family to The Magic Noodle - a very popular noodle restaurant known for their handmade noodles that you can choose to be either hand pulled or knife cut.  Luckily for my inner germaphobe, they hand pull the noodles behind an enclosed kitchen with glass walls.  The causal eatery was a hit with my family.  We started with the onion pancakes and sweet and sour black fungus salad.  I loved the onion pancakes and while I balked at the fungus, I tried it and it was really good!  It reminded my of seaweed and my parents assured me it is really good for you.  For the noodles, we ordered the beef brisket noodle, dan dan noodle, lan zhou noodle, and the chong qing style spicy noodle.  We enjoyed all the noodle dishes except for the dan dan noodle, which my sister was a little disappointed by the lack of flavor.  In their defense, I think she just likes my dad's version better.  The service was really great!  My parents liked the friendly girl that could speak Chinese and laugh at my dad's bad jokes.  We also thought the menu prices were very reasonable with the bowls of noodles ranging from $7.95 to $9.95.  A great find for authentic Chinese noodles.",

    "text": "Summary:  Hey there. Are you looking for a quick meal? Do you want your quick meal to be better than run of the mill fast food chains? Are you also craving Asian food? Well the Magic Noodle is the perfect place for you! Caution: more addicting than you think. Also, if you don't know what to order, keep reading! It's definitely worth it ;)  Recommendations: Fried rice- I had the veggie fried rice and was thoroughly disappointed when it came out and wasn't dunked in soy sauce like others. I thought it would have NO FLAVOR (my worst nightmare). I couldn't stop eating it. I thought I was obsessed with it. Correction: I was obsessed with it. All their noodles and broths are good.   Overall experience: I'm not big on Chinese noodle dishes, but this place is glorious. I had to volunteer for face painting children and was running short on time. My friends and I decided to stop by here, and we were a little worried that they wouldn't be quick enough. One of my friends ordered the drunken noodle (if I remember correctly) and they said it'd take a longer time to make. I know the noodles here are handmade, so I started to really worry when my friend said it was okay for the noodles to take a while longer. Well we ended up getting it rly soon. Like a few minutes at most later than the rest of us. The service was really good; since we were in a rush my friend was a little hasty but our server did the best she could to fulfill our needs. Kudos to her.",

My soup had the perfect amount of noodles and damn are the noodles so good here. The soup was labeled as spicy but really I would say it was mild at best.   The Dan Dan noodles were good too. The pickled green beans provided a different but good flavor to the sauce. My partner couldn't finish his noodles and got a to go box. The male waiter came by and made a jab about how he couldn't finish it. HILARIOUS! We both chuckled.   The only reason I docked off a star was because their water tasted off. It had a funky smell and taste. We couldn't even finish our water because how off putting it was. Good thing I had soup broth.",

    "text": "After multiple visits, I'm confident that the Magic Noodle is definitely a 5-Star worthy LV noodle spot!  I know, I know...Everyone raves about Shang Artisan, which I also like, as well, and have frequented when I'm on Spring Mountain.  However, the Magic Noodle is so much better, and I go out of my way every time to come here!! One day, when scientific evidence finally proves that carbs are actually even more healthy than fruits and vegetables, you'll find me here every day!  The noodles here are excellent, which is what you come here for, right? I am partial to their wide flat noodles and their knife cut noodles. The noodles are 100% hand made, without the aide of any machines.  If you're fortunate to be there while they're making their knife shaved noodles, be sure to take an up close peek on how they deftly flick shavings of the noodles from the massive mound of dough directly into boiling water.  A noodle artisan can flick hundreds of these within a few minutes!  Don't leave without trying the plain onion pancakes with green onions.  They are perfect! Crispy, without the omnipresent over cooked brown edges, and are amazingly, not at all greasy!  They've managed to perfect these, and should share their best practices with all other Sichuan restaurants.  They are better than I've had anywhere in the Bay Area or in the entire LV Valley!  In fact, I'd come back for these alone.  The spicy wontons are also nice, but have a bit of a predominant hint of white pepper.  If that doesn't bother you, get these too.  Today, I tried the Zhajiang Noodles, and absolutely loved the al dente texture of the knife shaved noodles!  That said, I'd strongly suggest ordering the black bean sauce on the side.  The sauce itself was far from the greatest, and was significantly more watery-thin than I would've preferred, and overwhelmingly overly salty. I ended up only using a couple of teaspoons full.  But ah, those knife shaved noodles!  Service is very nice here, and the restaurant is new and clean (unlike many places in Chinatown).  All good, all the way around!",

We sort of just trusted and ate what was in front of us . We eventually got suspicious and asked . Sure enough mystery was solved lol .

Call them imperfect...or maybe say it's a True sign they are handmade. Regardless, the texture was fresh and delightful.   I found their broth to be superior to other handmade noodle shops. The chicken and mushrooms was outstanding. We also got the brisket. The brisket was far too fatty for my liking but the few meaty pieces were tender and delicious. The broth on this was pho-esque. The dan dan noodles were very spicy. Too spicy to be able to eat an entire bowl. A few bites would suffice.   It's cute inside. We got to watch them make noodles during our visit. Service was acceptable. They don't have any diet soda, only regular.  That's weird.   A definite winner for a steaming bowl of delicious Asian noodles. I'll be back for more magic noodles!",

The food was amazing and the glass view of the behind the scene on how they make the noodles was a plus - while you wait for your food. But that's not the reason why we love them.   Our son is allergic to peanuts (I think they should add a note to their menu to include this) and we ordered him the Chow Mein with chicken, unknowing that there was a hint of peanut in it. My son felt it, so we asked the waiter and he confirmed it. We quickly gave him an allergy medication and he was okay. The server was so frighten and apologetic about the situation and asked to remake the meal without the peanut sauce - we can see that they were all shaken about the ordeal and so were we. We asked him to make something more simple, that was not the menu and they made it. They even removed the Chow Mein order from our bill and sincerely apologized again. They also explained to me on how they take food allergy seriously and we're glad that they're not just some money hungry restaurant that doesn't care for their customer. Our experience would have been much worst if they were the opposite. So i applaud them for their amazing customer service and good heart. We'll def. return the next time we're in Vegas but we'll probably order something else for our son.",

    "text": "So disappointed bc this place was on my list to hit bc I just moved to Vegas a few weeks ago. I was looking fwd to it via the online photos etc.  We went today @3pm only a few tables in there maybe 10 + a few seats at the window where they cook. Took way too long for a bowl of wonton soup (@$8) which was seaweed a few soggy strings of bread or something weird and a few wontons-he said it tasted like a bowl of hot water-no flavor he tried to add Sriracha & spicy oil. Didn't help. The spicy dumplings were ok but the spice dust is too much. You'll have a bad free taste for hours. Blah. Why so stingy about napkins? I need more then 2\" ugh.  I spilled all over my shirt so don't wear anything nice just in case! I got chicken chow main- the noodles were ok but again it had a weird lasting taste. Too many onions not enough chicken and it tasted rubbery maybe they used this meat not white chicken breast. I miss Dumpling Inn in San Diego CA. They've got great noodle fresh dishes! Also didn't like seeing the guy in the glass kitchen area putting a bowl of raw chicken next to cooked food. Seemed like a salmonella nightmare waiting to happen. Wiping his hands o seem Dirty towel sitting in the counter. Made ya very nervous! Then we had to witness one of the female staff sitting at the bar area by the kitchen window eating some soup w/meatball or some meat-she was putting it in her mouth then taking her chopsticks and pulling it out of her mouth and putting them in her napkin! Omg what the heck was she doing?! Please have your employees eat somewhere else out of the customer view if they're spitting out food!! Gross. Sorry we won't be going back.",

I loved the spicy kick at the back of the tongue.  Brisket noodle soup - for my beef eating friends they loved it.  And the broth was very beef fragrant in a good way.    Spicy wontons - the reason why i only have 4/5 for review. There was barely any meat and the sauce was bland, not spicy eventho its in chili oil. Didnt have a kick to it.  Cucumber and fungus salad - the best! Ordered double portion. Perfectly seasoned with rice vinegar and salt.  Steamed chicken in chili oil - very bland and not much meat. It was mostly chicken skin.",

My favorites include -Zhajiang Noodles: sauce noodle, very refreshing and great taste. -Sweet and Sour Cucumber -Sweet and Sour Black Fungus salad -House Special Veggie Pancakes: best appetizer, a must try, it has a good texture when you bite into it, comes with dipping sauce. My friend commented that thier food is authentic and very similar to how it would be prepared in China. Prices are reasonable and you will get full....leftovers still taste good.

When entering you see the gentleman that makes the noodles right in front of you in the window. He is stretching and twisting the noodle dough. It is great food along with great entertainment! I tried the kung pao chicken with the regular noodles. It was very delicious! It was pleasantly spicy, not overly hot where you could not eat it. It came with the freshly made noodles, a delicious sauce, peanuts and crisp onions and peppers. This restaurant is somewhat small, so if you come with a group you may need to wait to sit. They were very busy but the staff was very attentive. And the price - was excellent! It was not very expensive to eat here. Definitely will return here again!",

    "text": "Chinese food on Christmas Eve is a tradition. But we've 86'd all the usual takeout places we used to patronize closer to home, after appearances on KTNV's Dirty Dining in one case, and a change of chef in another, made them no-go. So I went to Yelp and found The Magic Noodle. Despite the name, it didn't occur to me that this wasn't going to be the typical Chinese food place of our past, but oh, well, we go with the flow.   We brought along a bottle of wine, just in case they didn't serve it. Not only do they not, it was tolerated because it was Christmas Eve, but strongly discouraged other times. Good thing we thought to bring a corkscrew. And since I drink exactly two things - coffee and wine - the coffee mugs we were provided (to sort-of hide the contents) were perfectly okay with me.  Service was very friendly, and our waitress was patient with our questions. That was good, since there are virtually no explanations for menu items with Chinese names.  We started with a Szechuan dumpling appetizer, which was very tasty. I ordered Lan Zhou noodle soup, and my husband got the Szechuan beef brisket. But as soon as they were delivered, we switched dishes. He expected the brisket to be sliced, but these were chunks, and covered in fat. The Lan Zhou was sliced.  I thought I could handle the chunks of brisket, but it turned out to be so fatty that there was almost no meat to eat. I filled up a small plate completely with nothing but fat, and in the end there was virtually only soup and noodles. (The noodles were excellent and broth was good). The waitress brought me a small plate of the sliced Lan Zhou beef. I have no idea what kind of cut this is, but it was ice-cold, looked greenish in the center, and tasted weird to me.   The restaurant is clean and modern, the noodle-making show in the open kitchen is fascinating, the prices are reasonable, but to us it just wasn't worth the trip.",

My friend and I went here for dinner around 6:30 on a Friday. We got lucky and only had to wait for 5 minutes. There's no waiting area though as space is really tight and fully utilized, so we had to awkwardly stand by the entrance door while waiting. Located in the same plaza as thai noodle house and infused tea. Plenty of parking.  We tried their spicy wontons for appetizers and they're really good. The wonton skin was soft, while the filling was firm, giving you a nice texture. I could taste the shrimp and pork in the fillings too, so they didn't have much fillers. The chili sauce had a good flavor and went well with the wontons. It's quite pricey though. $6.50 for only 6 wontons.   For noodle soup, I had their Szechuan beef brisket noodle ($8.95). I chose to have their regular hand-pulled noodle. The noodles were cooked perfectly al-dente. However, the broth was not spicy at all. I was expecting that numbing spiciness that comes from Szechuan dishes, but nope, tasted just like a regular beef broth with some chili oil. The brisket was tender for the most part and they gave a lot of it too. I do like that their broth is not too salty.   Service was ok. Had to ask for water refills a couple times. The place is clean, but you will still smell like a beef soup after. Just like after you have pho lol. I would come back again and try their other soups.",

The soup is a little blend, for some people's opinion, but for me, it's perfect. My two other cousin ordered fried chow mein, also recommend this for those who want to try some dry food.

    "text": "First time here and I will be back for sure! My dad and I decided to come here for lunch after I had my tires changed at Walmart (across the street). It was a cold and windy day so this place definitely hit the spot.  House special pancakes (pork): this was sooo good. The dough was thin and had a nice crunch to it. The pork inside was cooked and seasoned perfectly. Highly recommend.   Lan Zhou noodle: my dad got this dish. He's a picky eater and even he admitted that the broth and noodles were tasty. He didn't get it spicy but you do have the option to make it spicy.   Fish noodle with pickled vegetables: if you love pickled veggies, then you'll love this dish. The broth was delicious and had a nice tang to it that wasn't overwhelming from the pickled veggies.   If there was one thing I could recommend, it would be to add more meat into these dishes. I think mine only came with 5 pieces of fish and my dad's came with 3 or 4 slices of beef. I do want to try the other stuff on their menu so I will be back :)",

I started with the spicy dumplings in Szechwan sauce which was recommended over spicy dumplings, the server said there's more flavor in The Szechwan sauce, highly recommended if you like garlic, lots of garlic .  These little dumplings were tasty but really difficult to eat with chopsticks so you may want to ask for a fork for these little guys.    For my entree I ordered my usual beef brisket Szechwan noodle soup with knife cut noodles.  The broth was so flavorful, meat tender and noodles were fresh!  Yes this soup is spicy so if you're looking for something to clear up your sinuses, this is the cure!    Restaurant is small so probably not great for groups but they do have a few booths and tables that can be put together.    There will more than likely be a wait here, every single time I've been in here the restaurant has pretty much been packed, a little awkward when waiting for a table or take out, no where really to stand without looking over the middle tables and standing over the current diners while waiting to experience what they are.    Portions are pretty big, I usually have leftovers and the leftovers are just as good and always a reminder as to how damn good these noodles are!",

Saw this place popped up.. and after viewing some snazzy looking pictures and reading some pretty good and honest reviews.. I decided to finally go...  Walking in.. it really reminded me of another noodle spot (The Noodle Man) on Rainbow and 215.. could be the same owners? Idk... but the decor and how there is a noodle bar and you can see the people making fresh noodles gives it that same feel... always interesting though to see someone tossing and twisting and flipping those noodles..   Service was pretty good given that this place started to get really pack the second we sat down.. it is very limited seating and they really could use more tables and chairs..   Food Review: Ordered the Spicy Brisket with original noodles. The portion weighed more on the broth as most noodles do... but the amount of brisket and noodles was ok.. maybe I'll try go the flat noodle way next time.. as I could've gotten extra noodles with my bowl. I also wished they had more veggies in there too.. the quality of taste is there.. of course being that the noodles are freshly made.. and the broth was very tasty.. could also have more spiciness though.. but you can always add more if you want.   Other than that, I'll definitely go again.. and maybe try a different item.   ENJOY!",

I like how the dishes were not too salty as sometimes noodle soups can be. The kitchen has a window where you can see workers hand pulling noodles. Service was excellent. Good prices. Clean, bright  place.  Pro tip: ask for the hoisin/plum sauce to go with the beef green onion roll. It usually comes with it inside but in this case it does not. Plaza parking, off strip.",

    "text": "I found The Magic Noodle on Instagram so I started to follow them and then bookmarked it in Yelp.   I had a doctors appt close by so we decided to have lunch here before my doctors appt.  I went with my sister, mom and family friend.  We arrived around 11:30am and it was packed in there already!    We ordered the beef and pork pancakes, beef burrito, cucumber salad, beef noodle soup and a zha zhang mein with extra sauce.    I enjoyed magic noodles beef burrito more than Mr Chopstix bcs MN puts in cucumbers and cilantro and it's quite tasty.  MrC only has green onions and sometimes puts too much oyster sauce.  The beef pancake tasted better than the pork but they were both piping hot and juicy.  The cucumber salad was a little disappointing bcs it smelled like the flavors were all there but when you taste it, the flavors haven't soaked into the cucumbers fully... it feels like it needs to marinate for another hour or so for the flavors to penetrate in.   The beef noodle soup was good but not great.  They used too much white pepper in it.  The meat was super tender and the veggies were fresh.  We actually shared the bowl between the 4 of us.   The server told us that the zha zhang mein sauce could get salty so we should mix in a little at a time.  She was right but I used almost all of it with the knife cut noodles since they were thick and wide and needed the extra sauce to coat everything.  I liked the amount of bean sprouts and cucumbers they had in the bowl.  Usually it's ground pork in the sauce but their sauce calls for pork chucks - different but pretty tasty.    The restaurant was busy all through our meal with ppl waiting for seats and for pick up.  There were 2 servers and they could probably use a little more help during the lunch hour... where's the owners or manager?  There were 3 cooks in the kitchen pumping out order after order.  We decided to order take out and we ordered chicken chow mein since it seemed like a really popular dish.  We also ordered 2 more noodle soups to go.  We weren't able to finish all our appetizers so they packed it up for us.  I like when  restaurants do that, that's called, service!   The chicken chow mein had plenty of chicken which was cool but they again used too much white pepper and a tad too much garlic so I didn't really enjoy it.    When we left the place I was so thirsty and kept drinking all this water... so that means they use msg in their food... my mom said the same thing too... aghhhh not cool!!!    I did enjoy the knife cut noodles and the beef burrito - but I don't think I'll make a special trip down there just for their msg, white pepper laden food.  I didn't even really take any pics for IG either...   My next doctors appt is in 3 months so I think we'll go back to Mr Chopstix for that appt... I gave this place 4 stars due to the servers being nice and helpful even during the lunch chaos.    Oh, they don't have any hot water... my mom always drinks hot water... kinda surprised us when they told us they don't have hot water... all chinese restaurants have hot water... this was a first for us... they should consider getting a tea kettle to have some hot water on hand and they can also serve some tea.  All their beverages are bottled.",

My party had to wait a little, but was treated with excellent customer service when at our table. The food was honestly mind blowing! My beef brisket noodle had the best tasting soup and meat. The soup was not too oily or salty, and was perfectly flavorful with each spoonful. The meat was probably my favorite part which is weird because it usually isn't for me- just goes to show how bomb it was. The meat fell apart so easily and I am now left questioning when my next visit to the restaurant will be hahaha   Now to get to the noodles itself. They were so chewy, which I liked. I got the regular noodles, which are thin, but I regret not getting the thick noodles. The waitress had mentioned thin is better, so I was (too easily and regrettably) swayed. I'll try the thick noodles next time.   Everything I had was good! Cucumbers, spicy wonton, beef wraps, and noodles- all things I would recommend",

Upon further inspection of noodles, I noticed they're all kinds of noodles of different sizes in the bowl. I put in half the sauce and it was enough to blow my doors. Like I said it was okay, and I've ordered in the past from Shanghai Artisan noodle and it was the best. I tried some of the beef brisket from the Szechuan beef brisket soup. I thought the beef was very tender and flavorful. I did not sample the soup though. The spicy wontons were pretty good.  And the beef burrito was served cold which should be mentioned in the the menu. Not a fan of cold food.",

The hand-pulled noodles were perfect, but there was something about the broth that I found lacking.  It just wasn't flavorful enough to me.  Maybe it was an off night, but it wasn't as good as I had hoped it would be.  The amount of brisket in the soup was good, not too much, not too little.  I will have to come back and try it again, but for the time being, I'd say it was just okay.",

The hand pulled noodles are so perfectly chewy, and their broth for each soup pairs so perfectly to never make them mush. Let me tell you though, taking it home and reheating it is never the same, so inhale it all when you go!  I highly recommend the spicy dumplings, onion pancakes, or the beef burrito to start. The szcheuan beef brisket with hand pulled noodles is the main star of their menu. I did try the thick and wide noodles with, freaking tasty too!",

I've been here 3 times now, and each time it's been food-tastic!   The Szechuan beef brisket is so tender and flavorful and goes well with the broth and veggies if it's your first time here. Would also recommend the spicy Szechuan dumplings to start, you won't be disappointed.    Magic Noodle is located in a plaza where there are lots of other awesome choices as well so there's a little bit everything for everyone if noodles aren't what you're in the mood for.  But if it is, enjoy and slurp away as loud as you want.",

Everything is made scratch in house from the noodles to their house chili sauce. There is a big window you can see the worker making the noodles. You can order original, knife cut, or flat wide noodles to any dish.  I recommend the spicy Szechuan beef brisket (#C4) with flat noodles. The house made chili gives the broth so much bold and rich flavor. It's a joy in every bite! If you can't eat spicy, opt for C3 which is the same without the house chili. I also recommend the beef house special pancake and spicy wonton if you have an appetite. This place will not dissapoint. So grab your friends and take a trip to this place.",

It is a huge portion and I couldn't even finish it myself, but so worth it. It took a little bit of time to receive my food but they were nice enough give me a free soft drink. Definitely coming back and trying their other items!",

    "text": "We arrived and everything was very clean and new. We ordered red braised beef noodle soup, house chow mein, and their gyoza/potstickers. I originally wanted the vegetable chow mein and asked our waiter if that was good and his response was, \"if that's what you like.\" And then I said well you work here.. have you tried the noodles?? Did you like them? What would you recommend? So that's how we ended up choosing the house chow mein.   The beef noodle soup came out and we were eating. It was very salty and not as rich as beef noodle soup is supposed to be.   The chow mein came out and it was good. It was tasty.. But salty also. The house chow mein comes with shrimp, pork, chicken, and beef. The whole works. I wonder if the vegetable one would have came out the exact same except with vegetables and if the waiter only suggested the house one over the vegetable one bc he liked how it came with a lot of meat.. as most guys would enjoy that kind of dish. I on the other hand do love my veggies.   The gyoza/potstickers came out and I really liked them! I liked them so much I ordered another. But at the same time I also wondered if I liked them so much bc I was hungry hahahahah and didn't really eat much of the 2 salty noodle dishes.   The bill came and I was disappointed and surprised at how much the gyoza/potstickers were!... $7.50 for 6 pieces.. the 6 pieces were in actuality only 3 since they cut it in half.  Imagine an egg roll.. cut diagonally. The chow mein was $8.99.   Safe to say at least I tried it.",

I tried both the Mongolian beef chow mein and the beef brisket noodles (not pictured). I'd definitely recommend the Mongolian beef chow mein but for the beef brisket noodles I would be wary if you prefer a moderately savory/salty broth as this one was pretty salty. Both dishes were served with flat wide noodles which had an extremely nice texture and chew. I wouldn't exactly deem this restaurant as a 5/5 as I felt it lacked any redeeming, special qualities setting it apart from any other noodle restaurant. But I still recommend it to anyone who loves good handmade noodles!",

The spicy wonton has the perfect between sweet, salty, and spicy. Super delicious. The portion was just right. The Lan Zhou noodles was really good also. The noodles were perfectly cooked, not too hard, not too soft. The noodles had just enough springiness to it (all noodles are made in house). Would recommend the soup for anyone that wants a soup that is not too overpowering with seasoning or too plain. Definitely does the soul good on a cold night.",

You walk in the place and see guys hand pulling noodles behind a glass window so I don't think the noodles could be any fresher. The first time I visited I got the beef brisket soup. Tons of meat and flavorful broth. When my waiter checked up on me, he offered more soup and I obliged him. No extra charge. Nice touch!  Earlier this week, I had the house special chow mein. Great sauce, chunks of chicken and pork and a few shrimp in there as well. I might have licked the plate if nobody was around. The guy sitting next to me at the noodle bar (if that's what it's called?) was obviously a regular as the waiter insisted he try something different this time. The guy refused and I couldn't help but chuckle. He got the onion pancake appetizer; I haven't tried them but he seemed to enjoy. I don't remember what entree he ordered but apparently everything at this place is amazing.  Please stay away so I don't need to wait next time I come back.",

I came because I love Pho and Ramen so I wanted to give Chinese Noodle Soup a try. The presentation is made my mouth water as you can imagine by the picture. I had the spicy beef noodle soup (can't remember the actual name). It was really tasty and quite spicy but I didn't realize this dish is a ground beef dish which isn't my preference. I will come back and try another soup. It was really inexpensive as well. I left under $10!! Service was very fast as well. I do recommend this place. Give it a try next time you're in the area.",

We took a seat at the bar so I could see into their open kitchen. I especially liked the show that the noodle guy put on, although I might have made him a bit nervous with my staring, but he should be used to it.   Only suggestion I have is to let the waitress know what kind of noodles you want. I made the mistake of ordering by the number with the picture and got the hand pulled noodles even though the picture on the menu was clearly shaved noodles. And the waitress didn't ask even when we informed her it was our first time here. They were hesitant to switch it for me...but the shaved noodle was bomb.",

    "text": "I heard about this place for little while now. So when my friend visiting from Honolulu came into town, I thought that this hand-pulled noodle joint would be a perfect place to have lunch since it's not to far from my house.  We arrived at 12:45 pm on a Thursday.  There were 8 people lining up outside and I thought to myself, this better be worth the wait.  I went inside to put down my name on the wait list and was quite surprised that within 5 minutes my name was called and we were seated. The restaurant is not too big with an open kitchen concept. Through the glass, we watched one of their noodle masters making these \"magic\" noodles by pulling and swirling the noodles into thin uniform noodles.  They don't mind you going up to their window to have a closer look or to snap a few photos. The cook will even pose for you.  The menu is only one page, front and back, but has quite a few items on it.  Many of their menu items are spicy and are identified with a chili symbol next to them.  We both ordered their staple noodles.  I ordered the beef brisket flat wide noodles and my friend ordered the Lan Zhou noodles (noodle soup with slices of cooked beef). We also shared an order of their pan fried onion pancakes. Everything came out pretty fast.  I really enjoyed my savory bowl of noodle. The broth and beef were very flavourful and the texture of the noodle was perfect.  My friend said he enjoyed his bowl of noodle as well.  The onion pancakes were also quite tasty, crispy on the outside and soft inside. While we were eating, there were non-stop people waiting to be seated. My verdict, this place serves wonderfully fresh and delicious hand-pulled noodles.  I am definitely a fan and yes, it was definitely worth the wait!",

Luckily we missed the lunch rush, so we were greeted and sat quickly with very prompt water service.  We got the treat of seeing the noodle man handmaking the noodles, so definitely worth the wait since the times I've went to Noodle Man, there was no noodle maker!  With the help of our server, Benny, we picked out their house special Beef Brisket Noodle  (next visit will be with the knife cut noodle) and Mongolian Beef Chow Mein.  The broth of the beef brisket noodle had great depth and body to it. Noodles were al dente, with enough bite. And the seasoning all through out was amazing. For someone whose allergies are working on overtime and can still discern the taste of the dish, it makes me wonder how others can say their food is bland...   The Mongolian Beef Chow Mein had great spice and heat. Definitely made my nose run, but not horribly. Fifteen minutes in I'm surprised my allergies weren't kicking in to overdrive. With all the soy sauce that they use, most Asian restaurants I go to my sinuses are already going full force, but not here.   The highlight of the meal was when I kiddingly asked our waiter, \"As you can see, my friend is white, are you sure he can handle the spice levels?\" Without missing a beat, he said it's not the spicy but throughout the meal, he was very nice to ask to make sure it really wasn't spicy haha. Sorry Larry, love you friend!  Definitely coming back to try their other dishes. Move over Noodle Man.  Too bad they don't have a dessert menu :-3",

The broth has hints of star anise and bits of nostalgia.  Beef Brisket Noodle: tasty and flavorful, a good break from all the spicy food we order. Never disappoints.  Dan Dan Noodle: love how there was a lot of cucumber and bean sprouts to counteract with the spice.  Mongolian Beef Chow Mein: I was never a fan of chow mein because it's super oily, but the noodles were extra chewy and they weren't drenched in oil. Plus!

The ingredients for the dishes from fried rice to ramen are fresh, zesty and filling. My favorites are the chicken and mushroom soup and the chicken chow mein. On top of that, the prices are soooo cheap! It's around the price of a Panda Express meal, but far less processed and doesn't leave you with that gross, greasy feeling. Every time I come here the service is always excellent and the food of consistent quality. A must try!!",

    "text": "So finally got around to checking out The Magic Noodle. I was in carb recovery kind of mood post long bike day. I had noodles on my mind and thought of the perfect spot that been on my radar. So first impression was really like the interior with the original artwork one of the walls, the open kitchen look always favorite, and ample seating from counter area to tables. Truthfully it set up like lot of Ramen or Noodle shops around the valley or the ones I have been to. The menu is nothing crazy only two pages but has most of your favorites soup base noodles, sauce noodles, stir-fried and fried rice plus appetizers. The key or trending is the noodles  fresh made or really not keeping up with the times. Lol. It was lot of decisions only because it was my first time. I ended up settling for the Mongolian Beef Chow Mein and since first time had get appetizer went with the Onion Pancake.   The Onion Pancake asked my server if should go with the add egg. He told me is very popular but wanted try the pancake without no distractions. It was pretty awesome. The texture is little bit like pancake. It not as fluffy or looks like pancake. I more like pita bread kind of. It filling like bread, see the onions, not over powering but definitely can taste the green onion, and nice starter or like getting basket of bread. Maybe if add the egg game changer?? I enjoyed it and would recommend it as starter.  The Mongolian Beef Chow Mein was awesome. The portion size is generous and not doubt get your money worth in food. I love! Hearty this dish was with ample amounts of noodles. The vegetables and the beef felt like every bite got the best of all worlds. It had nice depth of flavor in the sauce. Solid noodle dish.   The service was five stars!!!!! The gentlemen was awesome since it was my first time. Never had empty glass of water. Checked several times make sure everything was good. Friendly.   The Magic Noodle player in the noodle game for me. I love the fact close to home for me. No doubt plan on coming back cause barely tapped the menu. Till my next noodle recovery meal. lol!",

Of course, the soup is a key cog in any noodle soup bowl. It was excellent and had great flavor.",

I have to say the noodles are fresh and is pretty good. I would definitely recommend the knife cut noodles for those would like fresh made noodles with a bit of a chewy texture to it. The soup had an okay flavor, just a bit of more spice would make it better! Overall, I found the flavor of the broths ok, the noodles were definitely fresh, and one of the side dishes I had ordered, the spicy wonton, I think it was called, was definitely delicious!",

The food here is just ok. I had the \"beef burrito\" aka taiwanese beef roll, and the pork pancake to start. The pancakes are long and rectangular, not like the normal shape of this dish at most places. The beef roll was a small portion for $6.50 and was just mediocre at best, like the kitchen didn't really care when they made this. I ordered a C1 lan zhou soup and subbed knife sliced noodles for my entree. The soup broth had a pleasant taste. Although whoever cut my noodles needs to learn to be a little more uniform in their slicing. Some were really thin, and some were way too thick and not cooked in the middle. And the chili sauce which is on the table, they need to fix this. Has no flavor at all, it's not spicy, just tastes like straight oil and sesame. That was really disappointing. But they are a new restaurant and probably still figuring things out, so I'll give it another try in the future.",

    "text": "I was SO excited to come and try this place out after seeing some pictures of the food on instagram. What caught my eye was the wide cut noodles.. looked delicious! When I came in, I sat down and ordered the spicy brisket soup noodle. After a few mins minutes of ordering, I realized the waitress never asked what type of noodles I wanted. I grabbed her attention and made sure she knew I was here for the wide cut noodles, not original. She proceeded to tell me how original was the best for this kind of soup and that's how they usually make it. She wasn't rude about it, but we literally went back and fourth for a while until I finally gave up and told her, \"you know what? Bring me whatever it is you think is best for this type of soup\". I don't know if it was the language barrier or she really just wanted me to try the regular noodles? I didn't understand. How hard was it to get the plate on the picture? I used to be a server so I wasn't going to make a scene about it either. I was just disappointed. The soup overall was good.... but hey, could have been better with the noddles I wanted. I honestly left there pretty unsatisfied.",

    "text": "I really liked the Lan Zhou noodles! They were delicious. Also the cold cucumber appetizer was super garlicky, sour and delicious. Plus points for the Chinese TV in the background that was playing some delicious looking cooking show. My fiancee got the Chong Ching noodles, which were pleasantly mala.  This feels like a strange reason to knock the review down a peg, but I did notice that this restaurant has no ambient music. Maybe it was the day I was there, but there was no background music at all. This lead to easily hearing conversations in the kitchen, as well as from other customers. I prefer there at least to be some background music to set the tone. As it was...it just felt quiet. I would have appreciated some tone-setting tunes.  We're getting down to the nitty gritty again, but the owner/server seemed like in a big rush to do everything- set down utensils, clear tables, and take orders. Not that it's bad to do things quickly, but I picked up a rushed, almost frantic vibe. I guess it's good for speed of service though.  Price is great, service is quick. Highly recommend.",

I went with the spicy wontons to start off, and then got the Szechuan beef brisket with knife cut noodles. The taste was GREAT! I usually add more spice to my food, but this had just the right amount of spice. The noodles were just right. I will definitely be returning to try more stuff.",

I'm normally not this big of a good snob but when it comes to Sichuan, I know what's good.  I would need to go back to try the other noodles, but would not recommend the thick knife cut noodles.

    "text": "It is so sad that most of the reviews state how excellent their service was, but you receive the total opposite. The owner Andy and his employees don't care their customer when there is a problem, all they think about just MONEY and MORE MONEY!!!!!!!!!!  On Sunday 7/22/18, I ordered a togo which contains Sezchuan Beef Brisket Noodle, Spicy Wonton, Spicy Beef Shank w/ Beef Tenderloin, and Steamed Chicken w/Chili Sauce. The following day, the food gave me a really bad food poison. I was having diarrhea, migraine, and whole body was sort and tired. I ended up taking antibiotic to kill all the bacteria and pain killer to release my migraine.  When I feeling a little better on Tuesday, I contacted the restaurant and asked to speak to the manager or owner. The server asked me what is it about and I told him that I got food poison after eating the food from this restaurant. I was immediately told they are not here and will be back tomorrow.   So I called this morning and the food server asked the same question what is this about. So I told him that I got food poison after eating the food from food here, he immediately told me the owner or manager is not here. So I told him that I called yesterday and was informed they will be here today.  the food server was like oh, let me see if they are here. So magically he was able to put Bill (dont know what is his position) on the phone. I re-explained what happened and Bill said it could be the weather that cause you to have diarrhea. And I said \"you are funny. this is the first time I heard weather can cause diarrhea.\" The he changed to maybe the stuff you drink. Bill just keep coming up with excuses. He did take down my contact info and said the manager will contact me asap which is a lie. The owner Andy was there and he is not willing to talk to me (see below).  The thing that Bill didn't know was that I can understand both Cantonese and Mandarin. Andy only speaks Mandarin and Bill speaks both. From the background while I was on hold, I heard Bill explained what is going on to Andy in Mandarin and Andy told Bill just say he is not here which was what I was informed.   This is the first and last time I will eat in this restaurant and hopefully they can pass the health inspection when the SNHD comes.",

You can chose between 3 types of noodles, the OG hand pulled noodles (long spaghetti like noodles), knife shaved and the thick noodles. I personally love the thicker noodles because you get a doughy taste to them.  My favorite dish was C4, the spicy Szechuan beef noodle soup. The beef was so tender and I love their broth, but you can also add vinegar and more spices if you want! Also a must is the onion pancake appetizer. I will be making the trip back to Vegas solely for this restaurant.",

When we arrived last night, we were seated immediately although we probably came at just the right time because the place was full of patrons.  Mr. Wang was pulling noodles almost the whole time we were there (I only know his name because I asked our server who that hard-working bespectacled fellow was behind the glass).  That's the free show part.  The delicious part came when we had our noodles. I chose the knife cut noodles for the Beef Brisket soup.  These noodles were just the right consistency, not too firm and not too soft.  I loved the tender beef brisket served with the soup, as well, with its nice flavor and quite a generous amount of beef.  Service was great throughout our meal as we were checked on often and our water glasses were never empty.  I would definitely recommend this place for a magical meal.",

    "text": "The noodles here are by far a 5 star rating!! But the service well that's a different story. I brought my boyfriend and son here for lunch recently, so it was very busy. The waiter asked us to wait for a larger family to finish with the main table to seat us, instead of having us sit at one of the two readily available smaller tables to the side, and was going to sit the woman who had come in after us at one of the said smaller tables instead. I explained we were on a time crunch and the smaller table would be okay. Even the woman behind us was confused as to why they wanted to skip us and have us wait... we waited a good 20 minutes before getting served any drinks. We ordered our food with our drinks and I would say it took at least 40 minutes before being served any of our food items, even appetizers. Even the same woman that was behind us in line, who ended up sitting next to us and was super sweet, was annoyed and confused as to why she and her date had been served immediately but not us. Long story short, I think the woman who took our order forgot to put it in, and our original waiter had no clue what was going on it seemed. People all around us seemed to be waiting on something, and granted it was busy, I noticed staff doing other tasks like making pre-wrapped silverware sets instead of tending to customers, as if they had just forgotten.   The food is VERY good, but the beef brisket seems to be just a bunch of fatty meat each time I've ordered it. I will still continue to enjoy their noodles but probably to-go from here on out.",

Feeling a little under the weather, I chose the Szechwan Brisket soup (monstrous bowl and very spicy), my hubs chickened out with the hand-pulled noodle chow mein and a side of the wrapped pork pancakes--delicious!! Waiter told us we were smart to come in late as every dinner and lunchtime they're packed and on Fri & Sat nights, people wait hours to get in! Hard to believe cuz it's such a modest but well-appointed casual place but it is quite small. Fun to watch the guy behind the glass pulling the noodles--who knew? Go--you won't regret it!",

I had the spicy dumplings and the C4 Szechuan beef noodle ... I feel like I'm totally butchering the name. And the dumplings stole the show. 10/10 would recommend. The noodles were super delicious too, I loved how the noodles were fresh and cooked to the perfect texture. You totally get your monies worth with the amount of food you're given, and the server was amazing and checked up on us multiple times asking how our food was. And their food is just aesthetically pleasing, totes IG worthy.   My only complaint is that I wish there was more salt & flavor to the broth but that could be my Filipino talking as well. Great place & great food and I plan on coming back in the future!",

The food did not disappoint.  I ordered the beef brisket noodle soup with knife cut noodles. The noodles were probably the only minor negative for me. Being knife cut, they were naturally imperfect, going from thick and chewy on one end to super thin on the other. Next time, I'll try their hand-pulled noodles so I can get my slurp on. I thought the beef and the broth were flavorful with the meat being incredibly tender.  We also tried the sweet and sour black fungus salad. Definitely up there on my list of favorite types of fungus! I just love the texture.",

We ordered the beef noodle, spicy won ton, and the Mongolian beef noodle plate. The spicy won ton was by far the best tasting sauce I have had since my frequent visits to Chengdu. The beef noodle soup had an excellent broth with very tender beef. There was nothing magical about the taste of the fresh noodles, but the broths and sauces make up for it.",

I had doubts about the Sichuan (szechuan) experience in Las Vegas, but my buddies who have lived here for over a year brought me to this place while I interviewed for a job. They helped me figure out how to get the experience I looked for, so I got the hand-pulled noodles with beef brisket soup.  Typically, in the San Gabriel Valley (in Southern California), a default sichuan dish would be spicy right away. This one was mild by default, but the sichuan peppers still kicked-in so my mouth was a little numb ('cuz i'm a closet-masochist and I enjoy this experience like Trevor James @ The Food Ranger). I've been told they can amp up the spiciness as you please, but if you're bringing people who aren't used to spicy food-- this place will work as an intro to sichuan food. Fantastic flavor!  My friends still visit this place as a go-to and it isn't even on Spring Mountain Rd where the majority of asian food/restaurants are at.",

    "text": "We ordered the wontons in spicy sauce and the Szechuan noodles in beef broth. Make sure you specify whether you want thick or thin noodles because they will assume thin. Unfortunately my party did not know this and asked for a change in our order from the thin noodle to the thick noodle. Although the manager insisted we try thin, he reluctantly switched out our order to thick noodles after we asked a second time.  The noodles themselves were good! Thick and chewy. However, the broth was MAD spicy. The Szechuan spice made my tongue burn like a MF almost to the point of it being unenjoyable.   I'd probably go back just for the wontons.",

I had just arrived to vegas that and after a long nap it was lunch time, I yelped for noodles and found this place near by where my friend lives... It is authentic chinese noodles and for those who know me... i'm a snob on chinese food and noodles!   This place has hand made noodles and you can have them cut in whatever way you like....   Green onion pancakes (4/5): thin and crispy. went well with the chili oil sauce. It wasn't burnt which is a plus!  C4 Szechuan brisket beef w/ knife cut noodles (4/5): broth wasn't as spicy so i added more chili oil but they put lots of beef briskets.   C1 Lan zhou w/knife cut (3/5): not spicy broth more of a pork base and flavor was ok.   Service is good, even though the place is small... the workers are hustling... They do speak chinese but I spoke in english when I ordered.",

Much like Shaang and Noodle Man, Magic Noodle offers a similar menu of housemade noodle dishes, rices, and apps, served in a wood-accented dining room where the focal point is a glassed-in kitchen where the staff are stretching and pulling the noodles to order. The guys here have been especially great about putting on a show for the camera, so whip out your phone and get it on the 'gram.  I always have to order spicy wontons if I see them on a menu, and the version here were generously portioned and very thinly-skinned, with a great house-made chili oil sauce. The Szechuan Beef Noodle Soup is a huge portion of \"spicy\" (not really) broth with chunks of beef brisket, broccoli, and plenty of noodles- specify knife-shaved for the chewy, curly style I like best.  Looking forward to revisiting for the pancakes and burrito apps next time!",

The noodles are made in house which is common in the San Gabriel Valley of So Cal. It was lunch time and I ordered the spicy beef noodle soup and pork belly & green onion pancakes. The pancakes were a smaller portion that I normally get - but the flavor and texture was spot on. The beef noodle soup was also hearty, tasty and just as good as the places I frequent in So Ca. I chatted with the owner who was younger and friendly just like my server.  Credit cards are accepted here. I would definitely recommend Magic Noodle if you're in the area and craving fresh hand pulled noodles.",

First impressions walking in, it's a nice setup.  Because I was alone, I opted to sit at the bar, especially because I could see the kitchen hand making the noodles.  Lunch and show.  On this visit, I opted for chicken and mushroom.  Once it came out and letting it sit a few minutes to cool down, the first thing I did was to taste the soup.  The soup was bland.  I then made the slow attempt to taste the mushroom and it was fantastic, as well as the chicken.  Eat the noodle, soup, chicken and mushroom certainly tasted great. And just to be sure, tasting the soup when it was the only thing left had very little taste.  Good service, ok broth, great noodles, chicken and soup, clean restaurant and nice atmosphere.  I'll be back for sure.",

    "text": "What a cute little spot!  This cafe serves freshly made noodles, including their famous \"knife cut\" ones, on the premises, and behind a glass partition so that you can see the action as it happens.  You can then order said bespoke noodles in a soup, such as the beef brisket one with spicy broth and vegetables, as I did, on a wintry cold (for Las Vegas) day last week.  It was delicious.  The chef made some really good decisions here.  The broth is super well-balanced, even the spicy version, with just the right amount of seasoning, spices, and aromatic herbs and vegetables.  You could separate the chunks of beef with a spoon, it was so tender, and yet, it did not fall apart in the soup.  Seems as though someone knows exactly what they are doing in the kitchen.  The noodles did not disappoint or spoil the party, either.  I ordered--against my server's advice--the knife-cut noodles.  He thought I would not enjoy them since they may be, apparently, an \"acquired\" taste.  He suggested that I have the thinner noodles, or else the wide noodles that are not cut with a knife.  These tend to be less chewy and therefore, it goes, more palatable to Westerners.  Respectfully, he was wrong! (And to his credit, he was happy about that--and beamed broadly when he saw me slurping up my soup and noodles, joining the \"clean plate,\" er, \"bowl\" club).  I liked the wide, chewy noodles with the soup.  They did not take away from the flavor of the broth, but did not totally soak it up, either.  It was distinct, yet integrated, like a complementary relationship.  And the texture was chewy, but not unlike an al dente pasta, if you know what I mean.  The only reason for the star knock-off is the seating.  It is a very small cafe, and it can feel a bit claustrophobic.  I think they could use the space a teeny bit better, too.  There is a table to the right, that seems to store odds and ends, that could be cleared off and dispatched to accommodate more customers.  I also see a possibility for another bar along the other side of the noodle display kitchen for seating (assuming the Fire Dept. has no problem with a more narrow hallway).  The kitchen could probably use less space, too, in favor of more seating.  As it is, you should expect to wait at least 15-20 minutes or so to be seated, and then you will be in a closely cramped quarters, and in an uncomfortable chair.  Leave your coat and bags in the car.  If they can fix this, it will be a contender for \"perfect.\"",

You cannot go wrong with handmade noodles made right in front of you! There was so much to choose from on the menu that I did not know what I wanted to get. The waiter gave me his suggestion and told me the favorite among most customers, the C4 Szechuan Beef Brisket Noodle. I am not usually a spicy food kind of person, mainly because I can't handle spicy but I asked if they could lessen the spice for me and it was perfect! The broth was so warm and delicious and the noodles were amazing. Definitely a place to go anytime you are in the mood for fresh noodles. You definitely won't be disappointed!",

The Yelp reviews looked promising, and this place did not disappoint. Got seated promptly during normal lunch time, noon. The place was busy but not crazy busy. Order was taken quickly and water was served. I ordered a \"lemon iced tea\" which turned out to be a can of Brisk Lemon Iced Tea. Would never have ordered that but . Anyway, I ordered the C4, Szechuan Beef Brisket Noodle bowl and my wife ordered the Chicken Chow Mein. The interior decor is really well done and welcoming , and it is neat to see the noodles and food being made behind the glass. The tables are somewhat on the small side, with only a few booths for bigger parties. There are tables for 4 as well.  It took a normal amount of time for our food to be served, and it was presented nicely and I had the option of getting a fork. Appearance of the food was a 10 for sure. There were big pieces of brisket in the broth, and daaaang they were tender and really flavorful, almost like they'd been marinated and/or slow cooked. The noodles were cooked perfectly and were SO yum!! I would definitely order the C4 again. My wife was very happy with hers as well, and it too, was presented nicely. All in all, loved the atmosphere, loved the food, prices were perfect, service was fine, I will definitely return for my noodle fix and definitely recommend this place to friends",

They were all delicious, but they all had a lot of oil, that would be my only detraction from this eating experience.  We then got several soup noodle dishes, fried rice and chow mein.  All were outstanding, with condiments available to increase the heat level.  The service was prompt, courteous, and professional.  In the future, if they could add a soda fountain and unlimited ice tea, that would be a plus.  I highly recommend this place.",

It's located next to a few other local businesses such as \"Sweet Addiction Cookies and Ice Cream.\" Parking is spacious.  Entering The Magic Noodle, there is open seating. You can watch as the chefs make the noodles from scratch and also watch them cook your meal!  There was plenty of options on the menu. I selected their Garlic Chicken noodle dish. I was pleasantly surprised at how flavorful the dish is! The noodles tasted amazing - fresh and home-made! The chicken was cooked well, it wasn't over-cooked or under cooked. The Garlic was not overwhelming and the dish wasn't spicy! Just a tip, you can ask them to make your dish mild if you do not like spice.  Just to note, when it was about 5:30, the place was packed!! There was about 15 people waiting for their food orders or waiting for a open table! Try to get there early before rush hour or go later in the day!  This food is amazing though! I'd recommend trying The Magic Noodle once! The only reason why I am giving it 4 out of 5 was when I was there eating, there were several people complaining about the way that there food was cooked. Supposedly there was one of the chefs not wearing gloves and he was touching the noodles, and then handling dishes. The individuals were upset and were sort-of making a scene in the restaurant unfortunately.",

My sister recommended this place and I really liked it. First off kudos to the server working there, he was very honest about the menu and made honest recommendations and did not just say yes to what I asked for when he knows it would not be a good choice, I appreciate the honesty! I ordered the first noodle and asked for knife cut noodle and the server said that is not a good choice because the broth works better with the regular noodle so of course I went with his recommendation!  We both got the first noodle on the menu (forgot what it's called), and it was so good. Noodle was fresh and chewy, broth was simple but so flavorful with a little chili providing a nice kick. The only thing that threw me off was the meat, it had that \"fridge\" smell that was a little strong. It was not inedible or anything but ruined the noodle a bit.   I cannot wait to come back and try more.",

Regardless we were seated promptly and I like that they give you a glass of water without having to ask. The service was great and my glass never went below half empty. The food made me feel even nostalgic and that's a compliment. My wife and I got the brisket soup and Mongolian noodles with original noodles and it was amazing. We will definitely be coming back. 4 stars instead of 5 since my wife went with her friends a few days prior around 9pm. She mentioned that the service was horrible but the quality and taste of the food made up for it.",

The Magic Noodle is a little bigger.  It's clean and has great customer service.   We ordered:  -Sliced Pork Garlic Sauce (If you love pork and garlic, this dish is a must!) -Spicy Beef Shank with Beef Tenderloin (Meaty, it wasn't bad.  We were hoping it was similar to another dish at Chef Hung in Irvine.  We miss their Spicy Beef Tendon.  This dish has the same taste, but different texture since we had beef tendon there.  Fresh and cold.) -C1  Lan Zhou Noodle (Clean broth, fresh noodles, I think I like the noodle texture at Noodle Man better.  But this is still very good.) -C3  Beef Brisket Noodle  (Husband had this noodle soup and he really liked it.)  We enjoyed the service and food here.  Only about 2 miles away from home.  Happy there is another noodle spot similar to The Noodle Man, since it's a pain to drive to off the Rainbow.  Also, in the summertime this place should be cooler than The Noodle Man.  This store doesn't get the afternoon sun.",

Sometimes the broth is super flavorful some days and others it's more bland. That would be my only real complaint.

It's now my favorite thing to eat in Vegas. It's a small place in a random strip mall and from the outside you have no idea how unique and delicious the food inside truly is.  The spicy dumplings are wonderful. Get your own and don't share, trust me. I got the spicy beef broth with regular noodles. The broth is homey, delicious and rich, slow cooked on the back of the burner low and slow. Hints of ginger and cilantro. Big chunks of beef. Just enough spice to have a kick, yet not kill your stomach. The noodles are handmade right in front of you, and they are perfectly irregular in thickness, giving away the fact that they are handmade with love. Perfectly cooked. You can't help but slurp and gulp up all that delicious noodle soup. It's very affordable Asian comfort food at its finest, and I find myself craving it even now as I type this. Yum! I'll come back every time I'm in Vegas for sure.",

    "text": "This brand new spot features delicious Chinese hand pulled noodles featured in delicious broths and sauces.  Beef Brisket Noodle (soup) - DELICIOUS. The broth is truly amazing and reminiscent of Oxtail soup, but better lol. The noodles and their variance in thickness was very pleasant in this flavorful but light broth.  The meat was so tender and again very flavorful.    House Chow Mein Noodles - Featured a variety of veggies and meats but was very flavorful. Definitely not your average chow Mein!  Spicy Won Ton - Good, not what I was expecting but very good nonetheless.  Beef Pancake - So fun and yummy! It says 3 pieces but they're not small pieces at all, so do get it!   Food:  Great. Fun environment, entertaining to watch and all in all great.  The noodles they give you in each meal is A LOT - don't be like us and eat so fast you get full quickly lol.  -1 Star on Service: Serving slightly slow but they're new and trying to figure out their systems and processes, as with all new restaurants.  Plus they have to hand make your noodles so I do appreciate that.  I look forward to them growing and settling in their processes.  Delicious and enjoyable, I highly recommend and will visit again!",

Lots of their dishes only have a couple different vegetables in them, so if you happen not to like one or both of those vegetables it can ruin that dish for you. However, this is one of the few places I have been which cooks flavor into their vegetables well enough that you can enjoy eating them on their own, so I would recommend trying the vegetables, even if you normally would not like that type of vegetable. The beef is very obviously high cut and we'll prepared: soft and lovely. Be aware that you will not be seated within 30 minutes of the advertised closing time, but the food they prepare you for takeaway is fully up to par. The descriptions on the menu are not detailed, feel free to try to get a better details from the server. Also: FREE TEA!",

    "text": "This place was my favorite noodle place for awhile.  I can visit the place 2-3 times a week.  It is possibly the most authentic Chinese noodle place in Vegas.  This place remind me of the street vendors when I was in China more than 20 years ago.   I am writing this to let the management know that I am not going back for minimum of 12 months.  Because the food is so good, I can over look the poor services and horrible sanitation.  Until  one day, my 6 year old son and I was completely ignored in the place for 20 minutes.  Our order was taken for awhile and the customers came after us were taking care of.  When my son told me the 3rd time \"Dad, I am hungry.\"  This is enough.",
