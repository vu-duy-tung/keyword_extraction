    "text": "We came here around 1:30pm on a Sunday and they were closing up and wanted to get rid of the last couple of donuts they had. We had 2 options: BOGO or one box for $10. The box deal was so much more worth it so we ended up getting 16 donuts for $10!!! WHAT A STEAL. Plus if you check in on Yelp you can get either a free Americano or drip coffee. #win  Blueberry Lemon - Just okay, but I liked how it wasn't as sweet as I thought it would be.  Strawberry Split - Meh. I wouldn't get this again. The donut was just cinnamon and dry (probably because it had been sitting out all day) and the whipped cream inside was dry and tasted like it came from a can. The strawberries were also very plain and it would've been better if they were glazed.  Creme Brulee - My favorite out of everything I tried. The crunchy glaze on top was cool, and I love filled donuts. After eating half though, the cream inside started tasting artificial like cheap cake frosting so I had to come back to it.  Buttermilk Bar - I really liked the consistency of this! Moist and cake-like on the inside and nice and crunchy on the outside.  The other donuts look bomb so I'm definitely going to come try some other flavors. I agree that I've had better donuts elsewhere, but this location just opened 3 months ago so maybe their quality will go up. Street parking was easy to find.",

For example one of the donuts I tried was the snickers donut. Now that sounds like it should be wonderful however I didn't taste any hint of snickers flavor, it just tasted like a chocolate donut and a little dry too.  The staff was super friendly and helpful explaining the different flavors. But honestly if I lived in Vegas I don't know if I'd stop here again.",

I LOVE these - Mexican hot chocolate is my favorite, I don't know why it's better than the regular chocolate or the Nutella, but for me it is the best. Blood orange is good, really liked the blueberry lemon, and bc I am a health nut - the Cadbury egg inside the Easter donut.  Actually scratch all this - the Homer is the best. And the fritter. Damn, just order a dozen and wear your sweats, these donuts are amazing.  I got these for my last birthday instead of a cake.  Sent my friend down to get the Easter donuts. Came for Mother's Day... you get the picture. The location is great, you can go to the vintage stores on Main Street or walk Fremont. They have a garden, a donut aquarium, cute art on the walls, nice staff, Chef Jeff is usually there, OH, and banging coffee.   Ok one thing - they bake their masterpieces in the AM and close the store when they sell out. Run don't walk to Donut Bar, as their selection winds down as it gets closer to closing - around lunchtime",

This is one of those occasions where bigger isn't necessarily better.  We both felt that the other 2 looked more appealing but were mostly bread. I would probably go back and try the Brad Fritter w/Bacon (was told it was Brad Pitt's favorite), Blueberry Cheesecake and the Nutella Filled powder donut. The donuts were all fresh, as well!",

We ordered the oh-my-bday-cake-Oreo, blueberry cheesecake, blueberry with Meyer lemon, toasted coconut, birthday cake, and chocolate twix. My favorite (besides the donut cone with the vanilla soft serve AND chocolate sauce over the top) was the coconut and blueberry cheesecake. They were all good but seriously, I could not get over that darn churro cone! WITH SOFT SERVE! MY FAVORITE! I love soft serve ice cream! And to put it in a churro donut cone is freaking geeeenius!   We went back a few days a later but went too late! I seriously almost cried when I saw the sold out on the window!!   This is a DEFINITE stop if you're just visiting Vegas or if you live in Vegas.

I absolutely loved the caramel latte donut, it was my favorite. The French toast donut was made to order and it was so fluffy and good. I also got the mud pie and Creme brulee donut and they were amazing as well. I wish I got to try all of the donuts but that would be too much for a small girl like me haha. I couldn't believe that their strawberry split was vegan and it was huge!! I came with my cousin's gf and sister and they're vegans and they couldn't believe it either. We were all in heaven and were in awe the whole time. The prices aren't bad either considering the amount of dough you're getting!

We had the coconut, blueberry cheesecake, creme brulee and birthday cake oreo doughnuts. First of all they were all very dry. My daughter hated the birthday cake oreo doughnut, she said it was overly sweet, even when I took out the oreo it was still very sweet. We also ordered their strawberry milk and chocolate milk. They tasted like regular milk. Going there was a mistake. About 2 hours later my daughter started getting sick, my daughter is still suffering until now. I'll take Krispy Kreme over this place anytime.",

The flavors are unique and tasty and each donut is easily the size of two. Did I mention they have a bunch of vegan donuts too (not just the plain, boring flavors)? Couldn't even tell the difference (being vegan, doesn't make me biased, I swear!).   SERVICE: Best service. Everyone was nice and was happy to chat us up. I was with my sister and it turns out two brothers were working there together. NEAT! Also, my sister didn't like the coffee drink she got so a nice woman came over to make it different so my sister could enjoy it. No extra charge and she was totally understanding.   PRICE: Who cares? Worth every penny!  OVERALL: Like I said to VegeNation a couple blocks over: I love you guys, come to LA?",

Also, i was lucky enough to get donuts because, from what ive heard, they sell out frequently.   I had a decent selection to choose from for it being midday. (One of the guys told me theres usually much more to choose from but they all sold out) i got the strawberry cheescake, peanut butter something, the elvis and an original. It was a \"meh\" for the original. The elvis was delectable, banana cream with caramel. The peanut butter was a little dry. As for the cheesecake, i cant comment because i ate it the next day.  Will definitely be going back again, mainly to try the churro-looking donut cone they have. Also, the staff was very friendly.",

    "text": "I woke up this morning... 7 AM... because I was going to go try The Donut Bar. There was so much hype about this place from USA today to the food network to Ellen. I was energized and ready to go! I got there at 7:50 in the morning and it was easy to find parking. There was already a line of at least 40 people ahead of me who were also waiting for a shop that was about to open at 8 AM. The wait time to get in once the shop opens at 8 AM was 30 minutes in line outside. Luckily, it was a pleasant day.  As I approached the inside of the store, I was surprised to see that I wasn't all that excited. I saw many very large looking donuts with hard tacky frosting that weren't at all appealing. The oversized amount made them less appealing rather than to appear yummy. The smaller donuts looked good and, by smaller, I mean normal size like Dunkin' Donuts regular donuts.  The service was just OK. Whoever chose to run this place really doesn't seem to understand what the best environment for customer service is. It was glaring super loud music over the speakers where I could barely hear the person helping me and I'm not sure if they could hear me. I had to order several donuts for a party and thought this is a good place to try because it gets so much publicity so it has to be good. I decided to put my instincts aside because so many people were waiting in front of me and behind me to get into this place and it has gotten all these reviews. As I ordered, after two dozen donuts, the server just went off to help somebody else without even asking me if I was finished with my order. I couldn't believe it! I was very friendly during the whole interaction which is why this shocked me. I did not bother calling her back because I am not confrontational and simply will let something like this go, but won't let it go during a review.  The donuts range from two dollars that are very small to some pastries that are upwards of four dollars. I ordered several donuts including the Twix, Samoa, blueberry with lemon, chai, Nutella, Red velvet, and the creme brulee. Here is what I have to say: firstly, you have to eat these donuts the day of because they are not as good the next day. With that being said, most of the donuts were not that impressive to begin with. They were just ok or disappointing. In fact, the creme brulee donut, which gets all of this amazing hype, was one of the worst ones of the bunch. The hard sugar/Caramel crust on top of the donut was so burnt that it carried a foul aftertaste. The donut itself had a yummy creme brulee center within the dough. The topping of the crunchy burnt sugar/Caramel ruined it. I also did not like that many of the donuts were grossly over sized with a great deal of tacky frosting on it which was glazed and dried off. I did order a couple of those and they were not very good. This place is OK. I did not try the coffee and I wonder if that would've changed my mind and increased their ratings. The donuts are so so. They aren't that much better than other places or don't cost a lot less so I do not know what people are talking about. Also, the wait time and price just isn't worth it. It is a very popular place and a lot of people come here. Not sure if there are people that love donuts so much that this is considered great quality??? I love food and have been very fortunate to taste some phenomenal food internationally at some of the best places. I know donuts and sadly, the donut bar does not have anywhere close to the best donuts around. The two stars are because it is expensive, the service was disappointing, the wait time to get the donuts was way too long for this,and the donuts did not impress. I am glad I tried it just take the hype away and I should have gone with my instincts.",

    "text": "Can not for the life of me figure out what the hype is all about! Disgusting abominations of sugar on top of sugar, dense bready thick, dry, stupidly huge, so called donuts.   Husband went downtown early sat to get some to try since we heard about the place being so great and that they \"sell out\". Yeah ok. All first timers or tourists and not repeat customers I'd be sure!  2 days later and they are still sitting on my counter, most untouched, after we \"tried\" a tasting of a few of them..... And I have a house full of kids, one of which is a teenage boy,  if that tells you anything! If they won't eat it you KNOW it's bad! Lol!  The cream brulee (best seller!?! Ugh!) was disgusting. Tasteless hard coating of topping that sticks in your teeth on top of basically bread with literally a teaspoon amount of supposed Bavarian creme (also not made fresh, definitely out of a can). Ick! Every one we tried had the exact same tasteless dense dense dense bread like dough. I would compare it very much like the French bread loaves you get at Walmart for $1 topped or filled with multiple variations of whatever disgusting sugar concoction you can think of. Frosting (any of them) is nothing special and entirely pointlessly overdone, tastes like store bought in the cake isle. Apple tart topped with bacon one was dry (as were all of them due to the \"bread\" dough they use). I'm not sure how in the world you can make an apple filling tasteless but they did it! Dumped straight out of a can. Super disappointed since that one looked the most promising. The pop tart one... Well that is one that is still sitting untouched on the counter. Just grossly huge, pop tart wrapped in bread, filled with some sort of sickly sweet jelly, and topped with more sugar type topping. Oh! And sprinkles! Puke! My kids wouldn't even touch it.  There is also a sponge bob one so decorated with the gross frosting that my 7 yr old didn't event attempt it.  Basically it is clear that the object of this place is to make things \"look\" interesting enough to buy but absolutely no attention to actual taste, quality or ingredients. Nothing even remotely tastes like it was hand made fresh. Everything is ingredients you can buy in the cake isle (and bread isle) at the grocery store and make yourself. Blagh!  Hey #donutbar...You can stop saying #bestdonutsintheworld now please!  My recommendation and by far superior quality, taste, freshness, service, and overall care of product is #deesdonuts on centennial and Durango! Go check them out and see the difference!",

I guess living In LA for the past four years really spoiled me because of the myriad of donut shops I've tried there. Donut bar is different from all the donut shops in Vegas I do have to say. They offer donuts the size of your face, flavor combinations that are unique, and esthetics so pretty you don't want to eat them. Unfortunately, I can't say the same about the texture. The texture was not as moist as I had anticipated. With every bite, I had to wash it down with some water. We came at noon and maybe the donuts were sitting there for a couple hours? But that should not be a valid excuse for a shop specializing in donuts. They close at 1pm or when all the donuts are sold out. Would I come here again, probably not. Sorry donut bar but you can do better.",

It was so many to choose from, I wanted them all, but definitely will be back since it's right up the street from work",

I mean, every week I got at least one donut when they were there at LVFM. It was incredibly difficult to resist.  Their shop downtown is the cutest and they  have the most delicious nitro (and regular) coffee to pair with your donut.  The employees here are sweet, patient and understanding of the tricky task of selecting the right donut - picking the right donut takes careful consideration when there's a bajillion options!   I'm vegan so I usually do the apple fritter (holy shit) or caramel brulee",

Lil Olivia said it was sweet and savory. The only thing I didn't like was that their was only about 10 chairs inside for dining. We had to go to the back patio and it was a little chilly but it would be cute if a little warmer. I am really glad I tried this spot and the prices were pretty cheap.

I purchased the French Toast Donut.. it involved a grill, came out hot and awesome.. with silverware; butter, syrup and jam on a plate.. my goodness!!!   The first and third time I went I was that around opening and it was awesome.. the second time I went I arrived around 11:00AM. (They close at 1Pm) .. at 11 they were almost sold out. That's a positive thing. This place has fresh donuts and they are delicious. So get there earyish",

    "text": "I was excited to have found this place when I went to Vegas for EDC weekend. I was actually looking for a churro place but I guess this place popped up for their cone dipped in cinnamon sugar. Even more excited that the shuttle got lost and dropped us around the corner from Donut Bar!! So why 3 stars? Let me break it down:  Ambience: 5/5. No complaints. Not the strip, and not a glamorous neighborhood, but inside is cute, the donuts all look amazing. Clean, etc. The board and menu is cute as well.   Service: 5/5. The girl who helped us out was patient. It was kind of hard being a short Asian to try to see the donuts displayed in the back and not in the counter. She was super friendly, cheery, and overall nice. Service was quick.  Layout: Definitely up with the social media trends with the hashtags and the sign so you can instagram those ginormous and beautiful looking donuts.   But the most important part is the donut itself.....  Donut/Pastries: 2.5/5. The donuts LOOK amazing. So much variety. Different sizes. Awesome flavor combinations. I bought 6 donuts. A whole box for $16. BUT the donut itself was so disappointing. The batter was dry and thick. Closer to an old-fashioned when it wasnt supposed to be. We got there right when they opened at 8am so its not stale. Its just the batter itself. All the donuts had the same batter so even if the frosting was different, the dry batter was still the same.   Creme brulee donut was one of the top ones according to yelp and the girl, but even though the filling (amount was also inconsistent since I bought two), it still didnt moisten the dry batter. However, the crunch of breaking it was satisfying.   The maple cinnamon which I figured was the closest to a churro was burnt near the top and edges but gooey in the middle. However it was too sweet. Perhaps it was the maple. I still ate 90%.   I really wanted to like this place but their actual donuts were all disappointing. Could not use the #bestdonutsintheworld. Sorry!  P.s. Apparently, the cone only is available after 10am. So I never even got what I came for. The rating is purely on the   3.5 stars rounded down to 3 as I do not think its overhyped for the donut itself. Everything was good though. Come for the novelty and not for the best donut in your life.",

My favorite thing about donut bar is their creme brulee donut with the crunchy sugar coating and the creamy custard filling. Why are they putting less coating and less filling?!   Donut bar has the most bready donuts. They are seriously just slightly sweet bread that are oversized or overly decorated. I have probably tried all of their donuts and they are just not good in my opinion.  Their donut cone with soft serve is good and their creme brulee donut used to be good.  I have probably been here six times because their instagram is popping but I have to say their donuts are just not good.",

On my first visit, I kept it simple with a chocolate donut and was not disappointed at all! My friend got the strawberry cheese cream donut and she loved it. I tried both donuts and decided that the donuts might be a little bit TOO sweet for me.. however I will be back to try more flavors!",

I was able to get a birthday cake donut on my birthday it tasted exactly like birthday cake!!! I also noticed that they have franchise options I had no idea donut bar was a franchise? Maybe one of these will pop up in California close to me soon because their donuts are fantastic!!!! They also have a large selection of drip coffee. Heather just having decaf or regular there were five options that you could choose from even in flavored coffee",

But if you're more into fluffy doughy donuts, then these are not for you.   My boyfriend and I landed in Vegas on a Saturday morning and headed straight to Donut Bar at 8am hoping for some fresh donuts. We got there around 830AM & there was no line when we walked in. The second we entered, the room filled with sweet smelling goodness.  All the donuts LOOKED AMAZING. We bought 2 dozen for our entire group of friends. So we basically tried every single Donut they had to offer. And I mean I actually tried a bite of every single one.. and I wasn't too amazed. Maybe I was just overhyped?   The price was pretty high too. The doughnuts are HUGE.. But bigger is not always better. They ranged from $2-5 depending on which flavor. We ended up spending about $75 for 2 dozen.  Most likely I would not come back here again, but it doesn't hurt to try if you're a first timer! I would definitely recommend heading to the east coast if you're on the hunt for real delicious donuts!",

I got the chocolate bacon donut bar and the \"Nutella Overload.\" It's too bad I didn't eat them right when I bought them, so as to have identified the MAJOR problem early on and confronted the shop about it, but I saved the donuts for a late afternoon treat-yo-self after some hours of blackjack. This is how it went down:  I take a few bites of the chocolate bacon...it's aight, your typical donut, definitely has its work cut out for itself to catch up to the maple bacon bar of Voodoo Donuts in Portland, OR.   Next up, I take a big bite of the Nutella Overload, expecting a blobby, sludgy Nutella infusion. Ummm, NO. It's a plain dry donut. Baffled, I take another large bite. NOTHING. I frantically rip apart this stupid donut and THERE IS NO NUTELLA WHATSOEVER IN THE DONUT, let alone an \"OVERLOAD.\"   There is not even a swipe, dab, drop, lick, or smidgeon to be seen of the signature brown chocolate hazelnut heaven paste anywhere inside of the donut. Nada, nien, niet, RIEN!   If the Nutella Overload cost $1, then I'd shrug it off. But $4 paired with deceptive advertising of \"overload\" is appalling.   Also, their hours are arbitrary and thus, suck. Just make more donuts. You're a self-proclaimed donut \"bar.\" Lastly, it's tiny on the inside and located on a nondescript street. Hardly a place that meets the expectations created by way of their larger-than-life website.   Go to Voodoo Donuts in Portland, OR or Psycho Donuts in San Jose, CA.",

But since they do change out their vegan selection you might be able to try a variety of flavors in just a few visits. The service has been great the two times I've been in. Sadly I haven't even paired a donut with a beer just yet. I'm slacking on my day drinking apparently. All the donuts look awesome and I'm sure are good. I've heard good things about the samoa Girl Scout style donut. I've had the creme brulee... I wish it had more filling. Had to eat the whole donut before finding any filling until the last  bite. I am anticipating some flavors like the spiced chai for sure. I will definitely be back and you should swing by if you haven't yet. They close at 1pm and happy hour is just before. You could score two for one!",

In the morning I was in search of an espresso that was going to be better than the free hotel coffee and a yelp search sent me here.  I walked in and the staff was super friendly and let me look in the cases and take it all in while not pressuring me to make a decision.  The strawberry short cake doughnuts looked amazing as did the one's with the pop tarts inside but, I chose a strawberry cheese cake doughnut, creme brulee doughnut and long doughnut filled with German cream.  Extremely creative doughnut flavors and combinations without being over the top and not well executed.  I headed back to the hotel and let me tell you the strawberry cheesecake doughnut only lasted for 4 bites.  My friend ate the other two and they lasted about the same and he kept saying how amazing they were.  I agreed because I had to stop myself from going back to get more for myself.  The espresso was the strongest and best that I have had in quite a few years!  I will definitely be back when I am here again in June!",

She guided us through the different options, the favorites, and her own favorites. We ended up with the Butter Beer Donut, Apple Fritter, Maple Bacon, and Creme Brule.   I personally thought these donuts were too sweet. And really not my type of donut in general. These are mostly bready donut's with super sugary, cake icing. It wasn't bad. Just not my thing. The Creme Brule was different. Creamy vanilla filling with sugar burleed to the top.   If you are big in to sugar you may love this place. I really loved the people and the experience of it all.

    "text": "This place runs out of donuts pretty quick. We went in around maybe 11 AM and most of the donuts or kind of gone they only had a few flavors. I took some of the last ones of certain flavors. There was this really good looking doughnut and Lady right in front of me ordered it. After I placed my order a tour guide brought a whole bunch of people.   I love the donut but I got it was this huge donut I don't remember the name of it but it was like caramel with chocolate. I didn't get any of their drinks just donuts. Next time I'm in Vegas I will make sure to wake up early and come.  Oh and I also got the creme brulee donut that everyone is always raving about. I personally didn't really like it because of the hardshell. I like my donuts to be soft and it was pretty cool to crack it and the cream tasted super good but it's just not for me.",

Our donuts, coffee and chocolate milk were all great. I was very impressed with their HUGE selection of donuts. I had a difficult time just picking half a dozen.   You have to checkout their fish tank that they had made by the guys from Tanked  It looks awesome and the donuts look so real you could almost eat them.   ***** They offer a military discount *****  I believe it was 10% it might have been more but whatever the amount it is great when business offer something to say thank you.",

OMG! This place is awesome, I've never seen so many kinds of donuts, they have a huge variety and I've been told they always change the flavors!!! My favorite ones were French toast and creme brulee. But I recommend trying all of them! You won't get tired, they are not \"too\" sweet. The place is clean, very organized, service is great. Even though there are a lot of people, you won't be waiting in line for too long, they are fast! If you want to eat there and you don't find a place inside the restaurant, they have a great patio with chairs and tables outside.  You have to try these donuts! You won't regret it, they have great coffee too!",

If your website says you close at 1pm you should make enough donuts to be open till that time....especially on Valentine's Day when you know ppl probably give them as gifts! Paid for parking too only to walk over and find that they wrote on the window that they were sold out and it's only 11:30am! It was dark inside so I'm sure they just didn't run out! Bad customer service and bad planning on owners part! I don't care if you have 4.5 stars on Yelp if your customer service sucks! Won't return! Don't care how good the donuts are!",

Then why am I lukewarm about it?  Part of the problem is that they are all looks and less about substance. The donuts are okay, just okay. The yeast donuts are big and fluffy, but they lack flavor. For instance their birthday cake donut looks pretty but it just tastes like a donut - there's nothing to suggest it tastes like birthday cake. No icing, no batter, none of that 'eggy' flavor. All the other yeast donuts were similar. The cake donuts are a better bet, but I only had one of those, so maybe I bet on the wrong horse so to speak.  It's worth a try, but it's not the best donuts you'll ever have. I would suggest sticking to cake donuts if you do come here.",

They only frost the top then it's a plain donut under which is great for balancing out the sweetness of the frosting.   I feel like the price was fair for the size donut you get. All specialty donuts as well. A lot of flavors to choose from!  The staff was nice & welcoming even told us where more seating was located. They made suggestions on which donuts were most popular & gave us adequate time to make a decision.   The overall environment was clean, cute & artsy. This location was quiet & away from the crowd which was nice.   They had outdoor seating in a little shaded courtyard which was great.   If I'm ever in the area again, I'd check them out.",

    "text": "I really wanted to love this place but, alas, I did not. We make it a point to seek out \"gourmet\" doughnut shops on our vacations so I was looking forward to this one.   For starters, most of the doughnuts are huge. While normally that might be a selling point, it's a bummer when you'd like to try multiple flavors. I chose the Harry Potter-themed butterbeer (butterscotch) and it was very cute but the flavor was very eh. I was expecting a filling but realized that they had simply covered the center hole with a squirt of icing and the icing alone wasn't really enough for the intended flavor to come through at all. My husband got the strawberry and whipped cream filled doughnut. It was ok, but the \"whipped cream\" definitely wasn't dairy based and felt kinda plastic-y in your mouth.  Secondly, because they are so large, the prices are a little hefty. We paid $10 for two donuts and a black coffee. I have no problem paying for good food but the lackluster flavor made the price point not worth it.  Everything was very visually attractive and the shop was cute.  Overall, I might have had a better experience if we had picked different flavors but what we had wasn't worth the money or the drive. Such a shame because the shop was fun and the staff was very friendly.",

    "text": "Finally made it here after several attempts. Always too early on the weekend, so we hit other donut shops that open early mornings on weekends we are up and about with sunrise. This place opens 9 am on weekends!  So the donuts look appealing, several large donuts, glazed, chocolate, Nutella. These are twice the size of regular donuts. Today, the large glazed was a little under cooked for me. It was doughy, when pulling apart, the pieces could be rolled into an almost raw like consistency. I don't care for that.   The old fashion was too dried out, dry and stale. They pulled it from a large tray but I don't know how long they where sitting out, but just to dry for me.   Got two of the cream brulee, good donut with hard glaze on top stuffed with cream filling. Tasted like vanilla pudding instead of real cream. Not bad for what it was.   Next thing that we tried was the Boston cream bars. They where good, love the chocolate glaze, again the vanilla pudding cream taste and not truly the real cream flavor.   I am not thinking it was a great choice today. Not completely opposed to trying again, but was not terribly impressed.",

    "text": "Their coffee was good and their simple creme brulee donut @ $2 was a decent introduction to this place.  I walked in on a Saturday morning to find the place alive and buzzing with several excited families seeking donuts for breakfast.  Their regular donut options seemed overwhelmingly huge for $5/piece so when I asked them for their smallest donut they pointed me over to the creme brulee near the end.    Americano took a few mins but was delicious and complex.  The creme brulee was yummy with a sugar topping that shatters when you bite into it and that custard that's to die for.  Worth the random wander off the downtown area but others may find the area too quiet for their own comfort on an early Saturday morning in Feb.  Bonus: the driverless shuttle they are piloting has the Donut Bar as a stop!",

We filled the entire box up with whatever donuts we wanted, and it was amazing that they still had the poppa tart donut which I wanted to try. I took a giant bite out of it, and it was so yummy! It would've been better if I heated it and the glaze was melty and warm. I recommend heating it up though. Overall, I loved the strawberry pop tart donut even though it was so big I couldn't finish it and only ate a quarter and saved the rest for later! It was delicious and I would definitely eat it again.",

    "text": "Donut Kill My Vibe!! This is a cute, small and fun donut bar! It's been in my bookmarked list for the next time I came to Vegas, and I finally got to try them. When you walk in the aroma of fresh donuts hits you in the face. It's also super cute and colorful. I love that you could see all the donuts on display as well as the colors of the place. It's very warm and welcoming. The staff is also extremely nice and patient. I say patient because I was so eager to get inside and take pictures and create a video. Haha. However as far as taste, their donuts are pretty average.   They have tons of donuts to choose from but we ended up getting the Big Poppa Tart Donut, Strawberry Filled Donut, and they gave us a free candy cane donut because we had our 14 month old daughter with us. How cool is that?! Very nice and thoughtful. I have never had a donut place offer a free kids donut. However, I will say their donuts are a little more on the expensive side, but most are bigger than your average donut so it balances out.   The Big Poppa Tart was definitely big and enough to share. I got the Strawberry one. It's made to look like an oversized Pop-tart. The cool thing is, there is an entire pop tart on the inside of the Big Poppa Tart. The donut itself was very good and tender. It also tasted amazing with the strawberry jam on top. Now I will be honest and say I didn't care much for the Pop-tart on the inside. It was chewy and a little stale tasting as far as texture. It didn't taste like a regular Pop-Tart. I guess something changes as the donut is heated and fried. Overall, the Big Poppa Tart is pretty and the edges taste really good. My husband ate my entire half of my Big Poppa and he never said a thing about the Pop-Tart so I guess it didn't bother him. He just said he couldn't taste it. *Shrugs* I guess it's more of a personal preference.  The Strawberry Filled tasted pretty good. I didn't get to taste it because my husband killed it but overall it was good he said. He said it honestly didn't taste like anything special or different than any other Strawberry Filled Donut he has had. I will say this is one of their smaller donuts. If you order a circular shaped donut then these are the bigger ones.  I also didn't taste my daughter's donut but my husband did. He said it tasted like a regular donut. I guess she liked it because she ate it all. It was just a donut in the shape of a candy cane with white and red glaze on top.   Overall, Donut Bar was cute and fun! As far as taste, I don't think they were anything special. They were pretty average. I will say their creativity of their donuts and some of the flavors is unique but other than that they taste just like any other donut shop.",

    "text": "Good donuts, damn good donuts.  What else is there to know?  Ah... if you insist...  So I guess this place is famous.  I didn't know, I just came downtown to pay a ticket and saw a neat little sign for a donut shop.  Inside I go and I'm just blown away by the different types of donuts on display!  Homer's donut?  Matcha donut?  Nutella donut?  What!?  Which should I try?  The answer is ALL OF THEM!  Haha okay not really, but I did buy a dozen.  The french toast donut was my favorite.  I believe they make it on request because mine came out hot, and I did have to wait additional time for it.  It comes with syrup on the side as well.  My only regret is not buying two!  It was that good.  I loved Homer's donut as well.  I believe that was strawberry flavored icing on top?  It was simple, but great.  The strawberry split was SO good!  My partner loved how it wasn't too sweet, and loved having creme and strawberries in the donut.    I didn't order the creme brulee donut this time, but I hear it's their signature donut.  Heck, they all look and taste like signature donuts!  Instead of cooking breakfast I think I'll just order a french toast donut from here instead.  It was bigger than all the donuts and very filling.    They close when they're out of donuts and trust me, they will run out.  I recommend arriving early as there's usually no line.  Definitely a must try when you're in Las Vegas!  PROTIP:  Their menu changes DAILY!  You can also order in advance on their website only during THE DAY BEFORE!  And it has to be a dozen donuts, minimum.  I believe the deadline is 6pm, but I could be mistaken.  This saves a lot of time during busy weeks if there's a festival going on in the city.",

And for those of you who don't know what I'm talking about, go Google the creme brulee donut now and watch a video of it in action. It's just one those things where words won't do it justice.   The thing about Donut Bar is that it is open until the store runs out of donuts. Therefore, I recommend getting there when it opens or going on a weekday. My friends and I got there on a Tuesday morning around 10am, and there wasn't a line. The best part was that there was a ton of creme brulee donuts available!  We tried the pistachio lemon, maple bacon, strawberries & cream, and the creme brulee donuts. Out of everything I tried, the creme brulee is my favorite. The sugar coating is thick and tough, making it impossible to 'crack' with a plastic spoon. The cream filling inside is not too sweet and delicious. The other donuts are the cake kind, which is not my favorite. They're good -- a solid 4 where the creme brulee is a 4.5",

    "text": "I was very disappointed with this place. I was happy to find out that they had vegan donuts, but the quality of the donuts were sub par at best. I got there around 2:30pm just as they were closing, so they were selling the donuts for $10 per box. I thought it was a good deal until I actually tried the donuts. They were awful. I tried all of the vegan donuts that they had left. Apple fritter, salted caramel, Creme brulee, and peanut butter and jelly. They were all hard and stale. The apple fritter was burnt on the bottom.  The top of the Creme brulee was like a hard piece of plastic. I was shocked at how bad the product was, especially since they are surrounded by so many great eateries in the area. They should be embarrassed selling that kind of garbage, even if it is closing time.  I definitely do not recommend this place.",

Note that they may not offer the grilled cheese and french toast donuts every day though.   Having been to the Donut Bar in San Diego, I can say the Las Vegas location is definitely bigger and less crowded (at least on a Saturday morning, though I guess it's off season for Vegas right now).   I'd say it's most worth to come here if you're excited to try their unique flavors. Blood orange, birthday cake oreo, and the blueberry cheesecake are delicious and not too sweet actually! Also, if you buy a dozen, you get one donut free. We ended up spending $29 (including tax) for three big donuts and 10 small ones, which runs a bit pricey but I'd argue it's worth it especially if you're splitting donuts. The big donuts are gigantic anyways and are (more than) worth the $3.   Service is friendly and location is hard to miss (with a big donut painted on the outside of the building).",

Easy to get around for pedestrians but it's sort of like walking thru a zombie minefield of people asking for money, people talking to themselves or wondering if you're going to get mugged right around the corner. Yeah, not pretty. Perseverance is the key.  My main tip for you is Donut Bar's storefront is actually on Carson Avenue & not on 6th Street.  I planned on getting 2 donuts but everything looked so alluring I settled for 3 & dealt with the consequences later. This was my breakfast & snack for later.  Hmm. Taste was okay. For me it was very sweet but the aim to a donut's success is the texture of the dough & unfortunately all 3 of my choices were on the dry side. Maybe it was an off day? Because look at all the 4-5 Star reviews here. I am like, huh? I dunno.  Creme Brulee Donut - Their specialty. The hard, crunchy brulee'd exterior sticks to your teeth. The creme inside was good.   Blueberry Cheesecake Donut-Yeast donut with comstock blueberry filling & iced cream cheese frosting was very sweet & not very cheesecake-like.  Oreo Birthday Cake Donut- Yeast donut stuffed with an Oreo cookie inside. Although the Oreo was soggy if I had to choose, I liked this donut out of my 3 picks.  I was also bummed to see they no longer had the cartons of Stump Town coffee and only a bottled version of cold brew which brought my bummer level down further.  In my eyes I prefer Mr. Donut & Donut King so for Oahuans don't fret too much if you can't get to Donut Bar on your next trip to the 9th Island. You have very good options at home.",

It was still delightful to me, but I'm sure it would've tasted even better if I ate it fresh. For $2 per donut, this place wins my heart! Not a bad drive from the strip either :)",

I regret that I didn't check out the online menu to see what types they had before going there. So it was a bit over-whelming trying to view/choose what to order because the line moved too quickly. I tried the lemon cake donut drizzled with a cream cheese frosting glaze & took back a huge blueberry glazed donut (I forget what there  actual names are). If that wasn't enough, I was fortunate enough to try the Homer Simpson pink donut w/ sprinkles (they always sell out, so go early). Well...they were all wonderfully delicious. But, I'm glad they are not located close to where I reside otherwise, I would be there at least once a week & that wouldn't be good for my waist line (yikes). Yet, I do think about & crave those fried desserts since I've tasted them!!",

A few of the donuts we purchased tasted good but most of them were greasy and tasted like they were made the day before. We did purchase a couple of the big donuts, but really not worth the price. Should have a price for a dozen with specialty add ons. Probably won't visit again, not so much the cost but the quality.",

I told them I wanted one of those, and one of the Homer Simpson inspired donuts.  The server placed two birthday cake donuts in my box, instead of one, as a special treat as it was opening week, along with the Homer donut.  When I told her it was also my birthday and that it was really cool, she put another donut in there!   I've been back several times, and still haven't gotten any other free donuts; however, let me just say, I've encountered the same friendly service!  Consider trying the chocolate milk or coffee on tap, and be sure to use the restroom, well, at least look in the restroom before leaving.  The restaurant itself is quite small, so please be sure to explore the courtyard area for more seating that is particularly nice on Spring and Summer mornings.",

The donuts were huge and cooked like remember they were 35 years ago back in the dinosaur era. My choices were an apple bacon fritter and a maple bacon log! I don't care what my wife and mother in law got, I had bacon in front of me! They said, \" it was good they'd come back and tell others\". I had their coffee and yes!, they'll make you what that startakeyurbucks place can make I believe I like this place better. Place is located downtown Vegas and the area is really becoming a great place geared towards us locals and giving us the non-commercial franchise associated crap local Las vegans are looking for!  Great little place! Big do-NUTS! Better caffeine beverages than StraveYourBucks!",

The store variety: smores, Oreo birthday cake, crime brulee, and etc. The donut price ranges from $2-$5 but the $4-$5 donuts are huge!   You have to get to the store before 10 am, preferably 8-9:20 am or else most of the popular donuts will be sold out. You can preorder online and pick it up from 8-10 am but the minimum is 12 donuts.   Easily my favorite donut store when I'm in Las Vegas or San Diego.",

There was such a variety of uncommon donut flavors (Nutella, mud pie, strawberry cheesecake, Homer Simpson) and the donuts were huge! I asked the guy at the counter for a recommendation, since there were so many choices, and he said to try the French toast donut. So I ordered and when it came out, it was a huge donut with butter, syrup, and blueberry compote on the side. I took the first bite with butter and dipped in syrup and I think the sky parted and  I heard angels singing!!! The lightest French toast ever!!! What a combo! My girlfriend had the strawberry cheesecake and said it was amazing! We will be back here the next time we are in Vegas. They only served this donut Sat and Sun, from what the guy said, so if you have a cheat meal and in Vegas for a weekend, this is the meal to have.   It's right down the street from the Mob Museum, which was also a great place to visit after having a foodgasm.",

We decided today, on our last day in Vegas to show up right at opening (Thursday btw) we showed up at 6:55 am, we were the 2nd person waiting for them to open (Yes, waiting) the lady in front of us drive from an hour away for a donut for her boyfriend who's bday was today. Before we knew it, 3 more people behind us BEFORE opening. The people behind us also raved about this place. We purchased 3 Triple Chocolate, 2 Cinnamon Sugar Donuts with Whip Topping and FRESH Strawberries, a Strawberry Cheesecake and I personally tried at least a bite of each flavor & loved them all. We also purchased a Homer donut, which I didn't try and was told it was a little dry..but it's not my cup of tea anyway..lol. My husband tried an Apple fritter which he loved so much that he texted me while at work to let me know he loved it. I have a nutella donut saved for tomorrow's breakfast and can't wait!! I was told that they do not make the same flavors daily,  which is pretty cool and probably a bummer at the same time..but definitely a good reason to come early!! The lady behind the counter was friendly and knowledgeable, quick and patient with us indecisive customers which was greatly appreciated. I had been recommended the Horchata donut but was told they only make those at the San Diego location. Sounds like I'll have to make a trip, lol. But...will definitely be back to this location since Vegas is our home away from home!!",

    "text": "Love this place. They have THE most amazing donuts. Their staff is very friendly, and everything is reasonably priced. Get there early because they close when they are sold out of the daily batch of donuts already made. With each donut purchased, (at least for my kids) you get another free large sized donut in your box. So cool. My kids loved this place. We got the Double Chocolate Donut and the Birthday Cake Donut, pictured with this review, along with our two freebies. Oh, and they also hand out balloons for the kids!! They have some seating inside, but most is outside in the back of the bar. Such a great place. I highly recommend.",

Dough has a good balance of fluffy, bready and chewy, these are just bready. TBH they kinda taste grocery store esque with more unique flavors (not that grocery store donuts are all that bad...just \"standard\") I've tried a lot of donuts ever since moving to Las Vegas and so far these have been at the bottom of the list...I'd rather wait for the red sign to go on at Krispy Kreme. Again they're not bad, they're cute but not up to the hype that people have been reviewing or talking about. Is it bc they're downtown in the \"cool hipster area?\" I say hit up Glaze at S. Fort Apache in SW",

We came here when they first opened and I thought \"They don't have their temperatures/ measurements converted to the altitude of Vegas\" as they're a shop based out of San Diego if I'm remembering correctly.   If you order a plain donut that's not filled or stuffed with a cookie, they're all dry :(. The worst part is that they're so expensive. A single plain donut is $2. Anywhere else a single glazed donut is .99 cents or less. They only get more expensive the more \"creative\" they get. The French toast donut is really good but doesn't need the syrup or extra blueberry topping since the donut is already covered in powdered sugar AND glaze. When you're feeling extra gluttonous I think it hits the spot. The only other saving grace is their hazelnut Kona coffee which I think I found the same one online so I can save myself the trip, parking meter fee, and disappointment of dry donuts.",

Only got a few..  their creek brulee is a signature item. Hard crispy sugar shell. Yeast insides with custard filling. Looked good.   I had the strawberry pop tart which has an actual pop tart inside. Yeast around the pop tart. It was good but not the best ever. A bit dry. This put them on the map.   Had the Meyer lemon blueberry cake donut. Wow!  It was delicious. I could've eaten maybe 5. Crispy edges. Moist and soft inside. Bursting with blueberry flavor in the cake. Nice lemon flavor icing.    Not too sweet. I would get again if in walking distance.   It's a bit overwhelming as there are so many options and I wanted to try so many.   Also got a Hawaiian coffee and it was very tasty. Staff was very friendly.   Recommend if you are a donut fan.",

The filling inside was really good, however the donut itself was a little dry. The strawberry cheesecake had an ample amt of filling but the dough was also dry. Onto the reason I came here...the cone isn't really a donut. It's more like a pastry covered in sugar. The soft serve was good, but for $6, would I get it again? No",

I love that they have vegan options! I've tried The Big Poppa and Strawberry Split, which are raved about via social media and they aren't bad but elaborate donuts just aren't my thing. So maybe I'm writing this review from a sort of biased stand point.  Customer service is on point! Always. Any time, any day. Chef Jeff is fantastic and I love that he is so involved! You can see him here as soon as they open and even during the last few minutes before they close. That speaks volumes to me.  The one thing holding me back from giving it a 5 star review is the texture. They are more bread-like in texture and taste vs a traditional donut. When I think of a donut, I think of an almost fluffy, light, fried piece of heaven. It's not heavy (unless it's a cake donut, which in that case.. YUM) but it's not airy either. Am I making any sense? I hope so.   That being said, as aforementioned, I have been a repeat customer and will continue to do so in the future. I have a few more vegan ones to try. Love that their menu changes daily and that they post it on Instagram!",

Take note that the donut selection runs outside of the case. There are layers of trays behind you ready to be eaten and don't forget to look at their menu board.   The Oreo Birthday Cake has been my favorite so far. There is a full Oreo inside. I mean, don't. Who doesn't love Oreos?? You also can't go wrong with the classic maple. It's a must for me.   The selection here is fierce. So many donuts to try, so little time. Stop by the donut fish tank and snap a photo. Grab a cup of Cold Brew and go (do)nuts!",

I've been to the donut bar in SD on a weekday morning when they had more selection, but this time i still got to try some donuts I wanted to try.   We ended up with about 15 donuts, including the lemon blueberry (delicious ), a massive strawberry sugar whipped cream, strawberry pop tart donut, creme Brulee, chocolate buttermilk bar, and chocolate bacon.   Check in gets you a free drip coffee or espresso !!   The staff here is super friendly and welcoming, and I would definitely come again because they have lots of different flavors to try and it never gets boring.",

So I finally got up early enough to make it down and I am truly glad I did. I got the funfetti and vanilla bean donut and I have truly never had donuts so good and moist in my life. Not to mention those donuts plus the orange juice I got came to a total of $8.00 even. I was more than happy with the customer service from the waitress in my pictures and it was also very pleasant seeing the owner of the shop. I love being able to see owners actually come around to their shop, it provides an extra sense of intimacy in the shop that you do not typically get otherwise. I loved the Donutwill definitely be back!",

So when I discovered this sweet, sweet little gem of a donut shop in old downtown Las Vegas, I knew this was one vice I could not resist. But be warned, if you do not come to the Donut Bar before noon, chances are they will be sold out for the day. And trust me, they sell out fast. This place was so good, I had to come twice in two days to try more flavors of their donuts.  On my first visit, I ordered the strawberry cream cheese donut and a blueberry donut with Meyer lemon frosting. The donuts were dense but not overwhelmingly so. The strawberry cream cheese was a little too sweet for my liking but had good strawberry flavor throughout the frosting and the donut. The blueberry donut with Meyer lemon frosting was delicious. The flavors were simple but spot on.  On my second visit, I opted for the salted caramel donut and the Apple crumb donut. The salted caramel was by far my favorite (that I've tried so far). The Apple crumb was tasty with good apple flavor throughout but a little too heavy for my liking.   They have so many flavors to choose from and their flavors appear to rotate almost daily. But like the saying goes, \"the early bird gets the worm\". Don't be the bird that misses out on these amazing donuts.",

They offer 5 rotating vegan options, but the best part is their #1 best selling donut, the Creme Brulee is fully vegan, and no one ever knows.  For my kids, not vegan I bring home the classic Oreo birthday cake donut. It's a donut with an Oreo inside, cake frosting, and sprinkles. My dairy eating friends tell me it's heaven. The strawberry shortcake donut is best eaten with two hands. No knife or fork needed, pick that bad boy up and dive in. These are serious donuts meant to be eaten with gusto. The creme brulee top will crack when you bite into it, giving your mouth a journey between soft dough, creamy vanilla bean pudding type filling, and a crunchy candy shell. It's phenomenal.",

I walked in and was greeted by a super friendly staff. Everyone was so nice and welcoming. My friend was there waiting with a vegan green matcha tea doughnut, a creme brulee, and a apple fritter. We headed outside to the court yard and went to town.   The apple fritter was the best donut I've ever eaten. It was crispy on the outside and soft and warm on the inside. There was real apples scattered throughout the donut. The green matcha tea was a delicious cake donut that wasn't overly sweet and had orange zest. It was delicious. The creme brulee was soft and oozed out a delicious and thick creme. I was thoroughly impressed... in fact... it was happy hour when we were done so I got an entire variety box for 5 dollars and gave them to my family and friends.   This is definitely my new favorite donut place. I can't wait to come back and try more of their vegan options!",

I love the large backyard- a rarity for downtown businesses where I relax w my Vesta coffee or milk.   Creme brulee and strawberry split are also inventive and vegan too.

And I'm like damn it!  LoL.   I finally caught them with a few donuts left.  I got the Mexican chocolate donut with some milk.  This thing was huge!  Took one bite and understood why they sell out so fast.  Best donuts ever! It reminds me of donuts you get at the bakery in Hawaii.  Not too sweet and the donut is perfect not too heavy but just right.  The chocolate was delicious and the hind of cinnamon on one side and marshmallows on the other side was super yum and cute.   I need to make it here early to see what else they had.  I was eyeing out their filled nutella donut.  That is definitely on the list!",

    "text": "So excited to finally check this place out and it didn't disappoint. Between four of us we shared several donuts and highly recommend doing that so you can try a little, or in the case of the Big Poppa Tart, a lot, of each. We also had the Creme Brulee which was excellent and the crunch of the sugar topping added a unique texture to the cream filled donut. A must try when visiting. Other donuts we had were the Apple Crumb Cake, Strawberry Shortcake, Boston Cream, and the Nutella overload. Every donut was made really well and unlike some donut shops we've been to, these weren't overly sweet or too rich. They were a perfect balance with the dough itself being fluffy and light. As far as decor there is a nice and quite fitting tribute to Homer Simpson around and if he were to try Donut Bar he'd definitely approve! I would say the one downside of this location is just the location itself and size. It's towards downtown so you need to take lyft/uber/taxi if visiting from out of town and staying on the strip. The shop itself has an incredible display for all their donuts but since it's a small building only has bar stool seating for about 8-10 people. We lucked out and had enough seating but I imagine due to the popularity of these donuts there may be times where they don't have enough space for groups to sit together. A great donut shop overall and when in Sin City worth making the trip out to downtown for.",

Well this morning, I was determined to make it happen. Since its recent opening downtown, I had no excuses to push this aside; Get out of bed and get those darn donuts before they sell out...AGAIN!  Me + 2, 8am, slightly raining and a line out the door, I seriously couldn't have been more excited. The line of people were also in a good mood which made the wait pleasant. Standing in the rain, 1/2 awake, and before coffee!?? I could've cared less, especially because my experience was great.  Once in the door, the menu was pleasingly overwhelming, incredibly creative options, and Vegan options as well. We got the creme brulee, Strawberry Split, French Toast, and the Maple Bacon Cinnamon Rolls.  To the staff: You are epic!! The upbeat attitude, smiles all around, and patience during your power hours are much appreciated. It felt like we were being hosted in your home AND that we were the only customers there during our order. You unexpectedly exceeded my expectations with your service and good vibes",

It was almost closing time so only a limited donuts were available. They were so excited and welcoming from the minute I walked in that I wanted to buy a shirt from them. They invited me to look them on social medias and return the next morning for a better selection. It's not too far from Fremont Experience. The whole staff is very humble and knowledgeable. Don't wait till last minute to \"stop by\".",

I came in around 11 am during their soft opening.  There was a short line that moved quick.  I was getting donuts for a few people so picked a good variety: Caramelized Pineapple, Caramel Latte, Cake Batter, Mud Pie, Red Velvet, Samoa, Chocolate Twix, Blueberry Cheesecake, Banana Caramel and Apple Fritter.  Half went to work with Hubby and half came home with me.  It is hard to pick a favorite but if pressed I would say the Caramel Latte and Samoa were the faves out of the ones I tried.    They post the next days flavors the night before on social media.  Check it out before you go so you have an idea of what you want.  They are listed in store too but the line moves quick so be ready.  Not all of the varieties fit on the counter so don't miss a flavor because you didn't read the list.    Don't forget a drink.  They have Stumptown Cold Brew, Nitro, Chocolate and Strawberry Milk on tap.  See you in line.",

    "text": "Easiest 5 stars EVER.   First of all it's donuts so thats an easy 4 stars just for existing. The location is a bit tucked away which adds to the mystique of this dynamic donut experience. If you're staying in the downtown area and you have a free morning forget cheap steak and eggs. Bloody Mary's can wait... and a breakfast buffet is usually disgusting. These gourmet donuts will change the way you look at this breakfast novelty forever.  Anything with bacon comes with REAL bacon. Not those stingy little crumbles at other places. This bacon was thick cut, maple cured, and had a crunch that sticks to your jaws. EVERY SINGLE FLAVOR POPPED! The glazes are delicious and leave you with an angel like after taste.   I suggest looking at the pictures. Try not to drop your phone with amazement. Yes the presentation is an important part of a business like this. The passerbys or window shoppers will NEVER be disappointed walking into this business. These oversized breakfast treats are worth every penny.   Here's a few suggestions - Creme Brulee ( it cracks when you bite into it) - Brad Fritter ( its an apple fritter covered in caramel drizzle and a mountain of THICK cut bacon) - The Homer ( its a giant donut just like the one from the Simpson's) - Chai Latte ( it was like sipping on a cloud)  5th star factor for me was easily the mountain of bacon I received on top of my donut. It was definitely more then the 2 strips of loneliness you get at a Denny's or any other morning diner. The service was excellent, but damnit the bacon was over the top.",

    "text": "So after the amazing opportunity to eat these donuts at an elite event, I wanted to come by and see the selection in person.  Early on a weekday, I stopped off and picked up 6 donuts for the secretary and I to share.    This donut shop is gourmet and heightened flavors.  When I brought home the extra donuts for the hubby and kids, they generally ignored them.  I was disappointed, but the hubby said that the flavors were outside of the kids wheelhouse.    I know that the place has kid friendly options on the weekend and the chocolate milk on draft will draw my little one in.  So, maybe, I need to bring them in and let them pick their own flavor options.  Here's what we tried.  The dipped old fashion was eh.  The Pop Tart was amaze-balls.  Coworker and I took turns with the plastic knife as we cut off sections.  The jelly inside is tasty.  The frosting is perfect and not too much.  The bacon on top of the Brad fritter should just be served by itself.  I wanted to eat it all.  Coworker told me to, as she like the fritter, but the bacon was a bit off putting for her.  She had the blueberry cheesecake; didn't share.  Split the creme brulee.  The cracked sugar top is interesting.  The star of the show, in my opinion, is the creme filling.  Looking for a weekend to go back.  I hear the trick is to get there early, as they sell out of flavors.",

I'm a cake donut kind of girl We ordered lemon blueberry, old fashioned chocolate glaze, old fashioned vanilla glaze, Nutella, Boston cream, and yeast chocolate glaze. Most of the cake donuts were dry on the inside and oily on the outside. The chocolate glaze was not sweet enough, even paired with sweetness of donut, and was akin to eating an unsweetened chocolate bar. Not my style.  I would say go here if you're from a place with no fancy donuts. They are better than Dunkin donuts, but that standard isn't very high.",

I wish they would stay open longer and make more donuts.",

They didn't taste very fresh on the morning (10am) I was there and I feel like doughnuts should always taste fresh before lunchtime. They're not the worst doughnuts I've ever had but aren't worth their price tag and isn't worth a special trip. I've had far better doughnuts in Las Vegas like Real Doughnuts (on Charleston) and Ron's (on Spring Mountain).",

We stopped in around 10am and the sweet counter girl said they sold out of a lot of flavors, honestly, you wouldn't even have noticed bc it was still jam packed with Doughnuts.  I decided with the Nutella Doughnut and lemme say this.. every pastry I've had for the last 30 years on this green Earth tasted like trash compared to this.   It just melted in your mouth and the fricken thing was huge for only $3. Definitely a highlight on our trip.",

    "text": "Short Review:   Donut Bar originated in San Diego and places an emphasis on fresh, tasty, picture worthy, and creative donuts.  If a caked donut full of sugar is your thing, then give Donut Bar a try.  Donut Bar is considered one the best and their customer service is excellent.  Just be early because these donuts sell out fast.   Longer Review:   I remember the excitement when Donut Bar opened in Las Vegas.  I'm not going to lie.  I wasn't that excited when I heard the news. I didn't bookmark this place and had the opinion that Donut Bar was just hype. I'm originally from the 619 and remember when the first Donut Bar opened their doors in Daygo. I was one of those people that waited in line. The owner of that location was pretty cool and would walk by the line with full sized donut samples to patrons waiting to get in. Originally, I wasn't a fan.  I had a few failed visits because their donuts were either out or I got something that was too sweet.  I always picked a donut that just didn't \"wow\" me. I am also not into a cake donut with a bunch of sugar on it. I'm really boring when it comes to my donuts. I prefer a chocolate glazed raised donut, maple bar, cruller, or an apple fritter.  That's all I really need or want when I'm in a donut shop.  But when the girlfriend loves donuts, then you support her by eating donuts.  I have been here a couple of times since grand opening week.  I've tried the Samoa, The French Toast, Cake Batter, Caramel Latte, the Big Poppa Tart, Creme Brulee, Matcha Cake, PB&J, and of course, the Homer. Their originality, freshness, and consistency stands out.  I haven't had anything here that was too oily and greasy.  Again, these donuts really do not appeal to me and in my opinion, just too sweet. But then I had their Caramel Latte.  This donut is perfectly glazed with their latte flavor.  Then a little whipped cream and caramel is added. Because this donut is large, the glaze and toppings do not give it that overly sweet taste.  The texture is also perfect and not dry at all. This donut with a cup of their hot coffee equals perfection.  I will cheat on my chocolate raised donut any day for their Caramel Latte.  This donut alone made me a fan.   2017 Yelp Review #77",

I will say it's aggressively priced, which is understandable seeing as how they load up most of their doughnuts, but when you're just wanting a good old fashioned or a buttermilk bar, maybe not the best fir what you're paying. Their doughnuts run basically double what any other doughnut shop in town runs.",

I'll say that they're right, after visiting them for the first time, trying their donuts (multiple kinds) and a shot of their Espresso. Better than Voodoo Donuts! Why do I say that?   1. The recipes are fresh and homemade. I can taste it. No pre-made dough, no dough conditioners. Just pure, tasty donuts. Yum.  2. Great customer service. I didn't catch the name of the person who assisted me, served my donuts and pulled my espresso shot, but she was so friendly and peppy and happy and that was such a good espresso shot.  3. That was a really good espresso shot.  I'll be back. Five Stars.",

We did order online, got a confirmation email & then when we showed up they never received our order. We ordered 20 donuts online for us and friends, so I couldn't remember all the exact donuts. I ordered what I did remember and the girl that helped us was extremely sweet and threw in some extra donuts for the inconvenience, which we appreciated.   As for the donuts, they were all just standard donuts. The only amazing donut was the pop tart donut. It was incredible & totally lived up to the hype!! Our creme brulee donuts were soggy on the bottom and the dough tasted like burnt oil. The raspberry cheesecake didn't taste like raspberry cheesecake at all. The lemon blueberry was decent. The original donuts were good but nothing special.   Overall I was just hoping for amazing donuts but they were all subpar. Minus the poptart donut, everything was okay. I've had better donuts at places like Donut Mania or Fractured Prune.",

It's all about the Instagram-worthy photo opportunities. If that's your thing, along with jumping on an undeserved hype bandwagon, you'll love it. If you enjoy donuts for taste and nostalgia, then graded meh+. Continuing the trend of designer donuts, DB rolled on to the scene in 2016. Since then, there's been a dedicated following. They will tell you as much on their website, which is a paragraph or two of self back-patting about celebrities and high-profile mentions.   People love it!  I like it.  When people who haven't been ask about it, I reply, \"it's fine.\"  What has me unimpressed can be boiled down to one word: frantic. -- Parking is abysmal thanks to the location. It often can't be found or you're charged for a 15minute run-in to grab a box. -- On multiple occasions when I was first trying to check them out, they were sold out before noon. Set yourself up for disappointment before you even arrive. Donuts are a morning treat, a routine, a comfort food item. I've never experienced a donut shop that has as part of its marketing that, \"hey! we're soooo popular, we run out of our own product before it's even time for lunch, so get on down and fight for a parking spot and a donut. Whee!\"  -- The inside is decorated trendy pop pop fun fun, part of the whole experience. But the space inside is cramped, uncomfortable. You walk in and your back is against the wall in a tight funnel herding you towards ordering, which makes everything feel urgent urgent urgent. HURRY.   Claustrophobic? Go to a more spacious donut shop that doesn't run out of product, has hospitable parking, and allows you some elbow room for moving about.  I will say, though: those French toast donuts I turned my nose up at? Pretty incredible. ALMOST worth the effort to gamble on there being one available.",

    "text": "We frequent the original donut bar in San Diego so decided to stop by the one by Fremont street (downtown Las Vegas) while in town for the 4th of July. The place is pretty inconspicuous so easy to drive past, with paid parking all around, although we risked it and just parked and ran in to grab our doughnuts to go.   First thing different we noticed was that there was hardly anyone there. We arrived about 35 minutes after they opened and walked right in. Normally at the one in SD you can expect a line of 20+ people waiting before they open. Maybe we caught them at just the right time since we noticed more people start to show up as we were leaving.  The place is a bit smaller, and it seems like the selection may be smaller too. I also noticed that they don't give kids free doughnuts like they do at the one in SD. The staff were just as friendly and welcoming though, and we were not disappointed with the doughnuts we picked, just as delicious!  If you're staying in downtown or have a car if you're on the strip, definitely worth the trip!",

I totally understand the excitement about this location and how it reminds people of Voodoo Donuts from Portland but it's not the same. What makes Voodoo Donuts different from Donut Bar here in Las Vegas is that they never out.  They are continuously making their popular donuts for the people.  For example, if Donutbar knows that their French Toast donut is only sold on the weekend, then they should make enough, due to it's popularity.     In regards to their donuts they are super soft and fresh I truly enjoyed the split open strawberry donut because the strawberries are fresh and whipped cream is really smooth,Fresh & Light.  The strawberry cheesecake donut simply tastes like a strawberry jelly filled donut.",

    "text": "Every time we've attempted to go to the original SD location, we were deterred by the line wrapped around the building. So after our quick brunch at Bronze Cafe, we peeked over at Donut Bar and were shocked to be able to see the front door. It also gave us the chance to continue our tradition of donuts on road trips.  We walked in and perused the daily menu and made our way to the display case. The one that jumped out at me was the split donut stuffed with strawberries and whipped cream. My boyfriend stalks DB on Instagram and knew he wanted the Big Poppa Tart. I asked the sweet girl helping us out what the vegan options of the day were: apple fritter, creme brulee, chai latte cake donut, and yes, that strawberry cream beauty was in fact, a vegan soy-based whipped cream. The decision was easy for me because I'm not a big apple fan. One of each, minus the fritter.   The creme brulee was of the yeast-risen variety. On top of the golden brown donut was a cap of hardened caramel that shattered at the first bite. Bite two yielded a rich ooze of vanilla bean-specked custard. The chai donut was exactly what I wanted. I'm a lover of cake donuts and this one did not disappoint. There was nothing \"vegan-tasting\" about it. It was just a great cake donut. The warm spices gave this a Fall feel and I was happy this was an option available in May. The strawberry cream donut was saved for last. I discarded the top because by the time I reached this, it was a little dry. The cream was dense, but still light and I couldn't believe it was dairy free. The strawberries were perfectly selected, juicy and sweet.   I enjoyed the cake donut over the yeast-risen ones, but that's always been my preference. Still, I was very impressed by the vegan offerings. Street metered parking was easy to find because the location is in Old Vegas area.",

I had the bacon bear claw which was huge.  I also tried their iced coffee with nitro.  Got here as they opened so the line wasn't long yet but it was within 15 minutes.  I suggest getting here in the AM to snag parking.  Be warned all spots surrounding this place are paid parking... tow trucks circle around and so do the police.  You can pull up the the loading/unloading zone and be in and out in a flash.  Service was just as good as the donuts.   Be sure to take a minute to check out the restroom. You can thank me later.  I'll frequent this place moving forward when in Vegas.  Be back soon...",

The ambience is great, the decor is definitely interesting, even the bathroom is painted with Homer Simpson and his donut. If you're a fan of the show Tanked, then the fish tank if the lobby will interest you because it's one of theirs.   Their donuts are definitely a site to behold, all creatively decorated and looking delicious.   However, I have had better donuts. I got a Wonder Woman donut, it was cute and it was good, but it wasn't really anything to rave about.   My friend got a donut too, but her's was dry. Like take a but and crumbs everywhere dry. I don't think that should be the case when you eat donuts.   So it's a cool place to see, but I don't know if I would make the effort to go back.",

Saw this place in the evening after it had closed while walking near the Fremont district and made it a point to return on Saturday morning based on the excellent reviews. Ultimately was disappointed.  There were some highlights: fast service and an efficient setup to get customers in and out quickly. I always appreciate that. They also have some interesting flavors and combos.   Lowlights: All our donuts were dry. Not being dry is the number one requirement for a good donut, and Donut bar basically failed on that one, precluding it from anything more than three stars. I also think the bacon on pastries thing has passed its prime.  Ultimately Donut Bar has decent donuts, but they were dry and I wouldn't again venture out of my way to return.",

Well in a world where life inmates art, that is exactly the concept behind the now nationally recognized Donut Bar.   I work in a hotel in Downtown San Diego, and people from around the country ask for this place, by name! With a line out the door all the time, arrive early and expect to wait, but don't worry, you will not me disappointed. Its like willy wonka drank a bunch of local craft beer and conceptualized some of these out of this world breakfast desserts.   My suggestion is to buy at least 3: 1 to eat immediately. 1 to sit down upstairs and enjoy with some coffee. and 1 to give to someone else.",

Donut bar is very creative with their menu, everything we had tasted great my only gripe was some of the donuts tasted stale, I think this has more to do with the way they are being displayed and stored which ends up drying them out faster, because the make all their stuff fresh everyday and when they run out they are out. This brings me to my second point, the earlier you go the better these donuts taste, and the more variety you get. Overall I would say try it for yourself  not sure what it's called (apple fritter maybe) was amazing. Definitely going back and recommending to friends.",

The donuts are decorated amazing which is probably why they are so hyped, but overall they tasted just like average donuts. The price is pretty expensive compared to other donut joints.

It was a little too thick and works much better when it's just over a custard.   The Elvis had a peanut butter topping and a banana Bavarian cream center. Loved the peanut butter but hated the cream. It tasted like banana candy. Very artificial. I love banana and peanut butter, but real banana is better.

Came here on a random Wednesday morning around 8:30 am and parked on the street for $2 (didn't see any other parking).  I had heard that this place could have a line out the door with people waiting to order...I was a little worried that there might be a line to get donuts and at this point I was getting a little hangry.  Fortunately for us there were only about 4-5 other patrons inside and we didn't have to wait at all!  We were instantly greeted by the peppy workers with warm smiles and hellos, the place itself is pretty small with seating for only about 5-6 people inside.  They did say they had seating outside, but we didn't check it out because we were able to snag seats inside.   My friend and I really didn't know what to order so they gave us a couple of recommendations.  I also was super excited because they serve Stumptown Coffee from Portland here!  We ended up getting 4 donuts, 1 chocolate milk, and 1 Stumptown Coffee cold brew for the both of us all for about $20-$25.  A little on the pricier side, but just remember people these are specialty donuts not your run-of-the-mil grocery store ones.  I don't remember the specific names of the donuts so sorry in advance! -Donut with Strawberry Pop Tart In It -   Delicious, but wow this is super sweet!  My friend and I felt like we had to make an appt with our dentist after eating this one -Creme Brule Donut - This was the best one in my opinion, the outside had a nice crispy glaze covering it and when I say crispy I mean crispy, it had a tasty cream inside that wasn't overly sweet either -Lemon Cream Donut - My second favorite out of the bunch, the lemon whipped cream inside was amazing and they put a ton of the whipped cream inside too! -Boston Cream Donut Bar - This was probably the most basic donut out of the bunch, it was your standard boston cream donut bar...why my friend decided to get a basic donut at a specialty donut shop I will never know, but I digress...it was still decent!  -Cold Brew - not as good when I had it in Portland, it tasted a little bit on the bitter side but still delicious nonetheless  I for sure see myself coming back here whenever I want a tasty specialty donut, probably on a weekday morning though because nobody wants to wait in a ridiculously long line (sorry to all you normal 9-5 workers out there, I'll think about you the next time I eat here).",

    "text": "Based on the two mornings I went to The Donut Bar I can say they have amazing presentation but the basics are lost in the details. For example, this morning I had the fritter with bacon, the bacon was high quality and perfect, but the fritter was so done the edges were almost black. I could only eat the center of it. Yesterday I had an Old Fashion and a Strawberry Cheesecake donut. The Old Fashioned was dry , maybe cooked a bit hot, and the Strawberry Cheesecake just tasted like strawberry filing, no tangy cheese to give it that cheesecake vibe.   The staff are friendly, the donuts are very beautiful, and they brew Stumptown coffee. These are all good things but I have to have more substance with my flash.",

    "text": "From a donut standpoint, Donut Bar is simply dope. They were one of my favorites while in San Diego, so for me, the fact that they took over where O-face used to be is a straight up upgrade. Every donut they do is gourmet and you can tell they make them with care and keep them at top quality. They are also very community oriented and are always doing things hat put them out there so that people can put a face to the names. They were absolute life savers at Life Is Beautiful. They are also super cool because they post their menu for the next day on all their social media, so you know if your favorite donut is gonna be there and you don't have to guess. My only gripe is that they open relatively late for a donut place at 7am and it's super cool that they are open until sold out. This works out well for me since I work downtown so it's easy for me to get to but if you're not as lucky as me then you better make sure to get in as early as possible. Also, another super cool thing I'll say is that you should heck out their bathroom. It lets you know exactly how dope these people are.  Long story short, find a way down here. Eat some donuts. Walk out like a boss",

He was super friendly, and patient (willingly to deal with my awe of his menagerie of donuts.) If you like--love donuts, this is the spot for you. I was surprised it wasn't busier, because this business is definitely a force to be reckoned with in the Downtown scene.  I will even go so far as to say it's better than Pinkbox. So if you're craving something to satisfy that sweet tooth, look no further. Also, can we talk about the milks they have on tap? Innovative, creative, and fun! I will be back and with friends ;)",

The birthday cake one with the oreo in it was super dry. The blueberry donut was the saving grace out of the donuts. Pretty moist and flavorful but not enough for me to want to go back there.   WHY I NEED TO GO BACK: -I came late, maybe that's why the donuts were dry? I don't know.  -I want that strawberry whipped cream one. It looks good, so Ill go early to try it. -Everyone needs a second chance.",

    "text": "Pre-ordered on their website (available from 3-9pm the prior day). Choice to pick up at 8, 9, or 10 am. Minimum order of 1 dozen. Not all flavors are available for pre-order (didn't realize this was the case until pickup).   Friendly customer service. They have a coffee/espresso bar as well. The Sumpton coconut cold brew sold by the single serve carton was really good. Not too sweet with a hint of coconut.  Notes for the donuts I tasted this time:   db Nutella - didn't really taste like Nutella, more like milk chocolate with crushed almonds on top. Really large size, frosting was borderline too thin for the size of the donut. The donut part had good flavor and texture on it's own, which is always a good sign.   Creme brulee - smallest in size, but I appreciated that. Really enjoyed the crunchy sugar crust. The cream was also the perfect sweetness. My favorite of the bunch.   Butter beer - larger size. I was expecting a pronounced butterscotch flavor, but didn't even get a hint. The Harry Potter theme was cute.   Lemon pistachio - larger size. Hey, this one actually tastes like lemon and pistachio! Good balance of sweetness with the lemon.  S'mores on fire - standard \"normal\" size. The most aesthetically pleasing. The only cake donut of the dozen. Didn't care for the actual donut part which was a little dry and lacking chocolate flavor. The marshmallow on top was good; probably made in-house?   Maple bacon - bar shape, normal sized. I'm a fan of the whole salty/ sweet thing, but this was just ok.  Caramel latte - larger size. Had good caramel flavor, but didn't detect any coffee at all.  I feel like the names of the donuts set up certain expectations, but when the flavors weren't there, it was disappointing. I am willing to give them another shot though, since I did enjoy the creme brulee.",

Okay. Just 3 times.   The creme.brulee is a vegan donut that has a candy like carmelized consistency on top of it with a vegan made custard in that sucker. It's my fave out of all the donuts! For some reason when I bite into it-it reminds me of a Filipino dessert. Sometimes the top may taste a bit burnt minus it actually being burnt. You'll know what I mean when you try it.   Weekends they give away free themed donuts to the kiddos. Nothing like seeing your 3 year old elated to bite into an angry bird, minion, or even an avenger. But nothing like imagining a parents face knowing your child is about to bite into his last chunk of sugar for the month. Lol.  I'm afraid to admit I've tried a lot of the stuff they have to offer and overall, think they're all right. Nothing worth setting your alarm to, although, coming in early would be ideal because duh...the fresher the better. Everyone knows going to any kind of bakery towards closing won't get the best bite.   The big poppa tart donut they're raved about or known for is all right...says the person who can tolerate only so little sugar in one sitting. The one I've had was actually dry. =/   Overall, I'd still pop in on a Saturday morning with the fam...take our our donuts then walk over to the container park where the kids can release the sugar they just swallowed. Makes for a nice morning with the fam. It's worth giving it a try. I prefer this spot over Pink Box for sure...mainly because of their vegan.  I dont think theyre one of those must cross the desert for. If you happen to be by and feel like a donut, then definitely give them a try. But if youre coming without a donut craving at all, then more than likely you'll find them to be all right and overhyped.  Long lines some mornings. I'd skip bringing the stroller in if possible. But if you must...then you must...especially if you're in then out. Their strawberry milk on tap was pretty deelish too!  And something I've learned...these donuts have beers out there that pair really well together. Mind blown.",

The Big Poppa and the Creme Brulee were my absolute favorite, I would highly recommend them. Their nitro brew coffee is also very good!  The shop is small and can get kind of busy, but the employees do a good job being friendly while keeping everyone moving. I think that the prices are pretty good for the product that you get.

Overall I had a lovely first time experience the staff appears to have a bond and truly show respect for one another (REAL TEAMWORK)! Also,Upon entering I took the liberty of writing down a list of donuts from their Sunday Menu. I ordered Caramelized Pineapple,DB Nutella,Coconut dream,Blueberry Lemon and Creme Brulee which were ALL simply delicious.  Indeed the BEST donuts I've tasted thus far",

    "text": "The Donut Bar resides in what feels like Portland in Vegas. The place smells of wonderful and fresh baked sugary goodness the moment you step in. You're immediately greeted by the sight of colorful mouth-watering donuts that line up the glass displays. Just be mindful that this place closes by 1pm so plan accordingly!  I tasted the Creme Brulee donut and the Snickers donut. The Creme Brulee donut was a bit smaller compared to all the other donuts but that shouldn't shy you away from experiencing creme brulee in this doughy goodness. What makes the donut so great is the experience of cracking that shell. The sweet creme oozes out and that first bite takes you away to some far off French patisserie. It's a donut you won't find anywhere else and is a must try if you're going! The snickers donut is good for two if you're not looking to start your day on the heavy side. I enjoyed the snickers pieces on the donut but other than that it wasn't amazing.   If you're looking to try something new off the strip I say stop in and grab a donut. They have a huge selection but they only make a certain batch of each donut. They have custards to french toast donuts and no matter what donut you're loyal to, The Donut Bar has something to keep you happy. Each donut is $2-4 so you won't have to feel guilty about your sugar fix.",

Example:  The butter beer donut was big and had great design, but when 85% of your dough is dry, you are left trying to eat the overly sweet cream to compensate.

We found Donut Bar, just off the Strip's northern end, and parked in front at the pay to park. The display is varied and colorful, while not overwhelming and the shop itself is warm and cozy. Staff are very helpful as we had lots of questions. We had already drooled over their photo of blueberry with Meyer lemon topping: amazing. So I, like a socially isolated cave hermit, right away asked \"do you still ave the blueberry\" while my poor husband was trying to speak. The creme brulee was the next choice, followed by Mexican Hot Chocolate and Oreo. We took some old fashioneds to go. Well, now. I post healthy foods and recipes online, but donuts are an exclusion and we do indulge! All of these donuts were superb!! We sat in the small indoor bench area next to the Donut fish tank. The coffee was wonderful- a good alternative to your run of the mill donut shop. The quality and inventiveness add up to a big 5 BFFDS for me. If you must ask, that's \"best friendly fantastic donut supplier\". Vegan options are here too, evidently. Check it out: DB Las Vegas is a winner!!",

They flock in and sometimes line up for the very best donuts in Las Vegas perhaps nationally.  Always fun and tasty custom creations like French toast or creme brule'. You would never find beauties like this in a grocery store or chain. They are big, but still light enough to enjoy your own, but I suggest being ready to  share a bite if given that look. You know the look.  Service is top notch, the entire crew is cool, especially Mathew",

We were staying at a downtown hotel and decided to have a donut for breakfast. As soon as you walk into the store, you are immediately overwhelmed with the amount of choices you have! After carefully deciding, we went with 1 creme brulee and 1 Boston creme. The BC was just alright, nothing special just your average Boston creme donut. Now the creme brulee was awesome! The best part was hearing that crunch when pulled apart. I may have to figure out how to bring some back home.",

Before I even left my house I had Donut Bar bookmarked.  I was staying on the Strip, but luckily our friends had a rental car and agreed to drive us to Fremont for breakfast on Sunday morning. Street parking was plentiful at 9am and Donut Bar was super easy to find. We walked in and were immediately hit with the amazing aroma of fresh donuts and I was thrilled to see the variety available.  The four of us picked out 5 donuts, and the friendly employee being the counter recommend we try out the french toast donut, so we added that to our order as well. Everything I tried a bit of was absolutely delicious, but the creme brulee donut blew my mind with how good it was! And I think it's vegan too!  I hit my sugar quota early on and threw in the towel, but boy was I kicked myself later in the day for not ordering more to go! Next Vegas trip, I'm definitely planning on returning to try more!",

My most secretive haunts when you need that sugar pick up: indulge here.  The service this last visit was amazing as always. When one eats here you seem to become family. They care that you buy their donuts and in return provide consistent service that is always amazing.  There is not a donut on the menu that I have not tried; among the top favorites are the red velvet and the birthday cake. The prices here are fair ranging from $3-6 for a single donut. Mind you a $6 donut is well worth it for the flavor, delectable taste, and size too.  When it comes to the selection of their donuts they make average size small ones that are unique and decorated to the nines. They look like pieces of art. They also make donuts where indeed size does matter! These donuts are so I demand and will curb anyone's sugar desire.  This visit I had an iced coffee as well which comes iced of course. They make it fresh brewed daily. It comes unsweetened; this is how I enjoy it. If you desire sugar or milk they have a place to add those things.  Normally I do not talk in depth about the bathroom being a place you should visit. But one should check the Simpson art decor in the bathroom. It is stupendous, hilarious, and so unique.   It is not a question if I will return here: this review was in need of an update so go get some sin donut style!!",

After moving here, I felt like I would never find another good donut again but then I stumbled upon Donut Bar and all my donut dreams have come True. Donut bar just doesn't serve regular plain donuts-- you know those shops that only have cake donuts but they all have different colored frosting. meh. No, this place is the Willy Wonka factory of donuts! Some of my creative favorites are the creme brulee, homer's donut, butterbeer and the big poppa (poptart). Big giant donuts that are completely shareable with some friends, unless you are on that donut diet like I am.   If you see a crazy long line, don't leave! The line moves quickly and the customer service is on point. I strategically plan my visit during their happy hour, when they are about to close. You can fill a box for $10 and get all the donuts. Parking can be stressful since it is mostly street parking. Get ready to parallel. But no worries, a cup of their nitro cold brew will make all of your parking troubles go away.",

I had a donut nearly as big as my head that was topped with chocolate, cinnamon and marshmallows and tasted like Mexican hot chocolate. So good!",

We bought 8 donuts and most of it went in the trash. I live in Summerlin paid $20 for Parking and spent $35 for donuts. Wanted to see for myself what all the hype was about.  The donuts are just BIG Oversized donuts that look pretty, some average as far as taste and some were really dry.",

    "text": "Really good donuts, but not as great as we imagined. We ordered the crepe brulee and big poppa both strawberry and s'mores and were sadly less than impressed. We thought they would have a very airy soft texture to them and they were a lot more dense than we like. They had good flavor but we definitely have to knock them on that dense part. The big poppa goes with the name because it's huge! We could barely finish one together. The do have nitro cold brew here which I'm a huge fan of and will recommend it to everyone that loves coffee! Paid around $20 for two big poppas and two creme brulee so it is a bit pricey. Overall good donuts. With the reviews though we just weren't as wowed as we thought we would be",

The coffee is what keeps me coming back though. Coffee & donuts are like peanut butter & jelly! There's hot self-serve drip coffee that is solid and the cold brews are on point.",

I've enjoyed the Salted Caramel, Mexican Hot Chocolate, Blood Orange and Creme Brulee donuts, while the  Big Poppa Tart makes a good one to share, huge and stuffed with an actual Pop Tart and likely several days worth of sugar. I tried the Matcha on a recent visit and it was okay, small and not too sweet, but the Strawberry Split has my heart- fresh fruit, whipped cream, photogenic and shareable! Eventually I need to go back for the Caramel Latte donut and their Grilled Cheese.  TIP: Go early and check their online menu to be sure they have what you want, selection varies daily.",

    "text": "so reading the reviews for this shop, I was expecting some deliciousness, some extraordinary, some awesomeness and all I got was another \"wtf\" moment, and a feeling of \"should I call and complain and ask for my money back\"...I mean, I dropped $25 for 8 donuts...ya let's get to the review...  so I found myself in the downtown area recently, and remember hearing about a donut that crunched on top, looked it up and was happy it was there. so I drove over to the spot in downtown, and checked it out.  walked into the shop, it's small, narrow, but it gets right to the point. the display of donuts was very nice. they all look delicious, and in my mind I was excited to finally try the assortment I was putting together. I went for 2 of the creme brulee donuts, one that I think had a velvet cake inside, one of the poptart donuts, a white sprinkle, and a chocolate top one and some others. total was $25 (price shock hits, it's donuts!!) but ok I paid it, drove home and dove in with wifey. this is where it just went wrong.  now, I usually don't take photos, but recently I have been of the meals and stuff I'm eating or places I'm going to, and this place got the picture...  every single donut we ate was dry. they were all over cooked I guess. the batter used had no flavor or sweetness. the flavors were not there, it was like trying to enjoy it but not...I only took a bite or 2 of each donut and trashed it. throughout the day just picked at them all. when I got the one that crunches, the creme brulee one, I was just SO let down. the taste was honestly gross. that mixture of the crunch on the top of your mouth, then mixing it with a soft/dry donut that has no flavor was just really gross. and I'm not picky, especially when it comes to what should have been sweet and delicious, was a major fail.  again, every donut was dry, and they all had no flavor or bland flavoring. even the pop tart donut was a bust. the cake mix they use is just no good. I don't know if it was that day or what, but no go for me.  now, I've tried pink box donuts which was ok. the only donut shop here in town that seems to be excellent every time is Winchells on Meadows Lane with the subway. that place is 5 star superb.  I understand though, this donut bar place, it made it on tv or whatever, and people want to see it, but all these 5 star reviews  is just not possible if it's consistently like my experience when quality comes in. check out my photos...you'll see what I mean.",

I went with the peanut butter donut and the maple bacon one and although more cake like than donut, both were delicious and worth the visit. I came late in the day on the second visit as I was with my brothers, so the selection was still good, but not everything was available. My brother loved the Nutella donut and the cream pie eclair was a hit with both of them. Coffee was strong and will definitely wake you up!  Check out the new fish tank they installed in October 2016 and this is no ordinary tank. It's filled with donut shaped ornaments that almost look like the real thing. How clever!   We'll definitely be back and maybe even try the french toast donut next time. This place is a hit  as far as I'm concerned. Parking is on the street and is metered, but I can't see anyone staying more than an hour in this place. They are open until 1 pm or until they sell out of donuts, so for the best selection, get there early. Mmmm....can't wait to go back!!",

And that delicious fattening fried batter goes to....  OHH MY BIRTHDAY CAKE OREO   It was a very good donut but... I like my donuts with a little more fluff, a lot less sugar, and a custard texture in the middle. This was different. This was a donut with a reconstructed Oreo in the middle, with cake icing on the top with crumbles of Oreo and cake confetti. Sugar sugar and more sugar. If you strip all that and taste the donut, it's actually nothing special without that extra flavoring. The donut itself was dry. Again, good donut... I just have had a really good donut elsewhere that I hold high standards too.   I'll be real honest though... donut bar seems to only be good because of the flavoring that covers the donut. Strip all that way and you have a boring stale and dry donut.   Until the next review...",

Because when you are on vacation, everyone knows that all the rules of physics go out the door and any calories you consume are offset by all the walking you do.  #truth  My first order of business in Las Vegas was to find some delicious donuts other than the Krispy Kreme and Dunkin Donuts variety.  Located in downtown Vegas, I found Donut Bar!  At the time, I didn't know Donut Bar (original shop in San Diego) was listed as the Number 1 Donut Shop on lists from USA Today, <a href=\"/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2FThrillist.com&s=2318db7cc9d2a933066949f28dc05a7139148ba530a91c0fa15454d6d09279f9\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">Thrillist.com</a>, MSN and more.  But as soon as I walked in, I knew I had found a gem.    The donuts they offer are huge, over the top, and look downright amazing!  Their most popular is their Big Poppa Tart Donut which is made with a full pop tart and weighs one entire pound!  I wanted to try everything, but I decided on three:  creme brulee, blueberry with meyer lemon, and maple bacon.  The creme brulee is a yeast donut filled with creme topped with a hard candy shell.  For those with a sweet tooth, you will love biting into it.  For those that like their donuts a little less sweet, the blueberry with meyer lemon is  perfect.  The cake donut is topped with a perfectly lemony frosting.  My favorite was the maple bacon bar.  The yeast donut is so soft and topped generously with thick and chewy bacon pieces that paired with the sweet maple frosting like a dream.  Mmmmmm....  It's a bit of a gamble as they close when they sell out, but if you visit Donut Bar after 10am, they serve donut ice cream cones!!!  I will get one of those one day!",

    "text": "It's a doughnut shop. If you like specialty Donuts you'll probably like this place. Personally I'm not a big doughnut fan and the one I tried was just incredibly sweet. Too sweet in my opinion but others may not think so. Service was very good and friendly. Their lattes are horrible however. On top of that I burnt my mouth on the first sip. I like giving other businesses over Starbucks my money when it comes to specialty coffees but I have to look for someplace other than Donut Bar to get one.",

Yes, you'll also want to order one just to see if it's possible to finish one. Plus, they have very appealing regular sized donuts, so you may as well order one of those as well!  I am also curious if the fish tank has real donuts at the bottom or fake ones - that was the hot debate in our group. I still say no way those were real! Bonus tip, use the restroom before you leave for the wall art!",

Add in the warm service and awesome, reasonably-priced delicacies at the Donut Bar and it's almost heaven.  I tried the signature Creme Brulee donut and loved it. The donut itself was not too sweet and the creme in the middle was delicious. The hardened glaze on top cracked in a fun way as I bit in.  They had dozens of other delicious looking donuts, ranging in sizes, which I liked too.  If you're just there for a quick bite, grab a small donut.  If you're in the mood to indulge, they have enormous donuts in all sorts of unusual flavors and with great decorations.  I was especially intrigued by the grilled cheese donut but will have to check that out next time I'm in town.  We got iced americanos two days we were there.  So refreshing.",

    "text": "So 200 plus reviews later not sure anything else can add.....but here we go anyway. I am just about positive am the last yelper that I know in Vegas that finally checked out Donut Bar. I noticed recently Donut Bar has started to open maybe once month or random times at night. So was like NICE finally get to try the pop tart and the creme brulee. All the videos seen of the creme brulee and one of the stables pop tart looked delicious. I do love my donuts from time to time.   I heard that generally there a line when first open and the earlier get here the better. The later you come not really the best idea cause they make only so much donuts everyday and by the end slim pickings (truth nothing worst then stale donut). I got down little earlier because not sure where the place was and parking downtown flat out sucks. Honest if you park near Donut Bar they have self pay parking meters. If ur lucky depending time of day its SUPER easy and cost is cheaper then paying any hotel or parking structure. Dollar on the meter gives you hour. More then enough time (maybe if the line is long then that another story). I was surprise but the line was not that bad only four people ahead of me. Just the fact there was LINE for donut shop still blows my mind. Donut Bar does carry strong name brand.   Chef Jeff is not only a passionate owner. The guy knows his donuts and all positive vibes. The minute he open the door greeting all five or six of us come on in. Friendly, all smiles, and love the atmosphere. The smell was awesome minute walked in!!! Fresh batch of donuts, the display case truly gives the donuts even more eye candy, the diversity crazy (oversize homer donut, rectangle pop tart, small circle creme brulee, traditional size ones but nothing traditional with the flavors or colors, and untraditional ones with donut cones fill with ice cream or strawberry split), and it long line of donut goodies. You might forget the selection at the top of the line. The place is small so gets filled up fast if want sit down. It located literally next to Carson Kitchen or look for the famous Donut Bar sign outside.   The stumpton cold crew deserves shout out. I never had that brand before. I decided try the coconut flavor cold brew in carton. It was perfect compliment go with the donuts. They have other flavors. I believe one was chocolate and the other not sure. They also offer it on tap if you like.   The donuts the pop tart is HUGE. If one person can eat one that pretty good. The way pop tart melting into the donut not sure if tasted any of the crust associate with pop tart. The filling you know if fan of pop tart is True and True. The icing and the goodies on top just pushed it sugar overload. I loved it. The creme brulee was good. I think that one better eat it on the spot cause the longer it sits the crack on top break it apart. Rock solid. I had fill out my box was got strawberry split. The strawberries was fresh, juicy, and I keep thinking strawberry shortcake.",

I first tried the Boston cream donut and while it was delicious, it tasted a little bit too fried. I'd get it again but I'd prefer if it weren't as oily.   I tried mud pie next and I couldn't stop eating it, it was so good. It has a peanut butter drizzle on it, which I don't like too much, so I'd probably try something different next time but the donut part was so good and not too fried like the Boston cream.   I'm obsessed with the look of the homer donut and will have to try it someday. FYI the menu is posted every day on their instagram!  Get there EARLY I've heard they have crazy lines. I went around 830 on a Monday and we were the only ones there. I'm sure the weekends are insane.",

My girlfriend and I were in Vegas visiting her family and I thought I'd try my luck at a local donut shop. I really enjoy cake donuts and specialty donuts, so let's see what Vegas has to offer.  I came across the Donut Bar. The shop is pretty small but the donuts are enormous! I walked in and thought I died and went to heaven...this place is amazing!  I was created by friendly and helpful staff to assist me with my order.  Sooooo many choices and they all look delicious.  I got a dozen because I didn't want to miss out on anything!  I also shared with my girlfriend's family...to help educate them on the finer things in life!  The apple fritter with bacon, I think it's called \"the Brad\" but it is fantastic!  Apple and bacon together is a match made in heaven.  I also tried the \"big daddy\" which was a donut with an entire s'more inside (there are other flavors)..genius! The pumpkin spice was also good.  My girlfriend's mom had the creme brulee...she loved it.  My girlfriend had the birthday cake Oreo donut and wouldn't share so I'll take that as she liked it.  You can't go wrong here.  I highly advise anyone to go here if you're in Vegas...these donuts are life changing!  If I could give them 6 stars I would.",

As we were leaving los vegas i decided to take my family here unannounced. They were not thrilled, donuts? Is what I heard from them.we had not had breakfast yet but we were in downtown and I decided to treat my self.  Pleasing my family is never easy, but the Donut bar delivered. My sister is a vegan and a food snob, (guess what they make amazing vegan donuts,  so amazing they don't even want to tell you so that you don't try them!)  My parents are very set in their ways and we're not thrilled by  donuts for breakfast......it's so good once it hits your lips!!!!!!!! My family were taken back by the creme Brule donuts, than the strawberry cream, and the lemon pistachio.  But when I got the maple bacon donut (I've had dreams about this thing ) they looked at me like I was crazy. It was amazing!  I had to force them to try it but they ended up loving it. Thank Donut Bar because of your donuts our family tension  was gone we were able to bond and have a good drive home. Your donuts saved the day!",

This time I was smart to call first before heading there because downtown can be a pain in the butt. The first time I went was disappointing because an hour before closing, everything was already sold out. And that was the time I had a friend in town as well. But this time around, I wasn't disappointed about the options per say, but actually the taste tbh. There was a deal going on that they sometimes do on the last hour of opening and they either do buy one get one, or fill a whole box of donuts for $10. Of course we ordered the famous creme brulee, strawberry cream cheese and the pumpkin spice. I was too juiced to crack open the creme brulee. As far as taste, it wasn't that great. It was very sweet. Too sweet. The hard top of the creme brulee was nice and crunchy but overal it was OK. at least the donut itself was soft. The donut on the strawberry was weak. I could make it at home. The pumpkin spice was the tastiest. The filling was good too. Next time I need to try the ice cream donut cone when it gets warme",

When I came in, I was excited to see a lot of fun options ranging from pistachio to strawberry cheese cake to the classic and delicious maple bacon. Most of the donuts were huge and still very well priced ($2-$4)! On top of it all, the staff was sooo friendly and that made my experience even better!",

I waltzed in and was greeted by a nice lady who was behind the counter, she was giving me the spiel of the place but  i was in a mad rush so abruptly looked around and saw the oreo birthday cake one so just pointed and said \"that one 2 please\". and rushed my dough boy butt on outta there. Upon my hasty retreat I noticed that they offer a YELP CHECK IN DISCOUNT: of a cup of fancy  coffee. I didn't even have time for that :/. I was literally eating on the run and my donut was a tastebudgasm and a half of phenomenal yumness so i can only imagine what their other sweet wonders behind the counter must be like. So your's truly Benjamin glutton shall return to this purveyor of fried dough to further investigate but so far i'm a fan :D.",

    "text": "I'm a huge donut guy and people always mention Donut Bar in SD and they tell how great and amazing they are. I've never been to that location but I was in LV right when they had a soft opening of their new location there. Being the donut snub that I am, woke up at 7am and took an uber from the strip to their shop DTLV.   I liked the shop a lot. Warm and inviting with lots of donuts on display and the staff was super friendly. I came all the way from the strip so I wasn't just gonna order a couple donuts, specially when everything looked so good. I ordered a dozen.   The good donuts: homer, mexican chocolate, triple chocolate and big poppa tart.  The not so good: old fashion, red velvet, s'mores and chocolate bar.   As you can see they are good at making your typical donuts, but not so good at making cake donuts (which are my favorites). The old fashion donuts were really dry. Extremely disappointed by that since it's one I always enjoy. The red velvet and s'mores were also dry. Since I was paying a premium for each donut I was expecting high quality.   However, the homer and mexican chocolate saved the trip. Those were HUGEEEE, really good, fresh, soft and delicious. If I ever go back those are the ones I would order again.   I've come to realization that the over-the-top donut shops aren't my favorites. I've visited several ones with high expectations but I always end up a bit disappointed. Donut Bar was okay but not dying to comeback.",

    "text": "So, with this place receiving so much fanfare I had to stop in and see what all the fuss was about. I arrived when almost all the donuts were gone but still managed to score a dozen with the help of my good friend. We walked right in and were greeted by the friendly and fun staff. We viewed the menu for the day and could not believe the variety of donuts. There were at least  20+ flavors to choose from and this included vegan choices which I can totally get behind. These aren't just donuts, some were like mini cakes and were almost big enough to cover your whole face (No Joke)!  I had never seen such large donuts before and could not believe how creative these people are with the large variety of choices. We managed to score some delicious options, such as the Strawberry Split, Mexican Hot Chocolate, Blood Orange, Boston Creme, The Oreo Donut (with an Oreo inside) and a couple of creme brulee'. My favorite donut from this batch was the Boston Creme. The creme oozes with flavor and tasted heavenly. The donut itself was moist and fresh. The creme was so rich that I found it a little overwhelming to eat in one sitting so I ate half the first day and finished it off the second day. Yeah, it was rough....   The Strawberry Split was layered with fresh strawberries and whipped creme in the middle of a large sugar donut. A different take on the strawberry short cake and perhaps a step up. I almost added a small drizzle of chocolate since I had it for dessert that night. I shared the other donuts with my staff and family and they were all very complimentary.  My daughter really liked the Oreo Donut and was surprised when she found the cookie in the middle. The service was outstanding and so friendly. The shop is quaint and very clean with not a whole lot of room and it makes this place nice and cozy. They also have a new t- shirt for advertising that is available for purchase. It has a great color scheme and it gives a shout out to our city! I can hardly wait to go back early in the morning when the donuts are fresh out of the fryer. I think I can hear a Homer donut calling my name.",

It was my first time & I heard this place was the place to be for donut lovers, which I am. Drove over to a still sleepy yet incredibly sunny downtown LV where I parked in an empty parking lot.. The heat was already starting to sear the air in my car..  I had gotten there a bit early to my surprise so it was about 11 minutes before I made my way to the entrance. I walked and turned the corner as the low murmur of the crowd awaiting reached my ears. There must have been about 7-9 people in front of me.. And by the time Donut Bar opened their door- I was no longer last, but found the line had started to wrap around the corner I had turned on earlier.. People made their way in and I trailed behind. As I stepped in, I relished in the coolness that hit me (thanks A/C). Then I saw the sight before.. Donuts, all shapes and sizes.. All different from each other and so many to choose from. But the one that caught my eye was the classic strawberry donut, you kno with the whip cream and blueberries and the stuff sits in between two halves of a donut. Oh yeah, that's the one.   I got my goods and saw that the line had only grown even longer.. And I was immediately thankful for the rude yet early awakening. I sat outside in the little courtyard and ate the delicious thing. I could NOT even finish it- it was so giant and so good.. It was quite overwhelming ! But it was so worth. I left feeling stuffed but so happy.   If you're ever around, pay this place a visit and set your alarms because you will want to come here to try their vast array of donuts. Service is speedy, efficient & awesome. Prices are more than reasonable. And donuts are FANTASTIC.",

The caramelized sugar tasted burnt and had a slight bitterness to it. The donut itself and the creme barely had any taste. It wasn't too sweet (which is a bonus for me) but it wasn't too ANYTHING. Im kind of disappointed and I've definitely had better donuts for cheaper prices. On a positive note, very cute inside and service was great! Parking can be a bit tricky--the parallel parking available near the store is all pay-to-park",

Having myself already visited the San Diego location, parking a serious issue for good-yet-expensive goods that failed to wow in the same way as Sidecar, Blue Star or Stan's in LA, arrival at Donut Bar Las Vegas shows little to have changed from the space's previous occupant and although coffee has been replaced by Stumptown the prices are equally as aggressive while a general lack of seating remains.  A bit picked over at 1:45pm on Saturday, the Fritter gone but a dozen novel options including cake, raised and Specials all accounted for, service at Donut Bar takes a page from the youthful kids at O-Face and currently using a few staff from sunny SoCal to educate cashiers as well as customers the knowledgebase and readiness speak to experience and the Turn-Key location, though quality of the fried dough will certainly need some tweaks.  Taking the goods elsewhere to eat, conversation about everything from music to donuts and the local dining scene spanning across two-plus hours of small tastes, a first look at Donut Bar's raised options speaks of sharable portions that may help to soften the $3/each pricing and with a soft center somewhere between Brioche and Angelfood the texture shines in the setting of several glazes, classic candy bars no doubt playing a role in several of the variants.  Clearly needing some time to adjust to the desert with items featuring cocoa powder, both the triple chocolate and red velvet far too dry to be enjoyed, additional cake options were hit-and-miss in terms of consistency, the Blueberry Meyer Lemon unfortunately tasting as though it comes from the same mix sold for 69-cents elsewhere while the Girl scout themed Samoa was far more toothsome, perhaps as a result of coconut oil that several local Vegan bakers use to retain moistness in their cakes.  Not really shocking anyone with Maple Bacon Bars in 2016, the Vanilla Cream-filled Long John equally yawn inducing but more tasty overall, Cinnamon Rolls kept under warming lamps fail to hit the same highs as nearby Glutton or other artisans like Mothership or CRAFTKitchen despite a similar price per portion, the signature \"Big Poppa\" appropriately compared to \"Fair Food\" by a youngster joining in our tasting, the added jelly almost admitting that the Pop Tart alone is nothing but a gimmick and nowhere near the housemade quality of jams, creams and compotes made daily at O-Face.  TWO AND A HALF STARS:  Recently seeing a growth in diversity as relates to donuts, nearby Pawn Donuts and Coffee sourcing better from Donut Mania while Real Donuts on Charleston fares slightly better in texture at nearly half the price only half a mile away, one hopes that Donut Bar received a more favorable lease than that which doomed O-Face or their OC Location...or that they have some tricks besides freebies to help bolster their branding before they are too far out of the gate.",

    "text": "I realize this is an outlier of a review, but I did reach out to Donut Bar via their website with no response. Overall, these are some good donuts. I had the maple bacon cinnamon roll before we headed off to Death Valley and Northern California. The first few bites were pretty amazing, but things turned when I got closer to the center, which by this time we were in Indian Springs. The girlfriend thought it was a molten center, but it just turned out that the center was COMPLETELY RAW!  I'm not saying this was the contributing factor to some stomach problems I had for the following few days, but exactly rule it out either.   The other thing is the kids donuts they have on Saturday. And while they are cool, they are really no different than those over-iced heavily food colored donuts you can get at a supermarket.",

    "text": "We used to go to this other donut place close to our house, but have stopped patronizing them because of their rude costumer service. Last Mother's Day, my hubby asked me where I wanted to go, and since I have been craving donuts and had the donut bar bookmarked for a while, I asked to go here. It was quite a bit of a drive considering we live in southwest, but we decided to go anyway. We got here around 12:30-1ish, and they only had a few selections left. Don't know if it was because it was Mother's Day, but the lady behind the counter informed us that because of the limited selection, we could get a box for $10 and fill it with as much donuts as we could fit. Although the creme brulee donut was sold out and it was slim pickins, we were still able to get a decent amount of very yummy donuts. What would normally be a donut worth $3 a pop, we were able to get a full box for only $10! My favorite amongst our choices was the caramel latte donut. I thought it would have been too sweet, but it was actually just the right amount of sugar. Another favorite was the espresso donut, even though I'm not a big fan of the cake kind. We brought the box back to my in-laws house, and everyone was raving about the donuts.   Fast forward to today-- My husband, son, and I had a hankering for donuts and braved the early Sunday morning drive to downtown. We got to the donut bar just a couple minutes shy of 8am and there was already a long line outside the door, waiting for the store to open. When 8am rolled around, the chef (?) opened the door and gleefully greeted the people waiting in line, and then proceeded to usher everyone in. We could smell the freshly made donuts before even stepping foot inside the store, which only fueled our hunger more. Upon stepping inside, it was such a different experience from when we went during Mother's Day. The cases were full of different flavored donuts, both fried and cake donuts alike. I truly felt like a kid in a candy store! The girl behind the counter offered our son a free inside-out themed donut, which I thought was really thoughtful-- they really cater to their customers at this place! Anyways, it was so hard for me to order since I wanted to try everything!!!! But we settled on the French toast donut (which was made to order ), a creme brulee donut (obviously a crowd favorite), a Samoa, and a chocolate euphoria for my son. The French toast donut was good, different, and well worth a try. The cup of stumptown coffee they serve there went great with the donut. The Samoa was pretty good but, as I'm not a big fan of cake donut (my hubby is), I think I can pass on that next time. My son enjoyed his chocolate euphoria, and started picking on the chocolate shavings as soon as the donut arrived. Last but not the least, the star among the donuts we chose, the creme brulee donut. It was quite small, but for only 2 bucks, it was a steal! My hubby did say that the caramelized sugar on top was a bit thick, but we both agreed that the donut was great and surprisingly not as sweet as we thought it would be. The creme brulee filling was smooth and velvety, just how it should be, and accompanied the donut very well. I would honestly come back here just for another one of that donut, but I would be lying if I didn't say I want to try more. I might just have to make it mandatory that we go here every Sunday so we could try out a different donut each time. The strawberry shortcake donut they had looked mighty good, as well as the s'mores donut... I'm drooling just thinking about it XD  Although there are plenty other donut shops close to our house, the drive to downtown just to go to donut bar is well worth it. Not only are their donuts great, but all the associates we've had the chance to encounter were all so sweet, helpful, and personable. No wonder people keep flocking this place. Customer service is obviously a priority on their list, and there is nothing better than that... Aside from the donuts, of course lol. Donut bar, you have just gained new loyal customers who will try to frequent your place every Sunday :)",

It's location is close to a seedy area with some homeless sleeping in the alley way on the way to parking, the parking is 15 minute only,so we made the order to go. We tried the red velvet,blueberry,mudpie, creme brulee, nutella overload, chocolate and strawberry shortcake. They give you 1 free donut per dozen, or a coffee of you check in Yelp,we also ordered capuccinos. Ok out of all those I would suggest the nutella overload and the mudpie, the others are just ok. Would I go here again as a matter of craving, not really. But worth it at least to try and for the experience of artisanal donuts and social media posting if you are into that",

This morning I ordered a dozen donuts and I had to try the French toast one and thankfully I got one of the last ones!!! it is by far the most delicious scrumptious, warm, perfect amount of sweetness,! it was just delicious.   I can't believe this was my first time trying this I literally work right around the corner how come I didn't know it existed so delicious hats off to the chef and the gentleman and woman working hard I would defiantly recommend this place!   #bestintown",

Low and behold........ a \"Donut Bar\" across the street.   And many folks know me and donuts.   Well, even though I have 4 donuts waiting for me back at the hotel (which I have to walk back to), I figured.. What the heck.   What discipline. After serious consideration, talking to other patrons and using the boys room.... I settled on 1 donut. It was the cream brulee. $2  Was it worth it?  Yes. Yes it was.   Now to roll back south.   Happy eats.   BTW, the other donuts I have waiting are from a very early run to Pink Box Donuts. Pretty darn good there too and at reasonable cost. I guess this is what helped me stop at 1 donut at Donut Bar.   A wise choice. Go with the Brulee.",

First off they don't open until 8 am on the weekends, for someone like me 8 am might as well be noon on the weekends.  The glaze and toppings they put on their donuts is really good, the dough though is too much. It's too \"bready\".  To me it doesn't taste like a cake donut, it taste like 4 slices of white Weber's bread (sans the crust of course) with topping on it.To me a donuts dough should be on the light side of sweet and cakey.. maybe they bake them here, I can't say for sure. I can be a bit snobbish about my donuts, but everyone in our group agreed on that one point, I listed above.",

The creme brulee donut was the reason I found out about this place but the donut itself is pretty decent mainly only for the aesthetic appeal.

I decided to follow them for a while, and after dreaming about their donuts for months, we mad it in.  This place does not disappoint!  The service was helpful and friendly.  Come hungry.  The donuts are massive!  My hubby got the Creme brulee, a yeast donut and I had a cake donut called, a buttermilk it was covered with some type of chocolate ganache.  My husband decided to order. Nitro cold brew coffee.  Everything was delicious!  It's not cheap food at all but, everything was so well made and delicious it's worth the expense.  My donut was crispy on the outside, light and cakey on the inside and the chocolate was the exact right amount of sweet.  My husband's was just like Creme brulee.  It had s nice crack on the outside and delicious vanilla custard inside.  You could even see the Vanilla bean speckles.  There is a small sitting area outside with adirondack chairs.  This is a must visit and lives up to the Instagram photos. Totally worth the check in.",

    "text": "Not to long ago I tried donut bar for the first time at the farmers market at downtown summerlin. I enjoyed just about every single donut they had and the guy who had helped me pick out some of them was super nice and friendly. So today I decided to drive from the other side of town to get some more of their donuts cause I enjoyed them so much the first time. Well I got there, first off the building is way to small they need to have a bigger space to walk. People kept running into each to get to the line or from the line to check out. Second off we were waiting in line and no one was helping us it seemed to be they were helping everyone around us, including the people that were behind us. Finally I had to ask someone to help us. Third after I had gotten home I dug into the donuts and they weren't as good. I had bought some that I knew were good from my previous experience at downtown summerlin and some new ones to try. I had gotten a maple bar, how can someone mess up on a maple bar? Honestly their donuts need more flavor. The donut itself is amazing, it's soft and moist but they have lack of flavor from the fillings and from the frostings.  Honestly you'd be better off going to a grocery store than here.",

Not my cup of tea BUT someone else may love it. The vegan selection was smaller than I thought because there were only 2 options at the time I went in but it's nice they have some. The filling was good and the people nice. Again the review is based on my taste and preferring a glaze versus the crust of the creme brulee. So don't hesitate to try it.",

We were so excited to try these donuts so we showed up at 7 am on Sunday morning because when we called the day before the employee told us that we could preorder and pick up at 7 am.  However, we decided to just to go right when they open.  So once we got there we were greeted rudely by the manager telling us we weren't allowed in to buy any donuts since they don't open until 8 am.  We then decided to call to make an order on the phone which the employee told us that we could pick it up right away even though they haven't opened.  So we decided to place the order and were so excited waiting outside for our donuts: however, we waited for 40 mins and no one came out.  We decided to give them a call back and the employee stated that the manager wouldn't allow him to sell us the donuts at that point we were fed up and decided to leave because they were rude and unprofessional.  They should have given us a call back instead of making us wait for 40 mins.  Now I will never go back to an establishment that has bad customer service even if they are rated highly.",

The French Toast donut was AMAZING!  The creme brulee donuts were not very good. The sugary top was very hard and the doughnut was honestly just not good at all. The 4 star rating is more for the French Toast....the creme brulee would have gotten 1 star.  I'd eat here again.  Their menu was awesome and they still had options around 10:15am on a Saturday morning. Go early though, certain donuts sell out quickly!",

It's a jelly filled donut with a peanut butter frosting on top. So good. They give free donuts to the kiddos on the weekends which helps when you're waiting in line for sure! The cold brewed coffee is also really good! The kids love picking out their own huge donuts which they never quite finish in one sitting.

Unfortunately, I don't believe so.  Some donuts tasted quite old. What a sad state of affairs to reach DB on a lovely Saturday morning to have stale donuts already in the case. Bro and I were excited to try the salted caramel raised, but... it was kinda tough. How heartbreaking!  Creme brulee donuts are delicious, but so small. This may be the one force in the universe that can actually make me enjoy cake donuts. Here I actually preferred them! Red velvet, Butterfinger and blueberry Meyer lemon were divine!  Coffee is on point, and music selection selection is pretty sweet at that! Despite so many upticks, in a neighborhood that sure could use upticks and has been gradually, proudly, bringing them in/keeping them here, the stars of the show -- the donuts -- were just meh. An overall A-OK experience.",

The outside is that caramelized sugar and the inside is a fluffy donut with vanilla creme. It's something that will be on your mind until you go back. Other than the donut, my favorite part was the vanilla custard/ ice cream in a cinnamon sugar donut cone. Yup, you heard me right. And it was drizzled in caramel sauce. Let's just say it got a little messy, but was so worth it. I came back every other day for a week for it.   *Key advice: They usually sell out everyday by 1 pm and close the shop when they sell out. And make sure to check in for a cup of free espresso or drip when you buy a dozen!",

Like I said, concept is cool but execution was ehhhh...  Birthday Cake w/ Oreo: So it was a birthday cake inspired donut with an oreo in the inside...but again concept is cool but execution was ehhh....  Maple Bacon: I guess this was my favorite one out of all of them just cause they actually executed this fairly comparable to a lot of other Maple Bacon donuts...

I was one of the lucky few that got to attend the Homer's Wet Dream event where I was able to sample many of the donuts sold by Donut Bar, so when making plans to dine at nearby Carson Kitchen one Sunday I decided to stop into Donut Bar first to sample more of their offerings.   I already knew that the Bigga Poppa, with a entire poptart inside, is the bomb. At $4 it's on the pricey side, but 2-3 people could share one of these, it's THAT big. The Creme Brulee is another donut I like, it is priced at $2 and is more of a standard sized donut.    For me.... it is all about the French Toast donut, cooked to order. If I had to choose one kind of donut to have for the rest of my life, it would be this one. Paired with a Stumptown Cold Brew, and you have one deliciously sweet breakfast.  Even if the over-the-top, stuffed donuts don't do anything for you, Donut Bar is worth a visit just to try the delicious French Toast Donut. (Sold weekends only)",

Pictures \"donut\" do this place justice as many of the donuts looked like they were on steroids, they were huge! Those ones seemed to be more of the plain variety though whereas the specialty donuts were of the smaller size. They have lots of yummy flavors and I couldn't decide what to get. Luckily the employees were patient while I waited to make my selections. I finally chose:   Strawberry big poppa tart Creme brulee  Blueberry cheesecake  Maple bacon My dining companion got the french toast donut and holy crap that was delicious. I should have gotten that.   I thought they were all pretty good. The blueberry cheesecake had a yummy blueberry filling, but I didnt find the flavor to be very cheesecakey. The creme brulee was a fun one. It had a hard caramelized sugar coating on top of it that was totally reminiscent of real creme brulee. I had a couple bites and the inside was a sweet vanilla cream. I brought the other half home to my brother who said he almost broke a tooth on the hard shell, so watch out! The maple bacon was probably my favorite. It was a maple bar with real chunks of bacon on top. The salty/sweet combo never gets old and was a delight to my taste buds. The big poppa tart was really just like an oversized poptart. I thought it was fun, but was honestly my least fave. For 4 donuts it was $12, I dont think that is very unreasonable for what you are getting. I can see myself coming back here for sure.  Pro Tip- If you follow them on IG @donutbar, you can check out their daily menu. They post it the night before so you know what to expect the following day.",

My one son decided on the donut \"cone\" with vanilla Ice cream, I decided on the apple fritter and my younger son got the birthday cake donut.  Here's where the review goes south:  My son tried and ate the cone with ice cream and  said that the cone tasted like pre made pilsbury pastry dough, the apple fritter I was expecting to taste full of apple and moist was VERY DRY, over cooked and had not much Apple to find in it and as for my younger sons birthday cake donut it too was very dry and made Dunkin look like the king of the cake donuts. The 3 donuts total were $11.00, yes that was for 3 donuts.  So for them to claim they are #bestdonutsintheworld not in the eyes of this consumer. Pink box donuts can easily out do donut bar on quality, taste and price.",

I went on a weekday so the French toast donut was not available. I got a dozen to try almost every flavor. I was disappointed in their popular creme Brulee donut. There was barely any filling in them. I ordered 3. Aside from the large size, there is nothing unique or worth coming back for. Although, I did enjoy the salted caramel and apple fritter.",

    "text": "Love me some Donut Bar. Sorry Ace, Ronalds, and Real Donuts, but Donut Bar has the BEST yeast-raised donuts in the Valley. This has become my go to stop for donuts in Vegas.  Donut Bar is my usual go to stop for dessert after I take a visit to the ol' PublicUs. I heard a lot about the buzz going on, how it was considered to be the best donut place in the country, so on and so forth. I just had to check it out for myself, and for the most part, its awesome. Awesome-sauce even.  Donuts are a personal thing, everyone has different likes and expectations when they have a donut. Let me tell you mine. I'm a big fan of brioche-style donuts, ones you normally see on dessert menu's at high end restaurants. So that means I like a sturdier type of donut, one where the chewing experience is very important to me. There are some that like the lighter versions of donuts, where they sort of disappear after you start chewing on them. For myself, I'm not a big fan of those types of donuts. That's where Donut Bar comes in. It does remind me of those amazing brioche style textured donuts, with an incredible mouthfeel, and flavor that is on point. I do like the fillings and creams that they use, they are all balanced, without being too sweet, and they are full of bright, impactful, flavors. IMO, their yeasted donuts are the perfect donut.  The coffee here is outstanding. They use a Stumptown bean, and they offer drip coffee's as well as cold brew, all of it is on point. The service here is also outstanding, everyone is helpful and friendly, and they do a great job.  So you are probably wondering why this isn't a 5 star review. Well, I'll tell ya. While their yeast-raised donuts are 5 star all the way... their cake donuts to me are just OK. And trust me, I've tried my best to like them. I've ordered them on three separate occasions, and it just wouldn't click for me. It might be a texture thing, I like my cake donuts to have a slightly crisp, thin exterior, with a super soft interior. But oh well.  I'll be back, their yeasted donuts are one of my obsessions. Haven't had a fritter yet because they are usually sold out. But you just wait, I will find you, and I will have my day.  By the way, Best Music Playlist.. Ever.",

I've tried a variety of them and the only one I don't think I'll be trying and kind of disappointed about is the Mexican Hot Chocolate (i think its called). All others are very worth the hour I waited in line and 5 blocks I walked yesterday due to the walk-a-thon happening in downtown LV. You should also try their house made strawberry milk.

Classic donut, pink frosting, and sprinkles. That donut was literally bigger than my face, it was very sweet, and delicious. Totally grab a coffee or milk to go with it!  Donut Bar is pretty popular. So the biggest downside is that there's not that many seats inside, they do have a few seat outside in the shade. It's Las Vegas, even in the shade it's like 102 outside.   I would totally recommend someone to go to the Donut Bar in Downtown Las Vegas!",

The building itself is a cool little place. Upon walking in you are immediately greeted and welcomed. The person helping me was able to explain each and every donut and asked me what preferences I had and suggested items to try. The selection was great on the morning that I arrived. I chose the Creme Brulee donut and a lemon cheesecake donut with a milk to go. The donuts are pricey, until you bite into them and realize the quality ingredients that they are made with. I was a few miles away before I tried my selections and immediately wished that I had purchased more. Great selection, priced right for the quality, and a friendly helpful staff. Do yourself a favor and check this place out, you'll be glad you did.",

    "text": "My first experience with Donut Bar was at at Yelp event where I tried their pumpkin filled yeast donut and it was pretty disappointing. The dough wasn't as perfectly light as I like. And I really prefer for the entire donut to have a thick layer of glaze - this did not. Also, the filling was barely sweetened and basically tasted like butter.   However, after brunch at eat. I figured I might as well stop by and give it another chance. This time I knew not to get a yeast donut and to try the cake instead. I went with one Strawberry Cream Cheese and one Apple Crumble. The latter was nice, but the Strawberry was even better because it was super sweet and flavorful. (In case you couldn't tell, I expect as much sugar as possible.) But both were moist on the inside (the Strawberry even had little juicy specks of red) and the outside had a nice thick glaze.   I went on a Saturday and there was a line to the door that moved at a pretty decent speed. There was a big family behind me and I believe I heard someone behind the counter say that kids get a free donut on Saturdays. Pretty cool! Does my three month old count? Haha!",

The place had an amazing selection, super night staff. The donuts were visually dazzling and did not disappoint in the taste department. Walked a box back to the Nugget, had a great breakfast, ziplocked the left overs.   Turns out they were still pretty flipping yummy the next night (two days later? Can anyone be sure of date or time in this magical city?) after a 4am hot streak on the tables when Hubby has a contagious sweet tooth.   Thanks for the treats!!!",

I got the mexican hot chocolate donut, which was $3. I thought it was worth it, not because of the flavor, it didn't taste much like mexican hot chocolate, or chocolate for that, but it did taste like a good yeast donut. It was huge, which totally made up for the price.  My bf got a s'mores donut, which was a big fail. It tasted like a less sweet version of something dunkin donuts (a favorite of mine) would try to make. At $3, and a quarter of the size of my donut, I didn't think it was worth it.  All in all, this is pretty much hype. Try it out and tell me what you think!",

Anyway, the cream filled chocolate bars at Donut Bar are to die for.    They have an awesome and creative assortment of donuts so there is something for everyone.  The best part of our stop was the iced latte's.  Good Lord the coffee here is incredible!  I live way up in Summerlin but I can honestly see myself take a spin to Downtown Vegas just for some of their donuts and crazy good iced latte's.  While we felt prices were a bit steep, I guess you get what you pay for as we, Cesar Q. and I left happy and wanting more!  The staff is outgoing and quite helpful when you don't know exactly which donut to indulge in.  There is street parking right our front of the shop so it's very easy to run in and out.  Damn, as I write this review I feel the need to go NOW for my afternoon pick-me-up!",

They may have different donuts depending on the season, but majority of them are the same. They're all very delicious though!   I just got a variety of donuts, choosing the ones that looked good. You NEED to get the Birthday Cake donut with an surprise Oreo inside. I was so excited for it. I heard a lot of hype for the creme brulee donut because of that *crack* when you break it... I tried doing that while recording it... fail. LOL. It's harder than it looks, literally. And I wasn't a big fan of the taste of it. So I went back to enjoying my birthday cake donut. YUM.

Some tasted better than others. Donuts tasted fresh and the cake wasn't dried. I had half of the green tea one. No green tea taste to it at all. In fact, it tasted more like a lemon flavored donut with green colored frosting on top. The strawberry shortcake and blueberry cheesecake however, was FABULOUS!!!!!! It really taste like it sounds.   I can imagine if you have a major sweet tooth, this place would be heavenly for you. I'm glad I was finally able to try their donuts though. But personally, I'm more of a cupcake kinda gal.

Quite possibly the best donuts (gourmet) that I have ever had. Located downtown, near Fremont Street (sp).  By the time we got there on a Saturday morning, maybe 9am, I guess their signature strawberry shortcake or whatever was sold out :( but we were able to try some amazing other donuts.  1. Creme brulee - they try and immolate the real dessert, and it doesn't disappoint. I normally don't like cream filling donuts, but this was light and sweet all that the same time.  2. Oreo / Bday cake - tasted just like it sounds  3. Some sort of strawberry filled donut  All three were amazing, coming from a chocolate and glazed kind of guy. The even more amazing thing is that they only cost around $2-3, so hopefully they don't raise their prices, bc that is an insane deal! There are some higher end donuts near where I live and they definitely don't hold a candle to Donut Bar!!  It will probably now become one of my Vegas staples!!",

We ordered the creme brulee donut, as the girl working told us it is their best seller, as well as the maple bacon bar.   Creme Brulee Donut: Very good, except for the fact that it took four bites before we got any filling. We genuinely thought it was just dough with a sugar topping and were sooo disappointed, so when we finally got to the filling we were relieved! It was tasty, but I wish it had more filling in it, as the bites without it just weren't good.   Maple Bacon: Super yummy! There was a ton of salty bacon on top, which balanced the sweet maple frosting well.   I would definitely come back here, and next time I would order something more exciting. A lot of the specialty donuts are HUGE, which is what kept us from ordering them this time.",

    "text": "Doughnuts to me are one of the Single Best items for one to indulge on and enjoy, Fried Perfection that is either Glazed, filled with Cream or even a Tart Fruit Jelly or topped with Sprinkles and nuts or bits of Chocolate. You might feel guilty by indulging on the Fried Goodness but live in Moment and be taken back to this Childhood Delight, when I was planning coming to Fremont Street for the very first time coming here for Breakfast was a must. After getting off the Deuce Bus, looking through some of the Stores, playing in one of the Casinos and walking down all the side streets and looking at all the Unique Graffiti Arts.   I found my way here located in a little Suite sized vicinity and as if the Sign wasn't enough of a Dead giveaway I'd say the Pink Donut on the Wall was one too. It was pretty late when it came to my Breakfast as it was nearing Quarter to 11 when I stopped in here. Seeing the menu outside they have 28 different varieties ranging from 2-5 bucks each from exciting things like Mexican Hot Chocolate, Triple Chocolate Threat, Oh My Birthday Cake Oreo and Chocolate Bacon (you can have Bacon for Breakfast in a different format). To even the simplest of flavors such as Red Velvet, Boston Cream, Creme Brulee and Pumpkin Pie, walking through the small cafe and seeing row upon row of Donuts made it even harder for me to pick.  I only limited myself to 2 Donuts but which 2 was the Question, although not a big fan of Boston Cream I thought it had the best presentation (with the Frosted Ghost in the Center). My choices were the Lemon Cheesecake and Nutella Overload, both placed in a Cardboard Box for me to take, then I sat down to enjoy. I started with the Lemon Cheesecake which had a light dusting a Graham Cracker crumbs (more powder like) with Vanilla Icing coating the top, as I broke into the Donut to find a light amount of Lemony filling packed with a Profound citrus flavor enough for me to enjoy and not give a lip puckering Punch.  The Nutella Overload was an extremely Decadent Experience, question is how many of us have taken a jar of the Chocolate-y Hazelnutty Spread and eat it right out of the Jar. We've all probably done it, but have you ever had it inside a Donut ?. I got past the Powdered Sugar as I yanked it open to find it almost completely filled to the brim and it oozing out all over (hence the Name). I felt like half the jar was put into this thing, I felt like Elvis Presley after he had his Peanut Butter and Banana Sandwich. Also interesting that they had a donut named after one of the most iconic Cartoon Characters of all time (Homer Simpson), its also awkward to run into him in the Bathroom with a literal speaking as there were lifelike drawings of him all over the Walls (that would be the last place I would ever run into somebody).  Their signature shirt (Donut kill my vibe) really got me as I do love Puns, I wanted to get one but they didn't have any 2 or 3X's. But I thanked them and was on my way to try and work it off, their Doughnuts are equivalent to Paula's Donuts in Buffalo. Rich, Fluffy and Enjoyable, like Michael Jackson said - Donut Stop til you get Enough !!!",

    "text": "The difference between a gourmet donut and an ordinary donut from Winchell's or Dunkin Donuts is difficult to appreciate. At prices that start at $3, the difference is dishearteningly small at Donut Bar.  The donuts here are visually enthralling. On an enormous, thick bed of fried dough, each donut is adorned with a thick layer of colorful frosting. The Homer donut looks incredible. It's hard to not want to at least try one of these bad boys.  While the gut-busting Big Poppa seems to be the popular choice here among Instagram enthusiasts, I opted for the maple bacon bar. This amounted to a lackluster maple bar with burnt bacon on top. I was disappointed as I dished out $4.",

In the Fremont Street Experience Area, Donut Bar is a cute, small donut shoppe that was put on the map with its signature Big Poppa Tart donut (it has a PopTart inside of it!). Let me tell you: if you have a sweet tooth, you'll LOVE this donut. It was simultaneously filling and light letting me get my fill without bloating me. In addition, the workers were SO sweet and patient, telling me about all the donuts I had a question about. This place is the MOST recommended foodie destination for anyone visiting Vegas (well, Most Recommended by me, anyways). Love, love, love!  Service, donuts, and price are all five stars :)",

Short Review:  - Been here a few times, and each time wasn't great.  - Spent $30+ on my last visit for 1 dozen donuts (not the grilled cheese/french toast btw) -- $35+ w/ 2 espresso   - I know my donuts, been nicknamed by others \"a donut expert\" haha, thanks)  I've been to several around the Vegas Valley and other cities.  - Yes, these donuts are large, pretty & Instagrammable, (a lot of people love this place) but they taste more like bread, not donuts. Dry, thick texture & seems like they were made the night before, while other places make theirs fresh a few hours before opening and throughout the day.   - the donuts are lacking in flavor.  - Customer service is lacking as well, pushy sales girls don't listen well over the loud music. She tried to sell me the french toast & grilled cheese donut 3 times after I politely said no thank you each time. Gave me confusing answers when I asked her questions. Cashier wasn't friendly or nice either. (Btw... they were not busy when I went in, 8-9am)   - They will still do well in business despite my review and many others like it. - I'm not sure what they use in their recipe but it made me sick for a few days :-(.   - If you were disappointed with the donuts or service here, and want tasty, fresh, flavorful, soft, affordable donuts go to Ronald's Donuts in Chinatown or Friendly Donuts if you're near Boulder Hwy / Southeast Henderson / Hendertucky area.  Long Detailed Review:  -- worth reading if you want to know why I dropped a few stars (about their donuts and service):  If you know me and my reviews I am honest about my reviews and tend to look for the positives (what's good) in a place, unless I got sick or something. I went on a Saturday after breakfast, would've came here for breakfast if we thought of it sooner. Glad we didn't. Read on to find out why...   At first, I thought the girl helping us was friendly until she suggested the grilled cheese donut and french toast donut at least 3 times. After I said no thank you each time.  I wonder if they get commission off of each french toast or grilled cheese donut they sell? I'll call them sales girls because after a minute or so they turned into pushy sales girls.  The music was so loud in there, I asked her a few questions and she gave me confusing answers. Somehow we still ended up spending $35 THIRTY FIVE DOLLARS FOR ONE DOZEN DONUTS & 2 Espressos. That's unheard of at any other donut shop.   I wouldn't mind if they tasted good but the dough in the donuts had no flavor, it tasted more like bread.   Basically, most of them tasted like bread with flavorless sugary frosting on it. I'm not sure what they use in their recipe but it made me sick for a few days :-(.   The donuts with filling in them, had a pea size filling, very small amount. The toppings and frosting didn't taste like their name.  The specialty donuts, like the Blueberry cheesecake, pumpkin, all the donuts we got were flavorless and disappointing.   I gave some to my family, hoping they'll like it and eat it all up but my brothers didn't even want to try any donut LOL. That is saying something. WHO REFUSES OR THROWS OUT DONUTS?! Not this girl or anyone that I know. We ended up throwing out a lot of the donuts.   If you like large donuts, Instagrammable donuts this is your place.   If you want tasty, fresh, flavorful, soft, affordable donuts go to Ronald's Donuts in Chinatown or Friendly Donuts if you're near boulder Hwy / Southeast Henderson / Hendertucky area.  2018 Yelp Challenge Review #14",

The environment felt very cozy and the donut selection blew me away.  There were so many different flavors to choose from and they had many specialized donuts that you can't get elsewhere. These definitely weren't your typical donuts. They also had coffee on their menu, which was a plus!  If you are ever in the Fremont St / Downtown area, I highly recommend going here. Make sure to arrive early while the donuts are fresh and still available. I guarantee everything you see will be absolutely droolworthy.  IG: @ravenousfork",

There are three more coming to California in 2019 and one opened up in Pasadena (Hallelujah!!!).   The creme brulee donuts are worth setting your alarm for because they sell out really fast as soon as the shop opens. I was lucky enough to try one and immediately regretted not getting at least three like people in line suggested that I do. I wanted to get a box of a dozen to sample, but honestly, I think three creme brulee donuts per person seems like a reasonable serving size portion.   The big poppa (strawberry flavor) was out of this world delicious! The strawberry filling inside was perfect and the drizzle on top tasted like heaven..   I'm having major taste bud withdrawals right now writing this review.. I can't wait to go back for more! :)",

The donuts are very rich and super sweet, one was more than enough for me, I suggest going with a group and splitting a bunch of them. Also ideal for parties and events as they are beautiful and sure to please. Great spot if you are craving something sweet!",

We got a maple bacon apple fritter--the last one. It was the only one left that wasn't just a \"regular\" donut. After all, we went there to try a fun, different type of donut, not just an old fashioned or a glazed donut. So, the \"bacon\" is just bacon bits that you buy in a jar--not real, fresh bacon crumbles like I expected. The fritter was dry and didn't have nearly enough apple in it nor glaze on it.  Had it been real bacon, and more apple, maybe it would have been worth the $4. Otherwise, I'd just stick to a national donut chain who knows what they're doing.",

Came in on a Saturday morning around 11am to find a small line of about 5 people formed waiting to place their orders.  Donuts are priced individually.  Picked up two nutella overloads, one strawberry cheesecake and one toasted coconut; total came to $13.   Nutella Overload: Nothing to call home about.  In my opinion, there was no 'overload' of nutella present.  This donut is basically a nutella-filled donut with powdered sugar dusted heavily on top.   Strawberry Cheesecake: This is a jelly filled donut (I believe strawberry jelly - hence the strawberry in the name), with a glazed topping and a dusting pile of what I believe is graham crackers.  I don't get any cheesecake from this donut, so I don't know why they find the need to call it a strawberry cheesecake donut. Toasted Coconut: An old fashion cake donut with toasted coconut on top. If you like coconut, you will enjoy the coconut topping. Overall, these donut were not terrible but they were not donuts that I 'gotta have' next time in Vegas.   Side note - there is metered parking right in front of the business which only takes credit cards.  Best bet, have someone drop you off and circle around and pick you up to save money on parking!",

I was the first in line and lines form fast right before opening.  I ordered, which was the day after the news of music icon Prince passing, the Price Donut, Creme Brule, Banana Caramel and the Boston Cream.  The Prince donut was well decorated with his symbol and filled with raspberry.  I liked it.  It was okay for me.  I did notice that the donuts I ordered, weren't as sweet as some other donut shops (not including frostings).  This was a plus for me, the amount of sweetness to the donuts were good for my liking.  The Creme Brule (Vegan), I wasn't a big fan of the \"caramel drizzle\" over the donut.  Some will like it, but it wasn't my cup of tea.  Everything under that topping was okay as well.  I love bananas so I tried the Banana Caramel (Vegan), and that was okay too.  At first bite, banana runts came to mind.  Last, Boston Cream.  I love donuts filled with custard, so I couldn't leave a donut shop without getting one.  This too was okay.  The breading wasn't too sweet, but the sweetness of the frosting complemented this donut well.  I really wanted the cinnamon roll with the bacon, but that wasn't ready when I got there.  There was a 15 minute wait :(  I'm still coming back to try that cinnamon roll with bacon and the french toast donut. :)  With that being said, Happy Eatings!!",

This was not worth the hype, we got a dozen doughnuts since we don't live in Vegas. The special doughnuts weren't anything special. The creme brulee didn't have enough filling nor did the other flavors. All the doughnuts tasted normal, flavors weren't special or \"wow\" about them compared to most normal doughnut shops. I've had better doughnuts in the east coast. This was such a disappointment.",

Got there at 1140 on a Friday so there were only three types of donuts left; Crete brulee, strawberry cheesecake, and Nutella overload. I wasn't disappointed with the lack of selection as I would have chose two if the three anyway. They were dry, and all disappointing in flavor. The brulee topping tasted burnt and not sweet and the cream was almost tasteless. The strawberry cheese cake was a jelly filled with cheesecake icing I guess? Not enough filling , couldn't taste anything like cheesecake, and the filling tasted cheap. The Nutella overload an underload with not enough filling. It was straight Nutella which was the only saving grace of the donut experience. They did have nitro cold brew which I tried and it was good but their cold brew was bitter and not smooth. Will not try this place again.",

The donuts are always delicious, but can't go for donuts too often if I want my clothes to fit! My go to is a large Hawaiian Hazelnut drip coffee, delicious and at only $2 a pop I can treat myself pretty often!

    "text": "I have to admit I was a little hesitant going to the donut bar.  After all, imho it had a large shoes to fill because of the prior tenant O Face Donuts. Sure, O face is now gone and one should not compare a defunct business to the next. But I cannot help it and I feel if you take the time to read what I mean, you may just end up agreeing. There is only one single difference between the two shops yet the difference is such a critical element. Creative originality. The Donut bar attempts to dazzle you with concoctions that are really just kids play. The creme brulee is creative in thought yet executed with no afterthought. Yea, the sugar is cool however only after one bite.  Attempting to get through the constant crunch soon became annoying.  I found myself trying to taste the center cream however once the sugar coating finally dissolved and my taste buds came to I found it to be just commercial custard filling. Very disappointing. The maple... O face had was one step ahead of everyone on this.  When you go to a donut shop,no matter what part of the U.S. you go, you know what a maple bar taste like. It doesn't change and when you have one, you have had them all. O face however took the time to develop their own maple glaze which complemented the bacon. Donut bar..the same usual maple. The oreo cookie Jeez...how much sugar can you give? People, this is a regular glazed stuffed with an oreo cookie.  mmmm Lard  O face made donuts that were not only creative but containing other unique flavors. Mexican chocolate with horchata creme...yea, their own homemade horchata,not a tub filled with flavored gelatin goo   Apple fritter. Dark. Happen to notice this to as the tray containing the fritters all looked the same,over done. To their credit, the inside was not overdone and actually the best of the group of donuts I had.  In a nutshell, this is no O Face and probably never will be. I suppose this means I need to find something more on the level of my expectations. Which leads me to a final thought. Donuts that cost 2-4$ per should be on the level of artisanal. Otherwise, what am I paying for that I couldn't already get at Von's?",

The kids LOVED the donuts and the milk on tap! I had a hazelnut ice coffee, I saw someone on here with one.. it was delicious I wish I could go here everyday! It was PACKED that's how you know its about to be good! And we loved the little patio area in the back it was so cute and everyone was very friendly! We will def be going back!",

The person that took my order was helpful and her recommendations were excellent. She even up sold me on other donuts and coffee. The checkout was excruciating, I had to ask for my coffee. The coffee was spilled by the cashier.  The cashier forgot a whole box of donuts. Ultimately, I had to make a second trip which took an extra hour of travel time to retrieve my second box of donuts. The cashier mistake ruined my whole experience at donut bar.",

I tried the Sunday before last and missed out as I came too late, surprisingly 9:40 is too late even though they open at 8! This place is very popular. Unfortunately, you have to arrive super early to get a FT donut which they only serve on the weekends. I arrived last Saturday before the doors opened and it was well worth it! The donut was so soft and tasty, it went down smooth with the milk I ordered. I have to say it sucked sitting at the eating area as the air is blasting which made my French toast cool after a while. I only ordered the French Toast so I'm not sure about the rest of the donuts. I do plan on going back this weekend for another FT donut so maybe I'll try some others as well. The 4 stars is because I feel they should have the FT donut all week and because the hours they are open is so short, some days they close at noon. They could be making so much more business!",

The place is great easy to find especially with neon sign out side the door. Staff is awesome, ambience is great, , owners always there to great you and thank you with a friendly smile. The only problem I have with this place is that I don't know what Donut to choose, I go inn for one come out with half a dozen.  It's all good I can munch on them all day.

And fret not, if you're like me, they offer dairy alternatives, like soy!  they have an incredible selection of crazy awesome donuts and your basics that you love.

I thought the shell was too hard on the top. The mud pie donut was pretty good ! Had a hint of peanut butter & was covered in Oreos !!   The workers were super pleasant and friendly ! The price was very reasonable. My favorite was the outdoor patio in the back where you can sit and enjoy your donuts ! It was cute and quaint !

Well, I finally returned to sin city and was able to get my paws on one. The crunch was just as satisfying as I was hoping, but the donut was overall just ok. Totally worth the money, but surprisingly dry inside.   The filling is a custard, which helped the inside texture and kept he middle moist, but towards the sides, there was a staleness that was probably from the time of Day we went. I'm not sure how anyone wakes up before 10am after a night in Vegas, but if you're awake, I bet they are better.   The place is incredibly cute, they have a donut fish tank that was adorable and a bathroom with every donut lovers favorite Simpsons scene.

There location isn't too far from downtown Fremont and the Container Park, So this is alway a good option to come to first thing in the morning.  That's probably the best time to come in is early, they alway sell out fast and all the good options are gone if you decided to come in later in the day.   I have been lucky so far to alway grab my favorites before they sale out. My go-to's are alway the birthday Cake, the Homer, and a Nutella one. I even love the Churro Cone with Ice Cream.  My favorite time to come here is on the weekend. It should I say my little ones favorite time to come here is on Saturday or Sunday, they alway give out free donuts to kids. They make them a featured character and have it all decorated out.  Last time we came here and got our free donut they were handing out Ninjago Donuts, my son was super excited and absolutely went crazy with pure happiness. He has now made it a point to request we go there everyday, but unfortunately my metabolism won't be able to keep up with that request, so we opt for the weekends only lol.   If your lucky enough to come on happy hour you can grab a box full for $10, the only sad part is you don't know when they will have it or if they will. It's usually before they close and depending on how much they have left. So it's alway a win win when you come in, you can grab a speciality donut, or a free kids character donut, or a happy hour box.   Either way you will definitely not be displeased with the quality of the donuts, and you can always walk off the calories at Fremont or Container Park.",

    "text": "I eat approximately two donuts a year on average. Not really my thing. Someone brings in a box of donuts to work and I'm not even tempted. Bad for you and I just never find they are really very good.  On our trip to Vegas in April I was doing my research on Yelp and saw the rave reviews on Donut Bar. Heather and I decided to grab a coffee and wander over on our first slightly hungover morning in Sin City. Am I ever glad we did.  The donuts here are next level. So many tasty, colourful creations to choose from. We decided to share a Mexican Hot Chocolate Donut and a Maple Bacon Cinnamon Roll. Both were out of this world. The Donut was fresh and fluffy like nothing I had tried before. The chocolate and marshmallows were perfect. The Maple Bacon Cinnamon Roll stole the show however. The huge chunks of crispy bacon and the perfect blend of crunchy, chewy, sweet and gooey Cinnamon Roll made for an amazing morning treat I raved about all weekend.  A place you must stop in and try just blocks from Fremont Street!",

The crime brulee's was allegedly their number one seller, so I got one of those!  It was delicious but very sweet.

This location is in Down Town Vegas so it can be a little difficult to find if you've never been to DT. There is a parking lot across from it as well as meters near so that was a plus. As soon as you walk in you are face to face with all kinds of huge and pretty donuts! I came in specifically for the Big Poppa Tart. Which is a strawberry pop tart stuffed inside of a donut. It ended up being very overwhelmingly sweet but a fun donut idea overall. We bought an assortment of yeast raised donuts and cake ones to get an overall Donut Bar experience. The staff were very genuine and helpful.",

The cream brulee was a close second. The glazed sugar on top gives a perfectly satisfactory crack when hit and/or when bitten into and the filling was delicious.   We purposefully visited on the weekend for the expanded menu and, of the specials, chose the French toast donut which did not disappoint. We'll try the grilled cheese on a later visit. I suggest you do the same. (Or take enough people that you can order all the donuts and do a sampling.)   The staff was very friendly and the donuts, yummy!

On our first visit, we got here around 8am and there was a good amount of people in line to get donuts. They had everything from creative choices like their version of a Pop-Tart, a variety of sugary cartoon characters, jelly donuts and their take on the classic cake creations. The problem with going first thing in the morning is that your eyes are bigger than your stomach, and you end up ordering a ton. Totally worth it. Nothing beats remembering you have a box of these treats in your hotel room after a day of drinking, or whatever it is you do in Vegas.  If you come around 11am, which has been the case on most of our visits, they box up the remaining donuts from the morning and sell them for $10 a pop. You don't get to choose, but it's still a steal if you don't care which ones you get.  They also have variations of Stumptown Coffee if you need a caffeine boost. It's offered in hot and cold forms, but the cold brew is my favorite between the two, especially if you're going during the warmer months.  Plenty of metered parking on the street and behind the building in a shared lot. If you want to sit and eat, they have some counter space inside, and a shared outdoor area with some tables and chairs too.  Totally recommend if you haven't had a chance to check them out in San Diego. They're awesome!",

I would HIGHLY recommend you share a donut with a friend (or two) and not take one on yourself like I did.  Go early as they do sell out throughout the day. My first time here, I was browsing the huge selection but what caught my eye was PISTACHIO. All time favorite, had to try it - even if it was pistachio lemon. Boy was I impressed. The lemon flavor punches you in the face, but the pistachio caresses you and makes it all better. The balance of flavor they manage to pack into the donut is spectacular. The size is on the outrageous side, but it definitely makes it worth the price. Their coffee is also top notch and pairs well with any donut you decide to devour.  I would take visitors to town here, but I would hesitate on coming regularly. Although it's a damn good donut, my stomach would hate me.",

    "text": "Quite possibly the best donuts in Las Vegas. Donut Bar creates super fun & delicious donuts like their maple bacon bar, huge big papa tart or the creme brulee just to name a few. Make sure to come in early because they will sell out, FAST.   We've had their donuts in our office multiple times and they're always a nice tasty treat. My favorite is the PB&J. It has real peanut butter in it which I love & the dough tastes just like a cloud. I also have tried some of their coffee before. They use local brews like Vesta which I'm a fan of.   If you're a sweets lover this place is a must visit! Also a good hit for impressing your coworkers.",

Inside has limited seating.  Prices are decent for the style of donuts they have. Came in at 11:30 am on a Saturday and they had happy hour, fill a box with anything for $10. Literally 10 donuts for 10 bucks. Normally 10 donuts here would be close to $40-50.  Won't review each donut, All the donuts I got tasted like how they should. The dough was good and chewy. Sweet but nothing to bad where it hurts the teeth.   Big Poppa Tart - $5 - Huge jelly filled donut shaped like a pop tart.  Salted Caramel - $3 - Huge! Vanilla - $3 - Huge! Birthday Cake - $2 - Sprinkles! Boston Cream - $3 Peanut Butter & Jelly - $3 - My favorite! Creme Brulee - $3 Raspberry Cheesecake - $2 Nutella Overload - $4 Cinnamon Roll - $4  Sugar high!!!",

I was planning on getting a dozen for my co-workers, but they had no deals on buying in bulk - at least none that were offered to me.  The girl behind the counter said they are all individually priced no matter how many you buy, which is kind of ridiculous considering the most BASIC donuts are $2.  I ended up getting half dozen instead and just cut each one in half.  Luckily, my office isn't that big.  They looked beautiful, but not anywhere close to the best donut I've ever tasted.  I'd say 3/6 had the same flavour with different food colouring/decorations.  $18 for mediocre donuts....I'll stick with Glaze Donut from now on.",

Besides the wide variety of donuts, there are plenty of coffee options, a water station, and an outdoor seating area. Shop was clean, staff was friendly, and we got an incredible deal on a box of donuts as it was near closing time. Really enjoyed the smallish creme brulee donut. Pop tart donut was gimmicky, but had to try anyway. Fun place.",

I stumbled upon this location while looking for coffee options by our hotel and decided to walk to this place to check it out. I am glad I did coz the donut options are creative and just hands down delicious but not overly sweet where you don't taste the flavor other than sugar. To me the staff of this place took it to 5 star. We got the creme brulee and French toast donut at first and both were delicious specially the French toast was so fluffy soft.   Took the maple bacon cinnamon roll for the road and it was very tasty as well with good balance of sweet with bacon! They open early 7 am on weekdays and 8 am on weekends and close till they sell out which the staff said is around 1 pm.  If you're in Vegas then I highly recommend stopping by, we got here at 8:45 am and it  got busy with people coming in and out with pickups. They advertise with a #BestDonutsInTheWorld and I agree!",

They also have coffee and vegan versions.   It doesn't have official hours. It usually opens about 8 in the morning. They're only open until they sell out, which depending on how busy they are can be soon after they open. It's not a big place, and there's usually a line waiting out the door. The best thing you can do is get there soon after they open. I like the apple fritter. It's about $2 each. This is massive. It's crispy and not excessively sweet, and it goes good with coffee. This donut is also vegan. It usually has several vegan options. They also have donuts with Oreos and Twix bars in them.   It doesn't have that much room inside. It only has a few seats against the wall where you can use an outlet. There is a courtyard that's shared by Juice Stars.",

However I paid for parking to come here and get the Game of Thrones and Unicorn donuts plus ones for my kids like the strawberry split .  The female that helped me knew that I wanted donuts for pictures for things like yelp and my instagram but when she placed my unicorn in the box before I even left she let it get messed up .  Not to mention when she grabbed the unicorn that I picked she let sprinkles roll off. To say she didn't speak or even offer help in suggesting donuts is an understatement .  My Mom was asking about what bacon options they had and it really felt like she was a zombie that was not happy to be there . But I ended up asking if those cinnamon rolls in the back had bacon and my mom opted to pick that .  The donuts quality is still decent but  when  she had our donuts at the counter to pay we noticed the cinnamon roll with that she grabbed was burnt she wasn't wanting to put it back and couldn't even ask if my mom wanted something different like what in the world . Another employee chimes in to ask but again Hyleah is what I was told is the name of the girl helping us but the female who I asked said she's one of their friendliest employees if so you need to do work. The lady at the coffee place knew I was upset and didn't even apologize .  I paid to park to be treated like my $17 for the small amount of donuts wasn't good enough to even respect the fact I do not want them to look raggedy cause I legit am trying to promote you guys yet my unicorn got jacked up . She didn't ask which house I wanted on the game of thrones donut and she also gave me one that isn't that photo ready so sadly I will probably not be back to donut bar anytime soon.  I used to love this place but even when I tried to ask of that was the tip jar cause yes I still tipped The chick walked away ignoring me didn't thank me for coming and overall service was terrible and giving me non messed up or burnt donuts was the morning mood.  I suggest you work on treating customers especially your local ones better . Sorry if I typoed her name but I had to ask the chick at coffee for it .   You guys weren't even that busy I've been there and waited with much longer lines but your employee really hurt my feelings and killed my excitement for scoring a unicorn and game of thrones donut .  Overall I won't be back especially since my mom left with no donut because we didn't want to pay for a burnt one and the girl helping us didn't ask if she wanted something else it was the Asian chick at the coffee who even agreed to put it back .   Super sad to place this review but I even warned them while I was there that this wasn't the service I was used to plus she didn't even want to give us a li",

We tried a range of different ones, including maple bourbon, Homer, mud pie, and creme brulee.  Of these, one of the best was the Homer, despite the fact that it was huge and seemed likely just to be plain and sweet (and seemed more of a novelty and likely to be characterless).  The Homer actually had the best \"doughnut\" flavour with good fried-dough character and the icing was actually nice, not just plain sweet.  The creme brulee and maple bourbon just seemed bland and unexpectedly just sweet with little other character.  The mud pie was pretty good.    I'd try this again when in downtown Las Vegas but though it seems a worthy effort so far it is not nearly on the same level as other doughnut places I've been to.",

I hope they bring this a little closer to the strip because that would be a game changer. I went to brunch a couple of miles away from this location and thought - I'm on vacation ... I need donuts. This place did not disappoint. Make sure you get there early if you want a lot of options because this small joint is so popular that it sells out quickly. Oh and guess what ?!?! They have vegan donuts tooooooooo and a selection of coffee to pair your sweet donut with. I actually tried a cinnamon roll and it was the bomb dot com. Okay moment of truth, I actually ordered from here two more times during my stay from Uber Eats because they were just that good. And guess what else ?! My favorite donut actually turned out to be the began creme brulee!!! Please visit this place and try as many donuts as you can- you will leave stuffed but wanting more.",

They have made the top 10 donut establishments across the country.   When we arrived there was a line of patrons waiting and wanting to try these amazing delectable delights. There are so many to choose from. From Unicorn to  Peanut butter and Jelly.   Each is made fresh and they are differently priced.   Upon entering off of 6th and Carson entrance, you walk up and are quickly greeted by wonderful counter people. They have so many options and are willing to take their time with you. They have espresso and coffee options as well.   There is a small counter you can sit at, however seating is very limited.   I obviously got several to say the least. The owner is very personable as I got the chance to meet him today.  Pricing is a reflection of quality and presentation.   Would def recommend. Once everything sells out, they close- come early  Location is 6th/ Carson - parking is street or lots",

I went on a Monday around 11:45am and they only had $10 donut boxes aka happy hour. You select a box which contains 12 donuts; a great bargain and each box has a good selection. You just can't pick which donut goes in a box; staff already has them ready. It's a steal cause some of the specialty donuts like the Big Pappa Tart is $5.  If you're in Vegas it's worth a trip down to Donut Bar and you can take in the sights and sounds of Fremont St.  Delicious donuts, good coffee, clean interior and friendly staff makes me want to come back every time I visit Las Vegas.",

I hate the word Artisanal especially when it comes to donuts, but this place is pretty fancy as it comes to ingredients and style of donuts. Stump town coffee & yummy selections such as Nuttella donut with chopped hazelnuts on top. Maple bacon bar, the Homer for those of you that remember the Michael Jackson Simpsons episode! We paid $27 for 2 coffees, 1 bottle water & 7 fancy kine doughnuts! Yes, winchells or Krispy Kreme is like $6-8 for a dozen, but why do you hate yourself? Pay up and treat yourself!",

I have been looking forward to trying this place since it's opening and two times made the journey downtown from the west side of town to see a sold out sign.  This third time we came on a Monday a little past 10am and it was open.  First off location for me is not convenient so I really was expecting something mind blowing. Bummer that it wasn't the case.  I did appreciate the different variety of choices.  I went for Reese's peanut butter cup since chocolate cake donuts are my favorite and the pop tart donut.  The topping on the Reese's donut was great but the cake donut itself was blah.  This opinion from the girl who thinks pink box chocolate cake donut with chocolate frosting and coco Krispy on top is crack!  The donut didn't have much flavor   Kinda felt like is was just eating a Reese's peanut butter cup. The pop tart donut gave me a little more satisfying feeling but the inconsistency between the edges and the middle was a let down.  Wish the jelly filling was spread more evenly throughout rather than a bit splatter in the middle. In the end I'm very sorry to say I threw them away after a few bites each.  Anyone who knows how much I love donuts know that's shocking!  If I'm in the neighborhood I would give it one more try and try a few different types but definitely will not go out of my way again when pink box, Dunkin' Donuts and Winchells are within 2 miles from me.",

Unfortunately, the woman with blonde/brown curly hair in a ponytail in the front was so annoyed by me being there I literally didn't even have time to look at the donuts before rushing out a decision as she was wide eyeing and huffing at me. Granted for the first moment I was on the phone in order to VERIFY DONUT ORDERS for other people, god forbid I purchase more from them. To which I got quite the eye roll from the lady. If the donut I rushed out an answer to get because she made me so nervous to browse the selection as I had NEVER BEEN HERE before wasn't so good I would've given one star!!! There was one person in line in front of me it wasn't busy, so why seem so bothered to the point you're rolling your eyes at a customer because they aren't sure what they want. I've never been there how can I know if I don't have the chance to look with out being made to feel bad by their employee. I can't believe the customer service in Vegas is so poor when it's a customer service town. So disappointed at my experience here when I've heard so many good things, must've had bad luck and caught the wrong employee on the wrong day I suppose.",

Almost too overwhelming but I didn't let that stop me from trying a variety of things. There's maybe too many to list, but what definitely stood out was the French Toast Donut. It's only a weekend run but who really needs doughnuts 7 days a week ;) I did the FTD on a weekly routine for awhile with my bf. It came with hot Vermont maple syrup, whipped butter, and house made blueberry jam. It was usually big enough for me but he's a bigger guy and would also get the blueberry cheesecake donut which he said was the best sweet pastry hes ever had. In addition they also have homemade chocolate milk and cold brew on tap which alone is worth the trip. Awesome friendly staff and a quick in and out experience. I suggest you get here before the donuts run out",

But tasting the donuts I was thoroughly disappointed.  Overly sweet, monotone flavors presented in shoddy mass production bakery style formulas. An appeal to hype and popularity if this place has succeeded in anything, it's Marketing. After dropping nearly 40 bucks on a dozen donuts I didn't find a single one that I liked. The Nutella donut was filled with just straight Nutella. Greasy heavy and totally inappropriate mouthfeel for a donut. Would it have been so difficult to whip the Nutella into a Bavarian creme? Lazy patisserie commanding astronomical prices.",

    "text": "While I applaud their marketing strategy (Large 'Sold Out' sign in the window makes one wonder what they've missed out on and make an effort to come back and see) to say I've had better donuts is an understatement.   Getting there early one is greeted by rows of elegant looking donuts with creative names and flavors and a helpful staff.  Donuts aren't cheap but not as expensive as some have complained about ($5.00 for 2 - what do you expect for the \"Best Donuts In the World\").  I opted for a creme brulee donut for the BF and a (huge) Mud Pie one for me.  My friend got a Boston Creme for herself.   As soon as she took a bite of the Boston Creme I knew this was not the \"Best Donut In The World\" entirely too doughy not enough creme.  Creme didn't go all the way through the bar.   My Mud Pie tasted like a donut with chocolate sprinkles.  Fancy name for a less than average donut.  Again the thing was HUGE which meant a lot of dough for not nearly enough topping.  I ate about half and got bored (BORED! With a donut!!!)  The BF's review was the worst.  He took one bite and said it was the worst donut he'd ever had and that the cooking oil needed to be changed (he works in the food industry and I don't so he is more aware of such things).  He refused to eat any more (however, helpfully offered me a bite - which I declined).  He puts the creme brulee as \"worse than Dunkin' Donuts\" which is about as low as it goes in his book.   Maybe I don't have the refined donut palette of some of the other clientele, maybe I'm just looking for something different in my breakfast pastries.  But I will skip this one next time.",

Now, I may be biased as I am a hardcore Simpson's fan and the shop paid homage to Mr. Donut (Homer Simpson), but the donuts we had were truly delicious without being an overly heavy donut. Which was good seeing as how it was 112 degrees out.   The creme brulee was fantastic, only to be trumped by the chocolate espresso donut. Loved it. Thanks Donut Bar!!!",

    "text": "Man oh man can you drop a pretty penny here. Donuts start at $3 and go up to $6! Watch out for those pricey ones though, they're monsters..  I believe between four friends, we ordered to our hearts content (which ended up being 8 donuts and about $35, including chocolate milk for all). They supposedly have homemade strawberry milk on tap but I have my doubts since they were sold out the last two times I tried to stop in. (Maybe the trick is to go early? But how do I know the strawberry milk is worth getting up at 7am???)  In any case, the donuts were magic. I highly recommend the creme brulee donut since it was one of the more unique ones we had. Personally, not my favorite. The caramelization on top tasted more like honey to me than anything else but I still recommend giving it a go since I've never seen anything like it anywhere else. Also the big poppa tart donuts are INSANE. Way too much volume for my belly. It was tasty but hard to enjoy such a monstrosity. I ended up taking two-thirds of it home. We also tried the strawberry split though I wasn't all that impressed. It's a sugar donut with whipped cream and strawberries in it.. plain and simple. There are definitely better options here, in my opinion..  If I were to offer a few pieces of advice: stick to the classics (they do their simple donuts very VERY well) and GO EARLY TO GET THE STRAWBERRY MILK. I think it's one of those mystical menu items that may or may not exist in real life.. hmm...",

I came in around 11 AM on a Monday, and they still had quite a selection left to choose from. It's a cute shop with a nice outdoor section to enjoy your donuts, too. The music is a bit loud inside. The staff is friendly and helpful; I asked a few questions, and they were happy to help me pick out my donuts.   The only donuts I really enjoyed and would probably come back for are the creme brulee, Homer's donut, and the \"Oh My Birthday Cake Oreo.\" I didn't get to try the strawberry split I was also interested in, but maybe that will be for another visit.   Not a bad experience at all, just a little bit less than what I was expecting.",

The place is pretty tiny, and the line can be confusing since they have two front doors and don't specify which you should enter from to get in line. I've seen some shade thrown over people jumping ahead in line because they came in the out door. For future reference, it's the easternmost door.   They have a good concept with keeping limited hours, and closing when they sell out.

Assistance hand over balloon to kids.  Then they start serving you.    You get in the shop and welcomed with smile and amazing smell of fresh donuts, cream and coffee.

It was huge!  My husband got the Expresso Chocolate and my chocoholic friend went for the Triple Chocolate Threat after being disappointed that they didn't have the Chocolate Euphoria today.  Theirs were both cake donuts and we felt they weren't anything too special.  My friend commented the Chocolate Threat was not even Chocolatey enough and I agree.  I came here for the Strawberry and I was not disappointed.  The donut is bit crusty like a croissant.  I would prefer like a soft donut but my husband and friend enjoyed the \"crust\" the way it was.  My husband also commented that it reminded him of a Chinese birthday cake.  I felt satisfied with what I had been waiting for....months or years...",

I was there around 7:45a and there were still about 20 people in line ahead of me. Get there early because they close once they sell out.  They post their menu for the following day on Instagram. I decided before I got there that I was going  to get the Creme Brulee donut. I promised myself I was only getting 1. I lied. I left with 6.  I did get my Creme Brulee, but I also got a Vanilla Bean Glazed, Strawberry Poppa Tart, Twix, a Maple Bar, & Cake Batter. It was around $20. I seriously ate nothing but Donuts all day. And, they were huge, fresh, & delicious. Completely worth getting up early, driving across town, and paying too much for!  I already have my next must try flavors picked out. Caramelized Pineapple, S'mores Poppa Tart, Banana Caramel, Samoa, Apple Fritter, & Blood Orange.  Best Donuts in Las Vegas!! A MUST TRY!!",

The blueberry was ok and the smores one was WAY too sweet, like eat one bite and get diabetes sweet. Creme Brule is a good idea but that sugar coat on top makes for difficult chewing.  Their apple fritter was actually pretty bad. I took a bite and threw it away, had a burnt quality to it. Personally, I enjoy donuts with a glaze AND something on top or filled. Most of these are plain donuts with something on top.  I wanted to love this place. I was there at their grand opening and even met the owner. But I couldn't love it, only like certain things. That being said, their french toast donut is amazing as well as their churro donut ice cream cone. Both of those things along with their strawberry pop tart are worth it.",

Walking in the doors I was greeted and I immediately diverted my attention to the array of donuts waiting for me to eat! I did not know what to choose and I couldn't just get 1 so I got 3! Creme Brulee, Strawberry Cheesecake and the Birthday Cake Oreo! The Creme Brulee had all the components of what you're used to, it's a bit dry but once you get to the filling, it just makes it all so much better. You bite into it and you hear that nice sugar cracking and then there's no going back. The Strawberry Cheesecake was my favorite out of the 3 because it was just so creamy and just perfect! It tasted like I was eating a cheesecake and once I had the first taste of filling, I just couldn't stop. The Oreo Birthday Cake was a great combination as well, it had a bit too much frosting for my taste but overall was a good one too!",

    "text": "Well I'm on a donut review writing spree right now, so I may as well write about one of my top 3 donut places in Las Vegas.   I dare say Donut Bar actually makes my top 3 donut places in North America too!  (The other two being Blue Star donuts in Portland and Cartems Donuterie in Vancouver Canada)  Why is Donut Bar so darn good?  Donut standards keep going up, and these days, you can't just have a good donut.  You need something that stands out to make your donut shop - 'worth a journey'.  At Donut bar, they've got TWO things that I gladly journey out for - their ice cream donut, and their creme brulee donut.  That's not even mentioning their other donuts (strawberry, vanilla bean, maple bacon) that are full of flavourful donuty goodness and excellent in their own right.    Unlike Pinkbox, Donut bar closes when they run out of donuts.  That's usually around noon?  Depending on how picky you are about your donut options, come early.  They only make about 25 of their ice cream donuts every day, and they usually aim to have those ready by 10.  I know eating an ice cream cone at 10am in the morning feels a little strange, but it was worth it for me.  I haven't had their horchata donut, but I've seen photos -- looks pretty amazing.  As soon as I lose my donut weight I'm going right back to hunt for this donut!",

The coffee drinks were fabulous, the staff were so friendly and the bathroom, well, I'll leave it as a secret and just tell you to check it out! Will be back before I leave this town. GO. SEE.

So good! I also got a creamy chai latte made almond milk, yes they have ALMOND milk, and stumptown coffee! They also have coffee brew on tap and I'm pretty sure they serve alcohol. They also have the option of putting frozen yogurt on your donuts. Wow! Try it!   Uber Eats delivers from there and they have been featured on many food websites such as Food Network, Thrillist, and Forbes Magazine. Eat up!",

I'd say its pretty pricey for some donuts but it's so worth it. They even ask for your name to put on the box so that makes me felt a little special.   The staff is friendly and energized which is great for the downtown area. The drinks look amazing but I decided to get a simple strawberry milk and chocolate milk, which complemented the donuts even more. I'll definitely be coming back here.   Some tips I'd recommend  - Get there early preferably in the morning because they do sell till they run out of donuts. - If its a nice day I'd recommend eating outside in the back because it has a nice feel to it.  - Always get a drink even if its just milk!",

The large ones are truly huge and easily split-able, which is great for trying multiple with friends.  I tasted 3 \"small\" donuts: toasted coconut, creme brule, and nutella explosion. They were all great - loved their consistency and Donut Bar's playfulness with the decorations.  To top it office, the prices were great! Totally reasonable for a \"craze\" food, quality, and quantity.  What a food adventure! Definitely check this spot out.",

As tempting as that was, I opted for their other end of day special - 2 donuts for $5.   The pop tart donut was really like a pop tart...donut. it was so good! That fruity jelly on the inside. Frosting on top. I had no regrets eating this. Well, it was way too big so I only ate a quarter of it. Share.   The Apple donut was good even though I ate it the next day! Mind blown. That means they fried it well because usually poorly fried donuts are soggy the next day.   I love this place so much I even bought their shirt...Donut kill my vibe!",

My comrade and I picked up three donuts to sop up what was left of our Fat Tuesday drinks marinating in our digestive tracts.   We picked up two giant donuts (one birthday cake and the other nutella) and one regular sized (strawberry shortcake). For me, the star was the strawberry shortcake. It's like one of those ice cream bars you'd eat as a kid (who am I kidding? I eat them as an adult too) but in donut form.  It's the cake donut type but it's all pinkish due to the strawberries in the donut. Yes. PLEASE.   The larger donuts we got were the yeast type donuts. Both tasted the same except for the toppings. One was topped with frosting and sprinkles (that tastes like the canned frosting, yum) and the other nutella. Both delicious and easy to share between three people.   I'm already yearning for these when I come back.",

We ordered the big vanilla donut and a apple cake donut or apple crumb donuts sorry and another cake batter doughnut. They all had phenomenal flavor and we're not your normal donut. If you're looking for a new spot then you should make sure to try this one.  Apparently there is a grilled cheese donut you can try, I think if I knew that I would try it again.",

Great flavor. Fresh. Not just a typical donut and they seemed set apart.   We've been I think 3 or 4 times as we come back and visit vegas.   This trip we made the haul all the way from the other end of the strip to get some donuts for our few days stay. We got 6 - yes 6 big donuts. Unfortunately this time we were pretty disappointed. It seems they've changed something and the donuts are more cakey like, seem less fresh and the flavors just aren't there. They have the options of flavors but the best part about the donuts this time was things they didn't make: Nutella inside, Oreos on top, etc. The donuts weren't bad they just didn't seem as set apart and special or worth the hike from the other end of the strip. Not sure if we'd go back or venture to other donut places on the strip next time.",

    "text": "I have a love/hate relationship with Donut Bar. Unquestionably, the donuts are good. Are they worth $5 a piece? Definitely not.   Donut Bar has an excellent variety and without a doubt grade A marketing. I'll literally be scrolling through Instagram, see a photo of their donuts, and instantly begin prioritizing my need to drive all the way downtown to pick up a French Toast donut.   In comparison to other donut shops throughout the valley, Donut Bar offers a variety of vegan donuts, made to order options, and some very \"creative\" choices- such as the \"Big Poppa tart\", a donut literally stuffed with a pop tart. As for the quality- arguable. Yes, they open super early and obviously if you get there later in the day they won't be as \"fresh\"- but hey, if I'm getting a \"stale\" donut it seems obscure to pay $4 or $5 for it. Definitely think they need a price adjustment.   Flavor is a 10/10. In all the times I've been to donut bar I can honestly say I've never not loved the taste of any of their donuts. My most favorite would have to be the strawberry shortcake and the Oreo birthday cake- both absolutely delicious!   The employees are also very kind and are very quick to give recommendations. I've been here super early at opening to when they were just about sold out and have always experienced exceptional service.   Overall, Donut Bar is great- I'd just recommend an early arrival and preparation to pay upwards of $30 for a half dozen donuts.",

    "text": "There is a reason why Donut Bar was voted best donut in Las Vegas let alone in the country by numerous sites.  Donut Bar has a wide variety of donuts that can meet everyone's needs.  All of their donuts are made to perfection.  They are light, fluffy, gooey, and any other adjective you can think of.  The french toast donut is the go to donut.  Just imagine a massive circular french toast covered in powered sugar and then the drizzle of the warm maple syrup.  Other donuts to consider would be the Big Pappa Donut which has a whole pop tart inside the donut!  This thing weights 1lb!  Next you have to get the creme brulee donut which is a soft yeast round filled with creme brulee and topped with caramelized sugar!  The next must have would be the Oh My Birthday Cake Oreo which is Birthday Cake Oreo stuffed donut topped with cake batter glaze, pastel sequins, and cookie crumbs.  This place is also very welcoming.  The staff is super friendly and the head Chef Jeff is one of the nicest people you will ever meet!  So, if you are in Vegas and you are craving Donuts and coffee (They Serve Nitro Cold Brew Too) stop by Donut Bar!  Donut miss out!  BrandonFitFoodie",

In SD, I had the Strawberry Split (an unforgettable fruity donut stuffed with whipped cream, $4) and I was pleased to see it again here in Vegas. But on this trip I had to try something new.  On this Saturday morning we got there pretty late, around 10:30am, and it seemed like a lot had already been sold.  Of what remained, I had two donuts: Creme Brulee ($2) & the Twix donut ($2).  I gotta say, both Donuts were unlike anything I've ever had before. The brulee had a sweet sticky crunch layer of molten sugar and filled on the inside with sweet cream. I knew going into the Twix I would be smacked with an explosion of chocolate and it did not disappoint - Twix bar crumbs covered the top layer of thick chocolate dressing on chocolate dough.  Amazing!  For your coffee craving, there're several options to choose: espresso, mocha, chai latte, drip, etc.  I had the Americano - a super smooth black coffee.  Plans for my next visit, try two new donuts, try the drip coffee, and ARRIVE EARLY!!!",

It's a cozy little bar with stylish furniture. I recommend those visiting here to try this place out for breakfast, just expect nothing but donuts and coffee/alcohol.",

    "text": "Stopped here last weekend while visiting Las Vegas. Because of the reviews, I made my husband stop by. First of all, they have many different creative ideas (as far as shape and flavor). Secondly, the donuts were fresh!  Third, the staff was nice and friendly and seemed like they liked their jobs. We purchased the creme brulee, red velvet, and blueberry cheesecake donuts. I think what is special about this place is the different types/styles of donuts. I thought the donut fishtank was cute too!!  I also liked the \"barstyle\" set up (bar table/stools) they have there. The one in San Diego serves beer so I think as this Vegas location grows they should serve different items to stay competitive. The hours are from 8-1 pm on the weekdays and 8-12 on the weekends because it is said they sell out of all of the donuts by those times, however, there were many donuts available around 11:30 am last Sunday when we were there, so I don't understand that statement. No different than other donut shop as far as taste goes but will be back again when in the Fremont district.",

There were people eating at table's in an open air type patio which reminded me of San Fran. I heard loud music, saw an incredible fish tank, and had to check it out. Shocked to find it was a donut shop since it seemed to be \"hip\". Didn't know such a thing existed.  Wasn't hungry, but I wasn't going to leave without trying one of their many unique donuts. Crazy combinations. Poptart inside a donut? Who'd of thunk? I got the Strawberry  Shortcake, or was it Strawberry Shortpuff, as it was loaded with whipped deliciousness topped with strawberries. Spent 10 minutes in bathroom taking photos. Check this place out! Must pay for parking, but no big deal. Machines take all forms of payment. Worth it.",

    "text": "Adorable place, with fantastic donuts.  The creative donuts here are the reasons why I wanted to give this place a try.  It's like a new wave going on with donut chains popping up in cities.  I feel a little bad for the mom and pop shops, they're going to have to step up their game.  It's one thing to have cute and creative donuts but the most important part is that it has to taste good as well.    I wanted to try the pretzel shape donut, but I didn't see it when I got there, so the the worker told me about a french toast donut that was made fresh.  It took about several minutes to make, and it tasted just like what it was called a, \"French Toast Donut\".  It was literally a french toast donut.  I also ordered the bitrhday donut with oreo inside and a glazed buttermilk for my boyfriend. All the donuts we ordered exceeded or expectations.  I can't wait to come back next time, and hopefully get my hands on the pretzel donut.  *When you're there don't forget to check out their incredible aquarium created by the guys from TANKED.",

Not only are there numerous options of delicate, savory donuts-- but the staff and chef always make you feel special when you walk through the door. I would recommend the French toast donut. So soft, crunchy and delicious that it melts in your mouth. Served warm directly to you with syrup and butter. I call it the triple B: buttery, beautiful and breakfast donut! The times I've visited Chef Jeff welcomes me and recommends options-- he treats everyone the same and makes your visit special. Great place for healthy gains  and not so healthy gains -- but let's face it? Donut calories do not count because they are at Donut Bar. Great place for indulging and calming your sweet tooth.",

They all sounded DELICIOUS!!!! We tried the Big Poppa Tart, the cinnamon roll bacon, blueberry Meyer lemon, banana Carmel, creme Brulee , chocolate euphoria, maple bacon and the pumpkin French toast donut.  Oh, and the Strawberry Split Donut too.  Now you are probably wondering if I ate them all, and the answer is yes, or at least a sampling of them. We brought the goods back to the hotel. We used Uber to get there from The Ventician, and it. The cost of Uber was around 12 dollars roundtrip.  Let's just say there was not one donut in the three boxes we got that wasn't super yummy!!! My favorite was the cinnamon roll and bacon. So much bacon on it and in it too. I found a couple of strips of bacon ribboned through the roll. Best part is that i checked in on Yelp and got a great cup of coffee to with my donuts.  Also, note the owner will be on Tanked on November 18th too. If you ever make it to Vegas checkout The Donut Bar you won't be sorry!!!",

When I say patient, I am referring to the fact it is extremely difficult to decide what to get.   Since the last time I was there, they have made what seem to be \"giant\" donuts.  Believe me I wanted the giant blood red orange donut!  However, I picked the strawberry cheese cake and a creme brulee.  I really liked the strawberry cheesecake donut even though I thought it should be called a strawberry filled donut more than anything.  The creme brulee donut had outstanding filling!  It was a delicious decadence.  I wasn't into the top of the donut but I haven't had much exposure to creme brulee.    Just to mention, I have also had their vegan donuts and loved them as well.  I had the vegan donut when I had company in town and bought a dozen for everyone.  It was a bit of sticker shock when the dozen cost me $23 but when you eat the donuts you understand you are getting \"every penny's worth.\"   Overall, I would have to say these donuts taste as if they were cooked with care and pride in craftsmanship. They are worth the drive when you have a donut craving that won't go away and demands gourmet taste.",

She had emailed them in the beginning of the year and didn't get a response. I had to stop there when I was in Las Vegas to personally get information about what we wanted. They took my information and then I followed up with them to get the figures. After getting that squared away I was told to get them paid for about 2-3 weeks prior to the event. I emailed them to have someone call me to take payment, no response, then called today to give them my card and the person on the phone was authorized to do so and he person that was wasn't available for about 3 hours. I left my name and number for them to call me back and never did. By far the worst customer service I've seen in a while when a person is trying to \"give\" you money. I wouldn't recommend using Donut Bar to cater any event in fear of them not getting back to you when time is of the essence.",

Their regular Donuts are so good and so fluffy I've never had a fluffier donut.....and on the weekends they have free donuts for kids and they also make French toast donuts made to order... What.

    "text": "Located in downtown Las Vegas near Fremont Street, this donut shop is cranking out the most mouth watering, unique donuts I have come across!  Walking into the shop you can smell the coffee and the donuts being freshly baked. The donuts are displayed behind a glass from almost top to bottom and all look amazing. There is a little sign that tells you all of the flavors - there are a lot! The service here is great and they answer all your questions for you and are also REALLY patient - since there are so many options it is definitely hard to choose just a few.   - Creme Brulee Donut - THIS IS A MUST GET! The crack of the hard sugar shell and the custard on the inside all inside a soft donut.. yes, please. ($2) This is a little bit smaller than some of the other selections, but you do not need much since it is very sweet and rich. - French Toast Donut - another favorite, light, airy, and the perfect balance between a donut & french toast. Also comes with syrup, butter, and jam ($5) - Birthday Oreo - A birthday cake donut with an oreo inside - this is the same size as the creme brulee donut - Caramel Latte Donut - This one is huge! The frosting is exactly like a caramel latte - Big Poppa Tart Donut - ALSO HUGE! Looks just like a huge pop tart and has strawberry filling on the inside.  - Burning S'more (or something to that name?) - looked fancy and tasted like a fancy s'more. If you like s'mores, you'll like this.   Serve Stumptown coffee here and make great Americanos. All our donuts and our coffee cost about $28 (this includes tax and tip) and we got two of each of the creme brulee and birthday donuts. The smaller donuts are less expensive and the bigger more expensive, but totally worth the splurge (might as well on donuts instead of losing it gambling, right?)  Can't wait to come back!",

I've been waiting for this place to open for quite some time now. I've been stalking them on social media and you have to pay attention so you don't miss out - you snooze, you lose!  I got a few doughnuts: Caramelized Pineapple, Caramel Latte, Red Velvet, Big Poppa Tart, Samoa, Homer, Apple Fritter, Mexican Hot Chocolate, Nutella, Maple Bacon, Banana Caramel, and Cinnamon Sugar. They're most famous for Homer, Big Poppa Tart, Strawberry Split, and doughnut ice cream cones. I would have to try the Strawberry Split, Creme Brulee, and doughnut ice cream come at a later date as they weren't available/ran out.   But what I like the most from the ones I did get include Caramelized Pineapple, Mexican Hot Chocolate (sweet, cinnamony...then a spicy note. Yum!), Banana Caramel...Nutella was ok.  They have Stumptown coffee, puppy treats, and milk. My pup, Ralf absolutely loved the puppy cookies I got him.   Welcome to Vegas!",

The size of some of the donut choices are huge and could feed a small family. I ate my first round of donuts there at the shop and of course had to go for round two but got those to go. The service there is fantastic and the employees there are all very friendly. They treated the tourist folks with the same amount of respect as they did to the local regulars that came in. Will definetly be returning when I'm back in Vegas.",

    "text": "Overall, a decent donut shop with a friendly staff.  Below is a breakdown of all the donuts I tried...  Strawberry Split: vegan! The fresh strawberries are a great contrast to the cream & fried donut. I wish the cream wasn't made from soy but I guess you can't be worried about GMOs at a donut shop lol  Blueberry with Meyer lemon icing: reminds me of a blueberry muffin topped with lemon frosting. Not as good as the blueberry donuts from M&M Donuts in Orange County but still good.   Red velvet: I would have personally liked it a little softer, but overall, I can't complain. Not bad, but not anything that I'd rave about.   Salted caramel: just really HUGE, but average tasting  Oreo birthday cake:  For your sweet tooth, this donut tastes just like the name. More like dessert than a breakfast food, but I guess that's True of most of these donuts. Props on creativity!  Creme brulee: delicious & vegan! I just wish the hard caramel on top was a little thinner because it can overpower the yummy donut with creme filling a bit.   Strawberry big poppa tart: A pop tart inside a donut made to look like a huge pop tart. Probably the most unique donut here. I'm not a huge fan of pop tarts but this pop tart hits the spot!  If you want to be able to choose from all of their options, I suggest coming before 10am. I came at 10:30am & they had already run out of a couple things. If you come when they are almost done, like 12:30pm, you'll only have maple bars & salted caramel donuts to choose from; however, you can buy a box full of these donuts for $10 at that time.",

On Sunday I was finally downtown doing one of my make my own food crawls and knew I needed to stop in.  We were warmly greeted right away by the employees and the delicious looking donuts. :) Since we were doing a food crawl we narrowed to two donuts, but we were offered some free donuts and who can pass on free donuts? I'm glad that I was able to try several flavors and get a good idea of what they offer.   The apple donut was my favorite. It had a nice spice cake flavor with small chunks of apple in the cake and a nice glaze on top. The chai donut was unique and also hit the spot. The birthday cake donut had Oreo in the center and was tasty as well. The vanilla was my friend's favorite and while simple, I loved this one as well. The chocolate fritter was less moist than the other donuts and had a nice flavor, but wasn't my favorite of the bunch. Overall, nice texture and awesome flavor for the donuts.  We also enjoyed some of the delicious Stumptown coffee. Stumptown is always delicious and quality coffee is always good with a donut. I also tried the Nitro brew which was bold and perfect with the sweet donuts.  The employees were very friendly and generous in making sure we were able to try as much as possible during our visit. I love visiting a local business where I can feel the pride in the business. It's cool to have another business join what is becoming a pretty cool downtown Las Vegas.",

Not positive about this because I never went to O-face. Anyways the original location of Donut Bar is from San Diego, really glad they brought  it to downtown Las Vegas.    I have to say I was pretty impressed, they had Stumptown coffee! I am a bit of a coffee snob and Stumptown coffee has got to be my favorite. They serve Stumptown at the famous Voodoo Doughnuts in Seattle/Portland area to give you a better idea of how serious this coffee is. The outdoor patio seating behind Donut bar is also on point! Very spacious and surrounded by artwork. However, the customer service was a bit lacking to me. I felt pretty rushed to order by the girl behind the counter. She almost seemed annoyed that we didn't automatically know what we wanted to order.   Pros: vegan options, outdoor patio seating, Stumptown coffee, cool bathroom decor, amazing coffee selection (nitro cold brew coffee on tap), location   Cons: Small space (wouldn't like dining inside), really loud music for early morning, close at 1 pm or until all sold out, have to pay for parking (only a $1 but still), customer service   Vegan donuts you must try: Banana Caramel, Strawberry split, Creme Brule    Tip** for every dozen donuts you buy, you get 1 free.    All in all, pretty cool addition to the downtown Las Vegas area. Definitely recommend people to go check out this mouth watering new donut shop!",

I came in around 11 AM during their soft opening and there were quite a few good choices left. Unfortunately the strawberry split & Oreo one was sold out  but that's okay because what I got was tasty!   Donut Bar compared to other donut shops around town is their HUGE donuts ($4 each), and unique ones like the Oreo inside the donut, the pop tart inside the donut, and hopefully the donut cones soon (well that's what they advertised on their Instagram). The dough is exceptionally chewy, moist, the toppings are even & proportionate, and most importantly the frosting isn't overly sweet.   I definitely recommend this place, just come early so you have more options!",

    "text": "I love the size of these donuts!  For donut fanatics like me, it is a glimpse of nirvana to see a giant fresh donut with delectable toppings.  And the variety!  So much to choose from, I get paralyzed when I want it all.  I can't decide!  And kudos to them for not serving all cake donuts, which is what many bakeries do so that they can stack multiple toppings and glazes on top without them losing their shape.  Nope, Donut Bar serves nicely soft, huge yeast donuts, which is comparatively rare.  And yummier :-)  I chose the Brad Fritter with bacon and caramel, a blueberry cheesecake filled, and a lemon pistachio \"glazed\" yeast donut (small tire sized).  Took me 2 days to finish them, such is my gluttony.   They serve a nice assortment of caffeinated drinks to wash them down.  Not a whole lot of sit down space, but that's the only shortcoming really.  Worth the walk.",

I wish they had better vegan selection (ie: simple options like glazed, eclair, sprinkle, etc)  If they had better vegan options I would frequent this location weekly, for sure. I've only seen the vegan sprinkled donut on 2 occasions. So far the strawberry split & sprinkled is my fav",

    "text": "Donuts. On. Steroids. I mean massive!  Walked in on Tuesday morning around 11:50 with a friend with the understanding that all the good donuts would be picked over. Wasn't wrong about that one, except that they had what both of us came in for. I was shocked to here that they did sell out 70% or something like that of the flavors... I saw plenty to choose from. The employee helping us was warm and was happy to help us with our selections.   I chose the birthday cake donut with sprinkles because, duh. But also because it was of normal donut size. My second choice would have been the homer but I had errands to run and didn't want to leave the donut in my car in warm weather. My friend chose a chocolate donut. The big kind and he got through half. I ordered a glass of milk while he ordered a coffee. In regards to my donut, I wasn't blown away. It isn't the best I've had because I've had really great, moist donuts that taste extremely fresh, but there's no reason I wouldn't return to Donut Bar for more donuts. It's the first donut shop I've tried since I've been out here so my next couple visits will be in comparison to Donut Bar. I do appreciate the uniqueness they bring to something so classic, I was told they had donuts with a pop tart inside. I got cavities just thinking about it, but innovative concept to say the least. Attractive frosting and designs but traditional as far as donuts are concerned.   It was a fabulous day out, a cool off after a hot couple of days. We were happy to find we could sit outside where there is a communal patio of the neighboring shops. It's clean and inviting, likely bustling in the warmer weather. I appreciated the art work on the buildings as well.   I had intended to eat my donut and go back in to order a couple for others. To our surprise in 20 minutes 90% of their stock we walked into had vanished. No they had not put them away, they sold them! I was told they sell out daily! I think there's benefits to showing up fashionably late around the time they close (1p) - you get a bargain! Selection is sparse though at that point - you've been warned.   Shout out to the bathroom - Homer Simpson, Family Guy art, loved it! Also loved the merch though I didn't purchase. Street parking is readily available around the block and you are in super close proximity to Fremont Experience for you tourists.   I'll be heading back to try new flavors!",

When we arrived we were greeted by all their friendly staff.  The ladies also asked if my children wanted to take a complimentary cookie monster donut.  They gave us one for each of my kids. I thought that was very sweet of them. They even went the extra mile to give my kids each a balloon. We ordered a french toast donut, nutella filled donut, the birthday oreo donut, and maple bacon donut. Let me tell you these donuts were so delicious. I honestly could not stop smiling they were so good! I would have given them a 5 star just based on their friendliness, caring, welcoming service. This donut shop is by far my favorite just by one visit. Thank you!!",

Pros: fantastic service - staff were friendly and   knowledgeable Cute shop - set up/ decor Ginormous donuts and vegan choices Free Jiggly puff donut for my son Vegan apple fritter was yummy  Cons: Aside from the apple fritter the donuts were just ok. For the elaborate toppings the actual donuts were alright, nothing special. Price varies per donut...I paid $18 for 6 donuts ( vegan: 2 creme brulee, 1 strawberry split, 1 apple fritter, 1 cake batter, 1 chocolate euphoria, and a free Jigglypuff donut) Music was a bit loud and it made it hard to hear donut descriptions and specials from the staff  Had this place bookmarked for a while and decided to try it out.  Apple fritter was good...probably only donut I would go back for.",

I've already started making a list of friends and family that are coming to town so that I can bring them here too (and hopefully have a little more control and spread out the donuts that I want to try).   This place is super clean, cute, and we saw both of the owners in on a Saturday morning making the french toast donuts and handing out drinks at the counter. That is one of the greatest things to me to see because it shows me that they're really here and really passionate about their business and I am so excited to go back and support them again and again.   Parking is very available near here, with both street parking and a pay-to-park lot directly across the street. When you enter, you are immediately greeted by so many donut options that you will feel a little overwhelmed (so many choices) but don't worry, your donut guide will be with you shortly and will help you pick a great one.   I chose the big poppa tart, a donut the size of 2 long johns, filled with a pop tart and jam, and topped with pop tart crumbles and frosting. It was awesome. The donut was super puffy and flakey and even before getting to the pop tart middle, tasted exactly like a pop tart. Next time I really want to try the strawberry split or the french toast donut (which is made to order and served warm).   I honestly can't wait to go back. This is a great little local place that is fun for both locals and tourists alike. Just make sure you get up early; when they sell out for the day, they close!",

Each donut had a nice bite to it & the texture of the donuts ranged from light & fluffy to dense & thick. Some of our favorites were definitely the creme brulee (it has a crunchy top!), strawberry cream cheese, old fashion, & maple bacon.   They have many specialty donuts that's it's hard to keep track of them! S'mores, Mexican hot chocolate, red velvet, blueberry lemon.. even some filled with pop tarts in them! It was so crazy to see! Also some of their donuts are HUGE. There was no way we could finish all 26 donuts in a decent amount of time before they got stale haha.   The place was also easy to find. Located by Fremont street. There is an arrow neon sign that you can't miss. Downside is you have to pay for parking, but if you're there early enough you can park for free. Will definitely be back for the donuts we didn't get to try yet. Especially their French toast donuts that they only serve in Sunday's!",

Today's visit I got a mud pie, lemon pistachio, and cake batter.  The lemon pistachio was refreshing.  The glaze was light and just tart enough.  It had a sprinkling of pistachios.  Perfect balance.  The mud pie was chocolaty deliciousness.  I didn't try the cake batter but it did look yummy.  I recommend Donut Bar for a sweet treat.

For example, the Nutella was basically just like a chocolate glazed. It was good though. We also felt rushed and pushed down the line. I felt like i didn't even get to look at all the choices because of that. If you want to sit and eat there, they do have seating outside. I loved the outside sitting area. Very cute and peaceful.",

It's small inside and you go in and get in line to order. I got 2 creme brulee donuts and I also got the Nutella donut. The Nutella donut was $4 and the creme brulee was $2. Definitely reasonable prices. I would have to say I love love love the creme brulee donut. It's my favorite and I loved the Nutella one too but creme brulee definitely has my heart. I will definitely come back here for sure.",

    "text": "I like donuts and am always willing to try out different donut shops/bars, especially ones out of state. Las Vegas' Donut Bar is located in downtown, which is a bit out of the way if you stayed along The Strip. We ended up getting a Lyft there one morning for a quick bite to eat.  If you follow them on Instagram, they post their menu daily. I was really looking forward to getting the strawberry split donut, however when we arrived - they were all out. Go early so you won't be disappointed like me. We ended up getting:  Ohh My Birthday Cake Oreo ($2) Creme Brulee ($2) Caramel Latte ($3) Maple Bourbon ($3)  Caramel Latte tasted a lot like coffee and we had a hard time finishing it. Same with the Maple Bourbon. Amongst the 3 of us, we demolished the smaller ones (Creme Brulee & Birthday Cake) but had to take the other two larger donuts (Caramel Latte & Maple Bourbon) back to the hotel. Their donuts are HUGE. It's kind of hard to try all the donuts unless you're with a group. I didn't really care for the Birthday Cake one. It tasted like a funfetti cake that had an oreo inside. At least it was small so we were able to finish. By the time I tried Maple Bourbon, I was already too full and on a sugar high. That was enough donuts for me.  My favorites were the Creme Brulee and Caramel Latte, mainly because I love those flavors in general. Mmmmm the Creme Brulee was delicious with its crisp outer caramelized crust and custard filling on the inside. If I had known any better, I would have ordered a dozen of these and called it a day. Next time I'm in Vegas I already know what to get & hopefully they will have my strawberry split then....",

The interesting thing is that their hours say an opening time, but instead of a closing time it says they close whenever they sell out of product for the day. That ensures they are fresh everyday and don't sell day old donuts. It's a small shop, and can get pretty hectic when it's breakfast or lunch time, so prepare to wait in line. Donuts were very moist and full of flavor.",

It is like their basic donut recipe is so good that whatever they do after that is just an enhancement on perfection!  My absolute favorite is the oreo stuffed donut-my mouth is watering remembering the last time I had one.  The Poppa Tart is so unique and delicious and I am thinking it is made to be shared but....ya know...sometimes it just has to be hidden from your family and eaten bit by bit all day long :-)    My first experience with the donut bar was their happy hour; they were close to closing time and did a happy hour where an entire box of donuts was $10.  We had no idea the joy we were about to experience.  Since that day I often drive by the donut bar hoping to catch another happy hour but it seems like they are often sold out by the time I come by.  Next week I plan to make a special trip for the weekend French toast donut, you can bet I will go early for that one!  Overall the donut bar is outstanding with a friendly and comfortable ambiance.  I highly recommend this place.",

I got a whole bunch of nutella donuts, a few creme brulee, an apple fritter, and a couple of birthday cake donuts.  Let me put it this way, the ones that I liked were definitely the smaller ones to an extent.  The nutella donuts(large) were borderline tasteless.  Too much bread, fairly dry.  The creme brulee was definitely tasteless.  The cookies and creme b-day cake was fine.  The best one, and the most expensive of the bunch I bought, was the nutella(small).  That had some flavor and was just right.  Not too much bread and just the right amount of nutella.  I paid $36 in total for a dozen and I now realize that getting there early is more than enough to get what I wanted.  I probably won't come here again, but it is a decent novelty donut shop.",

I came here with my mom and little brother to come enjoy something different for breakfast. Immediately we were greeted by a friendly gal that told us about the best donuts and recommended her favorites. I can't remember the names but we had a strawberry whipped cream, Nutella filled, and red velvet. My favorite was definitely the strawberry donut. The whipped cream is soy-based and the donut was so light. Definitely looks lighter than it is! The outside is super cute with lots of seating and artwork. I can't wait to come back and try some other delicious treats.",

They have a great variety of donuts and unique flavors like creme brulee. We got the blueberry lemon cake donut and the creme brulee donut. The creme brulee donut had a bruleed sugar top and a vanilla pastry cream filling. It was amazing! The donut was a perfect fluffy texture, and the filing was very creamy, and the bruleed sugar had a nice crunch. The blueberry lemon donut was great as well. I find that sometimes cake donuts can be dense, but this one was perfectly fluffy and had the perfect amount of icing on the top, so it was not overly sweet and sugary. To top it off, their bathroom has the cutest murals of Homer Simpson and his pink sprinkle donut!",

I ordered 3 donuts. The creme brulee donut, Oreo birthday donut, and cheesecake donut with a strawberry like filling . Each were good not great. The sugar crust on the creme brulee donut was executed nicely. The filling on the creme brulee donut was subtly sweet it felt more of like an eclair texture than a donut. Somehow it seemed like the donuts were not fresh? Which is weird because they always sell out and they had to be made that day. I also ordered a cold brew coffee which was okay. They have other specialty donuts like the huge pop tart donut. And peanut butter jelly donuts . Overall this place is okay. Seems more like a hyped fad- like place. There are many dessert like places in Las Vegas this doesn't stand out from the rest.",

The cream center is made in house and the crunchy sugar top makes this donut turkey something special! The vanilla bean was good so was the strawberry shortcake. They are huge but nothing to special. Atmosphere is great and the staff are wonderful!",

    "text": "As a donut lover, I researched the best donut places in Las Vegas before flying in for my first trip. According to reviews and social media this seemed to be the place to go.  My friends and I woke up early on a Sunday morning and took an Uber to the bakery. When we got there it wasn't crowded at all and we spent time looking over the menu trying to decide what we wanted. Thanks to the pictures I saw on Instagram, the French Toast donut and Strawberry Split donut seemed to be must haves. Along with those I got a vanilla bean glazed, a Nutella filled and a cheesecake filled donut. Go hard or go home right?  The strawberry split was my favorite hands down and I'd go back for that alone. The French toast was made to order and served hot with syrup, jam and butter. Easily a second favorite. The other 3 were okay and kinda let me down. The nutella and cheesecake filled were both good but did NOT have enough filling...I felt like I bit through 3/4 of the doughnut before I tasted filling. The vanilla bean glaze was also okay. However, there are so many delicious looking donuts available that I'd definitely go back to try something new along with my favorites.  Props to Donut Bar for having a back patio where you can sit and enjoy all your donuts. The morning we went there was plenty of seating available. If you love donuts like me, definitely make this a stop on your next trip to Vegas.",

    "text": "Having jury duty earlier this month allowed me to drop by Donut Bar for two days straight.  First visit-11:30am...choosing from what was left, I tried a Strawberry Cheesecake and a Boston Creme. Both tasted okay, but the chocolate glaze on the boston creme wasn't only excessively sweet but looked dull, not shiny like other donut shops, and the dough part itself was a little more dense for my liking.  Gave Donut Bar the benefit of the doubt and decided to catch them earlier the next day.  Second visit-7:30am...arriving with a full display, I perused the list and ordered three types of cake donuts: Matcha, Blueberry Meyer Lemon, and The Samoa. I also ordered a Creme Brulee Donut and their special donut of the day, Strawberries and Cream. Best of the batch was the Creme Brulee Donut and the Strawberries and Cream not far behind. The yeast raised donut items here aren't as light and fluffy, but more dense and are alot darker than other shops around town. The cake donuts sound better than they actually tasted and I just took one bite of each and couldn't get passed how DRY each of them were. Couldn't taste matcha or meyer lemon, but sugary sweet(and I got there half an hour after they opened)  Service was okay,  and price point is kinda iffy with the fact that there are other shops in town that charge less for a better tasting product that won't leave you with buyers remorse. Like that song goes, \"I'm a classic man\"...I like classic style donuts that light and fluffy,  and  aren't hidden by thick glazes and don't need  the addition of an oreo or pop tart. To me, less is more, and maybe third time's the charm, but for now,  I'm in no hurry to rush back.  ALOHA!!!  Shaka Meter:  \\uuu/  \\uuu/  \\uu. 2.5",

The staff is friendly when ordering donuts. We also enjoy the back area for sitting and talking. My last visit ended with an unpleasant encounter and now I am not sure how I feel about visiting again. Everything was good until we were about to leave. My sister and I had our kids with us and we decided to go out in the back to eat donuts. When we went out we noticed they had gotten some corn hole boards and some other customers were enjoying them. My sister's kids played with them for a little at one point but for the most part stayed by us. As we were leaving our group was approached by an employee who asked our kids in an accusing manner what happened to the corn hole board. When we explained that others were playing with them and the kids said they didn't do it he continued to accuse them of damaging them and then proceeded to lay a guilt trip on the kids. First, if you think someone's kids did something you should approach the parents and speak with them so we can handle it. Second, if you don't have proof or a witness accusing someone is wrong. He never said he had proof or a witness...if he had we would have handled it appropriately and the kids would have been held responsible. Like I said at the start normal our visits are great and we love introducing people to the donut bar and love their treats...now I am a little put off by this last visit due to this employee.",

So~ when my friend went to Vegas, I made him bring home a dozen for me. Little did I know, a dozen would actually be 2 big boxes! It was totally worth making him lug it around though. Because these donuts were so bomb! We do not have anything like these in Philly. I mean a donut with a poptart in it?!   Anyways, after cutting a piece of each flavor to taste them, I ended up freezing them because I couldn't possibly eat them all in one sitting, well I could, but I decided I shouldn't. Well let me tell you, have any of you guys tried frozen donuts before? It was probably even better than when I tried it fresh! How could that be possible?! Well some of the donuts were too sweet when I had it fresh (the poptart one especially) and when it was frozen it was the perfect amount of sweetness.   I still dream of eating these donuts. I need to make a trip to Vegas.",

It's located about a block away from Freemont East on Carson and 6th Street and, without the flying pink donut on the wall outside, I might have missed it. Before walking in, you'll notice the posted hours for each day - they close when they sell out - so it's probably better arrive earlier than later.  We ordered four cinnamon rolls, two strawberry cheesecake donuts, a slated carmel and a Homer. I almost went into a diabetic coma because I couldn't stop and they were gone too soon. Each one was distinctive in taste but not overly sweet or dry. My favorite were the cinnamon rolls, they were gooey in the center and melted in my mouth, I highly reccommend them!",

For $16 we got four donuts and two drip coffees.    $4.00 \"big poppa tart\" is a ginormous donut which looks like a poptart on the top.  You need a fork and knife for this!  It's kinda greasy but fluffy and filled with a generic cheap-tasting  jam.    $3.00 \"DB's nutella donut\" is a standard donut with chocolate on top and what I think was crushed nuts.  It was fluffy, huge, and nicely yeasty.  It didn't taste much like Nutella to me.   $4.00 \"strawberry split\" is a huge donut dusted in sugar, split down the middle, and filled with cream and fresh strawberries.  The donut itself was kinda boring but the strawberries were ripe and juicy.  The cream they use is the super-white kind that never melts....kinda like the type they use on the desserts at Golden Corral.  It doesn't taste good and I'm sure it's not good for you.  I'd pass on this one next time, even though it's very pretty.    $3.00 \"Pb & J\" is a vegan jelly-filled donut with peanut butter glaze on top.  My husband really liked this one.    They gave my son a free donut...it was a round one with a red face on it...maybe it's a character from a cartoon or something?  I'm not sure cuz' my son is two and hasn't started watching TV yet.  It was a very nice gesture on their part!  We both got drip coffees which were actually good but they only had regular sugar, sugar in the raw, and stevia.  Gimme some splenda or nutrasweet, ya hippies!!!  Let me kill myself slowly with artificial sweeteners.    Usually donuts give me heartburn but I felt fine all day after gorging myself on these donuts.  I'll be back to try the creme brulee donut!  This place will definitely do well because they are catering to the hipster vegans and they have unique donuts.   I had a lot of leftovers since the donuts are so big but they ended up in the trash...which means they weren't very good because I will gladly eat a krispy kreme donut that is 4 days old that i found on the ground somewhere.",

    "text": "Thanks to Danny N. of West Covina, CA for giving me the 411 on this Hot and New business in Downtown Las Vegas!  We don't have these fancy 6 inch donuts in Hawaii, so it was a fun discovery for me!  We arrived at about 9am and the line was out the door, but it moved quickly since the workers are efficient, skilled, and friendly!  We easily found metered street parking right in the front of the shop on Carson Avenue.  I ran right in and was done before the meter maid caught me!  Oh yeah for \"free parking\"!  Donut Bar is a cozy place where the width of the shop showcases their eye-popping product.  There's a row of stools along the counter on the far wall if you want to dine there.    The colors, designs, and names of the donuts really intrigued me. It was so difficult to make a decision, but I finally settled on the Caramelized pineapple and the Coconut Dream. ..  I'm from the Aloha State and I haven't seen a pineapple donut before.  Mmm mmm... it was a delight!  The Coconut Dream was even better because it reminded me of a Mounds candy with a thin layer of chocolate between the donut and the coconut layer.  Yummy! Both donuts were $3 each. They did leave an oily spot on the wax paper that lined the box... and a bit of an oily feel in the mouth.  The donut itself seemed a bit denser and less cakey in texture.    I want to go back for the Mexican Hot Chocolate, creme brulee, chocolate bacon, and the Strawberry Split. .. (note: vegan options are available!)   I heard that there is a Donut Bar in San Diego. .. oh oh...here we come!",

    "text": "Maybe it's because we came later in the day (around 11:30 am) that I wasn't really as impressed as I thought I would be because I had a limited selection.   The staff was super nice! She immediately welcomed us as soon as we walked in. We were staring at the menu for quite some time and she remained super helpful, offering descriptions and suggestions.    JUST AN FYI, just like most donut shops, they will run out of certain donuts so definitely show up early if you want a certain type that may be popular on their menu aka the creme brulee donut. But I don't regret what I got! I went with the red velvet donut and the db Nutella! The red velvet was not bad! It wasn't too sweet so it's not too overwhelming to be considered a meal on its own. The only thing was with the latter was that I felt as though there was too much bread with the donut to Nutella ratio but maybe because the donut itself was HUGE.   I've heard plenty of amazing things about the Donut Bar. Prior to their opening, they already had so much hype, so much talk of people lining up at their door. But personally, I thought they were OOOOKAY. Probably will give them another try when I'm in the area.",

Past times I have been able to try their specialty, the Pop Tart doughnut. This thing is 1lb! So tasty and big enough to share (if you're feeling generous!)   The staff is very friendly as well.

    "text": "So I've been here three times now and like a fine wine, it just keeps getting better with every passing day.  The Donut Bar has been killing it since day one here in Vegas, by staying True to classic fried delights of my childhood, but also upgrading a few of the sprinkled covered favorites. I've tried good portion of the offerings here, but the real standouts for me are the coconut covered donut, The Old fashioned, the peanut butter chocolate, the Pop-Tart donut, and a classic pink frosted donut simply dubbed, \"The Homer\".  Every bite is soft; flavor packed and melts in your mouth. The icing on all of these gorgeous bakery beauties is made in house along all the donut fillings, no store bought stuff here. This process of making in everything in-house really helps to keep the quality on point; three visits later and the donuts have the same mouthwatering consistency. I will keep traveling here for these amazing donuts all the way from Henderson which wasn't the case for O' Face, R.I.P. Sorry, but a dry donut that's lavender and lemon flavored just wasn't for me, especially when they cost close $6 a piece.   If you simply can't decide on what calorie bombs to order, just have the people behind the counter put together a half  for you, trust me it will be amazing. Don't forget the coffee, they have Stumptown Nitro Brew on tap along with chocolate and strawberry milk being tapped daily as well. That's enough right there to visit this place.   Donuts. Just do it!",

    "text": "Loved this little spot!  Went for lunch with a co-worker after seeing a photo of a donut from this place on unlokt. Apparently, it used to be O Face Donuts and looks the same inside. I never visited when it was O Face but I'm glad I did visit this time!  I went with the ginormous blueberry donut and it was delish! Co-worker went with the one stuffed with the Oreo cookie. I tried both and I think the Oreo stuffed one was a little better but any donut the size of the one I got gets bonus points for 'more to love.'   The guy who helped us was super friendly and told us we had to stop back in the morning to see their full display of goodies. By lunch time, they have a smaller selection remaining but I still felt like the 10-12 left were plenty to choose from. Also, at this time of day it was buy one, get one. I love a discount so that was huge for me.   Next time, I'll try the one with the pop tart inside. I punked out this visit because I was trying to eat slightly less than a zillion calories of possible but next time I'm going for the gusto!   Final thought: my donut was a little dry but the icing was great. As of my first visit, they didn't steal my heart for best donut in town. But I'm definitely going to give them another shot.   I say go give them a try!",

    "text": "Everyone jumped on the hype train when this place first opened and took over the old O Face Doughnuts location. My first run-in with Donut Bar was when I lived in San Diego in 2013. They were one of the first West Coast shops to try to emulate the cronut, which at the time, had just been invented by Dominique Ansel and was an overnight sensation. Donut Bar's Gaslamp location was very much like this one. There were huge lines that stretched out the door in the morning and they were often sold out by midday. In fact, I never did get to try one of their cronuts or \"cro-bars,\" rather.   Flash forward three years and once again Donut Bar is the darling of the donut world and selling out on a daily basis by 1 pm. I've visited this location twice now (but really once because one time it was sold out), and I'm still unconvinced that the majority of these doughnuts are that spectacular. For the most part, the novelty is the large size, especially the Big Poppa Tart, but I felt sick trying to finish an entire one myself. This fact holds True for most of the other large, yeast doughnuts as well, all priced $3-4.  However, the one doughnut that I felt was unique enough to return here for was the creme brulee. The caramelized sugar topping has that deeply satisfying crack when broken in half and the filling flavor is completely on par with that of a vanilla creme brulee. It's advertised as vegan and also only $2.   Overall, I wasn't impressed by the size or price. The yeast donuts turned dense if you didn't get them fresh. But highlights include the can't miss creme brulee donuts and Stumptown coffee (which just so happens to be my favorite coffee).",

They're of the same quality as any supermarket bakery so I don't think they warrant the \"world's best donut\" title, which I was disappointed about. The prices are reasonable, and the staff did an excellent job at serving the line quickly. I can see it getting chaotic as the line grows in the small place but the staff manages it well. The actual space is cute with a nice courtyard outside for extra seating. I probably wouldn't stop here again as there are places that I've had better donuts but for the time being it was a fun place to stop.",

I recommend sharing, even though I didn't because I have a problem with not sharing donuts, but you certainly can share this and be satisfied.

We are donut people and this place did not disappoint. We got there early, probably 5 minutes after they opened and they already had about 10 people ahead of us. The staff moved quick and were very friendly. The donuts were all fresh, and we were surprised at how big they all were. You certainly get your money's worth. I tried the French toast donut which is made to order, as well as the cake batter donut and they both were amazing! I think they both still would've been amazing even if I weren't 7 months pregnant lol. My fiance tried the \"big poppa tart\" and the lemon cheesecake. He was surely satisfied! We will definitely be back!",

The owner of the Vegas location was so nice, and he was helping his employees serve donuts to the customers which was awesome. The people who I was with got a cake batter donut and a regular cinnamon sugar one, and I tried a few bites of theres, and they were amazing! I live in LA, and I hope they will open one (or many)  there ASAP, because it would be wildly successful, and I would eat there a ton. Until then, I will be coming back to this location and all the others and getting new donuts. I heard the poptart donut there is the most popular, and I think they ran out, but I hope to try that next time.",

I came for the highly recommended apple donut or fritter as it is actually referred to in Canada. It was nice and there was a good amount of glaze to batter.

    "text": "Hello, My name is Scott Bianchi, and I have a donut problem.        I'm a huge fan of the Donut Bar in San Diego. They have great donuts, they have great people. It's a good place. When I heard they were opening a store in Las Vegas, I was jealous of Las Vegas. They're supposed to open a store in Santa Clarita. However, when I suddenly planned a trip out to Las Vegas, I knew a stop here was primary on my list.      Saturday morning I woke up early. Having been to the San Diego location, I know there's a line a block and a half long Saturday mornings.  However, when my WAZE lady told me I had arrived at the Las Vegas store, there was no huge line. There wasn't even people out the door. It seemed fairly quiet. There was also a parking issue.       The lot directly across the street has signage all over it saying 'permit required' and 'we will tow your car' so when I parked in it initially, I was a bit concerned for my ride. I poked my head in the door of the Donut shop, and asked about it. The nice guy behind the counter said that the lot didn't belong to them, but there was free parking on sixth street on the weekend. So I ran back out, and relocated my car to the warm and fuzzy, safe free parking area just down the street. I then returned, knowing that I could sit for a lil while and have my ride be there when I left.      I entered the shop, and the familiar donuts smiled up at me from their case. They were holiday decorated even. I walked down the case and picked out four donuts.  I was going to stop at three, but then the rudolph donut just had to go along too. So, I paid for the four donuts (ended up at about twenty dollars) I then sat down to admire the donuts, and the fish tank from the fish tank tv show when I heard somebody order a french toast donut.     \"French toast donut?\" I asked, still composing my yelp photo.     \"Yes, we have them on Saturdays and Sundays...\"     \"I loooove the french toast donuts. I want one.\"     \"Excellent!\"    I paid for a french toast donut, and sadly put the lid back onto the box of donuts I had. I sipped on the juice I had also paid for. After a lil while, another donut box was brought out. This one had a plate and containers inside. Atop the plate was a french toast donut. In the containers were toppings. One had maple butter, one had jam, and the third had maple syrup.       I've never been a syrup kinda guy, so I put that one aside. The butter I smeared on top of the donut, and the jam I also used. There was also a plastic fork and knife wrapped up in a napkin. I used them to surgically cut apart my breakfast and enjoy it as long as I could. It was good. After this french toast donut, I was actually pretty full. So I thanked the store for their tasty treats, and walked back to my car.           It turns out they're a just block away from old Fremont street. So knowing my car was in a safe spot, I spent several hours wandering the area. Lots of very neat things to see right around here. Including 'old' Las Vegas, and container park with their colossal mantis. (Just in case you're looking for things to do around here)     The four donuts actually went home with me. They were still tasty and fresh when I got home the following day.",

    "text": "What a beautiful donut shop- shop is an understatement. It's a glamorous display of gluten-laden deep-fried sugar-coated creatively crafted creations that just don't seem to be fairly priced! Those babies should cost at least 50% more!  The intense labor and attention to detail explains the wicked narrow window of when it is open... I empathize with the time demands and being a slave to crafting such treats, so it's cool to limit hours. Otherwise, they would sacrifice worker sanity, donut quality and artistic freedom to the confines of clock time.  Anyhow.... they have vegan donuts. I repeat, they have vegan donuts. Not the kind that you see and think, \"oh, those are the vegan ones.\" Oh no, you wouldn't even care they are vegan or even know the difference, dear donut aficionados!  Though Judy there one day, of the 4 vegan choices, 3 looked amazingly divine, and all looked just like the rest! Strawberry split?! Apple fritter?! Creme brulee?! Who doesn't want those if you are going to eat a gluten-laden donut?!  Truly beautiful donuts! I also love that they have some esteemed coffee here to compliment the divine donuts. Stumptown, baby!  The line is long but worth the wait. Everyone is happy here- from staff to customers. The decor has an old-fashioned feeling to harken back to days when people didn't care about carbs as bad for the diet and brain? I love that they put your treats in an open box until they ring you up on the register.  A must try if you eat donuts with gluten- truly beautiful artistic creations. You'll be so happy!",

Admittedly, we were running late and I knew I was risking what they'd have available. I love the French toast donut. By the time we walked in, I was told they'd sold out already. Fine, I get it. I ordered another donut and it was fine. But, as I turn around the corner, I see two young ladies being handed French toast donuts by the manager(?). I looked at it to make sure and he looks at me and said, \"you should try one.\" My response: I just tried but was told you're sold out. He panicked cuz he knew he'd been caught and tried to cover his ass by saying they were out of the regular and the ladies were given the option of another version. Yeah? Where was my option? Oh, that's right, I don't have tits and wasn't offered the same options. And the cherry on top, we're local, which means I'll be telling my clients, whatever you do, don't go to the Donut Bar. Nice doing business with y'all.",

    "text": "I would leave 5 stars if I could, but since my friend pre-ordered two dozen and picked up for me I cannot comment on the physical location or the staff. I can say that my friend had no issues placing his the order or picking it up in the morning.  Forgive me for not knowing exact amounts but there were a lot of the matcha green tea cake donuts, several blueberry lemon cake donuts, and some raspberry pistachio yeast donuts. I was most excited for the matcha donuts because I'm obsessed with matcha. This donut was an absolute success, it made the perfect cake donut. It was sweet but not overly so and the matcha flavor was prominent without being overbearing. I loved the texture of it as a cake donut, definitely could have eaten twenty more of these.  I then tried the raspberry pistachio yeast donut which was as big as my face. Seriously, the thing was HUGE! I'm generally not a fan of yeast donuts because they lack flavor, this yeast donut however had the perfect fluffy texture and was buttery. the raspberry pistachio icing was incredible as well, slightly tart but mostly sweet with subtle hints of pistachio. It melted in my mouth with each bite, I was sad but very full when it was all over.  I really want to go back to try their creme brulee donut, as well as any others they're offering. I'm reading reviews about their donuts being dry but I didn't have that experience at all. I think Donut Bar's donuts are way better than the donuts O-Face used to sell. I'm hoping when I can check out the physical location I can update my review to 5 stars.",

None of them stood out as delicious, and the dough that they use for their donuts is too dense for me. Most of them were too sweet as well. If you come here, I just recommend getting the Creme brulee donut so you can record a video to make your friends jealous. The donut itself was overly sweet.",

I work within walking distance and deiced to give it a try this past Thursday.  The donut was okay but not near one of the best I've ever had.  The prices are crazy high for a single donut and I do not think you get a discount on a dozen.  I guess overpriced donuts are the current trend and people have no problem paying between $2 and $4 per donut.  I had a strawberry frosted donut at $3 and it was just okay and nothing special.  I think the Donut Bar opens a little late at 7:00 and misses the people that want to pickup donuts before going into the office.  I usually go to Real Donuts or Pink Box Donuts and both places are open very early.  I probably will not go back as I'm content with run of the mill donuts from the other places I listed above.    I will say the staff at the Donut Bar is very friendly and welcoming.  They greet eat each customer when arriving and offer to answer any questions.",

The interior design around the restaurants suits it well.  The donuts weren't as good as I expected. I got the Creme Brulee donut which wasn't very good. It tasted cold because it had been left out throughout the morning. I thought it would be warm and fluffy, but it was cold and tasteless. I really did try to like it because I heard so many great things about this place! Maybe I went during the wrong time, but I am willing to give this place another chance (donut wise)!",

I wasn't very happy but for the price, it was $1 per donut approximately. None of the donuts were that good, just taste like a regular mom and pop kind of place.   I also got a Nitro infused coffee because the guy recommended me as something new to try. Pricey and wasn't worth it. The coffee was SOUR! I'm not sure if it's supposed to taste that way... I mean if you really put your mind to it, you might find it drinkable. I'm a huge coffee lover and it hardly got me to finish half after an hour of walking around downtown.

I spoke with the manager and they didn't realize the demand for vegan donuts out here, and will be adding more once they open. Overall, very good but you do have to get there early for the best selection. Looking forward to trying more donuts from here... And I think this will be a very good replacement (possibly better) than O Face. I miss O Face donuts, so I'm hoping to get a chance to try the rest of their vegan donut flavors in the future.",

The creme brulee is a hit that's for sure, but the Oreo birthday cake, maple bacon, and red velvet donuts are also bangin. Get there before 10am and you'll have more options as they do sell out as the day rolls by.",

The location wasn't up and running yet but we were still invited in, I believe his name was Dan and Amy. They were both so friendly! Showed us around even gave us a box of delicious donuts to take with us! Mmmmmm maple bacon! If you're looking for a great place run by friendly people this is it!",
