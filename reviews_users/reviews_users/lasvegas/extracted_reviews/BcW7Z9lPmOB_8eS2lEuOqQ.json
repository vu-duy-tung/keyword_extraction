I wouln't have minded the prices at all if the food had been good, but as it was, only the sushi tasted fresh. We had a skewer combo that left us very underwhelmed & scallop lettuce wraps that were not wraps at all, just scallops & shitake mushrooms with burned garlic on top of lettuce scraps. Spend another 20 bucks extra somewhere else, I do not recommend this place. PS: the music was too loud",

And so I came across Musashi and decided to give it a try.   We didn't do the teppanyaki, as I prefer other places. Just ordered off the sushi menu.(Either Geisha House is great!)   I can't say any of the food was bad @ Musashi, but I just didn't care for the place. Felt a little dirty, I wasn't offered a sake menu, the server was nice but WAY to chatty. I just did not want share my life story with or hear his for that matter!  Good location, and they are open late, but so are a lot of places in Vegas.   Not sure why it has so many stars from other but, to each his own!",

    "text": "I can't write enough good things about this place.   I've only had experience with the tepenyaki part of this restaurant, but it's good enough to keep me going back to this place at least once a week.   The service is always great, as is the atmosphere. All the tepenyaki chefs are welcoming and have a great energy, making your meal more enjoyable. Young is the best, in my opinion, so if you can get him, you're golden.   The place is always packed when I go which is a double edged sword. On one hand, it shows that they are a great restaurant with a lot of loyal customers. on the other hand - sometimes it's too busy for me to get seated right away.   Tepenyaki - for those who don't know - is where they seat you around a grill, and the chef cooks your food right in front of you. At Musashi - with your tepenyaki meal, you get fried rice, vegetables, your meat choice, as well as soup. Each chef also makes their own unique sauces to accompany the meal. It's a great value, and the best place to get tepenyaki in Vegas.   I almost didn't want to write a review on this place, because I want to keep it all to myself. But, alas, one can't be greedy when it comes to sharing great places to eat. Eat here, and you won't regret it.   Highly recommended !!!",

They prices a what you would expect of a typical high end teppanyaki and they have a Kobe Beef option that I unfortunately wasn't able to partake (maybe if I hit it big at the tables I might come back lol)  The chefs from what I could tell, not including our table, was very entertaining.  Which is kinda of a hit and miss when you go to other teppanyaki places.  Only low point would had to be was that we had a reservation, and still had a 30 - 40 minute wait on top.  But it was worth the wait!",

Prices were fair and service top notch.  If you ask for Tigers table you can expect some funny but R rated humor to accompany the dinner service which the locals seemed to absolutely love.

Both were very flavorful n cooked perfectly, especially the chicken which in that scenario can be easily over cooked if the chef isn't careful. Loved the garlic sauce. All of them were good, including the hot sauce. And Call me cheesey but I liked the show. Our chef was funny and entertaining. Kept us laughing the whole time. The birthday girl really enjoyed herself...It was a bit pricey n weird that rice was a separate charge. Most Asian places whether it be Japanese, Korean, Chinese, etc...it's part of the meal and that's why I'm giving them 4 stars instead of 5.",

Our chef's name was Joan (sp?), and he was awesome!!! So friendly and funny. Our party had 10 people total, including one child and another minor, and he balanced the conversation and focus very well.   Not to mention the food was stellar! I had low expectations because I'd been to Benihana before, and that experience definitely paled in comparison, both in showmanship and in cuisine. I always thought teppanyaki was more about the show than about the food, as oxymoronic as that sounds. Joan proved me wrong! The fried rice was absolutely delicious, the shrimp and chicken I ordered were juicy and flavorful, and the sauces he created were out of this world! I'm drooling at the mere memory...  I wanted to lick my plate before we left. Seriously. The next time I go to Vegas, Musashi will be at the top of my list!",

    "text": "Today i was in the mood to go eat shabu-shabu. So since I didn't know of any good places here in las vegas, I of course had to do my research. I actually first looked up on citysearch to only discover that there were only very few places in Vegas that  served shabu-shabu. So I read my reviews and compared the ratings. ( I base my judgement on the majority of positive votes and also making sure the reviews stood on genuine and honest answers, since I tend to stray away from overly opinionated reviews where I feel that it almost leans on a more negative and very personal scale ) So i came across Musashi ..and I said \"why not\".   So read the menu and their specials which goes during certain times of the day and since it was early I would be able to make it to the lunch menu. I was totally convinced and gung-ho about my shabu-shabu all until i finished reading the menu.  which i found pretty impressive because it was very extensive. So I ended up changing my mind and went for the teppanyaki menu instead. So I arrive there and I am seated to the teppanyaki table, and there was already a party group seated, mind you I am alone and the chef greets everyone and is very friendly. The people actually at the table were pretty friendly too and happened to be local regulars also.  I order the New york steak well done with shrimp ( $17 ) that includes your soup, fried rice and veggies.. and that offer goes until 3 p.m.  As the chef cooks he was very entertaining and his stories were just as entertaining also, just the way I like it. =)  He kept making and suggesting all these different sauces to go with your meals and I tell you they were so so sooo good.  In the end there were about 7 different sauces to go with my food. My favorite one was the sesame with lemon..it was fantastic! The steak came out tender and just-right, the fried rice was amazing and balanced, the shrimp was wonderful, the veggies weren't overcooked, I enjoyed every bite and morsel, all and in between the variations of sauces. I ate up every single thing on my plate.  What also  made it such a great experience for my first time visit was that there were many laughs shared. The chef and the party made me feel comfortable too. Its always nice to know there are genuine people out there and especially when they are grouped together. I had such a wonderful and great experience with the staff, the customers, and my food.. So of course, with my research, I pat myself on the back cause I've done my homework well and by also completing a very satisfied appetite. I am definitely going back and trying other things on the menu. This time I'm bringing in my husband and our friends. Spreading the word about this wonderful place.  * Very satisfied customer indeed * yay! =)",

    "text": "The low down is this place has excellent sushi for a reasonable price and the late night menu is greatest draw with its long hours and half off prices. Read on if you want to know more...  THIS IS THE REVIEW YOU WANT TO READ!! First let me start by saying that this place and Ichiza are my 2 favorite sushi places in town and this review is worth the read if your planning on getting sushi here. I have eaten here countless times for late night sushi over the last year usually 1-2 times a week. They have amazing prices for their late night menu which is active from 11pm till 4am EVERYDAY! I go here for the happy hour plain and simple. I have never tried the teppanyaki side of the place. I have been when the place is busy and over half full and I have been when I was the only group there. In my many visits I have had a few long waits for food and check but they have been few and far between. Just like any other place they can get busy or be understaffed and its easy to forget that they also have to serve the teppanyaki side of the restaurant which can sometimes lead to waiting. The service has always been good and I have never had a rude server for any of my visits. The sushi chef's here are very consistent and it is always enjoyable. Once again like any other place it can have its off days with the sushi as well. I am pleased to report that 95% of the time I greatly enjoy the sushi and the 5% that I did not greatly enjoy the sushi it is still good and well worth the price. As I have said the late night menu is excellent for the price which I will now explain further to give you a grasp of the bill you should expect. The happy hour menu is loosely half off all items listed (this is to say a $7 roll might be $3.50 or it may be $4). If you like sushi as much as I do then you can leave like a overstuffed thanksgiving turkey with a very decent variety or rolls and appetizers for about $20 a person. The late night menu has roughly 30 food items on it with the majority priced under $5 per order. The sushi chef's here are willing to make what you want almost anyway you want it. If a roll you like isn't on the menu ask about it and if they can make it then will! If you want a roll fried just ask and chances are they will fry it for you. Overall the place is great and I love it there. I would recommend it to any friend with the same word I have written here.  My happy hour order consistently contains the following rolls and I suggest them to if you don't know what you want. The Ninja roll is my all time favorite (spicy tuna roll that has been breaded and fried). The regular Spicy Tuna roll is always great. For the fans of not spicy things the Christian roll and Washington rolls are excellent choice! If your looking for something that will have you think \"Refreshing\" order the Alaskan roll.  Thank you for reading my review over and if you try this place out I hope you enjoy it as much as I do!",

    "text": "Been here twice and both times were nice.  Did my 21st birthday dinner here and it was good. Everything was  cooked well and the sauces are great. I had shrimp and scallops and I'm really particular about people over cooking seafood but it was right where it should be- perfectly cooked scallops are hard to find!. He would tell us random drunk stories and how he got his job- apparently the owner is his brother in law. He doesnt seem to have a tight routine show as some of the other teppan-tainers but kinda fun winging it feel. It has some appeal that hes personal with us, like he's a buddy telling us his misadventures while they're hosting dinner.   2nd time was we had a visitor so the whole family- my bf, his mom and grandma and his uncle from Amsterdam came here so our visitor can experience something different. This time we had Tiger, the owner. I got shrimp and steak this time and it was pretty good again.  His routine is the best, but its a show routine hes had time to put down. He also had a few extra sauces that the first time we did not get and fried potatoes. My BF does not like fat usually (but I do!) - here they get the fat if you order a NY steak and cut it up and reduce it down and put sauce on it....he loved it! Not too fatty/greasy at all, but more of a tasty concentrated morsel of beefy flavor in teriyaki sauce.  Our guest was happy and mom and grandma liked it. They are light eaters and they allowed them to split an entree which was perfect for them so just a tip for light eaters to maybe see if you can share. Even for me, a big eater, one meal combo gets me hella stuffed!   THEORY ABOUT LUNCH:  Seems like a lot of the bad reviews are from the lunch time. From what I know about teppans lunches are usually the times when the novice teppan cooks are up to practice on smaller crowds. Could explain the difference in pricing from lunch to dinner here and a lot of comments that it wasn't so entertaining and more just cooking . Some of the same ingredients, but maybe dinner are the skilled chefs who know how to entertain and cook (the owner after all usually mans one of the teppans at dinner).For a entertaining experience and quality control warrants a higher price- to me its fair. Havent confirmed this, but just a theory about trainees and maybe I'll ask next time I'm there as well as try to catch a lunch teppan to really rate this place as a whole. I'm sure though dinner isn't always perfect either. I've been cooking for a long time and like to talk, but when guests and distractions are about even I can f*** up some of my star dishes.   So far my experiences have been good here and I have been to a lot of teppan spots.  Dinner prices are fair- even Benihana charges comparable rates for combos meats at dinner time so its not pricier than another teppan, but I feel I get better quality here and Tiger is awesome. I like that you can go all out and have a wide range of teppan meats here unlike others, but I probably would not go and spend the hundred for the kobe. I enjoy the seafood platters though so I'll probably splurge on a lobster tail eventually.   Fun for big parties, 2nd time we shared with another small party, but they were cool peeps so no complaints about that, but just more fun when it's only among friends.  Coming back to try a lunch teppan and would love to do the late night small plates in the dining side.",

    "text": "OMG.  D-LISH!  We stopped here last weekend for a quick dinner as a somewhat last resort when nearby Firefly's was completely overcrowded.  I'm so glad we did!  I have to admit that I was a little wary at first -- the place is in a strip mall and didn't smell so amazing when we first walked in.  (It was totally odd -- couldn't put my finger on it.)  But all worry subsided quickly when we were seated and our server came around!  I'm a pescetarian so I just did sushi, which was probably some of the best I've had, like, ever.  I also got some very reasonably priced sake and Asahi, which complemented the meal nicely.  My husband, bro-in-law, and his wife all got teppan yaki and our chef was hilarious (and R-rated, which made for a fun evening!).  They all raved about their respective meats/fish and I sampled my husband's fried rice, which was probably the best I've ever tasted.  This place is definitely worth the stop if you're in Vegas and looking for somewhere off the Strip with actually GOOD food.  We'll be back next time we're in the Silver State.",

We had a 7:30pm arrived early at 7pm had to wait for the next group to arrive before they started, about 40 min later we started our experience which i was excited about. Since the food channel stated the sauce is what makes them so special. WHAT SAUCE? The only sauce i got was after i finish all my meat and shrimp which was a teriyaki sauce, the cook say put the sauce on the rice. I was thining WTF, i have no more food and rice. Anyway just a bad experience overall, chef was busy talking to a regualr with kids taking up most of his attention and we felt ignored. He was a nice Korean guy, friendly however we felt disconnected from the overall experience. Better to just go with with Benihanna if we are going to do that. No go for me in the future, food was average and service was average. I still gave a 20% tip since it was labor intensive.  P.S also when i went to restroom passing by the other grilling table that crowd was having a blast and they had so many different sauces on their table, The chef is from Hawaii and was doing a great job for the other table. Anyway its just a bummer when you expect more than what you actually get.  Oh and the chef was still talking to the regular person with the group outside the parking lot, when we left. It must have been long awaited.",

I don't remember the name but the sushi is shaped as a fish. :) I thought that was interesting.  - tuna poke salad! wasn't the best I've ever had.  but still yummy!       -I had a rainbow roll -husband had an eel roll & a chicken terriyaki bowl    and at the end of all that.  plates were empty and we were super satisfied.   excellente.",

Only inconvenience is on holidays, they are super busy and the place will stay booked all night- I think that's the only time we've tasted their food to just be Ok rather than great.   Also since there's a lot of people sitting with one cook we sometimes feel that our food is shared with everybody and we don't get all of it. We've paid attention to see who gets what just to confirm our thoughts and yes, we were right they will share your food with the whole table which sucks because we wish we'd get everything we paid for. Our favorite pick is the Musashi Special which is about $60 per person. Their fried rice is to die for and specially with all their custom sauces. We've also tried their sushi side and were expecting the best just like their Teppan  side but it was just sushi, nothing really special about their rolls, didn't really care for them.   This is must try if you're into Teppan.",

Yet even low expectations would have been sorely disappointed.   We were seated with a later party (around the Teppan chef's area) so as to make our visit \"more leisurely.\" They then preceded to seat (and serve) party after party ahead of us. The three of us waited about an hour before paying our drinks bill and leaving, after repeatedly being told that our chef (and food) were \"almost there.\"  Unfortunately, everyone else at our station (maybe an additional half dozen people) was also kept waiting, and I suspect they left soon after. Which is a shame, because the food smelled good. Sadly, they just never served us any.  I recommend Ruth's Chris instead - it's just a few doors down, and they actually seem to serve all of their customers food.",

There's a private lounge you can relax in while waiting for your table (or, other guests to arrive), and the food and entertainment was really upscale without having a check to match.  I liked the chefs - albeit, one was a bit randy (probably used to that being the norm for some guests) - and the meals were really quite tasty!  It's in a very unassuming mall, so look quick!  Right now, it's next to a Mongolian place we haven't tried, so that's your marker to look for.  Strongly recommend you try this!  They can accomodate up to 18 in one sitting (I know, because we were 16 of them!).  And they can take 2 if there's room at someone else's table.  Really nice.",

If you are truly hungry & need something to tie you over before the meal, Shaggy dog Roll is a great way to start.

    "text": "this is a lengthy review for 2 reasons: 1. this was my first time here. 2. NO ONE HAS REVIEWED THIS PLACE ON YELP YET!!  i LOVED my experience here. my boyfriend and i JUST got back from our 4 day trip to vegas, and the first thing i wanted to do was share w/ all the yelpers how AMAZING this place is.    it's off the strip, in the same plaza as Firefly, so i'm sure many of you are familiar w/ the location.  SERVICE:i made a reservation for 15 people at 10pm on a saturday night, this past new years weekend.  it was not crowded at all.  we were seated right away. the prices on the menu looked a bit steep depending on what you order (about $20-60 for teppanyaki), but let me tell you, these people really know thier shit when it comes to seasoning, adding flavor, and cooking meat.  we really had a very memorable dinner here, thanks to TIGER and YOUNG (and no they are not strippers. they were our teppanyaki chefs).  TIger was obviously the veteran of the two, making vulgar jokes, and toying with us diners.  I'm guessing Young was new, but oh so very cute.  If you do end up eating teppanyaki, ask the chefs if you can wear their hat, (they'll say no, but believe me. they'll make you wear their \"special\" apron instead. trust. i fell for it).  overall, the staff was very attentive and friendly to us.    DRINKS: i had the lychee saketini and the lotus blossom. both very good, light, delivered fast, and also left me a little tipsy but not too drunk or belligerent to get bloated from dinner.    FOOD: keep in mind all teppanyaki dinners include salad, soup, rice, veggies, and a shrimp appetizer.  i ordered the Seabass (about $23) and my boyfriend had the geisha special (steak and chicken, about $25).  our proteins were cooked and seasoned perfectly, and they also made the most delicious sauces to go w/ everything, including this delightful garlic thing that i drenched my fried rice in, even though the rice already didn't need much.    we also ordered 2 sushi rolls. we had 'da bomb' (jalapeno, cream cheese and spicy tuna) which was really good if you like SPICINESS and the 'j in your mouth' roll (pretty much a tempura battered philly roll) which was also VERY VERY DELICIOUS.    AMBIANCE: i liked it. simple, not overpretentious. you could come in jeans or decked out in your sequined hootchiemama dresses.    KEEP IN MIND:  all that matters is that you don't need  to be a high roller here to get excellent service. they made my entire group feel like big ballers for one night.  we were also celebrating 2 birthdays, and my friends each got their own tempura ice cream.  the one thing i will do though, is make reservations for a later time. check the hours on the website.  i do know that they have a daily happy hour from 11pm-4am in which the prices for a lot of the menu items drops down very generously.  seriously, take advantage of this place. it really will bring you good times w/ good people.  and remember, always chat it up w/ your chefs.  they will defintely make sure that your money does not go to waste.",

Today, my birthday I call to adjust my reservations, only to be told that someone had called and canceled my reservations.  I know no one in my party has canceled, so I am mad.  The young lady insisted that my reservation has been canceled and she can't help me.  I scrambled to find another restaurant on such late notice.   After about 30 minutes,  Musashi calls me back to tell me they had made a mistake.   What kind of business does not take the time to double check reservations.  When I asked to speak to the owner, he couldn't come to the phone.   Another bad practice.  When you have wronged a customer, as the owner or management, you should get on the phone and fix it.  Offer incentives to show you are truly sorry.  Very bad buss practices..... I don't have to spend money where I am not valued.",

We would rather have a table than the bar because there's 6 of us and we wanna be able to all sit and talk with each other. They tell us it will be about a 45 minute wait. There's only a half wall separating us from more tables that are empty. They tell us we can't sit there and we ask why. They tell us there's no server on that side. It's literally 2 steps away from the rest of the tables. We ask again if we can sit at those tables and he asks the server and the server says no. We end up walking out. What's the big deal? You can't take 2 extra steps to wait on us? I guess they don't want the money. Oh well. We'll take our business elsewhere!",

    "text": "We were visiting Vegas and found this place on Yelp as a place to go for a friends birthday dinner. The food overall was very good.   We did the teppanyaki and we had a reservation for 6 people at 6pm.  Setting the reservation itself was very easy I called around 10 am and they answered right away. However, when I called back a couple times there was no answer and around 4:30 I got a text (they ask for your phone number when you make the reservation) asking if we could come at 5:30. I told them that was not possible as we had made the reservation for 6 and weren't back at our hotel yet and they said they would just try and make it work...  We arrived a little before 6 to make sure we were on time since we were going to be there at 5:30, but unfortunately since we we're sat with other people who didn't show up until 6:15 we had to wait for them.  I know that is not the restaurants fault but some information and even drinks before the other people arrived would have been great. We were sat at the table for 15 minutes without having someone come by.  The girls that were late finally got there and we were able to order.   The chef came over around 6:45/7 since he was working on the table next to us when we first got there. Like I said the food was very good and the scallops and shrimp that I got were very well flavored.  The only issue I had was with the chefs jokes.  I get that out table was all older but the raunchy jokes and even the things that he did with the food to make it sexual was a little too much.  Our whole group was feeling like it was being taken too far.    Overall, I may go back if I am in Vegas since it is always fun for a big group and the food was good, but I would make sure we had a bigger group so we wouldn't have to wait on people who were late and I would maybe ask for a different chef.",

    "text": "First things first, MAKE A RESERVATION.  They can get very busy, especially if you want teppanyaki.  This is hands down, thee best place for Japanese food!    The food is to die for, waaaayyyyyyy better than any other Japanese steakhouse you'll ever go to.   I always get the steak and lobster.  The meal comes with steak (cooked however you like), lobster, shrimp, vegetables, and (fried) rice.  TIP: TRY NOT TO EAT ALL THE FRIED RICE BEFORE THE WHOLE MEAL IS SERVED...it's hard not to eat all the fried rice, but it's just so darn good!  The steak is SO flavorful, it's cooked on a bed of garlic and is so soft and tender and juicy.  The shrimp goes well with the sweet mayo sauce, one of my faves.  And the lobster is so awesome as well, it comes with butter and garlic and lemon.  They have a good choice of domestic and Japanese beer, as well as sake, and also some mixed drinks.  I love their azuki bean ice cream as well!  It's always fun to watch the chefs cook and they do amazing tricks, as well as make your food taste sooooooooooo good!  Our favorite chef is Tiger!  He's very funny, friendly, and cooks the food the best!  WARNING: Some people may find his humor a little offensive, but my family and I think it's hilarious!  So if you have a \"prude\" you're bringing to the restaurant, this is just a heads up!  Every time I go to Las Vegas, I HAVE to come here.  I tell everyone I know about this restaurant!  And that's why I'm writing this review!  I will continue to come back and enjoy my food with great people and great memories!",

Sadly, the chef was highly offended because I took my phone out. At that point he stopped making the entertaining efforts and just cooked. This didn't take away from us paying a full priced meal. They still charged us over $100 for our \"experience\".  I will give a star for the efforts he started with, two for the waiter, and three for the sauces, steak and seafood.  The steak and seafood seemed of good quality and cooked adequately. Though they weren't necessarily flavorful or nicely seasoned; but therefore the sauces.  I am a huge rice lover... I found the rice completely tasteless and if I may, burnt and non appealing.  For all the hype I have heard about this place, I expected a bit more.  It felt dated, almost a bit dirty (Im no health inspector but check out the hoods), and not welcoming.  Needless to say, it may be disrespectful to many to use the phone at the table- which I totally understand and can relate. However, In this case, I feel it was inappropriate for the chef to take this incident personally. He had no idea how important or how Meaningful it was for me- not only to respond to the incoming texts or the fact that I wanted to treat my children to a great dining experience While in Vegas.   Good luck to them- we will not be returning.",

They make just about all of the sauces right there on the table in front of you. It's incredible!    I've ordered the fried rice to-go numerous times since I've eaten here less than a month ago.  By far the best place in Las Vegas.",

Ask for the Adult show and if there are no kids nearby you might be able to get it!  I order the Shogan special(Filet and chicken) and my wife order the NY Steak and chicken. Everything was cook perfectly to how we ordered it. I have to comment that the flavors and spin on the traditional courses of a Japanese steak house from the salad to the soup were quite unique.   The reason I gave this place four stars. The soup is extremely spicy with loads of pepper. Not sure how you mess up meso soup. Extremely pricey. There are a lot of choices in Vegas, money can make or break you.  Overall, great to experience what many famous people have in the past.",

The guy at the door is the nicest person ever and always greets you when you come in. It is never too long to be seated and the great customer service is always continued throughout the meal, the servers are the best ever also! It's always the same few people working and I understand why because they all help make the restaurant great! All the chefs are good, I do have my favorite since I like to eat there often but they all will cook your food to perfection, just how you like it. I love the teppan yaki side and the filet mignon is my favorite. The fried rice, vegetables and shrimp are always soooooo good to with the filet. Then again the salmon, prawns, lobster, and chicken is good to. Everything is good, just depends on what you want! Even the sushi there is always so fresh! The cooks are very entertaining, funny, nice and just cool as the other side of a pillow. I love this place, and everything about it! I recommend it to everyone and I know it's the best place to eat in Vegas! I even take people there to eat if they said they've never been and the always LOVE it! Years of experience and they still seem to amaze me, by making me laugh, cooking my food to perfection, the great customer service, I'm just always happy whenever I'm there! Love this place",

I made a reservation, left my name and number, and we showed up promptly.  After checking in, we noticed the host had already crossed our name off. Either someone already checked in or they marked us off, even though we showed up on time. He did try and hide the fact that he screwed up, by highlighting through my name again. He told me the wait would be about 20 minutes. After we showed up on time for our reservations. He didn't admit a mistake or anything, just told us to have a drink at their bar. We sit down at the bar, no one is behind the bar, so we aren't offered water or an alcohol menu or anything. At least give us a cup of water if you messed up.  About 10 minutes later, a loud Asian lady starting screaming at us to follow her and guides us to a table. She then starts yelling at everyone being seated that we need to sit shoulder to shoulder to each other since they are fitting two more people than the table normally holds. This indicated to me that they did give our reservation away to someone else and trying to shoehorn everyone into a cramped space was the last straw.  Me and my friend got up and told her that she could stop screaming at us, because there would be plenty of space with us gone. We ended up going to Ohjah, which had excellent service, great food, without having to deal with a host screw up and an old Asian lady screaming at us.",

    "text": "It was our first stop after flying in and dropping off our bags on a Thursday night, just after midnight. To my surprise it was pretty dead : ( We waited in the somber environment for our seats to be prepared and quickly noticed the celebrity photos with the main chef, Tiger, lining the walls near the bar. It became tangible how strikingly different the atmosphere conveyed in the photos was to what we were presently experiencing. But this would soon change.   Once seated, others shuffled in and joined our table and our orders were hastily yet politely taken by a waitress of \"a certain age\". Very anomolous data so far. I ordered a tall beer that was like $2 (great value) and the New York Steak dish. My expectations were unclear at this point - or at the very least, not high.  Our chef emerged, he seemed to have the typical \"teppanyaki chef charm\", which was a nice checkbox to tick off. As he cooked and plated our food (and our drinks went down), I was completely thrown off. Nothing seemed extraordinary about his technique or the ingredients but the fried rice was simply amazing! He even included a bonus shrimp to each person that wanted one. My friends ordered the Filet Mignon plate, which was tender but lacked deep flavor. Finally, my New York steak was prepared and it was super tender, juicy and full of flavor. It could have been the beer (on-an-empty-stomach) talking, but my New York steak with the shrimp and the exquisite fried rice were the best I've had in awhile and easily surpassed my expectations for this place. Somewhere between getting our drinks and turning on the teppanyaki burners, the atmosphere at our table went 0 to 100 and we all found ourselves really happy. Everybody was smiling, talking, drinking and eating really good food. My only gripe could be found with the size of the steak, but then I did only pay half th eprice for a full-blown fun teppanyaki experience.",

Now, I'm not sure how or why it happened by our friends told the Chef we were new to the restaurant and to give us the \"special show\"... omigod it was almost X-Rated! The Chef had a cake tin in the shape of male genitalia and put the friend rice in it on the stove top, used spicy mayo to make things \"a little more realistic\" if you get what I mean... there was a bunch of other stuff that happened during the show that I won't write as it could be a little too naughty for Yelp. If you have a sense of humour and don't mind things a little dirty I would highly suggest getting here later at night and requesting this show!  Aside from the theatrics, the food is really tasty! I got the Steak and Chicken combo and absolutely loved my food. I also had 3 bottles of the Lychee Sake- it was delicious! Definitely a hidden Vegas gym.",

And hibachi food is far too subpar to eat without an accompanying show. We should have just gone to Benihana's.

Here are some highlights: - Make a reservation for a large group. They have 4 Hibachi stations with seating for 8 each. It can get busy during peak times. - Located in a strip mall a few minutes off the strip  - Reasonable prices and large quantities of food. Guaranteed to be full.  - Soup, Salad, White/Fried Rice, Veggies, Shrimp, Meat of Choice for every meal. - \"Up the butter\" - Everything has butter from the meat to the fried rice. - Celebrity sighting spot. Last time I ate at a nearby table to TI and his group of body guards. - Special discounted LATE NIGHT menu from 12-4am!  Definitely go to Musashi if you are looking for a fun Hibachi experience while in Vegas!",

    "text": "This review is for the dining room section of Musashi, not the Hibachi grill. In the Hibachi area, there was a lively session going on and it sounded like people were enjoying themselves. In the dining area, I was all by myself in the sort of diner-style seating area. The place is a little shabby and lacking atmosphere, but you can tell they do try. It wasn't terrible.  I came to Musashi for one reason: Okonomiyaki. I was recently in Tokyo and had this dish and loved it. So I've been searching everywhere for a good Okonomiyaki, and have even learned to make it at home. Very few Japanese restaurants have it in the US, but it is everywhere in Tokyo. More below.  All-in-all this was a mediocre experience. On the plus side, I had a decent glass of Sake, and 3 courses (tuna sashimi, okonomiyaki, and ribeye steak + salad and soup) for $60. Also on the plus side: there are a ton of options on the menu and I'm sure you'll find some good dishes there. Service was also good.  The downside: my food wasn't that great. Not terrible though. - First the salad and soup- instead of the standard miso soup they give you a beef broth soup. It's a nice variation, but maybe I would have preferred a good miso. But it was ok. The salad: typical American-Japanese restaurant lettuce salad with watery, sweet ginger dressing. There was too much dressing and it was too sweet. But I brushed it off and the salad was ok. I would have preferred something a bit more authentic like a wakame salad (which was on the menu but not included with the steak).  Then the sashimi. Not bad, not fishy. Also not too flavorful. The ginger was brown. The ball of horse-radish wasabi was sad. Presentation was decent. Just OK.  Then the beef: I ordered medium-rare. But it is a very thin cut of reibeye (1/3 inch maybe) where medium-rare doesn't really exist. It wasn't too expensive, but I would've been glad to pay more money for a more substantial cut of beef. (They did have Kobe on the menu but I wasn't ready to trust them with that much money without knowing their food quality). Anyway, the steak was OK.  Then the okonomiyaki (it came last because it takes longer to cook). I was disappointed. There are 2 main styles in Japan: Hiroshima style and Osaka style. The menu made this sound like Hiroshima style (it described layers of batter, noodles and other stuff). It was Osaka style, and if there were any noodles in there I didn't see them. Usually okonomiyaki also has cabbage cooked into it but again, if it was there I didn't see it. I ordered it with pork, and I think I saw a bit of bacon (bacon or pork belly are usually used) but I found only a tiny amount. Lacking the noodles and cabbage, it was just a very thick, dense, unappetizing \"pancake\" with the normal okonomiyaki toppings. I couldn't eat more than a few bites. This is subjective, of course, and you may love it. But it wasn't near the wow experience I had in Shinjuku. I much preferred my home-made Hiroshima style in fact.   I think I would have preferred to stay in my Strip hotel and have a higher-end Japanese meal. I would have paid more money too, but hey its going on an expense report.   All that said, the menu is vary varied. I'm sure there are some standout items on there and I just didn't pick them. Also the Hibachi area was lively. So it's worth giving it a shot. I recommend that the restaurant look up Hiroshima-style okonomiyaki and learn to make it (not hard) and offer that. I think it is a unique dish but more in tune to western palettes than the thick dense style they prepared.",

    "text": "Come later in the night for some raunchy after-dark fun!! Our table got lucky being without any under aged customers so we got the 'Only in Vegas' version of the cooking show. The restaurant itself is not very big but it has a homey feeling to it. Not too far from the main strip. The prices range from affordable to high end for entrees including lobster and crab. The portions are big as with any Teppanyaki/Hibachi restaurant. They offer several different meat options, veggies are standard and you can have your meal with white rice or fried rice. This restaurant does not do noodles with your meal which is a little different but they replace that option with bean sprouts. Much healthier. The soup and salad here were very tasty. The broth is not your typical plain wonton or miso soup broth, it actually tasted like beef bone broth. I loved it but it was a little on the salty side. The salads were fresh and the dressing was not over-powering. I ordered a filet mignon entree. Then the show began....  There was a birthday at our table and before the cooking began, the chef brought out a very large black dildo...yes I said black dildo....he went behind the birthday girl and surprised her with it. Told her to close her eyes and then smacked her right in the face with it. Like I said...only in Vegas....then he suction cupped it to the table and went on cooking. With the fried rice, he used a penis shaped mold. How's that for not your typical fried rice.....plus some yum yum sauce squirting out of it....Soon enough I forgot this was a restaurant and I was waiting to eat. It turned into food porn for adults. The food itself was delicious. The shrimp was tender. A large portion of veggies, loaded with butter and soy sauce. My steak was done just the right about of medium rare. Our chef was very entertaining. One unique thing about Musashi is all the sauces they provide you. Besides the typical ginger and white sauce, they give you garlic butter sauce which is made fresh and it is so so so good! You definitely don't want to go on a date or kiss someone after cause it is extremely potent but so worth it. Definitely the most lively hibachi meal I've ever had.",

    "text": "Musashi was the first place I went to after landing in Vegas, and a great way to start off an epic trip. After much deliberation, we came here around 10pm for a late dinner. The place was empty, but they assured us they were still open. More people started coming in after us, so I guess we just bring the party with us.  Their selection is outstanding, with many items you rarely find at your standard Japanese restaurant. Lots of X-rated rolls such as Sex on the Beach, WTF, and J in My Mouth. It can take a while to decide, so if you're with a group, just get a bunch of items and do it family style.   If you're never had Okonomiyaki, this would be an optimal place to try it. I was a Japanese pizza virgin before this, and I am very glad to have popped my cherry. Okonomiyaki is a savory pancake served with noodles, veggies, sweet sauce, seaweed, various spices and your choice of meat. It's an intense myriad of flavors that balance each other out. A mildly sweet and savory combo on a heavy, but fluffy and delicious batter. It's plenty for one person and goes great with a bottle of beer.  Speaking of beer, Sapporo is $8. That's as much as my meal. Big letdown.  Service was slow, despite us initially being the only ones in the restaurant. We were told okonomiyaki would take 15-20 min, but it took at least 35. We weren't in a hurry but no one enjoys waiting.   Overall, its a great place if you're craving Japanese, but something out of the ordinary sushi/bento box deal.",

    "text": "So I may not be the target audience here. I'll be honest, I don't love teppanyaki. I feel they charge an stupid amount of money for lower quality food. You're paying for the show. I'm sorry, but if you've seen one onion volcano, you've seen them all.   A group of 5 of us came after work one night at the request of one of the people in the group. We were seated about a half hour after waiting for a table. After looking over the menu I decided to with with the Samurai Special, filet mignon and shrimp, our waiter informed me that it wold be an extra $3.50 for fried rice, which I thought was bizarre, that usually comes with dinner automatically.  We were started out with miso soup. I immediately noticed there was a ton of oil in it. I could see it floating on the top, as well as some mystery meat. The salad was ok, iceberg lettuce only, but I did like the ginger dressing.   Onto our meal. Started out with grilled vegetables, he put a large chunk of butter down into them. Same with the shrimp. Same with the meat. I was in disbelief in regards to the amount of butter that was used. Garlic. He loved garlic as well. He thought it was so special to make garlic butter. It was overkill.  So our food comes, I can guarantee you that what I was served was not filet mignon. During dinner, one of the people in our group had requested more yum yum sauce. The \"chef\" reaches for the bottle of yum yum sauce and holds it in front of his junk as in gesturing something. He thought this was hilarious, the rest of us thought it was gross and innapropriate. I get that they have an adult dinner later, but we weren't apart of that. It was gross.  Anywho, $60 for dinner and a single glass of wine. Totally not worth it.",

My last visit to Musashi was last week and my friend made a reservation and requested Tiger. They had recently remodeled & the dining room looks great! At dinner, we sat with a group of first-timers who asked my friend for recommendations since the whole staff kept saying hi to her!   For dinner, I ordered the New York steak & shrimp with fried rice. It comes with salad & soup, of course. The chefs make their own sauces & they are very accommodating if you want it spicier, sweeter, or whatever. The dinner show as hilarious; Tiger was pretty good about picking on everyone! I also think it's quite awesome that our chef is the owner. He definitely set the bar for his chefs to be as fun & entertaining.  I do not remember them putting as much garlic with their steak as they did this last time. I was not a fan, but I just enjoyed the rest of my meal. After dinner, my friend & I were treated to tempura ice cream! I have always had great experiences here & I recommend Musashi to everyone!",

The worst part is the table that they gave us was trying to squeeze us all behind the back of the chef. I was so mad of how bad attitude they gave us and I don't think we would wanna eat facing the butt of the chef. We just stood up and left immediately. Place is so dirty and is run by all Chinese!",

    "text": "One of the better if not best Japanese Teppanyaki places I've been too anywhere (Including Japan itself) For those of you unfamiliar of what Teppanyaki is, it's the melding of technique and style with Japanese cuisine pan fried on a Teppan (huge) grill. The chef always puts on an elaborate show with acrobatic shrimp and flying vegetables to entertain and wow the guests.  You will always leave this place  fully stuffed and drunk (well at least me lol)!  If you come to Teppanyaki restaurants often, you will often get tired of the same routine they pull, so it's best to go once in a while or bring friends who never experienced it themselves. But the food is always delicious so I don't mind some of the acts getting old really.  My favorite is the Musashi Special, it comes with Filet mignon, prawns, scallops, lobster tail, fried rice and choice of ice cream all for $58. It's a lot of food so be prepared. Here is the list of the main Teppanyaki entrees.  Musashi Special 58.00 Filet mignon, prawns, scallops, lobster tail, fried rice and choice of ice cream  Steak Lovers Special 90.00 Kobe beef, New York steak and filet mignon  Kimono Special 22.50 Sukiyaki steak and chicken breast  Geisha Special 26.75 New York Steak and chicken breast  Katana Special 24.00 Chicken breast and prawns  Ronin Special 32.00 Prawns and scallops  Ninja Special 29.00 Salmon filet and prawns  They also have sushi and sushi rolls. I've tried a lot of them and all of them are very good comparable to actual specialized sushi restaurants. This place is also open late (4.a.m.) If you never tried Japanese Teppanyaki, this is a good first place to try!",

While searching through yelp for potential restaurants for dinner, we came across this one and decided to go.   Boy are we happy we did!  We were immediately seated at one of the tables.  We were there about 8 pm which is early as the place is famous for their late night happy hour. We ordered the steak and prawns.  The food was delicious!  The steaks were cooked perfectly and so flavorful; the fried rice is to die for with a garlic/butter sauce!!  The best part is watching The Tiger (the owner) at work cooking and joking around with all of us.   Watching the Tiger create all of his delicious sauces is part of all the fun. We are definitely asking for him next time!",

However, the third time I went there for another bachelor/bachelorette   party. Food was still great but they didn't cook the fat which I missed. I asked for the dirty show and we did not get it. I didn't want to complain but it really pissed me off. I will still go back but I expect the show next time. If they don't do it anymore they should have told me. The food is still worth going for.

My husband said I didn't realize how much Ice Tea I had, lol. I took my 5 year old with us, and Tiger was so friendly with her and was asking her questions,  he also noticed that I was pregnant and got special treatment.  I loved it. The food was amazing.  The steak melted in your mouth. The rice is to die for and don't get me started on the sauces. Thank you Tiger for an amazing night.   we will be going back again,  hopefully soon. I also think that the prices are very reasonable for the type, quality,  and amount of food you get. We spent close to $275.00 on the 3 of us :)",

    "text": "We were looking to dine near the Hard Rock and my friend suggested Musashi. She had been here before and raved about how great the teppanyaki was.  When we walked in there was no hostess, we walked up to the bartender and asked if we had to seat ourselves, he ended up calling a waiter over. My friend asked if we could do the teppanyaki, we were told we could but not until 9:30 p.m. because we didn't have reservations. We didn't know it was mandatory to make one. We had a show to go to so we sat down to dine in the main dining area instead. I ended up ordering the following items:   Pork Gyoza- $4.50 Shrimp Dragoons- $6.00 NY Steak (Hot Iron)- $18.00  The NY steak entree included miso soup, salad, fried vegetables (they no longer offer mashed potatoes), and steamed white rice. When ordering the steak it could either be served teriyaki style or just plain salt and pepper with a side of oroshi ponzu sauce. I opted to go with the salt and pepper. I ordered my steak well done and it was still very juicy and tender, I didn't end up touching the vegetables because they consisted of onions, zucchini (my arch nemesis), and carrots.The miso soup came with mushrooms, scallions, and little pieces of meat, it had a little kick, it was very flavorful. The salad was just iceberg lettuce topped with ginger dressing which was really good, it was sweet but not overpowering. The shrimp dragoons were a-okay, they're just like crab rangoons except they have shrimp instead of crab. I'll most likely skip ordering them next time. I ordered the pork gyoza steamed, but you can also order it fried, it was good, the pork had a nice salty taste. I really wanted to try the cream balls but they are no longer part of the menu. Our waiter said they were changing a lot of the things on the menu because I noticed some parts of the menu were blacked out.   Our waiter was very attentive throughout the whole meal, we never even had to ask him for any refills because as soon as we were done with 3/4 of our drink, he'd bring more out. I was really happy with our service and meal. I will be back because I really want to try the teppanyaki but I'll make sure to set a reservation next time.",

Don't get me wrong, all of the guys are great, but he makes delicious sauces and his personality is fun. Not only do they serve teppanyaki here, they also have sushi and a kitchen menu.   Pros: -Half price after 12am (last call is 3:30am) -Make their own sauces (sweet mayo is the best) -Friendly staff  Tips: -Make a reservation if you're going on a weekend or around 7pm...they get really busy! You can even request which chef you would like.  -Try the sweet mayo! It's the sauce they put on the shrimp, but I put it on everything. It's amazing!  -Even if you only kind of like fried rice, get it!!! This is the most delicious fried rice ever. Plus if you put sweet mayo on it, you'll be hooked.  -The dinner show can get dirty (jokes) so be prepared!  Don't forget to end your meal with mochi ice cream! :)",

When I've gone with only adults the chef are hilarious, and you have to get the dirty show. Make sure if you go to celebrate anyone ask for the beer bong. You won't be disappointed.

    "text": "Favorite place to go for late night teppanyaki or sushi. Their happy hour is the best, usually sushi starts at 11-close and teppanyaki starts at 12. We always call ahead and make reservations, so we do not have to wait. Our favorite cook is of course Tiger (the owner) or Octavio. Both cooks are amazing and can definitely add some really good flavor to all of the food.   For sushi, they honestly have the best spicy salmon and spicy tuna.  Teppanyaki, I always get their shrimp with extra fried rice and a side of mushrooms. Extra garlic and really spicy sauce on the side. Yummm  Hands down one of my favorite restaurants here in Vegas, as you can tell I have checked in here 29 times, going on 30 :)",

If you look carefully, all the good reviews are from the teppanyaki meals. Call ahead and make a reservation as those tables go fast.   If you're unlucky as us and end up at the regular table, you won't be able to order anything from the teppanyaki menu. You have your own menu of sushi. Man.... that sushi, if you can even call it that, was horrible. I think Ralph's near me has better sushi than this place. I also ordered a chirashi bowl and it was just sad to even look at it. Most of it was salmon (3 pieces).... super thin slices. Their red snapper looking fish (which they said was yellow tail) was really chewy.I think the best thing in that bowl was the imitation crab.   If you make reservations and get the teppanyaki table, then you're golden. However, do yourself a favor and  eat elsewhere if you cannot. This is Vegas, there are plenty of amazing choices here and there is no reason you should suffer like we did.",

    "text": "I'm amazed that it took me 16 years in Vegas to find this place.  I love Teppanyaki. I used to frequent Hamada when it was on Flamingo (back when it was good), and have eaten at many teppanyaki places, Osaka, Geisha Steakhouse, Ohjah, etc, etc. This by far was my favorite experience.  They have quite an extensive menu, featuring anything from Kobe Beef to NY Strip Steak, Lobster, Scallops, Prawns, Chicken, Salmon and more. Probably more selection than other places. Prices are a little bit higher, but the quality makes it worthwhile. I opted for the Samurai 3 dinner, NY Strip and Salmon, for $33 (add $3.50 for fried rice). So not too bad.  Chef Yung (probably misspelled) was excellent. He does all the tricks with the knife and spatula, onion volcano, etc. He really stood out because he can cook!!! He took some special sauce orders and whipped them up. My salmon could have been prepared 3 different ways, I chose lemon dill and it was great! The conversation at the table also focused on Yelper's favorite subject.....other restaurants!! Tiger the owner has a couple new ones coming up. He also gave us a few to try out which of course I can't remember (thanks Sake and Sapporo).   Overall, just a very pleasant dining experience, with good high quality food. I'll be back, and I'll be sure to highly recommend to anyone seeking good Teppanyaki.",

Then, when I explained that I doubted her entire party of 40 would be there by 7pm, let alone have their whole drink order taken and served, she just said she couldn't seat us.  This place must be doing a killer business to turn away a super quick dinner crew and any other walk in business 45 minutes before their next reservation. Oh, and sketchy area, homeless people everywhere, and not well lit.  Never again.",

Don't be fooled by the fact Mushashi is inside a strip mall. Once you enter and see the wall of fame you will quickly realize this place is the REAL deal. I am pretty sure every celebrity has eaten here at some point.   If you're lucky Tiger will cook for you and you will get dinner and a show. All of the chefs have great personalities and you will quickly fall in love with this place for the food and atmosphere.   I typically get the Mushashi special which is enough to feed two people. I always try to finish it.   Enjoy this place and spread the word!",

But, we are both so glad we did stop by.  We came around 10:30 on a Thursday night; the front part of the restaurant was packed, but the teppanyaki part was completely  empty. We were seated right away, and was told the chef would start in a few minutes.   Another party arrived, and Chef Jason came out. Now, Jason was probably the best part of the entire experience. He was friendly and offered such great service. We had to personally tip him $30 in the end (that's how great he was!) My boyfriend is a sauce person, and Jason made so many delicious sauces that definitely added to the steak and seafood that we ordered.  Some of the reviews mentioned not eating all the fried rice at the beginning of the meal, and it's so True! The rice was so delicious that I managed to finish it all... Before he started cooking anything else. Learned my lesson, because I was so full to fully enjoy the steak, shrimp, lobster tail, and vegetables. He cooked both steaks to a perfect medium rare and the lobster tail was drenched deliciously in a creamy sauce.   We're returning in August to celebrate my 21st birthday, and I definitely will be asking for Jason again.",

For this bachelor party of 7 dudes, I would say the Chef himself was an experience. Sure, you've got your typical teppanyaki chefs who flip spatulas, toss salt shakers, and throw in the occasional cheesy joke. This Chef, however, was highly talented and extremely hilarious. Dirty jokes galore, witty comebacks to our stupid drunken comments, and foul props made this experience a True show! Not to worry, no need to get decked out and dressed up either, very down to earth, casual restaurant.  Food was phenomenal. The Chef took pride in his cooking, insisting we try certain foods without dipping in sauce first to really taste the talent. I got the filet mignon and prawns dinner. Meat was quality, seasoning was perfect with a special mayonnaise like sauce on the prawns. Fried rice was moist, and my favorite part was a special little treat the Chef concocted with the trimmed fat off steaks. I only wished the dish also had chow mein.  Chef made so many house made sauces that I couldn't even figure out what to dip my food in, they were all awesome.  For 7 people, stuffed outta our minds, beer and sake filled, and cheeks (on the face, to clarify) hurting from laughing... Our bill was $500 including gratuity.   Absolutely excellent experience. HIGHLY recommended!",

I'm a bit apprehensive about writing this review because I would much rather be selfish and keep this amazing restaurant to myself but my mother taught me that sharing is caring, so don't say I never did anything for you! ;)  Last weekend was marked my third visit to Musashi. I don't live in Vegas but whenever I visit I try to make reservations here and I do recommend making reservations because this place can be quite hard to get into otherwise since they only have so many seats at the teppan tables.   You can pretty much order anything off the menu and you will be pleased but my faves are the filet mignon and shrimp. The chefs here are AMAZING and very entertaining as well!!  Musashi is located just off the strip and took us about 8 minutes to get to from Caesar's Palace.  As we were paying our bill last time Floyd Mayweather and his HUGE entourage were being sat at the table next to us. This place has pics of celebrities all over the wall and its no surprise why. Rated as one of the best steakhouses in America and it holds up to all the hype!",

WHAT: My friend and I randomly decided to redeem ourselves and try out Musashi when they were actually open, so we headed here at 6pm! We made reservations just incase (better to be safe than sorry), and it wasn't as busy as I thought it would be. Hallelujah! The decor was quite nice and intimate, we were seated, and ordered.  The staff were all so sweet! From our server to our Chef (we had Chef Octavio) - phenomenal! =D  We were first asked the occasion of us being there, we replied \"For Fun.\" I did not think my \"for fun\" answer would lead to such surprising consequence, but it really was FUN! I don't want to ruin it for you first-timers, so just get on in there and have fun! Lol. THERE IS DEFINITELY A SURPRISE WAITING FOR YOU... MUAHAHA!  On the food-end of the spectrum, it was delicious! My friend and I decided to get the filet mignon/shrimp/lobster combo. It was accompanied with several sauces (I am a saucy type of girl. Lol), veggies to start with, and tasty fried rice to pair with the seafood and meat. While Chef Octavio was cooking our food in front of us, I was like a child embracing every cool moment1 Who would have ever known cooking could be such entertainment!!  Overall, this experience definitely goes in the books!! From the workers, people, and food... FIYAHHHHH!!!",

She even taught us a song & to sing before we took sake bombs...it was seriously the bomb! LOL  We made reservation with the owner (TIGER) can I say....his humor was hilarious! We were laughing the entire time! He even got us a round of peach sake....it was so good to the point where I had to buy us a bottle!   Over all experience was phenomenal! We would definitely go back again, when we're in town. Thanks for showing us a great time guys!!! ;)",

The last time I came here, the group I came with did the happy hour special. Definitely a must-try late night food place!  I did the seafood combo that comes with miso soup, fried rice, shrimp, scallops and fish! It also comes with many different sauces made to order from the chef all for only $20! (Happy hour special) Because I went with a big group of early to mid 20's age, the teppan yaki chef made funny after-hour remarks! The chef was so funny and very accommodating.   I went here for my mom's birthday as well a few months ago and I went with my family. The chef was so nice and funny.. he was not going to do some \"adult\" jokes. Instead, he cooked the fried rice in a heart-shaped form and was trying to make my grandma laugh! My family enjoyed it and they loved the food!  I love this off-the-strip spot! A local hot spot, a tourist favorite, and you might spot a celebrity here or there! If you're in Vegas, you should try place!",

The BEST time to come is for Happy Hour. For sushi; it starts at 11pm, for teppan it starts at 12am. Especially on the weekends it gets pretty busy, so if you are getting teppan - make sure you make reservations!   This used to be my favorite place to come to have a late night dinner, drinks, and kick it. I use to come 3-4 times a week after work. Unfortunately due to their change of staff, it's not that fun anymore. Customer service has gone down the drain. The hustle, and aiming to please is completely out the window. (The teppan cooks and sushi chefs have not changed at all. But only 1 remains from their previous serving staff!)",

There are 2 sides you may sit at teppanyaki grill or dining/sushi bar. For teppanyaki I recommend requesting for Tiger (Owner) to be your chef. He is the best along with Young. Unlike other teppanyaki restaurants they have many different homemade very yummy dipping sauces to go with meal.   Teppanyaki happy hour starts at Midnight!! Great food at a great price!! ..after 12am you could also request for the \"Dirty Adult Show\" perfect for bachelor/bachelorette parties or a good laugh.  Tiger hour is their Happy hour menu that starts at 11pm and can be order from both sides of the restaurant. Beto amd Jun are great sushi chefs!! You'll be in good hands.",

    "text": "I came out here last year for my friend's birthday, and let me tell you the cook was outstandingly hilarious.  He knew how to entertain the crowd, and not keep the noise at a silence.  Even though most of his jokes did have a dirty connotation to it, I thought he was a character.  The prices are a little high, but for a group of five we paid a little over $150.00 (not including tip).    Tepanyaki allows the chef to cook your food right in front of you, while putting a show.  (Well, I think that's what it is to my understanding)  This place gives you a vast array of dipping sauces for your food.  My personal favorite is the yum-yum sauce, and the lemon garlic butter would be the second.  I did wish they cooked the food all at once, because you wait for rice, veggies, then meats to be cooked and then you can eat.  It's like a long wait cause he puts a show with it.  The fried rice is good, I've had better but it does compliment the food you eat.  The chef even gives you choice of either adding spice, or no spice.  I ordered the Musashi special, which was like $58.00.  It came with prawns, shrimp, lobster tail, steak and one dessert.  The steak came out really tender, and the shrimp had an amazing flavor with the yum-yum sauce.  And the lobster tail tasted off the hook with the garlic butter lemon sauce.  The veggies were mediocre, but the green tea ice cream did settle everything down in my stomach.  The flavors are such a variety, you wouldn't know what hit you.    If you do come here, try to sit with Tony.  He's a character, and he keeps you entertained throughout the whole night.",

We had SUCH an amazing time at Musashi.  We were seated right away, then greeted by \"Ninja\".  He brought out our drinks, and when I asked him to return mine (the iced tea wasn't to my liking) he replaced it with something else.  We were incredibly lucky to have the owner, Tsutomo (aka \"Tiger\"), cook for us.  He was AMAZING!!!  The food was beyond incredible and watching him cook it was a joy.    Tsutomo's wife helped us get a cab after our meal, then waited outside and talked with us.    I'm not sure that much of anything can live up to the experience we had.  I will say this, if you have somewhere to be...it's best to make early reservations.  The entire experience was about 2 hours, and they hadn't picked up yet.

    "text": "Puts Benihana to shame!!!  Sorry, but you haven't had Teppan Yaki until you've been here. We came here to celebrate the New Year and also our good friend's birthday.  Well worth every penny. Reservations strongly recommended - and if you can, request a table with the owner - Tsutomu Molde.  He is AMAZING!  A lot of fun, and a great cook.  We felt that we were given VIP treatment as he doled out his special sauces.  And believe me - his recommendations do not disappoint.  Can't wait for him to start selling his sauces...so ono! We started with sushi... Oh Toro - of course...just for  me.  Well worth every bite Smoked Salmon - so good Spicy Tuna - yum yum Da Volcano Roll (crab & avocado baked w/spicy tuna on top) - oh delish Porn Star ( I forget what was in it - but the best Porn in town I promise) The miso soup had thinly sliced pieces of flank steak - never had miso soup this way before, but it was sooo good Everyone ordered from the Teppan Menu -  A few Samurai Specials: I. New York Steak and Prawns - no leftovers - nuff said II. New York Steak and Scallop - I'm not sure if the food even touched the plate A few Hosokawa Clan Specials: I. Filet and Prawns - he made bunnies out of the shrimp - too cute.  the food was amazing II. Filet and Scallops - my selection and I have NO regrets.  YUMMY!!! Masumi Special: Filet Mignon, Lobster Tail, Fried Rice, & Ice Cream - again....DELICIOUS My friend and I also enjoyed a lychee martini - very generous serving there, and they were just as generous with the alcohol as well.  No complaints! There were seriously no left overs at the end of our meals.  And there were 9 of us all together too. The only negative I would say is that the service before our meal was not too great....but once we were seated - all was forgiven.",

It's pretty much your typical teppanyaki restaurant w/ sexual jokes and lots of fire. :P It was really yummy, but I don't think it was THAT special. I suppose the prices were pretty good. I had the Musashi Special which comes w/ the filet, prawns, scallops, and lobster tail. Mmm... drooling now... Husband had the Yoshida Special which is the rib-eye and lobster tail. I wanted to try their sushi too, but that's a lot of food already. Everything was yummy, the chef was cool, and the others at the table were cool too. The fried rice and the veggies are always a good way to start the meal. Oh, and they bring you a salad before the chef starts. For dessert, I had the red bean ice cream and my husband had the green tea. I should have gone with my usual, but I wanted to try something different. Green tea ice cream was better. Good place, I'll come back someday!  Oh, don't get any cocktails. They're just okay.",

I went there on a Saturday night about 12ish and I guess it was happy hour, which was kinda nice and different from other places.  They have decent amount of choices on the happy hour menu, but there's many more on the regular menu.  The decor inside the place can definitely improve, very plain and seemed outdated.  The service was good, I'm guessing since there weren't that many people.  The shaggy dog was delish, and OMG, the OMG was super delicious.  It was definitely a great value since it was happy hour.  So I will definitely go back.",

One would expect the inside of the restaurant to be a bit more nice looking, considering the price of the meals and the fact that they serve the holy grail of steaks--Kobe beef.  In fact, it was the Kobe beef that saved it from a 2-star rating.  Although the chef's, as well as the owner's, show was more entertaining and more daring (They actually play with fire!) than those at Benihana, their cooking was just the same.  Gone are the days when the chefs (especially the Japanese ones) would serve you a sizzling meal cooked on a high-heated iron grill!",

My guest didn't trust the nigiri, which is sort of our benchmark for sushi places, but I wanted to give the chef the benefit of the doubt and I was wrong. The tempura appetizer was good in that it was prepared well and used the correct batter, but it was a touch on the small size. The rolls themselves were mostly junk, though, with yet another place trying to play hide and seek with flavor by utilizing and relying on sauces. I don't recall all the ones that we had, but none of them were anything special. Price was excessive on a couple of the ones were ordered were this in an area not Vegas, but was quite reasonable for Vegas. Ambiance and wait staff were also good. I probably would not return, as I think there's much better to be had and would much prefer to try every other sushi place without a 50% or AYCE sign in the window first.  My suspicion is you're better sticking to the actual cooked food at this place.",

    "text": "I came here for a bachelor party.  The bachelor saw this place on a food network TV show and decided he wanted to eat here.  I was a bit surprised because teppanyaki isn't a normal bachelor party type of meal, but hey, he's the bachelor.  In any case, we were served by the owner of the place (the same guy the bachelor saw on TV).  He told me his Japanese name but I forgot it just as he said I would and I remember his nickname of \"Tiger\" because he wears a tiger striped chefs hat.    I've eaten a lot of teppanyaki in my time.  They're all pretty good, but in then end, meh.  They're all the same. With that said, this place is not the same.  This place is a cut above the rest.  The ingredients here were definitely better, the number of sauces they provided were greater, and the entertainment was much, much better.  With that said, they entertained us like we were a bachelor party, which we were.  So you might not get that part if you eat here but you'll definitely get the food which is the best teppanyaki I've ever had.  Order the Miyazaki beef.  It's like butter.  Look it up.  It's better than the overhyped Kobe beef that's on every other menu in the States. Though in actuality, I've learned that in most of the cases, what you're getting is not True Kobe beef.  So maybe they are comparable. They're both from the same Wyagu breed.",

    "text": "Musashi came highly recommended, after two visits, I can only say this place deserves NO stars.  First visit. We asked for the \"adult\" show for a visiting friend.  Got two bowls of rice turned upside down with some round veggie on top and they called it boobs... great... I paid 20% more over Benihana for rice boobs?  The food was okay, so I'll give it another shot.  Second and final visit.  - 6 weeks out:  Made reservations for adult show for 7 at 10pm.  - 3 weeks out:  Called to confirm reservation for adult show for 7 at 10pm. Confirmed.  - Reservation:  Showed up 15 minutes before and checked in with the hostess, confirmed that we had reservation for 7 and for adult show.  She tells us to tell the server you want adult show.  She then proceeds to sit a party of 3 at our table... they had a 9 year old with them.  While most 9 year old nowadays have probably seen more internet porn than most adults my age, I did the adult thing and let the hostess know that she just sat a kid at the adult show table.  Apparently, according to the hostess, a 9 year old seeing a 2 foot long big black dildo with simulated jiz is, to her, perfectly fine.  I continued to ask for an kid free adult show.  After asking for the manager, I was told that she was not at the restaurant.  After further pressing, we asked to speak with the owner Tsutomu (AKA Tiger)... we explained our situation, about making reservations and blah blah blah... he couldn't give two shits.  Taking the high road, we decided to leave and not scar the poor kid.  This is what I get from wanting to see a big black dildo at a Japanese restaurant.  It is now my mission in life to divert any and all tourist away from this shitty place.",

    "text": "A lot of different emotions and opinions on the experience here. Main thing to note is this is a good place to go if you're not expecting a fancy Teppanyaki restaurant and you realize it's a good deal for the price.   First thing is on the website it says that late night happy hour starts at 11pm, this is half True. Late night happy hour dinner area starts at 11pm, teppanyaki starts at midnight. Sushi rolls vary from $3.50-5 wide variety smaller than normal. You can order off full sushi menu at full price. Teppanyaki Filet mignon $16, seafood (calamari, crab sticks (imitation crab), scallops, shrimp $18.50. Place is packed at midnight so reservations are a good idea. Waiters aren't the friendliest, ambiance is okay, clean but no benihana. Like I said, if you're looking for a fancy Japonese restaurant... this isn't for you. Small only 2 teppan sections / 4 stove stations. Locals place, big on group events. They don't start taking your order till 12:20am, start teppan cooking till at least 12:45am so if you arrive at midnight, just plan on waiting, however if you don't come right at 12 or a little before, you may not get a seat. Sushi bar is open so share a roll and that'll tie you over. 1 hour 45 min later meal was finished. Chef was very nice and friendly, apologized for our long wait and the food was delicious. Shout out to the Island Boy Nick for being a great waiter.",

Upon a request from my colleagues, I looked up some Japanese restaurants with more than 4 yelp stars and a reasonable price range (not high end on the strip), and came across this.  Obviously, for teppan yaki, you would need a reservation. But we were there for sushi, and didn't have a problem getting a normal dining table.  The restaurant has kind of lousy interior. I am not really a fun of red painted walls especially for Japanese restaurant. We ordered variety of sushi rolls from traditional ones to American born ones. Simple traditional salmon or tuna rolls were good and fish quality was surprisingly good as well. Some other American style rolls were just ok. Nothing impressive. The service was as slow as traffic on strip.  Somehow, I had generally high expectations for Las Vegas restaurants, but I could easily find plenty of better Japanese restaurants elsewhere. So it was a little bit disappointing.",

So we asked the sushi chef if we could sit anywhere. He said yes. So we picked a table and waited a few more minutes and no one came over. Then the sushi chef asked if we could move to the sushi bar as the waitress was busy in the teppanyaki room. (The restaurant is split in half, a teppanyaki side and a sushi side.) So we moved to the sushi bar. After the initial confusion with getting service, things went find.  I ordered Lunch Box A with a spicy tuna roll and teriyaki salmon. Both were quite good. The salmon was a little hard to eat with chopsticks but was cooked well.  The meal was served with Miso soup which was a great start on a cold and rainy day. It was hot and flavorful.  The box came with edamame, a gyoza, and salad. All of which were very good.  The box was around $11 which is a little more than I like to pay for lunch, but it was worth it. I'll be back.",

He said he could only give me a 5pm or 8 pm reservation . So we went with 5 pm . After  we arrived (17) of us \"we were never greeted just stood there for about 20 minutes before being acknowledged by a server. He said he could not seat us . I said , what do you mean ? Its my birthday I don't understand ??? We had a reservation , he said I already asked the chef Yong and there was nothing they could do???? What was the purpose of a reservation . I asked if he was really turning away 17 people ?? Without a worry he said there was nothing he could do that he had to many 6 pm reservations . And with that we left confused ???? Never again will I ever return to this place in my life or would I recommend this to my worse enemy .",

It was hard to be a healthy pescetarian here. Lots of fried, lots of soaked in oil-y sauces, all of the specialty drinks have a ton of sugar.  The waiter even said that when he eats there, that he always double checks that the fish is fresh. So... sometimes it's not? Eeek.  Gosh, I sound like a brat. It was late and we were starving. It worked... but, we most likely will not be back.",

    "text": "Musashi is a Japanese Steak house, with a great location on Paradise Road, just off of the chaotic strip. Open only after 5 p.m. and it is conveniently open until 4 a.m. great for the late night cravings. They have a great and popular Teppenyaki area to the restaurant. If you do not know what Teppenyaki is, it is an area in where you sit around a grill and an entertaining chef grills your food and puts on a show for you.  Musashi also has a sushi bar as well as a dining room area. They have happy hour starting at 11p.m. making their sushi rolls very cheap at about starting at about $4 dollars. Being a usual for several years now, the wait staff as well as the sushi chef are very friendly. I have brought with me a few sushi skeptics that swore not to like sushi but were willing to try anyways and they ended up returning for more.    By far my favorite sushi place I have been to a few different ones but I always come back to Musashi in the end. My three favorite rolls are the Christian roll, Shaggy Dog, and the 911. The Christian is a shrimp tempura roll with eel sauce. I may add that I love their eel sauce I make sure my Christian roll has a lot of it. The Shaggy dog roll is also a shrimp tempura roll topped with crab meat and a delicious creamy sauce. These two rolls also happen to be on the happy hour menu so they are about $5 dollars each. The 911 roll is a spicy tuna roll with topped with salmon I also love to drench this with their delicious eel sauce. Unless you can handle spicy food I would recommend sticking to the Shaggy or the Christian. As an appetizer I enjoy having their tofu and sea weed miso soup. I love how fast my sushi always comes out. I never wait no longer than 5 minutes to get a table. The ambiance is great there are as many locals as well as tourist who enjoy going to get a late snack. I like how even though it is open very late it is a family place, meaning that you can bring your kids with you if you get hungry on your way home from a long day.    The few downfalls Musashi might have are that sometimes even though they are a clean place there is a strong sewer smell, which makes it a bit difficult to enjoy your food completely. Another downfall is that the Teppenyaki is always full so you must make reservations hours before you cannot just show up without a reservation. Sometimes even with a reservation you are kept waiting a while because something went wrong and they are running late on getting the others ahead of you out.     Musashi being my favorite Japanese steak house, I would greatly recommend people to try it. From a great location, great prices, friendly staff and fast sushi service I would think everyone would enjoy it. Whether you are by yourself, on a date, a group of friends or a family, Musashi is the best place for a late dinner or even an after work snack.",

Greeted with a smile from the young Asian man behind the counter who was quick to attend to us as well as seat our group. Of course we were told there would be a 15 minute wait because it was so busy but the young man and my father started talking about the wonderful shows in Vegas and within 5 minutes he had us seated. Our waiter David was super attentive through out the night and exceeded my expectations to showing my family a good time! I will definitely take all of my out of state friends and family to Musashi again and again! Food was absolutely perfect!  Thank you for an awesome dinner and for providing such great service!",

When we said we were 1 mile away & according to our GPS we would be there in 3 minutes, we were told they could seat us at his table. We arrived & the person who greeted us was not aware of the situation .  He went to \"check\" & left us waiting for 10 minutes, only to return & tell us it was not possible & we could wait until 8:30 to be seated at another chef's table. So we waited. At 8:30 we were seated by ourselves at a table. Then a party of 25 arrived and another employee asked us why we were at the table as both of their remaining tables were reserved for the party of 25. So after waiting for 25 minutes with 2 broken promises, we left. If I could give zero stars I would. Unbelievably poor communication, processes, management & customer service. The guy who had seated us tried to hide in the kitchen from us. I would never go back!  Congratulations-you just lost 2 customers for life!",

We made reservations for 8pm and were there 10 minutes early.  We were told that the table was not ready and we would need to wait a few minutes in the lounge.  We ordered a few drinks and continued to wait as the lounge filled up with others waiting.  We finished our drinks and were ready for more but realized it was already past 830 and we had plans later.  I approached the podium and calmly said we had 800 reservations it is now 830 and we were told it would only be a few minutes at 750.  I asked when we would be seated.  The guy at the podium was haughty and replied with \"whenever it is ready.\"  Some others that were waiting had overheard our exchange and began talking saying they had been waiting since 730.  I headed to my party of 6 and told them that we would be leaving right now.  As we pasted by the podium another party had approached the podium.  I announced to all listening that we were not waiting and leaving.  We headed across the street to Del Frisco's, one of the best steakhouses in Vegas.  They were friendly and sat us right away.  The service was a stark juxtaposition to those across the street.  Musashi's was just another example of the horrible service at a lot of the places in Vegas.",

We came in around 5ish on a weekday, and we were seated at the sushi bar immediately.  I was impressed with their menu since they carry some different rolls.  Although the prices are fairly high, I enjoyed all the sushi we ate.  There was a baked tempura lobster roll that I ate four orders of, which tipped our bill to about $80 bucks alone.  Everything was great from the negi to the special rolls.  The fish tastes fresh and they do not skimp on how much they give you.  I'm all down for this place again.  As long as I have a full wallet, I'll go all out next time at the sushi bar.  Try  it out sometime.",

Due to it having some weird looking meat in it.

The food was actually pretty good, but I give it one star less because our waiter didn't seem to know very much about the things on the menu. He had to keep leaving us to ask the chef in the back.   The different kinds of rolls were unique & creative. I tried one with a green soy wrap with salmon, hamachi, & imitation crab. It was pretty good. I wish these places used real crab in their rolls. I also tried a handroll which had uni, unagi, cream cheese, & masago inside. That was different, but I think the cream cheese takes away the taste from the uni. The beef takaki they used thick slices of beef & I thought it was a little overdone. I'm used to thin peices of raw beef.  My parents had the sukiyaki which they seemed to like.  The prices were very reasonable. I would probably come back again if it was convenient (not very cuz it's off the strip).",

The chef cooked everything with the same seasoning/sauces. I ordered the New York strip steak (6 oz) and scallops. Steak wasn't bad neither were the scallops, but I hoped for a bigger portion of scallops as they were 4 tiny pieces. Someone was lucky in our group and got 5!  I wished we were given more of the garlic sauce (my favorite out of all the others that were provided). I didn't take pictures of the food since I was hungry waiting for each item to finish cooking and served. Each item came at different times as well so I wasn't going to wait until it was all done cooking to take an overall photo either.  The chef was somewhat entertaining, a bit quiet. We saw more \"tricks\" performed by other chef around  and Tiger (the owner I believe). I would say my birthday friend gave us a great show  they have a penis beer bong! I would say you come here for the experience, the food was decent, nothing special to me and portion was a bit disappointing. I was told the fried rice was good, but that is a $3.50 upcharge. $5 sharing fee is added if you are sharing. Our waiter although nice, was not too attentive at coming back to refill our groups waters. I think our dinner was 2.5-3 hours long and I recall seeing him check on us 2-3 times. I do not think I would be back at this establishment since nothing really stood out to me.  I heard the filet mignon is good and the lobster tail I saw is also a small portion (4-5 bite sized pieces). I really enjoyed the salad, it had like a minced ginger. Stir fry vegetables were alright.",

    "text": "I was hoping this place would be better or comparable to Benihana. I was wrong!   -The chef at our table was EXTREMELY slow. He only knew how to cook 1 thing at a time. The table next to us started cooking 20 min after us, and by the time we finally got our entrees, they were already almost done eating.  -Everything was cooked in a shitload of butter. Don't get me wrong - I love butter...but you can't just throw butter in all the food and expect it to taste delicious. I felt SO greasy and oily eating the food, and it all ended up tasting the same because the seasoning for everything was literally just butter, salt, pepper.  -Our chef and our waitress did not have a friendly relationship with each other and they showed it. Super awkward to experience.   Maybe my expectations were too high. If you've never had teppanyaki before, you might be impressed by this place for what it is. If you've had it before, save yourself and just go to Benihana down the street. They're a huge chain for a reason.",

I've been looking for a place that serves grilled squid with the sweet sauce and they happen to have it with the sweet sake sauce! There was also no fishy/seafood-y after taste! It was grilled amazing and it was just overall PERFECT! We also ordered filet mignon and NY strip (they have it in sea salt or teriyaki style) THEY WERE DELICIOUS!!!!   The service was awesome as well, the server we had was very attentive and the vibe of the whole place was just real nice! They have a hibachi option if you wanna do that but we did the regular dine in. We didn't get to try their sushi but we definitely will next time we come here! I'm so happy to have found another awesome Japanese restaurant to add on to my list of faves!!  Definitely check this place out, they have a huge selection of appetizers and food besides their sushi! They also have takoyaki (i heard lots of goodies are looking for authentic takoyakis lately)",

A waste of time and food they have amazing prices but you don't even get what you pay for. I ordered (steak and shrimp no rice just veggies) I get 2 pieces of shrimp a steak with no flavor and bean sprouts!! That's it no real \"veggies\" and 2 pieces of shrimp why is it included together if you don't get a decent amount like how every place gives?! Hokkaido gives you a generous amount for free. Then the chef made no tricks at all didn't talk or even introduce himself. All we heard was \"suck a d***\" to the server thinking he was funny he laughed. Seriously the worst hibachi experience I ever had sad meal and horrible hibachi chef. Then my bf finds a hair in his rice and tells the waitress she just hands him a clean plate and never tells the chef to make him new rice, the AUDACITY! I rather go pay more and get my money's worth than come to this \"happy hour\" again.",

We were quickly greeted by the hostess and since we had a reservation we waited just a few minutes while our table was cleaned and set up.  Since the restaurant is set up Teppanyaki style  we had 2 chefs as it was a large party.  The food was very well seasoned, portions were decently sized and priced fairly reasonable.  Be sure to make a reservation as they get very busy and seating is pretty limited.  I would recommend Musashi if you are looking for a reasonably priced mean and a fun night out!",

    "text": "What a fantastic flavorful and fun experience. If you enjoy or have never been to hibachi style dining this is a blast. There are several options of proteins or vegetarian if you're ok with a shared grill (this happens anyway at most places but you're not watching).  The chef prepares so many delectable sauces- nearly 10 to accompany the food as you go. The neat part of this experience is that it was continuous throughout our meal rather than the traditional watch clap eat routine.  There is plenty of food so paying $5 to share is not a bad thing.   The flavors were amazing robust and mouth watering. I am certain there is a lot of MSG which contributes to the flavor however if you're sensitive to this as is my husband you may be wired and awake for the remainder of the night.   The bartender is very friendly and was a joy to be around. I'm unsure if it's truth or salesmanship but the bartender kept pushing the priciest selection as the \"better \" option. The only other thing that needs to be mentioned is that cleanliness of the surroundings is not a strong suit when it comes to the floors and washrooms. You can probably read heavily into this and I did not actually look for a sanitation grade but as long as you're not MSG weak, the experience of this place and the flavor of the food are a win and make it an awesome place for a special occasion in large or small groups.",

It may not be mentioned in rap songs and have the upscale interior that Benihana does, but this place is full of quality, creativity and is overall, a fun environment.   There are a lot of different options as far as proteins and vegetarian go. My personal favorite is the filet mignon, which is soft and tender. The sauces are flavorful. The chef will usually give you about 5-6 different sauces, some of which they came up with.   If you don't want to spend a significant amount on teppanyaki, I recommend coming here for their late night menu, which is from 12AM-3AM. You'll definitely get a bang for your buck.   Additionally, this is a great place to celebrate a birthday. The chefs are hilarious and will customize the dining experience, making it a fun birthday celebration. I always recommend this place to people when they want to do teppanyaki for their birthday.",

    "text": "We decided to visit here after reading so much about how great it was on Yelp! and although it was off the beaten path we hunted it down on our second or third night in Vegas.  My wife has recently really gotten into Japanese food and we have eaten quite a bit of it so we figured we may as well try one of the best Japanese places in Vegas.  Because of the low prices and unique ability to eat Japanese at 2am we decided to do some gambling and then go for a very late night Japanese and arrived at the place right before the 2am special began.  It was a bit of a dive place for sure but it didn't really feel unsafe or anything.  When we went in the place definitely did strike me as sort of a dive place and it was semi-busy at 2am (but then isn't just about everything busy in Vegas at crazy hours?)  We were greeted promptly and seated within about 15 minutes.  I must say I did notice a bit of an old, musty smell combined with propane and it was not really a great smell.  Nothing too terrible but it was annoyance to me the entire time we were there.    Of course we were seated with another family who was there with all of their children (I guess even children don't sleep in the city of Sin!) and after a while of waiting got our chef.  A very American looking chef, not at all Asian and although he was nice, he did seem like he was on the long end of a shift or perhaps working the red eye just wasn't his thing but he seemed to struggle to be interested.  My wife got the shrimp with Soba noodles and I got the chicken hibachi.  Both were pretty good and the portions were large enough.  All in all this place seemed to be a bit overrated for what it is.  It wasn't terrible or anything (although the smell really was a bit of a turn-off for me) but it seems like perhaps the place was once a really amazing place and has slipped a bit.  Or maybe we just came on an off night.    This place may be worth checking out simply for the historical value and a lot of celebrities have eaten here but for the money you are paying I would think one could find better Japanese steakhouses in Vegas.",

I will not mention the chef's name here but will leave it up to Tiger to find out based on the time I mentioned. Our hibachi chef was sloppy on the grill. Sauces were dripping out of the grill and dipping conrainers and rice was flying out of the grill. I ordered the salmon and previous chefs always cook it covered to keep it moist then they remove and cook the salmon skin as an extra crunch. This time, this chef just cooked it on the grill which made it dry. Very dissapointing as this was our go-to hibachi in town. I hope this is not the new norm. All I could remember is how messy this chef was.",

Near the strip for driving, insane to walk there in summer heat!",

But it's nice that they also have a full sushi menu and an extensive sake selection. Good for late nights, last call is at 3am. My only complaint is that the ice cream that came at the end of my meal was microscopic. I'm talking the size of a ping pong ball, and they only had chocolate or vanilla and I was hoping they'd have green tea.",

    "text": "Teppanyaki is ALWAYS a fun time.  Can't beat food, drinks, entertainment and FIRE!    We made an 8:30pm reservation less than an hour before and were seated at a full table.  My wife got the filet mignon/shrimp combo.  I got the NY strip/salmon combo.  The fried rice is $3.50 and well worth it.  We were also served a bevy of vegetables including zucchini, onions, mushrooms and bean sprouts all cooked to perfection.  I actually preferred the sirloin over filet here since they chop it up and put a lot of sauce on it.  We were also able to try a portion of the scallops due to a wrong order and those were really good too.    I get Misti Y's \"shabby\" comment regarding the interior.  The teppanyaki area felt kind of basementy but you kind of forget about it once the chef starts.  The bar area seemed pretty makeshift too.  It wasn't exactly an area you'd spend an hour at.    On a side note, maybe it's me being a snob but I scoff at people that order well done steaks.  I know it's a personal choice that I should respect but why would you want to do that to a steak?  No less than 4 people at our table ordered well done!  Their raw cuts of filet looked quite different than the others that ordered rare or medium rare.  Lower quality perhaps?  3 people also straight up didn't want any vegetables even in their fried rice.  Grown people!  More for the rest of us!!",

    "text": "I've been coming to Musashi's for about 3 years, and normally the food (both Teppan side and Sushi side) is an A+.    On my last visit we ate at the Sushi side, and noticed the sushi chef was not the same guy.  This reflected on my personal favorite dish: The Ahi Poke salad.  Four of us ordered the poke and found it to be extremely peppery and spicy hot.  Yes, Poke should have a kick, but none of us were able to enjoy it.  We commented to the chef and waiter the extreme spiciness, and even said every time we go to Vegas (which is multiple times a year) we always stop at Musashi and order the Poke salad.  The chef actually gave me a negative feedback by saying that is how HE does it, and didn't apologize.  I was upset at how he dismissed my complaint. He didn't bother to re-do my dish, and I know he could hear my table's entire conversation at our displeasure (we were sitting next to the Sushi bar!).    I know the chef changed because even the presentation of the salad was different.  I will go back to Musashi, but next time I order the Ahi Poke salad, I will specify to not be so peppery, and not be so \"red hot\" spicy.   I still am fuming over the last visit, and hope that Musashi will address this review.",

Try all the sauces he makes from scratch right in front of you! He was fantastic. He was hilarious and entertaining the hole way through. The food was delicious and everyone at our table was raving about this place the whole night.  We arrived and sat at the bar while we waited for our table. We met Cindy behind the bar and she took great care of us. She was also very friendly and accommodating. The rest of the experience was a blur of sore cheeks from laughing so hard, bursts of flames, spinning knives, and a handful of dirty jokes. We had a great time.  Musashi is located in a strip mall just off the strip. Super understated but well worth the trip. Not only will your dollar go farther here than in the hotels but the food is stellar. I'm definitely looking to come back here next time I'm in town. Don't forget to tip your servers!",

    "text": "I decided to treat my boyfriend to dinner and thought that it would be a great idea to try something different. I did my research and asked a friend for a teppanyaki recommendation and apparently this was the place to go to.   Upon arriving I had made reservations earlier today for 6:30 dinner. The lady who picked up the phone wasn't very professional, but I was able to reserve a table. By the time we had arrived no one was present at the front to welcome us to the restaurant. We had to stand by the counter waiting for someone to seat us. After a staff member finally greeted us, we told her about our reservations. She had to check if there was an open table by the kitchen after we were told through the phone that there was one available for us. She then said \"sorry your table was stolen.\" We were hoping to receive maybe a discount on our order or perhaps receive free dessert for the inconvenience, but she just told us to sit anywhere and didn't even walk us to our table.   After that rough greeting to our first time at Musashi we finally had our orders taken and we were a bummed that we couldn't have teppanyaki tonight. So we ended up ordering rolls and to our surprise they were very tasty. My personal favorite was the Party N Ur Mouth. It was a roll with deep fried banana, tuna, crab, and sweet mayo. I thought it was unusual at first but we ordered it anyway. And boy was it delicious! We had also ordered the rainbow roll and the porn star.   Although we had received poor customer service, we surely enjoyed the food. I would definitely come back to try their teppanyaki. And maybe for more of that Party N Ur Mouth.",

We sat in the empty sushi section and had a taste testing of a bunch of sake infused with fruit (syrup).  The peach and lychee were my favorite.    i ordered the ribeye and the BD ordered the NY strip.  Performance wise - it was nothing I haven't seen before.  The beef broth soup was tasty, the salad was forgettable, the shrimp was doused with a mayo based sauce that I really enjoyed but BD hates mayo, the quail egg and bacon appetizer was also on the meh side.    My ribeye was super tasty.  He put it on a bed of sliced garlic and let that bad boy sear.  Before he served it to me he sprinkled it with lime juice.  It was yummy.  My fried rice was bland until I added 4 other sauces to it and the veggies were great.  The BD enjoyed his steak but didn't really eat much else (he doesn't do veggies or seafood - so more for me!)  All in all, I've had better elsewhere and though it wasn't bad by any means, nothing was memorable and it's ranked pretty low compared to other teppanyaki places I've eaten before.",

The chef wasn't that good at doing his little tricks, but he was still entertaining. It was during normal hours, and I fell in love with their fried rice and mushrooms.  Three days later, I came really late at night during their happy hour. We ordered about the same amount food like last time. The server told us it's 50% off so we get half the portions, but it's the same exact food as the normal menu. So we ordered twice as much.   Here comes the chef who looked at us like, \"great some of my customers are 12 year olds.\" Just because we look young, doesn't mean you start downgrading your service (I despise servers like that, and yes, we do look like 12 year olds). I told him twice before he started that no onions on any of our food (my bf is allergic), and he said, \"I'm going to put lots of onions.\" He said it in a joking way, but I said it again after just to be sure. He started doing his thing, and he cooked fried rice for the other customers first WITH onions and then he used to same grill to cook our fried rice without cleaning it. The previous chef we had was not like that. He acknowledged our request, and he put us first. Our fried rice had onions...good thing we're smart enough to check. He got even worse when it came to the veggies. He cooked the veggies all at once for everybody, and gave us veggies with onions. Then he goes, \"It might have a little onion.\" After that I was so done. I wasn't going to complain anymore because to me this restaurant doesn't exist. I was planning on taking my family here for my graduation dinner, but no thanks. He didn't even give us any mushrooms...he gave all the mushrooms to everybody else. I love mushrooms. I thought we were supposed to get the exact same thing as regular menu. We paid the same amount we did for the regular menu. I hate this place with a burning passion. Please, train your chefs what \"No onions!\" mean, and how to provide service.",

I walked in when the restaurant was nearly empty, with family from out of town, and was rudely told there would be a 30 min wait. Before I could question why, the owner had turned and left the hostess stand. We waited approximately 15 minutes, didn't see a soul before we finally decided that they were rude, unapologetic and we would take our business to a restaurant that wanted customers. A side note, this was a place I frequented and the owners knew my name.",

Go later and ask for the naughty show.  It's so much fun! We've been here multiple times with friends and guests visiting.  My favorite is the salmon.  Tiger always makes the salmon skin such a tasty, crunchy perfection. He makes tons of sauces right in front of your eyes.  The quality of the food is awesome.  It's so delicious!!",

Seriously I had made these rsvp several days ago they didn't even have the courtesy to call and let us know about the delay which they knew about because they were short a chef! I was very disappointed, but my group was not going to wait 50mins to eat because of their mistake! The sad part was this was a wed and they weren't even that busy they should have made the call and then we just would have showed up later. Oh and to make matters worst they didn't even seat us at an empty hibachi which I saw at least two that was empty! Really really bad customer service training! They had parking but it was very limited with all the other stores in the shopping center.",

We've watched him evolve into a really great sushi chef, and we really like the interaction we have here. Be sure to inquire as to the \"belly\" fish on hand - it's the best sushi.  Happy hour starts at 11:00 pm till 4:00 am - and they have a special menu for the occasion, meaning that two can eat very well for $30.00 or less.   Never eaten at the Tappan bar, so can't comment on that side of the house.",

Therefore, i do my best to eat teppan when i find someplace new, and I found mushashi through Yelp on a birthday trip to vegas a couple of weeks ago.  My wife and I made reservations for 5pm because we were going to the 7pm Phantom at Venetian and we wanted to give ourselves plenty of time to eat and drink before we headed to the show.  When we got there, we found the place empty, they had just opened up so we were the first customers there (note: by the time we left there were about 10 others) but they were very nice about only having 2 ppl at a huge teppan table.  We sat down and my wife ordered the rib eye and i got the seafood special w/ calamari, lobster, shrimp, etc.  The food was perfectly cooked and was  much better quality than i've had at other teppan places.  I'm not that into the show but that was better than any other place i've been to as well.    If you're looking for good teppan w/ good quality food then this is the place.  service was great and the food was even better.",

The dining room is nice a cozy with soothing traditional music in the background.  My waitress was very polite, attentive and friendly. The selection of rolls were impressive and well made.  The fish was fresh and as usual I ordered more than I could handle -- I just wanted to sample as much as I can on the menu.  Sure it's off the strip, but the food and service were good and the prices are very reasonable. They even have happy hour and late night specials and the restaurant is open until 3am.

I got fried rice, lobster tail, and filet mignon.  Even the vegetables were excellent.   The service: Subpar.  I made reservations for 8, and we still waited about an hour from the moment we entered the restaurant until the chef showed up.  When you walk in, the smell is pretty bad, like rotting fish or something.  The staff was very polite though.  However, we had a chef who could not stop making pretty vulgar sexual innuendos to the ladies in our group, making them very uncomfortable.  It was highly unprofessional, and it didn't stop even after he was done cooking.",

I originally read the reviews for this place (which is why my boyfriend and I went there... sorry babe) and being that it was one of the highest rated sushi restaurants in Vegas on here, that's what we decided on. Now it seems like a lot of people have rated it highly based on the teppenyaki side but as far as sushi goes, it was simply the worst sushi either of us has ever had. The mussels in which I've never had a truly bad experience with, were falling apart and mushy. I don't know how to even describe the rolls! They were just weird and and the fish was sooooo NOT fresh! I've read peoples reviews saying how fresh it was and I dunno if they came on a good day or maybe they've just never had good sushi before but this stuff was just terrible! Also on the website it actually talks about their unique and modern interior decoration... HELLO!! There we holes in the seats of the booths and the lighting was a bright florescent light hanging right above your head literally blinding you! The place was just downright dull and dreary.  Look, I have never left a review for anywhere before because I've never felt the need to and I've had plenty of bad experiences in different restaurants before, but I absolutely LOVE sushi and this place was just horrible in every way. PLEASE don't bother wasting your time in going there if sushi is what you want. I can't say anything about the teppanyaki side but oh lord... bad sushi. Bad, bad, bad, bad, bad.",

They also offer Kobe beef, which was so yummy!!  I will definitely come here every time we come back to Vegas, for the amazing food, and also for a very entertaining show!  Our entire table enjoyed ourselves, and haven't laughed so hard in a long time! Go with a group, it's much more fun!

The service was at first prompt.  During and after we were finished eating though it took forever for our waters to be filled and our server disappeared and turned into a hispanic man.  I guess they save the fancy cloth napkins for their evening diners though because we got the cheapo paper napkins.  We didn't get a fancy show because it was just us in the restaurant and because it was the lunch menu.    All-in-all it was a pleasant experience and I'm willing to go back for dinner some day.",

I was a little nervous about this place because I knew it was small and off the strip so sometimes you never know what you will get.  There isn't much curb appeal with this place, it's in a small strip mall, but don't judge the book by it's cover.  The inside of the restaurant was clean and dimly lit.  They have 2 huge grill tables on one side of the restaurant that seat about 16 people at each.    Just about everyone in the group ordered either the filet or the \"musashi special\" and everyone in our party would give the food at least a 5 star rating.  The homemade sauces were all excellent.  I'm still trying to figure out what some of them were, but they were all delicious.  The chef did a good job of explaining them as he was making them but i'm pretty sure i was already half in the bag from the numerous bottles of wine we had.    Funny thing is, a few weeks after we came back from Vegas, this place was on \"Steak Paradise\" on the travel channel and our server was the one featured on the show.  I can't remember his name but he was awesome!  I don't think i stopped laughing for more than a few minutes during the meal, other than to stuff some delicious lobster, steak, prawns, or scallops in my mouth.  The food was to die for.    It was a little pricey, but everything in vegas is.  The food was definitely worth it and the entertaining show put on by the chef made the evening unforgettable.  If you have a group of people in vegas, make a reservation and go enjoy yourself at Musashi.  You won't be disappointed!",

Go there yourself and find out :) Never tried sushi here, only Teppan Yaki, spent about $40/person, left full and satisfied mentally and physically. Been a while since I visited here, I think I should return soon.",

    "text": "Went here on Mother's day, had such a great time. I have read a few bad reviews about the service, but I experienced the exact opposite! First, we were sat down by our server David. He was really nice, easy to talk to and was great at recommending dishes. So to begin our meal he brought out a delicious salad and soup. This beef soup was so flavorful and my favorite dish overall!As appetizers we got the calamari tempura(good), and a bacon,shrimp skewer(great).Since it was Mother's Day all the moms got a complimentary Saki. Which I had never tried, bit strong for me since I don't drink but definitely much appreciated. For our entree, I got the shogun special and finally our chef came out to prepare our meal. Whats so great about this place is that it is not all about the food, its also about these chefs showing their passion, and doing what they love, right in front of you! Of course all those amazing sauces were both fun and delicious. There was not one I didn't like. My favorite was prob the yum yum w/ hot sauce! My Steak , was delicious as well as my chicken teriyaki. The chef even let me try some shrimp someone else had ordered!! I don't remember his name unfortunately but he was from Guadalajara. Overall, fun, unique, and the staff makes you feel at home. I will be back probably try their sushi next time!",

I don't know if there's another place in Vegas that serves live uni straight out of the shell. The apple saki is very yummy! It's a perfect blend. It's not sweet or too strong. Just right. Their sushi is fresh and they don't add too much rice to the nigiri which is a plus. The sushiman is just as friendly as the teppan chefs. The four star comes from their service... which is pretty slow at times.",

The chef who made our food obviously wanted to be anywhere but there. The food tasted good but the portions were really small. I had the chicken & shrimp, which was $4 more than the chicken, and received only 4 shrimp. My family joked the rest of the day I paid $1 per shrimp. We will not be going back, too many better options in Las Vegas.",

    "text": "Three of us had a portion of one teppan table shared with another couple and a regular who had been working for the WSOP or something.  First off, the food was amazing.  Meats were all tender (filet mignon melted in my mouth, but the NY steaks were pretty good too), very well seasoned, and the multitudes of sauce were all delicious. A little disappointed with their 'hot' sauce. It was good and probably my second favorite after the garlic one, but it couldn't pass for mild at an Asian restaurant. I ordered the plain ole steamed rice instead of friend rice like everyone else because most teppan places just give you some butter+soy sauce rice with some veggies tossed in. I think the chef forgot and just made all the rice into fried rice, so he just gave me and my friend some, and I was pleasantly surprised.  We didn't get the main chef, so our show wasn't as impressive.  He tried some tricks, but he occasionally slipped up. He generally made up for with the conversation we had, until he got going with the regular at the table and the conversation steered toward strip clubs and pot. The girlfriend wants to come back and get the full show from the master himself.",

    "text": "Simply amazing still, newly remodeled and by far the best place to eat in Vegas (we are tourists who have eaten here over 10 times in the last 4 years.  We just returned from a trip to Vegas where we ate dinner here two nights in a row.  We had two different chefs, yet both meals were great as usual.  The second night we had Chef Ray who made a few extra sauces and added spices to the meal which were to die for.    This restaurant has the best Fried Rice, Salad and hibachi Filet I have ever tasted.  And my wife thinks they have the best soup around.  So adding that all up, you can't find a better Hibachi steakhouse.  Our meal totaled less than $100 plus tip, which for two people is also pretty hard to find in Vegas.    If you can get the owner Chef Tiger, you will be in for a real treat, but every chef we have had has been great and I can't suggest this place enough.  Best Restaurant in America!!!",

We asked and apparently they are open really late and cater to the casino crowd getting off at midnight.    Anyways the first two times were excellent - unlike the other reviewers we didn't do teppenyaki and instead sat in the adjacent dining room.  They have a full fare menu from steaks to izakaya.   We ordered numerous dishes and almost everything was delicious.  This comes at a price of 30-50 a person keep in mind so it better be tasty.  The third time we went we brought some family and the service was really bad - which is really crazy since the waitress even knew someone in our party.  It is a massive pet peeve of mine when service is poor and the restaurant is straight up empty.  This put a damper on the night, since a dish or two had to go back and it got painful.  *sigh*.  It woulda been 4 stars.  Why can't we find somewhere as good as Ichiza without a 45 minute wait!",

For all the dippers out there, they make amazing dipping sauces. I had their ribeye and lobster tail...excellent. Their hidden gem was their soup which is very unique because of their added steak. The chef was rated R humorous (which I can see be taken offensively) during his show. Steaks are superb. Will definitely return to this place when we return to Vegas. Just a tip, the place is slightly off the strip. I advise taking a taxi and then letting them know to get a taxi for you when the bill arrives which we did and it was seamless. We loved it!!!",

Well, I was there for a dance competition and the night we got to Vegas me and my family was starving! Oh handy Yelp to the rescue! There was no way we were going to eat at a chain restaurant so I looked up a local place. I picked Musashi and really hoped it was going to be good.  Oh and it was! Their shrimp is to dieeee for. No joke. What is it they cook it with, honey mustard? Whatever it is, it is TASTY. I had Filet Mignon, my brother had NY steak w/ Scallops, mama had the same but with prawns, and pops had it with a salmon fillet. I tried a piece of their food and they were all good. Oh and DO choose the fried rice over steamed! Their fried rice was so yummy.  Conclusion? This place beats Benihana any day. I personally don't even like Benihana and this place just hits the teppanyaki spot. I've been exposed to pretty good Teppanyaki spots back in Guam, and it's good to know that there's one in the mainland that is just as good. Plus the service was great! Maybe we were lucky, but my parents never had an empty cup of hot tea. Now our check was huge (like YUUUUUGE), but it was worth it.  Did I mention our chef was cute and entertaining?",

Apparently Musashi had a lunch special going on, $9.50 for a bento box - which was quite expensive compared to $.8.50 at RA by the Fashion Show Mall considering this place offered quite a shady atmosphere. It was a little secluded and just...dark for the most part, not exactly the kind of environment that favors a happy dining experience.   We ordered a bento with a choice of tonkatsu (pork cutlet) and shrimp/vegetable tempura. It came with miso soup, a potsticker, edamame and salad. Since we weren't too hungry, we asked for an extra bowl of rice only to find out later that additional rice orders were free...and for that I gave this review an extra star. The food was pretty good although I'd recommend Go Wild Sushi and Grill (on Tenaya and Sahara) a thousand folds over Musashi, taking everything into consideration.   At some point, we noticed how the place needed quite a make-over. The booth couches were ripping and the music wasn't very accomodating. Summing everything up, the restaurant left quite a lasting impression that won't have me going back for awhile. If you want better Japanese Restaurants, I'd recommend shuseki in Chinatown, RA at the Fashion Show Mall and Go Wild Sushi and Grill along Sahara to name a few.",

Some classic hibachi technics and some I haven't seen before but I was so surprised that he cared enough to ask how we liked things flavored! And I swear, I've never had so many delicious sauces to try. I will surely recommend this too all of my friends that visit Vegas!",

    "text": "Musashi's was on one of the travel/ Food channels, can't remember which one but they were on there and when people from out of town visit, they request to eat here. Reservations are recommended because sometimes, even with a reservation, you can wait 45 mins to an hour... Yea, it's happened to us. What can you do, they're popular!   The place has a noticeably funky smell as soon as you enter the restaurant, like gas or something... But once you're seated, you're away from that area and all seems fine.   Service is always great and they're real friendly. It's a but pricey, for two people, you can spend about $70-$90 for food and non-alcoholic drinks. My husband usually does the Teppanyaki and I order sushi.   From what I've heard, Musashi is known for their sauces, for Teppanyaki. Those sauces are GREAT. There was a lemon garlic sauce that they made and it was AWESOME. I love garlic. Sushi isn't bad. I always order the spicy scallop roll.   On occasion, you can see a local celebrity, someone that performs on the strip... i.e. that magician, can't remember his name though... LOL   Great once in awhile, guaranteed to burn a hole in your pockets if you eat here all the time.",

They have two types of shows to see the clean show and the dirty show (usually plays later at night when no kids are there), both shows are fun and entertaining. Throughout the show they do lots of tricks and they make amazing sauces that you won't get anywhere else.  Not only is their teppan fantastic and soooooooooo soooooooooo yummy their sushi is amazing also our favorite roll to get is the wet dream. Their  food and service will literally leave you longing for the next time you get to go!",

For all three the salmon was super fresh and had an excellent taste. We also ordered pork gyoza which I enjoyed but the wife not so much, and Beef Negimaki  which were ok but the wife liked more than me. I would stick with the sushi or sashimi here. The service was friendly and efficient. I thought that the prices were reasonable. Overall, it was a very good experience. If I stay in that part of Vegas again I would definitely consider returning.",

This time around I took my family who's never had a teppanyaki style dinner before. I made reservations for 8pm last night, and we got there 30 minutes early. We were really happy that they were able to sit is right  away and we didn't have to wait another 30min.  The service was great. But the chef we got was disappointing. First, he talked really low and I couldn't hear the jokes that were part of the act. Ok.. That's not such a big problem. But as he was going through the whole thing I noticed he skipped a lot of tricks or special maneuvers. Mind you, I'm an avid eater at teppanyaki places and the acts everywhere are pretty much the same. So to see that he skipped the beating heart part, broke my heart. He also skipped a number of things too, that I was looking forward for my family to witness. Again, they've never had this type of dinner/show before let alone been to Vegas.  Maybe the act isn't mandatory or the chefs don't have to have jokes and special gestures? I don't know. I just felt kind of let down.   Other than that, the food was amazing.",

The rest of the staff was attentive and kept our drinks full and our dishes bussed in a very timely manner.   The chef made each person at the table a bunch of different sauces for dipping.  There must have been about a dozen different flavors of them. He then proceeded to cook our food but not until he showed his mastery of the cutlery by tossing his knives, forks, and spatulas around with prowess of a ninja.  This went on throughout the preparation of our dinners.  He also made lots of different sauces on the grill that he used to spice our rice, meat, and veggies.   The various meats were cooked to order and were also spiced or flavored as requested.  We all left the place with smiles on our faces and full bellies.   We didn't have reservations but they were able to squeeze us in. So reservations are highly recommended. If they weren't able to squeeze us in it would have been a two hour wait.  There was no wait if you were there for sushi.   Highly recommend and will visit again next time I find myself in Vegas.",

    "text": "Awful experience.  We arrived a little before midnight and the host looked like he was not in the mood to work. We asked for a place for two and my husband asked about being sitted where they set the food on fire, excuse my memory but I can't remember the name of that place but I know it's not the bar, and the host looked like he didn't like us asking, he looked really unhappy. Asked us for a moment and then came back to walk us there. Everybody looked like they were not happy to see us and nobody said hello or smiled at us. Just a reminder, it's not  \"all you can eat\", it wasn't happy hour time and the place is expensive, so if we were still willing to have dinner there I would appreciate not feeling like  we were not welcome or bothering them. We sat down but I immediately asked my husband if we could go somewhere else, such a heavy vibe. Nobody but the host said goodbye either. Zero appreciation. We crossed the parking lot and went to sushi way, which is cheaper, has the \"all you can eat\" option and a very friendly staff.",

Fried rice is not something that I could have compared with other place. Soooo good with yum yum sauce; please do try, you are welcome. Everything was good, food and the chef. Price is a bit out of the range, but it definitely is worth it and you are going to come out happy with your huge tummy. :)",

    "text": "We came here to celebrate an occasion with friends and arrived 5 mins into our reservation. Rather than be greeted by the hostess, we were told that she needed to seat us right now as tables needed turning this evening. Despite being a few minutes late, I wasn't expecting to be treated like an inconvenience as we walked in. Not a great start!  We were led around the main seating area to the Hibachi tables and a server called Sam greeted us - with a smile this time - to offer menus and take drink/ food orders. The menu is very comprehensive and the restaurant offers specials where you can combine your choice of meat and seafood, which was great! On the menu, the NY steak combo is only $3 cheaper than the filet so we 'pushed the boat out' and went with the filet and some scallops, as well as some hot sake, a wine and a beer. The drinks were unfortunately unimpressive. The wine tasted very cheap and my partner, who loves sake, said that the taste left a lot to be desired too. A real shame, but as the chef arrived to start cooking, we were looking forward to the food redeeming things.  I can't remember the chefs name, but he was initially pleasant and very chatty. As the evening went on and he got a few laughs (including from myself) as he was quite funny at first, he decided to step up his jokes and humour, fancying himself as quite the comedian. Unfortunately his idea of jokes turned into mimicking and mockery that came at the expense of some at the table and at the restaurant, which wasn't much funny or appreciated.  His attempts at standup meant that his concentration wasn't totally on the cooking at hand. My order didn't include shrimp as I have a mild allergy, but some ended up on my plate anyway. It was no problem to just hand them over to my partner's plate alongside the shrimp he'd been given, even though he didn't order any either.  The scallops we had been given were nice, but very small so they ended up being a little chewy. Thankfully the steak was great and the chef had taken a minute out of making jokes to cook that really well. We also really loved the sauces that came with the food. There were 4 and each were different and delicious.  To sum up, this hibachi restaurant is good, but pretty average when considering others around the Valley. Of course your experience is different depending on the chef you get and unfortunately ours wasn't as attentive as he could've been.  If you're in the area and have a craving, give it a go! They're open late which is good. I feel the service is better elsewhere though.",

(Especially if you're a Birthday Girl or a Bride-to-Be!)   I won't spoil the fun by revealing the intimate details beneath this place's towel-concealed toys, but let's just say that the photos and videos from that evening will serve as fabulous blackmail in the future!   That said, don't worry if you're coming here as a Family Affiar, the chefs also have a PG version of their presentation and are very cognicent of all the guest's enjoying their evening at any given time. However, keep in mind that Musashi is open until 2:30AM, and the later into the night it gets, the rowdier the crowd (and the raunchier the show!)   Our chef for the night was \"Yung\" (apologies for any misspelling...no one would write his name down for me!) and he was, hands down, the BEST hibachi chef I've ever had. While it's True that the ambiance is not as glamorous as Benihana, the price, experience and service cannot be beat!   One of our guests had a shellfish allergy and Yung was very intentional about the order in which he cooked our food and thorough in ensuring that the grill was properly cleaned and that nothing was contaminated; none of this detracted from our overall experience, at all.  Most of our table got the standard chicken and veggies with fried rice, but even the miso soup and ginger dressing appetizer were delicious to start off our meal! I also recommend the green apple sake (which I preferred over the lychee flavor.) But, remember that it is bad luck to pour your own - so make friends at the table and pour a cup for your neighbor!   Expect to spend about an two hours here start to finish, and when the check comes, the gratuity is most likely already included.  Finally, the location is a little difficult to find, even as a local driving myself I struggled to find it with Google Maps, so be prepared to help direct your Uber Driver if you request a pick up!",

The first time I was here, we were lucky enough to have the owner as our chef. I remember seeing him on the Travel Channel. He's a very friendly and funny guy. He will tell plenty of dirty jokes, if the crowd is right. The food was very good, and the sauces for the meat/veggies were great! I had the steak, chicken and shrimp dinner. After the rest of our table left, the owner talked to us for a while. Since I was planning to move to Vegas, he was giving me some advice. A very cool guy, and I have no problem supporting his restaurants.   The second time I was here, it was very late, and I was drunk, so the experience was very different. There was only one teppanyaki table available that late, and it was full. We sat at a regular table and ordered off of the regular menu. I honestly don't remember what I ordered, but I remember it taking a bit of time. There were more customers than I thought there would be at 1am, so service was a bit slow. The server lady was on the odd side, but very funny. She did apologize for the slow service. I didn't hold it against her, since she was the only person taking care of the tables. I have no problem recommending this place, and I'll return for sure.",

    "text": "Musashi features two styles of dining with a traditional table experience and the Hibachi experience to enjoy. The table experience is like many other Japanese restaurants featuring a list of Sake Martinis, hot or cold sake, Japanese beers and a menu of fresh made sushi that's sure to please. Service is prompt and professional with little on the side of entertainment. The highlight of Musashi is their Hibachi grill side. Each section can house 5 to 8 people while servers come by for promptly delivered drinks. The stars of the show are the chefs and a show you will get. You get to watch the chefs fire up the grill and put on a show, flipping their tools around, cracking eggs with style and setting fire to a tower of onions. Not only is the cooking experience fun to watch but the Chefs have a great sense of humor. I dare say this is an experience for adults as you'll hear many adult jokes along with a prop or two that come in... Ahem, phallic design? The Chefs may as well be part time comedians and you are the heckler. You'll be laughing and smiling as you're served fresh made sauces, rice, and your choice of meats ranging from beef, chicken, and seafoods. Whatever magic they perform on the rice works as it is filled with flavor. The filet mignon melts in your mouth. I suppose the biggest variance is that each time I've come here the flavors have been a bit different. On some days better than others but always enjoyable. Knock your socks off with some Sake, seat yourself while you enjoy the Japanese atmosphere and prepare to have a good time with your friends.",

I made a reservation and they told me If I'm late 10min and we were late 8min, but they made us wait another 30min(set somebody else who came without reservation, I guess) And all the cooking process started after may be 40min. Me and my family had a very strict schedule and we were late for other shows. Lack of service, that's what I can tell(don't care about the customers). I had a soup after 20min and still were waiting for the cooking process to begin.",

Check out the wall of celebrity photos on your way in, it's pretty cool.   I like to start with Hot Sake and Kirin. A few of my favorites are the \"WTF\" and \"Wet Dream\" roll. If you're in the mood for some meat, I recommend the Aspara-Beef. It's really good. I ordered two the last time I was here (fatty lol).   I always seem to miss happy hour but if you can remember, they offer late HH 12-3:30am (close), so try to time it right if you plan to visit. And make reservations if you're having teppanyaki, seating is limited.",

    "text": "One general rule for restaurants should be: Don't place a collection of Yankee Candles on your hostess stand. From the moment we entered, all I could smell and taste was an overpowering potpourri that reminded me of the cheapest commercial grade bathroom cleaner. As we were leaving, I located the culprit, 2 giant Yankee Candles blazing away. I am not sure why the candles were necessary, but the scent severely undermined my dining experience.  I thought the interior was shabby. I can't explain it, perhaps it all goes back to the scent, but I just got a bad vibe from the surroundings. I requested a wine list, and it had stains. All the little details just added up to a less than amazing impression.  As for the food, I think the main attraction here is the \"Kobe,\" but I was not in the mood for meat, so I opted for the vegetarian entree, which was surprisingly $2 more than the chicken. It did include tofu, a surprising find. I am sure that the food differs greatly from chef to chef, but everything was overseasoned with white pepper. I can handle a small dash of white pepper, but in large quantities, I do not care for the taste. Every item had a heavy dousing of white pepper, so I did not love anything. The chef did create a series of special sauces with sesame seeds, and they were pretty tasty, but the white pepper flavor was there too!   Our chef was nice, but I am not a fan of sexual innuendos while dining. Call me a prude! Our chef only made the occasional innuendo, but one was directed at me... gross! And, I saw the chef at the adjacent table shape the fried rice into a giant penis and sprinkle \"hair\" on top. This might be hilarious for some people, but I just think it is odd. Yeah, I am that girl that doesn't appreciate penis jokes. However, I accept that some people find them clever.  This is a generous 3 stars simply because my husband enjoyed his salmon, and our waiter was nice. He brought me a new glass of wine when I thought the first one was spoiled. Plus, the white pepper thing may be a personal preference. There is also the possibility that the sushi is good, and they are open until 4am, which is worth at least one star.",

    "text": "My husband and I were recently in Las Vegas on vacation.  We've been to Vegas about a dozen times, and we wanted our last dinner in Vegas to be Tepanyaki.  There are certainly a lot of options for this in Vegas, but we decided to trust our fellow Yelpers and check this place out.    When we first arrived just before 6 on a Sunday our host asked if we had reservations.  We were a bit surprised since there was only one other party in the restaurant.  We were seated right away, and the other family at the table spoke so highly of the food we were about to eat that we really began to be excited.    The food was absolutely incredible.  I'm not sure if this is True everywhere, but certainly where we are from in NH you find that a lot of the flavor and seasoning is from soy sauce when you have Tepanyaki.  Unfortunately a lot of Tepanyaki in NH tastes the same.  But man was I impressed by this place!  I've never seen food seasoned and flavored the way it was here.  Flavors were layered and built in such a way that each thing I tasted was better than the last thing.  I had the Shrimp and Scallops and my husband had the Steak and Chicken.  Everything was fresh and the flavors were so balanced.  Often times I get sauces on the side for Tepanayki and I need those to provide depth of flavors.  This is the first time that I've had Tepanyaki that I didn't need those side carts of sauces.  I was so full when I left, but I didn't feel gross because of an abundance of grease.    Perhaps the only feedback we could pass along to the owners are with respect to the bathrooms.  I did not use their facilities but my husband did.  While it was clear they do a nightly cleaning, some things just need a little bit of sprucing.  For example, there was a wall-mounted air freshener that clearly hadn't been replaced in a few weeks or month.  But that's such a minor detail in the grand scheme of our evening that I almost hate to bring that up.  It certainly didn't detract from the experience that we had though as you can see based on how highly I rated it.  We will definitely be making this a regular part of our trips to Vegas going forward.",

    "text": "Yup..5 stars, my one and only five stars, for now. We visited this place many moons ago and I am now just getting around to writing a review so here it is the best I remember it.   Me and my wife saw this place featured on the travel channel. We were in town for our buddys 40th bday party. We lugged everyone a short drive off the strip into a crowded strip mall deal. We walk into to a relatively empty Musashi. This place to my remembrance only has 2 hibachi tables and some a considerable amount of regular tables. If making reservations one must declare that one wants a hibachi presentation.   Due to one of the chefs calling in, there was a considerable wait to get our chef. This actually turned out to be a good thing because little did we know we would be getting the owner and the chef featured on the travel channel. We were nice and toasty by the time he got there off sapporo's and sake. The chef/owner introduces himself and immediately begins with jokes and most of the jokes were not of child nature. He picked one person from our group and playfully made fun of her the whole time like a comedian would to our amusement. The display this guy put on was phenomenal and this is coming from a Hibachi Veteran Pro. None of the tricks he displayed had I seen before. He had a cast iron rice former made out of the design of genetials, something you would have to see to believe.  I ordered the Kobe beef, I had never had it before. Needless to say it was \"market price\" and not cheap by any means but I didn't care. The mushroom soup was standard and good. The rice was the BEST I ever had. The SAUCE was absolutely amazing and blows away every sauce I have ever had.  When I got the kobe beef I let everyone at the table have a piece. Kobe beef is very fatty, very tasty and delectable as all HELL.  Overall one of the best places I have eaten in my life thus earining my first 5 star rating and I am no stranger to nice restaraunts.  If you find yourself in vegas and in the mood for this type of food do yourself a favor and skip the Hiltons Beni hana and take a cab ride over to Musashi..son, you will not be dissapoint.",

So Musashi was a LIFE SAVER. It become a weekly ritual to have my date night here with my boyfriend. The people watching is awesome, the restaurant is divided into two parts, hibachi tables in one room and sushi bar, booths and tables in the other room. I'll take TEPPANYAKI all day, because you can still order sushi rolls from the other room. You'd be surprised who you will run into here, poker players love this place!   It's not your average dining experience. You'll probably get drunk, laugh a lot  at conversations with random crazy strangers in VEGAS, and have fun playful banter with your chef.   The food is really why people keep coming back. The experience is a plus but this place is really my 'cheat meal' when I feel like indulging in fresh hibachi. They are always slammed (even in the AM) but they're generally worth the wait. Where else do I have to be at 3 am anyway? It's normally a couple hours by the time we finish our meal.   My order is standard for these places, the Musashi Special that includes a taste of pretty much everything. Miso soup, salad, rice, shrimp appetizer, Filet mignon, prawns, scallops, lobster tail, FRIED RICE and yummy ice cream. It's pricey. About $60 for my meal plus drinks but at night they have saki happy hour. 2 for 1 beer. Shots. Whatever, its great for after a long night out.",

    "text": "My go-to teppan in Vegas.   This spot stay open til like 4 AM. I never wanna eat before around 12 in Vegas, and after midnight, Musashi offers a discounted Teppan menu...You can still get the regular stuff too, but for almost half price, you get just a wee bit less food(still enough for me, and I have an appetite!)  Tiger is awesome...I think he's the owner. He's cooked for me a few times and we usually rap about the culinary industry since I work in it as well. But be warned...any pretty girls at the table and things CAN get raunchy. Part of why I love this place...They REALLY have fun...  Then, there's Tigers brother in law...Talked to me about eating Dog for a good 15 minutes...haha....Couldn't tell if he was pulling my leg or not, but I'm gonna go with yes, he was messing with me. Haha  And this one other dude is actually my favorite. He remembers which SEAT I sat in months prior, and remembers every time. I wish I knew his name, he's a cool guy. Maybe Jason? I dunno...I feel bad! You're my dude, dude!  A couple quick things...The 'Miso' soup is actually a peppered beef soup, and it's freaking delicious. My GF doesn't eat beef, but she eats this soup knowing it IS beef, because it;s THAT good. And another thing...the Fried Rice... OMG... Seriously, you guys have ruined me for all other fried rice. It's simply amazing. The best fried rice anywhere...And I usually HATE rice!  Yeah, this is my kinda spot...They don't take themselves too seriously but take their food serious as sh!t. Plus, being a late night spot, it's ideal for poker players to grab a bite after a late night at the tables. Seriously, this place rocks. I hate getting off the tables and being reduced to fast food or some Casino 24 hour Cafe. Even if I'm having a bad poker night, I can always look forward to some good Teppan at Musashi.  Thanks Tiger! I'll be out there in April sometime.",

    "text": "I can tell you this one first thing about Musashi.  The absolute best roll of sushi I remember having in all my years of sushi nom'dom was served to me from Musashi.  I believe it to be a dragon roll type variation at the time and it was prepared by a latin chef.  It may have just been right time right place right company, but my girl also still remembers just how much that one stood out.  It was a second first date of sorts, soo..  Aside from that roll.  The teppanyaki chefs are the most comical and animated here.  This being a spot that my single years most frequented I can vouch that the chefs are truly charismatic and their chef skills are a cut above.  Top notch teppanyaki.  The squid cake is tender.  The rib-eye is to die for.  *Make sure you tell the chef that you like the fat!!!* they will double grill the fat in a special sweet crunchy way and your tongue will remember it more than your first real kiss.    The teppan menus range from traditional price ranges and make sure to dish out for the Musashi special or the Tsutomu if you are pesceterian like me.  Since it is a shared table, when the chef is done with everyone elses meats then he continues to pull out additional entree's for your upper tier special you will immediately see the faces of envy upon your fellow diners!  Mwahaha!  Make sure to drop a few Sake bombs down your Hiroshima to make the mood perfect.  Traditional kimono adorned waitresses will attend to your buzz for the night and I can't stress how much fun you can have at Musashi may usually equate to a taxi cab or recommended designated driver.  The night is young, or it may not be.  They do open quite late to satisfy Vegas' party people which is also another plus.  I will have to admit that I haven't seen that young latin phantom chef since.  The one that cut and rolled the most prodigious piece of delectable sushi I have or may possibly ever have had in my young adult life.  However I may keep coming back to Musashi my entire lifetime.  Enjoying all the other good things that they offer, and give a glance back to the sushi counter in hopes to demystify the fabled sushi shogun.",

It was great! had an Asahi and a Pina Colada.  We paid at the bar and moved to our teppanyaki table.  I had the $15 chicken and shrimp dinner meal. All the meals include miso soup, fried rice and vegetables. My friend ordered NY Strip and Shrimp. She loved it! The chef was entertaining, nice and cooked everything to everyone's liking. This is a local gem. Go when it's late and ask for the Dirty show if you want to go for a special occasion.",

We decided to go one night during happy hour (which, I believe, is from 12a to 4a, but do not quote me on this) so that I could try it for the first time.  Man, oh, man! I could not believe how good fried sushi was! I had always opted for raw prior to this night; however, there was not an ounce of disappointment in any way. Did I mention that they were VERY generous with the dipping sauce? Our satisfactions were at a complete 10/10.  I believe that we had a roll of the Golden Gate and a roll of the Spicy Ninja - in case anyone curiosity strikes in anyone.  Fried sushi, in my opinion, is perfect for winter nights, as it is a very warming dish.",

So we arrived 10 minutes early and waited 20 minutes after our reservation to be seated. When we made the reservation we stated that it was for a birthday party, obviously it didn't matter. Our chef was interrupted during cooking our food to prepare a to go order for Floyd Mayweather and his people. So rude!! How is his money better than our group? How do you have any idea that we wouldn't tip just as well let alone come back and/or recommend this place to other people?! This was utterly absurd since there were other tables/grills and chefs available who could have done this. The food was good but since this was definitely not the experience we expected. Also, they sang happy birthday to 2 other parties while we were there and brought dessert of which our group did not receive. I had been to this place as a visitor to Las Vegas and as a resident, I can't say I will be in a hurry to come back, which sucks because the food is really good. But who wants such lackadaisical service?! Not I!!",

    "text": "We participated in a Teppanyaki dinner experience with 8 family and friends to celebrate 2 birthdays. First I recommend making reservations and to request Chef/Owner Tsutomu aka Tiger. The chef  is well experienced and will entertain you with his artistic and culinary skills.   The location of restaurant is not well marked if you are traveling north on Paradise. It is in a strip mall and the front of the building does not face Paradise. Watch for the cross street Corporate Drive. A tip -  it is across the street from Del Frisco's.  The restaurant has a colorful Asian flare. The Teppanyaki dining area is separate from the room with regular dining tables. The service staff is very attentive and continues to watch over the table. Teppanyaki dining at Musashi with Chef Tsutomu is like going to the theater. Be prepared to be wowed for 2 hours. Dinner begins with a small garden salad followed by Miso Soup. The soup was very tasty and flavored with mushrooms and scallions. While you you are enjoying salad and soup the chef is busy preparing the sauces which a too many to remember. But he will provide suggestions for the food paring. The appetizers ordered were edamame and shrimp tempura. The Shishito Peppers which are seasonal were not available this night.  Our group ordered a variety of entrees that included New York strip streak, shrimp, scallops, and chicken. But before the entrees the chef prepared the vegetables and fried rice. All of the items were cooked to perfection as ordered. It's a credit to the chefs experience to keep track how each person ordered the degree of doneness and level of seasoning.  In my opinion the best were the scallops. They were as tender and fresh as can be expected. A great beer paring is a large bottle of Sapporo. The finale was the complementary birthday cakes complete with candle. Kudos to Chef Tsutomu for a fantastic dining experience.",

Just go you won't be disappointed and try every chef out. It's more fun that way. I really don't want to pick a favorite chef like most people do because I feel its unnecessary to judge like that. I like that every chef has given us something unique from different sauces to different tricks. But at the end of the day the food is always and I mean always awesome!! Oh the sauces that these guys make are all different. I loved chef youngs sauce though he took the fat from the New York steak and cooked it up for a while and made a sauce for our steak that was really delish!! Forever customer for sure",

Probably not a bad place to go if you want to drink a bunch and don't care about flavor. Not a good place if you want some authentic Japanese food.",

    "text": "My husband and I dropped in for dinner and were a little bummed when we were told that because we didn't have a reservation the next opening at a grill table wouldn't be until 9:30, this was at 6:45. Debating on sitting in the dinning room and ordering off their \"other menu\" or going somewhere else, two couples came in for their reservation and informed the hostess that a couple from their party cancelled. Lucky us! We were seated at 7 and the waitress quickly took drink orders and was back in a flash to take our meal selection. Lady Luck really was dealing us a great hand because our chef just happened to be the owner! First of all, whether this was scripted or not, man, Tiger was funny. He had the whole entire table in stitches! While doing amazing knife, spatula, and meat fork flipping, setting the grill ablaze while flipping bowls of rice, entertaining us with witty banter and stories, he custom made about a dozen dipping sauces. Seriously, we barely had room for our plates and drinks because there were 6 dipping sauce pairs squeezed between me and the hubby! After making each set of sauces he would tell us which items paired the best. When he was done cooking for all of us, having also made extra side dishes for us to try (no extra charge) he started chatting with me and my husband. We have friends in the restaurant business in California and we talked about the hard life and passion restauranteurs need to have. He was really such a cool and down to earth guy. After he finished and cleaned up and moved for the next chef to start the table on the opposite side he came back out to finish our conversation. We really felt this one meal made our quick trip amazing. We love supporting small businesses and we really felt that this owner loved what he was doing and wanted to make dinning with him a full experience. He had mention owning a Korean bbq place so next time we are in town we will have to try that. I suggest this place if you are looking for dinner and a show. It was certainly entertaining and delicious, well worth the $ and great quality of food!",

It was pretty different than the typical Benihana course- Musashi provides SO many sauces. You can also choose many different sauces for your meat selection- for example you can get chicken with a sweet sauce, a garlic butter sauce, and more!

The wait was nearly an hour at 1AM which was chill because this joint is popular hence all all the cool celeb photos plastered all over the walls in the lobby.   I honestly think our under stimulated grill master was ready to go home when are group of 10 sat down at 2am.   Our FRIED RICE was  totally burned and sauces offered were salty and served sloppy as heck!  The grill master cooking for us was off his game this night and even forgot some of our proteins ordered. By the end of the meal I was too sleepy to care about all the seafood I wasted due to the overload of sodium. I'm grateful the check arrived quick with no complications considering our party size (definitely not always an easy task).   I'll give this teppan grill another whirl on a not so late night in the future.",

It's in your typical run of the mill small strip mall in Vegas and you'd have no idea what was in store until you sat down and experienced the food and show. There is an adult themed version as well as a more kid friendly version but if you can take the jokes and appreciate the humor I highly recommend the adult show. It is a must stop every time we are in Vegas and have brought in friends and family to experience the show and amazing food. Tiger is the best.

From start to finish, the salad dressing tastes fresh, tangy, sweet. They move onto a soup, and this is one of the best soups I've had at hibachi, it comes out nice and HOT, just the way it should be served.  Moving on to the chefs cooking, they are talented, and Tiger is quite comedic. I brought the family in for my birthday dinner, and they loved it.   I love how they make all the sauces for you right infront of your eyes, if you want spicy they make it, sweet, savory you name it and they will make it happen. They ALWAYS ask how do you want your food prepared, I eat my chicken plain, and prefer to dip it in sauce (rather than smother) some places aren't this considerate.   To finish off, fried bananas are yum.   !! They even have a great Late Night Special, where it is super cheap !!",

    "text": "It's been a long time since I've had teppanyaki so I can't compare Musashi to that famous teppanyaki chain. Overall it was a fun experience with good food. We made a reservation for 5 people and they told us they would only hold the reservation for 10 min. We actually ended up being the only party at our table which was kind of lonely after seeing all the other tables full.   They have a pretty good bar selection with shochu and bottled beers. Our waitress came and got our orders for appetizers and served soup and salad before the chef came out. The meals here are pretty spendy but you do get a lot of vegetables, sides, and sauces. I opted for the Samurai Special #2 with NY Steak and scallops with added fried rice. We also got a small portion of prawns, bean sprouts, and grilled vegetables. It's a LOT of food. Is it a lot of meat? No not really, especially the scallops. Everyone in our party ordered their meat medium rare but it ended up being more like medium well. I think chopping up the meat in small pieces allows the meat to get overcooked quickly. I don't quite understand the need for all the sauces when a lot of them are similar. I liked to use the sauce on my fried rice but generally I thought the meat and veggies were fine without it. It's True the decor is a little dilapidated and the bathrooms were especially frightening (I think I spotted blood on the door and sink handle) but I'm sure that was just an isolated incident.   Overall it's a fun time and the food is good. I think I'd probably only go back for the happy hour because all of that food for half off sounds like the deal of the century. I like that it's more laid back than what you'd expect at teppanyaki. I recommend but I think going late at night after a few drinks is probably the best way to go.",

When I first went, I got lucky enough to get Tiger, and it was the best teppanyaki experience I've ever had.  And I've been to  A LOT of teppanyaki places.  My friends wanted to get something quick, and I had to convince them to go there.  Afterwards, everyone was extremely pleased. When I went there a second time, I got another chef, and the experience was average at best.   I was surprised that there was such a large disparity in terms of the experience because every other teppanyaki place I've been to has had consistency amongst the chefs. In other words, you can go multiple times and get different chefs, yet the food and overall experience will be extremely similar.  When we were seated on my second visit, Tiger was cooking at another table.  It seemed as if he had been going for a while.  When our chef was done, Tiger was still cooking.  He takes his time and the product reflects this. He also spends a long time making fantastic sauces.  My chef only used the generic sauces from the bottle. Not to say that he was bad - the food was still good.  But I was surprised that the overall product would be so different between the chefs.  So definitely request Tiger. And hopefully he'll start training the other chefs to make a product similar to the outstanding quality of his",

The food is amazing, my hubby loves the sushi, but the BEST part of this place is the sauces they make.  This last time we went they had 5-6 sauces ranging from mild to flavor-filled spicy.  Every sauce was amazing and they cook them right on the grill in front of you.  This last time we found out they're open till early in the morning which is great when we come in late to Vegas and are hungry.  We HIGHLY recommend this place!!!! BEWARE...TON OF FOOD!!! LOVE IT!!!

He was raving about the food quality, the freshness of the ingredients and how it was a whole caliber above other teppanyaki chains.  Walking in we saw the swanky and posh interior, and I felt we could look forward to an awesome meal.  Unfortunately, me and my g/f this was as good as it was going to get, and left here very disappointed, which was unfortunate considering my family friend really hyped us up and considering we saw all the positive yelp reviews.  I will say we did go do go during lunch and maybe as a result you don't get the full experience that the dinner crowd gets, but I with all honesty I am basing most rating on the quality of the food we received.  We walked in and got seated fairly quickly, as there was a group of other walk-ins sitting and waiting.  I talked to the others sitting there, and found out one couple was sitting there for about 10 minutes and the other group of three people had been there for almost 30 minutes and still hadn't taken their order.  So needless to say, the other groups seemed slightly irritated because of the wait, but I guess I can see how it isn't exactly cost effective to do teppanyaki cooking for just two or three people.  But still sitting that long can be a little irritating.  The soup was a little on the salty side for my tastes, the soy sauce kinda covered up the overall flavors of the dish.  The lunch combination also came with some fried rice which was hot, and did have some crispy rice pieces, which was a nice thing, but I felt that the flavoring was a bit on the bland side.  The sauces that my friend told us about weren't being made in front of us, they were coming out of a squeeze bottle, one being miso based and the other tasted a little soy-citrus base... both were good, but didn't find it much different from the same sauces you get at Benihana.  The chef we got that day didn't seem that into it, he was there and cooking it, but didn't say very much or do much interacting with the guests at the table.  The only reason I bring this up, is that teppanyaki is supposed to be a show, part of the reason you usually pay for this is to be entertained while you eat.  The chef continued on and started to make or meals, I had tried some of the vegetable stir fry that my g/f ordered, probably the best thing I had during this meal, the veggies were well cooked, not over done and rubbery, nice light char on it and pretty well seasoned.  If I knew what was to follow I would have stopped eating here.  Next came the Steak and Prawns - While I went and asked for medium rare, he served it well down, the steak was a brick and the prawns were overcooked and rubbery.  My g/f and I shared a side a scallops which were once again, over cooked.  No moisture left in the disk shape brick we were given, it was inedible, we didn't bother finishing the dish.  I was really disappointed in the meal, I really had high expectations for place based on the reviews and recommendation that I got.  I really wanted to like this place because I wanted to come back and do a late night food run and try their Okonomiyaki.  But after have such a bad lunch experience I don't think any amount of booze and drunk munchies could get me to come back on this trip.  Ill give them a try down the road for dinner, maybe it will be better experience...  But in the mean time I gotta go call my friend and give him a hard time about that recommendation.",

    "text": "I am a Las Vegas local and have eaten here at least 20 times. We ( My husband and I , sometimes with friends ) usually come here after midnight. That is our \"normal\" dinner time and just so happens to be the time of their happy hour. ( we eat teppanyaki, he occasionally gets sushi but it isn't anything super great maybe 3.5 stars for sushi )  You can get full entree stuff for lunch prices in addition to sushi and drink specials. We have experienced shitty service from the wait staff before and other times its beyond excellent. We don't come here for the wait staff though.   FOOD::::  The food is a bit above average but what really makes this place is the amazing side sauces. ( request garlic butter, yum yum, & spicy yum yum for starters ) The chefs are mostly all good besides this white guy we had one time but haven't seen him again. As a frequent customer I do notice preferential treatment and nicer staff. I wouldn't say customers as new combers get poor treatment by any means... just normal.. but as frequent customers we get a little special attention. I would highly recommend coming here..  HOURS, STAFF, & POKER:::   In June and July when the world series of poker is happening this place often stays open till 4 or 5 am... but that doesn't happen all the time.. tonight were here and they barely let the last couple in at 2:55. It isn't unusual for them to close early if they are slow. Just call first if you are concerned. Also, if you are unhappy I highly recommend you request Tiger ( the owner, but not on football days/nights :) ) and say \"Hey, last time it wasn't that great, can you make it up for me?\" and he will be sure to get you back on track. The other chefs are great too but like I said if you didn't like it last time you should ask for the owner. We didn't like some guys at first but learned to request certain things certain ways if needed that really amped up our experience. Don't be afraid to ask for something special in a special way.   ATMOSPHERE:::  Some of the chef's can be very over the top with x-rated type stuff.. but we almost always sit with locals or people who frequent the place so I'm not sure if that is filtered out at other times.. the chef's appear to work off the mood.   PRICE::   Happy Hour Teppan - $ 17 steak and shrimp includes fried rice Non happy hour teppan - $29 steak and shrimp plus $3.50 for fried rice",

You should pop in here after 12 am, because they have these awesome deals where a NY steak could work out to be around (give or take)17 bucks. A must-try partner in crime would be the garlic sauce. I say the sauce is a criminal because it is super oily....but super good. However, if I was eating teppanyaki at midnight, I probably wasn't worrying about my thighs anyways. In addition to your main course, you get this deliciously peppery mushroom soup, fried rice, and a side of sauteed veggies. Everything is delicious and the cooks with keep you entertained!",

The waiter told me he couldn't make my own tab at first but reluctantly changed his mind. I get it, no one likes having to deal with separate checks, but I only had my credit card and I didn't know the rest of the people in the party. Anyway I placed my order (chicken teriyaki bowl) and shortly after the waiter told our group that we needed to change tables because Floyd Mayweather's entourage needed our table. WTF. Mind you this was a planned birthday dinner and everyone was in the middle of eating! I couldn't believe what was happening! So we all follow their wishes and bring our plates and food over to our new tables without complaining but they didn't even offer anything for having to move in the middle of our dinner! My friend had to mention something to them and I think they finally gave 20% off to the birthday boy but nothing else. So embarassing! My food never came to the new table until I asked a different waiter where it was and by then everyone was already done eating. I understand sometimes venues have to cater to high profile clientele but it should have been handled differently.",

I can only say that the place was AWESOME!! We had the owner as our cook and he treated us to 6 or 7 different sauces. We had the Musashi special, and it was the bomb!! Tiger (the owner) was not only a great chef, but was a great entertainer. If you want Tepenyaki that is only 1 mile from the strip and easy on the wallet, you'll want to try Musashi. As a local, I rank this place as high as I would Morton's, or Ruth Chris!! The sushi is OK, but the Musashi Special is out of this world!! Nuff-said!!",

    "text": "My Musashi experience was quite by accident, but definitely a pleasant surprise.    6:00 pm rolled around and my fiance and I got ready to meet his friends for a birthday dinner at Marrakech, the Moroccan restaurant beside Musashi.  They got hung up at Bodies the Exhibit and finally around 8:30, we met up outside Marrakech.  It was closed.  For super bowl Sunday.  What?  Anyway, we were all starving and next door was Musashi.  Inviting, but above all open, we decided to give it a try.  The restaurant was empty aside from one gentleman at the bar, and the four of us were seated at a comfy round booth.  All of us decided on sushi.  My guy and I had the ugly redhead, da bomb, j in my mouth, and something else that I don't remember.  I also got a seaweed salad.  Birthday boy had two mai tais and said they were very good.  He and his fiance also had the sexy redhead roll, and some others.      Our server, Alex, was funny, fun, and did a great job of staggering our rolls with the chefs so that we had an endless flow of sushi for a good hour and a half.  When we ordered j in my mouth, he told us his name was Jay, and I'm totally gullible...so when I called for Jay we all got a good laugh when he told us his real name.  With our sushi, he also brought us some of their special house sauces they've come up with.  Most of their sauces are for the teppan bar,  he said, but they are expanding into sushi condiments.  Oh yeah, and the sushi was GREAT!  My favorite by far was Da Bomb....with a nice thick slice of fresh jalepeno and lots of spicy tuna in every piece, you can't go wrong.  Everything looked very fresh, was beautifully presented, and tasted great.  Their prices are great for all the specialty rolls they offer, and I can't wait to go back again to try their hot entrees out.  Course, I'll probably end up gorging myself on sushi again....",

    "text": "Welcome to the finest Japanese restaurant in Las Vegas, possibly the entire country. We have visited this place several times over the past couple years. We are Vegas regulars and go out of our way to visit every time we are in town.   There are two things that are absolutely outstanding at this restaurant and will blow your mind. First is the service, second is the food.   The reason we started visiting here was a result of the owner/chef Tsutomu and his previous job. Prior to opening his own restaurant, he worked at the teppan grill in Hamada in the Flamingo. His personality, friendliness and cooking abilities were so impressive that we had to follow him to his new business. After just one visit, he remembered our names.   The Chef constantly engages his customers, determines their level of comfort and works to reach it. There's really not words to describe how nice and accommodating he is to all his customers. It's obvious they get a lot of regulars as a result of this. It's also nice to see that the owner isn't just sitting the back doing nothing, he cooks on the grill more than anyone else and his wife works the hostess stand sometimes. One time, on our way out, she noticed we were calling a cab, and called it for us, telling them to step on it. All his staff are very polite and well trained. This is one of those rare places, outside my own home, where I always feel truly comfortable and welcome. When they aren't too busy in there, and cooking has finished, the owner will stay to chat for a while at the grill. If you want a remarkable experience for service, come here. I suggest you specifically request (even if you have to wait) for the owner to cook for you, instead of another staff member. It's worth the wait.   Combine that kind of service, with the food, and you get a winning combination. All the food is excellent, beyond excellent. We cook a lot at home, and know good seasonings, versus salting everything. This guy truly has a talent. Everything from the salads, sushi and grill are recognizable dishes (especially if you've ever been to Benihana's) but with unique twists that give it really special flavors and bring out the ingredients' natural qualities. Even the salad, instead of the typical asian dressing, comes out with (what I think is) an apple flavored dressing. Every sauce in the entire restaurant is hand crafted from his original recipes. The salad and soup are great, but wait until you taste something off that grill. Just when you think he couldn't possibly do any more with the sauces, he adds about 10 more things and it smells even better. We've had the pleasure of him 'testing' his newer sauces on us a few times. Let me be very clear: best ever. We are talking about a culinary genius here. The owner has an honest passion for what he does. I've had steak, shrimp, scallops and even simple teriyaki chicken here, and each was better than the one before. The fried rice is a special treat too. I typically prefer white rice, but always look forward to the fried rice here.   They have several sake and beer selections here. They get a lot of locals in there after midnight, and they are typically open after 2 or 3am. They enjoy a rowdy crowd in there, but we also took our grandmother and her friends in. The decor is quite nice, not over the top, but not cheesy, like most of these establishments. A cab ride, with tip, from a strip hotel will run you less than $20.   I cannot recommend this place enough. It's a masterpiece in every way. The prices are moderate. I usually end up spending less than I thought I would, even though they seem high when I look at them. What more can you say about a restaurant with excellent service and the best food this side of the Pacific? Please give this place a try, it will blow you away.",

We were fortunate to have the owner as our chef.   He gave us the standard 2 sauces a la most teppan places... then proceeded to make 3 different special sauces on the table.  We told him we liked it spicy and he brought out a special sauce from the back that he had made earlier that day. To die for.  His knifework is also no joke. He is a True showman and takes pride in his presentation, unlike so many other teppan chefs who are just trying to get through their shift.   I highly recommend you order the Musashi Special, which is filet mignon, prawns, scallops, and a whole lobster tail, along with the usual other stuff.  A good starter appetizer (if you like spicy stuf) is the Firecracker - jalapenos stuffed with spicy tuna and cream cheese.  Prices are in line with other teppan joints.   I will visit Musashi every time I am in Vegas from now on, and you should too.",

The green mussels were odd, the spicy tuna rolls were almost non-existent due to their tiny size and lack of flavor. There were a couple of rolls that were pretty good but I honestly think they only seemed good because we were desperate for something to be good!    The service was poor, including the hostess up front. They were basically unorganized.   And finally, the lighting in the dining area was horrible. It felt like we had a spot light on us throughout our dinner. If you accidentally looked up into the light, you'd be blinded for a minute. DIM THE LIGHTS! Please. It's a simple thing to do.   I'm thankful to live in LA where we have an abundance of delicious sushi.   Thank you for your time.",

But still had it in my memory to come here on my next trip to Vegas. I'm so glad I remembered to come here, Musashi did not disappoint. I've been to a few tepenyaki place before, this one had to top my list of best tepenyaki style restaurants.   I called to make reservations, just about 30 mins ahead of time with no problem. This was on a Thursday night, so I'm sure on weekends, you probably want to make a bit more of an advance reservation. Once we got there, we were seated immediately and waited a few mins for other reservations to fill our community table. Me and my friends ordered a few appetizers and sushi before our meals. Yaka-tori skewers...tiny portion but delicious!   We ordered our main entrees, and a few minutes after the Tepenyaki chef came out with a tray full of fresh meats and sauces. The tepen chef spoke broken English, and sometimes was a bit hard to understand but enough for him to make it an enjoyable dinner. He was funny and friendly. He even had the \"barrel-man\" to make us laugh...and for you ol' school Filipinos out there, you know the \"barrel-man\". lol!   I had the chicken and prawns with fried rice, my other friends had the new york steak, and salmon and prawns. All of it awesome! Put it like this, by the end of the dinner all of us sitting at the table had empty plates and full stomaches! The infusion of sauces were incredible. The cooking and entertainment were all bonuses. if you've never eaten at a tepenyaki style restaurant, I highly suggest you give it a try, especially if your in Vegas next time. Try Musashi Like they said on the travel channel, top tepenyaki style restaurant in the nation. I would have to agree!",

Musashi lacks the stiff atmosphere of Benihana and replaces it with a relaxed, fun environment. If you're a night owl the place stays open in to the early morning.   One of the things that sets this place apart is that these guys roll out a great selection of sauces made right in front of you. Last time we were there we had about 7 of them to dip from.   Highly recommended.",

    "text": "Mushashi is your typical teppanyaki style Japanese restaurant. When you first walk in, underwhelmed is probably the word that comes to mind. The paint is chipping/dirty, the furnishings have seen their better days, and any decorations that they did have were modest at best. They do have some really cool kimonos on the walls though. Probably to cover a hole in the wall or gang graffiti or something.  The bathroom is a complete disaster. The door didn't lock and the upkeep was... Basically there is no upkeep. I've seen frat houses have cleaner bathrooms. It was pretty gross.  So after all that, I STILL gave this place four stars. Why? The food is that good and the price they charge at happy hour is ridiculously cheap. The food is comparable, if not better, than the much more expensive teppenyaki locations. Literally the cost is about 1/3 or 1/4 what you would spend at Benihanas. The chefs are all very friendly and they put on a fun/funny show, but thats nothing new to this type of setting.   I do not recommend the sushi here. Stick with the teppenyaki. The uni that I ordered looked and tasted like it was scraped off the bathroom floor.   Overall, great food and great price. I actually made myself hungry thinking about this place and will most likely go tonight!",

We ordered 3 rolls of sushi, it took an hour and 15 minutes to get to us, I could make sushi faster than that!   Unfortunately the food was great! but the service was so bad that when the check came I gave them exact change, absolutely no tip at all, these people showed us very clearly that they did not care at all about customer service.   After 45 minutes I was about to leave the restaurant out of frustration but my friend kept me calm or at least until I walked out.   They really mad us man and it was just such a disappointment because the food was good, the service was just utterly terrible.",

    "text": "I'm going to preface this review by saying that if it wasn't for the smell that permeated the restaurant, this place would have 4 stars, because the food is really good.  It is a typical teppanyaki style Japanese restaurant, with the sushi bar/sit down area in one room, and the teppanyakis on the other side.  The chefs are good at what they do, and it's nice that they make several of the sauces for your meat and veggies right there as you watch.  Some things don't change from place to place, you get the corny jokes, the lighting things on fire, etc.  Here however, you better be ready for some rated R things as well.  So if you get offended by anything having to do with the male anatomy, tell your chef before hand so they won't make those jokes. The time I ate there with my mother I wasn't sure if she was gonna laugh or yell at the guy, but thankfully my mom's sense of humor prevailed.  On the whole, I would go back there for the food, but I kind of wish they would update the interior and do something about the smell, I know it's keeping first time customers away.",

    "text": "I went here last week for my girlfriends birthday party, there was about 5 of us girls and we were all having a good time until we got to this restaurant, right when the chef started you could instantly tell he was drunk, very unprofessional! I've been to Benihana and restaurants like this before and the chefs are always very social and into what there doing, we expected something similar especially since it was our friends birthday not only did he not say one single word to us but he dint nothing special while cooking our food dint do any tricks while cooking he did NOTHING AT ALL we might as well say at a booth, he literally looked like he hated his job, then to top everything off the food was horrible my friend asked for her steak to be cooked well done and he threw it on her plate and it was pink, when she said something he just gave her a very rude look, it was such a bad experience that it killed our whole night and we just wanted to go home, everyone's meal came with ice cream and when we complained to the manager about how horrible our service was, they told us they would give us ice cream ? Even after we told them our meal already comes with ice cream, and even if it dint like really is ice cream suppose to make up for our horrible time and our horrible food, I could see if the food was good but it wasn't. None of us ate our food, and we're not a bunch of stuck up girls. the food was just not good at all and nothing was cooked how we asked, so when we all said we dint want to pay for the meat since he would not cook it how we wanted it but we would pay for our drinks and everything else the chef walked over to my friend went into his wallet throw out 2 hundred dollar bills and said I'll pay for these fucking BITCHES! That's when we lost it I could not believe he spoke to us like that and to call us bitches was just so disrespectful and unprofessional and his boss did nothing about it! I felt so bad for my friend who's birthday it was we were very calm and came at them very respectful and for them to treat us like that was so uncalled for, I would never come here or recommend this place to anyone it was mind blowing that they were in the wrong and did nothing to fix it, a couple of my friends called to speak to the owner and every time they hang up on them or leave them on hold.. horrible customer service,",

(not gonna spoil it for you) but whoo that thing gets HOT (temperature and quality) haha.  Anyways, I got the chicken and the shrimp, but you can pick whatever you want such as steak, lobster, etc.  Its just gets a little pricey. obvi.  That comes with fried rice and grilled veggies.  The rice is so amazing.  Probably one of the best fried rice ever especially with that man sauce drizzled all over it (ask for it!) It's a secret, thank me later! I wonder if I could take a bottle of it to go and bring it back to california. Muhaha.  The shrimp and the chicken are really good too! Overall, the food is garlic-y and super savory. MMM.  I chefs are very generous too, gave us extra rice and meat! The portions are big enough though!  i only deducted a star because the time I went which was around 2am (after the club) haha, the wait was so long! Not because there was so many people, the service.  I don't know if that is a regular thing or because it was late night? I was quite disappointed and very impatient.  However, the man sauce made up for the rest of the review.   Get the crunch roll for a little appetizer, made the wait somewhat bearable.",

I wanted someplace reasonably priced with convenient seating for the nine people in my party who could do saki bombs without being looked at like we are weird and oh yeah, good food.  Check, check, check and check!!  First let me tell you about the food.  No other teppan style restaurant compares.  Musashi is so delicious.  A lot of times, teppan for me is tasteless because all it is is just unseasened food being grilled, not much flavor or style, but evertying Tiger made for us was mouthwatering.  And if you are a sauce person, he makes about a half dozen for you to try and advises you which sauce to eat with what type of food.  And the portions are so generous that two people can definately share one plate so go ahead and order the lobster and rib eye (even though we ordered that AND the sea bass and chicken...both so yum).  Do get the fried rice as it is really delicious.  And now for the entertainment.  All nine of us agreed that we had the best time.  All nine of us agreed that we are coming back next time we are back in Vegas.  All nine of us were in stiched laughing we had such a good time.  Don't hesitate on holding your event here!  And request Tiger to perpare your food.  He has some skilz fo sho!!!",

My experience was very amusing and fun. When you first walk in the smell can kind of be a turn off. It sort of smelled like fish ,not the normal fishy smell you get from most Japanese restaurants ,but more like the type of fish that has been left out for a while.   The service from the wait staff was good they seem attentive and they kept our drinks filled. The thing that won me over was our teppanyaki chef! His name was Nick and first he was very entertaining with his little show he does with the utensils ,but his personality was something to behold! He was full of jokes and kept the whole table laughing. I believe the next time I go there I will make a reservation and request him as a chef and I think you should too if your thinking about going there. One thing though it is kind of pricey ,but the quality and show make it worth it. So best advice if you want a splurge on a nice restaurant I would say definitely come here. :)",

The food here is easily the best I've ever had at a Japanese Steakhouse.  Typically I'd say that food at these types of establishments is pretty good, but you're going for the \"show\" as much as the food.  Our chef was low on the silly 'catch an egg in my hat' fluffy show stuff, but the food was phenomenal.  He mostly talked to us about their foods, and he clearly is passionate about his craft.  As others mentioned, they prepare custom sauces that are not part of a normal Japanese Steakhouse.  And they are GREAT.    Yes, the restaurant atmosphere is pretty 'blah', but I don't go to restaurants to admire wallpaper.  I go to eat.",

The chef Tiger is the best one, and also his cousion is very good too. The chefs put on a show as you eat and it is entertaining.  The only thing that could be better is -it is a little pricey, and sometimes you get a newer chef that isnt as good as Tiger. It usually takes 30min to an hour to eat here, they pace the meal and cook each thing by itself usually. It is very filling, I recommend the Geisha special which I usually order. And try to get Tiger as your chef, he makes the whole experience better. He also cares a lot about his customers and it shows. -Jerry",

    "text": "I really have no clue where to start. Maybe I should begin with saying that there were no door knobs on the door. Yup.   After figuring out how to get inside, we were immediately greeted by a foul smell that was similar to sweaty socks. Not something you want too smell at a restaurant. Normally we would have left, but we had 9pm reservations and everyone seemed to be raving about the food.  We were seated at a teppanyaki style table alone. After a few minutes another party of 2 joined, followed by an additional party of 5. All guys.  We got our drinks, gave in our order and waited. and waited. and waited. Finally at about 9:35 our salads arrived. Now, I'm from NYC and every hibachi place I've been too, we've never been longer then an hour. Here, we were already 35 minutes in with just our salads and no chef in sight. The salad was bland and wasn't very appetizing. The soup arrived a few minutes later which was actually really good. Definitely one of the only good things about this meal.  Finally at 9:50, just as we were about to complain, our chef arrived. He noticed I was the only girl at the table and proceeded to make a heart out of oil and say \"Thats for you!\". I thought it was a kind gesture until I turned around and heard him say \"This is also for you!\" To my surprise, he was holding a wooden penis. Yes you just read that right. A wooden penis. Wtf. I think I died a little inside, but laughed it off. Was totally turned off by this and I kinda just sat there in shock for a few minutes.  Let me just be the one to say this - I hate when teppanyaki places serve your rice first. By the time any of the other food gets to you, theres no more rice. This was probably the least annoying thing of the entire experience. EXCEPT - for when the penis flashing chef insisted we all try his \"cream\". Please don't take that out of context. One minute I'm eating my rice, the next minute he's forcing some yellowish sauce type cream on the other half of my rice. I took one bite of it and hated it.  It was terrible. Why would this guy ruin my rice like that?!   The food was just completely mediocre and absolutely nothing to write home about. I'll probably never come back, or even ever consider it. I think if I was dying of hunger right outside of this place I'd still consider the gum stuck on the sidewalk then go in and have a meal here.",

    "text": "OK... most of my friends will BURN me for the 3-Star rating.   here's my take:  -----TIME SPENT 2x times @ night  -----LAYOUT small, couple tables, 2 hibachi grills...  seen one hibachi, seen them all.   i DARE anyone tell me that this place has a unique look.  -----SERVICE prompt seating...   attentive and cheerful waitress.   the ONLY good performer is the owner himself.   another reason why this place is only 3-Star.   his other cook is Mexican (sorry) and is a boring and standard in hibachi performance...   to be fair, i've never had him, but i glance over now n then to see his quiet performance.   sorry again.^^  my friends will kill me on this too, but the owner himself isn't too impressive.   he has a couple of good jokes, but i've seen ALL of his tricks used by other hibachi chefs....   i'm sorry to be so scathing.   i really hate seeing the same things over and over again.   it's like watching another zombie flick.  the ONLY trick that was new to me was that he made rabbits out of shrimp.   i thought it was delightful at which point.   however, he does the volcano, he finds someone to pick on and throws shrimp at, he spins the egg and lands it on his spatula....  i know it's HARD to do, but common fair.     there was a hibachi chef in texas a few years back (<a href=\"/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.samuraioftokyo.com&s=551fd985fdbfe84a1fe0b03762f62ceee0751d0f1c17f577510a11573289888e\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">samuraioftokyo.com</a>) that also owned his own place.   i recalled how masterfully he would incorporate words with whatever he was doing.   like, he would use his spatula to cut eggs, but he would then scratch it back and forth like a DJ and say funny things....  and that was what Musashi's owner was missing.   creativity.  i even remember hearing my friend apologizing to me about the chef's performance.   he told me that the man probably wasn't being his usual funny self because my friend was a regular there and the chef didn't want to deliver his usual routine....   but so what.   being the owner and a hibachi chef should mean something...  it's like being the headlining comedian but not feeling like delivering your trademark punchlines.  the food was excellant at least and the chef made some good sauces on the side.   to be honest tho, i've never had anyone mess up fried rice and rare steak at a hibachi - and his sauces ARE NOT hard to make...   sh*t, i cook the same fried rice & steak at home and i'm just an AVERAGE cook...   good meal nonetheless.^^;  -----PRICING pricey - but pretty much the average fair as hibachi meals go.  $24-$30 a plate and $40+ for pricier combos.  -----CLOSING if you're going to open up a hibachi place, i can understand the need to entertain with basic routines... but you're in Vegas and you're the damn owner for god sakes.!  be creative - make your routines lead into unique results...   i really wanted to come and enjoy a show because i genuiningly love hibachis...  so i kind of felt robbed of a unqiue experience....  BTW, i've read the other reviews after writing my own...  and the words \"TYPICAL\" and \"AVERAGE\" pops out a lot.   why give this place 4-Stars when you used any of those words in your review.??  3-Stars for being JUST another Hibachi to me.",

    "text": "After seeing Musashi on the Travel Channel and reading the reviews of fellow Yelpers, we decided to give this place a try on our last trip to Vegas.  We didn't have to wait very long to be seated, although the wait for our Teppan chef was a little bit long - we didn't mind it though. The only reason I did not give this place a 5-star review is because the actual servers can be aloof and they are not the friendliest when you walk in.  I ordered the Musashi Special, which comes with: filet mignon, prawns, scallops, and a lobster tail. Each of the specials also comes with a salad, soup (delish mix of onions, mushrooms and beef), fried rice, veggies, and a shrimp appetizer.   Our Teppan chef, Nick, was awesome! He really made our 2.5-hour experience completely fun and enjoyable. Yes, they can be pretty raunchy   during the show as described by other Yelpers, but that will only happen if they get that vibe from your table (our table was open to it, so he went there).  All of the food was great - well prepared and flavorful. The sauces they prepare are no joke. They are great! Nick made us their usual sauces and also additional sauces that he thought that we would enjoy.  Spot-on!  The meal ended with ice cream (not all meals include it). The green tea ice cream is really good.  All in all, this is a really fun place with great food. I will definitely be back.",

    "text": "OK. So here is a little history about the place. Musashi was awarded best Japanese restaurant in 2007 by city search and is Open Table's 2009 winner for Best Kid-Friendly Restaurant awards. But better for adults  then kids i think. We found out about the place while watching the food network channel. food network channel say whaaat!?? That's right.  So with that being said and it being my first time attending the place I'd have to say is by far one of the best teppanyaki places i have been to. Compared to the famous benihana's this place is say is 100x times better. Our chef was not only skilled at cooking but was really funny and entertaining as well. The Fillet minion was very delicious. The Steaks are fresh and tender. Great variety of dipping sauces. Best sauces i ever tasted in any Japanese restaurant. The steaks are served by itself or as a surf and turf with lobster or shrimp. I recommend you bringing someone here for a birthday. Only because your birthday guests will get a lovely birthday surprise with their meal.   The Place opens till 4am. Its one of those places that is closed for a couple hours between lunch and dinner between 3pm-5pm I believe. So anytime before or after you will be able to get in. Reservations aren't necessary. A very popular spot w/ celebrities. Again highly recommended. A great place for entertainment. Enjoy!",

The food is great, the fish extremely fresh (like, flown in that morning fresh), and they have a fantastic assortment of cut rolls, some very inventive. Prices are reasonable and you get a lot for your money, but as with any sushi place, you can run the bill up pretty quick if you don't watch yourself.  On the down side, the service is always only adequate - servers are OK, but always just a little hipper than you are, if you get my drift. And there is a slight, ever-present scent in the dining room... it might be natural gas, if it wasn't a little too greasy-smelling.   But overall, a great place, and since it's off the strip, it's never jammed full of loonies or too busy to seat you. I've never come away less than full and satisfied.",

    "text": "I love steak.  I really really love steak.  Up until this point the only restaurants I've reviewed have been steakhouses, I think.  So let me preface my review with this:  I generally don't think of teppan as steak, because something about the meat being cubed and then cooked makes it lose a lot of that wonderful rare flavor that I love.  That said... I've had the best steaks of my life at musashi.  You know it's going to be a wonderful evening when you walk into musashi and see the Kobe beef certificate on display on the front podium -- it means that the Kobe is in and available that day.   And by Kobe I don't mean that American, or New Zealand or Australian wagyu that a lot of restaurants try to pass off as \"Kobe\".  This is real. Certified. Kobe.  It's so different, delectable, wonderful, like bubbles of delicious flavor bursting in your mouth....and really, I feel like if you like steak, you shouldn't go through life without trying this place out at least once. (at least when Kobe is available)  As far as ambiance goes, it's a beautiful restaurant inside, decorated in a contemporary way with red and black incorporating traditional kimono and uchikake on the walls, it's a place that makes you feel really good to sit down in, yet not overly formal.   We've been here two times, and the second time we were able to get the owner as our chef, and I have to say -- it was a totally different and awesome experience.  He is by far the best and most entertaining teppan chef I have ever encountered -- couple that with the fact that he cooks custom sauces for your meat on the grill that are gourmet miracles, I highly suggest that you request him as your chef if you ever decide to go.  End note:  The pricing here is really reasonable (I'd say 20-40 a person?), but if you're planning on getting the Kobe, be prepared to spend upwards of 100-150 per person.",

    "text": "I've been eating teppan style cooking on special occasions since around 1980 when Benihana was the only player in town..so I've had a few. Musashi wasn't busy on a week night and there was only 2 tables the whole time we were there so there was a little lack of atmosphere you find in busier places. The whole experience depends on the chef you get. Over the years I've had drunk chefs, chefs that were maybe the first day on the job but for the most part I've had skillful chefs. Our chef admitted up front he was enjoying his day off with some drinks and someone didn't show for work so he was called in. I've been in his boat so could understand. It showed in his juggling with the spatula and fork and when it got to the egg toss it wasn't so good. There were a lot of things lacking like tossing stuff and catching it in his hat or tossing food so you try to catch it in your mouth. I think we got the \" I shouldn't really be here cooking for you guys\" show. I ordered a bottle of chilled sake and it showed up in a ceramic sake flask. I've never seen that before. My son worked in a sushi restaurant and any sake showing up in a ceramic flask is the really cheap stuff. The food itself was O.K, perhaps a little overcooked and $3.50 for fried rice which had little else in it a bit overpriced. Musashi does give you extra sauces, chili paste and schriaca if you like spicy and he did make a garlic butter sauce but the presentation was lacking as he only got part of the sauce in the containers. The adult part of the show where he slaps rice into a penis shaped mold was a bit tacky. We were entertaining guests from a small town in the U.K so they probably never noticed it was sub par. Think we're going to stick with Toyko Waco in Los Angeles.",

I went with some friends who were regulars who knew the chefs, but it seems like they are all genuinely friendly.   The food was delciious, though the basic veggies were just ok as it's mostly bean sprouts. I recommend ordering the dinner vegetables to balance out the meal",

Everything about it was memorable... the food, the crowd, the service and the chefs (REQUEST FOR TIGER, he is the master of all Tepan Grills lol)  SUSHI... they have a roll called \"OMG\" ... when that plate came to the table it made me say OMG ... when i ate a piece of the roll, it made me say OMG... so basically we now know where the name came from  It can get a bit pricey, but you can always share :)",

Go ahead and try all of them, my favorite was the red chili hot sauce. Smokin' hot.   Our chef was John, and he was a hoot. I'm definitely going back the next time I'm in Vegas.",

    "text": "I have tried their sushi and it is very good. I asked them to make me their most popular roll, and they brought it over and it's the best sushi I have ever had.   I think all of their sushi creations are tasty. I know there are a lot of good \"all you can eat\" sushi bars in Las Vegas, but the portions here are huge and you get your moneys worth for the $15 roll.   Plus, sometimes if your date orders \"surf and turf\" teppan you might get a morsel or two of the juicy goodness, just because your chef knows \"women come first\"  They like to joke a lot and ask questions. They also do tricks with their utensils and hats as most teppan grill chefs do.   We have come here about 5 times. The teppan chefs are nice and really cool! A lot of famous people come here. You can see their photos taken with the teppan chef on the walls.   This place gets a five because I have never complained about anything here. Everyone I meet and talk to are from out of town and keep returning here because the food is good.  I want to try to Kobe teppan one day, but its $100 per person. I don't know if I want to pay that! If I win the World Series I definintely will be coming in for some kobe and sashimi!  I remember going to a lot of benihana's (in Las Vegas, and San Diego) and usually they  have Hispanic Chefs. I am not saying that Hispanic chefs suck, but the Japanese teppan chef really add an interesting personality that enhances their Japanese cuisine!  This place has a good lunch teppan menu, and happy hour. But everything they make is perfect. They make a steak miso soup, perfect teppan friend rice, and the ambiance is great. It is is the same strip mall as a lot of great choice dinning options, but if I were in the mood for steak and lobster, I would choose here over Ruth's Chris anyday.",

I sat at the sushi bar and was helped promptly.  So much amazing options on the menu - but what caught my eye was that many of the sushi rolls were names with sexual innuendo in mind.  Hilarious!  Wet dream, Japanese viagra, party in your mouth!  Lol   I ordered a lobster roll, called \"El Chapo\". (I'm 5 months pregnant so raw options were out of the question).  I've never tasted anything so GOOD!  it was melt in your mouth, amazing and the roll was huge!   I wish I could've eaten more but I was done after the one roll!      On my way out, I noticed they had pictures of the owners with TI, Rick Ross & Joe Montana!  Joe Montana's picture with the chef was autographed and he wrote \"The best!\"  He wasn't lying!  I plan on going here the next time I'm in Vegas too!    Highly recommended!",

We were told we'd have to wait awhile to be seated but ended up being seated right away. I'd suggest a reservation if you want a definite time. I liked that we could still order sushi even though we were there for the teppanyaki. I order the white girl and it was pretty decent for being made fairly quickly. Fish tasted fresh but I wouldn't come here only for sushi.   We both had the chicken, which surprisingly came with fried rice and vegetables. We were ready to order them for an additional fee, so pretty stoked to see it included. The rice was seasoned very well and was tasty! The vegetables were also good.   I liked that it came with the normal mayo based sauce and the sweeter sauce, but the garlic butter is where it was at! Soooo good I put it on everything! There was also a garlic butter soy sauce that was also tasty. Of course I got some hot sauces too, which comprised of chili garlic paste and also Sriracha. Chicken was okay, cooked well. Portion seemed a little small compared to what I'm used to elsewhere, but still satisfying nonetheless. My sushi roll and chicken dinner came to be about $17 and change before tip. Not bad at all. I'll definitely be coming back to try the steak!",

We called ahead, but got there and still waited a good 30 mins for a table to get hibachi at around 1am for the late night half price specials.  I was getting a bit impatient and honestly was close to leaving, and so glad I didn't.  The hibachi was wonderful, the cooks are funny, entertaining and good at their jobs.  Make sure you tell them if it's someone's birthday- many fun surprises will be in store for them.  It's definitely more of a late night place, as the full price menu is a bit pricy.  Overall, one of the best meals I had out in Vegas, and a very fun evening with friends.  I can't remember laughing so much in a night.  I would definitely come back here again.",

    "text": "Basically, when we called to place a to go order, the hostess very rudely told me I have to come in to pay. I understood that, hence placing a to go order. But she just kept repeating it. When I asked her why she kept telling me that (because I know I have to come in to pay) she finally said they don't take orders over the phone. I then also asked her about their late night menu and she confirmed they had one. So, fast forward 15 mins and one uber ride later and the same rude girl tells us they don't do late night menu items to go. Then she asks us if we want a table or hibachi. We chose a table. Our waiter comes over and when we ask him about the late night menu, he tells us we have to go to the hibachi tables. WTF?! The rudest hostess in the world then comes over and asks us if we have a reservation. Apparently her goldfish brain didn't recognize us from 2 mins ago nor recalls telling us to go sit at a regular table after we specifically inquired about the late night menu. We explained to her our waiter told us to come sit in the hibachi area and she replies with, \"I didn't tell you to come sit over here. UUUGGHHH.\" To which I replied, \"No, you didn't. Our WAITER did because we asked about the late night option\" (for the 10th time). This place is a complete cluster f**k and the hostess up front should be trained to properly do her job/learn some appropriate communication skills or be fired. This has 100% deterred me from ever coming back and I haven't even ordered food yet. This review is solely based on the horrendous lack of communication and terrible people skills of the people responsible for interacting with customers. I'm beyond disappointed in this experience, especially since all the yelp reviews seemed to rave about this place....Oh! And my plate was dirty, so there's that.  UPDATE: We've been sitting here for 1.5 hours and have rice on our plates. The cook is spending more time taking sake shots and doing sake bombs with 2 guys than actually cooking efficiently.",

Got to be seated with Chef Tsutomu and he was AMAZING. Funny and super talented. What I thought was cool was he made a lot of the sauces in front of you. Most of the places I've been in in the past already had the sauces done. He cooked the shrimp with yum yum sauce to perfection and my fiance filet was cooked to perfection. I would have liked to veggies before the entree but all was delicious.  At the end he cooked the beef fat. So freaking good.  I tried the yakisoba noddles. Usually not a fan and still not a fan haha but his was better than most. When you get the fried rice YES to the garlic sauce.  If I were to do it again...filet and shrimp all the way.  I will definitely be back again especially with its late night availability and try some sushi next time.",

    "text": "I am a big fan of teppan grills. For many years my favorite in Vegas had been Mizuno's which closed down a few years back shortly after the kids took it over.  It had already started to decline somewhat in popularity amongst the locals.  I had tried a few in town and settled on Hyakumi, although a bit pricy, as the best of the bunch on the strip.  Well that is now closed too, Caesars is going to make a new restaurant concept in the place after over 25 years.  Based on a couple of my Yelp friends reviews I had bookmarked this place off the strip several years ago.  Well I was on an eating frenzy this trip and made it over here.  If you are not a fan of community table eating of any kind then find someplace else.  At least 90% of the time I have enjoyed my table companions and this was no exception.  The food and the show were great!  And reasonably priced for what it is, expect $50-90 depending on what you order with a single glass of beer or wine and tax+tip.  If you want an adult themed show go late to avoid the family crowd.  I got lucky and, even though it was early. there were no young kids at the tables so the young cook was playing to the 20 something ladies I was sharing the table with.  They stay open to 4AM to cater to the crowd that works on the strip.  This is a place worth staying sober to drive to and from or paying the taxi fare!",

    "text": "I expected more... All these celebrities have been here and there's all this rave about this place but I didn't find it spectacular. I think the reason it's so popular is cause it's open till 4 am.   I had hibachi, filet and salmon. My steak and salmon were cooked to perfection I will say. (My chef was a white man, not hating at all, just not the typical hibachi experience) the fried rice was good. The salad was good. The soup was ok. The veggies were again, ok. The chef did his best but I believe the veggies could be fresher and better quality for him & also my mans lobster was very very chewy. I hear other chefs make several sauces, my group received two which were fine but I was excited to try out the sauces my friends talked about.   I ordered a bottle of sake when they took my drink order and they never brought it to me. I ended up asking my man to grab us shots from the bar .. As I didn't want to nag about the sake and end up with a surprise ... If you know what I mean. So that was kinda lame.   About 5 minutes after being seated they turned up the music a few notches, which I figured they did after midnight maybe? Cause I sat down right around midnight. But it was like really loud EDM music and I couldn't even talk to my group/hear them cause it was so loud. I honestly probably wouldn't have even noticed if I had gotten my sake :P   The price was a little more expensive than my favorite hibachi place, Ohjah. Over all a good fun place to go late night with friends for some good food. But not amazing like I have heard.",

We ordered a bunch of nigiri (salmon, tuna, uni, ikura, ika, amaebi), Royal Flush (lobster), UNLV (crab tempura, spicy tuna), True Love (avocado, spicy soft shell crab) and Elvis (spicy crab, albacore, shrimp). No, we didn't do teppanyaki.  After a looong flight, my sister was not in the mood for a darn show.  The fish were amazingly fresh.  The salmon was clean. My sister gags at the sight of brown bits on her salmon nigiri - thank goodness Musashi's salmon was perfect!  The service was mediocre.  Our server seemed to rush us a bit like there was a bunch of people waiting. \"Are you ready to order?\" every 2 minutes. Gah!  I almost want to give Musashi less than 4 stars because of that.",

The fish was definitely old and left outside for quite some time. The saving grace was the rice. The sake tasted horrible, I can't think of anything that was good in this place.

    "text": "The hibachi restaurant design is likely either hit or miss and in Vegas we are certainly not limited on the hibachi department. Enter Musashi, the small four table restaurant that most probably don't know exists except for the foodies who reviewed it to begin with. It is a no nonsense kind of restaurant, the kind that wouldn't seat me when I was 5 minutes early even though it was empty.  But of course the real question: what sets this place apart from the rest? Two things:  1) There are some unique menu items that you won't find at other hibachi locations. For example, quail eggs wrapped in bacon that explode in your mouth. Pretty darn good. In addition they have some kobe beef options that some hibachi restaurants might not have, although the upper scale ones probably still will.  2) Sauce heaven. If you go to a hibachi restaurant you usually can expect 2-3 sauces to go with your food. And they can range from decent to amazing. Well here you get 7 or 8 that they prepare at varying stages during the performance. It can seem overwhelming but there's a great variety in flavors that are worth trying. Of course I had finished my food by sauce 5 not realizing there would be more.  Overall the food quality was pretty good but not mind blowing. Of course the quality of food at a hibachi place probably has a cap and this was up there but I've had better. The ginger salad wasn't my favorite version and the soup decent enough. It's kind of a restaurant of gimmicks. One of the sauces they give isnt even a sauce it's just tiny pieces of fat from the steaks that were cut off at the beginning and turned into a little treat at the end of the meal. Tasty and cute but silly.  My rating is comparative to other hibachi restaurants and the fact is that Ive had better food at the benihana in the Westgate. That might be because I had a special waiter there who would give me 100 dollars of free food but yolo. Musashi is great and is worth going to definitely but not the best there ever was in teppanyaki.",

    "text": "I was hungry for some japanese food and the reviews was fairly good and their website boasted some good hype so i decided to give it a try.  being a chef myself i was looking forward to my dinner.   When i arrived the waiter tried to give me a seat at the sushi bar, which i did not want to sit at.  So I asked for a table and i was given a look of disgust.  (First Stike)...  The server then dropped 3 menus on the table with a thunderous thump.  (Strike 2)...  A different server then came and asked if he could get something to drink in which i replied yes i got some water since it was really hot that day.  then it took me almost 20 minutes just to look over the menu.  I was in the mood for some sashimi combo but was not offered for dinner, so I ordered steamed gyoza and fried agedashi tofu for my app.  and a unagi bowl for my main course.  i waited about 20 minutes and the waiter brings me my unagi bowl which i ordered for my main course.  I asked the waiter that should I not get my apps before I get my main course.  He then replied that its being cooked now, but the unagi bowl comes from the sushi bar.  I politely told him that it shouldn't matter where it comes from I would like to get my food accordingly.  The waiter then asked me if he should take the unagi bowl back and bring it back after I am done with the apps.  I said yes please.   After another 15 minutes passed and I finally get my steamed gyoza potstickers which was a dissapointment where i can tell it was a store bought frozen potsticker and it wasnt even cooked right.  It was mush and i just had 1 bite of that and that was enough for me.  then came the fried tofu which was salty and it was as if no one took any care in preparing that dish.  In total it took 35 minutes to cook frozen potstickers out of a bag and to deep fry some tofu. ( unacceptable)...  The waiter then brings back a cold unagi bowl which was just left out waiting for me to finish my apps...  to top it off the rice was sushi rice.  I never had a bowl with sushi rice before  and that was the last straw...  I put my chopsticks down and asked for the check.  The waiter just said thank you and gave me my check.  He did not one time ask me why I haven't touched any of my food except for 1 bite each dish.  I gave the waiter my money and ask to speak to the manager or owner.  Like I said being a restaurant owner and a chef my self I wanted to have a civilized conversation regarding this matter and to see what kind of operation they are running.  The Server escorted me to the owner who was working as the cashier as well.  I told her straight out that her food was terrible.  She just Said \"Oh! That's Ok I will take care of your bill\" and gave me my money back.  I started to express to her what was wrong with everything and she would have non of that.  she just kept saying \" It's ok , It's ok\"...  It just showed me that maybe in the beginning of the restaurant she and her husband started with a bang.  But now they run the restaurant without any care what so ever.  My opinion is if they don't want to be in business then they should quit and stop lying to everyone about their food and service.  If the owners dont care then the server and the cooks don't care either and it shows.    IF ANYONE IS READING THIS REVIEW I HIGHLY RECOMMENT THAT YOU GO SOMEWHERE ELSE.. UNLESS YOU LIKE BAD SERVICE AND FOOD..",

He definitely has a good memory and makes for an entertaining conversation during dinner with my family and friends.  His special sauces are the best.  I normally get the rib eye, but had my first taste of Kobe beef here, which was REALLY good.  Rib eye is a good choice if you don't want to spend as much, however, if you don't mind spending a little bit more, the Kobe beef was worth it.",

    "text": "We decided to give Musashi a try given the great reviews and late night happy hour,but we were disappointed. They were out of most of the sushi apps we wanted-no baby yellowtail, uni, grilled octopus salad to name a few. Given it was tSunday of Memorial Day weekend we tried to be understanding- must have been a busy weekend. We had to inquire about happy hour, as they made no mention nor introduced anything of the menu/specials. Waiter finally brought us happy hour menus. Since they were out of so many apps, decided to do tepanaki. Son wanted to do the shabu shabu but that option inot avail at tepanaki bar. Too bad they hadn't reviewed the options prior to seating. Our chef (bro of owner) was friendly, talented and probabaly the best part of the meal. We're doing the \"low carb\" thing, all ordered extra veggies in lieu of rice.  Food good, but a somewhat nice experience turned sour when we got the bill.  There were no less than 6+ \"Open Food\" items listed on the bill (ie no explanation of charge), plus we had been charged for several sushi items they were out of!  We'd had several sakitinis and belive they rely on tipsy guests not checking their bill. I reviewed the bill with the gentleman at register, he wanted no part of it and called waitress over.  She proceeded to immediately delete the sushi items.  When I inq about the \"Open Food\" I was informed that a total of $34 had been charged for \"extra veggies\"! When I said that no mention of an added charge for veggies in lieu of rice was made she started to argue talking through the gentleman at the register - she did not want to deal with me directly. I piped in that I refused to pay $34 for a few extra onions/mushrooms and zucchini-the gentleman at register advised her to remove it ,she did reluctantly with no apology - just walked away.  All told our $346 bill came down to $264...imagine if we'd let our tipsy, vacation mood overlook checking the bill. Shady,dishonest, rude and WE WON'T BE BACK!!",

We love local spots (we search for holes in the wall in every new city we visit) and this fit the bill perfectly. We also eat sushi about twice a week and this was some of the best we have ever had. Prices are good ($7-$15 a roll or upwards for lobster), the fish is fresh and the service is very fast and friendly. The menu is comprised of over 60 uniquely named specialty roles (i.e... white boy and J in the mouth). It is located only about a mile from the strip (we stayed at the Venetian and the cab ride was $10). I highly recommend this place instead of the ridiculously priced mediocre sushi places located in some strip hotels. We also inquired about desert roles, to which the chef said they did not have on their menu, then he surprised us with a roll made with oranges at the end of our meal, no charge!! Very very happy with Musashi!!",

    "text": "slightly overrated.  three friends from San Francisco go in search of the 3rd best steak restaurant in the country (according to the Travel Channel's \"Food Paradise.\") so how did Musashi stand up?  the good -- the food. a big reason to go to a teppanyaki restaurant is for the prized Kobe beef, right? unfortunately, our trio took a nasty hit at the blackjack tables earlier that day, and so we weren't feeling as flexible with our spending. i decided to settle for the more affordable filet mignon and shrimp combination, the Hosokawa clan special,  which came with miso, salad, fried rice, and assorted veggies. the shrimp was ridiculously fresh and the accompanying sauces were outstanding. the filet? i felt it was more medium than medium rare, but then again you aren't dealing with massive slices of red porterhouse you would get at a Texas-style beefhouse. the wasabi-mustard sauce was THE standout and none of us were severely burned from the \"flaming onion volcano.\" all in all, the food was good. not great, not outstanding, but good.   the ok -- the service. we sat down for drinks in their lounge and asked about sake and beer selections for the group. our host/server was a little elusive in their answer, until we asked about house favorites to which the reply was: \"well, i don't really like sake or beer. i only drink hard liquor.\" my immediate thoughts were: \"come on. at least TRY and humor us or ask someone else in the joint for their opinion. not suitable.\" ok, so maybe she was having an off night and it didn't really reflect the service from the rest of the staff. but in the end, our sake/beer questions remained unanswered by the restaurant. thank god for iPhones.   the really not-so-good -- the wait. i normally attribute abnormally lengthy waits as anomalies, but this one bordered on the absurd and essentially killed the experience. we scheduled 8:00pm reservations (after being denied a 7:30pm and an 8:30pm timeslot) and arrived around 7:58pm. after the hostess told us it would be about a 30 minute delay for the chef to finish up with another group, we were ushered in to the lounge (see \"the ok\") where we proceeded to wait about 45 minutes. after drinks, we were escorted to the grill where i was under the impression things would be heating up. alas, i hovered my hand over the grill only to find it ice-cold. after about a 15 minute wait we were informed that the chef needed 6 more people to join us before he could start cooking and the next party was due to arrive at 9:30pm. it was around 9:45pm before our grill was finally fired up. sure, the staff was genuinely polite through our wait, but that didn't help the fact that i had been running solely on an Encore Cafe Caesar salad and about five Sapporos since 1pm.   the verdict: it didn't excatly bust our budget and the food was good, but the collective feeling of our party (led by yours truly) was that Musashi is a slightly overhyped experience. maybe next time i'll try the Kobe beef.",

You can tell its him because he's the one who's wearing the Orange and black Tiger pattern Chefs hat!

    "text": "Wow. Amazing food and exceptional service!  On our first night in Vegas, my husband's friend took us here for dinner. Apparently, this restaurant was featured on the Travel Channel, and is the usual go-to place for performers, poker players, etc. during late hours. The decor is very simple and clean. It's a pretty small place. But here, I guess the food speaks for itself. The chef is very personable and friendly. He has a great sense of humor and mad skills on the grill! The food is cooked on a large tepan grill right in front of you. (Think Benihana.)  My husband and I shared an ahi poki salad and the Teppanyaki Musashi Special which included filet mignon, lobster tail, prawns, and scallops with two sides of fried rice. The filet mignon was grilled perfectly to a medium-rare...very juicy. The lobster tail and prawns were succulent. And I'm usually not a fan of scallops but they were fantastic! Very flavorful and tender. I also really love how the chef chops everything into bite-size pieces before putting it on your plate. He also had so many different secret sauces to compliment each type of food. My absolute favorite was a sweet and tangy pineapple mayo-based sauce that I ate with everything. The food was sooo flavorful and delicious. It also had a slightly charred flavor due to the grill which I really like. I was salivating from beginning until end. (I'm salivating while I'm writing this review.) Mind you, the fried rice...which I didn't expect to be anything special...was phenomenal!! I would come here after a long drunken night just for a bowl of the hearty, buttery fried rice. I've been craving for it ever since.  I know that a lot of people never leave the strip when they visit Vegas, but it's totally worth it if you enjoy great Japanese food and live entertainment while dining. I can't wait to come back!",

The owner, Tsutomu, cooked for us at the teppanyaki grill and was extremely outgoing and talented!!!  The food was incredible and cooked to perfection.  He has a wide variety of homemade sauces that compliment the dishes perfectly!!  I will definitely be going back everytime I visit Las Vegas.  I also ate at Shibuya in the MGM on this trip and it didn't even come close to Musashi!!!!!  The prices were WAY better at Musashi, as was the food and service, too!!!!  I highly recommend Musashi!!!  I also recommend reservations!",

My Brother heard about this place on Steak Paradise and we decided to give it a try...Soooo glad we did! The food was the best Teppanyaki I have had in this town or anywhere! The chef was so nice and funny too! We had shrimp, chicken and steak for our selections between the three of us and I have to say, all were equally delicious! What really stood out were the freshly made dipping sauces the chef was creating right in front of us! His creations made it heaven in our mouths, and just made everything from the veggies to the meats pop! Normally you get the same old sauces with Teppanyaki but not here, they make them right on the grill with fresh ingredients and it's that little extra touch that makes this place stand out. The staff is very attentive and friendly. Overall we had a great time and a FANTASTIC meal. I can't wait to go back.",

We showed up for dinner at 730pm so I would think this place just started their shift. As we walked in I noticed the Asian guy at the front desk did not smile at or greet our approach. After he sat us down, mind you we were seated in the booth right behind his desk, we waited for almost 10mins for a waiter and the place wasn't even packed or busy. Approximately 8mins into our waiting, I noticed two male waiters approached the front desk and they began to converse with the Asian guy. The three of them could see us sitting there waiting and not one of them bothered to assist us. Also mind you, we still have not been served drinks at the very least. I looked at my daughter and said, \"if no one comes to this table within 2mins, we are leaving.\" Sure enough, 2mins later the front desk guy walked out the front door to have a cigarette, so we walked out. As we walked out, he turned, saw us, and said nothing! Talk about piss poor service. This establishment does not deserve good paying patrons like us. NEVER will we return. There are thousands of competing Japanese restaurants so you'd think they would be on their A game...obviously not! Stay away from this place if you're hangry. Good thing I didn't cause a scene because then it would've been really bad.",

EVERRRRRRR!!!  i've been to so many teppan places in hawaiii---kobe steakhouse, tanaka of tokyo, benihana; none of them can even come close to my time at musashi.  not only was the chef super entertaining, but the food was SOOOOOO good.    i'll start with the chef---his name is tsutomu.  SO entertaining, SO hilarious, SO fast with that knife and two prong fork, did i mention SO entertaining?  i seriously had the teppan time of my life.  i don't think i've ever had a chef that made me laugh so much and dub me a new name (mercedes).  AND told a (dirty) story about rabbits using the shrimp.  AAAAND busted out so many kinky knick-knacks and toys.  it is definitely recommended that you ask for him.  now, the food---i felt like i got so much more food at this place than any other.  and so many different sauces too!  i swear there were at least 8 different ones.  garlic, spicy, sweet, ginger, mustard, aioli, etc.  i was so amazed!  my favorite has got to be the garlic one since i LOVE garlic.  i also enjoyed the fact that strips of potato were included in the meal.  i think i liked that the most.  i ordered the katana special which consisted of chicken and shrimp.  sooooo yummy.  i also had a bite of my friend's steak which he drizzled with lime (something i had never seen).  surprisingly, it was really tasty!  i ate a little bit of the lobster fried rice too and as much as i don't care for lobster, it was pretty effin great.  but of course, my faaaaaave was the dessert.  tempura ice cream! need i say more???  the next time i go back to vegas, i'm def hitting up musashi and tsutomu again!!! :)  p.s. their sushi is pretty good too! try it! p.p.s. service is awesome too",

    "text": "I have lost count of the times I have visited Musashi's over the last 5 years but I can tell you that there has never been a meal that left me feeling anything other than satisfied.  The food is absolutely amazing.  Both on the sushi side & on the teppanyaki side.  We prefer the teppanyaki side because who doesn't love a super fresh meal with a good show?!  My usual order is the chicken & shrimp (Katana).   When I need a little something different, I go for the salmon & shrimp (Ninja).   It comes with salad (yummy sweet ginger dressing), a beef soup (DELICIOUS), a shrimp appetizer, veggies, the meats (with your choice of sauce) & rice.  For a small fee, you can upgrade to the fried rice.  I highly suggest you opt for the fried rice.  It's so worth it.    We have also ordered some of the sushi rolls to start off & our favorite is the \"J in Your Mouth\" which is a deep fried Philadelphia roll (salmon, avocado & cream cheese) with eel & spicy mayo drizzled on top.  We are also huge fans of the spicy shrimp roll & lobster roll.  As for drinks - make sure you try one of their flavored saketinis!  My favorite is the white peach.  I also enjoy the raspberry.  We have a preference to ask for Tiger (the owner & best chef in my opinion) when we visit because he does make some different sauces that none of the other chefs make.  Plus we love his overall attitude.  He aims to please the customers he is cooking for & if there is anything that can be done to make you more comfortable or if you have any specific restrictions (dietary or otherwise), he & his staff make sure to accommodate you any way they can.  I have taken my daughters (one of them is in a wheelchair - the restaurant is totally ADA compliant & convenient) & other family members who have all enjoyed themselves.  Tiger puts on a great family show for the kids.  If you're looking for something a little more adult - he can absolutely do that as well!  Some of our favorite late night memories with a bunch of friends has taken place here!   I think the main reason it's taken so long to write this review is because I had too many positive things to say.  It is our favorite restaurant in Las Vegas & whenever we get the chance, we visit.  We also make sure to recommend it to everyone we know looking for somewhere delicious to go.  Heck, we have friends that refuse to come to Vegas & meet us anywhere else!  We are always happy to make that happen.  :)",

Our table had three separate parties and the head chef was BOOKED. At nearly midnight!  I ordered the steak and scallop combo. Broke da mouth! Although the steak was tender and cooked just the way I wanted it (medium rare), the highlight of dinner were the SCALLOPS. The scallops were perfectly cooked - caramelized and golden brown pan-fried on the outside with a soft, juicy center. The two dipping sauces were also quite good as well as the fried rice.   Many thanks to our amazing chef, who happened to be the nephew of the head chef, for a delightful, fun and entertaining dinner experience. He was very skilled and better than any of the other teppanyaki chefs I've encountered so far in terms of throwing techniques/tricks and cooking. He was a good conversationalist and made us feel welcome in the restaurant. Not only our chef, but also the other restaurant staff were attentive and friendly. We always had full glasses of water and were checked on several times throughout dinner service.  Highly recommended for dinner. Make reservations ahead of time if you want the head chef.   5 stars!",

After sampling the yum yum sauce as well as the ridiculously delicious fried rice, I tried to convince the chef to move to Arizona. The chicken was tender and perfection. Don't forget to add sake. We enjoyed the Kurosawa and Drunken Whale. Also, be sure to tell them you like the fat on your steak. They will grill it up and incorporate it into a sauce that will make you propose to the chef--who would only identify himself as Sum Yung Cook. You're always welcome in Tucson Sum Yung Cook!",

    "text": "\"Wait till you try some of MY sauce?\" says the chef to two ladies while standing over a pile of rice shaped like a dude's junk (The balls are even sprinkled with black sesame seeds).  Welcome to Musashi.  Great spot to unwind with good teppanyaki prepared by talented, sometimes lewd, chefs in an unpretentious, fun atmosphere.  The classic teppanyaki \"show\" is almost flawless in execution from years of experience.  Chefs effortlessly carry on a fun conversation while creating very consistently flavored and accurately cooked food.  Something very difficult to find in teppanyaki joints.  Steaks are cooked to temperature and served with eight dipping sauces, many made on the teppan cook top.  Prawns and lobster tails are sweet and cooked right.  Well cooked veg.  Tasty fried rice (no comment about the chef's sauce).  Dinner sets offer the best selection and value with most sets below $35.  Other menu items?  Who knows.  This is a TEPPANYAKI restaurant.  Get your sushi fix elsewhere.  Open till 4am.  Note:  The Travel Channel's \"Steak Paradise II\" featured Musashi for their use of \"imported from Japan Kobe beef\".  Since the import ban of 2010 it's  no longer available.",

    "text": "Musashi is what my dreams are made of.  When I think of Vegas I think of Musashi, and plan my trip around a reservation with the infamous Tiger.  Later is better, as in order to enjoy the whole experience it is best that there are no children at the table.  The food is so good.  I stuff myself until I am miserable. I know better, but I never learn.  I am always sad for the fried rice with yum yum sauce that stays behind.  Each time when I give myself the pre Musashi pep talk, I promise myself things like, \"I won't eat the vegetables\"  and \"I'll let my husband have the  shrimp appetizer.\"  But, it turns out, I'm a liar.  The veggies are as tasty as the rest.  Now, let's talk about sauces.  I am a lady who enjoys condiments, on everything.  Musashi gets me, there are so many different freshly made sauces each bite of each course is an experience.  I have considered asking for a straw, but I would be distraught if they decided to never let me in again.  The last time, I was in Vegas I figured it all out though.  Musashi two nights in a row.  If you're going to spend $50+ per person for dinner, your might as well ensure you are getting  quality food and entertainment.    In summary, if you like good food and dirty jokes and a break from the strip Musashi will blow your mind.",

    "text": "Warning:  Do not come here for Japanese food.  The food is not authentic and does not taste good.  We only came here for dinner since it was close by our hotel but definitely not worth stopping by.  I ordered the chicken teriyaki which came with vegetable tempura, salad and miso soup.  The salad had a blob of dressing on top that looked like glue and incredibly unappetizing.  Miso soup was ok.  Vegetable tempura was greasy to the point that the oil was congealed to the skin of the tempura. The chicken teriyaki had so many grill marks on it that I didn't have much chicken to eat when I tried removing the outer layer.  Needless to say it was a dinner that was not worth it and much better off going somewhere else.",

We did not have a reservation, and we waited about 5 minutes to be seated. The service was outstanding and the food was incredible. They have a very large menu selection as well. This is one of the best teppanyki places I have visited in Vegas.   Gluten Free: They did not have a specific menu, but the waitress, as well as the chef, were able to tell me exactly what was gluten free. The chef also cooked all my food on the grill first so there would be no cross contamination with the soy sauce. I was SO IMPRESSED. I am always so thankful when people take my allergy serious and this place went above and beyond!",

We had a fantastic Teppanyaki chef who was both entertaining and dazzled me with his \"tricks\" as he cooked our table's food - which tasted amazing, by the way!

Also, he cooked my tofu before he cooked the meat - this probably wouldn't mean much to a meat eater, but means a lot to me, since I've been a lifelong vegetarian for health and ethical reasons.  I can't lie, I was a little worried about it, since everyone else ordered meat dishes - but I was not disappointed; huge points with me!

The chef made a couple of dirty jokes and we thought he got the hint when none of us were amused BUT then he told me he would bring out a special ice cream for my 30th birthday. Before I was even finished eating my dinner they brought out a SPECIAL ice cream. They made a penis shaped ice cream with a whipped cream penis and ice cream balls. My friend was so uncomfortable she actually excused herself. You would have thought it was my bachelorette party! It was unbelievable, I wish I would have gotten a picture of it but my husband destroyed it pretty much right away. I also heard the conversation of another chef and he also was inappropriate. I got the feeling that was just the atmosphere they cater to. I know we are in Vegas but this was really the only raunchy experience I had on my vacation. Made for a unforgettable memory, that's for sure. Don't bring your parents or mother in law here!",

A friend of mine who resides in Vegas took me here my second night in town and had me try some new sushi. Being that it's been over a month since my visit here I kind of forgot exactly what I had...lol, I just know it was good and did not leave anything on my plate so Musashi succeeded in continuing to attribute my like of West Coast sushi over East Coast.",

Was hoping for a memorable adult experience which was requested and kindly asked if not permissible then we would come another time but was sat any way with an underage couple and two elderly ladies! Sadly disappointed. I understand accommodating but I specifically asked to be seated with adults only for an adults only experience. We were happy to wait too at the bar. Because I am not a meat person asked for extra rice with the entree he ordered and was served the scraped off remnants from the grill instead. Cook was entertaining at the beginning until it was realized the couple to the left were young and the couple to the right may be offended, then it stopped! Definitely not what I expected and sadly disappointed needless to say we will not be coming back. Food is way better at OSAKA!!!",

    "text": "From beginning to end, my first Teppanyaki experience was one in a million.   My co-workers chose this place for our unofficial holiday dinner, and it couldn't have gone any better! From start to end, this place had delicious food, friendly wait staff, intriguing atmosphere, and everything else you could possibly ask for in a great restaurant.  As we all trickled into the restaurant, we ordered drinks and a few sushi rolls from the bar. The sushi chef was excellent, and a True artist. Every roll that was presented looked absolutely stunning and delicious. Believe me, they didn't just look delicious, they knocked your socks off in flavor. Unanimously, the \"Grand Finale\" roll(refer to pic) killed the competition. So delicious!  After a few minutes, we were sat at our table. We placed our orders, and were all able to order from the happy hour menu which starts at 12am and ends at 3am. Everybody was ordering hot sake, and Asahi beers(both were under happy hour). We also ordered a few bottles of their chilled Junmi Sake(refer to pic) which everybody, even the non-sake drinkers, thoroughly enjoyed.  As soon as our Chef, Chef Nick, came out from behind the japanese curtains separating the kitchen and dining room, he was the best entertainment since Leo Gallagher and his famous sledgehammer. He was truly HILARIOUS, entertaining, and artistic. The Teppanyaki was everything and more, than what I could have ever imagined.   This restaurant experience was a one of the best I have ever had. When you have the pleasure of dining with close friends/co-workers, and feel as though you made more friends after leaving then when you arrived, its simply incredible. Thank you to not only Chef Nick, but all the staff at Musashi for an amazing night out!",

But a friend that regularly has business in Vegas wanted to take me there and I'm always down for hibachi.  Walking in, when I'm used to visiting the typical tourist places on the strip and in the casinos, I was definitely thinking this would either be a great experience or a reason to stick to the easy stuff on the strip.  While we waited, we went ahead and had a sushi roll. I don't remember which one, but it was great.  It turned out to be really good all around. The chef was very entertaining and the food was great. I kept it simple and just went with the chicken, and it was delicious.  Overall, I'd definitely come back. It ended up being nice to get off the strip a bit (even though this is still just like a block or something from the strip) and go to a non casino restaurant.",

I probably would have given 3-4 stars but my wife and I both got really sick after.  I am not sure if this food caused our stomach issues but after evacuating the food we both felt better.

He ran through the motions. Next to us a very fun chef had his people laughing the whole time. He had the animal print chef hat, so maybe if you ask for him you'll have a better experience.  The food was good and, like other reviews have mentioned, about 8 sauces are made throughout the dinner, with many really tasty ones. Loved the garlic butter. Fried rice was delicious.

I always go with steak and shrimp. The cooks there always puts on a show for you to make sure your visit is phenomenal.

But, I guess the upside is that these shows do work and get people through the door.  The bar wasn't huge and on the dark side.  But, that was fine with me, it was good ambiance.  Also, the price for JW Black wasn't crazy.  Good pour.  We had a very fun table, everyone was into it and had a good time.  I've found at teppanyaki joints this is key, the more your fellow diners are into it, the better of a time you tend to have.  Our table was full and people were into it.  Also, the group wasn't entirely tourists, I'd say it was at least 50% locals.  The starters were standard for this type of meal.  Our chef was very colorful and more skilled than many other teppanyaki chefs I've had in the past.    We had the Musashi special, which is basically every meat they have.  The steak was cooked exactly to order.  The seafood (shrimp and lobster) was very tender and not overcooked, but also not undercooked.  The sauces were excellent accompaniments, and the fried rice was very good.  I've had much worse at similar places.  Service was fantastic, ready when we needed more drinks, but certainly didn't distract from the show.  Great night.  Recommended.",

They also make you sauces to have with your food and I am not taking about pouring a sauce out of a plain already made sauce bottle in a bowl for you, they mix it, and give you about 4-8 different sauces for your food.  There really isn't much to say about this place other than I love it!!!! I even took my brother there when he was visiting from Houston, and Houston has soooo many places to eat and he also agreed it was the best teppanyaki he has ever had!! The food just tastes amazing!!  As a tip **make a reservation they are always packed!!!",

    "text": "Musashi Japanese Steakhouse When in Vegas....some of the better restaurants are located just off the strip...that Musashi Japanese Steakhouse was just that.  So, after dropping $400 on a Black Jack table (losing 7 out of  8 hands) in less than 10 minutes it was decided that it was time for dinner.  At least the room was comp.    Whisked away in a large black vehicle our party arrived at Musashi Japanese Steakhouse.  We were hungry, we were ecstatic....no wait, no line....what a way to go.  We were seated, drinks ordered and menus were served.  Here is what we decided on:  My Ex-Girlfriend  <a href=\"http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/BcW7Z9lPmOB_8eS2lEuOqQ?select=O4JtnWgrryVq3aLDTTFYnQ#O4JtnWgrryVq3aLDTTFYnQ\">yelp.com/biz_photos/BcW7...</a>  99% Roll  <a href=\"http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/BcW7Z9lPmOB_8eS2lEuOqQ?select=O4JtnWgrryVq3aLDTTFYnQ#mfMYDmaLojuTHenrx-1BbA\">yelp.com/biz_photos/BcW7...</a>  NY Steak  <a href=\"http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/BcW7Z9lPmOB_8eS2lEuOqQ?select=O4JtnWgrryVq3aLDTTFYnQ#wcfYoMtMWEiJctnRK8dpPg\">yelp.com/biz_photos/BcW7...</a>  Ika-Yaki (Baked Squid)  <a href=\"http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/BcW7Z9lPmOB_8eS2lEuOqQ?select=O4JtnWgrryVq3aLDTTFYnQ#kMmweG5KHbbIklQFy0KWiA\">yelp.com/biz_photos/BcW7...</a>  Broiled Salmon  <a href=\"http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/BcW7Z9lPmOB_8eS2lEuOqQ?select=O4JtnWgrryVq3aLDTTFYnQ#zPyvxdok-7JyeWyqJKUGmg\">yelp.com/biz_photos/BcW7...</a>  It didn't take too long before our food had arrived, but we were running behind schedule as we were....there was another table waiting for us at another event....so we still asked our server to please hurry up....sure enough our food began to arrive.  First the Ika-Yaki.....for those of you who like Baked Squid, this was not a bad dish.    Next was the Broiled Salmon....the Salmon was very fresh and not over cooked.  Very moist and tasty as it was covered in Teriyaki sauce.  The sauce was just about right, not an over dominating flavor.  This was followed by the NY Steak and Rib-Eye.  I have no idea what a NY Steak is doing in a Japanese Restaurant....but that was what we had ordered.  The Rib-Eye was a much better cut, soft and tender, juicy and topped off with some Teriyaki Sauce.  The NY Steak was done the same way, not too bad...I can't complain much about the NY Steak...just that my preference would be the Rib-Eye.  As we were half way through our meal...the rolls began to come.  The 99% roll came first and was all too good to not eat one piece but you just had to eat 2 pieces or more.  We had one more roll coming.....and our server had just informed me that our Ex-Girlfriend will be a little late.  DARN!!  I picked up my phone and called my Ex....she's late as usual....  Ok....I need to settle down a little....I should have gone for the Porn Star instead.....would have been rolling in style.  So finally our Ex-Girlfriend shows up and we just devour her as quickly as we can.   To my surprise it was very good.  Crab, avocado, spicy tuna with halibut tempura and spicy mayo.  Next time I'm going for the Porn Star, she'll be at the table before the Ex-Girl Friend.  I'm also looking forward to their Kama Sutra roll next time.  Overall, the meal was exotic, climatic with loads of orgasmic flavors.  Such an explosive meal....off to the next event.  Will be back for the Porn Star for sure!!  Place was clean, bathrooms clean, not too loud and a nice atmosphere.    A restaurant to try when in Vegas!!    4 Stars",

The service was quick, out chef was amazingly funny, as there were 3 ppl with birthdays at my table. If you don't have a sense of humor with the jokes this place is not for u as it can be a little Rated R. The food was delicious and portions wee a good size, i had the chicken, fried rice and gyoza while my friend had the steak and prawns. All in all i highly recommend and would be coming back whenever i am in town again!",

I am telling you people don't waste your money or time I don't care if Brad Pitt, or Obama ate here.

    "text": "Musashi Japanese Steakhouse was definitely my absolute favorite and best teppanyaki experience, ever.   The Samurai Special II with NY steak and scallops was perfect for me! My food was cooked and played with at our teppan station by our beloved chef! Each moresel of food was exquisite! And even better with the sauces that were presented to us.  There were a plethora of sauces and I had a hard time keeping track. Each one was delicious and unique, so I can't really give you tips on which one to go for.   All Teppan entrees served with miso soup, salad, rice, shrimp appetizer, and assorted vegetables. We had a lot of fun with the shrimp appetizer! Chef Tsutomu made shrimp bunnies!  We also tried the lobster fried rice, which was also very tasty!  As for dessert, I highly recommend the tempura ice cream. Yes, tempura battered and fried vanilla ice cream! And it is just as great as it sounds. :)  ..and it's not just the food that makes this place great!  Chef Tsutomu is such a ham. He's hilarious and good at what he does. He is both an expert cook AND an exciting entertainer. If you're thinking about dining at Musashi, request Chef Tsutomu! You definitely won't regret it!!!",

Their miso is red/brown and not the traditional dishwater white miso that's so awful. They also serve some of the best calamari you will find. It's tender and cooked perfectly. I've had sushi, teriyaki chicken, miso, calamari, beef negamaki and several other dishes here and all were excellent. It's become a staple for when I'm in Vegas. The service has also always been top notch and I'm typically there really late at night.   I'm planning on eating there again to see if the last visit was just an off night. I'm really hoping it was.",

    "text": "First off overpriced for such little portions. Over hyped , and last but definitely not least I asked the server how the tips work here because he was literally the only one that helped us out personally and I wanted him to put it in his pocket . With that being said, he told me that it's tip pooled witch is fine. But after asking what percentage of it does he get after they split it off. He said he didn't know.... what?? How is that even possible??? So that's the owners decision on how much they get when they split. They put all the cash tips into a jar and than all credit card tips are added up and whenever the owner feels like splitting it off he does and doesn't tell them how much they made in tips pooled together at all. Doesn't give them a percentage or anything at all. How do you work like that?? He splits it off whenever he wants sometimes takes up to weeks longest this server said was a month he waited once. And he just gives them watever he wants to give them whenever we wants. Doesn't tell them how much they made nightly daily nothing. Doesn't tell them servers any numbers at all. Just pays them as they work that's all. How unfair and how honestly pathetic is that. The owner is robbing his own staff. How selfish and greedy of someone to do. You make enough off ripping your guests off with their tiny portions already so stop robbing your hard working servers tips. If I can give negative stars I would!!",

The food is usually very good and they stay open very late, which should be a more common theme for Las Vegas restaurants. The chefs almost always put on a show while cooking the food right in front of you, but occasionally you'll get a chef that is having a bad day and just cooks the food without doing any tricks (like when my wife's parents visited from Brazil). The sushi is also very good. I also suggest getting the mochi ice cream for dessert.",

He created 8 different kinds of sauces for our meal, each as good or better than the other. The prawns, scallops, filet mignon, fried rice were amazing! I wish we would have tried the lobster but there was so much food! The staff was friendly and they take their last food orders at 3:30 am, making it a good spot for a late meal!

He kept our large group of 11 entertained the entire meal, with his dirty jokes and various gag toys.  Lots of fun and good food, which puts this place at the top of my teppanyaki list.  First off, he creates about 7 different sauces for everyone (half of them made on the teppan grill).  The tricks start right from the beginning, with veggies and fried rice cooked before your main entree.  I ordered the Steak Lovers special, which included 3 cuts of beef, which included some kobe imported from Japan.  This included some special fried rice, which was made with some kobe beef fat.  The fried rice was solid and I was glad it was seasoned very well and not overly soy saucey.  It was hilarious when he started to pack a penis cake mold with fried rice and... haha just check my photo and you'll see.  I almost forgot the house soup that came out to start, which was this peppery short rib broth soup, which was delicious.  I also tried some of the rolls my friends ordered and they were pretty good.  The place is about a mile off the strip and the cab cost was around $8 from the Venetian.  It's a short trip from the strip and you could easily walk there if the weathers nice.  Also, be sure to make reservations and request Tsutomu when doing so.",

He put on a very entertaining show, and he prepared the food wonderfully. He also prepared about 5 or 6 dipping sauces for various parts of the entree. The meal was a tad more expensive than similar places I've been, but I feel like I got my money's worth. This is one of the best Japanese restaurant experiences I've had. They're also open late. If you're in Vegas and looking for an entertaining outing, and great tasting food, check this place out.",

My fiance put a dinner together with 12 of our friends (original reservation was for 8) Hostess was rude and didn't even want to try to accommodate the additional guests at a different table or at the restaurant all together.  It was not that busy we could have easily been seated together at another table/grill.  The waitress kept pushing my guests to get by instead of asking to move out the way.  We rushed to order. The only highlight was chef tiger. He was fun and changed our mood though when it was time to pay the rude waitress and hostess wetr back to tell some of the guests cards declined yet all the bank apps showed charged approved. It was my birthday! 4 of our guests left, 8 of us ate and left very disappointed .... customer service is everything and if i gave one star because of tiger! No apologies, not even a thank you as we left. So frustrating. Time to find a new japanese restaurant :(",

NY steak was tender and the salmon was impressively moist and tasty. We also got a side of Scallops which was awesome. Opt for the Fried rice, taste delicious (but greasy). . Their sushi was just ok so stick with the Teppanyaki. Enjoy this place",

    "text": "We were there with a large group, which I'm willing to allow some service issues for, since it's tough serving about 20 people all at once. However, our orders were taken by group so it was divided up pretty reasonably. We were at a table of six.  We order donburi almost all the way around, except we had one Japanese pizza order, which sounded interesting. I received my chirashi probably 20-30 minutes at least if not longer, before anything else came out of the kitchen (my wife sent it back to be chilled since it was out so long). Next came the tempura and some of the other food including some fried rice. The Japanese pizza was nowhere to be seen.  The food was adequate. And I should have known better, but the sushi was not great.  The tempura was no worse then anything I've had before, but the selection of tempura was lame - a mix of broccoli and shrimp with maybe a potato (?) or something. No carrot, no beans, nothing else in the vegetable department. The shrimp tempura, however, was slightly mushy.   After nearly an hour the Japanese pizza came out and was immediately returned because the dough was not cooked. At all. When queried they said the delay was caused by the time it takes to cook the dough. Clearly that was not the case. It is frustrating to be told the order was put in at the same time as the rest of the orders, yet when you finally receive the dish it clearly hasn't been cooked properly and clearly was rushed to the table. It was replaced with some tempura which was fine.  The worst part, and the part that hurts the review, was after the meal we all felt sick to our stomachs, rendering us useless for almost two hours.  Suffice to say, we won't be returning and I have warned off the rest of my friends.",

If you're able to, try to make reservations for the teppanyaki as they seem to have a lot of large parties - the rest of the restaurant was empty.  This is definitely a good place to go in a larger group of up to 10 for teppanyaki.  The restaurant is a little located off the strip, but worth the drive.    I was really suprised and excited to see that they had some really  \"authentic\" izakaya food on the menu and at really reasonable prices.  We had some sushi rolls and the teppanyaki meal.  Having gone to Benihana and Tokyo Wako plenty of times, I have to tell you that they season their food better than the others.  Everything was perfectly cooked, the staff was friendly, and it was a great show.",

The salad that came with it was decisively not fresh, eh what is the point of stale greens.  The steak came out medium well, and the shrimp was a bit on the dry side, the meat was covered with garlic almost to the point of taking away from the flavor of the meat.

I really wanted to like this place because it isn't Benihana and I thought I would get a great experience from an independent tepanyaki place.  Also, I saw this place on the Travel Channel and thought it would be a good idea to give it a try.  Our chef was the owner, (the one they showed on the Travel Channel episode) who I have to say was very entertaining with his wit and tricks, BUT the food was not that great.   The main issue I had was that the majority of the food was over cooked. The shrimp that he made look like little bunnies, sat on the grill for way too long and actually started to darken and toughen up.  The fried rice had hard pieces in it because it sat on the grill too long as well.  We both ordered the filet for our entrees and it was overcooked from how we requested it.  I was pleased that he offered a variety of sauces but that didn't take away from the over cooking of the main dishes.  Aside from the chef being more entertaining, I would have been happy to have gone to a Benihana instead. I don't know if this was a fluke or not and I may give this place another chance but based on my one experience, I would be hard pressed to not go somewhere else.",
