On my first visit I ordered the chicken and waffles. The service was GREAT and the food was awesome. I was so excited, I told everyone! I took my husband just a few days later and the experience was night and day!   I've tried it four times since then and the service has been AWFUL. Most recently, I found HAIR IN MY FOOD!!   The cashier, who identified herself as \"Lace\" was RUDE!   I am so disappointed because I thought that this would be my new breakfast spot. It WON'T!  Small businesses really need to be careful who they let operate their establishment. I've seen so many good places driven into the ground because of people like \"LACE\". .",

My wife had the pineapple/banana smoothie which was better tasting.  The fried chicken breast was overbreaded and dry which would've been ok if it came w/gravy. I suggested to them that they not put powdered sugar on top of the chicken and leave it for the waffle,  and speaking of waffle it was soggy because of the chicken on top. I told all this to the girl at the front desk taking our check and she credited the waffle.  My wife's Philly steak and eggs was excellent and I would highly recommend.  The waiter rushed us and gas bad timing.  Overall experience is good from the place itself and the food.",

I didn't even need any frosting, butter or syrup..! it was AMAZING! the next time I went, I ordered the Ultimate steak and eggs with hashbrowns & my daughter ordered the chicken fried steak. Both were extremely huge & delicious! I can't wait to try more & DEF will be back sooner than later for sure!! Pricing is pretty average and you definitely get your money's worth!

The second time we came in on a weekday morning and it took about 10 minutes for anyone to acknowledge us at the door and get a seat. Once seated it took about 35 minutes for us to get our food. We also noticed that a few tables around us were getting impatient as well with the flow of food/service. The family sitting next to us ended up getting their whole check comped due to having to send their food back twice because of the temperature of their food. We assumed that maybe this second visit was just a bad day/one off. The third time in, my father ordered coffee and his first creamer cup showed up super dirty and he had it sent back. The second creamer was dirty as well and cracked on the inside of the spout. When we touched it part of the porcelain came off. If that had been in his coffee then we would have had a serious issue. Other than the service, the food is pretty good but we will not be back for a while.",

The managers solution was to have me drive by to pick up a voucher... the reason I paid the postermates charge was so I wouldn't have to drive anywhere. Their food is alright, just not worth the hassle. Mimosas Gourmet on Durango has way better food and customer service. I suggest you go or order from there.",

Walking in we found a staff dressed in pajamas, and they were as friendly a team as you will find in Las Vegas.  Seating is spacious, with lots of room between tables.  This also leads to a low room volume; just loud enough to have a buzz, but not so loud that you can't hear the music playing or the server speaking with you.  The food was good, and the price was right.  People talk about the rib eye chilaquiles and they are right - it's a good dish.  So is the corned beef hash, and the requisite \"green\" juice - kale, cucumber, apple, and honeydew. And it is a great place for kids.  There is a little play area outside with artificial turf, and inside a kids menu with decent selections.  We found this one morning thanks to fellow Yelpers, and we agree that it is a good place.",

The waitstaff in pajamas is a wonderful touch and the adorable floral umbrellas overhead really brightened my day.  We came here for a very late brunch last Saturday, around 1:30-2pm? The menu was full of delicious sweet and savory things that just looked decadent and to die for. I have a hard time eating heavy food early in my day (yes, I'd slept in on a weekend in Vegas, sue me :P) so I opted for something a little fresher than the pancakes and country fried steak fare - a NY strip steak Caesar salad (dressing on the side like always). I ordered my steak rare and WAS IT EVER RARE. I love my steaks borderline mooing and this was beautiful. It was really thinly cut and just melted in my mouth. The romaine of the salad was crunchy and really fresh, and the bite to the Caesar dressing was a great complement to the steak.  I had a few sips of a friend's banana-berry-other-things smoothie and wished I'd ordered one myself. It was a little seedy but the flavor was on point.  I was, like always bummed to hear \"Is pepsi okay?\" when asking for a diet coke, and I wish I'd gotten a sierra mist or something instead of the minute maid pink lemonade that's just kinda sweet and tasteless. Oh well.  My friends were all taken aback by how delicious their meals were. I stole some fries from one and they were skinny, crunchy yet fluffy, and seasoned beautifully with a little garlic and herbs I think?  I'd love to come back here, maybe on a day when I've somehow gotten an early start (or maybe come in on a morning flight so I'm ready to stuff my face upon arrival) so that I can try some of the more luxurious things. But I'd love to come back!!",

The only reason for the missing star is for the servers. This location is always busy and always very full. There aren't enough servers to accommodate all of their tables and it is definitely noticeable for small things like not getting enough refills, having to get up and go to the server station and ask for things like syrup or butter. It isn't the servers fault but they give too many tables to only one server and they get overwhelmed and can't give every guest 5 star service. Otherwise, the food is incredible, the hostesses are awesome, and the atmosphere is nice but they definitely need more help!",

Great recommendations by Chelsea, our server, and great service. She was very knowledgeable about the menu and friendly. The atmosphere was very calming and friendly for breakfast-goers.  A++++",

The portion sizes are more than generous and the Southern Style Chicken Fried NY Steak and Eggs was absolutely mouth watering! Thank goodness my friend and I decided to split a plate . And they serve french press coffee! Need I say more? This is definitely gonna be my new breakfast go to place!",

We randomly came by Rise & Shine and it is hands down my new favorite spot in all of Vegas.   They have a fresh squeezed juice bar. The meals are filling and they have the best hash browns I have ever had in my life. On top of the fact that they specialize in steak and eggs they also have a lot of healthy options from vegetarian to the meat lovers.   Even if it's not an option make sure to try the 'pot of bread.'   Thanks guys you made my trip!",

We waited 10 minutes for a table  which was exactly how long she told us it would be.  Our server Amberly was very friendly.  She took the time to explain a number of items on the menu.  Our drink orders were brought in a timely manner.  The food arrived fairly quick and tasted as good as it looked.  I had the french toast/platter and my wife had the eggs benedict.   The noise level inside the restaurant was a little high.  But that could be remedied by the addition of soundproofing material on the ceiling.   Overall our experience was very pleasant.  We will be coming back again to this location.  Once again, we want to commend Amberly for her high level of service.  We will be asking for her on our next visit.",

After looking at all the photos, we were convinced we had to try it out. SO GLAD WE DID!! The food was delicious!! I had the sausage biscuits with eggs and potatoes. The gravy was so good, perfect consistency, the biscuits were awesome, eggs - perfect! It must have come with bacon (or I stole it from someone elses's plate) but it was good! The Mister had some big breakfast with ham (I think), don't really remember, but it looked good and he was VERY happy with our meal. Our son had the philly chessesteak omelet (again, I think), and he loved it. The prices were great, too! All three of us had a wonderful meal and it was under $50! Service was amazing! From the guy who seated us, to our server, to the cashier, they were all great! The only downside was the wait - took almost an hour to get seated outside, but it could have been because there were numerous sports tournaments in the area and the place was packed. We will definitely make this place a breakfast stop-off during all of our Vegas trips!",

Wait to be seated is kind a long and not to mention 20 minutes wait to get our meals .. All that might be forgiven taking in mind that the place is new and needs to find its system yet . However when we got our gogo fresh juice with rotten cucumber as decoration and also bluberies in the fruit cup were all rotten..that just killed my taste buds.. Our server offered us new juice as we didn't drink even half of it but I just couldn't. . At least I was expecting not to be charge for something that should not even leave the kitchen which we were. So ... long wait to be seated , long wait for food which tasted good, that yes ..but fruit and veggies should be fresh in my opinion .. Would not go back ..",

I thought it was a mistake which no biggie but on the receipt that is how she put it in the system even though she blamed the cooks smh. I must say I don't have interest in going back. Also I did enjoy the watermelon drink but if you are like me and enjoy eating the fresh fruit the out on the side of the glass do not do it don't even try it my watermelon slice tasted spoiled very rotten.

    "text": "Rise & Shine is a very good American breakfast place. Me and my beautiful wife arrived there on a Sunday morning after having a terrible experience trying to grab some crepes at a small restaurant. The little restaurant got invaded by a large group of cyclists . Let me tell you about that first:  The cyclists were everywhere, I mean everywhere!!!! Sticking out of the restaurant in a large line; mostly speaking Chinese with a bunch of cameras  hanging in their neck. They had their bikes  standing all over the place and could not decide what they wanted to order. After standing at the door  letting them in and out because the line was so long, while that restaurant had only one guy cooking crepes, we decided to move on to our next bookmarked restaurant.  So, that's how we ended up at Rise & Shine! At first we were really mad about the cyclist group, but then we were glad they were there. Otherwise we would not be here at Rise & Shine right now. As we arrived in the restaurant we were welcomed by a wonderful hostess that took us to a nice table right the way. The only downside I feel about the restaurant is that the main room is very large and noisy. Besides that, this place is perfect.  They have really good and healthy food , which is our main concern as we millennials and we love an extremely healthy life style. So, lucky you for reading this review because I'm going to tell you we ordered and why it was so amazing. First of all, their portions are huge, I mean, we both do #crossfit and we eat a lot, yet still we were able to split the Ribeye breakfast dish... it was really cheap if you take in consideration that it came with two eggs, a large piece of meat  and chips with salsa avocado and beans. We also ordered two fresh juices, check my pictures of you don't believe it!!!  Rise & Shine is a must go if you are looking for a place that will fit your entire family in one large room with very large portions, cheap prices and the best quality of all: HEALTHY!!! We were pleasured to be serve by AMBER, who recommended the Ribs dish, and confirmed that the juices were made from fresh fruit . Thank you Amber, thank you Rose & Shine  for the amazing experience. Ah, one more thing, thank you Chinese  cyclists  for taking over the little crepes restaurant ;)",

Love the decor & colorful upside down umbrellas & humorous other knick knack (socks, pix).  Every meal we past was fried or covered in whipped cream.  Possible that's what they are known for & why they got so many stars.  As we were seated, I had to grab a napkin to wipe off my seat, which I hate to have to do.  It has become a pet peev of mine.  I do like that as a breakfast place they have the jelly, hot sauce & sugar on the table.    Collin our server was very nice & quick.  He also had recommendations when we asked what to drink & about their specialty 'pot of bread.'  I was not impressed w/ the taste of the pot of bread, but the presentation was very cute.  It tasted like bread w/ a slight hint of cinnamon, nothing special.    My friend usually gets iced tea so is a great critic of it so when I saw his face after the first dirst drink I knew it wasn't good.  He described it as iced tea made w/ regular tap water.  Gross!  Collin recommended the Watermelon Strawberry juice, which was probably the best part of Jeffs meal.  He got the Bangers Omelette & I did the Lox Omelette, which I perfect at home.  My omelette was ok.  It was unevenly filled.  One bite was cream cheese, one salmon, on capers & horrible onions that I picked out.  They serve Lavazza coffee which is ok.    I will give this place one more shot.  My dad loved the Loco Moco & I see its w/ beef & spam so dad needs to try it!  Also, next time I'll try something fried like the country fried steak.",

Get yer coffees French Presses and or Fresh squeeze juice from all kinds of fresh veggies and fruit. We tried the Go-Go Green , kale cucumber green apple honey Dew etc . (No pulp ! Tasted Great)  Plenty of options on the menu and I mean plenty!  I've had  a hard time choosing all 3 times I've gone.  The Avo-Veggie Benny is what I think I'll try next !  I've tried the chilaquiles with a steak and they were great but you better come with an appetite for steak and eggs.  This last time I went I ordered chicken and French Toast. It's not on the menu but I requested they switch out the waffles with the toast.  They went to the back and asked and it was a problem. score !  The Salmon Lox omelette we ordered turned out to be a home run as well. Some words I've heard from my peers when going to Rise n Shine was \"I'm so glad we came here\" \"this was a good choice\" etc. the service has been good when I've gone on my 3 visits. Like most breakfast spots this place will get busy so come ahead of time before you are hungry ! Or wait after the rush! It's a descent size place with a patio and has its own unique decor , the inside almost gives me an Alison Wonderland Betsey Johnson type vibe lol . Good job guys. I'll be back.",

The decor, the menus, and the servers outfits all make the ambiance of the restaurant very fun and inviting and remind you of just waking up and rolling out of bed to have breakfast at a friend's cabin.  The one think you have to order is the pot of bread. It's not really a pot, it's like a cinnamon roll made in an espresso cup and comes to you warm and gooey. They also serve it with homemade cream cheese sauce to dip it in and that is one step away from heavenly goodness! So yummy, don't miss it!!  We ordered chilaquiles and chicken and waffles and we really only needed to order one or the other. The portions are incredibly large so be prepared and come with your appetite.  The other thing they do that goes above and beyond the norm, they warm their maple syrup up!!! Oh yes, you read that correctly -- warm maple syrup...it changes everything!!  Oh and if you're new to the restaurant, the server will take you on a tour of the menu!!! How adorable is that!?!?!?   I would most definitely go back!",

So, we arrived at 10:30 am and we wait 10 minutes or so before we could sit and order.  Our food came out around 11:30 am.  We came at the same time as several large parties and I think our order just kept getting pushed back.  My over-medium steak was charred to a crisp and easily half the size of my normal steak.  I didn't want to wait for another steak I was hangry.  And the last time I asked the Owner a question she was snappy and rude.   So I am going to take my $45 elsewhere. The server told us we should review the service, not the steak on Yelp.",

    "text": "Excellent breakfast spot! I was inspired to try it after seeing it in my news feed with a well deserved \"review of the day\". Yelp did NOT steer me wrong! I did not understand having steak for breakfast until recently trying chicken fried steak for the first time. I now get the magical combination of eggs and steak, especially if the steak is dressed in crispy batter and smothered in delicious gravy :) That is what I had here. The country fried steak with eggs and hash, pancake, cup of bread, and fresh carrot-green apple juice. Sounds like a lot? It definitively was! I was full for the entire day AND had half left for breakfast the next day. I don't think any chicken friend steak  will be as good as the first one I had but at Rise & Shine it came pretty darn close. I enjoyed the sausage gravy and appreciate being served two cups of it, one is never enough. The potato hash was nice and crispy on the outside and eggs were made as I wanted them, over easy.  My honey wanted the Ultimate steak and egg breakfast but with New York cut instead of ribeye. Accommodating his request, presented no problem and he loved his meal. He also had an everything bagel on the side (greedy!) that was fresh and yummy. We shared an old fashion pancake, large enough to have as a breakfast on it's own, moist and fluffy - really delicious. I also really enjoyed the cup of bread, it's kind of like a cinnamon roll in a cup with warm cream cheese frosting on the side. Really yum. The fresh squeezed juice paired perfectly with glorious breakfast we had.  Aside from great food, our server was sweet and accommodating. I appreciate the ability to customize and add what ever you want. The restaurant has a charming decor, with flowers everywhere. Wonderful, care free experience at Rise & Shine.",

As the first time I came in, I ordered my steak at a medium rare temperature and my steak came out completely burnt. I tried to use A1 sauce for my steak but because it was so burnt the A1 sauce couldn't take out the charcoal taste. I wasn't able to take another bite of my food because I was so disgusted.

    "text": "There are two main reasons im giving this place such a low rating. 1. Being the food/prices &  2. Being the service.   I was very excited to try this place as I had seen it frequently on my drive to work.   Lets start off, I came here for the first time this past weekend. As soon as we were seated in our booth our waitress came to take our drink order, then headed off to get them, I ordered the watermelon strawberry juice, my sister got a Pepsi, and my mom orders the Green Juice. 10 minutes pass by and she is no where to be found, she finally comes with the Pepsi and 3 waters. My mom inquired about the juices and the waitress very rudely replies with \"Yeah i dont know whats taking them so long\" as she gestures towards the juice bar. So i asked her if she could go check for us if they were ready, and she gave me the death stare of a life time and replied with \"UM YEAH I GUESS\". She brings back the juices which are deceiving in picture on the menu, 5.25 for 8 oz of juice in a tall glass; what a rip off. After we got all our drinks it was time to order the food.    Im a sucker for Eggs Benedict, I ordered the Steak and Eggs Benedict bagel. When our food got to the table my Benedict sauce was coagulating and separating, and my moms sourdough toast was cold and stale as a brick. So I asked if I could have them bring me new sauce on the side, and new toast, the waiter rudely informed me that I would have to pay 2.95 for a tiny size of extra sauce. I tried to explain to him that it was already cold and separated, and he spoke over me saying \"I cant control the temperature in here\". Obviously that is not what I was trying to get through to him, so I just ordered the extra sauce and left it at that I was too hungry to go around in circles with him.   To say the least the quality of food was poor for the prices they were asking. The Benedict sauce was cheesy tasting and tasted as if it was out of a package. The eggs were snotty and slimy, poached eggs are supposed to have fully cooked whites and a runny center. The steak was charred to a crisp and when I brought it to the waitresses attention she said that it was because the base for their season steak rub is coffee grounds so it gives it a smokey flavor. This was not a smoky flavor this was completely burnt ash, and 40% of my steak was fat and gristle.  The french press coffee was bitter and gritty and tasted like nothing more than Folgers.    Asking for anything was like pulling teeth, both waiter and waitress gave us major attitude and made it known that we were an inconvenience to them. When it came time to pay up at the front the receptionist asked how our meal was and we were honest. She said \"I appreciate your honesty and I will relay your feedback to the chef and the manager\", in the most fake tone ive ever heard, and as soon as we started to turn our backs I saw her roll her eyes and shake her head towards our waitress like we had just been ridiculous and rude. Which we were not, we were very nice about everything.   I usually try to give places a second chance before i rate them but I dont think i will be returning. I dont like paying to be treated poorly when I ask for wrongs to be made right.   Summary: Overly priced low quality food and bad customer service.",

    "text": "We stopped in a little bit ago to celebrate my nephews early birthday. We were greeted sweetly and seated quickly in a big comfy booth. The atmosphere is so dang cute, definitely \"rise and shin-y\" there's twirling umbrellas hanging from the ceiling, little metal roosters in the corner and lots of other eye catching sun shine-y decor. Our waitress came quickly and took our drink orders and our food at the same time because we were ready. She was so awesome! Our waters came out right after we ordered them and shortly after our carafe of freshly squeezed orange juice that was so divine! Nephew ordered the rise and shine burrito without any cheese, after the food runners brought out the food our waitress stopped by to see if everything was delivered and if there was any cheese at all on my nephews plate (he was so impressed because nobody ever asks) he said that it was absolutely delicious and the refried beans on the side were the best he's ever had, he practically licked his plate clean! my hubby and I shared a buffalo chicken (sauce on the side) with eggs and hash browns plate with a side of biscuits and gravy. There are Not enough compliments to describe this heavenly plate of food, perfectly seasoned, crunchy  and huge breast of chicken, thick cut yummy hash browns and perfectly fluffy scrambled eggs! The sausage gravy and biscuits were a perfect touch and we both left full and happy! Our cup o'bread didn't end up coming out with our food so our waitress brought us extra. They were so dainty and cute, fluffy and that cream cheese syrup dipper was amazeballs! Our waitress was never too far away if we needed her and it was probably the best customer service we've ever had at a restaurant! We will definitely be adding rise and shine to our regularly visited spots!",

I don't understand since Hashbrowns are literally just shredded potatoes and maybe some seasonings or veggies. $1.95 for a fruit plate. It at least was a decent size rather than a cup of fruit you would get elsewhere. I had the steak and eggs w/fruit instead of potatoes, no toast due to allergy. I made note that my daughter and I would be sharing and we both have a dairy allergy, please use no milk or butter. I ended up having a mild reaction, so that made me unhappy. Otherwise, it's kind of hard to screw up steak and eggs- one of the more simple dishes. Husband had ham & egg Benny. He said it was good and the vinaigrette was unexpected but unnecessary (hollandaise and vinaigrette was overkill sauce wise ). He said Hashbrowns were burned on the top layer and not cooked through the middle. Service was a 2.  I wanted to like this place. I wanted to LOVE it. I did not. Our server couldnt have acted like she cared less that we were there. We sat for probably 7-9 minutes before coffee was brought out. Never were given water. Had to ask for extra utensils. She brought out coffee once right before our food was dropped and there was no refill. Never an ask if we wanted anything else (more coffee, to go cups). It was full but there were several servers on and it wasn't insanely busy.   It wasn't a spectacular experience. I don't expect much from breakfast joints- you go to breakfast out of convenience or leisure, not to really be wowed. I can just say that this place is probably not for me. Might try once more and hope for a better outcome.",

Have also tried the Steak and Egg Chilaquiles and the Steak and Egg Benedict with Spinch. Get the Coffee with your own personal French Press. I try to stop on here when I'm on this side of town. You will not be disappointed. The flaw is the restrooms need air freshner. A nasty smell of Sulphur and Rotten Eggs all throughout the restroom. Get some of those Air pump timed sprays or call Roto Rooter. Seriously !!!",

First off, we went at 10:30 on a Sunday. Obviously, we are expecting a wait. We were told 25 minutes and they sat us pretty close to that time frame. We got a nice booth by a window. That was a pleasant surprise. One thing I noticed while waiting was the fresh juice station. That was a really neat touch and something you don't see often. It also helps swallow the $3.25 for a glass of apple juice.   So things were starting out pretty well. The menu is expansive. Lots of options. My dad ordered ham and eggs and my boyfriend and I ordered The Ultimate Steak and Eggs. We also ordered a stack of pancakes for all of us to share. Then, we waited. And waited. And waited. Again, understandable since we could see it was busy. Still waiting. At least 30+ minutes went by. Finally our server, Brody, came up to us and said, \"Sorry for the wait on your meals but there was some confusion in the kitchen with your ticket.\" I can't stand this excuse. All that means to me is that our server forgot to ring in our food, our ticket was lost, or the kitchen messed something up. But please don't say that to me like we don't know what's going on. The best way to handle that situation is to say, \"I'm sorry about the wait on your meals. I've notified a manager of the situation and we are working hard to get your good here as soon as possible. Let me grab your pancakes so you all have something to munch on.\" We were brought our bread. About 10 minutes later, our food arrived. One of us missing toast. And of course, not a pancake in sight. And no mention of them coming. So I told him to forget the pancakes. The hash browns were good. The steak was okay. None of it was stand out. I feel like I could have gotten this meal anywhere.   When we went to pay, we mentioned our disappointment to the cashier who also did nothing to try to remedy the situation. No manager came by to check on us. 40 minutes or more waiting for food is ridiculous. Even when you're busy. Most entrees come to your table within 20 minutes. The only reason I know any of this is because I've worked as a server in restaurants for over 5 years. This just wasn't a great experience because of the service. I'm happy to go elsewhere.",

With the fresh juice they offer, I wish they offered a flavored iced tea. But overall, great dining experience. Good service and food for the amount spent.",

It's made with the usual French toast ingredients with cinnamon toast and corn flake cereal, powdered with powder sugar with a whip cream topping. It was simply delicious! I ordered the chicken and waffles plate. I was excited to be having this plate since it is one of my favorite dishes but I really didn't like my plate. The chicken was bland and my waffle was extremely soggy. Needless to say I was disappointed with my dish. Now with this in mind, I was wondering if I'd give this place another shot. Let's just say if it wasn't for my husband's dish, my answer would've been no. Since his plate was delicious, I'd definitely would give this place another try but the chicken and waffle will definitely not be even considered.",

When I first saw it, I was thinking how big of a place it was. After we finally figured out how to get in, the decor was something else. The staff wore pajamas, there were rotating flowers hanging from the ceiling, there were paintings of farm animals. It was very interesting.   Talk about the portions! I ordered Chicken Avocado Bacon sandwich. Price was about $9 and it was so big. The chicken comes grilled or crispy. I decided on crispy and it definitely had a kick to it. It was spicy but the right amount of spice. Comes with skinny fries, my favorite.   The beau got the ultimate steak and eggs. Comes with 3 eggs (or you can order it with 2), hash browns and a large portion steak. The beau really loved the flavor. It tasted like it was cooked in the grill at a BBQ. The toast was even so good and it came out with whipped butter! Bomb!   We ordered iced Italian roast coffee. It was pretty good but I think next time I'm going to get caramel roast coffee.   Can't wait to come back and try other items on the menu. This place looks promising!",

They add balsamic vinegar to the top of the hollandaise which makes it rich and delicious! This most recent time my hash browns were  a little too crispy but still tasted great.  The staff is always speedy and friendly as well.  This place is almost always busy but if you're willing to sit on the shaded patio, you can usually skip the wait.   There are plenty of good places to grab breakfast in the city, but make sure to check out Rise & Shine, as you'll probably also add them to your short lost of favorite breakfast places.  And don't forget to share a cup o' bread with the table while you're there!",

    "text": "If you like a hearty breakfast, Rise & Shine is your place.  I stopped by the Flamingo location to give their red velvet pancakes a try. The parking and entrance set up are confusing.  The parking is on the side and behind the building.  There's a sign directing you to a ramp but I found it easier to walk through a section of parking lot.  Once inside, I was seated quickly.  The dining room is spacious and has all kinds of great eye candy hanging inside.  I believe this building used to house Joe's Crab Shack and they've done a great job of making you forget that.    The menu is huge.  Every breakfast food imaginable is on the menu.  My server (male, forgot his name) was wonderful.  He was busy with many other tables but always kept my drink filled and made sure I was completely happy with my meal.  The red velvet pancakes were monster sized!  I'd guestimate that each piece was easily the size of a frisbee.  There were three pieces.  I wasn't crazy about their cream cheese dressing as it tasted like it had a hint of cinnamon in it.  Their warm fresh maple syrup was delicious on its own, but a little sweet for this particular pancake which were dusted in powdered sugar and contained chocolate chips.  I'd definitely recommend this place for breakfast lovers, large groups, and anyone who is in the mood to try something new.",

Their pancakes are also good but be careful when ordering them because they are huge! I'm sure one person can share one pancake. Also their bread in a cup is always warm and delicious.

I'll start by saying the place itself looks really cool!  The vibe is super chill, big space, and all those fans on the ceiling add a unique spirit to the place.   The food (breakfast burrito, hash brown, chikilitas and more) was good! The right combination between breakfast and brunch place with a touch of Mexican flame to it.   The one thing I didn't like, and most likely will make me not come back will be the service. Not that it was bad, it was ok, but honestly I expect more than just ok from a place like this. Bottom line it seemed like the servers (all of them) give you the feeling like they're doing you a favor. The servers dress in Pajamas which is a cool concept, but honestly I didn't appreciate their moody tone of voice like they just got out of bed.   Trust me, I know food! And good service too :)",

    "text": "Wow!  The name says \"a Steak & Egg Place\" and it's legit.  This is how you do steak and eggs, and how you create a place to enjoy eating.  Let's start with the service:  the hostess greeted my wife and I as we walked in and had us seated immediately, offering us a choice of seats:  booth, table, outdoor.  Our waitress (Chelsea) was right there with us but never in the way or overbearing.  Drinks were ordered and delivered quickly and we were given time to look over the menu--the pretty large menu!  All the usual breakfast options were there, along with a real variety of steak options.  I had the Steakhouse Omelet and was pleased when Chelsea asked me how I wanted my steak cooked.  I've had steak and eggs in a number of places over the years, but it's oddly uncommon that you get a say in how the meat is prepared.  I ordered medium and it came out perfect.  (The picture I posted didn't really do it justice).  The omelet was fluffy and full of generous amounts of everything the menu said would be in there.  My wife had the \"Two-Fisted Bagel& Egg Sandwich\" and it was put together and presented just as well as my order.  Be warned though, you might want to eat this breakfast sandwich with a fork and knife.  You can pick it up with two fists, but there might be spillage.  A few of the little things that make a nice place even better:  the cream for your coffee is fresh and comes out in a creamer rather than the more common bowl of plastic half & half containers just sitting on the table.  Water and other beverages are served in glasses, made of glass.  Each table also has a tray with salt and pepper, and a solid assortment of the more popular condiments and sauces that go well with steaks and eggs.  The restaurant interior is cool too.  Umbrellas for light fixtures, a sort of at-home feel to the tables and chairs, and a waitstaff that serves you in their pajamas.  I originally thought it might be little awkward, but it actually works to set a very comfortable environment.  Keep in mind, it's been our experience that it's hard to get in without a long wait during peak breakfast/brunch hours on the weekends.  That's because it's that good.  But if you're able, head over on a weekday and treat yourself without the wait.  Finally, ample outdoor seating and a military discount (present your ID when you pay) locks in my high score for this fine addition to the local breakfast scene on the westside.  Go and enjoy.  Your mouth will be happy!",

    "text": "The entrance to this place is a bit confusing. You'd expect it to be somewhere facing the parking lot, which there is a ramp for handicapped access, but the main entrance is around to the back facing the freeway. As I walked in, I noticed right away that the dining area is very open and spacious, with high ceilings and a variety of seating arrangements. On a Saturday morning at 9am, we were seated immediately. Not bad.  The hostess seemed to be in training. We followed her to our table and the entire time, she kept looking at someone else to make sure she picked the right table. I would've appreciated a more personal greeting and some eye contact. The server was better, refilling coffee every few minutes and checking to see if everything was okay.   The menu was very confusing. I expected to see STEAK & EGGS, yet the first thing I noticed was an entire column dedicated to freshly squeezed juices. What? Apparently they have a full service juice bar in the corner. Graphically, the menu itself uses a hundred of different fonts and it just makes things look busy; nothing really leads your eye to their very small selection of actual steak & eggs.  I opted for the loco moco. I always like to try loco moco from places because there is usually a unique spin on it. I know what the traditional loco moco tastes like, so trying something new is always fun. What this place does is they use a ribeye patty and a \"gravy-yaki\" gravy. IMHO, I am not a fan of the gravy. I like regular brown gravy and teriyaki sauce separately, but in this attempt at combining the two just totally took away from the overall simplicity of what a loco moco \"should\" be. In terms of taste, it's almost there, but not quite. I think it needs another pop of flavor to tie everything together. The ribeye patty, on the other hand, was cooked to medium-rare perfection. Props to the chef in that regard!  The payment process was such a mess. It's awkward enough that they verbally ask you how much you'd like to tip on the card, but the way the girl handled the receipts and not being sure which receipt to hang on to and such just put the cherry on top of an overall, awkward experience.",

    "text": "Wake up! It's time for breakfast!  Well that was how Cesar Q. and I felt this morning.  We've seen the pictures and all the reviews so it was time for some steak and eggs!  The location is great and very convenient.  Just off the 215 and Flamingo.  It's in the old Joe's Crab Shack building.  The ambiance is bright and the building is huge so lots of comfortable space.  We sat inside at a 4 top table but noticed the awesome outdoor dining once we had already ordered.    I never ever order chicken fried steak!  However, after seeing the incredible pictures posted by my fellow yeeps I took the plunge!  I orders that which I never order and I liked it! I'm sure my hips will appreciate it too.  My meal came with a choice of eggs and bread.  It was also served with the home fries that were truly amazing! I just may swing by for an order of these yummy little carbs all by themselves! They are that good!  Anyway I selected scrambled eggs and to my disappointment they were from a carton, not fresh scrambled eggs!  When your at a restaurant that specializes in breakfast one would expect fresh cracked eggs.  I opted for the biscuit as my bread choice.  It was just ok. The gravy that came with my chicken fried steak tasted homemade.  I really enjoyed it.    On a side note, it was really nice having all the sauces on the table so I didn't have to ask.  Not only was that convenient they also had cholula!  So many times places only have tobasco! YUCK!  There was also ketchup and a-1 steak sauce.  The service was efficient yet our waitress didn't seem \"happy\".  She was ok but did not give us the feeling that she enjoyed her job. I do feel it took a long time for our meal to come out (25 minutes) however my husband did order a steak with his eggs that were over cooked.  He did mention that the steak was great!  I felt comfortable as the staff was wearing their PJ's.  Pretty cool concept!    I opted for the 4 star rating as all in all the meal was quite good.  If I could have done 3.5 I would have.  Would have preferred fresh cracked eggs.  I will be back for some of their coffee and those damned potatoes! I'm still thinking about them!",

Several tables outside and a few more inside with early risers.   We get a table and begin looking over the menu and I notice the servers are in PJ's, kinda weird? Any way we place our drink orders, they have the usual but have added some ice coffee's, juices and smoothies!   I am a big fan of omelets and of course I go for the fancy steakhouse omelet, tenderloin  steak, cooked your way, cheese, mushrooms, onions and spinach with a bernaise sauce, hash browns and choice of toast or pot of bread.  I usually get toast but today I tried the pot if bread, warm, cinnamon smelling good, but only the top done, inside the cup, 'it's RAW' as Gorden always says!  My steak omelet was really good, steak cooked perfect and the lemony bernaise was so good.  My husband enjoed his spicy rub ribeye chiliquilies, and we shared a short stack red velvet pancake! It was all very good.   Service was good, food was good and reasonable priced, but they should work on the doughy pot of bread.",

    "text": "During my Sunday morning bike rides, I had seen that Rise & Shine was opening a new location close to where I live.  I had been to the original one and I wanted to try this.  I was going to stop the week before but remembering it was Mother's Day and I knew the place would be slammed, I waited a week to go.  I went inside and had my name put on the list and requested a patio table.  When I was taken outside, I was told to pick any place I wanted.  I chose a two top in the sun.   I was left a menu and as I looked at it, my server stopped by and asked about coffee.  I ordered the French press coffee which says 2 cups.  It yielded three plus.  I ordered the S'mores waffle.  It was a waffle with some marshmallow fluff, chocolate syrup, whipped cream, and some Chex cereal for the graham cracker.  With the waffle I was served warm maple syrup with some cinnamon sticks infusing the syrup and two small cups of soft butter.  The waffle was good but I was expecting more marshmallow and less whipped cream, and Chex cereal is not really a good replacement for graham cracker.  Some squares of real graham cracker would have been better.  Service was good but I must note that I don't understand the seating problem this place seems to have.  Evidently, one person write names down, where the person requests to sit, and then hands off the person with a menu to one person who seats people coming in.  The patio was 1/3 full, the interior was about the same, and yet I waited for about 5 minutes before being shown outside.  It just seems like an inefficient system and when they're busy, I can understand the reason for the backup.  One note, if you ride here on your bike--yeah, I know, few of you will--you can lock it up using the boards on the ramp going to the entrance as the anchor for your cable and lock.  I'm glad I tried the new place.  I won't be a regular.",

On Sammie's suggestion I had the Strawberry Watermelon juice which was light, a little sweet and delicious.   Then, being torn between breakfast and a steak, I ordered the ribeye chilaquiles. The Steak was very well seasoned and perfectly cooked. The chilaquiles were very enjoyable.   Once my watermelon juice was delivered the piece of watermelon attached to the glass fell off onto the table. Sammie was beside herself, then came back with a plate full of watermelon replacement pieces! This is the kind of dedication to the customer that creates repeat visitors-and deserves this type of review.   Congratulations \"Rise and Shine\" is a big WINNER!  Cheers!",

    "text": "My family and I walked in around 1pm a few days after they opened and we were seated promptly.   The restaurant is very large, unlike many other breakfast spots in town, so I was already pleasantly surprised. The decor is fun with spinning flowers dangling above the dining area and fun pictures to admire on the walls.  For my entree I decided on the fried chicken breast and waffles while my mom and fella both opted for different versions of the chilaquiles. As a last minute decision we ordered a pot o bread when we saw a bunch of them come out of the kitchen for another table, tempting us.   Service was slow to start, but I cut them some slack since they just opened and are finding their groove. It got better and more attentive as the meal progressed.   Our food came out and the portions were enormous, making me wish we had shared. My chicken breast eclipsed my waffle on my plate and I wish they had not places the chicken on top of the waffle since the heat seemed to make the waffle limp and a little mushy. The flavor of the waffle was good but the chicken wasn't as good as I expected. It was cooked well but the flavor of the batter seemed off. It had a spicy kick but still seemed very bland and had a starchy aftertaste that I didn't care for.  My mom and fella raved about their chilaquiles and after sampling them I can't say I agree. The temperature seemed a bit on the colder side and the cheese wasn't entirely melted. The steak that came with my fella's meal was a little over cooked and the seasoning was a bit overdone. He loved his dish, so I guess that's all that matters. The pot of bread was awful, I don't recommend this at all. It was dry and flavorless. I took a bite and left it alone.   Overall, the service was good and the food was hit and miss. My family loved the meal so we will likely be back, but I will be sure to sample a different dish next time and hope for the best.",

My sandwich was huge, and tasted delicious. However, there were barely any grilled onions :( he enjoyed his waffle, and ordered a French press, that was tasty. I hadn't been here in a while and forgot they drown EVERYTHING in parsley, and my fries were covered in it, which destroyed the taste.

Ordered the same thing, the ultimate steak and egg, medium well and eggs scrambled soft. Got my food and had a overly super duper cooked steak!. I was hungry too! So it goes back and the waitress brings just the eggs and hash browns & says, I didn't want you to be hungry! . I ordered my food at the same time.. They bring me out a bloody a$$ steak! Yo!! I'm done, so may I get a box, I'll go home and cook it myself. No manager, no anything came over. 19 minutes later, still sitting here with no box, had to ask for coffee again. So the tip game is a wrap! I always tip at least $15! Sad to say, I won't be back, nor bring anyone I know here. **At least my brother's food was good- He said***",

It was very busy during our visit and everyone seemed to b loving it. Our waiter was fantastic, friendly and quick. Unfortunately my tea tasted like toilet water. It was so horrible that I had to order a new drink after one sip. I had an omelet with wheat toast. The toast was simultaneously burnt and cold. My omelet was fine.   (Seat check) we had to clean old food from our own seats before sitting down.  They have no breakfast sausage at all. They only offer banger sausage which is more like a bratwurst. I thought this was really weird.   The very appealing looking pot of bread was described to us as a cinabun mixed with fresh baked bread. We're not fans. It tastes like regular bread with a hint of cinnamon.  Although the food was very underwhelming I will probably give them one more chance in the future. The problem is there are 4 or 5 fantastic breakfast places near me who always get it right.",

They're so.... weird. And leave a weird aftertaste. But again, the other stuff we've had (loco moco, omelettes, cup o bread, that amazing ribeye etc.) has all been good.

The wait wasn't as bad, but the service was definitely lacking. It felt very unmanaged. There were three hostesses(doing nothing) and one person cleaning up tables(very slowly). There is a serious lack of structure as the waiters were all over the place, very frantic and not very friendly. Our waitress couldn't even take our whole order at once. She had to do drinks and then food. She seemed very incompetent. And the pajama uniforms are just ridiculous. Maybe if they all matched that might look okay, but otherwise it's very unappealing.

Waited to even get water to the table, had to go inside myself and get silverware. Over 45 mins later looking around for our food, we were told the large parties food just got pushed out ours will be next. & the prices are rather high for an off the strip breakfast place.",

We waited roughly about an hour for our party of three to be seated. Once seated we waited a while to be helped. Our waitress was not friendly or attentive, her attitude towards. As for the food, I ordered the breakfast burrito (steak and chorizo) and the pot of bread. The burrito was ok, nothing special or tasty, and the pot of bread was very tasteless. It was literally a plain piece of bread with a bit of cinnamon inside and a side of butter. I don't think I'll come back, or recommend the place to anyone else. I did not like the insane amount of time one has to wait to be seated, the quality of the food or the poor service.",

The atmosphere is adorable with all of the umbrellas spinning on the ceiling. It entranced my 5 month old baby.  I ordered the steak and eggs. My steak was a horrible cut of meat, trying to find something to eat off of it. I said something to the waitress. She apologized profusely and said she would tell the manager. He or she, not sure because they never came over, took 15% off of bill... It was $1.99 off the entire bill... Um thanks but no thanks. The rest of the food was good. What bothered me the most is that this FAMILY friendly restaurant does not have a baby changing table anywhere in the restaurant. My baby needed to be changed, desperately. Parents you know what I'm talking about... And we went into the ladies room no table, plus there is no counter space. So we had to wait to get home. When I asked about he changing table, the hostess kind of just shrugged me off. Why would there not be a Koala Kare in the restroom, in fact BOTH restrooms. Again family friendly it is not. This is not a big deal to most; but it is for a mom dealing with a baby.",

Who ever is in charge of the operation aspect of the business needs some education on running a restaurant. They leave tables open for prolonged periods while people wait and then sit people at 4 tops when there are only two people and two tops are open. Another negative is that they have a patio but don't utilize it and there doesn't seem to be enough seating inside.",

    "text": "My first time going to Rise and Shine with my bf. We were told that the kitchen was going to take a little longer today; we didn't care. We sat down and ordered our food. My bf ordered orange juice water,  plan pancakes,  eggs, hash browns and sausage. I order banana, pecan frosted flake pancakes and a water. It took 45 minutes to get our food.  Waitress was nice but 45 minutes isn't a \"little\" wait. Service was good and food was good. I was disappointed when I received my pancakes but didn't say anything to the waitress because I didn't want to wait another 45 minutes for a redo. My pancakes had banana foster style bananas on too , brown sugar & pecans everywhere, whipped cream with frosted flakes on top of that. I can't have dairy so that ruined my frosted flakes. I don't like bananas foster style cooked bananas. I assumed they would be sliced and inside the pancakes, but they weren't. The menu didn't mention anything. After a few bites I started feeling very sick; I realized they must add a lot if milk to their batter (which has never happened to me before)Also the bill came to $45. That's ridiculous for 2 people and what we ordered. Just disappointed overall.  Sorry but I won't be coming back",

Then after we ordered, it took an extremely long time for our food to come out only for our food to come out cold and for the waitress to forget my friend's bread in a cup. When we asked about the bread, she claimed it didn't come with our friend's meal even though the waitress asked said friend to choose between the bread in the cup or toast when she told took our order. They also charge $1.00 for a side of ranch. I would not recommend wasting your time here.",

When my wife had mentioned it to a co worker they said \"oh the one on flamingo, we live that place\" what!!!! There is one close to me.  So as the weekend neared I was pretty stocked to ride over. All I could think of is ultimate ribeye and eggs.  So as my wife and I was seated I was ready to order. I glanced at the menu and was ready as my iced tea showed up.  I put a little spin on my ultimate ribeye. I wanted a little spice so I had them add it and ordered my eggs over medium and extra crispy hash browns. The best part is the bread (toast, biscuit, or a cup of bread) I haven't ate any bread in weeks. So the cup of bread was a hit. Five stars for the cup of bread.   It's a pretty nice size place. Use to be a Joes Crab Shack. They have spinning umbrella lights. Waitress wear pajamas and the bus boys wear a shirt that says \"spooning leads to forking, so don't forget to use the condiments\"  I'll be back for sure",

    "text": "VISUAL AESTHETIC: 5/5 The exterior of the building is a mix between champagne mango and mustard yellow with a macaroni and cheese colored roof top. There is an outdoor patio with seating available and a small grass area circled with a fence behind it. Overall, it gives a sort of \"barn-like\" feeling. This ties in with Rise & Shine being a \"steak and eggs place\", so you think of cows and chickens.   Inside the restaurant is spacious, tables not too close that you would feel harassed while having a conversation or intruding someone else's. Rise & Shine has floral umbrellas hanging upside from the ceiling, which are absolutely adorable. Overall, the decor is witty and gives a diner feeling.   The waiters and waitresses are all dressed in pajamas which is a quirky plus that I found was not only cute, but suitable to market the brand of the business.   FOOD: 4.5/5 I had brought a friend along and she ordered the fried buffalo chicken breast with hash browns and scrambled eggs, with the pot of bread. The sauce did not soak through the batter rendering the crispness to be soggy, which is a plus because many of the restaurants I go to unfortunately do this. The eggs were fresh, and the potatoes were hot, crisp on the outside, with a soft tenderness within.   I am not a first time customer and ordered my usual: the New York strip steak spinach Benedict on an everything bagel. The taste was replicated as my prior visits, however I found that the cut of steak was much smaller this time around with the amount of spinach being quite sparse as well. But overall, the bagel was toasted perfectly leaving the inner bread tender but the exterior nice and crunchy. I asked for a medium rare steak and my expectations were met.   SERVICE: 5/5 Typically Rise & Shine has great service, and I had that experience today as well. Our waitress constantly checked up on us to assure that my friend and I were satisfied and had everything we needed. From refills to containers for packing, she made sure to even bring along the check right away.   OVERALL EXPERIENCE: 4.7/5 Breakfast is essentially easy when it comes to appeasing a large audience, at least when it comes down to average food, service, or visuals. To exceed expectations, niches are required, right? Rise & Shine gives great service, fresh food, and an adorable environment to tie it all together.",

Not too sure about staff wearing PJ's, but the reviews coaxed me to try it. As we enter, at first glance I see this location is very spacious. Tables are evenly separated. The decor is bright and whimsical. Then I crowd check, not bad. There are enough guests to say \"this place is a crowd pleaser\".  Lucky me, no waiting. We are greeted and seated rather instantly.  Waitress is very friendly and professional.  I ordered the chilaquiles with a hard fried egg Hubby had biscuits n gravy and we split 2 pancakes.  Inquired about the coffee, a fine Italian Import. Hubby was given a sample and really liked the  Rich strong flavor, so he ordered a cup.   The GM was on the floor, checking in on guests. It was so nice chatting with her. Can't wait for their new location to open.  The best part was the 2 giant pancakes staying hot thru the meal!  Everything was very yummy!   Warning: Portions are large  Open: 7am to 3 (Just in case there are some late sleepers reading my review.",

Thanks to my little sis who's a local, she suggested coming here and I'm glad she did. Everything on the menu looked delicious and I ended up ordering the Chicken Fried Steak, which is basically a platter of food.  You get a small cow that's battered in a nicely crisp coating/crust. Was quite easy to cut into and dip into my country gravy that was also used to douse my biscuit.   Two eggs (any way you like it) over easy, was fun to crack and let the yolk ooze over my chicken fried steak which was on top of a layer of shredded hash browned potatoes. The potatoes were still crisp and enjoyable. I'm not a fan of soggy hash browns.  It was a lot of food, but I can handle it and I was on vacation, so I deserved every single bite and calorie that I consumed.",

There's big bright flowers on the ceiling that spin. The waiters and waitresses wear pajamas. I've been here 3 or 4 times now and I've had excellent service every time.    My favorite things to order here is the French press coffee and the pot of bread. What's a pot of bread you ask? It's pure heaven in a little ceramic cut. Similar to a cinnamon roll but no icing. It's usually served with butter and warm cream cheese like sauce for dipping. It will make your tummy really happy, I promise! Once you try it, you'll be hooked!

Arrived at 11am and waited 15 minutes for a table. By the end of our meal, it was actually pretty empty.   Menu has lots of good options, it took awhile to decide what I wanted to eat as there seemed to be lots of delicious breakfast items to choose from. I finally opted for the Ultimate Steak and eggs, while my friend went with the Smoked Salmon benedict. We each ordered a juice (orange for him, strawberry watermelon for me) $4.95 each....ouch. Served in a 12 oz glass.  I ordered steak medium rare and eggs over medium. Eggs were perfect but steak was overcooked. Nice pot o bread and crispy potatoes on the side. Steak was nicely seasoned and still tender even if overcooked to medium well. My friend said the smoked salmon was really good with plenty of salmon and the hollandaise sauce seemed homemade instead of out of a can. I'll try that next time.  Service was just ok, nothing great about it. It took a good 20 minutes from order to receiving food, and then an extra 10 minutes after completing meal to get the check.   I'll come back as many of the meals on other people's plates looked good. Chicken fried steak, and the pancakes looked delicious.  Food 4 stars, service 3 stars, prices 3 stars.",

    "text": "What a huge disappointment this place was.... The restaurant is super cute and the staff are in their cute jammies. Everything on the menu sounded great, especially the ribeye steak breakfast, which is what I ordered....  I ordered my steak medium rare. It was raw. They seriously threw it on a grill then flipped it and threw it on a plate. The steak was still frozen!!!!  My potatoes were like hay, super dry! Never got my toast. Finally after having my food for about 15-20 minutes my server checks on me.... She asks if everything is ok? I say no, my beef is still mooing. She says oh no, let me get you a new steak. She takes the steak and returns with my same steak!!!! Ummmmm, I thought you weren't supposed to put food back into a cooking kitchen after it's been dropped to a table....??? Gross! So you're telling me, other customers returned, contaminated food, has been on the same cooking surface that everyone else's food gets cooked on??? Disgusting. I wish I had something nice to say about this place. Oh wait, I do, my friend enjoyed her French toast. Luckily she shared so I had a few bites while our server was helping other tables. Oh and the good thing was they took my meal off the check!!!! Well almost my entire meal. I still had to pay for my coffee which I did not drink, because it tasted either old or too dark of a roast or something.... it just was gross. Poor management. They could give a hoot if any customers return.",

    "text": "Wooooo-Hooo  I've had chicken fried steak in 9 different states and this is by far my absolute favorite! Absolutely in point, it was so good a tear almost came down my eye from the party in my mouth , the gravy was flavorful with a mild kick. My other half had the chicken and waffles and let me tell you that waffle was crack, the syrup dispenser had cinnamon sticks in there which added another dimension of lip-smacking flavor I didn't want to end. The portions are HUGE so good luck finishing the entire plate. It was our first visit and our server Samantha was very helpful and nice ( nice smile )since the menu is big and my wife is finicky. We will definitely be back for more of this deliciousness. If you want a party in your mouth and not worried about calories go by put that food in your mouth and enjoy it'll be worth it.",

Today we chose to rent a vehicle and sightsee. As a treat I found Rise & Shine and surprised my wife with a nice breakfast here.  Our server was Amberly and she was extremely pleasant and attentive and provided an exceptional quality service experience.  The food was next level and very filling. We had the crunch cinnamon French toast and are leaving with leftovers and can't wait to eat it again at the hotel!  This would absolutely be almost daily place to eat if we lived in Las Vegas. One day. For now we can only dream!",

I ordered the ultimate breakfast steak and eggs. My steak was grossly undercooked(rare) and I ordered Medium. I let my server know and she took the steak so that it could be cooked more.  It came out well done and practically burnt.  To make matters worse my waitress was hard to get a hold of and I had to finally call over a manager to explain that the meal just wasn't edible.   Instead of offering a new steak or taking it off of our bill, she gave a $5 discount and said have a great day.  I think this place is just too understaffed and unexperienced to handle a busy Vegas community. Super disappointed with this location.",

I had the iron baked Belgian waffle recommended by our server with a side of fruit. It was delicious and perfect for breakfast. The fruit was sweet and fresh, it was the perfect accompaniment to my big 'ol waffle. I didn't think the waffle would be satisfying but it was and I enjoyed it tremendously.   Bottom line: If you're looking for a breakfast spot in the area, this place is worth checking out.",

There was a small area that had merchandise to buy. it looked mostly like socks.  The place was big, spacious, and looked clean and organized. It looks like it would be able to host a big group.  Our waiter was wearing nursing scrubs (or I thought they were). I figured that he either got off a late shift from the previous job or was about to go to his second job. I didn't think anything of it until I saw a waitress not in working uniform either. Then it hit me.. Rise & Shine... breakfast... pajamas.. Pajamas = working uniform - haha clever.  There were so many things on the menu that I kind of got hit with analysis paralysis. I ended up settling for my safe pick, chicken and waffles, which did not disappoint me. I liked that the chicken was flattened, it makes it easier to eat it sandwich style. I like to eat my chicken and waffles with syrup and hot sauce so I was happy to see it already on the table. My friend got the steak and eggs which looked really good as well.  Unique style, big and spacious, good food, friendly staff. No complaints.",

This particular location earned 5 stars and we were told by our waitress that there are two other locations in town one being on our side of town even.   The hostess sat us within seconds of stepping inside and I was delighted by the decor. The waiters and waitresses get to wear pajamas which is ADORABLE and they seem so happy like they are enjoying their job. How could you not? Your in jammies!   We ordered Steak and Eggs and coffee in a coffee press but first let me tell you about this bread in a crock the serve first. Holy man....it is all things good in this world. It is baked in this crock or dish served to you warm with cinnamon butter frosting stuff. It is delicious. As if that isn't enough goodness along came our breakfast. The steaks were cooked just as we ordered them and seasoned perfectly with this coffee rub, eggs were spot on and the hash browns crispy. Portions were perfect not overly huge and I left satisfied and not uncomfortably stuffed.   Our server was so pleasant and had time to engage in conversation which was so nice and made us felt welcome. She didn't hover over us and wasn't intrusive she simple was genuinely a happy person I wish I had gotten her name so I could give her a shout out or so you could request her.   They also have a cute section where they sell shirts and other gift shop type items too.   In warmer months they have a nice size patio for outdoor dining that I can't wait to enjoy too.   I highly recommend giving them a try and I know I will be back for sure.",

Little one: ordered juice and something from the kids menu which he enjoyed   Bigger little one: ordered fresh strawberry & watermelon juice (YUM) and the Rise & shine burrito. He loved it although it was a bit spicy - no biggie.   I had a Nutella Latte which was delicious (hard to mess up anything with Nutella) along with the cup o bread which is always on point. I ordered the country fried steak and this is where things started to go down hill. The batter was nice and crunchy as always but for some reason it had a lot of pepper. I mean A LOT!!! But it's ok to have a little spice because the country gravy should offset it right? Wrong. The gravy had a lot of pepper too!!! I'm not sure if the cook had a heavy hand or they just love pepper but I was always told not to over season things because you can add more to it later. The hash browns weren't cooked very well but I'm not a big fan of potatoes anyway so it wasn't a big deal. I continued to finish my plate the most I could before the pepper got to me.   My dad ordered the ham steak, over easy, hash-brown and cup o bread. The only thing he really liked was that cup o bread. The ham steak was dry and the char flavor was over bearing. He didn't care for the hash browns either which he stated should be crispy and not limp.   The service there was great and the server handled the situation with grace and I say this because my father was very disappointed and disgusted with the food so he wasn't kind at all. She came back with the check and took his meal off the bill.   I appreciate the fact that she did that but I think the manager should've came over to find out what was wrong, which nobody did. Which is why I came to yelp so that maybe management will see this review and make changes.",

It comes with a large slab of ham, two eggs, hash browns, and for a bread a choice of a \"cup-o-bread\", toast or biscuit. The ham was on the large side, cooked nicely with grill marks on the meat. The \"Cup-o-Bread\" was a soft cinnamon roll type bread baked in a small cup and was served with a small cup of something similar to the icing found on a cinnamon roll. A filling breakfast.  Service was good. One of the gimmicks here is that many of the servers wore pajamas, nothing bizarre, just regular pjs.",

And the pot o bread was really different and not insanely rich. Definitely coming back.",

The food is spot on and very consistent to taste to the southern highlands location which is great! The portions are huge & delicious. Our server was a little spacey and forgot a couple items we requested or condiments that we had to ask for a second time, but no biggy, it was busy and she did bring them fast on the second request.

The burrito I had zero flavor, I then got the ribeye and eggs which was over cooked, dry, and paper thin. Last I got biscuits and gravy, how can you mess that up. Well they did, again dry and thrown together for 13$ plus you only get two small biscuits not a real meal. My friends went the other day and they said their food was terrible as well. Even when I dined in I watched other tables complain so they gave them \"cow cash\" or whatever it's called. Cool they wear jammies I guess to attract and distract at the same time of how bad the food is. Overpriced food for something that I can make better at home. Save your money, go to ihop even because this food is not worth it.",

The exterior of the place is nice, but the interior is dark and the decor really doesn't mix with the kind of vibe they're trying to create.  Rise & Shine should be bright and cheery.  This place just looks strange inside with it's strange looking upside down umbrellas hanging from the ceiling.  The staff was ok, but were not overly friendly or attentive.   The menu variety does look good and I will be back to order a few other items.  My friend and I both had Build Your Own Omelettes which were great.  Probably the best omelette I've ever had.  The hash browns were beyond disgusting though.  I've never seen hashbrowns like this and I don't know why people insist on putting onions in hashbrowns?!   Potato Salad and hashbrowns do not need onions!   If made right, they stand on their own merit.  The Pot of Bread was good, but it is badly plated and difficult to eat the way it is.  I almost broke the cup trying to get it out.  Overall, it is ok.  I will probably try the one in Southern Highlands next time to see if it is any better from an ambiance and staffing point.",

They have a small seating area inside while you wait but it was already crowded. The decor and atmosphere was bright and fun. Staff was very attentive and friendly from beginning to end.   Now for the food! What an extensive menu! Cold pressed juices? Loco moco? Steak? Eggs? Rice? It has everything an indecisive diner could want! We ordered a chilaquiles, a Belgian waffle with all the fruit, steak and eggs and the red velvet pancakes. Oh my gosh the portions and tastes! Not as obnoxiously big as Hash House but still enough for two meals per plate. Not bad since the average price is $12 per dish. I can honestly say this is the first place I've really liked their scrambled eggs. Not underdone and seems way more than two eggs(but I'll take that!) I wish the pancakes were fluffier. And the pots of breads if you order a la carte seem small for $3+ but it all still tasted great. I also ordered the green apple carrot juice. My bf's dad was having trouble getting refills on his coffee. The server meant well and did everything he could while juggling several other tables. All good. I was happy. I'll definitely be back. Like soon.",

They put together a scramble for the doggies and offered water for them, too.  I had the original pancake - heavenly! Half-order was more than enough; Hubby had the chicken and waffle.  Loved it! Coffee was great, too. Excellent service, delicious food and nice roomy patio for all of us.  We will be back!",

Riiiiight. ******  Let me start by saying that this review will have more to do with management's complete and utter disregard for child safety, and less to do with the food/service, which has always been adequate, but nothing to rave about.  About nine months ago we ate breakfast here and I needed to change my baby's diaper. I put him on the diaper changer and notice it kind of jerked out from the wall and seemed unstable, I finished the diaper change and realize that the four bolts that hold it into the wall were completely stripped and the whole changer was pulling out of the wall. This is obviously completely unsafe, and to me, an emergency, considering that this charger is over 3 feet off the ground, an infant could easily fracture their skull should they fall onto tile from that height. I immediately informed management of the problem, and instead the manager made up a flimsy excuse about teenagers breaking the diaper changer.  About 3 months later we decided to try again, changer was half fixed, the screws in the top had been replaced, but the bottom screws were still pulling out of the wall, I mean, you can literally pull the changer away from the wall, which of course will eventually cause the top screws to pull out again.  I mentioned it to a different manager and she took the opportunity to tell me how awful and crazy the old manager was, instead of just fixing the changer. She did then tell me that it was okay because two of the screws were in. I nicely explained that those changers are supposed to be installed correctly, using all four bolts, so that they are safe, and can hold the weight posted. She ensured me it would be fixed.  Guess what? Three months later, still not fixed. Still pulling out of the wall. Rise and shine complete lack of care for infant and child safety makes me question what other things they do that are less than safe.  We will never, ever be back, as I have given management almost a year to correct this extremely unsafe situation, and unfortunately it's going to take someone's infant getting injured or worse before they take this seriously. If you aren't going to fix it, at least remove the changer all together, instead of risking the safety of every child placed on that changer, whose parent may not notice the loose bolts.  Shame on you rise and shine! I will encourage all my friends and family with small children to avoid your restaurants now, and in the future.",

I am guessing their theme is like being in a \"farm\". There's three different doors you can enter in this place ha! As soon as you enter you'll see these umbrellas with flower print in them, some moves some doesn't. Can you imagine staring at them if everything moves? LOL. Oh and there's a big cow \"poster\" on the wall!  Loco mock - You can't expect this to be 100% good because we all know that's Hawaiian food. I ordered medium well on my patty, it's okay. I also didn't like how much gravy they put, its almost like a soup!!! Not enough rice for how big the patty is and like I said how much gravy is in it! Chocolate milk - A place that uses milk with their powdered cocoa! I hate when places uses water with this!  The register is a step away from the hostess so you have no idea which line unless you ask. But all in all I liked it and I'll give it a second try maybe third :P",

You can tell this place is usually busy because for 2 we were told it was a 25 minute wait, then waited another 20 minutes after being seated to get any service, and the only reason we were was because I had to tell someone otherwise who knows how long we'd be sitting there. If rick is your server, he might not even pay attention to you. The smoothies were pretty good! I got the rib eye steak and eggs which was okay, but pretty salty. My boyfriend got the loco moco which he said was pretty good. Can't say it was good enough to suggest to anyone I know though.",

    "text": "Went there this morning. I had the chicken and waffles, and my friend had the s'mores waffles. We were both blown away. I was given the cinnamon stick infused bottle of maple syrup, and my friend was impressed by the way the Cinnamon Toast Crunch (the graham crackers on her s'mores waffles) were baked into the waffle. The marshmallows were toasted, much to her delight, and the chocolate chips were infused into the batter of the waffle.   My chicken was fried exactly as it should be. No extra grease dripping off of it. The waffle was baked and crispy, I was very impressed. The maple syrup was good, although while infused with real cinnamon stick I couldn't really tell much of a difference.  The waitress we had was excellent, and while not so friendly, was a perfect server. I personally don't want conversation and strangers pretending they're my friends at breakfast, so this was perfect for me, although lonely hearts that need serving staff to be their new buddies will be disheartened. Be wary if you're a Millenial that needs everyone to be approving of their alternate lifestyle and requires everyone to care about it. These people don't, they have a job to accomplish and do it both rapidly and exceptionally.  Five stars for the staff and the food. Kudos to the cooks that I couldn't personally tip and congratulate.",

As I reluctantly got dressed this morning, I will say I had lofty expectations for this restaurant hoping they would fill my belly without leaving my wallet empty.   We arrived around noon on a Saturday and were seated within just a few (maybe 3-5) minutes. What awaited us at the table was a sizeable menu with the everyday breakfast items and a few curious twists. I decided on the bananas foster waffle: a delectable waffle topped with cinnamon, brown sugar bananas, orange zest, whipped cream and a dollop of vanilla ice cream. Now, I know what you must be thinking. Is it breakfast? Is it lunch? Is it a shareable dessert? (Quite possibly all of the above???)  Ten minutes later, I'm staring down this beast only armed with a fork and knife. One bite in, and I'm ready to come back next weekend! This delectable treat is sure to make you reconsider stopping at a Denny's or IHOP ever again! The combo with scrambled eggs and crispy bacon (how I requested it cooked) were absolute perfection. This was worth waking up for, and I'm so thankful this place exists a mere seven minute drive from my house!!!  Congratulations Rise & Shine for making another customer for life!",

That's our own fault though for deciding to wait. It was a beautiful day and patio was closed. A lot of empty tables inside.   Food was good and presentation of the food was nice. Sadly, for all the time waiting, I was kind of just ready to move on with my day at that point.   On the check, the server wrote in what 18% percent gratuity would be and added it in and circled the total with the 18%. Kind of tacky.   Long story short, food was good but not that good.",

I was a little nervous about being the only customers outside, as most places forget about you, but that was not the case. They were very attentive and the food was amazing.

The breakfast menu is far from basic they have several different ways to cook eggs Benedict plus unique pancakes that I've have never seen on another menu. My son had the chocolate chip red velvet pancake with a cream cheese like sauce. First of all it was huge!!! One pancake was larger than the plate. For a sweet breakfast it was very good and fluffy. I had the Belgian waffle with strawberries and whipped cream and totally enjoyed it. The waffle was crisp but fluffy at the same time and was loaded with strawberries and whipped cream. The coffee was piping hot and plentiful.  Service was good the wait was super friendly and made sure everyone liked their meal. The prices were a little high but you get a ton of food.",

Our server Sarah apologized for the delay. We arrived for breakfast shortly after a group of 14, hence the volume seemed to over whelm the kitchen with a long wait time for our breakfast order.  The order of Pancakes was delicious and consisted of 2 hubcap size cakes. Too much for the average person. The Chilaquiles had an over abundance of spicy ranchero chips and a little short on the refried beans. We received the bill and were told to take our time. I put my credit on it and waited for our server to pick it up. After a lengthy wait I waived at Sarah and she advised us to pay at the register.",

    "text": "I really really wanted to like this place. It's a shame we spent over $60 to be disappointed. My boyfriend and I love steak and eggs and always said we will eventually try this place out. So, Saturday around 1pm today we walked in an almost empty restaurant. The atmosphere was great, our seats were perfect, the music was comfortable and it just seemed like it was gonna be a good experience. After all, how can you fuck up breakfast?   Anyways, we ordered and to start off. the coffee was room temp, and the container that the creamer came in had a black muck in it. Clearly it was dirty and reused without washing. But sure, restaurants make mistakes and things happen so we were willing to let that one go. But I guess our brunch wasn't over yet because after this one mistake after another kept happening. Second was my smoothie. I saw it sitting on the counter after being finished for a good 10-15 min before it was brought to our table, its weird because you'd think \"fresh\" smoothies should be delivered as soon as possible. And when the smoothie was delivered she refilled my water, but when I looked down to drink there was some kind of dirt that fell in the water. But whatever, I'll drink from his cup instead..   food comes out and our steak was waaay underdone. The hash browns were burnt and oily and the eggs were over cooked.  Unfortunately we couldn't eat it and had to send it back. This was minutes after trying to flag the server down. Through all this our food remains sitting in front of us uneaten and getting colder. when she finally notices we were trying to get her attention she tells us that she thought we had asked for medium rare. She said they'll throw the steak back on the grill. And to order the hash browns less crispy next time. We thought it was weird that they would throw the same piece of steak that we already tried to eat back on their grill. but I guess she wasn't kidding lol. So then it came out the second time and it was dry and overdone with my omelette that was more rubbery the second time it came out because it was the same eggs that came with our meal. I guess they thought why would you re do the omelette if we only complained about the steak and the hash browns, right???? well, it's so the cheese doesn't solidify by the time it comes out and so the eggs don't turn out rubbery that's why! It's either they're lazy or just don't wanna use their resources properly. As for the hash browns they came out soggy and much greasier. over all, the food tasted like left overs when it was time to eat it.   the second time the server comes back to check on how we were liking our food I was just fed up from how sloppy this place has been so I said mine was fine. My boyfriend told her he didn't like his at all but he and I were both hungry so we'll eat it.   At this point honestly, what can you do? She tried  to give him a $5 coupon for the next time we come back but I don't think we will be coming back. Terrible impression overall.   We still left her a 20% tip though because we're not terrible people. We just really wanted a good breakfast dammit! lol",

There is a nice outdoor area that also has kids play zone and games for our little one. Big bonus as she was bored post food. I ordered the eggs Benedict (normal) and did poached hard eggs. I should have done normal as my mom and wife's eggs were poached perfect (I dislike the runny egg white). The taste was still good and serving size was nice (too much for most, perfect for me). I ordered crispy hash browns and they were done very well. Wife had the salmon eggs Benedict and she liked hers. She didn't like mine as much and I think it's because they did a drizzle of balsamic vinegar over the hollandays sauce. I would definitely go here again. I also found it nice being off strip and away from everything.   Also daughter got the half waffle and came with whipped cream. I finished that. Real maple syrup and had cinnamon sticks innit even though I could not taste it. The waffle was good and fluffy and the syrup soaked in nicely even after being cold I found it very good.",

I understand though that all of their managers were out of town for a training conference, so that this could what contributed to the food only being a 3. I give our server, Devyn, 5 stars though. We moved here from Chicago 9 months ago and have been consistently disappointed with the hospitality we've experienced here in Las Vegas. Thanks to Devyn that experience is starting to change. She is a competent, caring, attentive, and efficient server. She is a gem with a gift of hospitality. Thank you Devyn!",

Literally not a seat in the house. The staff still managed to seat us promptly and deliver our food in less time than I've waited at some Chipotle's. They were even apologetic about both the wait to be seated and the wait for food, which really wasn't long compared so other popular breakfast joints in town.  I'm a big fan of their fresh pressed juice, especially the strawberry watermelon one. TRY IT! I tend to do breakfast a bit on the healthy side, so I'm always the one ordering the egg white omelette with all sorts of substitutions. Even so, their hash browns are THE BEST. They slice the potatoes nice and thin so that they come out crispy...hopefully the way everyone likes them. That's how I like them! No soggy or greasy hash browns here!  Each time I've come in the staff has been dressed up, once for Halloween and once they were all wearing pajamas. It def gives a different vibe to your weekend breakfast routine. I love it!",

I don't remember the name of the waffle I got but it was basically a smores waffle with cinnamon toast crunch on it, delicious even though they didn't bring it out with syrup and took forever to actually get it and start eating. Steak was cooked perfectly, just how I asked. I asked for over medium eggs and received fully cooked fried eggs. I really wanted my steak with some yolk. For the waffle dish we asked for over medium eggs and sausage, we received scrambled eggs and bacon. That error is hard to over look because it is in no way similar to what we ordered. Paid $35 for those two meals and it definitely was not worth it in my opinion. The steak and eggs were a good portion for the price but definitely not the waffle. Probably won't be coming back.",

    "text": "We walked in and were told the wait would be about 10-20 mins, no problem, we looked around and read some of the funny quotes on the t-shirts , some very comical, we enjoyed the cute flower umbrellas hanging from the ceiling, seemed cozy and we were eager to see how the food was going to be.  We actually were seated only 10 mins of waiting, nice surprise and were sat near the fresh juice drink bar, and had to order the Watermelon juice and a fresh squeezed orange juice , yes the watermelon was fresh and not imitation, it was so refreshingly delicious, and pretty much the most flavorful item I ordered.  We came during Halloween weekend and all the staff were dressed in costumes which added to the fun environment... \"Harry Potter\" served us and he was great and knew the menu very well.  The unfortunate reason for the 3 stars was the food, although looking good, we found for some reason the eggs were a little rubbery and we had to keep adding salt... As per recommendation of \"Harry\" as to get either the Banger sausage, the kielbasa or bacon, he raved about the bacon especially if ordered extra crispy...  So I ordered the classic which included 2 eggs, bacon (extra crispy) and hash browns with choice of bread and of course the cinnamon pot of bread (you must try the pot of bread if you dine here a positive plug and reward for the meal).  When the meal arrived, the bacon was barely past pink and did not stand up to attention by any means, sad... I was only able to eat a few bites of the eggs , and no it wasn't a picky morning, just an unfortunate meal for me. My friends got a classic with 3 egg whites and one yolk, avocado and hash browns, she also had the same problem with her eggs being rubbery and tasting like they came from a carton not a fresh egg. And chicken fried steak and gravy  The hash browns were almost done well enough, a bit of bite it took to eat and the steak my friend said was dry but edible.  I think something must have been wrong with the coffee machine because it tasted burnt but was cold...  So to sum up, we might give it another shot and try completely different meals but will make sure to order the watermelon juice and pot of bread for sure. We left feeling underwhelmed and still hungry.",

Lol anywho food, we got the chilaquiles, spice rubbed rib eye chilaquiles, country fried steak and eggs, and my little one had the silver dollar cakes. All of it was delicious, the little one finished his plate and was eating out of mine! The spice rubbed rib eye was amazing, i had it medium well and the flavor of the spices, juices from the meat wow!! Chilaquiles were very enjoyable with some sour cream, chees was there and even had beans on the bottom so mix well!! Eggs were ever easy so it all came together in great unity for an epic breakfast!

It's not a $5-6 steak and egg that you can get as a late night special, but you pay for better quality and things you can't get elsewhere.   One of their highlights I would say is their pot of bread. It's almost like a cinnamon roll, and especially when you dip it into their cream cheese icing (or whatever the deliciousness is), it takes just like one. Since they have a full breakfast menu, you can get a variety of items. One of my favorites are the chilaquiles with the ribeye steak. Unfortunately it doesn't come with the pot of bread, but you could always get it on the side, it's worth it! The servers all wear pajamas, so I guess it fits into the theme of Rise and Shine, and I think it's pretty cool. Definitely worth the visit!",

    "text": "A couple of friends brought my daughter here for breakfast after a sleepover recently & when she got home, she was ranting & raving about how we needed to go back. She thought I would love it. I decided to give it a shot today since I was in the area...I can see why she recommended it.  It's a cute place that is spacious, the decor is happy, the people are all pleasant (who wouldn't be happy wearing pj's at work?!) & then the food...it's really good.  This morning I ordered:  -latte w/Nutella & whipped cream -build your own omelette (I chose cheddar, spinach & avocado w/ the pot of bread as my side choice) -strawberry watermelon juice  The latte was ok. Tasted more like a hot cocoa & wasn't hot enough for me. I felt like I had to drink it quick so I wouldn't lose the heat. Next time I'll opt for the French press coffee.  The omelette was pretty darn good. The egg portion was fluffy & the ingredients I added were fresh & tasty. My favorite part of the plate? The hash browns. Holy cow were those good. They are thick cut strips of real potatoes that were the perfect combo of crispy & seasoned with some softer pieces underneath. I want to high five the chef for the perfect grilling of this deliciousness on my plate. The pot of bread that I chose was amazing too. It came out hot with a side of butter and cream cheese sauce. When I removed the bread from the pot, I found that there were swirls of cinnamon throughout it. I dipped it in the cream cheese & to my delight, I realized it was like a cinnamon roll. So so good.  The waiter recommended their fresh squeezed juices that are squeezed fresh on site. I decided I wanted something else after the quick latte so I ordered the strawberry watermelon juice. It was ok. Definitely fresh. The flavor was more watermelon than strawberry & it was sweet but had a bit of a bitter aftertaste like I had just bitten into the white/green part of the melon. I think I'll try a different flavor next time.  The service was good. I had a waiter named Roy who was patient & friendly. He was as quick as he could be.   Overall I'm happy with the experience & will definitely come back!",

    "text": "What is not to love about rise & shine, my husband and I came in on a Sunday morning before church at 9am. No wait, no line, no problems.  We were greeted by a beautiful hostess who had us promptly seated and minutes later we were greeted by our sweet and fun waitress in blue pajamas with white lining on the arms and the ends of her bottoms. (I wish I remembered her name we tipped her extra because she was perfect.) anywho, she got us drinks immediately and helped us to decipher some things on the menu. We went with the pot of bread for each of us. HELLO, so good?!? And my husband had the Italian iced coffee.   we came with our 5 month old, they didn't have a sling or highchair for her carseat but she slept the entire time and they put her carseat in a chair, we kind of wish she woke up just so she could see the beautiful umbrellas on the ceiling.   For our entrees I had chicken and waffles - well seasoned, slightly spicy, too much breading but so delicious... and my husband had the ultimate steak and eggs, he was so wowed by the flavor of everything on his plate he asked if we could come back with our whole family for Father's Day.   We asked to book a table a whole month in advance for Father's Day and were told that Sunday mornings we probably shouldn't have a problem but to call ahead to get a time estimate, the manager was awesome and so was our hostess.   Now here comes the con. - I won't mark the restaurant 4 stars just because the cashier ruined my morning so...  We rated our visit a 15 until it was time to checkout. We approached the check out and had to check out with the woman in the front... She was happy to take my money but angry and pissed to take my virtual stamp card. As a matter of fact, she wanted me to step to the side and figure out how to make it work while she checked other people out and then when I did she gave me credit for one thing when essentially I was owed credit for the coffee, and both entrees. Makes me sad that on every table they hype up the app and if everyone gets that same push back j don't care how beautiful your establishment is, how great your food is, and how amazing your management and waitress staff is, the cashier needs an attitude adjustment. She set a bad tone for my Sunday, which was also my birthday weekend. Let her know we appreciate what help we got. So be warned, unless you've used \"epoxy\" the app before, don't ask questions when you check out.",

    "text": "First off, food is always a 5 star. Service however is usually a 2 at best. This Sunday, I actually had a good server, which Is why I waited to do a review. I wanted to request to no be sat in a certain persons section since the last 3 times I have gone here, I've sat in his section. I got a new guy this time and wish I remembered his name. He was attentive and did his job properly and they were moderately busy.   The \"other\" server, in the past has been outright rude. Not the best way to start a morning. We sat outside, waited about 10 minutes to be greeted by our server. By then we were ready to order food and our drinks. While I was giving my food order, he was texting on his phone and missed my order. I had to do I again, then the meal was wrong. I got a rude look as he took my plate back instead of just fixing the one wrong item. So I sat with no food for about 10-15 minutes while the amazing cooks replaced the meal.   The next time I had this server, it was barely busy, but apparently 2 servers called in sick, it was a holiday weekend. Waited over 45 minutes for our food, this same server never came to the table to fill drinks or explain. I walked to the kitchen to get my own coffee where he grabbed the cups from my hands to fill it. Also, greeted with an attitude. When I was asked by the manager how my meal was, I said \"food was great, service and server were terrible. \" she replied simply \"oh\".  I think the service here needs to be put on attention. If you're not a morning person, a breakfast restaurant might not be a great career choice franky.",

On the other hand, the menu is a bit busy and doesn't really lead me to any particular area of the menu to order. For a place with \"steak\" in the name I was expecting more \"steak\" entrees. Service was a bit slow given that the place wasn't that busy. Staff were also not the friendliest, but not the worst I've experienced.  As for the food, it was ok. My steak was cooked to how I ordered it, although it was bland. I somehow feel like Denny's is a step above this place. There was nothing that wowed me about the food. Service improved towards the end. My coffee was refilled before dropping below half. Overall this place is okay. Would I necessarily return here again? No, but if the only choice was between here and McDonald's for breakfast, I'd probably go here instead.",

The outdoor patio is pet friendly, which is both good and bad. Although I would love to bring my furry friends, I could do without the pet hair blowing around my eggs.  We ordered an iced coffee for $4, which we won't order again. Received the coffee to find out it was coffee, chocolate syrup, and nesquick powder and a ton of ice. Would have been good except they didn't stir the powder and with the shape of the glass and amount of ice they used, it makes it almost impossible to stir, so you get big globs of powder.  We ordered the bacon wrapped steak and two egg breakfast. We also got a pot of bread which was delicious.  Generous portion of bacon and good potatoes. Potatoes could use a bit more salt though...  Great venue overall..nice space between tables. Two people for breakfast cost about $40.  We would go back again.",

Kiddo had the silver dollar pancakes.. to which he said, \"they are almost as good as yours\"  Overall, great experience! Stuffed to the max! I'd like to make one small note.... the lady in the back with the gorgeous red hair flowing.. should tie it back. Also, she should refrain from grabbing her phone and iPads with the same gloves she's handling all the food with. Sorry.. I had to throw that part in there  That's the only reason for my 4 stars.

I am glad I did, fortunately it was not packed yet so my first visit quite calm. A lot of that is due to the relaxed atmosphere, but still the customer is priority. I got sat facing the open kitchen which for me ( picky about the way the food is handled & who is preparing it ) was not off putting. The fun thing is that the servers wear pajamas. Pricing is consistent with similar restaurants, but the food I think was quite a bit better. Asked for my steak well done and unlike a lot of well done steaks I have received this one had a great char on the outside but was still tender enough on the outside ( no hockey puck here ). Service was excellent from the hostess all the way through and including bus help. I highly recommend coming here and this will now be my go to breakfast place.",

Waited over 25 minutes for our food and I noticed some people who were seated after us go their food before us, but the fancy omelette made up for it. It comes with a steak the size of your palm, hash browns and biscuit. Delicious! Sisters liked the red velvet pancakes but the ham steak was not good. Overall cute place with big portions and outdoor seating. Friendly, but slow service. I recommend just ordering take out.",

Instantly fell in love with this place. The ambience is super cute and the employees all seem upbeat and in a good mood. We waited for about 15 minutes for a table on a Saturday morning.  First things first - they were ON TOP of the coffee game, yo. I rarely had to wait for a coffee refill, it just kept coming around.  My second fave thing about my experience, was that I told my server about my \"dilemma\" - that I really wanted a steak but that I REALLY wanted an omelet too (fat kid probs) and she said oh yeah, just order the steak and eggs, and we can make the eggs into an omelet for ya, and you can just pay 50 cents per each veggie you want to add. Wow! Super awesome. So it stands, I had a steak cooked medium with a 3-egg omelet with veggies. It also came with a side of toast, and of course, potatoes. This place is the real deal, I fell in love with it and will be back soon! :)",

    "text": "This place sucks. I usually dont complain about food but i came here and had about 3 bites of food.   I ordered chilaquiles which is a dish i have prepared before. It contains chile sauce and is usually seved with sour cream on the side or on top with fried eggs and beans.   On the menu it says that it is served with refried beans, sauce, cheddar cheese, sour cream, salsa, and two eggs.  What i got was basically nachos chips with NO sauce and beans under all the chips and when i asked for a little bit of sauce they took my plate and re did the whole thing which was nice of them. But when i got my plate back the plate was drenched in an exaggerated amount of sauce. It literally spilled off my plate as i put my fork in it..  And they forgot the beans.   So i asked for a side of beans and i was so over the fact that i couldnt eat my food without spilling sauce everywhere.   So i had about 3 bites before i pushed my plate away and just asked them to take it back. At that point i wasnt going to have them bring back a third plate.   The manager was nice enough to take it off out bill but gave zero fucks that it even happened. But at least out server was nice.  I would never come here again. My boyfriends food turned out the way it was supposed to. But we both agreed that the food was just \"okay\"",

Each time I have come here, all waiters and waitresses are always attentive, and sometimes I want to ask them what they are on because I'm a tired mom of a toddler.   Usually when I dine out with my kid, it's always a hit or miss. You can kind of tell if the service team is new, doesn't, have kids, or doesn't want to deal with them. At the end of my meal I can tell they are very familiar with toddler age patrons. For one thing, they brought out his food/drink immediately.   So why the 4 stars? To be honest, it's the food. I feel that their menu really isn't special. Pancakes were salty and reminded me of out if the box taste. Our table also ordered a couple of French press coffee. I think their French press was either broken or not put together correctly because the coffee grounds were pouring out with the coffee. I came in late, so it wasn't worth it to mention to the waitress ( the group I was with, really don't complain about coffee).  It's like they are the Cheesecake Factory of breakfast restaurants. Pricey, huge amount of average food, good service.",

Definitely was sort of like a cinnamon roll with yummy cream cheese frosting on side so you can control how much you want. I liked the fact that they offer freshly squeezed juices in carafes if you're in a large party. We ordered the green go go juice carafe and it was enough for 3 of us. It was on the sweet side, I'm guessing due to the honeydew but I enjoyed it.   3/5 for the chicken & waffles. I'm not a huge fan of salty things... and most of the time, restaurants over season their dishes IMO (like metro diner's chicken & waffles) but the chicken here was definitely lacking some flavor! It was super juicy and the waffle tasted amazing with the warm syrup they offered but it was on the bland side. I would probably order just waffles next time.   2/5 chilaquiles was a big portion but again, lacked flavor. My sister said it needed more sauce. The meat was very tender though. She didn't end up finishing more than 1/3 of her order.  Looks like pancakes, waffles and their juices are the way to go but I'll try a steak & egg dish next time.",

If you are looking for a great breakfast spot in Summerlin, this is it.  Food is great and MOST of the staff are awesome.  3/7/19 We have been going to this location since we moved to Summerlin.  A few of the wait staff deserve 5 stars.  Yesterday we had a server who was TERRIBLE! He had a table next to ours that were his regulars.  This guy was bending over backwards for them, hot cups of coffee rather then filling from the pitcher, birthday pancake bs, coddling them, practically wiping their faces.  Food took over 30 minutes to come out, sure they were busy but the section next to his all got their food even if sat after us, WAY before we got ours.  He got 3 our of 4 of our dishes wrong, didn't even bother to check on us for awhile after.  My food was ice cold, and looked like he forgot to order what I had asked for (which he did mess up anyway) and just had the kitchen throw some dry diced chicken on someone else's order. When I said my food was cold he seemed put out and said he could replace it.  After sitting for over an hour, with two small children, there was no way I was going to wait for this dude to get another one made.  All the while overly waiting on the table next to us, I am not exaggerating.  He ignored and gave ALL his other tables lousy service to he could kiss butt to his regulars.   He then gives us two $5 coupons that can only be used during the week (we were there on a Saturday since we work during the week and don't usually go there other then weekends) and still gets our bill wrong by adding extra items.  His fake smile is really what set me off on the whole thing.  His gushing of the other table then the dead eyes and condescending tone was too much for me.  I wish I would have gotten his name because it was ridiculous.",

The server was pleasant and prompt with refills.  We had the steak & chilaquilles, the salmon, bacon bagel sandwich, and the french toast.  All were outstanding, although the steak had a bit of gristle.  The only small complaint we had was that it did take quite a while to receive our orders.  The table next to us got their food much more rapidly.  I recommend this spot.",

This place has some of the largest portions of food I've seen yet. As far as breakfast goes, I only know of one other place that comes close. You need to come to this restaurant prepared for a feast. It surely won't disappoint.   My boyfriend and I came here hungry on a Sunday. We had never been. There was many people waiting in the lobby area. It took us maybe 20-30 minutes to get seated during mid-morning rush hours. They seemed like they were able to accommodate large parties. So, that's good to know.   Our server was dressed in a llama pajama outfit. It was AWESOME. She was friendly and attentive, even though they were very busy. She made recommendations about her favorite food. My only slight annoyance was that she didn't tell us that we were ordering WAY, WAY too much food. However, that's still okay. It was worth trying all of it.  We ordered the Country Friend New York Steak & Eggs, Buffalo-Style Crispy Chicken Breasts & Eggs, and Banana Frosted Flake Pancakes. For two of us.   All of it was fantastic. Again, if I have not made it clear enough, the portions were massively colossal to epic proportions. Yes, too much food. It was all very tasty though. We didn't want to stop eating, even though there was no dent made in the food. Hashtag, leftovers...  Overall, super awesome breakfast joint. The only possible set back is that it did take awhile to get our food once ordered. I would say 20-30 minutes, but if you're not in a rush, it is definitely worth the wait. Super happy customer here! And, again, HUGE portions. Don't be afraid to share.",

One of the best breakfast places ever. Their coffee is amazing . I got the hazelnut Nutella coffee and it was delicious, just the right amount of sweetness . The meal portions are very large. I got the NY steak spinach egg Benedict. It was delicious! I had my steak medium rare and it was  very tender and juicy. Just high quality meat on top of a yummy bagel. The cup 'o bread is also a must have! I loved how soft the bread was and the dipping sauce is just perfect.   I was pleased with the service . Also I love their merch ! It's so adorable and funny  .

Well lets start with one dish where the sweet was too sweet (my sons dish) and the savory had no flavor. The next dish had no seasoning and the third dish (chicken and waffles) had an abundance of batter,  so thick I was able to peel it off and there was a chunk of batter that was larger than a McDonald's chicken nugget.  The chicken breast that was under all that batter had absolutely NO taste (once again, no flavor)  Needless to say, it was not edible.   So unfortunate because I was looking forward to it since it's my favorite dish at their other location in Southern Highlands.  The upside is that they did acknowledge that I didn't eat my meal but because my husband had already paid the bill, the manager gave me a whopping $5 gift certificate for the incontinence of my $15 dish.",

    "text": "We gave this place a shot again because we have family in town and wanted to go somewhere close.  Of course we were met with disappointment and embarrassment again.  My big takeaway is that employees are not empowered enough to make decisions and make things right for the customer.  Owner is not there to discuss policy and manager is also not there, and no one can make a decisions other than the two people not there.  I invited my family to breakfast because I have a few $50 gift cards, and I wanted to treat them after a long flight.  There's no notice anywhere that they can't accept multiple gift cards.  I go to pay a $158 bill... I had 3 gift cards, one with $3.59 in it and two with $50 that I was expecting to significantly defray my cost.  However, cashier tells me they can't accept more than 2 forms of payment.  I start offering solutions... can you split the check and do two forms per check? \"No\", can you void the order and ring it up in two checks? \"No owner doesn't allow it\".  Is owner here to discuss? \"No\", can I speak to a manager? \"Manager is not here\", so everything is no? \"Unfortunately\" and there's no one to talk to about it? \"Unfortunately no\".  Can you attempt to run the cards and see if it will work? \"Unfortunately no\".  It was so frustrating and embarrassing since I had told my family I would cover.  I have perfectly good payment forms and the restaurant has no way to accept them.  They should have some upfront notice that they can't accept gift cards.  This is a huge issue if you plan to pay a certain way and are not permitted.  Ownership and management should find a way to empower their employees to make decisions and fix things when they are not around.   What a terrible experience, when I was trying to give this place another chance after a year of avoiding it given the way we were treated last time.  My family was so excited during breakfast only to them have them all feel terrible when we left.  Awful experience.  *** edited to say the below response from management is incorrect, you did NOT allow three forms of payment from me.  Check your records.  I was only able to use one of my 3 gift cards and the rest had to be put on my personal card.  I'm happy to go back with my receipt so you can see.  No one was empowered to make any exceptions in this case, even though we were not splitting the check between multiple people... it is just gift cards.  Something I should've been able to use whether I was a party of 1 or 20.",

I learned immediately that there was no wi-fi network available, which I find slightly ridiculous in 2018. I had my meal which was pretty boring and fairly tasteless. Upon finishing my meal, I needed to leave and asked the waitress for my part of the check to be split off so I could pay. She refused, and told me the machine could only split the check two ways (there was 6 of us). Now, I'm no genius here... But I do understand point of sale systems and I do know that they can run multiple transactions and split checks many different ways. This was merely her not wanting to do it, or restaurant policy. Either way it's pretty ridiculous. Suffice to say I won't be returning to this location.",

We had Chelsea as our server and service was great!  I called ahead to verify wait time and if we could bring our Frenchie. For a 70 degree Saturday morning, there was no wait for patio seating. If you do bring a pup, I recommend bringing a caribiner to hook their leash to one of the wooden poles- especially if your dog is an explorer like mine. There's also an Astro turfed area where I am assuming you can \"walk\" your dog although I wouldn't since it is so close to dining. I also fed my dog the orange garnishes that came on the plates.  We will definitely be back!!!",

And the fresh baked cup of bread is always good. Did I mention the food is amazing?! And I love how everyone wears pajamas. That is such a cool touch.",

Now the cons.  The eggs were overcooked on my benedict.  I am not a breakfast snob, but I do expect a breakfast restaurant to be able to properly cook eggs.  My husband ordered a specialty frozen/iced coffee drink, which was the worst frozen coffee ever.  Tasted like watered down hot chocolate.  No flavor.  Our server was very nice but was slow, and the check was wrong.  But the worst of it was paying.  You have to pay at the register, and we waited 20 minutes in line just to pay our check (there were only 2 parties paying ahead of us).  Not sure why it took so long, but it definitely sealed the deal on our decision never to return.  Worst dining experience in a long time.  I only gave it 2 stars because the staff was very friendly.",

These waffles are so light they melt in your mouth, but crisp on the edges like waffle cones. It all might sound too sweet but the banana can pull it back a little in each bite, so I don't feel too much like I'm having dessert for breakfast.. So awesome!",

Never going back to this location. The one at Southern Highlands is wayyyyy better!",

However, based on the size of the portions versus the price charged, I feel that they were a little on the pricey side. Would I come back?  Definitely.

Although it will admit the previous reviews made me a little nervous about the wait.   We came at about 10 am on a Friday and we were seated right away. We got coffee and fresh squeezed orange juice. I thought the juice bar was a great touch! I ordered the ultimate steak & eggs w/ pot o bread and it was divine! I ordered my steak medium rare and it was closer to medium but I didn't mind. And the pot o bread was yummy and very fluffy. The hash browns and eggs were just as delicious. Definitely a little bigger portion size so be prepared to leave full! Overall I really enjoyed the whole experience and I can't wait to come back! Especially since it's so close!",

My boyfriend and I both ordered the ribeye steak and eggs and it was so good.  Our dishes came with hashbrown and also a choice of bread.  One of the bread options is bread in a cup, which is pretty much a cinnamon roll in a cup.  It was unique, soft, and hot.  If you like cinnamon rolls you should probably choose that as your choice of bread.  The ambiance had a bit of a whimisical feel.  There were spinning umbrellas, and the colors in the restaurant were vibrant.  They also sell silly socks and reataurant apparel and items at the front counter.  The servers also wear pajamas.  A little silly but suits the restaurant.",

I thought the wait staff wearing jammies was so cute. Our waitress was Sammy and she was so great! My hubby had the waffle platter and loved it, my daughter had the little pancake meal and gobbled up the pancakes which is rare for her. I tasted both the waffle and the pancakes and they were so delicious! I had the carne asada chillaquilles and they were really good and a little spicy. I'm more of a sweet breakfast person so I should have gone with something more of a French toast or waffle. We saw someone order the red velvet pancakes and when they came out, they were huge!! Looked amazing though.  We will definitely be back to try some of the different things!",

Waffles were extra crispy and hard. Same with the biscuits even though they were covered in gravy. Every meal was completely cold. No refills on drinks and just about the worst service I think I've had in a long time. The manager knew we were upset and didn't say a word. Horrible place! And extremely over priced. $87 for 3 adults and a child. Never again!",

    "text": "Rise and Shine is right next to the LVAC Summerlin on Flamingo Road and Hwy 215, I have heard stories about the steak specials for breakfast in this place for months since they turned to old Crab Shack into this steak restaurant - The key word is steak - The steak was grilled to perfection combined with fresh leaves of spinach mixed with the Hollandaise covered on a seed bagel with drilled golden Hollandaise Sauce over the bagel, hash brown potatoes, the grilled dish was spectacular. The atmosphere is gorgeous inside, large, high ceilings, colorful, and at 655 AM in this morning before Christmas Eve, there was not only four customers waiting for the doors to open with me, but folks coming into the restaurant to order breakfast to take home to their families. The chef had this special baked \"bread in a cup\" with cinnamon that my son adored. We had so much food left over between the two of us that we took our breakfast home for lunch and let me remind you, this was the first meal of the day, when my son eats, but he still couldn't finish all the steak and bagels that came with the extra large giant plate. The service was excellent. In the far corner were baskets of fruit where the waitress squeezed fresh juices for the Las Vegas Athletic Club fans eating after their yoga aerobic classes. These body builders want the best after lifting. The place is a class act for athletes, families, and groups ready to enjoy the day by starting the morning with steak for breakfast. The stories are True, this is the best place to have breakfast in Las Vegas, Nevada.",

When we finally found the door, we were promptly greeted and seated at a nice booth.  Portions are huge. I had the corned beef hash and scrambled eggs. The hash had a good flavor but over fried and greasy. The bread in a pot was a nice touch. My partner had eggs over easy, perfectly prepared, and bangers. They were very tasty, I would order them next time. The server was very nice, she answered all our questions and checked back to see if we needed anything. All in all, it was a good experience.

The portions are large I took enough home for two more meals for my daughter and I. Prices are reasonable so Jerry and Rise and Shine get 5 stars.

I made my first visit to your business on 12/17 around noon.  I'd like to compliment you on what you've put together - Joe's Crab Shack never looked better!  Hostess was prompt.  Server (Ashley) was an A+ - I'm a bit hard of hearing and she was very patient and helpful with me. I never felt unattended or rushed to get \"the table turned\". She's a keeper!!  Rib-eye, eggs, hash-browns - also an A+ - I really don't know how I could suggest any improvements to them.  Water - I choose to drink water with my meals and yours was a real disappointment compared to other restaurants in the area (Fuddruckers, Roadhouse, Famous Daves, etc). It just tasted \"off with a metal flavor\" Let's go with a D on this one.  Sourdough Toast - I guess I'd give it a C... but compared to rest of the meal it was a distraction.  Price / Value - Let's go with a B on this one.... as a consumer I'd have been blown away had it only been $10.95 (not that I suggest this is reasonable!) and I would have been disappointed had it been $18.95. Your current pricing will encourage me to return and bring others with me.  I know this is extreme feedback. I hope you find it helpful. I know how hard staying profitable, retaining great staff, and attracting a loyal customer base can be.",

The sauce was just a runny watery, tasteless, liquid flooding the bottom of the dishes making the English muffins soggy. To make things worse they drizzled the whole dish with a Balsamic Vinegar that overpowered the taste of everything. Balsamic doesn't belong on top of your eggs - yuck.  My husbands Rib Eye steak was so tough he couldn't eat it. We also ordered the pancakes that were so thick they were dry to eat and still doughy in the middle. No matter how much syrup or butter you put on them it didn't help. Never eat there again - lesson learned",

    "text": "Two months ago this was one of my favorite places for breakfast but like typical Vegas, service and quality are gone.  Before we ordered we asked the waitress if we could split the bill between 5 of us.  She said the menu said it could only be split by two but since we told her early enough she could do it.  She put it all on one bill.  Two of us ordered the Nutella Cappuccinos which are $4+.  The waitress came by to offer us refills of regular coffee; she filled my cup up half way.  What she didn't tell us was that there was an additional $2.95 charge for the refill, two months ago, there was not. I ordered a Loco Mocco, it was terrible.  So salty, the eggs were under cooked and the burger was burned (I ordered medium).  When we checked out, the girl at the counter asked how it was. As we started telling her about the coffee charge she really didn't want to hear it so she walked away and asked someone else to deal with us.  We explained the coffee refill and service issues with her but she just wanted to argue saying that it's the owner's rules to charge for refills.  Again, I explained we were offered refills but never told we would be charged for them.  If this is policy, you should at least let the guest know.  A simple \"I'm sorry\" was all we needed.  She offered to take off the charge for the coffee but again let us know it was their policy.  She missed the whole point, we told her we would never come back but at this point she didn't want to listen, she told us we could just leave, there was no charge.  We weren't complaining to get free food; we were trying to let them know they had a customer service issue they needed to fix.  Needless to say, we won't be back.",

    "text": "Rise & Shine is well worth the wait....while I understand it's not fun or what alot of people enjoy doing is waiting for a bit, it's part of the whole process if you want a great breakfast place. That says a whole lot about the establishment....it must be good food and greatly staffed. So my fav is the Chicken n Waffles, it's by far the best in town!! 2nd in line is the Spice Rubbed Rib Eye Steak Chilaquiles, it amazingly hits my palette in every way possible and never lets me down! 3rd choice would have to be my honey's fav, the New York Steak Spinach & Benedict Bagel, he can't go to this place without ordering this plate every time, it makes your tummy smile. The plates I've just mentioned are all crowd pleaders, decisions, decisions!! So my recommendation is to you I would definitely come in and checkout this breakfast joint out, even if it's for the Belgian Waffles, they won't ever come out cold. This place is all made to order. So if you are looking for a fast food place this thankfully is not a fly by the seat of your pants, kind of thing! It's a very warm and cozy spot that you can hang with all your BFF's and loved ones. I hope you enjoy it as much as I do. My friends and family just love this place. I would recommend this place to just about anyone for some, \"yummy to my tummy\" food!!! Enjoy.......",

    "text": "I should start this review by stating the Rise N Shine WAS one of my favorite places to eat. The food WAS great and the staff WAS amazing. This time was much different. My parents and I decided to enjoy this beautiful fall day and have a great lunch outside. When we arrive at the flamingo and 215 location, we were informed the outside was closed to clean. We informed the hostess we were going somewhere else to eat outside and it was only then that she reluctantly stated \"if that is what it takes to get you to stay, you can eat the outside\".  We were seated outside and our server Corey attempted to take great care of us. My mother and I both ordered the patty melt which was spot on in the past but not today. My father ordered the corned beef hash which also was usually great. After waiting an inordinate amount of time, which we would allow for perfect food, we received our orders. My mom and I fought our way through half of our patty melts.  The reason it was such a fight was do to the unbelievably salty over seasoning. When we informed our server, he said that since we ate half he would see what he could do. He came back and said he would give us a 15% family and friends discount. That was better than nothing but not appropriate. No manager came to speak with us even though I know that is the way any restaurant should respond to complaints. We do not fault our server because we know he was trying his best under less than ideal conditions. My father who white knuckled his way through his corned beef hash exclaimed after the fact mentioned his meal was way too greasy and below standards. I am sad to say that we will not be dining at Rise N Shine again unless they can repair their now broken systems. Please fix it so I can return.",

We had about a 15 minute wait, which isn't bad for a breakfast place at 930 in the morning. We were seated and our waiter brought menus and took our drink orders quickly. The Orange juice is fresh squeezed and tasted amazing. The downside is that it's $4.25. I got biscuits and gravy, it was very good and the biscuits were outstanding. My daughter got eggs Benedict, which were good, but she said next time she'd order then without the balsamic vinegar. The hash browns are unique and so good.  The twins shared a 1+2+3 breakfast (eggs, bacon and pancakes) and it was the perfect amount for them to split.  The pancakes are yummy and the maple syrup is real and comes to the table warm with a cinnamon stick in the bottle. Delicious, but I would probably ask for it without the cinnamon next time. Service was quick and our waiter was attentive without being annoying. For the 2 adult meals, 1 kids meal, 2 sodas, 1 tea and 1 juice the bill was $45.",

After an hour I went to the hostess stand and she said 5 minutes more we were next in line.  There were empty tables on the patio and in the restaurant.  15 minutes later I was still waiting.  I went to ask for the manager and a young girl said I am the manager.  I asked her name and she refused to give it to me.  I asked what the problem was and she said the kitchen is backed up, we have just opened and we have problems.  I asked since we were next on the list could we at least sit down and have a cup of coffee.  She said no and that if we don't like waiting we could leave.  I asked for the name of the owners and she said we are a family business and I don't give this information out.  she then proceeded to cross our name off the list and I asked if she was refusing to serve us.  She said oh I assume since you are not happy that you are leaving.  My friend said this is not the way you treat customers who are asking you a question and she said Oh Well you don't like it leave.  She said this in front of all of the customers who were also leaving.  In the parking lot all the customers leaving were telling people who where arriving not to both because management is rude and the wait is now over two hours.  There are many restaurants in Las Vegas and when you are treated rudely by managers there is no reason to return and give them hard earned money.  We left and went to I Hop on Tropicana; we were greeted by the manager who was friendly, the waitress was delightful and the food was delicious.  Plus we got to use our 2-1 coupons found online.  What a difference.  The owners of this restaurant need to go in and see what is going on.  I am the manager of a restaurant and if I found any of my team speaking to customers in such a manner they would not even see the door on the way out.",

    "text": "We went on Saturday, May 2nd around 9:00am. We were a party of six. The hostess (if you would call her that) advised us it would be a 20-25 minute wait. So we sat and waited. People came and also waited. After 25 minutes, we were going to inquire about the wait when another gentleman very politely spoke with the \"hostess\" to inquire about why no one was being seated when there were plenty of tables both inside and out that were available. The \"hostess\" stated that no one was being seated until all the tickets were cleared in the kitchen. While we were sitting waiting, the wait time increased significantly for newcomers. Some times were quoted at 45+ minutes. We felt this was unacceptable as we were never informed of what was happening and were not offered anything to drink, perhaps a discount for the long the wait or at the very least an apology. The gentleman asked to speak with the manager to which the \"hostess\" stated the manager had told her 10 minutes previously not to seat anyone. She apologized however she would not make eye contact when the apology was given. In fact, she completely looked the other way when she apologized not once, but twice. We ended up leaving. We advised the other patrons that were also waiting inside and out what had transpired and they left as well. The \"hostess\" had no business being in a hostess position as she had absolutely NO customer service skills. The manager should have come out and advised us what was happening and she never did. In fact, she never made eye contact to any of us. There needs to be more training or more staff. I had been there once before on a weekday morning and had a pleasant experience (other than the fact we paid almost $30 for a party of 2). Hence the reason I recommended to my family we should go. I was very disappointed at the experience we had. We won't be going back any time soon.",

From the spinning flowers hanging from the ceiling (which were just umbrellas on fans) to the extensive juice bar, this former Joes Crab Shack has come a long way in terms of its aesthetic appeal.   Food: Will 'meh' suffice? As I heard one lady say as we left, \"would have rather had a breakfast sandwich at Starbucks...\" All six meals on our table were overly seasoned and greasy. As for the highly publicized Pot of Bread, it's actually just a small cinnamon roll that, while warm and flaky, severely lacked sweetness.  Service: Dreadful. The initial wait was 35 minutes for a table of six, but hey, understandable for a new breakfast joint on a Saturday morning. What I really struggled with was the time between ordering and receiving our food. It's new, there's sure to be some inexperience, but 50 minutes from when you order to when the food gets to your table leads to an upsetting experience.",

    "text": "Let me start by saying,  I'm not a huge breakfast fan,  but the boyfriend is, so we thought we'd try this place.   UPON ARRIVAL: Every time we've been here there has been a wait (not long) but that's a good thing-it means people like it!  They have always been very quick to seat people as soon as a table opens.   SERVICE:  This is a big one for me,  as i work in the hospitality industry (bartender). Every time we have visited, we have received AMAZING service from EVERYONE; from the hostess,  to the server, to the food runner.   FOOD/MENU:  Not an overly large menu but i was very pleased at the vegetable options (as I'm a vegetarian). Food is outstanding,  as everything we've ever ordered has been delicious and sizable. If you're a coffee drinker,  order the French press.. it's enough for 2 and is very tasty.  They even give you a timer so you can have it as weak or as strong as you like.  AMBIANCE/DECOR:  It is spacious enough that you don't feel like you're sitting on someone else's lap, like in other smaller breakfast places. Colorful, upside down umbrellas grace the ceiling and is very cute. The floorplan is very open, and you don't feel like you are boxed in. Restrooms are always clean.   The boyfriend and i have been here at least a half a dozen times, with many more to come. I'd recommend this place to ANYONE and EVERYONE.",

Maybe it's a little above our lifestyle but I couldn't believe breakfast would cost that much. I didn't complain or anything but I was inwardly shocked.

I'm all about meat and potatoes and was expecting the usual over cooked steak- (as has been my usual experience for breakfast restaurants) It was yummy and properly done! yay! The juice tasted like someone literally went back to squeeze oranges for me. Really good.  The AC was a bit much though and I could hear other patrons saying they were cold too. Not a biggie but maybe bring a sweatshirt unless you eat outside :) Keep up the good work!",

The fiance and I went there this past Sunday for lunch...loved it. She had one of the steak burritos and I had the spiced steak. Meat was top-notch...rivaled the quality of more expensive steak restaurants. Oh and like many reviewers say about the other location - GET THE POT OF BREAD. You won't regret it, especially if you like cinnamon. Outdoor seating is nice too.  Service was a bit slow and it took a while to process our check due to computer system slowness. However, they just opened so I'll cut them some slack in this department. The food was that great that it compensates for the service slowness.  Our new go-to breakfast/brunch spot. Check it out, you won't regret it.",

The concept is great: eggs, cheese, bacon, ham, and a banger sausage on a bagel. In reality, the sandwich was hard to manage. It was impossible to pick up - big, bulky, and the bottom bagel was slippery and soggy. Each element tasted good, but I didn't get to take that big bite that would meld all the elements together. The fries that came on the side were super yummy though. My honey had the chicken fried steak with country gravy, eggs, and hash browns. He said it was okay, but he wasn't really fond of the breading on the steak. All in all it was a fun experience nut the food was only okay. Not sure I will go back.",

    "text": "I love that it's not your typical small seating breakfast spot with delicious food. This is a nice size restaurant! I say that because I always find the smaller restaurants have the best breakfast food. I wanted to have breakfast somewhere new today on this beautiful sunny Presidents Day. I decided to come here based off Yelp (of course, duh) and hence the weather I wanted to eat outside on their patio.   Fortunately, unlike most of you there was no wait today. The server was prompt once we were seated. The menu was overwhelming because everything looked so great. The only serve half & half and milk for creamer to your coffee. Personal preference: When you drink coffee every morning before leaving to work at home flavored creamer is just as addicting as the coffee itself. I felt obligated to order steak and eggs because that's what they're known for so there I was ordering \"The Ultimate\". I really wanted to try the bagel sandwiches but I stuck to my basic grounds for my first visit. I give my entree a 3/5 because one star for the amazing hash browns, 1 star for my eggs being over medium like I asked them to be and 1 star for my steak having the right amount of pink your average medium steak should be. The minus 2 stars for my overly seasoned steak. Did the cook accidentally smother my steak with black pepper or is this how they prep their steaks. On a higher note, my breakfast date had the three little pigs bagel entrees and her rating was a 5/5! Is noted they use high quality bacon instead of those measly small slices they serve else where. I knew I should've got the damn bagel entree to begin with, lol.   The highlight of our visit was the pot of bread who the kind server recommended. It's a dinner roll wrapped in a cinnamon roll with a side of homemade icing. You can substitute it for your toast with your entrees. Another highlight was the MILITARY DISCOUNT WITH YOUR ID OF COURSE! I'm not military but my friend was and I feel like this discount speaks volumes. I have a lot of military friends and I find it so respectable when places offer it!",

My mom ordered the carrot apple juice. When the server, Freddy or Frankie? brought out the drinks he dumped her juice as well as my orange juice all over us. My mom was wearing a white shirt and I light shoes. He was very apologetic and came back with a busboy and cleaned up. However when we got our bill all that was applied was a friend's and family discount which came to about $8. My mom's shirt was ruined, my white sneakers were ruined, and we had to go home and change which messed up our plans.  We understand accidents happen but no manager came out and when we told the girl at checkout what happened and that we'd like more of a discount she initially did not want to help at all. She ended up giving an additional $20 off but did not seem concerned when we showed her our clothing. This was not enough to replace the stained clothes and shoes and even after several washes they're ruined. Disappointed in how this was handled. Expected more from a non chain restaurant.",

The girl working the smoothie bar came over to offer us a sample of the berry smoothly because she had some leftover and it was delicious!

We explained to Kris that were so torn between all the wonderful dishes and asked her to just choose whatever dish she likes the most, for both of us.

Then the 2 young ladies were going to seat us on the far west side of the restaurant between to families with toddlers and the sun was beating in full force.  We asked if we could sit away from the sun next to some other people and were told no, that section is closed you can only sit in the booth.  Really? I asked and she said that was all they had available... Are you kidding me... the whole place was empty with the exception of 3 booth and one table.  We going to that area at least once a week, but instead we went over to Famous Dave's.  The owner needs to check these girls out or replace them.  What harm is there in sitting a few feet away... We will never go back.  : (",

We have talked to the manager before hoping that the service would improve and we could keep coming back.  Today was another day of poor service even though they were not very busy.  After talking to the manager/owner we realized the problem with their service is never going to improve because she thinks everything is just fine.   She stated she has plenty of happy customers basically letting us know she doesn't need our business.  Las Vegas is full of wonderful restaurants that offer great food and service and appreciate the patronage from their customers, especially those that live in the area and return regularly.  This restaurant is not one of those.  While we were paying our bill the manager/owner just stood there ignoring us.  Knowing we did not and have not had good service in her restaurant just didn't matter.  With management like this, I understand why service never gets better.",

I arrived at 2pm on a Sunday (they close at 3pm) & was seated right away. Service was excellent. I think my server's name was Roy. I love the spinning upside down umbrella decor & that all the servers wear pjs. The only thing I would recommend is to ask for the eggs benadict without the balsamic drizzle. The sweetness just doesn't compliment the hollandaise sauce. Also, the size of the pot of bread in the photos is a little misleading. It's served in a tiny espresso size cup, not a regular size coffee mug. However, it is the perfect size for a one person side dish so it didn't really bother me. I'd definitely get it again....& again.",

    "text": "I've eaten at Rise & Shine four times. Might go back just because good breakfast isn't easy to find in Vegas. Sure hotels have the $75 for two thing that could be decent but I can't find a consistent thing.  So, the reason I've been there 4 times was that #1 was pretty good. Egg white omelet that was nice and moist, not fluffed up like styrofoam and cheese melted nicely throughout. Yes the toast didn't arrive with breakfast and when it finally came it wasn't warm. Cold and bland. But OJ was great and so was the coffee even though the server asked if I wanted cream, which is odd, and didn't bring it anyway and I had to ask and wait while the coffee lost its edge. The place was crowded and we noticed the quirky umbrellas on the ceiling were for sale at $45 a pop. Being from NYC, the umbrella-on-the-go capital of the world, these seem cheap like that. You read it right. $45 clams. IN THE DESERT!!!!. The servers where pajamas and most have gray ones and you don't notice that's what they're wearing. It looks sloppy. Not really amused by it. They sell them too. Something like 25-35 clams for those. There's nothing great about them. It seemed greedy.  All in all trip #1 was decent. Trip #2 started going downhill fast. Same issue with the cream for coffee and the cold toast late with the omelet. It seemed like this is planned or something. OJ-great but this time asked twice. Egg white omelet was nothing like the first time. It was fluffed up and dry. So so but with cold toast it wasn't that good. We did try the pancakes, they were very good flavor, but arrived 5 minutes after the rest of the food. I'm pretty sure, based on when I asked, that it was a kitchen error, not server. Cause it came out right then.  I have no idea why we came a fourth time because, oh yeah, because our new favorite place across the parking lot didn't open until 7 so we drove over here, parked walked the 150 feet around the building to find they opened at 7 too. But #3 was a doosie. Yes. Had to double ask for cream for coffee. Got the late cold toast with the overcooked omelet, but the icing on the cake was the pancakes. I told the waitress we were going to take the pancakes to go. I just wanted a fork full-very good. She brought a box. I paid, we got up to go, walked out without the pancakes, got half-way around the building and ran back for them. Table was still as we left it, not cleared, but the cakes were gone. I asked and she said, well we threw them out, they couldn't leave food around, even though my unfinished omelet was still on a plate waiting for a busser. No joke. No one ran us down to say \"hey you forgot your cakes!!\" Nope. Gone.   Never in my life have I seen this and I'm from NYC not small town America.   So 86 Rise & Shine and their $45 dollar dopey umbrellas. The Crab Shack before it was bad too and a coat of Sesame Street yellow paint ain't changing anything.",

I walked in and loved the decor and seeing the staff in their PJ's. The place wasn't packed at all but for some reason we had to wait for the hostess to seat us. When she finally did approach us, there was no smile on her face and a lack of enthusiasm to say the least. She almost looked as though we had disturbed her. Whoa! She grabbed the menus and told us to follow her.. still no \"hi welcome in\" nothing.  Since she didn't ask, before I followed her I asked if there was a booth available, she snapped at me and said we were headed to a booth. Whoa again! That alone left a bad taste in all of our mouths. Our waitress was very friendly and upbeat. After waiting some time for our order, I was disappointed with my chicken and waffles. The chicken was bland but my waffle was yummy. My friend loved her french toast and everything else was mediocre. To be honest for 3 people and a $86 tab for a ok breakfast with a side of bad attitude I think this will be my first and last visit to Rise & Shine.",

Adam was our server, who was helpful about the menu items and very attentive about our particular requests (water no ice, Cooking spray vs butter for the omelet, etc).  The steak and eggs breakfast was some of the best I have had in a while.  I enjoyed a treat with the Pot O'Bread, requesting the cream cheese syrup on the side instead of butter.  It was yummy-moan-worthy-goodness.  Their organic hot sauce has sadly spoiled me from all others.  If I use Tapatio, Cholula or Tabasco at another restaurant, I find myself thinking fondly of Rise & Shine's hot sauce... which I had to purchase.",

    "text": "This is my new favorite breakfast place in Vegas. We both ordered a steak and egg variation, I had the steak and omelette and Lily had the ultimate steak and eggs. First off, the steak was a quality cut of meat. I've been to more that my fair share of breakfast places that serve you a grissled piece of meat that represents what should be steak, this place is not that. Our eggs were delicious and the hash browns were a perfect blend of crispy and soft. I ordered a blended fruit drink and was pleasantly surprised by fresh fruit drink, not a sugary canned drink. And finally on to the biscuit, as soon as I saw it I knew, it was just like my grand mother made, delicious. If I had another hand they would have three thumbs up... Eat here...",

I mean honestly, I have reviewed another breakfast place in town and thought I saw the worlds largest pancake. NOPE! This places pancakes would break records. Not to mention their unique pancake flavors. I had the Banana Frosted Flake Pancakes. You read that right, they make a pancake with Bananas and Frosted Flakes in them, they also put some pecans in their for a little extra treat. I truly believe that when God created the pancake his eventual goal was the Banana Frosted Flake Pancakes. These were freaking awesome! Did I mention they were huge. A normal person needs to just ask for the to go box when the food comes out, I did. Oh and I enjoyed me some Banana Frosted Flake Pancakes the next two mornings on what I put in that to go box. My wife was also super complementary of their country gravy and biscuits (she is not a fan of pancakes - I know lame...), but we are from the southeast originally so she is somewhat of an expert where gravy is concerned and this she said was the best she has had in Vegas. The place is family friendly and I now take the title I granted another establishment and give it to this place. BEST BREAKFAST IN VEGAS!",

It seems that the front  (and only visible)  entrance is up hill from the parking lot. I did not have my walker with me so was unable to walk that far unassisted. It would be nice if you posted a sign in the parking lot showing where the front entrance is.  To just walk around the building looking for a way in is very difficult on those with difficulty ambulating.  Would enjoy visiting this restaurant in the future but thought you should know that your entrance is very unfriendly for some disabled patrons.",

    "text": "I debated between a 3 and 4 star review for this breakfast restaurant. The food itself was decent, but the overall experience.. I'm kinda meh on it.   Of course, I expect pretty much any breakfast/brunch restaurant to have a wait at around 11a on a Sunday, and Rise & Shine was no exception. The wait was about 30 minutes, which wasn't terrible, but I was ready to eat by the time we were seated.  Our server, while.. serviceable, had a distinct lack of warmth. She took our orders, came back to check on us, filled our water and coffee, but it all felt very robotic, almost like we were a bother. She never cracked a smile until she handed us the bill. O-Kay.... is it chilly in here?   The food itself was good, though. I really enjoyed my French toast crunch (I don't think that's what it was really called). The bread was just thick enough, the batter yummy, and it had just enough crunch to it. The turkey kilbasa was alright- pretty much a hot dog. The eggs were fine- although be forewarned, if you order scrambled eggs, they aren't actually scrambled. They're fried eggs mixed up in a pan. My dining companion had a real problem with this!   I sampled a bite of the amazingly HUGE pancakes. They were good, very dense and fluffy.   So remember the wait to get seated? Well, the wait to pay our bill was almost as long! Checkout was at the register up front, which is fine, but we stood in line at least 15 minutes in order to pay. They definitely need a better system here.  The two meals and 1 cup of coffee ended up coming to $35... a smidge over what I prefer to spend on breakfast, but oh well.   Rise & Shine.. not bad, but I won't go out of my way to return. Shine on!",

The food was fantastic, the staff was friendly and it was just the right price. I had a Philly cheese steak bagel sandwich, the meat was delicious, I would recommend going with a plain bagel rather than the everything bagel though because the flavors in the bagel were a little overwhelming. Hubby had a steak and chorizo burrito. The flavors in it were excellent, the sauce on it was great and the beans served in n the side were very tasty as well. The decor is cute and the wait staff dress in pajamas which is a fun and cute touch.  Overall very happy with our experience.",

I ordered a chicken sandwich and was asked if I wanted fries or hash browns. I said hash browns. Later the waitress brings my food immediately apologizing that they messed up and gave me fries cause that's what they are used to. She said do you want me to take it back and fix it or just bring your hash browns on the side. I said well I'd rather just get on the side at this point so you don't take my sandwich and it takes longer. Ok, so here comes my hash browns and the waitress with a rubber glove. She then reaches onto my plate and says ok let me take these fries so they can see I didn't leave them with you. Seriously? Did that just happen? I've never heard of such a thing!! She was confused why i was confused!! Absolutely absurd! My 16 month old cousin ate the leftover fries off my plate! Yay! The chicken sandwich was horribly dry. So crazy!!",

The first time we ordered some it was a bit cold and unenjoyable but the times when it was warm it was amazing...!! The red velvet pancakes I could go without it was like eating a whole thing of cake and that's not what I expected, but I'm sure other people would enjoy it!! It is literally 4x the size of my hand and was spilling out of the plate! Good to share with 3-4 people! Ultimate was pretty good! The steak was pretty decent, if you want medium rare I definitely recommend asking for rare instead since it continues cooking as they serve it. The eggs the first time we ordered this tasted like they had been cooked in the steal far and sauces and it was absolutely divine!! The other instances weren't the case and was lackluster. The hashbrowns are wonderful...!!! The sausages are pretty good! But not that amazing. The banana foster waffles ARE SO GOOD.... ordered it twice!! The rest weren't particularly noteworthy to be honest!   The ambiance is great, the service is sweet and they also have cute socks for sale. It's cozy and we returned twice within our week and a half trip to LV so we definitely enjoyed our stay!",

And there are pajamas, the servers are actually all wearing pj's... which is encouraging- next time I'll partake and we can all be friends. I'm really enjoying the vibe.  On to the food - the portions are large and the menu has a mix of favorites and lots of mixing-it-up. The egg-in-the-hole bacon French toast sounded creative. However, I went for the Three Pigs bagel sandwich with hash browns. It was huge! The over medium eggs were cooked perfectly - that's a deal breaker, so I was very happy that they were so drippy and messy! The sandwich was a monster; it was ooey, gooey, meaty, cheesy all over the place. The sandwich was good, liked the banger especially & the everything bagel. I was not happy with the soggy hash browns that tasted weirdly burnt and soggy at the same time. The neighbors' fries looked better.  Overall, it's a bright atmosphere, service was good, and the sandwich was good & from what I've seen so far - it's a decent breakfast spot in the area.",

Our server was very friendly and offered to review the menu since it's a little overwhelming. The three plates we had were all very large ports and I couldn't even finish my eggs and bacon.

I'd definitely suggest trying out any of their specialty pancakes (we had red velvet with cream cheese syrup - DIVINE!) enjoy...",

    "text": "Another Vegas Breakfast spot with a gourmet touch. If you're a visitor here you should leave the strip and explore. If you're a local you should be adding this spot on your Vegas gem list. This establishment specializes with Steak and eggs variations.The menu is strong and has a lot of options. However, this morning since its close to the 4th of July and my meat consumption has been kinda of consistent over the past month. I decided to do the Chicken and waffles. Started off with a awesome Hazelnut cappuccino. I might add they have a wonderful cappuccino and fresh juice selection. I want to inject this idea to those of you who are kind enough to read my post. Don't ruin your experience by comparing this establishments Chicken and waffles to another's establishments Chicken and waffles. The dish was huge. Enormous lightly battered fluffy and crunchy chicken breast. Moist not heavily seasoned. Waffles were also gigantic soft and airy. Great combination of different flavors and taste. The Maple Syrup accented the chicken with waffles. One of the most important aspects was my interaction with the staff. Talking with Barry my server was delightful. Very personable and inviting. The young lady who was the hostess was very professional and informative. About the restaurant. Both shared interesting tidbits about the restaurant. I had a great time and wonderful experience. You will too.",

Usually for me it's about a 10 -15 min wait.   The downfall of this place is the service. It sometimes takes a while for the server to get the drink / food order.

They were busy, so I do take that into account but I watched three tables next to me get their food before ours, even though we sat and ordered way before them. I ordered a boring salad and some fruit because that's all they offered for plant based eaters but on our way out, they had a sign up that said they had the Impossible Burger, which I totally could have had. They didn't have that sign up when I first got there, it was maybe in a different spot or something but it definitely wasn't there when we walked in. I would've ordered that- they should add a note to the menu or do a specials flyer for the table. I'm disappointed.",

We ordered the Steak with white mushroom cheese omelette, Eggs Benedict, and S'mores Waffle. All of the food was really great and the presentation looked really good. They were even selling sox at the restaurant? My son bought two pairs. This is the only restaurant I've been to that sells sox. The juice from the juice bar was really good.

Depending on where in the lot you park, it may be challenging to find the front door, but there is a side door.  ATMOSPHERE- Its a bright inviting place, the decor was very winsome and perhaps enchanting especially the large flower decorations hanging from the ceiling.  SERVICE- Service was very attentive, and i suppose that's much better than wondering where your server is. Everything was done expeditiously.   FOOD- The food was presented very neatly and in an appealing manner -a professional plating presentation indeed. The food tasted fresh and seemed to be up to today's standard. The OJ was freshly squeezed juice and not that syrupy stuff out of a commercial grade machine btw.  All in all it was a good breakfast, but nothing spectacular or to write home about, besides the decor and employees pajama theme (which was unique and inviting) it was a pretty basic experience and the prices were a touch higher then i'd have liked....but after some other breakfast experiences at other joints in town i wouldn't write this one off as this is a pretty good option",

The servers are all so sweet and so cute in their Jammie's so I'm sure no one would care if you went and ate in your jammies too ! We had Lucelia and she was such a doll! Her bright smile and brighter personality would make anyone feel welcomed and happy to be there. Super management material right there !   2. The decor is super cute and fun to look at. I feel like it's  a great spot for anyone and everyone.    3.  The food wasn't bad!   I got the watermelon and strawberry juice. It was a bit bland but I genuinely didn't expect it to be overly sweet for this time of season as both fruits are out of season. It was still super tasty, fresh and all fresh from its fruits.  My kid got the Cinnamon Toast Crunch French toast and let me say one thing #Yummmmy it was sooo delish.   I got the country fried steak because I've been staying off fried foods and really wanted something country for this country gal. The steak wasn't a typical country fried steak to me. It was a bit too greasy and the breading just fell right off and I'm used to my steak being pulverized by a tenderizer BUT the flavor was really good and the flavor of the hash browns also amazing. I asked for my eggs over medium and they were cooked to perfection. I'm sure I'll try something a lot lighter the next time we go in.   Perfect start to our daughter mother day today!",

The food is overpriced and they don't do the basic breakfast items well. The ham steak is dry. Hash browns were too loose and burnt. The biscuits were too hard... even after pouring gravy over them.  Country gravy was ok. The country fried steak was large but nothing special. $17 for an average country fried steak, eggs and burnt hash browns and you can't include some bread? No thanks. If I wanted to spend that much for my breakfast I'd rather go to Kitchen Table Squared at the Gramercy.   They have some specialty breakfast items that are probably pretty good but if this breakfast place can't handle cooking hash browns then they certainly won't get my business again.  However, their cup o bread is delicious so I will give them that.",

She offered to box up our leftovers for us and everything. The waiters and waitresses wear pajamas as their uniform which goes with the whole cute rise and shine theme. The restaurant itself is so cute and has these umbrellas hanging down from the ceiling and it's very warm and cozy. Perfect for a rainy day brunch with your significant other or just a fun day out with the family. If you get Amberly as your waitress, then you are guaranteed amazing service!",

    "text": "I just left this place and I'm pretty angry... Angry that I haven't been here sooner!  This is easily one of the best places for breakfast in Las Vegas.    I'm a total coffee snob, so the fact they have French Press coffee is reason enough for me to go back.  I love that they bring over this little timer for you to use and decide how strong you want your coffee.    I will also go on to say that I'm basically a retired red meat eater, so it's very rare(no pun intended) that I decide to eat a steak.  I woke up today fiending for some red meat, but I'm mulling over whether or not I want to break my meat eating for a breakfast place.  Breakfast places, even good ones, are never really known for quality steak.    I'm glad I chose this place!  There are so many amazing options on the menu to choose from, my decision was hard, but I figured I might as well try the restaurant's namesake and I'm glad I did.    I got the \"The Ultimate\" which was a spice-rubbed thin cut rib eye steak, potatoes, eggs and a choice of bread.  I opted for the biscuit.    The Steak:  Juicy, full of flavor, tender and effin delicious!  Seriously, better than some middle of the road steak houses I've been to in vegas.    The Eggs:  Eggs were eggs. They were good.  The Potatoes:  Loved them!  Kind of like wide cut hashbrowns, but better.    The Biscuit:  Dense, soft, crunchy on the outside, soft on the inside.  They were delicious!   The Service: Great!  Attentive, friendly and fast.   It will be a while before I eat red meat again, but it won't be a while before I go back.  So many other things I want to try!",

He didn't get offered any pot of bread, biscuit or toast. We asked our waiter and he said NO so fast. We then asked for the menu again from a different waiter. And it's written right there on the menu. The dish should come with pot of bread, biscuit or toast. He immediately came when he saw us asked for the menu again and apologized but he said this is because the iPad doesn't have an option for it. Hello. You're a waiter. You should know the menu like the back of your hand. It's your job, buddy. Not owning the mistake and quick saying no to a customer is a BAD customer service. Btw. He then gave us a very sad ONe piece of biscuit.  Btw the banana foster waffle that I ordered was okay. Good toppings but the batter was so cake-y. Not like waffle.  On top of this, as we pay our bills at the cashier, there is a customer walk in. This is 2:47. Aaaaand the cashier told us, \"never fails, 10 min before we closed\". WoW. Talking about BAD customer service ever. Who ever train the people here should be seriously questioned if they want their customer coming back to the restaurant.  And yes.  We still tip our waiter. Because we are nice people.",

I felt pretty offended to be honest. That's when I ask the server to send the manager over  a lady wearing pijamas came to my table and I was like are you the manager, I told her that I was offended and I was not asking for me to not pay for the food or asking for any discounts or a different dish I just wanted a warm meal. She never ask me how can she fix the situation she made it sound like it was my fault because I didn't want a different dish. At the end she still charge me for the cold food I didn't eat and expecting me to come back to redeem my 5off coupon.I hated that place. Some servers wear pijamas which looks pretty lazy the place is not homey not cozy everyone look miserable there. That is definitely a place where I don't want to go back ever, if I only had an option to give this place a 0",

People lined up outside waiting,  to while four tables sat unoccupied... Looks like a problem with management and leadership",

When we arrived the hostess was pleasant enough and we were seated fairly quickly considering they only had maybe seven tables of customers. Our server was very nice, however this seemed to be his first server job. We ordered our food and no joke waited 25+ minutes for it to come out. This wasn't a huge deal as we were in no rush however the server NEVER checked in on us or offered anything while we were waiting. Zero acknowledgment that the food was very very late. We were so happy when it finally arrived as we were starving and it looked really good! Looks can be deceiving. I ordered the eggs Benedict and the sauce was awful! It tasted like it was a mix, which I think is super sad at a breakfast restaurant, also one of my eggs was hard! My husband had the steak omelette and he barely touched it. The icing on the cake was when we went to pay we asked for change and our server never returned or acknowledged us again even though we sat there waiting for almost 10 minutes! He stole his tip that's for sure! Overall very very disappointing as the location and restaurant style were perfect. Hopefully they figure out how to operate a successful business soon as we would love to come back if they overhaul the staff and menu!",

It is after all a soft opening and was willing to give them a break when it hit the 60 minute mark. We heard the hosts saying we were about to be sat next... We like to keep an eye on things UNTIL a group of 3 walked in and approached the hostess. They said something to the host who walked away then came back and told them they would be sat next. Thinking this HAD TO BE some sort of mistake I waited to see what would happen. A minute later the host called them to take them to what was suppose to be MY TABLE!!!! So I went to ask the hostess's what happened and why they got sat first and so fast... They told me it was the owner's best friend and therefore had priority seating.WOW  oh and that I would be seated shortly... Hmmm no thanx you obviously don't want my business. This is my first and probably only yelp review ever... Being in the restaurant industry myself in usually very understanding but this just set me off..Off to Bite around the corner",

All three times that I visited, the service was extremely slow and the servers consistently lacked a pleasant attitude and basic service skills.  The food is mediocre at best and certainly not worth the price.  This pains me as I love the location near Southern Highlands and I was extremely excited when I learned they were opening a new location less than a mile from my home.  On my third and last visit which also happened to be my birthday we did not even make it through coffee before a handful of issues came up.  Even something as simple as creamer for my coffee was a task proven to be challenging.  Upon checkout I had no intention of any sort of complaint - I just simply wanted to pay our tab and be on our way until I was questioned on why we were leaving without eating so, of course, I was willing to offer my feedback only to receive a very rude, defensive response from the Rise & Shine employee.  What a shame.  Luckily I wasn't willing to allow such a negative start to my day ruin any part of my Birthday so we were off to a nearby breakfast gem that took great care of us!  I will not return to Rise & Shine.",

Our server I want to say Amber or Alexa although I'm not positive if that was the name really didn't seem to care about us. The service from her was really textbook and straight to the script which would have been fine if she wasn't actually having interactions with the other tables in our sections, maybe it was because we are a 22 year old couple with a 7 month old baby and so we seem unapproachable? Or maybe it was because we weren't an elderly couple talking about juicing. Either way it was pretty off putting on a service aspect. Anyway I ordered the loco moco medium rare and ended up with a crispy on the outside almost raw on the inside burger which was fine until my garbage disposal method of eating started to slow and I actually tasted the consistency and temperature difference of the outside and inside of the meat and felt kind of sick (it didn't actually make me sick) also kind of found it irritating that the hostess had tables waiting when there were tons of open tables. All in all won't be back 2 stars one badly cooked burger but other decent food but impersonal service isn't good but don't be interested in one table and a a robot to the next.",

As you enter the decor is inviting with giant upside-down umbrellas painted like flowers spinning from the ceiling.  We were greeted by the holidays who sat us next to the kitchen, even though the restaurant was practically empty. There are some terms on the menu that were unfamiliar, like \"pot of bread\". We had to all and we're told that it is a lightly sweet cinnamon roll with no frosting baked in a tea cup.  I tried that ad my bread option with the 2 egg breakfast. The eggs were done as I asked and treated fine.  My husband ordered the steak and chilaquiles.  We're surprised that the chilaquiles were made with doritos chips. The steal looked like someone reused another steak and shaved it in half. When we asked for a box the server was not even curious about why my husband ate so little. The bill was $35 before tip.  I don't think this will be a place we come back to for breakfast.",

    "text": "My wife and I paid a visit for the first time on weekday just after the lunch hour. First off--great chicken fried steak. Made on premises which is a rare thing indeed. Most places use the frozen ready to cook version. I'd give it a perfect 10 except that it was a bit to 'spicy' for my personal taste (cayenne pepper?)...but very close. The gravy was also excellent.  Very good potatoes. Waiter was a good guy and attentive enough. What really surprised and disappointed me was how messy the whole place was. I am far from a 'neat-freak' but  I couldn't help but notice how dirty the men's bathroom was -- sinks filthy, toilets dirty and trash overflowing onto the floor. The main floors in the restaurant had lots of bits of food and other 'droppings' visible. I realize it was after the lunch rush but there were more employees milling around than there were customers in the place. It would seem to be a simple management decision to have someone begin an effort to clean up. Which brings me to a strange moment. When my wife and I arrived she went to the restroom while I was being seated. As I mention, the place during this time of day was far from busy and there were plenty of open tables and booths. I requested to the hostess the we be seated at a table rather than a booth. She proceeds to lead me to a table right in front of the kitchen which is a location I am usually not a snob about...however there were two workers mopping the floor in the area between the table and the kitchen entrance. I stood there kind of waiting for the mopping to get done thinking to myself \"why, in this sea of empty tables, would she interrupt these guys and want to sit us here?\" I was getting ready to nicely ask for another table when a management-type lady came over and whispered into the ear of the hostess....who then picked up our menus off the table and said to me...\"oh, lets move you...I didn't realize they were mopping\"?!?!?!? Wow.  So..overall a very good review for the food (other than the surprisingly dry and boring wheat toast). My wife ordered a salad and gave it a solid \"A\".   Pretty sure we'll be back -- seems like a great place to bring out-of-town guests. I am going to assume the cleanliness issues were a fluke (again, lots of various level employees milling around and not one of them cleaning -- other than our two moppers at the kitchen entrance who weren't observed doing any other cleaning up during our one hour there) rather than poor management.  This would have been a four-star review rather than a three -- and as I said -- I am NOT a clean-freak so the condition of the facility was enough to garner my attention.",

    "text": "As an avid bruncher and vegas native, I like to think I know a thing or two about local breakfast eateries. Been meaning to try this spot for a few months now as its within a few miles from home and could easily become the go to location. Made plans ahead of time with another couple who hadn't tried this spot either but was interested.  Arrived around 11am on a Sunday to a 30 min wait. Not surprising and expected for time and day. What was surprising was how slow service seemed to move with how big the restaurant was. I've worked in the restaurant industry in the past so it didn't take long to notice where the bottleneck issues were coming from. Regardless, I wasn't too annoyed as it was still Sunday and brunchday afterall. Our servers name was Chelsea, she was super friendly and welcoming within a few seconds of seating. They have a nice looking beverage bar in the corner but not an elaborate beverage list to match. Fresh squeezed OG is available. Ambience is fun and fresh and the Jammie's are a kitchy touch. The menu has a nice variety of choices which is great but nothing signature. Chelsea informed us that the waffle iron was not working at the moment which was off to me they only had one waffle machine and cut a chunk of the menu options right away. Our table ordered a Loco Moco, Chilaquiles, chicken fried steak, and house pancakes. Drinks were quick and coffee was hot and fresh. Time seemed to have dragged on by the time our plates arrived ( We had three cups of coffee. ) Chelsea was very attentive and reassuring our order was on its way. When our food arrived it was dropped off by one staff member who could only carry 3/4 of the dishes. No biggie but she didn't acknowledge the lack of complete order and left. Pancakes arrived not too long after. These cakes were massive. I was pumped. The syrup is served warm which is great.  FOOD QUALITY AND TASTE- the massive pancakes are a dense heavy cake and very sweet. Not fluffy like I envisioned. Too dry to eat on their own but overkill sweet with syrup. Seemed like a waffle dough/batter to me. My co-eater did eat a share as I could barely make a dent. The chilaquiles looked the part but was off in traditional red sauce flavor but not a bad try. The loco Moco comes with a teriyaki gravy poured over the dish and would have preferred it on the side. The sweet/salty flavor was overkill and ruined the dish. The spam was also on the burned side so another intense flavor added to the teriyaki gravy profile. Hard pass. The chicken fried steak was a success as were all the eggs at the table.  We didn't linger after completing our meal and walked out of there about 2 hours and $75 later. Chelsea saved the experience for us but an overall opinion of the meal won't make us regulars but worth another try.",

    "text": "New location opened on Flamingo & 215. Was so crowded but worth the wait. Ordered our breakfast, not that complicated, wanted regular eggs instead of egg whites for my omelette didn't think it was a big deal & waiter said it was ok. I knew it was going to be bad when we first got our coffees and literally 10 mins later we got our pot of bread after reminding the waiter first. He said sorry & a couple of minutes later we finally got the pot of bread. Minutes later waiter returned to say sorry for the delay for the food but there were \"issues in the kitchen.\" As we are getting our food the waiter comes by & says sorry but the chef won't make my omelette with regular eggs because it's on the menu with egg whites then quickly asked if I wanted to order something else from the menu and by this time we've been waiting like 25 mins for our food. But the other waitress handing us our food says of course you can get what you order which was an omelette with regular eggs. Then the waiter says oh I didn't know that. He then says I must of not put in the order correctly. He only admitted his mistake because the other waitress said it in front of him. So first he lied by blaming the chef that the order would not be done by the chef then when he got caught he said oh yeah I must not have put the order in right. So I asked to speak with the manager, Casey, & she was amazing. She apologized & said the waiter was new and there was no excuse for waiting until the wrong order was cooked & brought it to the table. It seemed he had done this to other tables as well because the table behind us was also having issues with their order from our same waiter. Casey took care of our entire meal. I told her I wasn't looking for anything free, just making her aware of the situation but she still took care of everything. So my upsetting late late breakfast was better thanks to Casey. And by the way I did get my omelette with regular eggs.",

Water glasses sat empty,  no refills on anything. The waiter said how was everything  we sort of wins and he walked away  never giving us a chance to explain about the food .  The cashier asked how was everything I said the food was atrocious the service was terrible  and she shrugged it off . I said we will not return We drove off after paying our bill and everyone pulled off to the side of the 215 and were physically ill. I don't know what happened but for people physically ill at the same time? I would venture and say it was the food.",

The environment is fun and exciting. There are dancing umbrellas hanging from the ceiling and the waiters/waitresses wear onesie pajamas!! The food is great. You can order a \"cup o bread\" which is a cinnamon roll in a tea cup! Fun fun fun!!! I ordered the crunchy cinnamon French toast platter. It was amazing!!!! I don't think there is a bad thing on the menu. I would defined recommend trying this place at least once. Especially if you have someone visiting town",

Ladies, if you have a man with an appetite, this is the place. I ordered their pancakes and to my surprise, their pancakes are larger than the plate. $10 pancakes and he'll be full lol. My mom ordered their waffle and her taste buds were delighted.... What I like that stood out was their maple syrup. It had cinnamon sticks in the jar and it was served warm. Sweet tooth was satisfied.   Would come back and try their steak next time. :)",

I ordered a veggie omelet with steak and they brought me an all meat omelet with steak. Took a little time to get the right one but I knew that already because it was steak. It wasn't a bad experience. The restaurant was fun and cute.",

Walking to our table was fun and our waitress was patient with us as we looked at all the beautiful decorations inside. My infant son was mesmerized and entertained by the decor the whole time!  I ordered their fresh green juice and their breakfast with eggs, bacon, and hash browns. My juice was fresh and delicious and my food was well seasoned, cooked, and presented!  Every employee was wearing pajamas and each individual employee was cheerful, helpful, and made us all feel welcome and wanted.   All of our food was exceptionally prepared and served. The restaurant is clean and thoughtfully decorated. The staff is friendly and efficient. We can wait to return and try everything on their menu!",

The cornbeef has was made from cornbeef brisket. This is definitely different. It was pretty good but had a hint of of rosemary or some other type of seasoning which gave it an odd flavor. Honestly, they could have left that off and it would have been so much better. The waffle was fine.   They're pricey for what you're getting. You can get more bang for your buck elsewhere. If you're budget conscious, then look elsewhere.   Would I come back? Probably not.   Would I recommend it? No.   Were the staff friendly? No. Everyone was just robotic doing their job. It was not crowded when we were here.",

Did not realize it would be just as long here for Sunday brunch but we were quoted a wait time of 25 minutes and were seated in about 20. We got a nice big booth in Nicole L's section. I thought this was a very cute place with the spinning umbrellas on the ceiling along with the funny t-shirts for sale.   My husband and I were in the mood for corned beef and hash with eggs so we both got that along with French press coffee. We also chose the cup of bread which is basically a warm cinnamon roll with a side of cream cheese frosting. Our eggs were cooked correctly and the corned beef and hash was awesome.   The coffee gives you 3 full cups and it's presented with a little timer for 3,4, and 5 minutes so you can choose how long you want it steeped. Nicole was on top of our drinks and food and everything was very good. We want to come back and order the pancakes next time.",

The service was something to be desired, the place looks like it has never been dusted, the umbrellas hanging from the ceiling had cobwebs all over them and this is hanging right over my table.  DO NOT buy any of their iced coffee.  It's mostly ice and about 3 sips through a straw before it's gone, at a cost of 4.35 a glass with no refills.  Jack in the box has a way better iced coffee at a lower cost and much more for your money, hell McDonald's has better iced coffee for a lower price.  The food was decent with exception to their tasteless hash browns which is the only reason they got a star from me.  I honestly wish I went to Denny's!  I will not be returning their and I hope this was helpful",

So since she refused, I ordered something else because of allergy issues and I now know this is not a place I can come often or recommend to people with allergy issues because it does not seem to be a concern here especially with this server.  Customer service and allergy concerns should start with the manager and apparently this location it's not impressed upon the servers to go ask when requested.  If you have good allergies beware of this location.  I'll spend my money someplace else.  I only came here because of a family bday desire.  I won't come back to a place that refuses to go ask..plus we had two small kids in our party, no one ever brought them crayons and paper to draw on, we had to get it ourselves.  In addition, we had to request refills on coffee and drinks, etc.  I know this may sound picky but in a town that has so many choices for you to spend your money at, why pick a place that in appearance does not care about the customers on a personal level because of the amount of business that passes through, they will continue to make money, so customer satisfaction I guess does not have to be a priority...",

The steaks are always seasoned and cooked to perfection . I had one of the best lattes I've ever tried here . I have also tried the Green GOGO juice and it's also good .   This menu is huge and I have yet to try something that I didn't love . There is literally something for everyone on this menu. If you're not in the mood for breakfast they also have lunch items.

Check this place out ASAP .",

    "text": "I have visited a couple times before this review. What stands out in my mind is that they serve far too much food for breakfast/lunch. Sure, they offer a box to take the leftovers home, but, unless you are sharing the food with a dog, breakfast food doesn't keep or reheat very well.   The bread in a cup is great. To me, that's breakfast -- then your breakfast arrives. Everything I've tasted was good. The avocado, turkey, bacon, swiss on a bagel was good, big and messy (Roasted Turkey California Bagel). I've had the \"Loco Moco\" steak burger with Spam and \"gravy-yaki\" sauce. Very good.   The staff wearing pajamas is cute, but inconsistent. Makes those who are wearing pajamas look odd. Embrace it or not.  Clean. Friendly (for Vegas). Crowded. Usually a wait.  I will complain about a pet peeve of mine: poorly named menu items. If it's a burrito, call it a burrito. It's not \"bananas Foster\" just because the bananas have cinnamon on them. It's not \"California\" because of an avocado. Chopped steak does not make it \"Philly-Style,\" with or without onions and peppers. Still not sure what a \"chilaquiles\" is. I looked it up. It's supposed to be a traditional Mexican dish with tortilla chips. Sounds like breakfast nachos, but it doesn't say that on the menu. I might like breakfast nachos, and I may have ordered them if I knew what it was.  And I'm not sure chocolate and pancakes go together -- ever.   If your not in a rush and like a well-made-over Crab Shack, enjoy a nice breakfast or brunch!",

My friend had the ham steak. It was large and he felt well worth the money. It had a good flavor but the rest of his meal was bland at best.  I had the Moco Loco and was quite disappointed. The meal was over cooked. The rice was dry and crunchy. The steak burger was ordered medium and was provided as well done. It had a burnt taste to it.  Overall very disappointed - especially when it was $37.00 for the two meals.",

I've tried many things on their menu, and usually I'm a creature of habit, but nothing here has ever disappointed me. (Or any of my guests)   For the most part everything is big enough to share and they have something on the menu for every taste and diet.  The chilaquiles with steak is one of my favorites. Crunchy, savory...add a cup of that amazing cinnamon roll and all your taste buds will feel like they're at a party.   Their ribeye steak and eggs is always cooked to perfection. I love how they make their steaks charred on the outside.   I recently discovered their freshly squeezed juices and wowza! I didn't know I loved kale. (I don't, but with honeydew melon, apples, and cucumber you'd think I was healthy. Nope, just a glutton. Hehe.)   At the location on Flamingo I love to watch the kitchen workers make the food while sitting at the bar. Their teamwork is amazing to see and the hard work they put into the food is impressive. I appreciate the food more when I see how they take pride in the quality of it. Well done team!   Every time I have someone come visit I take them here. EVERY time. Then, they ask about it when they come back. THAT is how you know it's good.   Writing this I already can't wait to go back!",

This one is somewhat of a journey from my neck of the woods as I reside of the southeast side of town, but let me just tell you that bomb breakfast like this is well worth the journey.   Located on the cusp of Summerlin, just off the 215 exit at Flamingo, breakfast goers and hungry customers can easily spot this breakfast joint and stop in for a delicious hearty breakfast. They have ample parking and seating so your wait time will be minimal. We were seated almost instantaneously and before I could mouth the words \"coffee\", our kind server had already greeted us at our table with a fresh pot in hand. Now that's what I call impeccable service!  After glancing over their extensive menu, I decided to order the steak and chorizo breakfast burrito. I had just completed a 5k run earlier that morning so my appetite was all riled up and ready to conquer this bad boy. Every bite was simply fantastic, plus they included both red and green sauce along with an extra side of salsa for just enough extra kick! We also tried the \"Cup O' Bread\" which is basically a warm cinnamon roll in a mug with the frosting on the side. It's the perfect serving size and a great compliment to your breakfast entree or even just a simple cup of coffee.   All in all, I'm really happy to have discovered another incredible breakfast spot in our city. I can honestly say i now I have another great reason to come back to this side of town real soon!",

Also they have freshly squeezed juice and lots of healthy options for vegetarians. This place is also great for big parties, they have roomy indoor and outdoor seating. Highly recommend for breakfast!",

First, I am not a morning person so getting here at 11AM meant I had to wait 20 minutes. But once 20mins hit, I was sat. They turned tables really fast so that was awesome.  Menu was huge, a lot to choose from. I ordered an ice coffee, which I would not get again just because it kind of had a powdery taste to it, but still good. I also got the eggs Benedict, which I've never had before, and it was very tasty! My boyfriend had a bite and said compared to others, it was on the better side.   Good service, good food. I'd come back!",

    "text": "This is a surprisingly good place yet for some reason not as popular as the many other overcrowded breakfast joints in Las Vegas.   I really don't get why some of the packed and overpriced egg joints are so busy and serve bad food, slowly, and are often out of menu items. Some serve store-bought items like muffins and charge several bucks for something you can buy at Costco for .25 cents.  But Rise & Shine was really different. It appears to be a former bar and grill and perhaps it still is at night. But at breakfast, the menu was inventive and healthy with great options that don't have to weigh you down.  I had a great steak everything bagel sandwich and fruit that was prepared perfectly. My wife and son had kale smoothies that were actually good along with other items.  We also had some oatmeal that was prepared perfectly and I think from steel cut grains not instant.  Forget about the chain restaurants with egg in the name, drive out a little further and enjoy a far better breakfast.  They also have a nice and comfortable patio for those who prefer to eat outside.",

The servers wear pajamas and the ceiling has cool umbrellas and did I mention the pot o'bread?  It's basically a cinnamon sweet roll served in a cup with cream cheese frosting on the side and it accompanies most breakfast dishes here: delicious!  I usually get an omelette to go along with my bread, but I'm also a fan of their corned beef and hash.  Although this place does get busy, they have an outdoor patio for more seating and the wait on the weekends is usually a lot shorter than other breakfast joints.  We just dined here today, a Sunday, arriving around 10:30am and only had to wait for 10 minutes or so.  The staff is always so pleasant and very attentive to your needs throughout the meal.  Definitely a winner in our breakfast dining book.",

But if you like it pink, get it rare. It's a thin steak so it usually comes out well done. I don't think you can really fo wrong with anything you order here.   They do get busy so you may have a long wait on weekends so be prepared. With being busy, comes not the greatest customer service. Everytime I've gone, it's been hard to get a hold of a server anytime we needed anything. One thing I wish would be better, is the time it takes for the servers to check on you. Still worth going to tho.",

The potatoes which were so amazing last time today were so overcooked and greasy.  My friends breakfast was equally disappointing.  The waitress was so annoying she was rushing us along I was halfway through my plate and put my fourth down for a minute and she tried to take my plate away?  Oh well it's a shame the food got so bad so quick.  Probably won't be back here anytime soon.",

    "text": "With a wink and a nod to kitsch in both menu and design, my recent trip to breakfast spot Rise and Shine managed to entertain and disappoint on many levels. I dined with two other guests, ordering the New York Steak, Spinach, and Benedict Bagel.   In a nutshell:  Possibly the worst hollandaise I've had in ... well, ever.   My guest had ordered the smoked salmon benedict and had the same reaction. It lacked all the classic hollandaise flavor notes, almost as if the sauce broke and they opted to serve it anyways.   Cloying balsamic reduction drizzled all over my steak wasn't listed in the menu description and muted an otherwise perfectly cooked, well seasoned New York Steak.   Spinach wasn't cooked for some reason, not even blanched a bit.   My other guest was also straddling the fence on his dish. He had perfectly cooked eggs with his giant bone-in country ham steak breakfast. Our eyes lit up when the ham arrived with those beautiful cross hatch char marks from the grill. But the cost of those char marks was a very dry piece of meat that he ultimately left behind.   On the plus side, damn amazing pancakes. Fluffy in height yet dense with flavor, spiced with cinnamon and topped with a cinnamon syrup. It was a good thing I saved it for last so I could end on a high note. Honestly, if I came back I'd be all over the griddle menu.  Kudos to our waiter who was friendly and quick to offer up refills, checking in often.",

However the service was so bad, it was almost comical. My food and my children's food came out but we weren't given any utensils or syrup. Our server never came by so we had to get up and ask someone else for help. They told us we couldn't have utensils until they were wrapped in napkins. We again asked politely for at least 2 forks for the kids. We were told no so we simply took the forks ourselves (about 10 minutes later someone brought us over utensils wrapped in napkins). We never got syrup so we had to ask the booth behind us if we could use theirs. My mom's food came out a few minutes later, but her side never came. When we got the receipt her side was still on there so we got them to take it off & mentioned our bad experience...they gave us 10% off but really a few dollars off didn't make us feel better about the situation. As we were talking and standing up to leave another family heard us and said \"you didn't get any utensils either?\"   The food is not bad so if you don't mind waiting forever for everything and having to hassle everyone for things then don't let my review discourage you. But if you have kids or a tight schedule (or just want to be waited on) then this is not the place to go.",

I'm soo glad I wore stretchy pants coz my belly is 9 months preggo of waffles, egg, sausage and potatoes. The French press coffee was impressive. 5 minute press was stronger than my partner's farts but in a good way! Let see, what else? Our server Madison was very attentive and pleasant. She's got really nice teeth too. And quite pretty, even in her pajamas! Over all, good freaking job rise n shine. You're 5 stars in our book. We will be back as soon as we're out of our comas. K? K!

We hosted a bridal brunch here around 1 pm on a Saturday. They were helpful, so kind, and very well organized. Some places just give you a bad attitude for having a large group. But they served all 35 of ladies with big smiles on their faces. We RSVP'd ahead of time, and when we got there to set up- the tables were ready to go. I know we were blocking the paths sometimes and I apologized to one of them and she said \"no, don't be sorry. This is your guys party!\" How sweet is that?!?!

I like that all the employees are wearing pajamas. They little umbrellas hanging of the ceiling are cute too. The place just has a really nice country breakfast place feel. I really enjoyed our waitress and she called us hun and baby. It was just a very welcoming and authentic staff.  The food was good don't get me wrong. I order the steak omelette and I am really picky about the way steak is cooked and prepared, and they prepared it very well. However, I just feel like something was missing in the food and I don't quite know how to explain it. The menu is so big as well that I always am trying to pick what to order! However, I will say that the pot-o-bread is freaking amazing. I love the little sweet things. I like to experience sweet and savory during breakfast, and maybe that's what was lacking but I had some chicken and waffle and was a little dissapponted in how the chicken was cooked. Still a good chicken and waffle just need to be less breading and more flavorful chicken.",

My sister and I ordered the ultimate I believe. It came with these cute cinnamon bun pot breads with cream cheese icing. They were very tasty. Once we got our breakfast we realized that we could have shared. It was worth every penny and its not really expensive. The steak was perfect.

Flowers everywhere! The staff are dressed in pajamas, which is fun, and they are so friendly.  The restaurant was also busy which is a sign of good food :)  Anyways, it was very difficult to make a selection but I finally settled on the pancakes. However, these were no average pancakes. They were huge!!!! Also, they tasted like cake. We asked the waitress what they were made out of... SWEET CREAM pancake mix. So delicious!!!!!  The service was wonderful, the food was marvelous and the atmosphere was perfect for a casual morning. Will definitely go back if I ever find myself in Vegas again.",

To start things off the wait I was told was 15-20 min and I waited for 35-40. Second they bring out one persons dish while all of us sit there and watch her eat. Third the wait for our food was at least an hour. Fourth they bring my food and half of the food was cold while the rest was just barely warm. Also I had someone order the steak salad... she got 4 small pieces of steak and was extremely disappointed... don't know if I'm gonna keep going here if they continue to raise their prices and give less and less food.",

But, there were a few things that it didn't make 5 stars: They served this cinnamon covered roll in a little metal cup. The dough was completely raw inside the cup and inedible. This is supposed to be one of their signature items. The coffee was tasteless It's supposed to be Lavazza, if it was, someone didn't know how to brew it and they charged you extra for the coffee, Maybe it's a LV thing? Most places I've been to include coffee with breakfast. Also the prices were through the roof. I've paid less for breakfast in Manhattan...",

    "text": "My first trip to Rise and Shine was to their Southern Highland location a while back.  We loved it and were in there often until it started getting so packed you can never get in there.  I was sad about the traffic but what can you do? That place was so good ... great breakfast and great service ... that it deserves all the demand!!  I was excited when this location opened!  But my first visit was disappointing.  The service was slow and not so great.  I've since chalked that up to growing pains in the new location.    Today's visit has been wonderful and exactly what I remember from my visits to SH location.  I got the Ribeye & Scrambled Eggs w/ their pot of bread.  The PoB is a flower pot or coffee cup with a light fluffy cinnamon bread baked in.  This is so fricken cool and tastes good too.  The steak was perfectly cooked and seasoned.  I also recommend any of their oversized bagel sandwiches.    This is a must visit for anyone up on the west side!!",

    "text": "Sadly, bad experience twice in a row at Rise & Shine.   We ordered a standard breakfast that took a LONG time.  Certainly things can and do take time to prepare.  What is highly irritating is to watch several tables seated AFTER us, get their food BEFORE and LEAVE the restaurant and we STILL don't have our food.   WHAT?  We asked our server where our food was.  She came back and said that the kitchen was working on getting the poached eggs. When it was finally delivered, she was told by her manager (then told us)  poached eggs take 10 minutes.  A poached egg takes 3-4 minutes tops, not 10.   Regardless of the preparation time,  the kitchen needs to plan accordingly to get food out in a timely manner and in order received,  not based on how long things take which is the explanation we were given.  If something does take longer, make sure your customer knows that.  But, eggs take longer?  I would assume a large portion of their items contain eggs. What about simply acknowledging the error, apologizing and making it right?    Excuses add fuel to the fire.    The bill had coffee removed and we were given a $5.00 coupon toward our next visit.  While that was kind, management needs to fix a problem when it occurs, not wait until \"next time.\" The manager also should have been proactive in coming to our table to discuss.  Our server was kind and the food good ~ none of this was her issue.   Want a happy customer? Make it a great experience!  This was not the experience we were looking for.     Cute place!   Needs better customer service before spending your time and money.",

Medium rare, over easy eggs. It came out perfect! Nice red center, juicy steak. Eggs were exactly how I wanted and the hash browns were nice and crispy. I usually never get steak and eggs but so glad I did.    My husband got the ham & eggs (eggs sunnyside up) and this too was great. Nice portion of the ham steak.    Our adult son got the Bananas Foster waffle and a side of crispy bacon. Usually when a place says you get ice cream with your waffle it is a little scoop. Not here! A HUGE scoop of ice cream and some whipped cream topped the bananas foster waffle.  He said the orange zest was a nice touch too. Nice crisp waffle. And he was really pleased with the crispy bacon; all you have to do is ask.  Our server was fantastic, came by numerous times for coffee and water refills and to see if we needed anything. When he brought our check he brought our boxed up Pot of Bread (still smoking hot). We will be back to try other things on the menu.",

The place is very roomy plenty of tables and booths, the decor is nice there are parasols of various colors hanging from the ceilings a very nice look. The menu had numerous selections for breakfast, steaks, ham steaks, chicken fried steaks, rib eye steaks, omletes, traditional bacon and eggs.  We had the rib eye and eggs, comes with hash browns and toast however they have an item called \"bread in the pot\" it's a small hot cinnamon roll in a small cup with butter it was hot and delicious.  Our servings were nice large portions with 3 eggs.  My wife who is a coffee lover, said that their coffee was Outstanding.  They offer French Pressed Coffee too, somewhat of a nice different approach and they have a juice bar and all the juices are made right at the bar...the juice bar also makes smoothies to order.    Breakfast is breakfast... there are numerous places to eat in this area, I would highly recommend try this one and compare to the others, this will be on the top of your list. The staff was very friendly and very attentive to our needs and well versed on all the items on the menu.  They also serve a lunch and have a very appealing lunch menu, I'm looking forward to trying it out.",

They have a large variety of breakfast choices in their menu and the portions are large. They also have freshly squeezed juices and smoothies.

    "text": "So this location just opened around the corner from my house. Being a breakfast lover I had to check it out. Still in the soft opening phase but things were running fairly well. I got my breakfast, side of fruit and toast in 3 separate deliveries for example. Not too much delay and the food came out hot so not a big deal. One minor snafu as I asked for no onions and had to send it back. Normally that would annoy me but the waitress was sweet and understanding about it and I got a new omelet quick. May not sound like it bit I felt the service was good and will only improve.  So the food. I ordered the fancy steak omelet and it was delicious. Steak was perfectly medium rare and the omelet was well prepared. Side of bernaise sauce was delicious and a great compliment. Lots of fruit as a side and the hash browns have great flavor. One pet peeve I have to mention. I hate when places don't butter your toast! Haha silly to some but I want it buttered right out of the toaster so it melts into the toast. Being that this was my only.comolaint about the food though, I highly recommend this spot and look forward to going back.",

I have always worked in food service and I'm very understanding about these things.   After 45 minutes, we checked on the status. The hostess said there was one group ahead of us and she would come outside and call. They weren't calling anyone, we saw her come outside maybe once.   Finally, after an hour, I went back in. Our name was crossed off and the hostess tried to tell me that that wasn't us, it was a different party. Funny though, that's where I remember her writing us down and our name wasn't anywhere else on the list.   She did not apologize or own up to their mistake, and this is what bothers me the most. I wasn't angry about the situation until she did that, if she had apologized and owned up to their error I would have happily accepted the table that they rushed to set up for us.  Instead, we left. I will never eat here on the basis of that alone, as clearly the staff isn't trained with good customer service skills and would sooner lie to a guest than remedy the situation appropriately.",

I had \"Rise and Shine Chilaquilles\" which was like breakfast nachos and AWESOME. My over-easy eggs sat on a pile of tortilla chips soaked in ranchero sauce with refried beans, cheddar and cotija. I'm already planning a return trip to eat it again. My friend had \"The Ultimate Steak and Egg Breakfast\" with a big ribeye cooked perfectly, two eggs and hashbrowns. We both had the \"Pot of Bread\" which was an ok cinnamon roll. The icing served on the side was the best part. We also shared a French press of coffee, which was delicious.  Not so great: the hollandaise was way too buttery.  It's not a classic hollandaise. (We got a side of it to try).  I asked about the bearnaise (served with \"Fancy Breakfast Omelette\"), but according to the server it doesn't have much tarragon in it, which is the essential ingredient in a classic bearnaise.",

Very roomy and spacious with a great outdoor area with pretty flowers in the ceiling. Great for brunches and breakfast dates.   2. Service: Since I tried this place during it's \"soft opening\" I don't think it would be fair for me to give an evaluation on it yet. But the staff was knowledgeable of the menu and gave me a great recommendation.  3. Food: O M G! I know Rise & Shine is a Steak & Egg Place but for someone that's on food rehab you can't always indulge in pancake and eggs.  The item I ordered was the Salad (with bacon, avocado, and chicken) and it was *aaaammmmmmzing* I mean, a salad is a salad, but their ingredients are fresh and the bacon is to-die-for; perfectly crispy, not too greasy, oh so nummy, f*** food rehab. Everything else in the salad was good, dressing was a bit tangy for my taste but THAT BACON!",

We were seated immediately, our waiter was at our table within 30 seconds and we had our drinks within a couple of minutes. My son ordered the apple juice. Our waiter commented that they had a juice bar. I dismissed it, thinking that's what they called their concentrated juice machine in the back. My son said the juice was really good, so my husband ordered a carafe of orange juice with two glasses. I told him no thanks as I can't stand sugary restaurant OJ...but when the waiter said they had a juice bar (which actually was visible, but my head was buried in the menu) he meant it. I would come back here just for the juice. It was amazing! My son ordered the Ribeye and eggs, my husband ordered the country fried steak, and I got the chicken and waffles. The chicken and waffles were delicious - chicken crispy on the outside, juicy on the inside and just enough peppery seasoning, waffle perfectly cooked, tasted great with the syrup on top. I tried my husband's country fried steak, and it was delicious, the gravy wasn't too thick or too thin, just right, and tons of flavor.  My son refused to share his, so there you go. Our server was attentive and friendly, in fact the entire staff was friendly. So nice to see a place that tries hard to keep our business. We will definitely be back.",

If there is one thing they could improve on would be the service it was a little slow and not as helpful as you would hope for with it being our first time there. But I am going back a few more times it might be my Sunday morning spot. Highly recommend!! They only thing that would make this place any better is if they had flavored cream, like French vanilla etc, for coffee.",

They put the gravy in 2 cups on the side so you can add as much or as little as you want. Sister ordered the rib eye steak which was moist flavorful and melt in your mouth. Ambiance was nice and wait staff wears pajamas and are tentative to your needs. This is the place to have breakfast in Las Vegas.",

We decided to split 2 entrees since their portions are huge! The menu is extensive! You will want it all. They have everything from freshly squeezed/pressed juices, smoothies, to your choice of coffee, espressos, lattes, (they serve LAVAZZA coffee) yes please!  I ordered the \"Go-Go\" Green juice. (Kale & cucumber) it was perfection! Super refreshing!  On to food, we split the  Egg White - Avocado - Steak omelet: Amazing. Steak was cooked and seasoned perfectly, sliced on top, along with avocado slices.  Belgian Waffle w/strawberries: Came with whipped butter on the side and a cinnamon, butter, maple syrup.   Everything was great. Service was friendly and efficient! I will definitely be returning!",

This place nickel and dimes you for everything, they charged $1 for a small side of ranch.  So while the food is incredibly tasty, it's just not worth it for the price.

The pot of bread was unique...a cinnamon roll baked in a small coffee cup with a side of butter and cream cheese glaze.  Mine came out hot of the oven, so of course it went down the hatch with no trouble.  Omelet and potatoes were also tasty.

We waited (four of us) for about 20 minutes (arrived at 1:15 on Memorial Day) and ended up at an outside (non covered) table.  Thank goodness the desert heat hadn't started yet and the clouds from Mt.Charleston were drifting over us as this would not have been acceptable.  In fact..for Las Vegas..you can have outdoor dining but it really should be 100% covered.  The hostess took our drink orders and served them promptly, but had to wait too long to place our order.  But the reason why I didn't give this place a 5* rating was because it took so long to get our 3 (2 adult and 1 child) meals!  Way.  Too.  Long.  It took almost 45 minutes!  Plus, I had to ask the hostess for water and coffee refill at which she quickly (the only speedy part) did and felt bad about our wait time and comped us 2 more apple juices for the kids.    The food finally arrived and all very good: Buffalo style chicken breast and eggs, build your own omelette and silver dollar pancakes for the kids.  In fact..all the food was so tasty and plentiful..but the wait was too much (albeit nothing arrived cold).",

Just the right amount of marbling to give the ribeye a great flavor. It compared to some dinner menu ribeye steaks at some fine dining restaurants I've dined at.  The chips were a little salty for my liking, but still delicious! My girlfriend had the Southern Style Chicken Fried NY Steak, which she enjoyed also. The house coffee had a nice fresh taste also. There were several healthier menu options we will try on the next visit.",

    "text": "Delicious food. Good variations on standard breakfast items and the waitresses are attentive and friendly.  The one big issue I saw (and one that almost had us walking out in the first 5 minutes) was the young blonde hostess. What a disaster. We get there with children in tow at 10am on a Friday morning (not even a weekend) and we were immediately greeted by someone who seemed frazzled and a bit stand-offish when asked the wait time by saying \"I know that I have a ton of tables open but I don't want to slam the kitchen so I need you to wait up here for 10-15 minutes\". You clearly had the staff and the tables free yet she was ill-equipped either by training or lack of common sense to seat us immediately. Then she begrudgingly seats us and then asks if we need a booster seat. We say yes and she says \"Can you wait here at the table and I will be back in a few minutes as I need to cash these people(who just walked up) out\". So I got my own damn booster seat and we sat down instead of waiting for her to bring us one from across the restaurant. A horrible impression.  The young lady is not hostess material and she certainly is not a good first line for your restaurant. She is better suited for the tanning place next door.  The food was great. I had the Salmon Benedict and everything was very tasty. Our waitress was very attentive and pleasant. Overall a good experience until we go to pay the check. The hostess asks if we want to add a tip electronically and we say yes and the amount and then she prints us out a bill with $0 added to the tip. Again, might be a serious lack of training or she might not be a good fit but the coming and leaving from your restaurant was unpleasant at best.",

I ordered the spice rubbed rib eye chilaquiles, the flavor was amazing and I got a colorful mixture. The squeezed orange juice was great. The waitresses and all the staff had the place going like clockwork, things ran smoothly from what I observed. I recommend this place for sure. One small thing, I must have misunderstood the menu; for I had three squeezed orange juices and I didn't see anything about being charged each time for an orange juice.",

Drove pass this place on my way to bite one sunday and had to look it up on yelp! after reading reviews of my fellow yelpers i decided to check it out. the decor is cute the servers are all in pajamas. They have a lovely looking patio area which would be great when it starts warming up out. The inside is huge plenty of seating. The menu has some basic breakfast and sandwiches options. as well as some custom stuff. I recommend the buffalo fried chicken. The bread in a pot is delicious so soft and fluffy not overwhelmingly sweet. The service is alright they don't seem to like when you say you are sharing items though and you have to constantly remind them for little things like sugar, utensils, and creamer.",

We come in and greeted by the hostess and we requested booth, she says all the booths are dirty right now we will get it cleaned, it took about good 10 to 15 mins wait, even all the booths are clean and one is dirty. I stood up waiting from the waiting area and this server Sarah came up to me, all the booths are still dirty and I will clean them up with the attitude and negative vibe I got for her. Next thing u know she went back to the back to get a rag that took her a while as well. Me and my BFF went to the table that she said she had cleaned, but it's still pretty wet when we had seated. I ask her a napkin so I can wipe the table off and she had took few steps ignoring my request and turned around and said ok. My BFF can already tell tht I am not happy with the customer service In this place, so she had went up to the customer and told her the story. While my friend is talking to the hostess, I had gathered our stuff went to the counter as well. We are pretty disappointed with the server \"SARAH\", because she was very rude and not an inch of customer service skills she had. While talking to the hostess and Madison (manager) the server still yapping at the back of course prolly about us. I had a good experience here at the first visit my sister brought me there. I had brought my BFF there so she can try the place, but after that experience with that server \"SARAH\", I feel disgusted and just lost my appetite. Thank you for the manager Madison for handling the situation very well, but I hope u guys talk to SARAH on how she can improve her customer service skills. Goodluck!",

The wait was about 15 minutes as promised. the house was packed so I was thinking this must be a really good spot. We asked what our waitress recommended (which by the way was wearing PJs, how FUN!) for us first timers and she recommended the ultimate ribeye breakfast and a side of pancakes for us both to share. We ended up ordering just that but the red velvet pancakes. OMG. The red velvet pancakes are to DIE for. Chocolate overload. And the ribeye was cooked to perfection . Our over easy eggs were perfectly runny and the potatoes had so much flavor. A new favorite for sure. We will be back soon, maybe even next weekend",

We were seated inside and it was a nice scenary.  I got the bottomless coffee. I was disappointed because when I see bottomless I expect my mug to always be full!! They only served my mug twice! What a disappointment.  I ordered the french toast with the platter. French toast was fluffy and tasted okay. Nothing special. The eggs and turkey kielbasa were okay as well. Again nothing special.  When checking out the line was outrageous. Only one cashier, I hope they open at least 2 people at the register!  Overall service can improve and food was just okay.",

Our food came out in a timely manner and everything was cooked to perfection. I am not going any other breakfast place ever again.

I hardly have to wait for a seat because I usually go with just my girlfriend. If you have a bigger party you might have to wait. If there's one thing I would suggest you try here... it's the chicken and waffles! They use chicken breast and it always comes out amazing for me. I love how it's crispy and goes well with the waffles. Their syrup is really good and they try to keep it warm at all times. As far as pricing goes it's your usual $10+ price range for almost any breakfast spot. The staff is super friendly and the establishment is clean. I see myself coming here again.",

    "text": "What a great place for breakfast! I went there two days in a row, and the hostess remembered me!  The first time I went I ordered the ultimate steak and egg breakfast. The steak is a ribeye, a bit thin, but was delicious. It took up a big portion of my plate. The eggs are cooked perfectly and the hashbrowns are large shreds instead of small shreds nice and crispy on the outside tender on the inside.  The second time I went, I had the buffalo chicken with eggs breakfast. Now buffalo sauce for breakfast didn't sound great to me, so I asked for gravy instead. The size of the piece of chicken fried chicken I received was huge. It overtook my plate. I could only eat about a third. The batter was wonderful! I think this is the best fry batter I have ever had. It was light and crispy, not oily or greasy at all.   It had a little little flavoring of the buffalo sauce and the better, and that was just right. I think I might order it the next time as presented on the menu.  They have a lot of nice things on the menu, including a many different kinds of pancakes (mmmm..chocolate chip!), original omelettes such as lox and cream cheese, or you can make your own. They also have French toast and The  normal breakfast fair.  They offer a different variety of sausages for your choosing. Not just the patty or regular pork sausage. They offer chicken sausage and another type that unfortunately I can't remember! If you have a chance, get online and look at the menu. There's just so much there I can't describe it all!  The servers are all dressed in pajamas, so you can tell who is a server and who is the patron. The service was great by the way.  They offer French pressed coffee which I ordered the second day, and let seep a  little too long. It was very strong. They give you three timers, so you can decide whether you want it mild medium or strong. I normally like very strong coffee so I went for it.  Next time, I will choose a different timer.   There are lots and lots of breakfast places here in Las Vegas, for me to go to the same place two days in a row, that pretty much says it all. I love to eat breakfast out and plan to try just about everything on the menu there.",

Parking was easy, plentiful. As soon as we came in we were seated right away at a four top table. The servers wear pajamas which I thought was pretty cool, GET INTO THE SPIRIT!  The decor has a farm-country like atmosphere with bright colors and pictures of cows everywhere, can't miss any of them. It's very wide open layout, there's outdoor seating which also looks comfortable. I ordered the ultimate steak and eggs (got them poached) with rye toast, also came with home fries.   It took quite a while to get our order and I got my steak medium rare, was about 25 minutes. My steak was awesome, very little fat and tender. My eggs were over poached, I like to break it over my potatoes and couldn't quite do that because the yolk was hard. Generally when you go to breakfast places its intact and still runny.   Aside from the wait and the eggs everything else was OK. Our waitress gave us good service, she checked on us twice after we got our food. The meal was very reasonable under $30 for me and wifey. The menu was huge so would definitely return to try out something else as there were awesome selections.",

The reason my review is lacking one star is because every time we are finished eating, our server disappears! Three time I've been here, we've needed boxes. They usually drop off the check for you to pay up front. The restaurant is hardly busy when we go (around 11am), so where do our servers disappear to??   Other than that, delicious food!

The manager came out and was very nice but she then said she 100% guarantees no one on her staff would of took them, not sure how someone could make a statement like that.

I ordered the steak and eggs and my husband ordered the the steaks wrapped in bacon and eggs. I forget the menu name. The steaks were good and properly seasoned but the eggs were small and the potatoes lacked seasoning. I didn't like that we didn't receive our toast with our meal. We were 1/2 way done when the toast arrived after we were assured \"it was coming up\". I used the lady's room here and it was very very dusty and lacked supplies. It needs a deep cleaning for sure!! I also didn't like the lack of uniformity of the staff. The hostess' wear regular street clothing, the waitresses wear PJ's, the cooks and busers wear an identifiable shirt and khaki pants. I bring this up because when we needed something we didn't know who to ask we couldn't tell who's an employee or a patron. Also, the PJs worn by some were a bit disheveled. Not very professional. All in all this place is nothing special and the food wasn't great. Stars for decor and some of the food.",

The so called poached eggs were hard boiled and looked like they were sitting in the water for days. The Hash was the worst I ever tried! It was made of what looked like diced pieces of Oscar Meyer cold cuts and diced potatoes that were EXTREMELY OVERCOOKED! It was like I had someone's leftover food. I had heartburn the rest of the day after that.. I recommend that they give up their gimmicky Pajama Uniforms and teach their staff how to prepare food!   NEVER AGAIN",

    "text": "My husband and I ate here a couple of months ago and we totally enjoyed the busy atmosphere, great service, and the food that was plentiful and delicious.  Breakfast for 2 set us back $50+ with tip.  So, we decided to keep it as a special occassion, not an eating out frequently ( as we do) kinda place. Ironically, our waitress told us prices were set to go up soon.  I inquired if we could purchase 6 of the pot of bread to carry out.  She checked and told me $1.75 each, which seemed reasonable.  Yesterday, I invited a friend out for lunch, raving about how great it was.  We arrived, and the first thing I noticed was how empty the place was...I ordered the 3 eggs on top of corned beef hash dish.  I chose this over 2 other selections, located in the same area in the menu, because it included that delicious pot of bread...after asking the waitress how much it would be to order  separately...$3.50! (after being quoted $1.75 few weeks before.)  That was kind of a turn off.  My friend ordered a banana parfait, (for $9.50) it looked, and she said tasted delicious, however I noticed that the cook threw a couple of sliced banana at the bottem of the glass, no pudding, just 2 lonely banana slices at the bottem, and pudding at the top, no layering of the pudding.  It looked skimpy.  My corned beef dish arrived.  Again, skimpy portion, and no sliced potatos, just chipped beef and onions, I asked the waitress and she had no clue or offer to remedy the problem.  Only that thats the recipe, they make in-house.  The flavors were not what I expected, alot of sage, very disappointing.  Oh, and yes, they did raise their prices.  We were so excited for a new place to go and relax, and to take our friends to, and, unfortunately, their clever touches are not enough for us to go back again.  They had a good thing going, but have lost us as customers, greedy pricing, and shorting of food does not keep diners.",

From that moment on, she had no interest in service at our table. It took more than 10 minutes for the two of us to place our order, because she simply did not come back to the table. When the food arrived, my omelette was overcooked and rubbery. I had planned to send it back. But Laura never returned. She eventually walked by and dropped off the check but did not ask how everything was. We needed a to-go box and did not get one. When I shared this information with the manager on duty, she did not really seem to care about it. Said Laura was one of their top three servers. I said that made this even more unacceptable! If you want average food for an average price, with less than average service, check it out. But too many breakfast options in Vegas for me to come back.",

It was very firm and over cooked. It also seemed to lack flavor so I found myself using half the pepper shaker to make it more palatable. Yes the pot of bread was good but I really wanted a nice omelette. The service was okay except for the cashier, not so friendly. The restaurant itself has a charming atmosphere and is decorated lovely. But if you want better prepared food then I would take the drive to their Southern Highlands location- your food will likely be much better. Or try The Original Pancake House. Now,  go relax and have breakfast or brunch!",

The waiters/waitresses wear pajamas!!! How fitting for the restaurant name \"Rise & Shine\"! Love it!!  We were a party of five and all of us ordered something just a bit different.  Myself, I ordered the kids + seniors special, 3 pancakes with two strips of crispy bacon and one scrambled egg. Such a deal!!! Wouldn't find this deal where I live.  The pancakes were amazing and the bacon yummy and cooked perfect.  Even my scrambled egg was cooked perfect.  My DH ordered the same, but upgraded his pancakes to the velvet pancakes for an extra dollar.  Omg they were sooooo tastey!  For coffee they even serve \"French Press\" coffee if you prefer.  Wow!  In my town, this is only served at the finer restaurants, not a breakfast spot.  When the waitress brought the carafe to the table she also brought a three sand timer so I could time and choose my own strength of coffee.  My daughter ordered the French toast and it looked amazing also.  The wait staff were so friendly.  I will post photos of three of our meals.  Definitely will go back next time we are visiting family, and will be spreading the word to friends who have second homes in Summerlin.",

The service was extremely slow and the food was just so-so, not worth the wait.   Maybe it was a rough day or something because a manager came out to thank us and the tables around us for our patience. I think we would have been more understanding if that comment had been made in the course of our meal instead of at the end when we were settling our bill and frustrated. It wasn't a very good first impression and I don't think I'll be back.",

For a family of 3 we spent $50 before tip ordering two of the ultimate steak and eggs and silver dollar pancakes for our child and orange juices. Second trip- Vanilla latte was great!   They offer a potted bread which is a cinnamon bun in a cup with butter and icing on the side which I was thrilled about! Ask for the icing though. It was delicious!!  I wasn't a fan of the hash browns, a little underdone with no taste I suggest offering a substitute other than tomato and avocado. Our steaks were fantastic and flavoring was great.   They offer freshly squeezed orange juice which is good but not worth the $5 and NO refills with a tall skinny glass. My kid had more orange juice than I did with her plastic cup so I highly suggest that be changed.   There's no changing table in the restroom so I had to change my infant on the seat next to me. I'd certainly suggest installing that right away.",

    "text": "Really enjoyed my breakfast this past week here. First time and ordered the Ribeye steak and eggs with the breakfast mug bread for me and Hubby had the Chilaquiles with seasoned ribeye. It was a lot of food and we both brought home half a steak. Ordered it medium and came out perfect. Our server was very attentive and kept our coffee cups full. Loved the T-shirt's and socks they have for sale in the little entry way. I think they were $12.00 each and they had some cute sayings on them. We don't eat out for steak and eggs very often but will definitely be bringing my family, even the the non-carnivore, as they have lots of options. Our bill for the two of us was a little under $50 including the tip, but not bad when you consider the quality and portion size of what is given. Won't be a regular place for us on a retired budget but very good for those who like to splurge and indulge a little every now and then.",

The table was a little dirty, however we cleaned it with a wet napkin. The server was very sweet and knowledgeable about the menu and food. I ordered the fresh squeezed orange juice, however it tasted like grapefruit because orange was not in seasoned. My spouse and I got the cinnamon bread in a cup with the cream cheese syrup and it was delicious, not to sweet! I ordered the Lox Salmon Benedict with a huge fruit platter that contained honey dew, cantaloupe, pineapple, strawberries, and blueberries (forgot to take a picture)! This fruit platter came in clutch for my little son who loved it!  The lox was fresh and overall my plate was gone! My spouse ordered the three egg bacon classic and it was okay. Our server did an amazing job, she always checked on us and made sure everything was going well!",

The atmosphere here is very welcoming and we were greeted and seated in a timely manner. My group's coffee and water cups never went empty here! The reviews for this place are hit or miss, but I'm glad our experience was a hit!  I forgot out server's name but she was the sweetest. She called us hun all the time and even joked along with us. She made our experience really fun and comfortable.  My order:  Pot of bread - 9/10 Small cinnamon roll served in a mug with a side of icing. I just wish it wasn't such a small portion but it was really soft, gooey and delicious. ORDER THIS  Loco Moco - 8/10 Beef patties cooked how you like on top of rice. Topped with eggs, SPAM, gravy and teriyaki sauce. The rice was kinda dry and the burger patties were a bit tough but the gravy and runny eggs really saved the day on this one.   Also, the portions here are huge so get your gut ready  All my friends really liked their food. Rise and Shine is definitely on our go to list when we visit LV again",

So.... the coffee was ok, yet, the hash browns were loaded with chives (onions), in fact, they had migrated under the eggs. The toast was dry, hard, nearly inedible, unless you were looking for Melba Toast. Seemed to be a fairly busy place.... but now on my \"never again\" list!! Too bad, but there are plenty of great breakfast places... so no loss!",

Food wait took longer, had 3 refills of coffee before our food came and the steak wasnt hot anymore and eggs were cold. Our side orders never came and server just offered to get it boxed to go. Portion was fairly generous though. Overall food tasted good but it wouldve been better served hot. We noticed parties of 2 that arrived same time as we did, eat and finish way ahead of us. Not a great first impression.",

Their uniforms are pajamas which I think is so cute!! Their food is definitely filling and affordable!! They have a fresh juice bar right in the restaurant!! I was really satisfied with my order!! I got the Rise & Shine burrito I think minus the chorizo since I'm a vegetarian but they do have veggie options!! And let me tell you sis I still was full!! Plus I added pancakes because I was going hard considering it was a little vacay lol!! Our waitress said they were a good size, so I'm thinking the regular size like from the frozen food section!! Nope you guessed it they were bigger, better, & softer!!! Look below because I came with receipts sis!!! I can't wait until I go back to Vegas because I'm definitely going again!! Shout out to our waitress because she made us feel so welcome and gave us options!! I don't her name but she has dark hair and we were talking about wearing pajamas outside because they were $30 lol!! It was the weekend of 4.20.19 on a Saturday!!

    "text": "Rise & Shine - A Steak & Egg Place  What came first, the chicken or the egg?    It really doesn't matter because I'm going to eat both.  Rise & Shine is known for great breakfast steaks and of course, their eggs. I've had their steaks once and have to agree with most of the Yelpers that it's pretty good, priced just right, and always perfect for breakfast.  By the way, they use only USDA prime meats here.  Lately, I have been on an egg kick.  I love eggs and can even notice the quality of them.  Here at Rise & Shine, the eggs seemed to taste a whole lot better than everyone else's.  I have no idea where Rise & Shine gets their eggs, but it's good, thick, and very fluffy when scrambled.  I'll keep my meal small with just 3 scrambled eggs with cheddar cheese, 4 slices of bacon, and a chicken breast.  I call this meal the EBC for Egg, Bacon, and Chicken.  The bacon is okay, the chicken breast is flavorful, but the eggs...phenomenal.    Prices for their set meals is about average compared to the other breakfast joints in town.  An omelet made with 3 eggs with all the carbs cost around $10.  Their steak and eggs breakfast is roughly $15. My meal is usually a little more since I am getting different proteins a la carte. The restaurant is pretty big and very popular during the weekend mornings.  As for their service, it's as good as it gets. I appreciate the fact that they're always willing to substitute items or add extra proteins for me.    2017 Yelp Review #80",

Me and my boyfriend could not stop eating it as soon as it was set on the table. Then I got the ultimate steak plate, thinking me and him could eat share it but there was a lot of food and we were so full. We stayed for an extra 15 minutes because we could not part with the food even though we couldn't keep eating. Overall, amazing experience and amazing food! The strawberry watermelon drink was also my favorite!",

The restaurant was a former Joe's Crab Shack so it is pretty big inside which means if there is a wait it goes by pretty quickly.   I ordered the Bacon & Egg in the Hole French Toast ($11.95). You can typically get half orders of the pancakes and French Toast . The one I ordered only comes in a full size because it is a specialized dish. There is a hole in the middle of the French Toast with an over hard egg in the middle. They also put bacon strips in it. This was the first time I had something like this but I really liked it. I also had a side of hashbrowns and bangers ( English Sausage). The bangers were also another first they tasted less salty then your normal sausage which is a plus for me because I hate salty foods and they hate me too!   This is a breakfast place that is also great for groups since there is a lot of seating with big booths and tables . They also don't rush you out when you are finished with your meal so you can feel free and chit chat just a little bit longer over your cup of coffee.",

I also had the watermelon strawberry fresh made juice. The juice was a bit pricy for the size and you definitely wanna get the carafe if your gonna get the juice so you can get your money's worth. I really dig the umbrellas hanging from the ceiling and the staff was very friendly. Silverware was a bit dirty and my friends steak was over cooked. They did fix it and it was much better. The chicken was moist and juicy and they have some of the best hash browns ever!

    "text": "Wednesday morning in Las Vegas... normally tourists are usually heading to bed and sleeping off a hangover, or possibly donning sunglasses and lounging poolside.  But not this tourist; with family living in town, we left the air-conditioned confines of our hotel on the Strip and ventured into Spring Valley to meet my in-laws here.  Even though we were strong in numbers (7 total), we had the run of the place at 10:00 AM (which is more like 2:00 PM anywhere else in the world).  A bunch of folks ordered coffee in a French Press (which they were VERY excited about), though I abstained for java and got a glass of watermelon & strawberry juice.  After perusing the menu, I decided on the Ultimate Steak & Egg Breakfast, with 3 scrambled eggs and a \"pot of bread\" (looks like they bake the bread dough in a small coffee cup).  The food was very hearty (definitely needed in this town); my steak was perfectly medium-rare and the pot of bread was served with a sweet buttery dipping sauce.  My wife ordered the corned beef hash and was very satisfied with her selection.  Everyone in my party was pleased with their meal, and we (eventually) ventured back into the heat after breakfast.  The service was excellent... our server was very patient with us, answering all our (inane) questions about the menu.  All the staff were also dressed in pajamas, which made me feel very overdressed in my t-shirt & shorts.  Next time, I'll just roll out of bed and stumble into this place!",

The interior is so cute and the waiters/waitresses wear pajamas, I took a star off because there seemed to be some confusion with the service during our meal.

They have spinning upside umbrellas and lights that adorn the ceiling, and all the servers wear onesie pajamas.  The food does not stand out to me, but it is of good quality. I have yet to try their steak and eggs, but the pancakes, the french toast, the eggs, the eggs benedict, the hash browns, and the bacon are on par with most breakfast places. Edible, but nothing I am scrambling to come back for. Portions are typical of a standard breakfast place.  The service, however, was not good. I have been to this place three times, and every time the service has been severely lacking. Don't get within an hour of them closing, as the ambiance drops as employees begin mopping and cleaning next to you while you eat, and the servers stop caring whether you need more coffee or anything. Each time I have been it had taken a good 5 plus minutes or more before even being acknowledged after being sat. Make sure you ask for everything you need when they do talk to you, because that might be the last time someone stops by before your bill.   Speaking of the bill, this place is pricey, especially for what you get, food and service wise.  They do fresh squeeze their juice, and you will pay for it, but it is very delicious. Consider getting the carafe if more than one person at your table is getting orange juice, it will save you a little bit. The servers will not point this out to you.",

My steak was cooked perfectly and full of flavor & by far the best steak I have ever had served with breakfast! My eggs were also cooked perfectly and the hashbrowns crispy and flavorful. I also had a glass of fresh watermelon / strawberry juice & fresh it was! The waitress brought my fresh cinnamon bun thingy in a cup out early so I could enjoy it with my cup of organic black tea (very thoughtful). The food came out very fast. The atmosphere was very hip n casual. The wait service was very very pleasant, professional. Our waitress Samantha S. was the best! Great food. Great service and reasonable prices. Seen there is a location in our new hometown. We'll be back!",

They fresh squeeze the OJ here and it's really good. Food arrived and mine was perfect but the Benedict had runny snotty eggs in it. My wife asked the waitress about getting the eggs cooked better and the waitress said it was the avocado... if the avocado is white and runny I'd have bolted from the place. She finally agreed to take it back and get my wife something else, a Mexican dish. When she brought it we asked about the side of bacon and she snapped, now you want bacon! Um, we ordered it the first time and you forgot it.  My meal was very good ham was tender and yummy",

The place always seems busy to my surprise because at my table we had horrible oily but burnt hash browns. Rib-eye has a decent flavor but the cooks don't know what medium well is. Service was sub par, after your order is put in good luck trying to flag down your server. Also what left a bad taste in my mouth is that when you pay at the register, the cashier there is eating and have their food out while you are trying to pay. The cashier seemed annoyed that we disturbed her and I can't see myself coming back to a place that supports that.",

    "text": "It's always a great morning if Rise and Shine is on your agenda! The name reveals that they specialize in steak and egg dishes, and I have never been much of a fan... partially because I didn't realize how many different variations there were of this dish.  SPICE RUBBED RIB EYE WITH CHILAQUILES: This was incredible. Steak was nicely seasoned and cooked to a perfect medium rare, with a huge portion of tortilla chips, beans, and cheese, along with avocado, salsa, and sour cream to doctor it to your liking. Portion is enough for two, or one, if you don't plan on eating til dinner. CHICKEN FRIED STEAK AND EGGS: HUGE steak, crunchy exterior, perfectly seasoned country gravy. This is the South on a plate. Side it with a biscuit and gravy for the full effect. It's a super-heavy dish though, consider yourself warned. STEAK AND EGGS: The classic dish was also done well. Table agreed the steak on this plate was the best, but the hashbrown potatoes left something to be desired. Would sub for another side next time.  DRINKS: The French press coffee and the fresh-squeezed juices are good choices, the Green Go Go juice in particular (kale, cucumber, melon, parsley).  Service was friendly, love how some of the servers are in PJs. I hear they get busy on weekends, but the food is certainly worth the wait and way better than that other nearby breakfast spot. Note that meals are ~$15/ea, which justifies the huge portions, but may be a bit more than you expect.",

    "text": "They asked me if I wanted to sit at the bar or wait 10-15 minutes. I chose to wait for a myriad of reasons, the most prominent being that I don't like sitting by the kitchen it makes it impossible to talk. Being seated by the kitchen is the worst seat in almost any usual restaurant, so whenever a place sits me near it I tend to not come back. So we wait our time and they sit me, literally, in the table that is the absolute closest to the kitchen without being the bar. Needless to say, I started off my meal highly irritated. Worse than this, the lighting in the area I was in was horrid. I like to take pictures of my food and even my selfie ring light was not fighting the backlight from the windows. I really wish they had more inside lighting,   However, despite my minor complaints with being seated and the lighting, I will give Rise & Shine another shot. The other features of this experience won me back over in time. Our waitress was nice, our food was good (and in some cases exceptional) and I felt really special getting to drink french press coffee. That's a nice touch!   I had the french toast with bacon and egg in the middle and my boyfriend had a fancy steak omelette. The steak on his omelette was surprisingly good. I would even call it great. It was soft, tender, buttery, delicious - everything a steak should be. I don't like their pot-of-bread and wouldn't get it again. If you wanna try some pot-of-bread, do yourself a favor and hit up Jamms!  Coming back for the food, hoping for a slightly better atmosphere. But even if the atmosphere is the same and this doesn't end up being my cup-of-tea for a peaceful breakfast - it would make a STELLAR family option.",

This place is fun too...the waitresses all wear pajamas and they sell socks with different sayings  I definitely recommend trying this place out...they are only open til 3pm though so, there's not dinner there but that's ok",

When I responded as such to our server Devon she replied she would \"dispose of the evidence\" I had literally only taken 2 bites out of the steak and she didn't press it any further. When we checked out With Kristi. The cashier she asked how it was and we replied not very good, she just repeated our statement and gave us our change without any other words. When I asked for the manager she said we could speak with one tomorrow afternoon after 2pm. Never coming again. Not even for the chilaquiles.",

The ambiance and the attentive and friendly staff made for a pleasant rainy morning of steak, eggs, and coffee.  I'd love to take a nap after partaking in the ultimate steak and egg. 18oz rib eye grilled nicely  with sides of hash brown, toast, and eggs my way. Breakfast fundamentals, but executed deliciously. Chelsea was also nice enough to keep the tasty coffee topped off which i apprectiated.  I would definitely recommend Rise and Shine for those who admire a good breakfast experience.",

This restaurant is HUGE, tons of seating both indoor and outdoor. We were seated immediately, no wait. The interior is so cute and colorful. and the servers are in pajamas, creating a unique experience. Our server Ashley was awesome! I would give her 5 stars alone but the food was not great. I ordered an omelet with sausage, jalapeno and onion, nothing standout about this... could probably make a better one myself. The hashbrown are where they lost major points. They were literally potato chip shreds. They were sooo hard and burnt, I think honestly the worst hashbrowns I have ever had. The toast was the highlight of the meal somehow, although the butter was not soft. This place is pretty expensive for breakfast and although it is cute and the service was good I was completely disappointed by the food.",

We were checking out the fish tank(Didn't see mermaids) at Silverton and one that popped near by with high reviews happened to be closed for 3 weeks(a little crazy!) so I quickly looked up option B and came across Rise & Shine a Steak & Egg Place... Let me just say we were meant to come here instead of the other place! We had to wait a little while since a few tables had to be cleared out but we had time to look over the menu while we waited so we didn't waste any time and ordered right away... And we were very thankful for the kids coloring papers because our kids were really coloring and we actually had peaceful waiting time it was sooo nice! And our server was really nice and attentive too, I wish we had asked her her name! She is the one with black PJ on:-) Well whoever you were, you were great! Thank you:-)  Anyways, we ordered friend chicken and waffle, Chicken fried steak and kids 1+2+3, all soooo delicious and we scoffed down pretty much all of it no problem! We officially added this place to must stop by restaurant in Las Vegas list:-)",

Large patio is great though, and the place is huge so you should be able to get seated fairly quickly. Lavazza coffee...brewed OR French Press sooo good. Server kept it topped off (thanks G, we thought you were amazing!) Turkey kielbasa v. good, frosted flake banana pancake is worth a try at least once - one pancake and it's huge. Eggs cooked to perfection. The chicken fried steak on a scale of 1 - 10 was a 6, was as big as the plate but a bit on the tough dry side. Going back to try a few other dishes. I'm on the fence with this place for now, am a devout breakfast person!  Update...went back, french toast stuffed with the eggs n bacon - a delicious original. OJ was watery and too tangy...the server warned us though, as the oranges they had were out iof season. Classic pancakes - 2 huge hotcakes so plan to share. Syrup was warmed - nice! They were wearing their PJ'S on Sunday morning...fun idea! Oh and they had steak n eggs on kids menu.",

I arrived with my group around 10:00 AM on a Saturday and waited inside with the 35 other people waiting for their tables. Since it was pouring rain and there wasn't anywhere to stand everyone was packed like sardines inside the waiting area (which wasn't a problem, as no one can control the weather.). I was quietly chatting with my group and was rudely told to \"move away from the counter so people can pay\" by the cashier Braden. We ignored this comment and went on with our meal. Food was great and our waiter was awesome, I believe his name was Roy. He is the reason this review is getting 2 stars instead of one. When we finished our meal we met again with Braden to pay for our bill. He rudely told us he would not split our check and then went on to embarrass us as we tried to figure out the situation by shouting to the entire line of people behind us that he would \"be right with them after us.\". We paid for everything and left quickly to get out of the awkward situation.  Unfortunately he ruined our experience and we will not be returning because we don't feel very welcome. He seemed to be training possibly but was left to handle a busy Saturday morning by himself without a manager and didn't do well at all. I am disappointed in the way he handled our situation and the way he embarrassed us. He should not be handling cashier if he doesn't have the people skills to keep a situation under control without publicly embarrassing an entire family. Hopefully he will continue to learn and will hopefully not do this to anyone else who visits.  I will be sharing my experience with my friends and family.",

I got the Avo-Veggie Benedict and it was incredible, my boyfriend got the corn beef hash and he said his was great too! You can tell they REALLY care about what they are serving their patrons here, which is really nice.  GET ONE OF THEIR FRESH PRESSED JUICES IF YOU COME HERE!! The watermelon strawberry is so refreshing and delicious!   This is definitely going to be our new breakfast spot on the weekends, I hope Amber is looking for a couple of regulars!!",

The girl at the register didn't ask how it was and when I offered up that our service was horrible she said \"well that's okay.\" When I told her I would leave a review online she said \"thank you.\"   We will not be returning as this is not the first awful experience we've had.

I made a take out order for the Smoked Salmon and Bacon Bagel, on an everything bagel for myself, then Red Velvet Chocolate Chip Pancakes, and the ULTIMATE Steak and Eggs, medium rare, and scrambled for the bf.   I got home and opened up his steak and eggs, took a look at the steak, and was very disappointed, I had to do a double take. It was burned on the outside, over seasoned and NOT medium rare. He took a bite out of it and immediately gagged, not only was it over-seasoned, but it was spoiled. It was placed on top of the eggs and hash browns, so the taste of the meat ruined everything else in the box.   We called and spoke to Vanessa, the manager, and expressed our disappointment in the quality of the food. She was immediately apologetic, said it was unacceptable, took our name and ensure that we would be compensated the amount for our next visit. Very well handled and extremely professional.   We were so sickened that we ended up bringing the food back, only to realize that the location we called was the one in Southern Highlands. I was greeted by the manager Analisa at this location. I apologized for the mix-up, told her what we spoke to Vanessa about, and kindly asked Analisa to please take a moment and speak to the manager at the other store, as we explained the situation to her and she'd be able to confirm our agreement. Her immediate response was \"She's busy.\" She didn't even attempt to pick up the phone.   She looked into my box of food, and asked \"well, what's wrong with it? That's medium rare\" even after I had explained to her that it was burned and over seasoned.   She looked at me as if I was stupid for asking her to call another location, and started to tell me that she'd comp the order OR have the food made again, but I'd have to still pay. She told me she needed the card if I wanted to be refunded and so I headed back to my car to retrieve my wallet. When I returned she had already told the cooks to start the order again, even though I did not agree to it. Turns out she was actually able to go back and just void the purchase, without the need of a card, but couldn't even provide a copy of the voided transaction at all. She even said, in a really condescending manner, \"You can come back here and try it.\" My bf heard that and got upset that she was disrespectful, so he said no, that's fine, let's go, after she wrote \"VOID\" on my crumpled original transaction receipt. I walked out, and went to the car, and saw Analisa following my bf out of the door, yelling at him, in front of many of the guests that were dining on the patio.   Extremely disappointed in the unprofessionalism of Analisa, and the staff at this location. Will not return.",

The only reason I didn't put five stars is because our side of toast didn't come buttered and it was kind of stale. I don't know if me wanting the toast to come warm and buttered is weird but I do. Otherwise everything was so so good. OH! also they have fresh squeezed OJ & it was tasty but it cost like $5.. but it was kind of worth it. Highly recommend!",

The batter was eh and gravy barely had any sausage and was very bland. It was fine after a little doctoring up. A bit over priced for what you get and not a lot of flavor. Definitely gonna give this place a second chance to try more things on the menu..",

Yes, pretty basic choices I know, but it's what we're in the mood for! Fries were the skinny shoestring style, not my favorite but they did have a kind of herb sprinkled on them that was pretty tasty",

The idea of all fresh ingredients is great but the execution was mediocre! I have been here several times now and the last visit I ordered Chiliquillas it was as if it sat in the window waiting for the rest of the food to arrive. As a family we enjoy but it is only getting 3 's from me!",

Check it out, you won't be disappointed!!!",

    "text": "We came here after failed attempts at other brunch places: griddle cakes, dw bistro and biscuits 2 burgers were all full. We'll  be back to b2b since we got a Groupon. It was busy here but not bad like the others previously mentioned. The place was really big, especially in comparison to the others and that's why we decided to go here. We came in and it took a little while for the people ahead of us to be seated and when they were the maitre d took a phone call instead and tried to help someone with a misplaced bracelet? Now, why do some  establishments preference people who call to someone who is either next in line or already being helped? I'll never get it. A good business would put the caller on hold. We decided to to sit down at the waiting area because I thought this might be the proper way to get help and plus my arms were getting tired of holding the baby in her car seat. But as you would've guessed, as soon as i sit down a couple comes in and gets help right away. It's s good thing they wanted to sit at the bar, so it didn't take long for me to be seated when I stepped back to the line. These people need to be more aware on who got there first and at least acknowledge that you were. This is our 2nd time here and it seems like majority of 5he staff are stressed out. My server was just ok nothing above average. Didn't ask if we wanted more to drink from our skinny glasses of juice and smoothies, which I do have to commend them for their taste. The ribeye was supposed to be medium but seemed dry at the same time, maybe it was because of the sear. I would recommend medium rare if you like medium. The chilequilas were good and tasty. The salmon on the benedict was too salty but the poached eggs were done just right, especially the yoke. Not too dry and not too runny. And the pot bread is always good. The cooks might be shortstaffed  and rushed and the maitre d and servers have room for improvement, other than that the place is nice, roomy and good for kids and the amount of food you get for your buck is a deal.",

I think their only problem is the atmosphere. They need to light up the dining area better and I think they should put monitors on the wall for sports, news, and the morning stock market.  People like to be stay connected while eating breakfast.  Romans 10 8 But what does it say? \"The word is near you, in your mouth and in your heart\" (that is, the word of faith which we preach): 9 that if you confess with your mouth the Lord Jesus and believe in your heart that God has raised Him from the dead, you will be saved. 10 For with the heart one believes unto righteousness, and with the mouth confession is made unto salvation. 11 For the Scripture says, \"Whoever believes on Him will not be put to shame.\" 12 For there is no distinction between Jew and Greek, for the same Lord over all is rich to all who call upon Him. 13 For \"whoever calls on the name of the Lord shall be saved.\"",

The Loco Moco and Country Fried Steak are great choices. Also, try their French Press Coffee.",
