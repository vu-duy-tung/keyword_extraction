I had a few bites of the kalua pork -- it was okay.. i wish the cabbage and the pork were more shredded. And it was too watery. I like it a bit more dry. The rice that came with was not hot and was not soft either. It tasted like day old rice. -- no bueno.  on another note this place definitely satisfies your hungry stomach.",

    "text": "Ever since my old buddies and I began going to Vegas in highschool with our fake IDs and all (Jesus, that was over a decade ago now......), Aloha Specialties has become an obligatory stop on each trip. It's in the California Casino, which is in North/Downtown Las Vegas. If you've never seen this part of Vegas, you might want to check it out just for kicks. It's usually our desperation stop when we lose all our money elsewhere and need some lower-limit tables to make a comeback.   But back to Aloha Specialties...  If you've ever eaten at an L&Ls or other Hawaiian BBQ joint, you'll feel right at home here. Loco mocos, hamburger steaks, chicken teriyaki, macaroni salad, spam musubis, they're all here. Stick with the plates, and if you want a soup, only pick the saimin. It's all pretty good, and portions are extremely generous. It's definitely no substitute for \"the real thing\" from Hawaii, but it's not as terrible as L&Ls...   Aloha Specialties is a very low-key place where you show up really hungover and collapse all over tables. Trust me, you'll look like an idiot if you show up at all dressed up expecting the usual glitz and glam of \"Vegas\". Everybody is very relaxed, you won't be hooking up with random strangers here (unless you're old to really old locals who don't talk much), and service is friendly without being the slightest bit overbearing.   The ordering system is a little weird, as you order your food in a line, then sit down at any table you'd like, and then they bring you food and continue to bring you things you request afterwards. You'll have to specifically ask for certain things that you'd normally consider \"essentials\". I guarantee you that even if everybody only orders just what they want, you will end up with too much food, which is a good thing. Cash only, folks.",

It's located on the second floor of downtown's California Hotel. Pretty big seating area. Keep in mind it's not a fancy restaurant.   I order the Saimin with wonton. Pretty much it's noodles with kimchi and wonton. Pretty good but not too special. Boyfriend order the Korean chicken and beef and he loved it. We also tried the Spam Masubi, which is like sushi with spam. Pretty good as a appetizer. They also have Hawaiian soda.   Overall a good experience. I would definitely come back to try other dishes.",

I know they got kalua pig upstairs. The kalua pig is flavorful and juicy. Downstairs they got the Ox Tail soup is pretty darn tasty. They pack that bowl with at least 5 big ox tails!! The broth is similar to a filipino dish called Nilaga... so I can't argue about that! It also comes with a bowl of rice.  Definitely will be coming here for my late night Hawaiian grindz...

Parking is a breeze - just use the hotel's self-park. :)   I ordered the Garlic Chicken Combo (comes with macaroni salad and rice), a Coke and a side spam Musubi. Five minutes after our party sat down, we were served! (Probably the shortest time I've had to wait for food in Vegas). The food was BOMB. This beats your typical Hawaiian Chain restaurant any day! And unlike typical Vegas fare from the strip, the cost did not hurt my wallet.  Full and happy? Check. Hidden Vegas gem? Check.  ** Note: This place is not for people who want to go on a diet. They keep the skin on the chicken (both sides) and they smother your dish with gravy (if it comes with gravy).... all I can say is, HELL YES BABY. Just be aware of what you're getting yourself into when it comes to Hawaiian food but other than that indulge yourself in the gravy goodness.   I'm hooked. I want one of these in Los Angeles immediately.  And as my friend Stephen H. would say, \"THAT'S THE SITUATION!\"",

The other dishes had at the table that I did not try was Chop Steak, Mix Plate and Loco Moco- Everyone else seemed to be content with their food. My 6yr old nephew really loved his Loco Moco.

    "text": "I LOVE THIS PLACE!!!  Located on the 2nd floor of the California Hotel and Casino in downtown Vegas, lies this little restaurant.  My fiance and I come to Vegas several times a year, and stopping here at least once during each trip is a MUST!  We come here mainly for the Saimin with the wontons .  So amazing!!!!  They have the best Saimin ever!  Don't even try comparing Aloha Specialties Saimin with L&L as there is no comparison.  We also like ordering the teriyaki plate which has teriyaki chicken, beef and pork with a side of white rice and macaroni salad.  Their macaroni salad is to die for.  Mix their macaroni salad with a little bit of their thick, oh so yummy teriyaki sauce and it's like you have died and gone to heaven.   In addition, they believe in giving you generous portions and have reasonable prices. They have a good sized menu too, with a little something for everyone. Service is always friendly.  The only downside is they take cash only and at times their lines can be long!   And when I say \"long\" lines, I mean lines that go way out, past the entrance to the restaurant.   To ensure you aren't waiting in line I give this piece of advice.  Go before noon or after 2 pm to avoid the crowds.  Yes, folks, this place is that popular!  When you do decide to make a trip, make sure to wear your stretchy pants.  LOL!  :D",

    "text": "With much hesitation, my friend and I found ourselves at the Aloha Specialties Restaurant at the California Hotel and Casino.  He had tried earnestly to suggest another restaurant, but it appears that everyone else wanted their version of Hawaiian food from this place.  We ordered their special - the Hawaiian special lunch plate of pork lau lau, mac salad, tuna poki, and beef (or tripe) stew.  We also added an order of spam musubi and two drinks.  Total - over $15!  WTF?  Whenever I eat Hawaiian food outside of Hawai'i, I always go for the pork lau lau, so I've had my share of this specialty.  With a little shoyu, I took my first bite of the pork lau lau and looked at my friend.  He took a bite himself and knew exactly what I was thinking.  \"This is bad.\"  It was dry, flavorless, and ultimately, I think it was old.  In all fairness, I dug in deeper, aiming for the center and was equally disappointed.  Moving onto the mac salad, this was a shame too.  Again, tasteless.  There was no flavor whatsoever in this mac salad.  Moving onto the tuna poki.  There was chunks of low grade tuna sitting in a sauce.  It was okay, edible and had more flavor because of the marination.  But nothing to rave about.  Thank goodness for the beef stew and sauce.  The chunks of beef had flavor and we poured all of that over our rice.  The spam musubi could use some serious improvement too.  I think they are using the cheap version of seaweed, or maybe it was old.  I just know that when I get a spam musubi or make it myself, the seaweed is a lot tastier and fresher.    The only good thing this time was the free refill on the drinks!  I still gave this place a two star because everyone else was happy with their order.  Then again, they had a chicken teriyaki bowl and it's really hard to mess that one up.  If you feel the need to be immersed in the Hawaiian theme and surround yourself with Hawaiians and Hawaiian stuff, take a walk on over there.  You'll pass by Lambert's Ice Cream, Ethel M Chocolates, and lots of people in Hawaiian garb.  And you'll probably find a bunch of transplanted Hawaiians hanging out there or visiting.",

My favorite is the shoyu chicken with 2 fried eggs and gravy & the ahi poke by far!  Everything on the menu is delicious and affordable.  Everybody has to know about this place..It's a secret hideout where all the locals hang out.  Good, good food at a very low, low price....JUST LIKE HOME!!  Thanks for the load of food!!!

We ordered a variety of plates: loco moco, fried saimin, teriyaki burger, teriyaki chicken, teriyaki beef, and saimin. I am happy that they make their own patties, not the pre-fabricated frozen patties you get from costco. The loco moco brown gravy has a real gravy taste, nothing a package can get you. The teriyaki sauce is sweet and a good compliment to the salty meats it is poured over. The mac salad is creamy and plentiful, but there's always room for more! Only thing is that I was surprised to see the saimin order did not come with fish cake, one of my husband's favorites in saimin.",

    "text": "First understand that if you're from Hawaii, you probably visit Vegas often and always stay downtown (never on the strip).  This sets the stage for what has become known as the \"Ninth Island\": the California Hotel (AKA the \"Cal\") and adjoining Main Street Station (both Boyd hotel/casinos that cater to the Hawaii crowd).  If you've never been to Hawaii before, this is a pretty good cross section of the local community all lovingly united by a constant flow of Bud Light and the chirp of Blazing 7s slot machines.  I'm a Hawaii transplant now living in the Bay Area, so I especially look forward to Vegas trips for the food.   On the mezzanine of the Cal is a small restaurant called Aloha Specialties which IMO has the best local food menu on the mainland.  In CA we're limited to Hawaiian BBQ joints like L&L which pretty much offer the same spectrum of choices.  Aloha Specialties has some of  my favorite dishes:  TRIPE STEW: Pretty good, could use more and bigger chunks of veggies.  Tabasco makes it even better. (4/5) SAIMIN: Not as good as what you get in Hawaii, but far better than the crap they have at places like L&L.  And it's cheap. (4/5) BEEF STEW: Tastes the way I expect it to and don't understand why other places can't make it (see my L&L review). (4/5) POKE: Too sweet.  I also prefer the onion/sesame oil style (2/5)  Like I said, I eat here because I don't get good plate lunches and other local food on the mainland.  One of life's biggest mysteries is why visitors from Hawaii -- fresh off of their red eye flights from the land of Kim Chee II, Rainbow's and Helena's -- will wait in a long line for food they could get back home.  That's Hawaii locals for you.  Gotta love them... I sure do.",

After we ordered I sat down and looked at the time as well as the last guy in line....after eating he was only half-way through after thirty minutes.  It's completely unexpected too because the line wasn't long, it was just insanely slow moving.  Stop having the cashier do anything but take the order and money...they shouldn't be grabbing forks, plates, whatever else, just taking orders and money.  This would solve the problem overnight.  It is so frustrating to get in a line with 10-15 people in front of you (some in groups even) and then move so slowly through it.  Of course once you're committed you aren't leaving because then you'd have to leave the hotel and find somewhere else to go, by then you will be almost through the line!  That being said, the food is actually really good and the price is great.  Portions are huge and delicious.  I went with the Aloha Bento Box for around $13.  This came with spicy korean chicken, some mahi mahi, some sort of sausage and some steak.  All meats were delicious.  The rice was really good and the sauce on it was excellent.  If you can manage standing in a slow line it is very much worth it.  This is 4-5 star food, but the line is just too slow to recommend strongly.",

Great al dente noodles, tasty bits of egg, green onion, kamaboko and char shiu.  Broth not as good as Shiro's but what broth is?  Get it with veggies and, if you're hungry, with won ton.

Even more surprising was the fact they only accept cash. What? This is Vegas. I got the Korean Chicken complete with rice and macaroni salad. I was in culinary heaven until my buddy, who ordered the same thing, found a very lengthy hair in his mac. The staff was apologetic and handled it well. Kind of put a damper on an otherwise pleasant experience though. Heads up if you use the parking garage. You must pay first and then validate at the casino cage. Make sure you have a receipt. No exceptions. The food was good enough to warrant a return (hopefully hairless) trip.",

There was always a long line. And for good reason.  Fast forward to 2011. Hawaiian food can be had pretty much everywhere in the valley. But I'll always have a special place in my stomach for Aloha Specialties. I'm not sure if it's the absolute best in town, but they get the nostalgia star bump.  Rest assured. I'm not reviewing based on memory from a decade ago. I went back to Aloha Specialties about a week ago. I scanned the menu board and quickly decided on the tripe stew. I do love me some tripe stew, or pretty much tripe anything.  I was supremely happy when it came out and lived up to expectations. It confirmed that Aloha Specialties still ranks up there with the best in town. The stew was solidly on par with my other favorite place, Ross J's Aloha Grill. It makes sense because people keep telling me there's some sort of connection there.  One thing that strangely impressed me was the mac salad. I've gotten to a point where I don't eat the mac salad at most Hawaiian places or I'll substitute it for more rice (something that Ohana Hawaiian BBQ offers). The mac salad at Aloha Specialties was actually quite good--just the right balance of mayo and other ingredients.  Great. Now I'm hungry.",

The best thing about this place is that you get some pretty authentic island comfort food, a large portion, for a very reasonable price...  You get in line, order, pay, and then they bring everything out to you.

Don't expect white linens or pretentious food. This place is all about that good stick-to-your-ribs kinda food. Definitely comfort food to the max (probably good for hangovers) Good prices and large portions, what more could you ask for? The plates they use to serve the food are the biggest plates I've ever seen, haha! I wasn't able to finish my meal so I boxed up the left overs. I went during a weekday afternoon. No line whatsoever, so that was a plus. We ordered the SAIMIN, KOREAN CHICKEN and BEEF STEW. I wasn't a fan of the SAIMIN. A bit too fishy for my taste. The KOREAN CHICKEN was very tasty, a bit on the sweet side. The BEEF STEW was awesome! I highly recommend that. I got a side of green onions too which really made the dish. In hindsight I should've asked for a fried egg on top. Perhaps next visit. Side note if you have time or room for dessert, Lappert's is right next door. You'll find all the flavors you'd expect from an IceCream shop based in Hawaii. So Ono!",

We got here just before noon and didn't have to wait in too long of a line to order. This place is CASH ONLY and no coupons are accepted.  The menu has plenty to choose from...combo plates, saimen, spamusubi, loco moco, breakfast, etc. We ordered a large saimen and the teriyaki combo plate with mac/rice. The saimen was good....lots of noodles and tasty broth. The combo plate was yummy also, a variety of chicken/pork/beef with tons of rice and some good mac salad on the side. Portions are large and hey, even if you're still hungry it'll roughly cost you maybe $5 more to order some more!  This is an order at the counter then seat yourself place- the staff here was nice though and food came out fast. Would definitely recommend and return again!",

Aloha Specialties is no fine dining, but I always come back.  I've had the occasional loco moco and poki, but I always order the won ton saimin with veggies.  Having a little container of hot yellow mustard reminds me of childhood eating.  Note to self-get a small.  I ordered a large and had way too many noodles. Oh-traveling tip for you.  Go to Aloha Specialties right before you head to the airport to go home.  Get yourself a few Spam musabi to snack on while you wait at the airport.",

If you don't expect some sort of gourmet meal, this place is the best home style Hawaiian food that you can get.  On par with or even beyond on the island.  They don't over complicate things by adding non traditional seasonings to try to change flavors.  What you order is what you get and that's what I love the most about this place.  Nothing is unique, but executed perfectly.  There's nothing much that I can say about the food because you get exactly what you pay for.   You want spam, eggs, and rice?  You're going to get exactly that.   Moco loco?  Exactly how you would expect it.  Will it blow your socks off?  No.  It's basic food, but made correctly.  That's why people eat here.    They don't serve you so that you can say something like, \"the acid from the pickle cuts through the heaviness of the....\" blah blah blah.  They serve you food from home, made with love.",

I'm lucky that I had an hour lunch, as it is about a 10-15 minute walk from my job. Situated on the 2nd floor of the California Hotel, the restaurant is across fron Lappert's Ice Cream shop. The restaurant is small but can accomodate some larger groups and has a small patio-like eating area outside its doors. The menu ranges from classic teriyaki bowls and mixed plates to some Hawaiian-inspired items like the burgers. On this occassion I ordered the Teriyaki Chicken bowl and I side of mac salad. I ordered my food to-go and walked back to work.   The food does speak for itself, the chicken had a fried chicken-like crust on it which gave it a texture and held more of the teriyaki sauce to it. The portion for a bowl was larger than I expected. I got through half and felt my tummy hit it's limit and passed my remaining food to a co-worker. The mac salad was good, I tend to mix all Hawaiian Mac Salads with the teriyaki sauce though, so I can't say more than that.   The staff is friendly and has smiles on their faces, it made the place seem lighter. I will definitely cone back as I would like to try tjeir Garlic Chicken and Spam Masubi next.",

Came during peak lunch hours on a Saturday and was expecting to wait awhile to order. I was pleasantly surprised to only find a short line, which moved rather quickly. After placing our order, we were given a number and easily found a table.  My teriyaki combo came with steak, chicken, pork loin, and side orders of macaroni salad and rice. Out of the three meats, I enjoyed the steak the most. However, even the steak was just okay. All meats didn't have a lot of flavor to them. They were each drenched in teriyaki sauce, which I wasn't exactly a fan of. However, the sauce definitely gave all three meats some much needed flavor. If you are a fan of rice, this combo had a lot of it. I found the macaroni salad to be just okay as well. I did like how the mayo wasn't overpowering.  I also had the chance to try the kalua pig and cabbage dish, as well as the spam musubi. The kalua pig was definitely much better than my teriyaki combo. It had a nice smoky flavor to it and was tender and juicy. The amount of pig that came with the dish was rather generous as well. The spam musubi was good, but nothing memorable.  Overall I found Aloha Specialties to be just okay. This restaurant might curb your Hawaiian cravings, but for me, it just didn't do the trick.",

Be patient, sometimes the lines are long but you know what they say \"long lines mean it's worth waiting for\" Just start off a conversation with anyone cause everyone is really friendly since majority of the people there are visiting from Hawaii or use to live in Hawaii.   My favorite thing to order is the tripe stew! OMG!!!!!!!!!!!!! It is to die for! It soooooooooooo freakin yummy! To top it off, it comes with mac salad and I always have to get a side order of kimchee.   Price is reasonable!   Enjoy and be sure to thank me later :)",

    "text": "After the remodel the place looks great!  Unfortunately a bit of a downgrade for me.  The other changes just happen to take it down a notch.    With the new layout the lines seem to take forever now when waiting to order your food.  Never used to take use more than 20 minutes or so to get to the front of the line.  This time around it took 30 minutes!  Perhaps it was because the place just recently reopened.  Finally after ordering we got a nice booth/table combo with new furniture.  It was busy so it took another 20 minutes for food to arrive to our table.  Is it just me or did the food get changed up a bit??  My usual order of a teri chicken bowl with mixed veggies and extra teri sauce on the side was NOT the same.  HUGE mound of rice, barely any chicken!!  Like literally a thigh and a half worth of meat.  Used to be at least 2 good size thighs.  Thankfully the teri sauce didn't change, still tasty.  And what, no more LARGE saimin?  It's all one size bowl now?  Luckily it was their large bowls.  But guess what?  The portion is now cut!  We ALWAYS order a large saimin to share at the table for the 3 of us and we always have some leftover to take home.  But no longer!  We finished the saimin easily.  It for some reason didn't taste the same either, broth was light on flavor.  Overall the saimin was light on garnishes as well.  The teri burger and the macaroni salad were still the same however.  I like the teriyaki flavor with the flat top grilled patty.    Other pet peeve with this new upgrade?  The prices!  I know they creeped up over the years but now it is obvious that just about everything on the menu shot up in price.  One entree is nearly equivalent to going over to Main Street Station's buffet for dinner.  Not sure if it's worth it because those entrees that were coming out of the kitchen were chock FULL of rice.  I love rice, but I need something to eat with it!  Expect to spend more now on your next visit to Aloha Specialties.  Biggest problem with me?  This was a bit back around a couple weeks after their re-grand opening but...did no one notice the big 'C' grade from the food inspector posted on the wall??  I mean, it is not is shut down territory but definitely there are some sanitary issues.  I couldn't stop thinking about it.  And after the wifey & kid didn't like the food this time because it's changed, we haven't been back since.  For the money we often end up somewhere else.    Sorry Aloha Specialties, but where has the classic magic gone??  Please bring it back!!  #toomuchrice",

You order your food and pay before hand and the waiter will bring your order to your table.   Mix plate - their chicken was crispy, teriyaki beef was sweet, fish was a bit bland, and the Mac and cheese cold slaw was alright. I like this one; you get to try a bit of everything. Loco moco - lots of rice with omelet and a patty drenched in gravy. My brother was a fan!  3 eggs breakfast - one large egg with rice. For some reason I pictured three mini eggs but they mixed it into one large one. It was nice and fluffy.   Overall I wish I wasn't just visiting, I'd like to try more items on the menu. I never tried Hawaiian food before and this place made a great first impression.   Side note- You can park at the hotel for free if you dine in and spend a minimum of $10.",

    "text": "2016 Yelp 100 Review Challenge -     54/100  I've been a fan of this place for 20+ years. Before I moved here from Hawai'i, every time we visited Vegas, we always made our way to The Cal and ate at Aloha Specialties. In the past few months, we have been eating here every week and it doesn't disappoint. Food is still the same as it was years ago. The renovations are modern and nice. It feels more spacious.   Lately, they seem to have more on staff to keep the line moving. There's still a line and maybe a 10 minute wait at most since this is the most popular Hawai'ian spot in Downtown. But the line moves fast. Now, there's 1-2 cashiers and 2 waitresses, for Saturday afternoons.   They're the sister restaurant of Ross J's in Henderson. One star off for this location. They have the same food but the only thing that doesn't make sense is I can't order the Korean Chicken as a side. I don't eat white rice or mac salad anymore because of my diabetes so it would be pointless to get the plate. Ross J's offers it as a side. If the owners read this I hope they'll consider adding it as a side order. We come here more often anyways because there's more activities to do in the area.   I've tried almost everything on the menu, all are onoliscious (delicious.) What I usually get is Korean chicken, Kim Chee, steamed broccoli and haupia. All are onoliscious. Haupia is made fresh, one time it had a good amount of sweetness, the next week it wasn't as sweet.   Other great options: The Bentos, Sweet & Sour Spare Ribs, huge bowls of Saimin, breakfast plates, Spam musubi, Loco Moco, Kalua Pig and sandwiches. Everything is tasty.   When at The Cal I prefer this place over the cafe on the first floor. Will be back again and again!  TIP: They also sell shortbread and cookies at the cash register. Depending on the wait time, it's worth getting a package to hold you over ;-)  Aloha! :-)",

Service here makes the DMV seem fast. Staff is unapologetic about the appalling wait and service time. People actually clapped when they received their food. After standing in the line for an hour to place the order, it took another hour to receive the meal. The food is fine and is cheap, but if you see a line, be prepared for an unnecessary two hour experience.",

After hearing about the best Hawaiian food at the California Hotel and seeing the pictures of delicious poke on Yelp, we were sold. We didn't have to return our rental car for a few hours, so we quickly drove 20 minutes off the strip to Aloha Specialties Restaurant.   What a disappointment! First of all, we were told that they haven't served poke in about a year. Talk about False advertisement! If you're looking to order poke, look elsewhere. They don't have it here.   Fine, everything else on the menu looked appetizing enough that we could probably still be satisfied sans poke right? Wrong! When we got our meals, no one left satisfied. I wouldn't suggest wasting gas, cab money or calories here at all.",

Examing all the restaurant around, I saw the aloha specialist, looked at my last ten bucks,i went in, nervous, suspicious, I ordered the wonton min, warmth to deepest of my heart, flavor just blooming upon your tongue , oh, did I mention the services? the waitress just like angle, the smiles melt my frozen heart. Satisfied, reenergized. I finally have the courage to pick up my life.  So I went back to casino and lost more money.   THANK YOU ALOHA SPECIALIST!!  CASINO LOSER 4",

Run and managed by Hawaiians it's as authentic as it gets.  The food is legit and I think we've tried practically everything on the menu.  From spam and eggs, Saimin, loco moco, spam musubi, poke, teriyaki items, mahi mahi, salmon, garlic chicken, Hawaiian sun drinks, and much much more. I don't think we've had anything we didn't like. They always give generous portions so it's perfect for sharing. Their plates are literally the size of a serving platter!   They are located on the second level across Lappert's ice cream.

    "text": "Another popular plate lunch favorite is Kalua Pig & Cabbage. Pork is seasoned with Hawaiian salt and slow roasted. In Hawaii, the whole pig is laid out on chicken wire and stuffed with hot lava rocks to start the cooking from the inside. The pig is placed in an imu (underground oven with hot lava rocks) and covered with banana leaves and buried for the day. When it is done, the pig is pulled from the imu and the pork is juicy and tender. At this point, the kalua pig is eaten or stored for later use. Kalua Pig and Cabbage is a great way to use the pork. The rich, salty pork works well with the cabbage when cooked together. The cabbage and pork juice is great on sticky rice as well. Mac salad is served alongside for a creamy flavor.   Teri Beef Sandwich is also a quick lunch stable. The teriyaki flavor was good, but the beef portion was kind of small. One more slice would be better.",

    "text": "Let me set the mood  Its 2 p.m the day after New Years eve.  Me and my boyfriend were HUNGOVER damn near still drunk from the night before (Don't judge We're in Vegas people! ) lol Whats better to eat when hungover than some soup....  Walked in and the line wasn't too long maybe 10 people in front of us...  We're both super dizzy, and its so stuffy and hot in there! No air flow at all...  It took us LITERALLY 45 MINUTES just to get to the register to order. Service is VERY slow  They had only two girls working. Both running out food, and only one of them were taking orders so basically she would take a customers order, and then do about 10 minutes of delivering food and waiting on customers already seated.  Anywaaaaaayyyysssss  We ordered 2 Large 'Saimins' & 2 sodas. The total was $27.   (One Soup is more than enough for 2 people to share)  We sit down, our food comes out maybe 15 min later, we ate a few bites, then I see my boyfriend looking at his bowl with a weird face (Weirder than it already is) haha  Me : \"what\"  Him : \"Is that a \"F***** Bug\"  Yes, Yes its a dammmmmn bug in our soup that we waited almost an hour to order, and eat.  He scooped it out, placed it on a napkin and flagged down the server.   She came, and quickly snatched the napkin out of his hands, crumpled it up, and said I'll refund your food. (as if this happens frequently and she was following a protocol)  Geeezussss...  They refunded his soup, (NOT MINE) even though I told her I no longer wanted mine as well since I was completely grossed out from seeing a bug in his. Our soup looked like it hadn't been touched they were practically brand new I could have sold it to someone standing in line.  Wouldn't come back  I think I'm being nice here and giving 2 stars because I don't want to completely ruin the rating since the flavor of the food is good. But I prefer my meals with less \"Natural\" proteins. Thank you.",

I'd recommend getting the small size. It's already pretty big. Get it with wontons! The noodles is simple really. It's a perfect cure to a long night filled with good memories and alcohol. The broth is very plain yet so crisp it makes you want to smack your tongue. You get a deep bowl filled with crinkly noodles, bbq beef and wontons. The wontons are heavily wrapped with wonton noodle and the meat inside was just divine. Again, nothing about these bowl of noodles will jump out at you and attack you with flavor. It's simple. It's satisfying.  Pair the saimin with an order of spam musubi. It's just a great combination!  Expect long lines at peak munching times.",

My dad was born in Hawaii so we are always on the hunt for some good local food.  Aloha Specialties is one of the must eats when my family or bf comes to Vegas.    I usually get the Garlic Chicken and Ahi Poke (when they have it).  The garlic chicken is a pretty hefty plate with three breaded and fried chicken thighs slathered with brown gravy.  I love anything with brown gravy and I like my dark meat.  Like I said, a heavy meal... take a nap after eating this.  The ahi poke is on the specials list and isn't always there.  If you see it you should get it!  Large hunks of fresh tuna and onion soaked in sesame oil and soy sauce goes great with a bowl of plain white rice.  Better than sushi!  It is always a bummer when they run out or don't have any poke.  My brother is a big fan of their Loco Moco.  Too much hamburger meat for me but he loves it.  I usually get a fruit punch to wash it all down and complete my local style lunch or dinner.  The hours are kinda limited for a Vegas eatery... they close at 9pm or 10pm.  Be safe and come for a yummy lunch.  If you are still on the prowl for some good local food in the wee hours after dancing your butt off at a club, I would head downstairs to the 24 hour Market Street Cafe for some dang good Oxtail soup.  The Cal has it all!  Lotsa good food for a great price.  If you have relatives from Hawaii like I do, you may run into them gambling the slots downstairs.  Say hi to Auntie for me!",

Dining area was full, line was at the door, folks enjoyed their dishes amongst the chatter. I debated on one of the specials: mix of chicken & beef teriyaki, plus spam musubi, but changed my mind last minute to a mahi mahi plate and a side order of musubi. I was in the mood for crispy fish, but the 3 filet portion I received was dipped in something akin to pancake batter. Clean cut white fish went well with dabs of tartar sauce, but wasn't the texture I was looking for. So much rice! Couldn't even finish a quarter of it. Musubi was ok, more sweet sauce than I'm used to. A friend commented the spam was salty in her egg plate. Another friend ordered the pork (soft) tofu, it's a sweetened brothy dish in a bowl. Saimin noodle soup looked good! Lacking meat though.  Lots of Hawaiian options, didn't get to try the coconut haupia dessert because we got Lappert's ice cream across the walkway. Get in line, order at the counter, wait for your food to be brought out. They accelerate table turn around rate by posting signs not to save tables. Polite staff. Grab a bite during gambling breaks, if that's your thing.",

After a night of buffets and losing all your money, this is a really nice place to come to, to end your stay here in Vegas.  Pure Asian comfort food at its best.    Teriyaki beef and chicken, loco moco, soup noodles, spam musubi, curries, and a wide variety of bentos box's and rice bowls, all tasting great, had that home cook taste to it.  Friendly and attentive staff.  The place is clean, simply decorated.    Also a big plus, casino is located just outside the restaurant, for any last minute gambling urges.  Tables are cheaper to play, and the slots seems a little  looser here.  We are definitely going to make this a tradition of making this place our last stop, before heading back to LA.",

    "text": "I moved to the Midwest for college and haven't had very many opportunities to go back home to Hawaii but a recent Vegas trip was enough to satisfy a lot of my food cravings. Aloha Specialties is hands down the number one place in Vegas for local food and was definitely a must-stop for us. I even took some of my college friends here to experience the foods I grew up with and they enjoyed it as well.   The space (a lot like the rest of the California) has seen some needed upgrade since my high school days -- check out those floors and that fancy looking menu board! It's a pretty big space but still always busy and there's a line pretty much no matter what time of day you go. You order at the counter and they bring your food out to your table. The atmosphere is casual but inviting, due in part to the friendly staff and in part to hearing the chatter of all the other patrons. There is something so comforting and familiar about eating here after years of being away from home. Food was a little slow moving from the kitchen to the dining room but we didn't mind at all.   Between everyone at our table we got the kalua pork cabbage, saimin, teriyaki combo, mix plate, and teriyaki steak. Most of the plates come with rice and mac salad. The portions are HUGE and we had a hard time finishing everything. I ordered the kalua pork and cabbage and dat buggah was ono! It was really moist and had a good cabbage to pork ratio. I also tried my friend's saimin which was also HUGE and it was pretty good, the broth wasn't too salty and the noodles were good and chewy. There is also Aloha Shoyu on the tables so a huge plus for that.   It's clear why this one is a favorite for so many Hawaii people and I'll definitely be back on my next Vegas trip!  TL;DR: Big portions, cheap prices, friendly service, good food. My only complaint is the mac salad is pretty bland but everything else is so good that it makes up for that!  P.S. They'll validate your parking here too! If you wanna do the Fremont Street Experience it's a good way to save on parking costs if you're already planning on eating in the area anyway!",

    "text": "(+) Korean Chicken (+) Kalua Pig & cabbage  Every year I play in a basketball tournament in Las Vegas, and I have stayed at the California Hotel for 4/5 of the times I've gone. Therefore, I've eaten here and sometimes multiple times during the weekend. Aloha Specialties is located within the hotel, and my friend told me something about the Hotel being Hawaiian owned, or something along those lines. With that in mind, Aloha specialties is the real deal when it comes to good Hawaiian food.   Food: Oh man, I've had almost everything on the menu. A couple of my favorites are the korean chicken, teriyaki steak, and the kalua pig and cabbage. Honestly, you couldn't go wrong with any entree you choose. The korean chicken is my favorite because it has a kick of spiciness, and the chicken skin is nice and crispy. The marinade they use is to die for. If you love spicy food, try the korean chicken first! The kalua pork is tender and they have always done it right!  The portions are great, but the amount of rice they give you is excessive. If you like rice, you'll like all the rice. :)  Service: You order at the counter, and the servers will bring the food to you.",

With the exception of their newly renovated restaurant.   So they closed for almost 3 months to renovate, and I was devasted during this time. When they finally opened again, I was ecstatic! Keep in mind, I don't live in LV, so for us to come here EVERY time we visit is considered a big deal.   The reason why I'm updating my review is because of Mutya. She's the sweetest employee ever! She remembers our order (maybe because it's so customized) every time I walk in. She's such a hard worker and I get sad whenever she's not here to greet me. She always makes sure I have everything I need especially for my takeout order!  I can't say enough about her and her service, but I hope this business keeps going strong forever because I can't see a trip to Vegas without it!",

They give you a large quantity of food, particularly the amount of rice! I especially enjoyed the mahi mahi on the mixed plate special, the fish was tasty, moist and had a nice light batter with perhaps a little too much tartar sauce. Since we split two entrees three ways I also got to sample my mother-in-law's Portuguese sausage. Pretty yummy.   If you're looking for cheap eats and like Hawaiian plate lunch type fare, you could do worse than Aloha Specialties. It felt kinda similar to Rainbow Drive In in Honolulu.   Four stars.",

This is the Hawaiian restaurant upstairs, right across the famous and delicious Lapperts ice cream shop. I've never seen this place empty, this place is always packed and the line is out the door. I really love their new look, they've remodeled and updated their restaurant with newer seats and tables, paintings are nicer and the service is faster. I also love that their fruit punch still tastes like Malolo brand Hawaiian style.  I normally go for their Portuguese Sausage and Eggs (sunny side up) with a side of Mac Salad... It's the closest thing to feeling like your in Hawaii, ordering from Zippy's or the Rainbow Drive-In. Another favorite is their Saimin which comes with noodles, fish cakes and wonton. They also have really good combo platters, they have a choice of Kalbi short ribs, chicken/pork Katsu, bbq pork, beef/chicken teriyaki, which comes with white rice and macaroni salad. Make sure to save enough room in your tummy for some yummy dessert at Lapperts ice cream and try their tasty flavors like their macadamia nut ice cream!",

Important things:  - it's located on the 2nd floor of California hotel - not sure how much parking costs but if you come late enough there's no charge  - cash only!  - prices: pretty cheap $8-$9 an entree  - order & seat yourself kind of place   Yummm we got the breakfast platter that included rice, luncheon meat, spam, and Portuguese sausage. All were soo yummy! Great place for breakfast! They also have lunch and dinner entrees. They give you a generous amount of rice and it's pretty authentic Hawaii food. They kind of take a while for the food to come out but we were a party of 7 so that might be why, overall not too long of a wait.    Overall, super yummy breakfast ! Great place for Hawaiian food :)",

Good Hawaiian local flavor food here although i will admit ever since they remodeled way back when when they connected the bridge from California Hotel and Main Street Hotel the food quality went down a bit it but still enjoy it. My favorite is the breakfast eggs,rice and Portuguese sausage then the saimin and spam musubi and then the bento box. This place can get really packed around the lunch and dinner time sometimes the line goes out the door best bet is to go off normal lunch and dinner hours regular or Hawaiian time lol.",

Very well marinated, a little kick to it and very juicy! Their Saimin is sooooo good also!  I love the noodles in their saimin.. slightly firm but perfect chewiness to it. Their breakfast plate (Portuguese Sausage Eggs and Rice)... so yummy!  You cant go wrong with Portuguese sausage eggs and rice, ever!  I can do without their Teri beef burger... I dont feel its authentic enough (its a beef patty with sauce thrown on it. No Thanks).   Their portions are relatively generous... so you'll definitely be satisfied!  Staff is friendly, giving it that \"home\" feeling.    Keep in mind that this is a cash only venue.",

The food portions are huge and decently priced. You know this place is authentic when you see an abundance of Hawaiian customers.   I love the food here, but I still haven't forgiven them for making me miss my flight. The day after some qt and barhopping with the bff, he was craving Hawaiian and thought we had time to grab some lunch here before taking me to McCarran. It would've been True if we went somewhere else!!  We ordered our food to-go and waited about 50 mins until we got it. The wait is ridiculous! Of course I missed my opportunity to check in on time and I had to scramble to find another flight. I had the most expensive spam musubis ever that day hahah ($180 for last minute flight to LAX).",

I think all the reviews hit the mark with this restaurant...esp if you're a local from the HI....it's no Zippy's but when in Vegas, will take it.  Staying in the California Hotel aka the 9th island, it was great having a place like this to go to especially if you've been on the mainland for quite some time. Got myself a spam musubi and the aloha bento special...definitely not a place to go to if you're on a diet...was laden with fat, sodium and grease like any good ole spam can and made with aloha.  Just remember, this place is technically separate and independent functioning from the hotel so CASH ONLY...no DEBIT, no CREDIT, and you can't charge to your room..it was also super hard finding an ATM around the hotel and the only one I could find is the one downstairs between the main lobby and the entrance to the casinos.",

We had to wait for quite a bit.  But the line NEVER ran out.  People kept coming!  Must be the food that keeps them coming back instead of the speedy delivery.  Two: you should have pictures of what the menu items are.  There is no way a new customer knows what to order!  I saw some great dishes on other tables that I realllllly wish I had ordered.  But I was clueless.  So research Hawaiian dishes before you go I guess. The food was delicious though.  Very good.",

Chicken curry sounded great but was very disappointed when it took an hour to get my food...which was probably sitting in a pot on a stove ready to be served. This was definitely not the curry I was expecting, especially coming from a Hawaiian restaurant. This \"curry\" was more like a bland gravy with mushrooms and tons of onions.

    "text": "Always a go-to when I come up to vegas since I usually stay downtown somewhere.  Makes me feel like im back home in Hawaii with the food that they serve.  They also have very big portions for a good price too.  I don't know if its because I usually eat here after a long night of drinking, but the food always tastes great.  They also renovated the restaurant not too long ago so it is more modern looking.  The only thing I don't like about the new set up is that there is only 1 cashier and a few workers.  So there were times where it took half an hour to an hour to get order, even quick orders like spam musubis.  Ill assume they go in order of who orders first, but when you have small orders that can go out quickly, especially to-go orders, they should definitely be faster.  With that being said, the line to order can get very long.  Ill also assume that they only have 1 cashier because their restaurant isn't big and if they have multiple cashiers, they wouldn't have enough seats for the customers.  The last time I came here, I ordered two spam musubis and a loco moco to-go (oh and I wasn't happy that the loco moco didn't have any gravy on it). That quick and simple order took more than 45 minutes to fulfill.  I really hope they are just understaffed because that is unsatisfactory in my eyes.   So if you ever plan on eating here, you definitely will get full off of whatever you order, but beware that it might take a really long time.  So give yourself time to eat here.",

We've been going to Aloha Specialties for as long as I remember.  Saimin soup is my go to dish here. Broth is excellent and noodles are perfect. A good soup for a cold night. Yum yum.   Garlic Chicken is the bomb. Crispy and garlicky goodness. Mac salad was on point. I just have to remember to ask for gravy on the side lol.   Spam musubi for the win. Delicious!!  Service is friendly and fast.  Price is reasonable and its CASH only here.   If you're looking for good True Hawaiian food, look no further. You're in the right restaurant =)",

The food was good, but there was a bit of a wait because they were busy.  We would come back if we're ever in the downtown area craving Hawaiian food.",

    "text": "Food: (-1star) Definitely a Hawaiian local favorite. If you walk into a restaurant and most of the customers you see are Hawaiian, that tells you something right?  -Local plate: the chicken was good. The beef didn't have enough of that charbroiled flavor/texture (not enough heat) and they pan-fried instead. Their teriyaki sauce was quite good though. Light yet still holds that flavor and spice in it. Musubi has too much rice but was still quite good. I finished it. Go figure. -Loco Moco: Hamburger meat a bit dry but flavorful. Egg wasn't over soft/medium cooked (runny) like it should but over hard. Over-fried is more like it. So this is main part i didn't like about this dish. Their gravy was actually good and worked perfectly.  Overall, i actually liked this place more than a few places i had in Maui. Just cost alone made me happier here.  Price:  Very descent. Loco moco plate ($7.50) and Local plate ($10) which has teriyaki beef & chicken and 2pc of spam musubi. Their portions are very generous too!  Ambiance: Very casual. As you walk in, seems like a regular dine in pad but you actually go order first and pay, then go grab your own table. They have a water table where you can serve yourself and they will bring you your utensils. Place is clean but very casual like where it may seem unclean and a hole in a wall to some. Generally a laid back place.   I do want to say this place may be more 3.5 than a 4 and not that bad to be a 3. Knowing for the good bang for your buck, portion and i know ill be coming back despite a few flaws, i kept it at 4 stars.",

Well I couldnt pass this place up This restaurant is located on the 2nd level of the California Hotel. After gambling a few nights  I was craving a hamburger steak and boy was I happy with this. The first night they were sold out of hamburger steak and loco mocos and tripe stew. I was so sad so we walked out because I just wanted a hamburger steak. So here comes the next night it was late and I was drunk LOL so i sat down and my mama order me a saimin. WOW that thing is huge and it was so perfect after having a few drinks downstairs. The mususbis was pretty good too... Well here comes Saturday night we had a party of 10 and we all got to sit together we just had a few people sit while the rest got to order. I finally got my hamburger steak this plate is huge it comes with one patty which is a nice size white rice and mac salad. Im a hamburger steak lover thats my go to at most restaurants here in Hawaii. When you walk in you will see the menu on the wall and stand in line and order. Take a number and have a seat they will bring your food to you....The staff are nice and friendly... This is a PEPSI hotel.... BOOOO... Downtown restaurants are all PEPSI....bring the COKE in please... Thank YOU,,,, i will be back soon",

    "text": "This review is long overdue as I've been here more times than I can count, over the years.   The California Hotel & Casino is like the capital of the 9th Hawaiian island, known as Las Vegas. If you're from Hawaii, you know this to be the truth! Take a stroll thru the casino - the odds of hitting the lottery are better than never seeing someone from Hawaii.   Anyway - some locals like to go the California to eat at Aloha Specialties. Somewhat reasonable prices for decent portions. This last visit, I had a bowl of Saimin with won ton and a side of macaroni salad. The Saimin broth is ok but the noodles are a little thick and a little chewy. Won tons - too much dough. I prefer to have more meat filling. A little on the chewy side too. To clarify - not a crunchy chew but bordering under cooked pasta. Al dente.  Macaroni salad - made with too much mayo. I love mayo but if you take a look at my pics, it was like instead of using one entire container of Costco size mayo, two were used.   Walking in - get in line to place your order then find seating. No table service. Your order is brought out and if you want water or refills, there's a water station. I can't speak as to refills as I opted for water.   I know I have posted other reviews that are critical of \"Hawaiian\" restaurants. This one is no exception. Having been born and raised in Hawaii - I'm not a fan of this place and I only went because family was craving one of the dishes served there.",

I order the \" loco moco\" and was not disappointed. It was freaking huge about the size of the bowl  and very Onolicious. Gravy could have more flavor tho. My dad had the three egg omelette and again it was a lot of food to eat. The taste was great and flavorful. Prices mediocre and staff help was courteous and friendly. Only downside is that I believe they might use MSG. (Only my stomach can tell me when it's preset in food, when asked if they use MSG replied no). Other than that it was a great experience and good food. Jafaga808",

    "text": "Its Vegas time again!!!    On my most recent trip to the Ninth Island, I hit three places I want to share.  I finally dropped by here after I started Yelping.  Aloha Specialties is in the California Hotel in DT Vegas.  The hotel caters to junkets from Hawai'i, and AS offers local, casual cuisine.  I ordered the Aloha Bento ($10.95 - Teri beef, Redondo hot dog, korean spiced chicken & mahi mahi over furikake rice).  In addition, I got a side of mac salad ($1.95).  My wing man ordered the chicken tofu saimin ($6.95) w/ wun tuns ($1.50).  The bento was a ton of food!  However, none of the items really wowed you.  In addition, the mahi mahi was buried under tartar sauce.  Nonetheless, its hard to get Redondo brand sausages & hot dogs on the mainland:  3.5 Stars.  Secondarily, the mac salad was excellent.  It was made w/ Hellmans vs Best Foods, and you could taste the difference.  But the portion was so big, I was stuffed afterwards.  I'd rather have a smaller portion of mac salad, and remove one of the proteins, or give less rice in the bento.  There is way too much rice in the bento:  4 Stars.  Lastly, my wingman really liked his saimin.  The portion was large, the noodles were chewy, and you received a ton of wun tuns for $1.50:  5 Stars.  Regarding the ambiance, it is a traditional, casual Hawaiian place.  The only difference is they bring the food to you:  4 Stars.  On the other hand, I thought the cashier was giving me attitude at first, but I realized she just had a \"bitchy resting face\" - a la youtube - LOL!  She was actually nice, as was the waitress who brought our food:  4 Stars.  I know of no better place to enjoy Hawaiian grinds close to the strip.  In addition, if you find yourself in the California Hotel between 11 pm & 9 am, the coffee shop downstairs serves oxtail stew - Ono grinds!!!",

I really love the Saimin (noodle soup) here, the broth has a lot of flavor and the noodles are perfect.  The Beef Stew is pretty good, but I love the Kalua Pig & Cabbage and Teriyaki Beef & Chicken.  Don't forget to try Ethel's Chocolates across the way and the Shaved Ice at the Ice Cream shop.",

    "text": "After spending three days partying our faces off on the strip we were mighty homesick on our last day in Vegas. I heard from my best travel buddy Yelp that there was Hawaiian food in the California Hotel, for anyone not from Hawaii, Vegas is the 9th island and the California is the capital.  I was hoping for a full Hawaiian plate, unfortunately they didn't have that special, but they did have POKE, and it was good! The food was yummy, the rice was cooked right (a must), and the portions were gigantic.  I really loved hearing everyone talking pidgin and wearing slippers, it made the last half of my trip and the freezing weather more bearable since I got a taste of home.",

It's apparently a popular place to go for lunch so it's best to go there early if you're really hungry.  The food comes out relatively quick and it's tasty.  I ordered the teriyaki plate for $7.25 and they give you a good amount of food.  Ask if you can get double chicken or double pork and exclude the pork chop.  The pork is hard and is a pain to eat.  The teri sauce is good and not overly sweet.",

Expect a wait on crowded weekends, especially tournament weekend! Order and pay, and they will deliver the food to you. They bus your tables for you.  Food: I've always loved their saimin, but this year I was sad that my saimin wasn't HOT. It was warm. The noodles were great like usual, but the broth tasted like tap water. Bummer. After I added my shoyu and hot mustard, I was in saimin heaven. We ordered a side of kim chee (pass on this) which was not good and probably out of a grocery store jar and a side of mac salad which was good BUT had too much mayo and was too salty for my liking. The mac salad had good texture, crunch, and color though. The portions are huge! My bro ordered the small saimin and it was comparable to a regular portion at any ramen house in socal. I ordered the chicken and tofu saimin and I think it's served in a large bowl. The chicken was moist (thigh meat?) and the tofu was regular cooked tofu. The haupia was firm but the flavor was bland.  Why four stars? Nothing compares to my grandma's cooking, but if I'm in Vegas, this is as good as it gets for Hawaiian food, especially saimin.",

This small restaurant, located Downtown Las Vegas, has some of the BEST Hawaiian food I have ever consumed. Not exactly heart healthy, but its a definite a cure for your island craving. I have tried nearly everything on the menu once or twice. I highly recommend the Siam-in, which at most places is a miss, but A.S hits it right on. The super bowls are huge and under $5, and the combination plates range but are under $10. The Teri Sauce is like NO other!  I would happily pour it on a human arm and consume it!  But the item that has me coming back (as often as my waistline will allow) is the macaroni salad. I have never been a fan of mac salad, but they made a believer out of me. Sure its loaded with lard and not much else, but its so delicious that the second it touches my lips any weight concerns go out the window. Give it a try, you wont be disappointed!",

Even when its packed, the service is great and you'll get your food in no time. They are cash only, which is fine, just hit up one of the 10,000 ATMs in downtown. Some of the food may be a little questionable (Fried saimin, actually regular saimin that looks like it was fried for a few seconds & the poke which is drowned in shoyu) but I stick with what I know- Teri cheeseburger & a small saimin. I need my combo fix of that since Washington Saimin closed down in Honolulu.. :(",

It's two fried chicken patties, a piece of lettuce, and a tomato. It comes with macaroni salad, which was warm and kinda slimy in my opinion, with very little color. I was not impressed with this meal, but I got all that and a green tea for $5.50, so I can't complain.",

    "text": "I took the Deuce from the Strip to Downtown in search of some good Hawaiian food. Given the hour of misery I spent on the bus, there was a heightened expectation.  Initially I went over to Market Street Cafe at California Hotel, but saw that they were busy. I noticed the sign for Aloha Specialties however, so I went upstairs to the 2nd floor of the California to try this place out.  Aloha Specialties is a very casual place. There are a fair number of tables inside the restaurant with a few right outside on the mezzanine. The offerings here, all of which are cheap would be something you would find at the plate lunch places in Hawaii. Things like Spam musubi, macaroni salad, saimin and meat plates.  I tried the ahi poke ($4.95) which was on special, the flash rice bowl with chicken and beef ($3.25) and washed it down with some raspberry tea ($1.50). My order came out wiki (fast).  The ahi poke portion is very generous. Big chunks of ahi with big pieces of onion and plenty of soy sauce. A very traditional version of this dish. This is salty, so make sure that if you order it that you get a side to counter this. Liked it well enough, though I am a fan of spicy and sweet versions of poke. The rice bowl was cheap and filling. Meats were tasty drenched with the sweet teriyaki sauce. It is reminiscent of the teriyaki you find around Seattle.  If you are looking for a taste of Hawaii in Vegas, Aloha Specialties fits the bill. Good food and service with aloha.",

    "text": "This is our favorite restaurant for Hawaiian food. It's located inside the California Hotel/Casino (a popular place with Hawaiian tourists due to Sam Boyd's longtime marketing specials) in the downtown area, where you park in the parking garage, take your ticket, take the elevators down to the casino, and then self-validate the ticket at the counter. Take the escalators up (2nd floor) to the restaurant. You stand in line (the menu is on the wall, making it easy to choose what you want), place your order and pay, get a number, select a table or booth, where a server brings you your food. There is seating right outside the restaurant wheren you can people watch as they walk by. Due to its popularity, it does get crowded very easily. We've been coming here for years. (Save room for ice cream- Lappert's is across the way- that's what we do, every time.) And just so you know, we've been to Hawaii many times, so we are very familiar with Hawaiian food. I also have a Grandmother from Hawaii.    I've had the saimin (large bowl- I can only eat half of it), korean chicken (spicy, just a warning for the mild folks out there- I've been ordering this dish more lately), and the teriyaki plate (order it skinless, just a tip). The plates come with macaroni salad  (yummy) and a couple scoops of rice. Everything is really good. All the Hawaiian drinks are available (like Pass-O-Guava). It's very reasonable. If you're looking for ambiance, this is not a place for a great setting. (I just wanted to mention that because there are some people out there that love that sort of thing.) It's a simple place where you get really good Hawaiian food at reasonable prices. Also, the portions are pretty big- I usually bring home leftovers. Unless it is crowded, service is great. No complaints here. I don't think that I've had a bad meal here, ever, over the years. They do catering.  The location is especially good because it is not in the super-busy (and sometimes pricier) Strip. It's a gem in the desert.",

I wasn't that hungry when I left the hotel, but after sitting through bumper to bumper traffic on the 15, just to get to downtown LV, I was ready to eat. Ugh, I hate traffic no matter where it is.  Walking through the California Hotel and finally by the entrance for the restaurant, it immediately looked familiar. I had walked by before, just never tried their food. Everything on their menu board just looked so good, we wished we could try it all. But the wife and I finally settled on the Aloha Saimin.  The food arrived quickly, and my eyes widened at how large the bowls were. The Aloha Saimin came with just about everything but the kitchen sink, it had cha siu, spam, wontons, and some other stuff Honestly, I had never heard of the term \"saimin\" before this, but after looking it up, I thought it was cool that it originated from Chinese words. Hawaii really is just one big melting pot of Asian cultures.  There was something about the texture of the noodles, which resemble ramen noodles. I liked the chewiness, bite, and flavor, not overcooked or soggy at all. Either way, I just couldn't stop eating. I only wish they had a bottle of Siracha or any real good hot sauce, instead of that weak mustard sauce. Inexpensive, friendly service, and tasty comfort food. All perfect components for repeat visits.",

I was in the mood for full-on Hawaiian.  Large saimin with veggies and wontons?  Check. Loco Moco plate?  Check. Spam musubis?  Check.  Ahhh.  Talk about an awesome lunch.  I don't understand why people would shell out tons of dough on whatevers food at the Strip when Aloha Specialties is just a five minute drive away.  Save yourself a bundle and check out this joint.

Aloha Specialties is a must go if you come here while in Vegas.  Great local comfort food for less than 10 bucks!

Perfect for anytime of the day and in any state, sober, buzzed, drunk, hungover...you get the point  Kaluha Pork - Juicy, tendered, and perfectly seasoned.  This is one of my all time favorite dishes and it is legit here.  Korean Spicy Chicken - Super tasty and delicious!  Not exactly your typical local Hawaiian dish but totally worth a buy  Spam Musubi - Get these not matter how much food you order or even if you think you are too full because they make the best late night eat or quick bite between casino hopping.  If you don't know what this is, it is a yummy fried piece of Spam with a sweet glaze wrapped in rice and Nori (seaweed).    If you venture to this part of Vegas eat here!",

Now I understand that the non-Hawaii people might not give this a 5 star rating but then again how many non-Hawaii people are hanging at the Cal?  I was hungry when I stopped by with the fam for dinner after hitting the floor at the Cal an working up an appetite.  The fried saimen is so good.  Noodle are tender but with enough tooth to them to be respectable.  No pasty or gummy fare here.  Toppings are fresh and flavorful with bright green onions with just a little tang to them.  Bean sprouts are crisp and milky white with a fresh taste.  I also had a cheeseburger in the same sitting (I was hungry and from Hawaii).  The patty was moderate in size, not thin and not gluttonously large.  It was hand made and contained fresh juicy beef that had that homemade flavor that no process patty can compete with.  Lettuce, onion, and tomato were firm, fresh, and juicy.  FYI you can get a side of kim cheese and toss it in the burger for a wonderful kim chee cheeseburger, not for the faint of heart or heart burn prone.  Overall the food is well made, portions are good, and the service is fast and friendly.  Beyond the food the friendly staff reminds me of home and that makes a meal at Aloha Specialities all the more special.",

They place the lettuce and tomato on the side in case you don't want it or if your buddy wants to double up on his/her veggies. They'll ask you if you want mayo or not (they also place it on the side for you).  I realize not everyone goes to a hawaiian restaurant will order this here, but from what I tried from my friend's bento box, the quality and flavor is better than any hawaiian restaurant that I've been to. Only thing that's better, in my opinion, are family potlucks/get-togethers.  Anyway, the pricing is fair given the amount of food you get.

I dropped in on a  recent Thursday for lunch.  6/28/12 to be exact.  I expected the usual good food and fast service.  I was really disappointed.  I ordered a plate lunch to go.  I took my receipt and sat down to wait.  I never left my seat right in front of the counter.  The cashier(younger lady) that took my order began eating her lunch right after I ordered from her.  No biggie.  I waited and waited and waited.  I started to notice that several people that ordered 15-20 minutes after me were receiving their food in the dining room.  No biggie.  I continued to wait and after 35 minutes I walked up to the front and asked hey where's my plate lunch.  A different(older lady) cashier looked at me like I was crazy.  I noticed that there was a partially boxed up meal to go right on the counter.  I asked is that mine?  She looked at me again like I was crazy.  The original cashier that was now finished with her lunch said \"oh yeah, that's his order\"  WTF, WTF!!  I've been waiting for my to go plate for like 40 minutes!!  In disappointment I took my meal and walked out of the casino.  When I opened it in my vehicle the entire meal was COLD, gravy was clumping up.  I know that Aloha specialties does well but you need to step up the service or fire some of your lazy employees.  The entire time I was waiting the staff kept going on about what they were going to do later that day and so on and so on.    I realize that this review will not affect their business at all but if ownership is reading this just remember nothing lasts forever.  You do have good food but your service is in the dumps.  Hire some people that actually want to be there.  Every one looked like they hated their jobs.  There are a lot of people looking for jobs right now.  I'm sure you can do better than the lunch staff you currently have.  Best of luck going forward.",

    "text": "Always make it a point to stop here when we are in Vegas. I don't think I have ever had anything on the menu other than the large saimin with wontons and spam musubi. And I usually end up realizing that I could've gotten by with just a small. The bowl comes with lots of noodles, tasty wonton, char siu, egg, fishcake, and green onions. All of the other dishes look good, but why take a chance when you know what you want. They only take cash, so make sure you save some of your winnings from the slots or blackjack tables. There are always plenty of Hawaiians at the restaurant, another sign of the authenticity of the restaurant.",

And yes to all the Hawaiian decor that makes you really feel like you're back on Oahu.  No to their breakfast prices.  We paid $5.75 for a breakfast plate, which is the same amount for the breakfast buffet downstairs, which also serves portuguese sausage, eggs, and rice.  However, if you don't want to wait in line for that buffet AND you're not that big of an eater, Aloha Specialties upstairs of the California is a fine option.",

It was drenched in Teriyaki sauce and it still was not edible. The only thing I liked was the macaroni salad.   I do not recommend this place and will not be coming back.",

The prices are fair and the portions are ample, though there are better values for Hawaiian food in Vegas (just not Downtown). This is a fast casual restaurant and the food comes out quickly. Everything I've had here has been delicious.  Aloha Specialties will continue to be in my lunch rotation.",

I always get some kinda bento, so I can have a little of a the different Hawaiian food groups - teri beef, chicken, and fish. I could be mistaken because of the lack of good Hawaiian back in SF, but this place is real good. Tasty.  The wife was amazed how fast I put down the food here on our last visit. But hey I was hungry.  Oh and bonus for all you fatties - there's a Lappert's ice cream right across.  Ask me if I went.",

    "text": "if you're from hawaii, this is legit local style food. I was pleasantly surprised by the authenticity of the beef stew which tasted exactly like my great grandmas/moms which was unreal. Usually when I come to the mainland the 'local/hawaiian' food has a mainland styled flair, which isn't necessarily bad it just shouldn't be called hawaiian. (There was even aloha shoyu on the table!) I also got the korean chicken which resembled zippy's korean fried chicken. The plates come with generous portions of rice haha see the scaled picture, which may seem like a lot but we did do some damage to that mound. They had a spicy ahi poke special that I had wished I tried, but the portions here are huge! The amount of money you pay for the food you get is the reason this is 5 stars. The prices average under $15. The food comes super fast too, I wanna say under 10 minutes. You order at the counter and take your number to the table of your choice and the servers bring your food to you. You should definitely come here if you're looking for some hawaiian style food away from home. The restaurant is clean, casual, and quiet. Didn't seem like it gets suuuper busy so there's no need to worry about reservations or long waits or anything. overall satisfied with this place!",

During our three night stay at Golden Nugget, we ate here 2x.  The first was breakfast-to-go where we got the Teriyaki Combo and Bento. I immediately took it back to Golden Nugget where we ate it right outside of The Shark Tank. Food & Drinks must be purchased inside Golden Nugget in order to bring it inside their pool but there is nothing affordable inside Golden Nugget's facilities. My boys love the food so much that they wanted dinner there that night. We were so full from breakfast from here that we skipped lunch and hung out at the pool all day. We had dinner that night there. It's a short walk from the Golden Nugget. This time, we ordered Mix Plate and the Local Plate. All three of us shared both plates. The Local Plate came without rice but the Mix Plate had enough rice for all three of us.  Again, the portions are huge and the food is very good. My son never had a Spam Musubi before and was so glad that I got him two. Local Plate comes with two Spam Musubis.  This place did not disappoint. We didn't see any lines both times we went and the food came really fast. The sodas are right outside so you get free refills. Water is free as well. We just brought our re-usable cups and filled it with water and ice.  If your looking for filling, delicious, and economical I suggest trying out this place. I'm not familiar with Hawaiian Food but ate at Ono in California. I mainly stayed with anything with Teriyaki. I wanted to try the huge bowl of soups that I saw other patrons ordering but, hopefully, next time we're back in town.",

Service:  This place is popular for many reasons and the staff knows it.  The cashiers get you processed quickly and they are fast with clearing and cleaning tables to get the next party dining asap.  Waters and drinks are self-serve which I have no issue with as the dispenser is an ideal location.  Grindage:  My two faves here.  1) Loco Moco = white rice + hamburger patty + gravy + egg (sunny side up for me)  you mix it all up and I'll throw in some hot sauce to get pure bliss. This was were I had my first Loco Moco many years ago and since then I've had many more! 2) Local Plate = Teriyaki beef +Teri chicken (no rice) + 2 spam musubis + mac salad.  This is such a great combination of food put together.  All the dishes with chicken and beef is a win for me and I also enjoy their Saimin noodle soup.  Ambiance:  Walls, seats, tables and decorations makes for a very clean casual setting for Hawaiian food.  Timing is everything as lines can pop out of nowhere because people seem to travel here in groups.    Aloha Specialties remains one of my favorite Hawaiian restaurants after all these years.  I'd visit more frequently if it wasn't so far from me but there's always a couple of planned Aloha Specialties visits because the food is great.   Give them a try if you haven't already, aloha!",

    "text": "Aloha Specialties is a Hawaiian restaurant located on the second floor of the California Hotel and Casino.   Today's Special was a Hawaiian Plate consisting of Lua Lua and your choice of Stew (Beef or Tripe) and served with Ahi Poke, Huapia, Steamed White Rice, and Macaroni Salad.  Our party ordered Spam Musubi, Aloha's Special: Ochoa Zuke, Chicken Teriyaki Bowl with Mixed Vegetables, and Beef Stew.   The Spam Musubi consisted of Spam, Teriyaki Sauce, and a block of steamed white rice wrapped with roasted seaweed. It could be seen as a snack or a full meal depending on how hungry you are.   The Ochoa Zuke consisted a grilled Saba (topped with tartar sauce and served with lemon), Spam (half dipped with teriyaki sauce), sliced Teriyaki Chicken, raw broccoli (served with ranch dressing), fishcakes, pickled ginger, radishes, and assorted Japanese pickles, and fresh tofu (garnished with scallions). This was served with a big bowl of rice and Japanese rice seasoning and a pot of Japanese Green Tea. It was a nice variety of their offerings.",

    "text": "Aloha Specialties is our go to spot where we know we can get good Hawaiian food in downtown. I completely agree with the other Yelp reviews on here that this place reminds me a lot of the local restaurants back in Hawaii. We've been coming here for several years now and I definitely have to say that this place has amazing island dishes along with excellent customer service.   My boyfriend and I came in for breakfast today and we were immediately greeted by two nice ladies at the front who were ready to take our order. They initially apologized that they were having technical issues with their system but we didn't mind one bit. I ordered the loco moco with over easy eggs and my boyfriend ordered the aloha breakfast that came with spam, Portuguese sausage, luncheon meat, eggs, and rice. The food came out quick with no wait at all. Both of our dishes were extremely delicious and flavorful.  I definitely recommend this place. The portions are huge and the price is affordable. I had to get a to-go box for mine actually. We always come here whenever we're in the area and will continue to keep coming back. By the way, if you park at the California garage, keep the receipt to validate your ticket to get free parking.",

    "text": "Literally EVERY time my family is near Las Vegas we make every effort possible to stop by Aloha Specialties Restaurant.  My grandpa introduced my dad to Aloha Specialties when it was still located on the other side of the Cal Hotel. Some may think Aloha Specialties is a small location now, well from what I have heard their current location is a huge upgrade.  Aloha Specialties is located on the second floor of the Cal Hotel, right across from a snack shop and a chocolate shop. They have a small location with a decent amount of seats. However, their prices and food seem to draw a crowd so big that seating can get scarce. For the most part their lines literally go out the door. Worry not, the line tends to go quick and the food doesn't come that much later. You order upfront, pay and take your number to your table.  I have tried numerous things at Aloha Specialties and have a few recommendations. I would definitely recommend the Combination Plate with pork, chicken and beef. It's only a dollar or so more than the bowl and its big enough to share with others. The plate comes with rice and a side of macaroni salad. All meats on this plate are flatten out and covered in teriyaki sauce. I enjoy every meat on this plate because they are all juicy and tender.  I also recommend a bowl of Saimin, don't ask what's in it, just try it!  Lastly, I recommend there Aloha Breakfast which comes with portuguese sausage, spam, eggs, rice and Hawaiian bread. Their portuguese sausage was pretty good, the spam wasn't bad but honestly you can't really go wrong with it, eggs are eggs, rice is rice, and the Hawaiian bread was yummy.   Cheesy Aloha Specialties is probably up there when it comes to a typical themed hawaiian restaurants. They have cheesy decor and random table cloths.  Overall This restaurant isn't literally a 4 star restaurant. However, it's a 4 star overall. You get good ethnic food for a more than reasonable price.  Tip Cash only . . . ATM located in the lobby",

It was a short walk from the museum, located on the mezzanine level of the California hotel/casino.   The menu is pretty simple, and the meals are about $10 each, they can easily be shared or saved for a second meal later in the day! They come with rice and macaroni salad.

    "text": "A Hawaiian friend who frequents Las Vegas recommended Aloha Specialties to me as the best place to get Hawaiian food.  So, I dutifully wandered in for dinner one night on my last Vegas vacation.  My wife ordered the Loco Moco, while I got one of the mixed plates.  When our dishes was served, I couldn't believe how much food was on the plate and for the prices we paid!  We stuffed ourselves full, but couldn't finish off everything.  The Loco Moco was very tasty, according to my wife.  And my plate, with the beef teriyaki, spam musubi and grilled fish, was wonderful.  My favorite was the fish, though the spam and beef were good, too.    For Vegas, the prices were very reasonable, especially since there was so much food.  If you come here, bring cash (no credit cards accepted) and a healthy appetite!",

If you're from Hawaii, you know this to be the truth! Dis is da place where most the locals go.   You get a lot of food for your money. The portions are fairly large so we ordered Aloha Breakfast with 3 eggs, spam, luncheon meat and rice and the Loco Moco with hamburger meat which was flavorful, egg over easy (runny) with gravy.   I had the saimin and teriyaki beef in the past. Great place to get your quick local fix.",

She seemed to have permanent frown, doesn't smile  and so rude.  They gave me my number but did not explain whether they will call out my number and I have to pick it up at the counter or they will bring it to my table, which was only 2 feet away from my table where my number 100 was fully visible.  So I patiently waited. 20  minutes later there is still no food and I didn't hear anyone calling out my number. After 35 minutes my patience has run out.  The old man who cleans out the tables saw my number and he saw my to go order has been sitting on the counter and he told me to come over.  He said they normally call out the number and I told him I didn't hear anyone calling out my number.  He handed me my order and I was about to leave when I realized I'm missing another order of spam musubis. So I came back for my order, the rude woman did not even apologize and instead looked at me as if annoyed.  The food was great but the service was horrible - I will never ever come back again.  This is NOT the only place that serves Hawaiian food.",

During my last visit, I ordered the Aloha Bento that came with mahi mahi, korean chicken, teriyaki beef, like, 4 cups of rice, and fish cake.  I promptly had a heart attack due to the massive heaps of fried goodness.*  But, it was worth it.    I also checked out some boiled peanuts, but, they were a little crunchy.  I like 'em soft, southern style.  I would give them four stars but I find the atmosphere a little lacking.  I like the relaxed, casual vibe but the usual crumbs on my table, and the pile of child seats on the floor, detracts from the experience.  Also, this place is CASH ONLY which makes me a little sad.  * Note:  Total lie.  Figurative heart attack.",

This place tends to get packed but it's worth waiting.  Luckily, this time around, we made our way here a little after the lunch crowd had already left.  Got their Aloha plate ($10.99) which includes chicken teriyaki, beef teriyaki, 2 spam musubis and macaroni salad.  I forgot that this doesn't include rice because it comes with 2 spam musubis so I went back to order some rice ($1.25).  This proved to be pointless because I only took 4 bites of rice and also had 1 spam musubi left over.  The beef teriyaki can be a hit or miss sometimes.  Unfortunately, the beef was somewhat tough this time around.  The chicken teriyaki was great though.  I also like their mac salad because it doesn't seem too heavy.  Once you order your food, they give you a number to put on your table.  They bring over your order and you're on your own after that.  There is a table near the entrance with cups and water dispensers with ice, as well as to-go boxes.  Oh and make sure you've got cash because this place is CASH ONLY.  This is the only reason why this place isn't 5 stars for me.",

I did want the mahi mahi, but unfortunately it was sold out. They did have poke which I love and for $5 how can you go wrong? I knew that wouldn't be enough food, so I got a teri burger for only $3.50! It was pretty good sized and tasty for that amount. The poke wasn't the best I've had, but for the price it was good. My wife ordered the small saimen w/ wontons and she thought it was great. It was a good portion for the price and I tasted the broth which was good.   This is a place I would definitely visit again. For the prices and the selection, it's probably better than the cafe downstairs. Sure, you can't get a $4 steak dinner after 11 PM, but overall the food is better.",

The bed of rice it was all served on was sticky and satisfying.  Ask for the special korean sauce.  It is spicy and sweet.  Went well with everything on my plate.

Mac salad was a little sour not in the spoiled way but just in taste and the loco moco gravy wasn't that rich deep gravy that you'd expect out of a loco moco.

The saimin is good and this place beats anything we have in LA.  Stop there when you get a chance and enjoy the food.  Service is good except you have to wait to order from the counter.",

You order at the counter, take a number and food is brought out to you.  Service was quick.  This past weekend, my boys and I tried the Kim Chee Saimen, Korean Chicken , and Tripe Stew.  Everything was hot and delicious.  The Saimen had a nice kick from the spicy kim chee and it included large blocks of tofu.   That bowl of soup was huge.  The Korean Chicken was also well flavored, moist and has a nice grilled crust.  We all agreed that the Tripe Stew was amazing.  Tender pieces of tripe in a not-so-thick tomato based sauce.  That was comfort food at it's best.  I would order that again.  Overall, it was a great visit to the hawaiian restaurant.",

My mom, the child of Norwegian immigrants, used to tell me that her parents brought out Spam on special occasions.  Ugh.  She didn't have indoor plumbing at the time, so there you go.  I've been to the Hormel plant in Austin, MN where Spam is made.  It's comprised mostly of leftovers from the kill floor.  They use everything from the pig except for the squeal.  Trust me on this one.  Everything but the squeal.  Yes, I did try the spam musubi.  Thanks for asking!  I also had the Moco Loco, which looks like a big pile of cow excrement.  It's comprised of white rice, seasoned ground beef, two or three eggs, and brown gravy.  Very tasty with some Tabasco on top!  I'm a fat guy already, but I'd be over three bills if I ate this dish with any regularity.    I'm knocking off a star because the staff was relatively rude.  Perhaps it was because I'm not Polynesian, but I cannot be sure.  Nothing fancy here, but give it a shot if you want to try something different.   It sure helped the old hangover.",

BINGO!!!!! This place is money!!  My friends ordered the Korean BBQ Chicken and I decided to be different and get the Garlic Chicken with Gravy. So each order comes plate style....meaning it came with rice, macaroni salad and HUGE amounts of chicken.   So there is no waiter service and everything is boxed up like you are getting it to-go. This was cool as they were able to serve lots of people in a short amount of time.  The Korean BBQ was spicy and had great flavor. The Garlic Chicken w/Gravy wasn't as flavorful but was still good. I really liked the kimchi here but unfortunately it was an add on item. I thought the macaroni salad was a bit salty.",

The portions are HUGE and the prices are cheap but the food quality was lacking! The sweet and sour ribs weren't even ribs, it was pork butt! The Korean chicken was tender but I didn't care for the skin that was left on it. The place is very old school which may work for some older people but not for me. There's other places that have the same style food and I'll be sure to check them out before ever stepping back into this flashback from the 70's. So please say aloha....

Bold statement I know but for the price, quality, quantity, service and consistency this place has it all. We've been going to Vegas for decades now and we've tried hundreds of restaurants from the ultra high end on the strip to the soul food in the hood. While there are absolutely some great eating spots in town we always find ourselves coming to Aloha Specialties every trip, if not multiple times. I get the same thing every time too, the garlic chicken with gravy over rice and a spam musubi. I could probably eat that every day of my life. Lunch hour can get crazy so expect to wait in a long line and for a place to sit. On weekends I've seen the line go out the door and into the casino. The service is pretty quick even when busy. This place is inexpensive and only accepts cash. But if you're rolling around Vegas without any cash it's probably time for you to go home.",

It didn't taste very korean at all, nor was it spicy (which it advertised).  However, it still tasted great.  Best of all, the prices are very reasonable.

Aloha Kitchen is located on the 2nd level of Cal Hotel in Downtown LV.    The food is down home Hawaiian style good. The rice and mac salad alone hits the spot after a weekend of debauchery. The line is usually out the door but it sure is worth the wait.  Note: do not save tables!  You will be scolded.    The food comes out really fast and it is cheap!  So, stash a $20 for lunch here on Sunday afternoon before you head home (and save your change for dinner at In-n-Out in Barstow).",

Anyway, we used to come here all the time and it would always be crowded and it would be hard to find a seat. This is the first place that I had a Spam Musubi. My mom would order the Saimin with Wonton and I'd share that with and get 2 Spam Musubis. I've always enjoyed it whenever we went there. I would always pick this place to eat at least once every time we went. ahhh.... memories. After, my parents would play on the slots and I'd wonder around since I wasn't of age yet.   I actually wanted to eat here when I went to Vegas but you know, I mainly stayed on the strip.",

I was even more curious to check out the Hawaiian food.    The restaurant is located on the second floor.  It is not a fancy restaurant.  You stand in line, place your order and they give you a number and they bring your food to you.  The prices are cheap considering that it is getting harder to find a good bargin meal in Vegas.    Once again, my eyes were bigger than my stomach, which means I order a bunch of things to try, knowing that I couldn't eat everything.  I had the kahlua pork combo that came with rice, macaroni salad.  I also ordered the saimin soup and nibbled on my mister's aloha bento that that came with fish, teriyaki chicken, bbq short ribs, and portugese sausage.  For dessert we had haupia.    My kahlua pork was tasty, maybe even better than King's, but the rest of the stuff was just all right.  The haupia was just coconut flavored agar-agar, kinda like jello.  Nothing special.    Overall, it was good to try, but it's nothing that I would be dying to try again.  I would rather stick to King's Hawaiian in Torrance.",

Mmm... I hate when you order a hamburger steak and it's a processed, machine pressed, hamburger patty that was made for a burger..  Totally not cool.. Wheres the love? Wheres the Aloha? You get the complete opposite here, this piece of meat was made to be a hamburger steak!  whatever spices and flavors they put in there are great!  You can taste the love and the Aloha!  Mmmm aloha... then top it with gravy and a grilled onion?!  I think i could just eat the gravy and rice!  but thats me, I'm known to do that even at thanksgiving!  The mac salad is good too, soft and creamy and goes even better with some of the gravy on top too.  What goes better with fat then MORE fat??  The other thing to get here is the Korean Chicken.  Spicy, but sweet and salty all at the same time..  The best way to describe it is a spicy teriyaki chicken cooked on the grill top..   And for the plane or car ride home don't forget to pick up a few spam musubi's.  No respectable person from Hawaii would leave home with out it.  Pros: one of the best hamburger steaks, even better than most places in Hawaii.. korean chicken, mac salad are good too.  Cons:  they don't take the Vacations Hawaii coupons and some of the items are just okay.  Cash only.  Advice: avoid peak lunch hours.. it can be really crowded.  Located between the bridge between the California Hotel and Mainstreet.",

It took forever to get to the front of the line.   It also states that people should not sit until they have paid. Obviously, people do not follow this rule and the business does not enforce it.   The topping to the cake was when I finally got to the front of the line and the cashier ignored me. Did not even bother to acknowledge me. A nice \"I will be with you in a moment\" would have been appreciated. Finally after refunding someone's money and ignoring me she finally took my order. As I gave her my CREDIT CARD she points to this TINY sign that read \"CASH ONLY\". I got sooooooooo pissed because it did not have this sign at the entrance.  Waste of my time! If you don't mind poor customer service, long lines, and people to tell you \"only cash\" once you've waited for a million years, then this is the place for you! Otherwise, go somewhere else. I highly encourage people to go elsewhere!",

Out of all the years that I've lived in Vegas, I've never stopped by Aloha Specialties to check out the food or \"grinds\" as us local peeps affectionately call it. The SO and I were in a chicken mood so I opted for the Korean Chicken on this visit and my wife went for the Chicken Chop. The Korean Chicken was awesome and not overly crispy like some places I've had it at. The Chicken Chop was pretty good but the Korean Chicken was the winner dish IMO. Wanted to try out the famed Teriyaki Chicken but decided to pass on this round. The food was a bit pricey (almost $20 for both of our plates, no soda) but I left happy so I looked past that. Keep in mind that I paid that almost $20 ticket with cash because they are still cash only. Minor set back but I would've liked to have gotten some points on my Hawaiian Miles card so I can get home and taste some real grinds. But, at least I have Aloha Specialties.   Good grinds, will be back for the Teri Chicken next time.",

This place is a mom-and-pop and hole-in-the-wall restaurant in California Hotel. I know a lots of Japanese live in Hawaii but  a place selling Teriyaki should not be named Aloha Specialties and should not be categorized as a Hawaiian cuisine.  I ordered Teriyaki Combo Plate. It comes with three types of meat: beef, chicken, and pork on a big plate of white rice and macaroni salad.  First of all, teriyaki sauce used here is a very generic teriyaki sauce you can find in a grocery. I think Yoshida's Teriyaki sauce from Costco is more fancy than the teriyaki sauce use in this restaurant.  Beef Teriyaki was a thin slide of a cheap steak and it was tough. I spent more time on cutting it and chewing it than enjoying it. Chicken Teriyaki was odd. It definitely has a big slice of chicken breast but it had small pieces and breaded together. The breaded cover was loose and thick. Pork piece was actually descent. It had a big chunk of fat with it. It's bad for the health but it was delicious.   Definitely this place is overrated and someone has to bring down the score to where it belongs to. This restaurant serves in large amount of food but in less quality. Also they are cash only.",

Bro and I decided to check out the much-heralded food offerings inside the California hotel, and prior to heading over to Main Street Station we accidentally stumbled across the Specialties. Order at the counter, take a number, tiny diner, what is this place???  $6.50 for an Aloha breakfast platter... a generous slice of spam, three slices of sausage, a nice slice of luncheon meat, THREE eggs (!!), a great big bit o' rice (NOTE: this is like Asian/Hawaiian/Filipino/etc. rice, not like pilaf or Spanish or anything) and!!!!!!!!!!!! The ultimate kicker: friggin ginormous piece of Hawaiian toast! SO GOOD!  We added a tripe stew for $7 something and it positively reminded my bro and I of a great Filipino dish that our Mom makes super well. It has a tomato-based sauce that no doubt traditional Hawaiian food connoisseurs will surely appreciate. We rounded out our meal with a musubi roll ($1.75) and it far exceeded our expectations in terms of awesomeness. WHO THOUGHT OF THIS SEAWEED WRAPPED GENIUS!!!  A magical blend of quality, quantity, location and timing brings LOOOOTS of people to this joint, so either come before or after the lunch rush and you'll be okay. Otherwise don't let the sheer amount of patrons scare you! The hordes are on to something!!!",

Hawaiians, for whatever reason, will spend their last waking moments in Vegas... literally an hour before they take the early evening flight on Hawaiian Airlines back to the islands... eating local Hawaiian food at Aloha Specialties at the Cal Hotel!  At least this was what was going on when I was here the Sunday after Thanksgiving. We waited in that long-ass line close to HALF AN HOUR. I struck up a conversation with the woman behind me about how the tap water in Vegas tastes terrible. (For those of you who aren't aware, the tap water in Hawaii is magically delicious.)  Alright, now for the actual review. This place is like a Zippy's with a much longer wait but a much smaller menu. However, for a mainland Hawaiian restaurant, the prices are very reasonable and the portions are generous. My dad and I both ordered the fried saimin (which to my dismay was mediocre... should have gone for the $4.95 large regular saimin!). My mom got some special Japanese lunch box (which I forget the name of), and my sister ordered the Korean-style beef and chicken plate lunch combo, which was really good. The mac salad hit the spot too.  There are a number of Hawaiian places around Vegas, but my guess is that this is the place to go if you wanna feel that real spirit of Aloha. Maybe that's just because it's full of Hawaiians in an extra good mood because they're grindin on yummy authentic local food. Just be prepared to WAIT.  Took a spam musubi ($1.50) to go, and ate it while I waited for my flight back to SF. I bet I got a bunch of weird looks by those unaware of the power of something resembling a oversized, angular sushi roll... but I don't care!",

The line was long, about an hour (luckily my sister was smart to wait for us as my relative got ready) and just ok with the food.   I ordered the garlic chicken but was brought something else, more like chicken cutlet. I mean whatever, I was so hungry I didn't care. I ate it, it was ok. A pretty big portion, I couldn't even finish the whole thing.   One weird thing is the amount of people visiting from Hawaii that eat there. I mean I get it, you're comfortable eating food that you like but there's SOO many places to eat in Vegas, why eat something you can get ANYWHERE at home.",

    "text": "This place is what it is! Unfortunately the atmosphere is consistent to the hotel they are located in so it's a bit old feeling and since it is a Casino, no windows are available to see the outside or time of day. Perhaps the tables could be smaller to accommodate more people to be able to eat as well. I know, it needs to be big to fit food, but I'm one that orders 3 meals for two people with 3 side dishes. When I say they can have more two people tables, it can be done.  Anyway, the service is direct and I forgot how \"as a matter of fact\" direct people are in Hawaii and the aloha was reserved for tourists. haha! Know waht you want to order by the time you get to the register and be clear. Other people are waiting and the ordering process is what it is. Even as a local Honolulu boy, I felt a little unwanted but I just relaxed and let things go since the atmosphere was just relaxed and care free.  The food! yes! Thank you for having a place I can eat some Hawaiian food while visiting Las Vegas! The portions are abundant like Hawaiian food should be! Lots of rice!! yes!! get your own water! yes!! Costco sized Tabasco!! yes!! Weird fat Portuguese sausage? weird but that seems to be the standard in Vegas everywhere I had them.  Overall a fan and I visited 3 times in the 5 days I was in the area . . . even though I spent $50 just for a taxi ride to and from the strip to get here! :p yeah, what can I say?",

And I like the macaroni salad even more because it is not as lathered in mayo or salty as it used to be. However, the kim chee and spam musubi wasn't like I remembered. The kim chee was a bit too vinegary, and the rice on the musubi was to bland. Fortunately, the hamburger/cheeseburger is my go-to dish there, and that's still great. The portions are still huge and the last time, I had a taste of the teriyaki chicken, and that tasted great. Before, I thought I would try the other dishes, like the saimen, but the portions on many of the items are too big more me, now, and I think that consideration is out for me, unless I can share a dish with someone else.",

    "text": "Been coming to ALoha Specialties for over a decade. Glad to see that they have remodeled and expanded their restaurant. There is now much more seating and space....  The food here is delicious. The portions are large and decently priced. Definitely get more than what you pay for in comparison to other hawaiian spots. I always leave Aloha Specialties stuffed and satisfied. My favorites are the Garlic Chicken with Gravy and their Loco Moco. Meat is proportioned well with the rice that the meals are served with. Recently tried their Portuguese Sausage with rice and egg, which was appetizing as well. The sausage was a little on the salty side when eaten without rice, but balanced perfectly when scooped and eaten together...  I would give Aloha Specialties five stars, but the line to order is horrible. It has grown in popularity and is always busy, so it takes forever to order your food. They only have one cash register, which is part of the problem. When renovating, they should have added a few more registers (or even at least one more at the minimum) to prevent such delays in ordering. I will say this though...It's evident that all the employees work hard...every worker is always busy and on the go with their duties. While occupied though, they are still always happy to help.  Note: cash only accepted",

    "text": "It's had to been at least 3 years since my last visit here and my opinion of this place has not changed one bit.  The menu is basically the same and the prices are still as good as it gets.  Comfort food at its finest when you're in DTLV.    Aloha's is located in the California Hotel & Casino (2nd level). What to expect...perfect late night dinner, ginormous portions, and great prices.  You can get most HI dishes here and the menu is simple.  My suggestion...get their Teri anything.  One of the guys in our group was excited because Kalua Pig was on the menu.  Once we got in line, bam! Kalua Pig is all out.  Aloha's must have noticed his disappointment. They immediately took the sign down and it was back on the menu.  Yes! Juice! Elite!  Tag Team...back again!  Juice was happy he got his dish and that made the rest of us as happy as can be.    As for me, my favorite is their Loco Moco, but opted for their Local Plate on my most recent visit.  This consisted of their Teri Beef, BBQ Chicken, Two Spam Masubi's, and Mac Salad.  Again, portions are huge but that really didn't stop me from deMELishing this.  Yeah..new word folks. That means no meal is safe around me.  My only issue, where's the rice?  I ended up stealing a few forkfuls of rice from the girlfriend.  Hah...problem solved. She didn't even notice because I got catlike ninja skills. But I did notice that she stole some of my mac salad. Yeah..I noticed. Remember, only a ninja can stop a ninja.    PS:  If you can't wait for Market Street Cafe's infamous Oxtail Soup that is served later at night, then head up the escalators and find your way here at Aloha Specialties.

This place can get pretty crowded at lunchtime, so make sure to get here early before everyone wakes up or checks out of their hotel rooms.   I had the local plate, which was 8.95$ before tax.  Definitely a good deal as the portions are big, filling, and tasty.  The local plate comes with two spam musubi, chicken and beef teriyaki, and a side of macaroni salad.  I wasn't too hungry, so I was able to eat all but one spam musubi, which I foiled-up and packed-up for my airplane ride back home.    Take out boxes and foil is located near the front entrance, just below the water dispenser in case you want to take your leftovers.  They also accept credit card now (sorry, no AMEX).  Overall, a great filling meal that won't hurt your wallet. It's great to find some good quality food options that aren't too pricey like most of Vegas.  Aloha!",

After 2 months of renovating I am finally able to come back after the renovations Cons: ~45 minute wait in line (this maybe due to their outdated POA system and/or person(s) operating the cash register) Health Grade of C (Yes you read that right)  Pros: Food is delish (if your willing to buy food at a place that has a C rating) Consistently good food More seats inside Modern (ambiance, seats, tables, etc.) Spicy Korean Chicken (my personal fav) Loco Moco got better (idk maybe I havent had loco moco in a while) Prices Right across an ice cream eatery  FYI Saimin is now only one size (used to be small or large saimin, not a big deal tho!!)  To be honest, there isn't many cons for this place, but the two I stated can be serious gripes. The food is consistently on par in quality and taste. The place is clean. This place isnt a 50 shades of grey on my tastebuds, but its delicious.  Finally they upgraded their C grade (health code) to an A  If your in need of Hawaiian food to neutralize you appetite try this place out, its been good enough for me to eat at this place for the past couple of years.",

    "text": "When I was told we would be getting Hawaiian food.. in Vegas.. I can admit, I was a bit skeptical.  And when we arrived there was this humongous line and I was like.. ugh... I'm so hungry, can we go somewhere else?  It took a little over an hour to get through the line, and I can admit, it was absolutely worth it!  Prices here are soo reasonable, I think we paid about $65 for four people, we all got a main entree plate and got an additional two saiman and an order of ahi poke and a few drinks.  Ahh.. ahi poke.. I only wish one thing:  that I ordered more!  But the sad truth to it all, is that at the end of it, we didn't even finish the saiman, we were THAT full (and this was not without lack of trying).  The only thing I will warn is this.. the local plate comes with spam musubi (in which there is a nice chunk of rice inside the seaweed) it DOES NOT come with additional rice for the teriyaki beef/chicken.  If you order a side order of rice, you will not need it all, you can probably split it with a friend (we ordered two sides after the fact and it was toooo much rice, my sister didn't even finish her spam musubis!).  Bento plate is essentially the same plate except the spam is served next to a giant bed of the rice (and no seaweed) with the teriyaki meats.  I could have probably shared the rice on my plate and no one would have had to order extra.  The last thing ordered was the Aloha plate.. all I can say is, no one had any complaints.  Everything was delicious!  We would have finished the saiman.. if only, we had, more room in our bellies!  Now I can see why this place is so popular.  Definitely worth the hour wait, and the line never ended.  The only thing we were sad about was things slowly started disappearing off the menu (sold out) as we got to the front.. literally, they ran out of garlic chicken right before we reached the order window (darnit!).  To be fair, we did hit the register around 8:30pm and that was close to closing time.    I don't know if this place could go any faster, there is one lady working the orders, one guy expediting orders, and he helps serve along with another girl, and the kitchen seemed to be cranking out orders as quick as they possibly could.  Everything was fresh and tasty (can't complain). The staff was nice, which is always a plus in such a hectic kitchen.  We will definitely will be back if I'm down by the Californian the next time I'm in Vegas!",

    "text": "This was the first time I've tried Hawaiian food and let's just say it's left me craving for more! My friends and I came here for breakfast (it was closer to lunch time though, hah) and we decided to share so we can try a little of everything.   Amongst four girls, we ordered:  Ahi Poke - DELICIOUS! If you are a fan of raw fish, this appetizer is an absolute must. It is chunks of tuna perfectly marinated in some wonderful, addicting sauce with raw onions and scallions. It was so good that we ordered 3 more to-go, just so we can eat it later. This is just one of those dishes that you simply cannot share, because you'll want it all to yourself!!!   Kimchee Saimin - Comes in a huge bowl with addicting kimchee broth. It is definitely shareable, unless saimin is the only thing you want to eat. I can't tell if this had MSG in it or not, but my friend said it didn't. This dish is very similar to ramen, but the noodle is different. We were only expecting kimchee in our soup, but to our pleasant surprise, there were also pork slices and tofu cubes!  Side of Chicken Teriyaki  2x Spam Musubi - It was my first time trying musubi and I honestly thought it'll just taste like spam and rice wrapped with seaweed. I'm not a fan of spam so I didn't think I'll like it much. But I have to say, it was pretty good... probably thanks to the sauce that was between the spam and rice.   4x Coconut pudding - For only $1.75, this might be the best coconut pudding I've had in my life. It's hard to describe but the texture and taste of the pudding is very similar to the coconut meat you manage to scrape off the shell after you're done drinking all the juice. It isn't overly sweet nor artificial tasting. I can go on and on trying to describe the taste from memory, or you can go ahead and try it!  We wanted to order more but we were about to go eat again shortly after this meal. (What else do you do besides eat when you're on vacation? ;)) So this \"light\" breakfast actually turned out to be more filling than we thought! By the last bite of our coconut pudding, we were more than satisfied.  It is cash-only so remember to bring cash! Free parking if you bring your hotel parking lot receipt and food receipt to the casino cashier.",

    "text": "Four solid stars for this no frills with Aloha friendliness tucked on the second floor of the California Hotel in Downtown Las Vegas. I was craving ramen and did not have a lot of time in between jumping from hotels so yelp reviews led me here.  A good sign was that there were local repair people eating here which was a good sign. In addition, for those that no nothing about the California Hotel  - it primarily caters to the folks from the islands and there were plenty of them here.  For those not familiar with the downtown Vegas hotels, unlike the strip, these hotels will charge for parking. Fortunately, at this hotel, as long as I had the restaurant validate my visit, I got a refund prior to exiting as I had to pay $5.00 upon entering.  AS can best be described as having a simple decor with the menu board posted on the wall as one waits in line to order.I chose the chau siu ramen and ordered for an extra charge won tons with it. The ramen is offered in two sizes ( regaular and a larger bowl). The food will be brought to your table and i got it in no time.  After all, we are talking noodles in a broth right.    The next time you are in Vegas and feel like venturing to the older downtown area, check out Aloha Specialties.",

I felt like I could take off my shoes and stay a while. With the look of a couple staff members, my pants too. Boing!!! I always order the loco moco extra sloppy (like my kisses) and it did not disappoint. I recommend this highly if you like Hawaiian/Asian food. These meals always make me super horny, so I try to eat here 15 times a week. Boing!!! Aloha and see you next time.",

    "text": "I was staying at the Golden Nugget nearby for work and a friend recommended heading here for dinner and told me what to order, the saimin and the spam musubis.  There were signs in the casino pointing the way and I headed up to the second floor. I got there around 7pm and there was no one else in line so I was able to quickly order and it took about 5 minutes to get my food to go so I could eat it in my hotel room.   It was packaged really well with the noodle soup in two containers, one for just the broth and one for the noodles and toppings, and the local plate which has teriyaki beef and chicken as well as 2 musubis and the macaroni salad. I definitely over ordered.   I got back to my room and started with the local plate. It was pretty yummy. The teriyaki chicken was crispy which was nice and the beef was tender. I was a little wary of the spam musubis because I'd never had them before but they were really tasty and huge. I left the saimin for about 45 minutes but it was still really hot when I tucked in. I was only able to finish half of it. The broth was nice with a good flavor of dashi and very clean, there were plenty of noodles, char siu and fish cakes. I should've added the vegetables for something green but I only managed to finish half of it anyway. The macaroni salad was okay but it wasn't really anything special. I could take it or leave it.   My meal was less than $20 bucks and I only managed to eat about half half of it so good value for money. Excellent recommendation and I would recommend it too if you're in the area and want some Hawaiian food.",

As everyone has stated: the portions are huge, the prices are ridiculously low, the food is yummy, and the service is with a smile.  Honestly, even if only three of those were True, it would still warrant a thumbs up from me.  Next time we are in Vegas we will skip the MGM buffet (seriously the worst) and eat here.",

I ordered a bunch of sides of chicken teriyaki, which was overly sauced. Actually, all of the food was overly sauced, I would have to drain the sauce off of the meat for almost everything.   Beef broccoli came with a lot of onion and average broccoli with a little meat.  Aloha bento was good, I asked for no rice or any carbs, but this is NOT the place to do keto, since everything is sweet, as all Hawaiian food is. I wouldn't go out of my way to come here, to be honest unless you're already there. As much as I hate to say it, I think Ono or those other hawaiian BBQ places are better.",

We ordered the Aloha Combo - Bento, spam musubi, saimin, a side of mac salad, and a side of kimchi.   The Bento Aloha Combo came with furikake rice, grilled teri chicken and beef, a piece of spam, and pickled ginger and radish. The teri chicken was a boneless thigh with the skin on. The skin was nice and crispy and the meat was super juicy. The teri beef was juicy with just a bit of fat left on for flavor. The teri sauce was a nice balance of sweet and salty.  Spam musubi was ok but could've used a slightly thicker slice of spam.  Saimin had a light broth that was a good accompaniment to our combo plate. The noodles were cooked well.  Mac salad was really bland. Wouldn't order again.  Kimchi was pretty good, not sure if it's made in-house but it was tasty.   Service was ok, they all seemed a little burnt out but were still helpful. Overall, a decent meal but nothing spectacular.",

    "text": "Alright guys. This restaurant is a Must for locals from Hawaii. This restaurant is located on the second floor of the California Hotel and has so much island favorites.   Their menu includes bentos and combo plates for such a good price. We ate here twice; once on Monday night for dinner and again on Tuesday morning for breakfast. On Monday night, we ordered the garlic chicken with brown gravy and the mixed plate, which consisted of teri steak, chicken, and mahi.   The garlic chicken with brown gravy was so delicious--so much so that my friend couldn't wait to eat it when it arrived to our table. Unfortunately I wasn't able to snap a picture. The brown gravy though stole the show. Reminded me of a pork cutlet type of gravy; so rich and flavorful.   The mixed plate on the other hand had the three meats: beef, chicken and fish. The teri beef and chicken both had a glaze of teri sauce while the mahi had a spread of tartar sauce. On the side was a scoop of mac salad. The teriyaki glaze tasted so delicious. The mahi was also tasty and with all of the flavors together, it all worked together in perfect unison.   On Tuesday morning we ordered beef stew and the saimin. The beef stew coupled with the mac salad really brought me back to my mom's home cooking. My friend loved his saimin and I did too! The broth definitely made the dish for that's where all the flavor came from.   Whenever I'm in Vegas I'll always visit this restaurant at least once. It reminds me of home and the food is delicious. If you want a taste of the islands definitely give this place a shot.",

But after waiting in line to order for an hour, and then waiting another 30 minutes to get our food, I just did not feel like it was worth it at all.   We were a pretty big group, so we ordered a series of different items. Our orders included the Aloha breakfast, spam musubi, combo special, and the loco moco.   The aloha breakfast consisted of 3 eggs, rice, Portuguese sausage, spam, and ham. To me, this meal was good. It felt very much like something my parents would've whipped up for me when I was younger, but it was nothing to write home about.   The spam musubi was the biggest letdown. The portion of the spam was so small, plus the rice was seriously overfilled, and the seaweed tasted old.   The combo special included the spam musubi, teriyaki beef, and chicken. The beef was okay.  The loco moco was probably the best part of our experience at this restaurant. This included gravy, egg, and a hamburger patty over a bed of rice. I kinda wish I had ordered this instead:   If you end up at this hotel somehow, I'd recommend for you to eat at the Market Street Cafe instead.",

Especially when we have 3 first timers that drove 10 hours to get some great tasting food.  I too am in the service industry, but the way this waitress acted was totally unacceptable and if she worked for me, I would TERMINATE her for her lack of customer service skills.  I didn't get her name, but she had long hair and looked Hawaiian.  To management, she's detrimental to your business.",

The spam musubi, saimen, and the local plate are my favorites.  The sweet and sour spare ribs are good too.  On the local plate you get beef, spam musbi, and teriyaki chicken and rice and mac salad. Wish I could substitute the sweet and sour spare ribs for the beef.  The beef is just meh.  The teri chicken is PHENOMENAL.  The skin is crispy and the sauce so perfect.   Not too sweet or salty - just perfection!!!  OMG, I'm craving a local plate now that I'm writing this review.  I could eat at this place 2x a week - not that it's good for you.  The restroom outside of this restaurant seems very well kept and clean compared to other casinos.  Only downside is that this place can get crowded.  Sometimes you have to share a table with someone.  The other downside is that it's in a dive of a casino in downtown that is filled with cigarette smoke.  IDEA FOR MANAGEMENT - Wish they would open a location in HENDERSON - on Eastern perhaps.  Please?  I beg you!  And how about one in TORRANCE, CA?  Pretty Please???  It's urgent.  My craving for local plate is out of control.",

I've watched the service deteriorate since I was a child, yet the food has stayed the same. Wonderful.   The only reason this is a three star review is because the food is just as phenomenal as it was when I was young. The Sai-Min is incredibly flavorful and soothing. We ordered two bowls of the Chicken Tofu Sai-Min with added vegetables, having ordered the regular as well as the kimchi before.   Usually, service is fine. This time, however, service was horrid. We waited 45 minutes for two bowls of Sai-Min. Usually this wouldn't bother us, we're fairly patient people and all we had planned we're errands. What made the whole experience agitating was the fact that people who ordered after us were receiving their food, and we were just sitting there, very hungry. I understand that some dishes take longer to prepare than others, but it was simply ridiculous. I was prepared to walk out. On top of it, our waitress kept singing loudly and high pitched, and something terrible was going on the hallway beside the kitchen. I have no idea what it was, but it was slightly gear-grinding and loud. Almost like a fork was stuck in a sink's garbage disposal.  The decor hasn't changed since I was small. Frankly, it looks dirty and unmaintained due to age. I love the photos of the owners, though. It puts a smile on your face, honestly. Drinks are pricey and the water station is a serve yourself, open to anyone who'd like to sneeze on the pitchers or in the ice. So many problems...but the food. The food is still great.  Overall, if you're a very patient person with nothing to do but talk and spend time with your company, who also does not mind being disregarded by staff, then this is perfect. The Sai-Min saved the review. It's just that delicious.",

    "text": "Need some Island style home cooking? Well Aloha Specialties is the place to visit for that itch. Located on the second floor of the California Hotel & Casino. I felt I was transported back to Waikiki.   I arrived on a Sunday and made it a point to drive directly here after landing from  So Cal. I had a Hawaiian grub itch that needed fixing quick. After valet parking (self park $3.00) I jumped in the long line to place my order and  opted for the small saimin and Loco Moco since I couldn't decide  on what to choose. Not long after being seated the friendly waitress brought me the two entrees.  I cracked up BC she was looking for another person to give a dish to. Even the customer next to me was shocked what I was going to attempt to do. We laughed about taking leftovers for dinner. Hey at these bargain prices - how could I possibly go wrong? It's cash only so leave your plastic in your purse or wallets people.  The saimin broth was yummy, chau Sui seasoned to perfect flavor - not overcooked or to sweet and just the right amount of fat. the small order was generously sized and hit the spot. The loco moco was also gigantic with a steamed rice base topped with a hamburger patty and drenched with gravy and a medium cooked egg once top . Talk about comfort food - this definitely is the place to find it.   There's seating out front if you''re nto people watching while dinning and many entrees sell out as did that day. I'm looking forward to returning and sampling  additional island style favorites.",

Monday we drove to the California Casino for breakfast.  There is even a plug on the 6th level parking for our electric car, tho it is but 110 volts.  Anyway, I had eggs over rice with spam and portuguese sausages!  Nothing fancy, but a big delicious deal for me.  Three more days here in Vegas--must go back for a bowl of Saimin noodles.  And they had Bento boxes too!",

Sadly, I've noticed the quality has been steadily going downhill throughout the years. The service even though slow, was always pleasant but lately it seems that everyone is on the edge and very easily irritated by people. Last Saturday I witnessed the cashier snap at someone in the back/kitchen in front of patrons and they weren't even discreet about it. So awkward and unprofessional if you ask me. Also the food isn't what it used to be taste wise, portions are still ginormous but what's the point in that if I don't even want to finish it. The Korean chicken is still flawless, thank God for that! Perfectly crisp skin and tender juicy meat with a kick ass marinade. The teriyaki hamburger steak was awful, the steak was dry and the teriyaki sauce had a cloying sweetness that was undesirable. Kalua pork was ordinary, the one I make at home tastes so much better. No lie. Lol  Their Green Valley location is still my preferred place as not only the staff nicer, but they offer a wider variety of the menu as well. They have Chicken Katsu and Fried rice for example that their California Hotel location doesn't carry.",

We should have just stuck with the BBQ chicken plate as other customers had it and it looked ono. The \"mixed vegetables\" are basically stir fried bean sprouts with celery. Mac salad is very \"Hawaiian-style\" lots of mayo, if you like it that way, it was a reminder of home.   There are hit and miss items on the menu. This one was a miss. The renovations look nice though. Clean, local feel. The line to order food is placed in a better location within the layout as well.",

The restaurant is located in the California Hotel and Casino.  You need to time your visit here (i.e., go early) because this place gets crowded!  I always wondered why Hawaii people would rush to a Hawaii restaurant in Las Vegas.  Don't we get enough local food at home?  It's all about comfort food.  Prices are reasonable, but the food preparation can take a while.  Be sure you have some good topics to talk with your table mates about.  Employees here work super hard to ensure you have a good experience.  Large Saimin Noodles:  This dish was just like eating local noodles at home in Hawaii.  The portions are quite large.  The saimin tasted like S&S saimin.  Although the noodles were a bit too soft and smooshy for me, it reminded me of my childhood.  Nice.

Period.  The flavor was right on, but the texture was a bit starchy and thick.  Not my style of local chicken curry.  Grade:  C+  Pork Tofu:  This dish was like home cooking!  Slices of pork cooked with onions, tofu, and served in a mirin, shoyu, and hondashi sauce!  WINNER!

Located in the California Casino on the second floor, this no frills Hawaiian cafe is oh so satisfying. We usually ordered thw combo mix plate, which comes with teriyaki chicken and beef, 2 spam musubis, rice and mac salad. For all this food it was only 10 bucks. The other plate that was amazing was the garlic chicken plate. It comes with a huge portion of crispy fried garlic chicken smothered in gravy and served with rice and mac salad. You will not be disappointed it is definitely a staple and a must get at this spot. Overall, if you are looking for quick, cheap and delicious island food then definitely come to this spot.",

We opted for the Aloha Breakfast, Aloha Bento, small saimin and teriyaki salmon...and 4 Spam MUSUBI to go.  To feed a family of 4 was less than $45.  For a person who can eat cups upon cups of rice, Aloha Specialties satisfied my starch hunger and fulfilled my daily intake in one sitting.  The Aloha Bento was a plateful of rice, fish, hot dogs, chicken and beef teriyaki. The Aloha Breakfast contained a variety of meats including Spam and the ever popular luncheon meat. Only those with a taste for meat in a can will distinguish the subtle flavors between Spam and luncheon meat.  The small saimin was actually a medium in some ramen restaurants.  The salmon was probably the smallest of the dishes, but came with white rice and macaroni salad.  The ambiance is great with 98% of the diners from Asia.  In all I give them an A+++.  Mahalo",

The portions are big and so authentic.    I normally get the Wonton min Saimin.  If you've ever eaten saimin in Hawaii, you can't tell the difference.  I've taken a few of my friends here over the years and they are hooked.  Every time we get close to downtown, we have to make a stop at the Cal and hit Aloha Specialties.   I've had other things on the menu and I can honestly say everything tastes great.  I know some people have reviewed that the service isn't that friendly there and they don't smile.  If you know that going in and know that your food is authentic and tasty that's all that matters.  For me it's the only place that is a must-stop place to eat when in downtown Vegas.",

Eggs were done well. Gravy was ok and patty was ok. I think If the patty was grilled instead of cooked on a flat top I might like it more.   Saimin is pretty good though I would like it better if the noodles had more chew to them. The teriyaki chicken is excellent. The hamburger patty in the sandwich ... I didn't care for. It tasted a little gamey like it was grass fed beef which I don't like.   I gave this place 4 stars instead of 3 because of the generous portion and the service was friendly and efficient.   I'll try something else if I come back which might be the beef stew.",

We came during the Sunday lunch rush and stood in line for about 30 minutes and waited another 15 minutes for the food. There were only two people doing all of taking orders, running orders to tables, and cleaning tables.   Service needs some SERIOUS work. I witnessed the busser kick a group off their table after they had already claimed it and specially gave it to a different group. NOT RIGHT! The cashier also just stands there for a long period of time not taking orders, staring at the long line. I also witnessed the cashier touch money then go straight to touching plates and running food. Hmm...  The portions are big! They can definitely be shared between two people. I ordered the local plate. It was reallllly good! The mac salad tasted fresh. There was a plentiful amount of teriyaki sauce over the chicken and beef, and each meat was cooked just right. The spam musubi was perfect.   Overall, I would definitely come back. Just gotta make sure to time my visit during off times to avoid the larger crowds.",

Saimin with added veggies. Broth and noodles are better than average for a very fulfilling meal.   Local Plate has Teri beef & chicken with two spam musubis. Teri Chicken is rated a 10. Teri beef is better than average. The spam musubis were average (compared to the ones I make). I would have preferred one spam musubi and a scoop of white rice.   Ocha Zuke has all good stuff except for the Saba fish. It was a little dry and tasteless. The Teri chicken, spam, tsukemono, tofu, takuan, kamabuko, broccoli, and tea/rice was all on point. Very satisfying and basically healthy dinner.   During peak times, the wait to order and the wait for your food can be 30 minutes each. Plan to eat during non-peak periods and be happier.",

Easily 2 lbs of rice and a gigantic patty with loads of gravy. Amazing value for $7.99 in my opinion.  Other than that, the gravy was unique; not too salty and not too light. It went well with the perfectly cooked over easy eggs on top of it all.  I recommend this place for its ridiculous portion sizes at a great value.",

Any who, whenever I'm in Vegas and I find myself in Downtown, I always end up here.   Located on the second floor of the California Hotel and Casino, I never knew the name of this place.  Thats probably because I was either drunk, hungover or a combination of the two. All I knew is I wanted a Moco Loco, aka that dank Hawaiian drunk food. The bed of white rice, covered by a huge hamburger patty covered by two over easy eggs and drenched in gravy come together to make this amazing slop of a meal. It definitely tastes better when you're inebriated.   Being that I was always sloshed, I never noticed how bad the wait time was here. It took 15-20 minutes to wait in line and order your food and then another 20-25 minutes for them to bring it out. Moral of the story: you'll enjoy your Moco Loco better if you're drunk.",

    "text": "Ironic how, as we passed Aloha Specialties in The California Hotel, we initially remarked how dumb it was to eat local Hawaiian food in Vegas when we can eat that all the time at home. And then went to eat there.  Staying at the Orleans, and eating breakfast at the Copper Whisk Cafe, and Chinese soup or sushi at Ondori Kitchen almost every day gets boring. So we venture out to eat lunch somewhere between Orleans and downtown, and end up gambling mostly at Main Street Station.  On the last day of our trip, we ate breakfast at 4:00 AM, didn't eat lunch, and went to Main Street Station and had a decent craps session. Then Sean wanted to eat local food so we ended up walking over the enclosed skybridge above Main Street to Aloha Specialties in The Cal.  In perspective, having over $125 per day in food credits at the Orleans between the two of us, and not even using half of that during the trip, Sean wanting to pay for dinner at Aloha instead of going back to Orleans to eat a more expensive steak or prime rib dinner for free is remarkable.  There was very little wait when we got there at 3:15 PM. You order at the counter, and your food is brought to your table. During peak meal hours, the line is out the door, and people have trouble finding a table.  I was very surprised at the quantity and quality of the food. The food tasted pretty good and you will not leave hungry. Sean's beef stew portion was about twice the size you would get at L&L for less money - $10. And my chopped steak was a very large portion which included teri-marinated beef, celery, carrots, onions and bean sprouts for $10.  Inexpensive tasty food will always bring people in.",

It's located on the second floor of the California Hotel & Casino, alongside other shops and stores. It's not too big of a restaurant, but does have a good amount of seating if you were to come with a group.   I wasn't too hungry so I had 2 Spam Musubis and ate some of my boyfriend's Mix Plate.  Spam Musubi (1pc. - $2.60): Kinda steep for a single Spam Musubi, but I thought I wasn't going to need anymore than a few bites after eating 2. Unfortunately, their rice to spam ratio is TOTALLY off!! I had at least a 1 1/2 inch size block of rice to a 1/2 inch slice of spam. Even when I bit into the Musubi, rice spilled out from the other end because there was just too much of it! Wasn't flavored much in any way, just tasted like fried spam.  Mix Plate ($11.29): This plate included Mac Salad, Fried Mahi, Teriyaki Steak and Chicken with Rice. The Mahi had some Tartar sauce layed on top of it, and there was some Teriyaki sauce on top of the beef...not much on the Chicken. The Beef was probably my favorite due to the flavor and how it wasn't too dry - can't say the same for the Chicken or Mahi which were both lacking moisture/juice.   I think our other friends who got the Loco Moco were much more pleased with their food - maybe next time we'll try that instead if we're staying in the area again.",

Overall the meal is very large. It took me 2 generous meals to finish it all. I didn't finish the rice because they just give so much! Most of their dishes are very large, so I recommend sharing it and get a side of something else for variety. They have a chicken and beef bowl that are so cheap and still a decent serving. It is amazing how busy this small restaurant gets. That's because the servings are huge, the taste is great, and the price is awesome. I want to come back to try some of their noodle soups. I am a little cheap, so sometimes I can have a bias because the deal is so good that it taste even better. My boyfriend actually comes weekly during his lunch breaks for the chicken bowl, so it's good enough that he just keeps coming back.  Order in line, they give you a number, and then they will bring the giant bowls/plates to your table. I am not a huge fan of redondo sausages. It just tastes like a hot dog to me. The tilapia that comes with the bento is just okay. I'll stick with the chicken dishes and maybe try the giant soups :)",

I could see my grandma serving the food, my brother and I bussing the place.   The food quantity is pretty crazy, it makes my brother and I really full. And we used to eat 3-4 hamburgers and 1-3 fries each at innout. So maybe plan to share a dish and a side between two people.   All the dishes here are great, but I just want to warn you that the quality varies between dishes because the menu is so large. So if you go to the restaurant the first thing in the morning and order an unpopular item it may be an item re-heated from yesterday. I had that experience with the sweet and sour pork ribs. So my advice, stick with the popular items on the menu including the island favorites and plates.   This is a consistent restaurant that had a big slip up today, but in most cases it is a reliable and great restaurant to go for some Hawaiian food.",

For me, I ordered a lot even though I didn't eat it all, I just wanted to taste.  Yes, that's the foodie in me. :( FAT ARSE.. :)   Food:  Korean Combo- Kalbi, Korean Chix, mac salad, rice and kimchee Beef Stew plate- Stew, rice and mac salad  For the Korean Combo the highlight was the kimchee.  The meats were just okay.  I ate a couple of pieces and called it a day.    The beef stew was delicious.  The meat was so tender and the flavor was exactly as how I remember it in Hawaii.   Now, the downfall?  The rice was hard.  I guess not enough water when they cooked it or it was old so I didn't eat it.  Everyone else I was with said the same thing. :(   Overall, I will visit here as often as I can when I'm in Vegas.  I wanted to give a shout out to the young lady who has relatives in Wahiawa. She delivered our food to us and she was so nice. :) Truly she has the Aloha Spirit. :)",

I'm not normally the biggest fan of cabbage but it was a good mixed with the pork.  I really wanted a combo plate with the Kalua pork but that wasn't an option so ordering the teriyaki chicken side for $3.50 was an easy substitute. The hubby loved his mixed played as well. I think it had beef teriyaki, mahi of some kind and maybe a chicken breast? Not sure about the 3rd meat (he's not around to ask right now) but he enjoyed all of it. Oh and he had to have the extra side of Mac salad, he loves theirs!  The haupia was yummy!  Nice and creamy!  You can't beat the prices, pretty sure everything pictured was under $35!  In Vegas that's hard to do lol  We went in their starving and left stuffed, probably because we over did it on the ordering but we needed to try it all lol. I'd do it again in a heartbeat!",

But I give the Korean chicken a 10/10 for flavor and 5 stars for consistency. It's a little spicier then I remember but it's okay I like it! And the sauce is to die for.

I was pleasantly surprised to see that the prices were more than reasonable, especially considering the fact that it is located inside a Las Vegas Hotel. The employees were all nice..   My kid got their chicken teriyaki bowl which is probably the best deal because the serving is quite generous for a \"bowl\" item. The chicken was cooked well and the sauce was not too salty or heavy. Our table also got spam musubi which you can't really go wrong with. I ordered their Loco Moco and a side of Portuguese sausage. Satisfied with everything. The party was cooked well, egg had that lovely yolk, and the thick sauce complimented the dish without overpowering. The sausage was sliced and caramelized.   Very happy with our lunch choice.   Parking is free if you spend a certain (small) amount in the hotel and get your ticket validated.",

My family is all from Hawaii and it's comforting sitting there hearing pidgeon accents all around me.   There is seating out front in the casino hallway. Theres a snack/candy shop across the way that validates parking, and has awesome Li Hing snacks that we always visit after eating. The restaurant has a decent amount of tables and seats. During the later part of the day/evening the line can get fairly long so I recommend going early.   Everything I have ordered I've loved. The teriyaki beef on my husband's plate is like flattened kalbi and is amazing. The chicken and pork were nothing extraordinary. My kahlua pig and cabbage was spot on and exactly how they make it in Hawaii. The haupia, same thing, perfect custard texture and just a tad of sweetness with a subtle hint of coconut flavor. I've also had the kimchi saimin which is perfect. The spam musubi is ge seriously sized with perfectly textured rice, spam and teri sauce.   Service is always chill and friendly. They bring your food out pretty quick. Give them a try if you haven't.",

The beef though in sauce did not have much taste,,, the chicken was good, i liked it.. tender and moist, it was de-boned thigh,, the fish was ehh,,, rather had extra chicken.. The portion was large, too large for me to finish...  I will try the Mami or Udon noodles next time....  I hesitantly recommend this place...

Ahhh, after a late night of... uh... business stuff, grabbing an early lunch here hit the spot. So much so that I really have a hankering for Hawaiian food and think I need to make some spam musubi for Thanksgiving this year.  Anyways, I had the breakfast plate, my dining partner in crime had the local plate. Both were yummy. Thank goodness I still had a few bucks left over, otherwise this cash only establishment would have seen a grown man cry in line. Either that or bolt out of line to find an ATM.

Moved to Las Vegas in 1991 and I have fond memories of finding the only place in Vegas to grab a saimin or mixed plate was at the California Hotel in a hole in the wall reminiscent of my favorite Mom and Pop joint back in the islands.  Back then there were barely enough seats to call it a sit down restaurant, basically you walked up to a window and got your food to go or waited for a table to clear up.  Surprisingly enough one always did by the time your food was ready.  The Aloha Specialties of 2010 still has that same charm as it did the first time I ate there, with a lot more menu items and few more tables.  There are now 10X the amount of \"Hawaiian Style\" restaurant in LV but I still claim Aloha Specialties as the best in the Desert.  The Mixed Plate is a winner, 2 scoops of rice, mac salad, teri chicken, teri beef, and fried mahi mahi.  Saimin is a staple.  When I am in the mood I will treat myself to a Korean Chicken or Sweet and Sour Spare Ribs.",

Ordered the saimen with wontons, fried saimen, and curry chicken. We all shared so we can try a little bit of each. Saimen and wontons both had no flavor whatsoever, fried saimen tasted nothing like how it should taste (bland, sugary, watery), and curry chicken was HORRID. It was like the left over chicken with skin still left on it. The curry was not strong enough either, so it tasted watery. Just overall BAD experience here. Cheap food, but horrible.",

The staff was really friendly and really quick to get the food out.  We ordered the fried saba which turned out to be a whole half of of a fish with macaroni salad (a Hawaiian tradition) and a few large scoops of rice. It was a really nice change from the 3 inch square of fish that you'll find in most restaurants. We also split the ahi ahi poke, which was under $5 for a bowl filled with ice cube sized fish chunks. The sauce that it was swimming in was a little sweet but the cut of fish was pretty tasty. Some of the other bowls that they were carrying around were the size of a medium pho bowl and other plates were piled high with meats and rice so you can safely assume that you'll get your money's worth.

Aloha Specialties offers what I think of as Hawaiian comfort food: chicken katsu, teriyaki beef and chicken, kalua pork, and that most Hawaiian of foodstuffs - Spam.  Throw in a scoop of macaroni salad and two scoops of rice, and you're in high fat, high carb heaven.  Since this was my first trip to Aloha Specialties, I decided to try one of the standard plate lunches:  chicken katsu, teriyaki beef, Spam musubi, along with the obligatory macaroni salad and rice.  For dessert, haupia.  Chicken katsu is basically breaded and fried chicken, rolled and sliced.  It was OK, but not especially crisp or flavorful.  \"OK\" pretty much described the beef and Spam as well.  Nothing was bad, but it wasn't exciting either.  The haupia (coconut pudding) was downright disappointing.",

As time went on, former islanders would talk about this place and that the food was great. So as a skeptic, I went on my day off. I was in for a surprise! Not only is the food great...but their portions are generous! I really recommend the Korean Beef and Korean chicken combo! I watch the servers pass with the bowls of saimin, yet my friends tell me that \"it's the REGULAR\" then I see a much larger bowl...\"THATS the LARGE!\" All in all, I recommend \"Aloha Specialties\"",

Found the place on yelp (of course), and boy am I glad we did.  This was the first stop to five days worth of eating adventures in Vegas and it was an excellent start!  We shared the kahlua pork and cabbage plate and the aloha special.  Talk about an AMAZING feast.  We've had Hawaiian food a couple times, but nothing as tasty as this place.  We of course left so full it was hard to work (as other reviews note).  I found the kahlua pork to be tender and flavorful - I especially enjoyed when I got a perfect bite containing pork, cabbage, some rice and mac salad... YUM!  My Husband and I really loved the Korean chicken and we loved that is was pretty spicy, but also sweet.  The hot dog, which came on the aloha special was so unique and tasty, he practically inhaled it.  All in all, an excellent find.  If we're downtown again, which I know we will be, we will surely hit up the Aloha Specialties Restaurant- and you should too!",

Although they are here frequently, it has been a couple of years since we've eaten at this restaurant.  I was in the mood for some Saimin so we headed down to meet them here for lunch.  I ordered a small bowl of Saimin ($5.99) and a Teri-Burger ($6.99).  Their definition of \"small\" is Hawaiian Small.....which means H-U-G-E!  The bowl of Saimin was about a 1/2 gallon.  It was tasty as usual.  The Teri-Burger was very good too.....it comes with a side of Macaroni Salad....but I didn't try it, I was too stuffed.  A couple of tips if you are going to visit this place:  - It gets very crowded during Lunch and Dinner hours, so it's best to go between those meal periods.  - It's a self service restaurant where you order at the counter and they either call your number or take it to your table.  - You can order take out.  - There is fresh iced water in jugs on the right side of the restaurant.....I didn't see this and ordered bottled Water.  Overall, it was another good meal at Aloha Specialties....I got my Saimin fix for a while.  Will I return?  You bet I will.",

Worth a shot!  Located upstairs at the California Hotel, it's this cute restaurant, filled with old school tropical themed wallpaper and decor. The service was really polite, and the food? BOMB.  You get alot of food for your money, always a great deal in Vegas, right? I got the Local plate with beef, chicken, this really good sauce, and two spam musubis for about 8 bucks. So filling, and amazingly flavorful. Nothing's too greasy, just ridiculously filling. My friend got the chicken bowl for just 4 dollars and came with about the same amount of food, so that could be even more worth it! But I personally want my spam musubi. Even got another to go! They have a very convenient station with all the to go boxes and foil for your musubi, I think it's a great idea!  Keep in mind it is CASH ONLY. But Luckily, the Casino is right downstairs :)",

It is one of those places that you have to unbutton your pants if you eat your whole plate without taking any home to-go.   I usually order chicken chop steak. Every time it is super fresh! The bean sprouts nice and crisp along with the fresh celery. It tastes like good home cooking. A great portion of meat as well, they definitely don't skimp.  The rice is always spot-on and mac salad to die for! It's like there is some secret ingredient that makes me always want more even after I am stuffed! The bf got bento plate last visit. We have never ordered anything that we turned out NOT to like! Of course as a staple to our meal was the kimchi. MMMMMMMMMMMMM!!!!! A small bowl that seemed to never end. It is delish above the rice as well. Pickled goodness!   I almost feel like this place severely under-charges for the amount and quality of the food. I would gladly pay more. The staff is friendly as well and always helpful if you have any questions or prefer sriracha sauce instead of what is already on the table. The restaurant is always clean, even though they are so busy.",

Beef Teriyaki, Loco Moco, Ribs, Spam Musubi, Portuguese Sausage are all very good choices.

They give you spicy mustard on the side.  I put the whole thing in because I just love the way the spiciness just makes my noise tingle! Hahaha!  If you want wontons in your saimin, it's a bit extra.  I ordered a large and for some reason i thought I'd be able to finish it... not at all!  I had to pack the rest of it up and it still filled the entire container!   Ahi poke is probably the best I've had in a long time.  Tastes very fresh.  The onion pieces were a bit too big than what I would usually like, but I was able to work my way around them.  For $4.95, it's a pretty good portion!  I also ordered a side of kimchee.  Kimchee is good and they give you a pretty good portion of it.  I had to take this to go, too!    Service is O.K.  You pay at the cashier first, then you get a number and a server comes out to bring your food.  It took less than 10 minutes to get my food.  Lesson learned... This place serves up pretty big portions!  Don't order everything you want at once! And also, cash only.",

Now, i'm not Japanese or Hawaiian, but i sure felt like I was home....  Ohana...  Um anyways, the food at the Aloha Specialties restaurant was delicious! It was such a nice change of pace to be off the strip, the vibe was chill, prices weren't inflated; it was just nice to get away from all the lights, loud music, crazy people.  To just sit down and finally eat a meal that wasn't $35 and that was cooked to order, hot and homestyle.   My friends ordered the Loco Moco which was awesome, nice char on the hamburger patties and the sauce didn't taste like normal generic loco moco sauce. I had the spam and shortribs which was also equally awesome. Everything was under $10 and i wanted to order the whole menu.  This was no frills, straight good Hawaiian food, with large portions.   I've never been to downtown Vegas, let alone the California Casino, but i know the California and Aloha Specialties will definitely be on top of the to-do list every time we're back.  Oh, and i won $200 dollars here, which almost felt better than my lunch at Aloha Specialties.",

Looking for eats downtown before hitting up the Fremont street casinos, we headed toward the best-reviewed place in the vicinity. And of course, so did everyone else. This tiny cafeteria-style restaurant is on the second floor of the California Hotel and Casino; a place FILLED with Hawaiians. So far, so good.  There is a long and boisterous line, so you will have plenty of time to decide on your order and discuss life and the menu with strangers in line. I heard lots of passionate opinions about both. After much consultation I decided to get a chicken bowl, with onions and mushrooms.  Sit down after placing your order (the table turnover is pretty quick) and the food is brought to you. It felt like our meals came out in seconds, but then I may have been feeling temporal distortion due to alcohol. It also felt like the food went down in seconds, but that's because it was magically delicious. And it's filling, and it's cheap. Go.  Obligatory Title Pun: It'll BOWL you over.  Menu Readability: Nothing worth mentioning.  Need to mention: This place is cash only.  What this place teaches me about myself: I'll wait in any line if I have had enough to drink.",

    "text": "If I have a craving for hamburger steak there's only one place that comes to mind... and I agree its Aloha specialities!  I usually have the hamburger steak and my lady gets the Korean chicken or saimin. No can wrong with anything plus they get boiled peanuts every now and than amd they are great!! The hamburger is nice an dense flavor is outrageous and taste like your eating a legit piece of steak! The gravy is mean and the mac salad is good. Home cooking that you get to taste and it is awesome! The saimin is so flavorful and brings me straight back home and the korean chicken also has good flavor. A little different as their korean chicken is boneless and I am used to drumsticks but no can complain as its easier to eat lol! Overall in my opinion this place has the best hamburger steak  plate in vegas! Loco mocos is winners too! All Hawaii people must give this place a try and give aloha kitchen one small kine break, aloha specialities is a must try!",

The food at Aloha Specialties is so much more flavorful.  When it gets busy, though, be prepared to wait...both to order your food and for your order to come out.  They should open up another register so that the line to order food doesn't get so long and people don't get restless waiting to order...especially our kupuna.",

If you like ramen or soba, give this a shot.  Korean chicken - What I usually get when I'm not eating saimin.  Again, great flavor and it usually disappears from my plate in less than 10 minutes, enough said.  I would recommend Aloha Specialties to anyone in Vegas looking for good Hawaiian food.  Oh and check out the 808 store right across for the candy (I recommend li hing strawberry belts) and also check out Lappert's ice cream for desert!",

    "text": "I recently visited this place on Sunday Aug 31st with my family. It was the end of our 4-day vacation & I chose this place having cravings for some ono grindz. Of course the line was long, they only take cash, & the waiting period is a bit long. But that wasn't my issue. The waitress service was HORRIBLE! When you place your order, they give you a # for your table so the waitress will match with the order, right? So the waitress brings out what was my family's order but goes to a table next whom JUST sat down & they were a family of 10+ people so I KNEW that couldn't have been their order. Instead of the waitress making sure she had the right table, she starts passing out the 1st dish (loco moco) to that family. When she calls out the 2nd dish (another loco moco), no one ordered it. She THEN REALIZED \"oh wrong table.\" She then comes over to my family & puts down all the food, minus my order of loco moco. When I ask her about it, she lightly brushes it off & says \"its coming.\" Walks away. 15-20min later, she brings the other family's food, but STILL no loco moco. I held my patience long enough, I go up to the front & before I am able to talk to the head person, she comes & says their cooking it now. I told her off politely that it was her mistake & not mines & now I can't enjoy my meal with the rest of my family whom is already done with their food smh. So when my food was ready, instead of her bringing it, she sends the other waitress over with my food! No apology, no complimentary, something!  I feel bad because the food is good but that one waitress is careless & can't own up to her mistake. The food was good besides that. My family enjoyed it being that they rarely eat Hawaiian dishes. I don't know if I'll come back again if I'm in the area..maybe I will but will make sure I won't get the same waitress..",

You can taste the quality and the freshness of the food and the price is super affordable for the amount of food they give you. I tried their garlic chicken and it was the best I've ever had, the skin was crispy even with the gravy on top, but the inside was tender and juicy. The only thing I don't really like about this place is that it's cash only, but luckily it's located in a casino so you can easily find an ATM.

My party ordered the Teri Beef Sandwhich, Aloha Buntie and the Sweet & Sour ribs. All the meat was fatty and not of good quality. Yes, I agree it is cheap and you do seem to get enough food, but it was awful. The reviews mentioned the Teriyaki which to me was very sweet and tasted like it came out of can. Seriously people this is what you have resorted to as good food. GROSS. I will never eat here again or recommend to anyone. There are SO many other good places to eat in Vegas do not waste your time. Also, what restaurant doesn't take credit cards. Its the 21st century get with the program, its called running a business. Idiots!!!!",

A nice lady walked us to the right corridor and we quickly found the Aloha.   We had spent a few hours wandering in the Valley of Fire, so we were starving! We over ordered and had way too much food for two people. The Aloha Saimin was delicious, they don't skimp on the fixings or noodles. The spam musubi is huge, warm, and the rice was perfectly sticky. The ahi poke isn't made with the highest grade of tuna, but they give big chunks of it in a salty soy sauce. The steak plate lunch was ok, the steak was tough, but it's cheap, so you get what you pay for. The place reminds me of the hole in the wall places we eat at home. The smoke in the Californian is a bit overwhelming, but that's what you expect in an old hotel in Vegas. I'd definitely come back here again. The place was busy the entire time we were there, people know it's a good deal.   Park in the Californian garage, then get your parking ticket validated downstairs by the main cage. There's a little machine that you stick the ticket in, it will save you a few bucks.",

This goes back to how much I did not enjoy paying for going out to eat in California, because it is always so expensive. I originally heard about this Hawaiian restaurant from a Teriyaki Hawaiian Restaurant owner / chef friend from California. He had stayed at the California hotel, which is where this place is located, and decided to act on his recommendation. Good thing I did! I have been eating here for over a year and they only have raised prices once to an acceptable level. I always get the flash combo bowl chicken no skin & beef on a mound of sticky white rice. I then order a small saimin, which is huge, if I'm still hungry or if I want to share it. Two things that could make this restaurant a home run, accept credit & debit cards & have a healthy brown rice upgrade option. They promptly close, so be on time!",

So when i came to downtown to gamble and eat, the first placed we stopped was here. It's nice how it's right between the Californian and Main Street. When i got there it was around 6pm and there was a line and i was in the line for a good 10 mins. I think the kitchen can take so many orders at one time since it's such a small place. The place was pretty packed but i managed to find a booth after i ordered.   I order the Large Saimin and some ahi poke to go along with it. It tasted really good and i enjoy eating saimin everytime i eat it. I was pretty hungry and i ended up having some ahi poke left because there was more noodles in the saimin than i thought. My friend got the Kim Chi saimin and she said that it was good. I don't really like kim chi so i could not tell you how it tasted. The saimin came rally fast too so the service was good even though it was crowded.   The little restaurant has a nice Hawaiian theme. Lots of flowers and colorful booths. It's too bad it closes early though, i think at 9pm.   I just wish it was closer to the strip and opened later so i could sober up with a bowl of saimin...",

Interesting... Anyways, Aloha Specialties is decent size that can seat about 100 people or so. Surprisingly they need it cuz the line is always out the door. We waited about 15 minutes to put our order in and then another 10 minutes for them to bring it out to our table. The food is amazing and the dishes are about $7 each. They have a huge selection and since we couldnt order the whole menu, we decided on: The Beef Stew, Korean Beef and Korean Chicken, and the Special Mix Plate. I would definitely come eat here again.",

Went with the Loco Moco & Spam Musubi. The Loco Moco was good - hand-made patty, OK gravy & just enough rice. The slice of Spam was on the thin side.  Friend had chicken/beef teri. The plate came out with a big empty spot. Why didn't they spread out the meat (well, not too much to begin with), rice or mac salad to fill the gaping hole? The meats are cooked with teri sauce on top. They're not marinated and then cooked. Why not a potato/mac salad? It was bland.   After all the hype I had to try it out. I'll wait 'til I get home to get some local grinds.",

I'll even snake your table, call in my food order on the phone instead of waiting in that long line.  I'll get my food quicker than you, one way or another.   SUCKA!  Where's the Aloha, Love?

    "text": "After a long wait to pay a ticket at the court house, I decided to end my downtown trip on a high note by trying Aloha Specialties Restaurant.    On the second floor of the California Hotel and Casino, the restaurant's location and kitschy Hawaiian decor made me question my decision almost as much as the nearly empty dining area.  Determined, I went to the counter and ordered ahi poke, kim chee saimin, and spam musubi.  After a helpful and welcomed proper pronunciation lesson from a friendly man behind the counter, I took a seat at a near by booth and awaited my food.  Everything came out quickly, starting with the poke that was shortly followed by my saimin and spam musubi.  Considering that I only spent $12 for my meal, everything was generously portioned and could have easily been shared by two people.  Although the ahi in the poke wasn't the best I ever had, it was a great value for $4.75 and was served in a nice green onion-soy sauce.  The saimin bowl was enormous!  Soft squares of tofu, melt-in-your-mouth pieces of beef, yummy kim chee, and noodles float in a savory, slightly spicy broth that is sure to delight any saimin fan.  And, at $5.75, it's easy going on your wallet.  The spam musubi was also very good, but you really can't go wrong with grilled spam and rice wrapped in nori.  All in all a very nice lunch experience and something to keep in mind next time I'm in the Fremont Street area!",

Some other items that we get when we come here: Loco Moco, Ahi Poki, and Spam Masubi. Get a couple spam masubis they are good to have for a snack.   For dessert you can get Lappert's ice cream right across the hallway!  The restaurant can get busy but their service is fast and tables free up all the time.   I always miss Hawaii when I come here!

My chicken plate as huge! It was cooked to perfection.  Crispy on the outside and juicy on the inside. I could not eat it all but wanted to. A really great and tasty meal!

Haupia ($1.25): I only had one bite of the haupia. I could kinda taste the coconut and it was kinda good.  Fruit punch: I love drinking fruit punch with my Hawaiian food.   A little piece of HAWAII inside the CALIFORNIA hotel in LAS VEGAS. What more can you ask? Too bad they were out of the oxtail soup when I was there.   4 stars!!

Located on the mezzanine floor is this awesome Hawaiian restaurant that feels like Hawaii in a nutshell. Spam, they got it. Saimen, they got it. Loco moco, definitely got it.

They ran out on some stuff while we were ordering. It's different that when ordering a plate you get rice, however if you get spam musubi that is considered your rice. I prefer to eat my Hawaiian style dish with just rice.   We ordered their special, it has fish, pork and chicken, we were given rice but my sister who ordered the local plate did not. They asked for it but they told her no and said that's what her spam musubi is for.   The taste of everything was alright. I thought it was okay. If you're a local (lived in hawaii) though like my sister and bro-in law, you will be highly disappointed. Some people may like it because there are not alot of options probably.

There is always a wait to order and the line is horrendous. You'll have at least 20 minutes to look around and stare at the menu on the wall while you're in line.  Definitely order a bowl of the traditional Hawaiian favorite - saimin and add some wontons to it. It's a good size bowl that might be large enough to split if you're ordering a few spam musubi.  I also tried the chicken teriyaki bowl. A mix of dark meat and chicken breast with its crispy chicken skin covered in a light glaze. A solid, familiar choice in a menu full of comfort food.  Reasonably priced, located in downtown at the California Hotel on the second floor. Oh, and it's CASH ONLY!",

We both had the teriyaki combination plate, which comes with chicken, steak, and pork, white rice, and a small macaroni side salad. The teriyaki sauce was tasty, but the meat portions were small and a little gristly and the chicken thigh was cooked with the skin and fat (which I typically don't eat). The macaroni salad was pretty good.",

They have a really good selection to choose from. They have all the local favorites.   The only draw back is that this place can get supwr busy at peak times and it might take awhile to get your food. But that is because this place has delicious food.  I am definitely a fan of this place and would recommend it to anyone!",

I tried to call in order, while we stood in line, but no one answered the whole time we waited. I saw the girl at register answer 2 calls, before I tried and saw other ppl walk in to pick up phone orders. When we finally ordered, I asked if I had the right number. She says, we don't answer the phone when it's busy??? Well, she did answer a few calls. It seemed like they have no sense of urgency. Actually had a party of four women, before us all order separately....Really. They stood there and literally ordered one at a time waiting behind the line??? Come on ppl, don't be difficult. How hard is it to order together and figure out the total? SMH...Next time, if we can't order by phone for pick up, forget this place.",

We're all from Hawaii, but currently live in the Pacific Northwest so this restaurant is a little taste of home. I've tried multiple things here over the past several years, but my favorite is the Aloha Bento. The korean chicken and teri beef are super ono! I also get a spam musubi every time I come here, but I save the musubi to eat as a snack at a later time cause the portions here more than enough for me to eat in one sitting. The portions here definitely make the price worth it.  The only reason why I am giving 4 stars instead of 5 is because it always takes a while to place an order and to get your food. There's often a long line, which makes the long wait for the food to come out understandable. However, on my last visit, there were only 3 other people in front of me and the line moved slower than ever. I'm not sure if I went at a time when they didn't have as many workers, but everything took a really long time.  Even if I know the line is gonna take forever and I'm gonna end up waiting for a while to get my food, I can guarantee you that I will eat here every time I stay in downtown Vegas.",

    "text": "Stayed at the Downtown Grand Hotel during my business trip in Las Vegas and was looking for something casual/interesting to try.  This Hawaiian joint is located inside the California Hotel, on the 2nd floor. It took me awhile to find the place because all of the signs on the casino level just has arrows pointing to a very general label of \"restaurants.\" Finally, I bumped into an employee who pointed me the right place.   Went on a Wednesday afternoon, around 4pm. Really empty. I find the menu a little confusing, hard to tell what each item actually comes with. After some thinking, I went with the Loco Moco and two spam musubis. The cashiers were all very warm and welcoming, made it a very pleasant experience. I took my order to-go.  Loco Moco was delicious. The hamburger patty was a little dry, but I find that it had flavor even without the gravy. I like that the gravy is not overpowering or overly salty; it complemented the hamburger patty very well. Sadly, the over easy eggs were more over medium/fried. When I broke open the eggs, barely any yolk came out... so disappointed!!! Musubi is good, definitely hit the spot with the teriyaki sauce.  Very happy I got to try this place, highly recommend it!!",

They serve the typical breakfast foods while offering other non-traditional breakfast meats like Tocino, Portuguese sausage, and spam.  They have graveyard specials at 11:00p like oxtail soup, chicken fingers with fries for $5, and other goodies.  I like getting their chili with rice, one of their souls with noodles and meat, or one of the above mentioned breakfast meats with rice and eggs. I also love their oxtail soup the portion is large and the broth is so flavorful.  Service is friendly but the servers are always so busy as the place usually has a line. Be prepared to ask for everything you need as soon as possible. I usually don't see anyone after our food is set down.  The price is right, the non-traditional Asian items are welcome, and the service with a smile are why I frequent this establishment over other cafes and diners.",

Another great thing about it being in California Hotel, if they're closed, you can always go downstairs to the cafe for some late night oxtail soup! Mmmmm. But anyway about Aloha Specialities, it does suck that they take cash only but I'm always prepared before I come there. And sometimes during lunch, the line is ridiculously long, I hate waiting! Though it's a small little place everyone always fills this place up. So my favorite dish is the Korean Chicken, it has the perfect kick of spicy and the perfect crunch of crunchy!! Melts in your mouth and not only that but some mac salad on the side. I also like getting the Beef Chop Steak, it has lots of veggies when I feel like having a dose of veggies. Boyfriend likes the Chicken Curry, and damn is it good, nice and creamy with some rice mixed in! The portions are so big, I can't finish my whole plate, I end up eating all the chicken and leave out the rice. I only wish they were open a little bit later!! But overall my fav place for hawaiian food. ! : )",

I think we could have squeezed in with another family since there was just 2 of us. Hubby found a seat and I ordered as I'm more familiar with this type of food. Line took a while to get through. About 30 minutes to be exact. Got a large saimen with veggies on the side, Kim chee, Mac salad and, musubi. Everything was Delish. Wasn't fond of the Mac salad. It was like a heart attack waiting to happen. Noodles and mayo (lots of mayo). My favorite item was the musubi. The soup was really big enough for 2 almost. There was a self serve water station that was stocked with \"to go\" boxes too. The staff was working hard to get everyone fed. The kitchen staff seemed to be on the ball. Poor guy in the back (Jordan) put up the wrong soup while I was in line and apologized like they were gonna whip him later. Would have given 5 stars had the line moved faster and there were more places to sit. I would visit again for sure.",

Granted the prices have gone up a bit since my last stop but in honesty who's hasn't? As for the food this round, the Saimin wasn't that outstanding and was too heavily fishy and salty for my taste. The noodles were great but the musubi more than made up for it. And hey, my husband enjoyed his loco moco and I certainly can't hate a place that serves spam and rice.",

    "text": "Even though we had meal vouchers, I decided to spring for lunch and treat my family after winning a few on the $.25 machines. I kept reading about this place on yelp and wanted to try it on this past trip.  I had the Korean fried chicken plate. It was like BBQ chicken with a Korean twist. They give 3 thighs and it was tasty. The skin was crunchy too. The mac salad, however, wasn't so great. It was too mayonnaise-y and tasted like mayonnaise is all they put in it, no other seasonings. I should have stayed with the Korean theme and ordered a side of kim chee instead.   My parents ordered saimin and I had a taste of the noodles. They tasted freshly made and the portions are huge! It costs extra to add on wonton and vegetables.   I was afraid to, but I went off on a limb and also ordered the ahi poke. I live in Waipahu,HI and compare poke to Tanioka's so, especially on the mainland, I am afraid to try raw fish. I do not like frozen fish and hate getting upset stomachs. To my surprise the ahi was fresh! I do not like limu too much but there wasn't too much of it. The only thing I didn't like about the poke were the huge cubes. They could have cut them a little smaller and it could have soaked up more flavor from the shoyu, onions, etc. The onion slices are large, too. It was pretty good besides that.   While we were eating, I saw an order of musubis come out and could tell they are made to order; the nori was still crunchy looking (just how I like it)  instead of wet from the rice and moisture.   Although it is not advertised, they offer free refills on the beverages. You just have to bring your cup to the counter. Also, they have take out boxes and bowls already out along with complimentary water and foil so you don't have to ask. Overall, everything we had was delicious and I will be back to try other things next time.",

What made it even more pleasant was a nice little Hawaiian lady asked to join me at my big table.  She sat down with her \"small\" noodle soup which was massive.  We chatted for awhile and she said I eat Japanese food like a pro!  That always touches me, since I am neither Japanese nor Hawaiian.  I will definitely return.

    "text": "Located inside the California Hotel in downtown Las Vegas. What a gem. This place has the best Hawaii type food outside of Hawaii. Had the Aloha bento ($8.95), large saimen add wonton ($7.00) and ahi poke ($4.95). All very tasty and portions are huge! The Aloha bento is on their special menu and consist of teri beef, korean chicken, mahi mahi and hot dog on rice with furikaki and some little side stuff like fish cakes and takuan --the highlight was definitely the korean chicken. The ahi poke had huge chunks of fish, super fresh, as good as poke from Hawaii --had a little too much onions and not enough limu but the freshness and quality of the fish more than made up for it. I originally hesitated with the ahi poke just because I thought it might be grey and stinky but it was far from that and definitely exceeded my expectations. Last but not least, the saimen really hit the spot on a cold winter day. Probably would skip the wonton next time, I thought the wrapper was too thick and doughy.  This place is nothing fancy...very casual, friendly staff, tables have cheesy hawaiian print plastic covers. The wait for the cashier to take orders is slow sometimes as she is also pushing food out from the kitchen and making people's drinks. Come here for good food, nothing more, nothing less. Cash only.",

Inexpensive and good. Never mind the wait in line. Everyone has to wait a lil bit to order their food.  I usually order the local plate. This includes beef & chicken teriyaki, 2 spam musubis and some macaroni salad. This order does NOT come with rice but that's okay because in my opinion, the spam musubis they make here come with WAY too much rice action. I usually pair this order with a wonton min (saimin noodle soup that comes with char siu pork & steamed wontons). Very good. This is a large soup order and can be shared... The garlic chicken is also a DELISH order of a meal. Tastes real good.  Don't forget the extra large fruit punch with your meal. You're gonna need it.",

Haven't tried everything but every time I come I order the teriyaki bowl (that comes with white rice). This is huge and the beef is sooo tender and the teriyaki sauce is sweet but not over powering. I love it! It tastes soooo good. maybe someday I'll take a chance and order something else.  Least favorite thing about this place is that they accept cash only! How inconvenient!

I average one Vegas trip a month and always find my way here at least once every trip. They have lots of variety on their menu & I don't think i've ever tasted a bad entree.   I usually order one of the meat combos because they load up your plate pretty well. I like the Bento Plate for about $8-$9 which includes: BBQ Beef, Korean Chicken, Mahi-Mahi, with Furakake Rice.. each respectively tasting amazing. The Loco Moco is also a good goto dish which never fails in satisfying a craving, and curing a hangover from a long night of partying.

The last few times I've been here the portion is extremely small. Before they gave 7-8 decent size chunks but the last few times I got 3. Wtf is going on?? Also it's $9.99 now. The steak is even worse. For $6.99 it came with super oily and soggy fries. Let your fryer heat up before cooking fries!! The veggies are oily as well. The steak have a bunch of gristle and tendon.   Also the service is always bad here. They would literally take your order and drop it off. They never come check up on you or even refill your drinks. I'm sticking to south point from now on for my grave yard specials. Steak is only $4.99 there and the burger special is $3.75",

I love there Won-ton min (sorry if spelling is wrong). I also love there Spam Musubi and mac salad. There saimin is also very delicious. They recently updated this restaurant also. It is more modern now. I bought a lot of food for myself and the wife and the total was under $22.00 both times we went. I look forward to my next trip to Vegas to stop by this establishment. Great job!",

We ordered the saimin, Kim chee, and spam musubi. It only took a few minutes to get our food. It was all good. The char siu with the hot mustard was very nice. The noodles were good too, and plenty long. Kim chee was especially good. The musubi was like I always remembered. Nothing fancy, but a good value of familiar tastes. Cost for two came to $15.00.  The remodel brightened it up a bit. And it was clean. Menu seemed to be pretty much the same as before. Service quick, although  the place had few customers early on. I can't say anything bad about this place. Next time I'll order some boiled peanuts...",

Heading over here we did pass by the \"Pawnstars\" shop & the wedding chapel that they used for \"The Hangover.\" Pretty cool! Also the self-proclaimed \"World's Biggest Souvenir Shop.\" Place was HUUUUGE! So I wouldn't doubt the name at all.  Walking into the hotel this restaurant was located in was AWKWARD. Apparently that hotel attracts the OLDER crowd. I didn't see anyone our age at all. What made it eve more AWKWARD was that we were dressed in clubbing clothes so all the older people were staring at us like we were hookers or something. lol. Walking into the restaurant got us lots of stares since we were severely over-dressed & looked out of place. Besides that, here goes my experience.  I ordered the chicken teriyaki, musubi combo. It comes with 2 MUSUBI'S! Yummy! The macaroni salad was sooooo good! The chicken teriyaki, WOW. They were not stingy when it came to portions. I ate as much as I could since we were going to be drinking alot that night & it still looked like I didn't even put a dent into it.  The prices are unbelievably low. I guess going off the strip makes things a little cheaper.  I would go here again, just sayin'",

They wdont seem to be in any particular hurry, but considering the kitchen can only move so fast, I don't blame them. It takes quite some time to get food, but it's worth it. The serving size is more than plentiful, and the flavors are full. Overall, if you're in a rush, skip it, but if you've got time, the flavors worth the wait.",

Located in the California Hotel on the upper level above the Casino, the Aloha Specialties Restaurant will be a place I visit for a comforting meal now and then. Both, my dinner buddy and I had the Teriyaki Salmon with White Rice and macaroni salad. We added a couple of over easy fried eggs and boom.. delicious! :)   Easy ordering at the front counter from the cashier style system.. order, they give you a number, you choose a table, they bring you your food. The delivery was with a smile and was pretty fast. Food was generous in portion and flavors were great. For the two of us with both dinners and 2 bottles of water.. around $25 before tax. Not bad at all.. we were both full. So if you are in the area, and want some delicious grub, drop in to Aloha Specialties Restaurant! Happy Eating!",

    "text": "This place still gets the same amount of stars since my last review, but I feel I need to talk about my last experience there.  Unfortunately, it wasn't that great.  It wasn't the food.  The food was amazing as always.  And the service (once you do order your food) is pretty quick.  Honestly, turnaround here is pretty fast considering how many people they go through.  No, my experience had to deal with customers.  And maybe there's something the restaurant can do about it.  The seating here is basically, seat yourself.  But with such a small seating area, and a line that is usually out the door, sometimes it may get a little hard to find a seat.  But as I said, turnaround is pretty quick at this restaurant, and usually it works out well where there can be a constant flow of customers without too much \"I can't find a table to sit at\" distress.  However, on this past experience, the line was all the way to the escalator.  A party that had about 20 people decided to save seats when they were clearly at the end of the line, no where near ordering.  By the time we had ordered and gotten our food, we lucked out finding a place to sit, but alas, only 4 seats for 5 people.  We kindly asked these other customers if we could borrow a seat while they waited for the rest of their party to order, but they rudely declined.  Only after my friend asked a second time did they begrudgingly let us \"borrow\" a chair.  Long story short, we finished our food, and this party that had taken up 3-4 large tables still hadn't even ordered yet!  What was most disheartening was that you could see older people start to look for tables to sit at, and there was no where for them to sit because of this large party.  How to possibly fix this problem?  Possibly make it a courteous rule that you can't \"reserve\" a spot until you get your number/order your food.  That way, the people who are eating can actually sit down and eat.  And of course, this doesn't happen all the time.  In this instance, it was really the customers who were rude.  But sometimes, it would be nice for the establishment to step in and let them know it's not cool to reserve that many spots when they clearly weren't even close to ordering yet.  Overall, their food is still bomb, and it a Vegas trip really is complete with a trip to this place.  I won't let this one sour experience deter me.",

The friendly woman made conversation and also brought out the food.   Food: we had the hamburger steak ($9.95), the portion was huge and the gravy was delicious but the hamburger was dry and had way too much pepper in it. Also some of the rice was super hard, like rock hard. It is not as good as we remember it to be. My son had the musubi and liked the Teri sauce on it. Soda is free refills, that was really good.   Prices: it has gone up but the portions are huge and are worth it.   Overall: will probably return and maybe eat Saimin the next time",

Hunny & I split the local plate. Quality wasn't as great as I remember - the spam musubi didn't have enough sauce and my beef teri was cold. Overall, probably just an off night, and we would give them another try if we were downtown.",

Despite the undesirable smell of cigarette smoke once you enter the casino to get here, I would say it is worth it to try them out.  Overall rating is a solid 3.5 stars.  I wanted so much to fall in love with their garlic fried chicken.  I loved loved their gravy but I seriously did not taste any garlic on them chicken! =/ Their Portuguese sausage was yum alongside their musubi.  In fact, we ordered extra musubi to take with us.   Definitely you get the ohana feeling seeing how the staff works together.   It's a very laid back feel.  I need to go back and give them another try!",

This place is your typical Hawaiian diner.  It's probably the best thing you can have at the Cal and Main without having to leave the hotels.  The food here is really good. But the service is super slow.  The people work like on Hawaiian time, never in a rush. But that doesn't stop the line going out the door.  mac salad - a little on the heavier mayo side but really good spam musubi - too much rice to spam ratio but you can never go wrong with a spam musubi. and it's 2.50. a great snack breakfast spam, eggs, and rice - nothing too fancy but it's fantastic in my opinion mixed vegetables - mix of cabbage, bean sprouts, and celery (just an fyi) teriyaki chicken and gravy bowl - super basic. the gravy is not too thick. i wish they didn't leave the skin on the chicken and that the chicken was a little more crispier.",

There is typically always a wait here, but before they would get through the line quickly and have the food out in no time. This last trip it took 45 minutes to wait in line to order my food. After that was another 20 minutes until my food was served.  I could have used this time to gamble :) This is not a sit down restaurant where a server comes and takes your order. It's like an L&L where you place your own order at the register and they give you a number, so that was a pretty long wait. Previously the entire process would be no more than 20 minutes.   Besides the wait, the food was still just as good as before. Although they removed some of their options from their menu, their Loco Moco is still to die for. For their low prices, you get great tasting food in large quantities.  I'll probably give them another chance, but if they are just as long as the last time, I probably wouldn't wait.",

We were hangry so I immediately know where to eat in California hotel but YELP wanted to suggest Aloha Specialties because it was new so we immediately agreed to go here instead. Well it definitely did not disappoint!  I got the saimin, 2 musubis, and haupia while my other half got the aloha bento special and side mac salad. The ladies at the counter took our orders really quick and everyone there was so nice and you can feel as if you're home away from home. They gave us a number and we sat down. They brought us our food right away and we started to eat as if we haven't ate for days. The saimin bowl was huuuuuuge! His aloha bento was stacked with meat, the two musubis were big, and the haupia slice was huge also! Everything was delicious and definitely comfort food. We were so full so we saved the musubis for later when we get hungry from walking all over the place. Prices are reasonable and portions are great! We will be back next time we visit.",

Somehow, my mom convinced us to dine here this past Sunday during one of the busiest weekends of the year in Downtown Las Vegas. We made our way to The Cal, which by the way is THE hotel to stay in if you're from Hawai'i, in case you didn't know. Vegas isn't nicknamed the 9th Island for no apparent reason, people! We reached the top of the escalator and my god, I've never seen a line so long for a plate lunch!  This was my first time dining at Aloha Specialties, so I wasn't too sure if the line was always this long or if it was just because we were waiting with a third of the festival goers from Life Is Beautiful. We patiently waited for about 45 minutes or so before placing our order, but I didn't mind because it gave my indecisive ass some time to figure out what I was in the mood for.   I was back and forth between the Hamburger Steak with grilled onions or the Spicy-Korean Chicken. My sister ended up ordering the Spicy-Korean Chicken and I figured I could just sample hers and order my Hamburger Steak! Winning!  The portions at Aloha Specialties are more than generous. Let's just say that I couldn't even see my plate because it was completely covered with rice and brown gravy. I love my rice, I'm Filipino for crying out loud! But I personally think that my plate came with way too much rice. Not to mention the size of the Hamburger Steak was about the size of the plate. Talk about overwhelming! The Hamburger Steak was thin and crispy, just how I like it, but it could've used a little salt. There's no way I would be able to finish my meal alone. Can you say kanak attack?  Spicy-Korean Chicken- Not your typical Korean fried chicken! Aloha Specialities nailed it with this one. The chicken is extremely flavorful and moist, but the best part is the crispiness of the skin!   My mom swears by their saimin! I tried some of the broth and it was just okay to me. Not the best, but it wasn't bad either. There was a big variety of vegetables in it too.  As a (now) Vegas local, I appreciate the fact that there are many options to choose from when I'm missing the flavors of the islands and Aloha Specialties is now on my go-to list for when I'm craving a taste of home. I would highly recommend this joint to everyone. Great food and friendly service.   Shoot, even the Hawai'i locals can't stay away from the food when on vacation here in Las Vegas! Needless to say, the line is worth it.",

The chicken was good, but the beef could have been better. The musubi was warm and yummy. The Korean chicken was just spicy enough with rice. Food was good.  The restaurant is located in the second floor off the Cailfornia. It has one register and you get in line to order. The menu is on the wall and clear for you to see and order from. Be prepared to wait since it is cooked when you order it.",

Me and my husband shared a Local Plate, that came with two spam masubi's, teriyaki chicken and beef and mac salad.  We also shared a wonton saimin soup.  It was a huge bowl and we didn't even finish it.  I'm not too crazy about the wontons but the saimin broth and noodle was very yummy.  This place is very busy.  You line up and order your food then you grab your seat.  The turn over is very fast lots of people eating here and the wait is worth it.  The price of our bill was only $20 and we were stuffed.   Dont' forget to save your receipt to get your parking validated.",

My friend's spam musubi didn't have mushy rice but 1 of my 2 was. And my combo plate had. Wed that was overlooked and cut in small bits. The Portuguese sausage never disappoints but really can't mess that up too much when cooking it.   The service is always spot on. So I always have mixed feelings. There just isn't an option like it in Vegas and sometimes you want homecooked food.   Renovated interior but food could still use an upgrade.",

I also had a bite of my girlfriends teriyaki combo plate. Which is 3 different meats covered in teriyaki sauce. I should say I had more than 1 bite because that was so good as well. Oh and the plates are huge so you'll have plenty leftovers.  The staff was very fast and friendly. The restaurant itself was pretty big and very clean.

I wish they opened a little earlier and stayed open a little later, but it's well worth a little extra planning to hit this place to satisfy your cravings.  The Aloha Combos, Island Favorites and Noodles make for a perfect meal. If I am in the area just after 9 (opening time) it makes for a great breakfast as well. Service can be a little slow, but that's mostly because the food comes out fresh. All the food is available to go as well. I often find myself picking something up to stash in the room for later when staying at the CAL. They close at 9, except Friday and Saturday when they are open an hour later. The staff is always friendly and the prices are very fair.",

Portion sizes are huge and I took over half of my food in a to-go box. Two people could certainly split one of these plates. My only complaint is that the mahi mahi was over-cooked and dry, but the taste and cooking of the rest of the meats and sides made up for that.",

    "text": "Affordable, filling, unique...this is the place to hang out after some late night gambling and strolling on Fremont Street Experience.  The small quaint store is located inside the California Hotel on the top floor. It's not a place to be missed with its bright open French doors and some \"outside\" seating.  I ordered the local plate consisting of teriyaki beef& chicken, rice, mac salad, and musubi. I also ordered a side of coconut haupia for dessert.  The teriyaki sauce was plentiful, sweet, and savory. It pairs wonderfully with the marinated beef, chicken, and white rice.   Next comes the musubi which is basically nori wrapped around white rice slathered with teriyaki sauce and spam. Despite the simplicity of this food, the sweet teriyaki sauce and the saltiness of the spam with the rice combines wonderfully. Additionally, the crispy nori yields a snappy crunch as you bite into the soft warm rice.  Next comes the mac salad which is macaroni mixed with celery, mayo, and carrot shreds. The mac salad is creamy, sweet, and cold. It's a surprisingly delightful contrast to the main course and provides the warm and salty tongue a rest.  At last comes the coconut haupia (by the way, I'm filled to the brimmed with food at this point). The coconut haupia has an interesting jello/pudding texture and oozes of coco-nutty aroma. The sweet and creamy dessert is extraordinarily light even though it was made with coconut milk.  In conclusion, this place is worth a visit for a taste of simplicity, warmth, and no-frill home cooked Hawaiian meal.",

Coming from Louisiana, going here was something foreign to me, and if it wasn't for my uncle, I wouldn't have known anything about it! I came hungry, empty stomach, and craving something filling! As I read through fellow yelp reviews, I noticed one thing out of everything, the Loco Moco...  Drizzled in gravy, topped with a fried egg, and what seems to be pork or meat loaf over a bed of rice. This was like HEAVEN. If you're hungry and in the mood for something with an explosion of flavors, do yourself a favor and order it. Loco Moco. Write it down. Memorize it. Love it. Feel it. Eat it.   Other then that, the restaurant is located inside of a casino so sitting outside of the restaurant is optional, but it might be a little intoxicating due to the heavy amounts of tobacco smoke coming from everyone else. So, if you have kids or just can't handle the smell of tobacco (don't worry, I can't either), sit inside and enjoy your meal!",

    "text": "Saw the high Yelp reviews for this place, and we were staying in the adjoining Main Street Station, so we ended up in here for dinner one night.  We got there around 7, and there was a line of maybe a dozen folks ahead of us.  I had the saimin (good, but nothing special), as well as the garlic chicken.  GF got the combo plate that had Korean beef and chicken, along with the obligatory rice and macaroni salad.  This isn't fine dining by any stretch - presentation isn't really a concern, and we're not talking about any crazy complimentary flavors or subtle undertones or anything.  Portions are large - GF and I could easily have just split the combo plate and been more than full.  Solid, stick-to-your-ribs, Hawaiian style food.  The beef and chicken were solid, maybe a bit fatty, but that's to be expected.  Cash only was a bit of a surprise, but fortunately I hadn't handed over all my money on the blackjack tables.  This is one of those places that looks like a hole in the wall, but looks like it's always packed.  Large portions and great bang for the buck.  Not amazing food, but a great value, especially if you're craving Hawaiian style.",

This past time I ordered the aloha breakfast which came with eggs, rice, spam, Portuguese sausage and what they call luncheon meat. Very filling meal and if youre in the mood for breakfast it hits the spot. The spam was  not too soft had a slight crisp to it (just the way I like it) and the Portuguese sausage had goof flavor. The luncheon meat was interesting. I would compare it to a thick piece of bologna.   You seat yourself here and order at the cashier. There's only one cashier so when it gets busy you may have to wait. They only accept cash here so dont be coming in with a credit card. But then again you're at a casino so getting money shouldn't be an issue.",

My girlfriend and I ordered the loco moco and the aloha breakfast. The loco moco came with 2 eggs over a beef looking Patty on a bed of rice surrounded in some curry sauce. I somewhat enjoyed the dish, but the patty was not to flavorful to satiate my taste buds. I'd honestly rate the loco moco 3/5. The aloha breakfast came with a medley of meats. The Portuguese sausage was very very flavorful. I thought the luncheon meat was spam, but it was something different. Very sweet and delicious. Then the last piece of meat spam. My honest rate on the aloha breakfast would be a hard 5/5.   Very delicious indeed. Only reason I went 4/5 stars was the taste factor. I usually eat a bit salty so could be the reason why.",

I mean Korean chicken at a Hawaiian restaurant? I guess! It literally tasted like my mom's (Vietnamese) chicken but sweeter. Which of course isn't bad but I was really expecting something amazing, especially with all of the reviews. The portions are very generous, however. You will have to share or have lots of leftovers ! (Which is always nice). I wish this place had katsu but it doesn't. Their spam masubi was meh; seaweed was too hard to bite through. Also their Mac salad. MAC SALAD. Super generous portions but super bland. You're just eating mayo !",

Their prices hasn't gone up also so that was another plus. Their saimen I like better than ...Hamura's in Lihue. There's really nothing out of the ordinary here  (they have the usual spam musubi, saimen, beef and chicken teri, etc) Here's a pic of the menu board: <a href=\"http://static.px.yelp.com/bphoto/qvQzbFx1S0UsjpyoynUB3w/l\">static.px.yelp.com/bphot...</a>  I would give them 3 stars but then I realized that I had this place on speed dial from my previous phone, I knew either I had a eating problem or this place has really been good to me.  Well....some of you know I have an eating problem, but that's another story.   Came this past weeknd and got: Chicken over rice bowl: $2.95 Way better than Yoshinoya! <a href=\"http://static.px.yelp.com/bphoto/yIVwT3rB4Lku5L5f42QIIw/l\">static.px.yelp.com/bphot...</a>  Saimen with Wonton: $3.50+ $1.50 Their wonton is all meat, no veggies and no shrimp. However, it goes great with their saimen and stock. <a href=\"http://static.px.yelp.com/bphoto/UjWkBFHWlTZ40FYZQfqVHA/l\">static.px.yelp.com/bphot...</a>  Garlic chicken with Gravy: $7.00 Same chrispy skinned chicken but with gravy. Heart attack on a plate! <a href=\"http://static.px.yelp.com/bphoto/qU2NbGvPCb53QxF78T_7Zw/l\">static.px.yelp.com/bphot...</a>  Haupia: $1.25.

I got the Aloha Bento for $8.75!  Man this plate is AH-MAZE-ING!  Let's start with a bed of rice, seasoned with furikake, a seaweed seasoning.  Then you have Teriyaki beef, Korean chicken, Redondo red hot dog and mahi mahi.  My gosh!  Worth every penny.  Let's start with the tender and nicely grilled Teriyaki beef.  The sauce really makes it taste like home.  Then you have the hotdog, sliced in half and grilled.  This hot dog is only embraced in Hawaii.  I grew up on this and love it!  It's red, which is weird to some, but awesome to others!  Then the Korean chicken was super flavorful.  Grilled chicken thigh.  The sauce seemed to stick well and such a nice tangy taste to it!  Last but not least, the mahi mahi was breaded with egg and topped with a light tartar sauce. Probably the best part of the dish.  I've grown to love all types of fish and breaded mahi mahi has to be one of my top 5 favorites.  The tartar sauce really pulls the taste together and brings a very light element to the overall dish.    Man, I'm so glad I chose this meal.  Now I know what I'm getting from now on and will definitely be back next week.  Gosh, I hope you have the opportunity to try it!  So delicious :)",

    "text": "Not going to pretend I'm from Hawaii or anything and say that this place is authentic. However, after visiting Hawaii and eating plenty of the local food, I can say that it comes somewhat close.   I love me some hamburger steak so that's what I ordered. There wasn't enough gravy but the taste, rice and mac salad made up for that. I enjoyed it very much.   My family and I shared the large saimin noodle. The soup wasn't very tasty (I think I'm just used to ramen broth) but everything in it was good. It just wasn't like \"OMG THIS IS DELICIOUS.\"  We also had some korean chicken, which was pretty good. I would have preferred it to be crispy all over just not on one side though :p   Overall, it was a great meal and the portions are a good size. I think it's a tad pricy, but it IS in a casino (California Hotel and Casino). The line is long, so expect to wait. Also, seating is limited. I would come back if I had some extra time during my next Vegas trip and was seeking some comfort food.",

    "text": "The BF and I take his mom and grandma for lunch.   The BF got teriyaki ribeye- the meat was thin sliced and pretty soft. It's thick style teriyaki sauce which I'm not sure if I'm fond of, but its True Hawaiian style.   I got the garlic chicken with gravy- this was decent, but it was stingy with the gravy and my 3rd piece was a bit burnt on the bottom....burnt garlic flavor is no bueno. I was debating between this or the ocha zuke bento. The family all ordered a plate, but we shared so I picked the more \"family friendly\" dish since the inlaws dont like fish.    BF and I shared a ahi poke- It was okay. The cut of the fish isn't very uniform with small pieces being really marinated and some pieces being 4x it's size. They give you a good amount for the $4.95, but it's better to go to a poke deli if what you're wanting is good poke and thinking of coming here for it.  Mom got korean chicken- the BF and I loved this dish at Ross J's and hearing the two are associated by owners, we thought this would be a way to let her try it. It was good, but not nearly as good as Ross J's. They make the skin there crispy a bit so it's not nearly as fatty feeling with the skin.   Grandma got chopped beef steak- this was pretty good stir fry with beef, bean sprouts, bell peppers, onions. She enjoyed it, but she took a piece of the korean chicken and liked it better.   Each plate was about $8 so 4 plates, poke, and 4 drinks came up to $45ish so it was okay pricing, but I've had cheaper for better.   Now, parking at the California is a plain fucking bitch. There's always a lack of space for the amount of people going here. We had to find parking elsewhere and wheelchair his grandma over on the street. They are pretty good about taking orders at a good pace so if you see a long line, it'll probably be about 10-15 minutes.   Being a place with a line, a positive rating and a place associated to Ross J's (which we do really like), I was expecting a lot of ono. Not that it's a no-no, but it's just good food, not great food. It's not what I would say is worth the trouble and the wait . In the time it took us to find parking we could've gone to Henderson and took the family on a lil mini trip. Next time, we're gonna make the drive to Ross J's for the craving and skip this place.   The Aloha I was looking for isn't this.",

It could be because most of the customers come from Hawaii so they want to make it as authentic as possible.  First off, when you go here, order the Korean Chicken.  It's a bit spicy but if you like the heat like I do then \"you will love this.\". The more people the merrier...so you can try some of your friends dishes as well, like their Local Plate that comes with Spam Musubi.  What is Spam Musubi?  Well, it's spam sushi-style.  It's CASH ONLY here so bring some greenbacks with you.  It's located inside the California Hotel & Casino.  Parking is free for 4 hours after validation near the cashier cage.  Aloha Specialties is a great place to try out some Hawaiian cuisine if you've never had it before.  Enjoy!!!",

The specials are always good, Local plate, Mix plate, Teri plate. Almost everything they have is good or what Ive tried so far, even their musubi's are good, top with fruit punch and whoooaaa....Overall good place to grind but may be busy since this is a favorite to many people....",

I ordered the chicken plate the first time and was just blown away at the taste.  I mean, i looked at the plate and could probably count up the ingredients for all the items on my plate in 2 hands.  super simple, super good.  the chicken was skin-on, thigh meat.  3 big pieces on a bed of fresh sticky rice and a big scoop of mac salad.  good to the last scrape of the plate...   2nd time around this trip, i had the ribeye plate.  2 thin cut slices, on the bed of rice and mac salad.  My brother got the local plate, which should be renamed to the LOVE plate, cuz it had love all over it.  it was Chicken and  Beef teri, and 1 spam musubi + rice & mac salad.    great grub at normal prices (not vegas prices), but the only downer part is that this place is downtown and not on the strip (~$20 cab ride each way).. i was tripping, so im still giving this place full blast Yelp kudos.  5 bangers",
