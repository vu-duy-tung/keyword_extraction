I have been to TDB in the past but this was my first time at this location. The food was equally great, upkeep of the premises, and prices.   My server was not as attentive as I am used to so that's why there's a missing star.   Anyways, if you're even thinking of a churrascaria, look no further! This TDB will not disappoint!!",

Amazing side dishes that you can choose from, Brazilian cheese bread that's so addicting! And the best part men coming around to your tables with all types of meat on what are large skewers (looks kinda like a sword) that they slice for you at your table!!! My favorites are the lamb chops and they're specialty top sirloin!!! AHHHMAZING!!!!!   Our server Amanda Newman was wonderful!!! She was so accommodating and friendly to both my friend and I... I give her 10 stars for her EXCELLENT customer service!!! We spoke highly of her to her manager. I always enjoy coming here... Next time we're gonna ask to sit in her section... From the hostesses to our server, and the men serving the meat, I must say that I really enjoyed our dinner tonight!!! I know it says that this was my first time checking in here but I've been here dozens of times... Always a great place to go!!!!",

I also was very impressed at how clean and organized it was kept throughout the evening. Our servers name was Fernando and he was fantastic! He stayed on top of our drink refills and always made sure the clutter from the table was removed.  The meat carvers were all so friendly and came around very quickly. The meats ranged from top sirloin, flank steak, chicken, lamb chops and legs, bacon wrapped filet minion and some other varieties.  It was my moms birthday and they gave her a complimentary dessert, they offered creme brulee, carrot cake, chocolate cake, cheesecake, and key lime pie. We opted for the cheesecake for her, they wrote happy birthday on her plate in chocolate and raspberry syrup.  All in all the dinner was wonderful, I would highly recommend Texas de Brazil.",

    "text": "This is my second time coming to this restaurant and all I can say is that it's amazing. The minute you walk in you can you can tell the ambiance is quite classy and intimate. We walked in right when it opened and we're seated right away, however, it got pretty crowded by the hour so I would recommend to make a reservation.   This Brazilian steakhouse is basically an all you can eat steakhouse so definitely come on an empty stomach! They have servers walking around with a variety of meat and all you have to do is flip your card either green or red side up for the servers; green for go, red for stop. Once the server is at your table, you'll have your meat sliced right in front of you. In addition to this delicious meal, they have a salad bar to balance out the meat. They have variety of food like soup, salad, bread, and vegetables.   Another reason why I gave 5/5 stars is for their service. Our server gave an brief description of what we were about to get into and from time to time he would constantly ask if there is anything we need. Another pointer is that all of the servers would fold your napkin back into its original position so it's all nice and tidy when you come back to your table.   Last but not least, all of their soft drinks, coffee, and desserts are included in your meal. Desserts are limited 1 per person but they have a wide range to choose from, from a slice of cake to a cup of creme brulee. Nothing could have ended a filling meal other than a sweet dessert.",

    "text": "This is, hands down, my FAVORITE place to eat in Vegas.  I used to eat here at least twice a month. It's ALWAYS busy every time I go. However, week nights are not as busy compared to weekends. Make sure you call to reserve a table ahead of time! Or you can go online to make reservations.  In the salad bar, my favorites are the cucumber/onion salad and the au gratin potatoes. Tip: don't fill up on the salad bar if you plan on trying/eating a lot of the meats!  The servers bring each table a basket of cheese bread, mashed potatoes, and caramelized bananas. The cheese bread is good. So good, in fact, that my boyfriend wanted to go here JUST to fill up on the cheese bread. The potatoes were good as well, but it doesn't beat the au gratin potatoes that are offered at the salad bar. And the bananas are to be eaten in between meats because it's said to clear the taste pallet, so you're not mixing the tastes of the meats. But I just eat them up because they're really tasty.  There are a variety of meats (beef, lamb, pork, chicken, sausage, etc) and it's easy to get overwhelmed when you get offered half a dozen meats in a matter of minutes. My favorite will always be the house special: the picahna. It has some fat around the edges, which is my favorite part because it's PACKED with flavor. I always ask if they can cut multiple slices for me.  If you actually have room for dessert, I recommend the creme brulee. It's easily the BEST creme brulee I've ever had in my life.  My favorite part about Texas de Brazil is that the servers come around the tables and ask if there's a specific meat request you have. Within a few minutes, you'll have someone with that meat right at your table.   It is about $50 a person, but it is definitely worth every penny for the amount you eat, all the delicious flavors you experience, and the amazing service you receive.",

Just realized I've only gone there for birthday celebrations, but the food and service has always been excellent! Our server was Ashleigh. She was awesome from start to finish. She checked in on us frequently and reminded us of others things throughout our meal with being bothersome. The gauchos were all equally friendly and attentive as well. Whenever we needed a breather, just turn your card over so they don't come with more meat. Pace yourselves.   All the meat choices were seasoned well, very tasty and fresh and hot out of the kitchen.  My brother was treated to a complimentary dessert. He chose the chocolate decadence cake (which is the bomb) and my husband had cream brulee, also yummy.  Note: Please make a reservation online. It's fast and easy! Nothing's worse than going to a restaurant and waiting an hour or more for a table to open up.  Also, Monday was Texas de Brazil's 20th anniversary! Cheers!  Well, I'm returning to Vegas in about 4 weeks. You'll know where to find me! Happy eating!",

    "text": "This is definitely one of my new favorite spots! I had never been to a Brazilian steakhouse before, so I was excited at the chance to check this place out. We got there before they opened, but they still let us come inside and wait in the A/C until they were ready to go. There were a lot of people waiting to be seated, but we still got to our table quickly and our servers were very patient and friendly as we waited for the rest of our group to get there. One of them offered us some recommendations on the drink menu, and educated us about some of the food items we would be offered as well. Once everyone arrived, we walked over to the salad bar which had a ton of great options! There were many different vegetables, soups, salads, and other sides. Among the options, some of the things I chose were lobster bisque, asparagus, mushroom salad, roasted peppers, shrimp, smoked salmon, quinoa and squash. I got very small samples of the sides, knowing that there was still a lot of food to come. After we sat back down at the table, we were told to flip our cards over to green whenever we were ready for the different meats. Once you do that, there is a parade of large skewers being brought around by various servers that have some of the best steak, chicken, and pork that you'll ever find in one place! I had bacon wrapped filet, top sirloin, tenderloin, and garlic steak. Every single one was so flavorful and tender. What I also love, is that they bring different steak temperatures around and ask you if you'd like that, or let you know that they'll be bringing around one that is your preferred temperature soon. If they only have something in medium rare, for example, you can also request that it be cooked longer. There were some of the meats that we really enjoyed at our table, and when we asked for extra slices or larger portions, our server did not hold back! He was very generous and happy to come back frequently to bring anything we needed. We got so much food, and it was definitely worth the price! I will be back here for sure.",

The hostess said to wait 10 mins as they are cleaning up. So we had to wait and 10 mins had past and followed up again, then she blatantly said to wait another 10 mins without even apologizing for the wait. I do get that they are extremely busy and thats why we had reservations. It's bot unlike other places of they foresee you are to wait they will at least inform you of the hang up. Last follow up we mad its already 20 mins past our reservation and this time, it's the manager who is standing in the reception, just said\" table is getting ready\" for a manager to be like that and seems he don't care. We are first timers with the hopes of coming back so we have options other than Fogo but with this experience, i don't think we are and definitely not recommending this loud and noisy place for a nice dinner...  Food as okay, I gave 1 star for plenty of choices for hot dishes and salad but thats about it!!!",

We ordered a desert and she made sure It showed \"Happy Anniversary\" on the plate. I'm pretty sure they do it for everyone but still finding out what we were there for is amazing. Little things do matter and it's what make memories. And it also makes us come back every time.",

The food was very well perhaps there should be a separate card for guest who do not eat pork. Just a recommendation, I love pork! lol The lights were kind of dim which made the experience more intimate than most Brazilian Steakhouse. We did not have dessert but the plastic immitations looked really appetizing to me. I thought it was real My girlfriend and her date did have two lattes. That were enjoyable as well.

Although the girl who seated us was lacking personality. Our server on the other hand was amazing! He made sure everything came to our table so my guests could sample everything I raved about! Their favorite was the garlic sirloin! I agree that's my favorite too! Definitely suggest making reservation because I heard them quoting 1 hour wait for no reservation. I'm glad I made mine! Will definitely come back again again again!   I came in today for lunch 1/4/17. All you can eat for $32.99! I came in with a party of 3,immediately we were greeted by the sweetest hostess! She gave us an awesome piece of advice to not go over board at the salad area and save room for the meats! She was right! Although, they have an amazing salad bar with everything you can imagine, the meats are the star of the show! Our server was extremely attentive to our needs, she made sure we really enjoyed our experience. We were on or lunch break so we didn't stay for long but I'll definitely be back for dinner! Amazing staff, amazing food!",

It was exquisite with fresh and premium choices of hoer derves, charcuterie, salad, and lobster bisque. They give you cheese balls, there version of plantain bananas to clear your pallet when trying new meats, and mash potatoes on your table.   I always eat light on the buffet because I pay for the meats. I thought their cuts of meat where marinated splendidly. I saw and ate at least a dozen cuts of meat, and I am sure there were more. My favorite was beef ribs, the most moist cut there and it melts in your mouth like butter. You can request for meats and they will bring it to your table. The meats will keep on coming as long as your tab on your table is green.   Overall eating here is fantastic experience from the service to the food and to the environment it is worth price. Lastly, the customer service here is amazing so make sure you tip your servers well. I would definitely recommend this place to anyone who is looking for a great Brazilian grill experience.",

For those of you who don't know, you usually start off with getting a plate from the salad bar and selecting various side dishes, which are usually pretty good and vary sometimes. The only thing I do not enjoy from this place is their shrimp, and it's bad enough to take a star away. For whatever reason, their shrimp always make me feel queasy and then afterwards I have an aversion to shrimp for a few months. Not sure what's up with that as I love shrimp. The rest of the stuff in the salad/side dish bar are pretty good. Just don't fill up on this part, because the meats are what you're really paying the big bucks for.....  Once you return to your table, you'll be approached by waiters carrying around big skewers of different sorts of meats, which you personally will select, or pass up. There is no shortage of delicious meats, trust me! The meats are almost all delicious, and their desserts are divine. It's overall a fun and unique dining experience. The wait staff is always professional and attentive, despite how packed this place usually is. Fix the shrimp, and I'll give them five stars. :) Hubby and I like to get gift cards to this place for date night because it's fun and fantastic.",

You can't use their white gift cards on discounts such as this, which really sucks. They claim because the white cards are already discounted. I got my card from work, so I wasn't aware it was a discounted card.  The food was plentiful. The salad bar was consistently re-stocked and clean. Many of the meats weren't warm. I suppose it was because it's was super busy and we were seated pretty far away. We had three people helping us, and it wasn't clear who the waiter was till we were halfway done eating. I ordered a coke right when we sat down, but it never came and I had to order again. This particular visit it was also annoying that the meat guys stopped even when the red side was up on our marker. I mean what's the point of that if they ignore it. All in all, our waiter, when we finally knew who he was, was good. But he was really busy and it showed.",

My card stays green until I tap out because although I love the options, I am particular to the ones I eat. I especially love, LOVE, love the special house sirloin.   On the regular, I am not a sirloin kindza girl... but here, omg!! It's a must!! The charred trim of fat is just a burst of flavors to accompany the tender meat party in my mouth. My second favorite meat is I believe the flank steak. It is so tender and juicy. I rarely try the other meats TBH lol. As far as the salad bar, I usually fux with everything there, but at Texas De Brazil, it's hard for me to eat too much of it because then I'll get full too fast lol. I do love the mushrooms to accompany my steaks, grilled pineapples, and lobster bisque.   We also enjoy the plantains and cheese rolls that come out. The mashed potatoes are good too. Service has been nothing but great thus far. Wine options are very broad. There's definitely something to pair with all the meats served here. I usually go for a CabSauv to satiate my palate when I am eating the meats here.   You bet we are coming back for more!!",

    "text": "Texas de Brazil found their way to my stomach and therefore have found their way into my heart. I don't know why we didn't try this place sooner!  First of all, this Texas de Brazil is in a prime location: inside Town Square and minutes from the airport as well as the Strip. After a long day of shopping and/or taking in the sights, this would be a perfect option for dinner.   The process is simple. You're given a small double sided card. Green means go and red means stop. There are many different servers throughout the restaurant that will bring you many different varieties of meat. There's an unlimited salad bar so you can have sides with your meat. You're also given a side of mashed potatoes. They also give you a side of plantains that serves as a palate cleanser in between meats, but they are also a perfect sweet snack to have after your meal.  The service was wonderful and the atmosphere was exciting. The food was delicious and the meats were all cooked to perfection. It's clear that these guys are pros in their game. The only downside is the hefty price tag, but it's worth every penny in my opinion.   If you love meat or are looking for a unique take on a steak house, please do me a favor and try this place out. I will be back and I will be finding any reason to make up a special occasion to come here.",

    "text": "I have been visiting here for over 5+ years now and every visit has consistently been a treat.  Here's my summary of all those great visits throughout the years. My last visit was on a Thursday night with a 7:45 reservation dinner for 3.  Service: Amazing how consistent the service has been considering it's always packed at just about every visit. They get you started quickly with the bread, garlic mashed potatoes and fried sweet bananas within 7 minutes of sitting down.  Waters are filled, drink orders are taken and you're off.  You don't have to worry about  Food: Consistently on point!  Salad Bar: The creamy lobster bisque, doesn't actually have lobster in it.  BUT I love it, I start each visit with the bisque and end it with the bisque when I'm full af. Yes, that's weird.  Slabs of goat cheese, jalapenos and asparagus tips is what I throw down with the meats.  It amazes me how everything here is always high quality and fresh.  Meats: The presentation of the waiters bringing around the slabs of meat is always fun to me, like Disneyland.  Some meats have better days than others, but these are my favs. Filet Mignon - Medium rare is the only way I roll. House Sirloin - Usually get this 3 times if they have it. Lamb Chops - Lamb can be messed up quickly if not prepared right, always good here. Pork Ribs - Always juicy, with too much fat sometimes.  Which I actually like, ugh. lol Flank Steak - Seems to always be the first meat on the plate? I don't mind Parmesan Crusted Pork Loin - If not careful, this can come out dry. But so good when it's not!  Value: $49.99 (dinner) for AYCE meat brings me pretty good value imo.  Coupled with the amazing salad bar, totally gets us home.  Ambiance: High quality utensils and plates are utilized as you're cutting meat all day.  Tables, are packed tight but not to hinder travel throughout the restaurant.  It's going to be noisy because it's always packed but still a great place for a date to have conversation.  Classy atmosphere that puts you in a good mood to eat massively =)  Summary: I usually save this place to bring visiting guests who don't have a texas de brazil or haven't experienced this type of dining.  At the same time, it's great place to just get down when you're looking to get your alpha carnivore on.",

Plates are empty as the servers just walk by....This is usually a wonderful experience here. Not today. All the meat was bloody red and almost raw... it was not good; then you ask for meat to be medium or medium well and then u sit some more.  We actually said something to the mgr; it's supposed to be a dining experience.... they are supposed to make it an unforgettable experience. It's unfortunately unforgettable, but in a bad way. We will not be going back for a long while, it's a lot of money to waste on a shitty experience.",

    "text": "After being recommended by my friends, we decided to go to Texas de Brazil to see if it lives up to its reputation.  They are located in Town Square on the sunset road side in its own building.  We got there about 8:30 pm and the restaurant was kinda packed but they found seating in no time.  For about $50 dollars per person you get all you can eat meats served to your table and a salad bar.  The concept sounds better than it actually is.  In the 1-1/2 hours we were there, we were unable to sample all meats because the servers did not come to our table despite the disk being green side up (green side up means you want the servers to come).  When we asked the waiter about sampling all the meats he seemed to think we were being unreasonable saying just to pick one or two meats.  The meats that did come to our table were mostly repeats as there were 5 different guys serving the sirloin (the cheap cut).  The more popular meats such as braised beef ribs and barbecued pork ribs needed to be ordered through the waiter.  Most of the meats were overcooked, dry and some burnt.  When the meat gets cold they take it back to the kitchen to be reheated.  You can tell because some of the meats that came to our table had flat cut marks all over the meat and the outer edge was seared.  Finally, with all the people coughing from the dry/cold weather, I really didn't like how they would walk around the restaurant with the meats.  It just seemed unsanitary.  That said, the braised beef ribs were good although being overcooked and the salad bar was decent.",

Everything else was ok but not notable.  Salad bar was weak as well but we were there for the meats so it was not as much of let down.  Would try again.",

I definitely recommend calling for an RSVP in advance! The food was amazing! Their meats are all cooked at a rare to medium scale, but if that isn't your preference, you can request any of their meat selections up to well done. All their rare meats were very tender and full of flavor so I also recommend trying them rare! The salad bar had a great selection of sides as well as soups. Our server was very friendly and easy to talk to and explained how the Brazilian Steakhouse red/green cards work with ease. I decided to return again a couple weeks later to treat my dad for his birthday and he had a great time (and wants me to take him again lol)! I would absolutely come back again!

We walked in and asked about the menu and if there were a la carte options or plain all you can eat/salad bar. The lady was rude and kept reiterating it was all you can eat and I was like I get it, but are there a la carte options in case an individual wasn't in the mood to stuff his or her face?! It ticked me off the nerve she had.   We resorted to the bar area, which is cute and dainty with lounge tables that can seat 2-4 people or the bar top of course.   We only had a few drinks, in which the gentleman (I wish we got his name) recommended and what their known for. I couldn't believe how fresh and delicious they were!   We didn't eat here, it was already 9pm and we decided not to be left with the leftovers of the evening and left on our way. But we had a great time chatting with him and enjoyed amazingly refreshing drinks. Cheers!",

If you haven't had Brazilian steakhouses before, this is an all you can eat type. You have a paper circle...green for bring me the meat! Red for please stop, I have the meat sweats.   The salad bar had a lot of options so it's hard to not stack up on that. You want to try everything but you also want to save room for all the meats.   They also bring you fried bananas, mashed potatoes, and cheese rolls. Fried bananas were amazing!!! Not like what we have had before. It's not rolled in dough, more so covered in sugar. We got multiple dishes of it. Lobster bisque from the salad bar was a standout as well. Not too heavy on the seafood smell and very buttery.   LOTS OF MEAT! The second you turned that circle green, it was a bit overwhelming with how fast they come at you and ask you if you want certain cuts. If they didn't bring something you wanted or you missed them, you can always requests for the cut. Standouts for meat would be the sausage and the filet. All of the meat was well marinated and incredibly tender.   Great place! Be prepared to eat a lot. We would be back for special occasions but not an every month type of place for us.",

There's a wide variety of wines, spirits, cocktails, liquors, etc. (the house wine is very good). Don't fill up with salad here, enjoy the meat! And also enjoy the caramelized bananas they give you at the end, they are so yumi! We always walk-in but roll-out :)",

Although it's cheaper here and they're open for lunch everyday and they have goat cheese at the salad bar, the service and food quality is marginal.   They have the usual Brazilian BBQ salad bar items such as smoked salmon, lettuce, tomatoes, mushrooms, asparagus, cheeses, olives, salami, beans and rice etc. They give you pao de queijo, fried bananas and mashed potatoes. The meats include chicken, beef, pork, sausage and lamb. I've tried their Key Lime pie, cheesecake, flan and chocolate mousse all of which were just ok.  The gaucho guys seem to take longer going around and when I come to a churrascaria, I come famished...waiting cannot happen. They seem careless too. I'd have blood/ oil/ meat juice drip next to my plate or my arm! Obrigadinha!  Out of the churrascaria's in Vegas. FdC on Flamingo is #1 on my list, TdB is #2, VB in Summerlin is #3...and that P place in Planet Hollywood? Forget it!",

Service was impeccable, and from the minute we sat down, meat was coming at us. All of it was a perfect medium rate, all of it perfectly seasoned. I love at these types of places how the servers learn to know what you like and what you don't, so that's what they bring around for you.   We didn't try the salad bar because, well, why would we? . I'm there for MEAT!!!!  We did, however, leave room for dessert. We selected a beautiful citrus vanilla Creme brulee. Oh my...it was heaven. Definitely will visit again. We will at least try the one that's about 1 1/2 hours from our home.   Excellent. Come hungry and enjoy!",

TDB is a carnivore's paradise, from filet mignon to flank steak to lamb chops and leg of lamb the list goes on and on but I have to say the top sirloin steak is my favorite. The salad bar and sides alone are worth coming for but of course the meats are the stars of the show. There's nothing much to add to what's already been uttered again and again about this place being good, it's one of those places you just have to try for yourself at least once.   For me personally, I never get my moneys worth at AYCE places so for next time, Friday lunch (they're only open Fri-Sun for lunch) at about $33 would probably be my best bet. According to our server Adam (who by the way was awesome!!!) There's only a few item difference in the salad bar area between lunch and dinner, but as far as the meat goes it's the same line up. Food, ambiance and service was all on point which makes it a 5 star experience.",

My friend had a VIP card so unfortunately she didn't qualify for the freebies since she would be getting a discount with her card. The salad bar is packed with tasty sides to go with your meal. My favorites are the grilled pineapple , shrimp, quinoa, potato salad, tabbouleh, lobster bisque, and marinated mushrooms. I'll usually pair the pineapple with the shrimp so I can get the sweet and savory taste. They also place these fresh tiny pieces of bread that taste like cheez its on the table. If you have never been to a Brazilian barbecue it is equal to a meat bonanza! (All you can eat) There are little place cards on the table when you want meat brought to the table flip the green side up when you have to much to handle flip it back to red. They come around with chicken wrapped in bacon, sausage, filet mignon, garlic flavored steak, flank steak etc. I was so full I didn't care if we missed out on the free dessert! It's a great place to go if you want a new dining experience and are tired of paying $25.00 for itty bitty pieces of steak!",

    "text": "CARNIVORE HEAVEN! Now before you get that opening wrong, let me be clear...I had one of the most romantic evenings of my adult life at this place.  The restaurant is nicely dim lit. Everyone is very well dressed if you come in the evening and the person that greeted us was immediately there to take care of us and get us seated.  To make sure we weren't going to have to wait I of course booked a table in advance ;-)!  So now let me continue by talking about what you really want to hear, \"the food\".  \"Hypnotizingly Delicious\" if you could put that into those words.  Any and all meats are brought fresh and hot individually systematically to your table, \"IF\" you flip your card up indicating the color green for \"more meat\"; red means no more or, not now.  The salad bar as well was very fresh with great assortments to choose from.  And as if that wasn't enough, if you somehow managed to find a spot available inside your body cavity to consider desert, out comes the waiter with an assortment of deserts that will make you shed a tear.  The choices were so difficult we each chose two and took them home because we absolutely had no room to eat at that moment hahaha.  When shared one each later that evening they were exactly what expected from the beginning to the end of a magical and magnificent evening at Texas de Brazil.  One small note:  Gentlemen, if your significant other does not like spending money, do not let your partner see the bill as this place is a strong bit on the pricey end.  However, for an anniversary event or a rare, special occasion, I have to say it was worth every penny.  Not something I would do every month, but definitely once a year regardless of what my bank account holds.  Hope anyone that reads this finds this helpful.  My wife absolutely loved the food and atmosphere!!",

It's worth every cent for the beef and Portuguese sausage.  I would give 5 stars if it was focused just on those things.  Every thing else... I wasn't impressed with. Highly recommended for fans of Brazilian BBQ!",

We found it way too pricey for a Sunday lunch and also our waiter was not very well informed (e.g., he did not mention the senior discount, which would have clearly applied to my parents-in-law. We found out later on their website when it was too late). It was a great experience but due to the high price I will not go back (i.e., there is better value for money out there)",

    "text": "I love me some good brazilian bbq.  This place is pretty comparable to Fogo De Chao, and a smidge cheaper.    The service is great.  Once we got our plates from the buffet portion, we pretty much got 4-5 types of meats on our plates within 5 minutes.  The waitress said they had kinds of meat, but I don't think we got that many.  I find that the quality of meat is not as good as Fogo, but it was still pretty good.  The filet mignon was super tender.  Their buffet section had a lot of options.   The lobster bisque was pretty good as was the smoked salmon.    This place is definitely worth trying out if you want something that's not a typical vegas buffet.  On a side note, the soda is not free refills.  You just get a small bottle.",

We were then explained by our sever how everything worked and asked if we had any questions or requests to not hesitate on asking. We started with the salad bar where they offered wide variety of salads, cheeses, sushi rolls and salmon. After we finished with what we picked out from the salad bar we tried many of the different meats they offered and my favorite was the prime rib. We finished our meal with a flan my mothers favorite dessert. Overall the staff was friendly and the atmosphere is very clean and upscale I would recommend for any special occasion.",

My friend and I along with her 2 children came on a Wednesday night. It was not super busy since it's the middle of the week. Waiting for about 15 mins to be seated. Then we go to the salad bar and begin with our journey.   The different meats were coming around but I know exactly what I want. I'm not going to waste my time eating chicken when I can wait for the filet. Just the regular one not the bacon covered ... they ask me what am I waiting for and I tell them. They say why don't you try this instead, I nod my head and continue to wait. Mind you my salad bar was great and consistent to all the other times I have been here. My meat takes about 40 minutes to come out and he only brings burnt ones... moving along, my friend and her kids normally love  love lamb chops so they ask for 2 each. The guy looks irritated with them but gives them 2 each. They are super excited to eat it and it tasted just nasty. It tasted like lemon vinegar. Then we tried the bacon wrapped chicken since what we came for was so horrible! Guess what? Totally DRY! I couldn't believe it!! I've never came here and had the food taste this bad!! And to top it off, we had to ask for more water. The server didn't come check on us, we had to wave down another server to get water refills. The good was horrible and I dont think I will return to this location.   After paying the bill, as we were walking out, I asked to speak to a manager and the manager said I am sorry to hear this. Next time let me know earlier and we can do something about it. I was thinking to myself, there will not be a next time for us. Oh well ... 2 stars for salad bar!",

The upfront information and selection at the soup and salad bar were excellent. Our requests for service were taken care of promptly. The food was plentiful. The STOP and GO signals are not really observed by most of the servers, this was good and bad. We ate A LOT and some came when we were not expecting it but it simply sounded too good to pass up on.  Like most of Las Vegas it was expensive compared to many other Brazilian restaurants we have been to.   Overall, thanks for a good time and great food.",

My love affair with TdB has evolved as I have eaten bacon-wrapped chicken and filet mignon to my heart's content at their Orlando, Puerto Rico, and Las Vegas locations. I have casually entertained other Brazilian steakhouse restaurants, but I still have a special place in my stomach for my first. Even though it has been years since I had one of their savory, fire-roasted morsels dance across my palate, I was not disappointed. Their flavor reigns supreme and the service is impeccable.

    "text": "Disappointing... a local friend recommended this place to us and said it was absolutely the best so we went in there with very high expectations. In fact, they went there the night before and came back and was raving about how delicious it was; meat so tender that it melted in your mouth.   The service was great and their salad spread was awesome but the meat is supposed to be the star and it didn't shine!  Herb-marinated pork lion - never saw it come around Picanha - salty, I like mine more on the rare side but got medium, even after I asked for rare, I just figured they didn't have it Sausage - juicy, not too bad Leg of lamb, one of the main items I came here for. I asked the waiter for it, he said he'll bring it out but never did.  Chicken breast wrapped in bacon - dry Alcatra - not really sure what this is, probably didn't come around Lamb chops - typically my favorite, you would think a place like this will do it justice but he gave me two pieces, I ate one and didn't even want to eat the other one. Normally, I can eat 4-6 of these puppies! But the one I had was salty and dry. Everything was salty and dry.  Filet mignon wrapped in bacon - salty, overcooked, dry Parmesan-crusted pork loin - never saw it come around Garlic picanha - nope Braised beef ribs - nada BBQ pork ribs - mo'ah (no in Chinese) Filet Mignon - Khong (no in Vietnamese) Parmesan drumlettes - I didn't try, it looked dried. Flank steak - I finally got a piece that was closer to the rare - medium rare side, and was able to enjoy it Cheesy bread - was flat and had a bitter after taste.  We order their special flavored lemonade; mango and passion fruit. If you love tart, than thumbs up for you. My boyfriend drinks lemonade all the time and it was too tarty for him.   If it was not for the chimichurri sauce, I probably would not have finished the meat on my plate. Needless to say, I wasn't impressed. Maybe I went with too high of an expectation.",

The lobster bisque was amazing but don't fill up too quickly on it! I personally love the house special top sirloin. The server Adam S. Did a fantastic job; although they may seem to be on a script, the wittiness of the server created a comfortable and fun experience.   I highly suggested grabbing some spring mix to balance the meat selection. I also had the guarana soda for the first time here at the restaurant and it was wonderful.   While the price is on the higher side, about $70 per person after tip, I suggest making it the experience by eating up!   I would suggest the place but I'd keep it for special occasions.",

At $52.00 per person, drinks or desert NOT INCLUDED, you better have an outstanding variety of meats and flavors.    The salad bar was very tasty and our meats were:  Picanha Sirloin Picanha Lamb Lamb Chop Garlic Sirloin Filet Mignon Bacon Wrapped Filet Mignon Beef Rib Parmesan Chicken Sausage Flank Steak and two pork dishes.  While that's plenty of meat, it began to all taste the same after a while.    For $52.00 in Las Vegas you can go to some of the better buffets and get an all included meal or save some money and go to M Buffet where your beer, wine and desserts are all included for half the price.  I am sure this review will draw some controversy, Texas de Brazil may be a great place in other parts of the country, but in Las Vegas, I felt like we made an unwise choice.",

I came in here on a Sunday night at around 4, and it wasn't busy at that time. Once it started hitting at 5 pm it began to be super busy. Our waiter \"Richard\" was very nice and helpful. I appreciated his enthusiasm working for this company.   This awesome meat factory is located on the outskirts of Town square. Plenty of parking, and the building is huge to not miss it. The inside can get a little crowded around the salad bar. I believe the salad bar you can just pay to eat there which i don't mind. So you have so many waiters walking around with meat either they serve you or skip you depending on your card.   Now for the food, my favorite part of the salad bar was the mint sauce for my steak and all the vegetables they offer. I keep going back for more ! I only eat mostly all the beef steak options. The flank steak was my favorite and ribeye steak. I give everything a 5/5 rating !!! The price is worth it, than eating at those fancy buffets at the strip. Im definitely coming back, no matter what the occasion is.",

Suggestion: Go for lunch, it's basically the same menu(except for a couple more dishes, desert & drinks included with dinner). It's basically a buffet, but instead of the meat sitting out(getting dry), they bring it to you fresh & hot!. They have waiters walking around with fresh cooked meats on a skewer & if you want some they slice a piece for you(steak, chicken, lamb, sausage, etc). They also have a salad bar(with a few desert items) which is very good too(included with the price). I highly recommend this place for first timers, birthday parties, graduation parties, basically any special occasion.",

Oh especially the flank steak, cooked a perfect medium rare and beef piccana! The sides range from romaine salad to mozzarella cheese balls to the best potato salad I've had in any restaurant. Definitely down for the garlic mashed too! We went for lunch and it was the best experience because our waitress Angel was the best! She made everything fun and she was delightful! She made us aware of the menu with the different meats and also the sides with deserts, which are included in the price. And also she told us about her favorite which was the lamb chop and that is why I tried it and also the Brazilian cheesecake which is yums!! So definitely we'll be back and look forward to our next visit! Very friendly staff! (Oh and I wish I would've tried the lobster bisque)",

When he finally came around, he messed the check up by charging us for the full buffets, when 1 person in our party only had the salad bar (explained when we first walked in). Also took 20 mins to finally get the guy with the hot links to come around. This was after asking everyone if they could send him by. I dont think I'd go back to this place again. On top of everything, the server had a minimum requirement of 18% tip as the lowest amount available. Excuse me but if the service is a fail and my party of 4 wasnt satisfied, I dont appreciate being told I need to give pay the guy a certain tip for the lack of work ethic. Never again",

Service was wonderful from our server Miguel to the constant Meat carvers that come to your table offering you the vast variety of their meat selection. Absolutely recommend you coming here for a special occasion of any sort, it's $50+ a person but the quality of meat selection they offer is worth it. Especially that's there's no limit on the food, you can literally eat till you drop. I highly recommend you come with an appetite, like have a small breakfast and maybe some edibles and you'll do just fine haha   Their salad bar full of sides, soups, salads and toppings is amazing. 50+ items you have the option of having. We even had a pescatarian that came with us to celebrate and she was more than satisfied with their selection at the self serve bar that had items from their lobster bisque, sushi, salads and different side items.   Dessert was delicious. We tried the Brazilian cheesecake, creme brulee, chocolate cake and the Banana fosters. All the perfect cherry on top of our meal but our favorites were the chocolate cake and banana fosters.   The overall experience we had of a group of 12 people was amazing. Definitely will be back.",

This location is frequented by visitors to LV and not locals.  The price is much higher than it should be and it was even more disappointing when the meats we really wanted were never offered.  Filet and chicken breast with bacon, lamb chops and pork loin.  They just never came around during the whole visit.  The pork ribs were dry and chewy.   Service was strange.  The meat servers seemed almost robotic, not very friendly and quick to drop off and run.  Salad bar was okay, less offerings than last visit.  Lobster bisque was tasty, but not hot.  Maybe some other type of fish could be offered other than a odd looking fish stew that did not look appetizing.    Sorry, will not be back and will not recommend.",

I've been to Vegas quite a few times and have driven by this place just as much.  Located in the Town Center area just outside of the strip, is a meat lovers paradise called Texas de Brazil. No we're not in Texas nor are we in Brazil. It is however a Brazilian steakhouse with some of the most amazing flavors and and awesome salad bar you will find anywhere else. Just remember, GREEN means GO and RED means STOP.  You will know what I'm talking about, should you be so inclined to visit. But anyways, all I can say is WOW. From the front desk, to the wait staff, to the \"meat\" runners, and the amazing ambience.  I know there are plenty of places to eat at in Vegas, but this is a must visit and gorge place. You will definitely loosen your belt and leave hunched over!!!",

    "text": "Ok we came here with a large party to celebrate my niece's 21st birthday while we were in Vegas. My sister chose this place because my niece used to work at Brazilian BBQ restaurant in Portland so I think she picked it. It is just South of the Strip in an outdoor strip mall.  When you walk in, it's definitely a site to behold. Beautiful interior, open space and clean. It's a bit of a different concept, one that I was not used to and was slightly confusing, if I'm being totally honest. You each have a little circular card that has a green side and a red side. You are supposed to put the green side up if you want people to come and offer you some kind of meat, and put the red side up if you need a break. It seemed a bit overwhelming when people kept swooping in and asking if you want Filet Mignon, or Brazilian sausage, or chicken, or whatever else they offered. They keep the meat on a vertical skewer and slice it fresh for you onto your plate. But I kept saying yes. Partly because I wanted to try everything, and partly because I knew if I passed on something, I wouldn't get another opportunity to try it. They didn't come back with that dish. I felt like I never really got to sit and enjoy or savor anything because the next option was standing there waiting for you to say yes or no.  Then they also advise you to go get a plate of what I would call \"sides.\" This was also kind of  confusing for me. I filled up more than one plate on a bunch of side dishes, which was a mistake. But I felt that it wasn't explained well beforehand so I wasn't sure what to do. They have cheeses, sauteed onions, grilled vegetables, soups, etc. Lots of stuff to pile on your plate that you're never going to actually eat.  Don't get me wrong. The food was flavorful. It was mostly all good and I enjoyed it. The prices were high. Everything. But I suppose that's normal for Vegas. To me though, I'm not sure it warranted the expense. You basically pay an AYCE fee ($50 per adult, if I recall correctly), plus drinks. And that was with a 20% discount. They were extremely reasonable with the kids though. It was so little, I don't even recall the amount. But then again, how much is your 2 year old gonna eat? In the end, it was a cool experience but I don't think I'd rush to come back. If someone else picked it again, I wouldn't balk, but I'd probably rather eat at a regular steakhouse.",

    "text": "Make sure you are hungry and you like to eat meat. The style of a Brazilian BBQ is to have servers roving around the dining floor with a variety of meats. They stop by your table and offer you some of the meat they are offering. These meats include filet mignon, filet mignon wrapped in bacon, sausage, Parmesan pork, bacon wrapped chicken, flank steak, ribs, etc. You will be given a button to put on your table that indicates whether you want the servers to stop by or not.   The meats are high quality and they also offer some side dishes in addition to full access to a large salad bar. The side dishes include mashed potatoes, cinnamon fried bananas, and Brazilian cheese bread. The salad bar has soups, salads, cheeses, vegetables, deli meats, and some other food items.   It's basically a gourmet buffet with a twist. The service is attentive and if there is any meat you are looking for in particular, you can just ask.   My only complaint would be the price, but for what you are getting and the experience, the price is actually very reasonable. It's a great place to celebrate a special occasion or dine out to.   The inside area, while large, doesn't feel like you are in a large buffet dining hall. The lighting is dim and feels intimate even though there are lots of nearby tables.   Make sure you get a reservation if you are dining with a large group, or be prepared to wait 30-45 minutes in peak times.",

We even got a call the day of to confirm our reservation. When we arrived, we gave them our name and they looked at us with a blank look and said they did not have our reservation. I showed her the call back number and the hostess really didn't seem to care. Not the best way to start my celebration. After waiting, we were given the table right behind the hostess stand, so forget atmosphere. I felt every breeze that came in when the doors opened. Our service was ok, we had to ask for refills, and sat some time waiting for the meats to come by our table. We ordered dessert, no candle to celebrate. My guess was the waiter was never told. Even though it was mentioned when making the reservation and when we arrived. Overall the food was good, but very much a lack of customer service.",

    "text": "My Brazilian friend and I had been disappointed at another Brazilian restaurant in town and weren't going to give up on our quest to get a decent Brazilian meal here. That we did at Texas de Brazil. It's a huge, beautiful, busy restaurant. You get tons of food, especially meat, barbecued meat, which is what Texas de Brazil is all about. I absolutely loved the Picanha cut of meat, which is a type of sirloin, because it was so tender and moist. Next time I go that's the only meat I will eat...no I think I'll still want to try others, but I will definitely get my fill of that. The salad bar was also excellent, and it was nice to try different Brazilian sides and veggies. But don't make the mistake that I did and fill up on that salad bar. I had little room for my Picanha (try it, you won't regret it). The service was good, and the only downside was that it's very expensive. I know it's all you can eat meat, but still it's expensive. Next time we're going during lunch. Anyway, I really loved the place, and can't wait to go back when my friend has money!",

Don't accept whatever is offered. Pace yourself. Suggest you try the Brazilian picahna, filet with bacon, lamb chops and beef spare ribs.  Meat is all buttery soft and perfectly prepared. I love the picahna and the filets were tender and juicy. Food was hot (temperature not spice) which can be a risk when theyre walking around with it like that. The parmesian encrusted pork was a little dry for me, but the beauty of this place is that you can set it aside and go for something else. The lamb chops were incredible; I normally avoid lamb (gamey in my opinion) but acquiesced after my friend insisted--glad I did.   My guest had a few drinks and I stuck to water. Total bill with generous tip $200. Worth it. Didn't eat for 24 hour after that meal. I will be back.",

Hostess and meat servers were top-notch, but our table server was less than attentive. We had to ask for clean plates after finishing our salads; drinks were not refilled in a timely manner; dirty plates were not removed;  and our server disappeared for at least 15 minutes more than once. My mother waited 10 minutes for a cup of coffee, which was eventually brought to her by another server. Very disappointing component to what could have been a memorable evening.",

The sides were offered buffet style and there are sooo many delicious cold and hot sides that you can get full on just that.  Then the parade of meat came and it was glorious.  Frenched lamb chops, house sirloin, chicken, beef ribs, pork ribs, sausages.  I was deliciously overwhelmed!  The service was exceptional.  They not only keep coming around but they even ask if you have favourited that they will bring in higher frequency.  I wish we had this place in Canada but I definitely have a food coma so I think I am good to dream of this place until I return again to Vegas!",

We weren't huge fans of the Parmesan crusted items, but everything else was top notch. The seasoning was out of this world. Fogo de Chao and Samba don't have anything on TDB when it comes to flavor or meat selection. The lamb and filet mignon were our favorites. TDB is on the list for EVERY vegas trip from now on!",

I could go on and on about each individual choice but you won't be disappointed with anything you choose! The service was amazing and prompt, our glasses stayed full and plates stayed covered.

Texas de Brazil is the best, especially for the price ($49.99, kids 6-12 $24.99), which was a bit less than the last churrascaria we tried. The meat was tender, juicy, and flavorful. By far the best meat of any churrascaria. The salad bar had excellent cheese, meats, vegetables, soups, and salads as expected. The popover-like rolls and plantains were good. The only disappointment were the mashed potatoes. Service was very good, and the servers passed as soon as we turned over our cards and asked if we wanted a specific meat. It's impressive when service is good when we opt to not order beverages.",

I've been to other Brazilian BBQ restaurants like Fogo & they all come up short in comparison to Texas. I've even been to the one in Miami beach & they have the same quality as this Las Vegas location.  Whenever I'm in town I always bring friends that have never been here, and they always love this place. It's a must try, if you plan on going for dinner during the weekend make sure you call a few days in advance for a reservation to get the time you actually want, this place gets packed on the weekends.",

It's $50 for dinner per adult and you have access to their large salad bar which includes salad, cold sides, soup, potatoes, meat and cheese, sushi, and plenty of other options for the table. The salad bar has a huge tropical floral arrangement in the center.  You start at the salad bar and then move on to the meat! You get a small circle chip with green on one side meaning you want the carvers to come to the table and red on the other meaning you do not want any more meat. There are gentlemen who walk around the restaurant with different types and cuts of meats on a spit and they cut small pieces for you. The meat is cooked medium rare but it's so flavorful!   The restaurant itself is quite large with a huge wine selection. The tables are smaller and intimate; the lighting dim. I would say typically you spend around 1-1.5 hours dining. This is a great place and I will keep coming back!",

When we arrived at the restaurant, our hostess again asked whether we were celebrating any special occasion, and again, I replied \"birthday.\" Somehow, none of these notes were communicated to our server though, and my birthday was never acknowledged, even though a neighboring table got a slice of birthday cake with a candle. I even used a birthday $25 off two dinners coupon during this meal, so I don't know how much more obvious I could have been.  My little grudge aside, the interior of this Texas de Brazil, like all Texas de Brazil locations, is quite opulent. Service is attentive and they will come by to fold your table napkin when you are up getting food.   Prices are standard, $50 for dinner for all-you-can-eat meats + salad bar.   I think the meats here are on the saltier side (some cuts more than others), so I prefer the meat at Fogo de Chao better, though I strongly prefer the salad bar at Texas de Brazil. Plus, Texas de Brazil salad bar has lobster bisque!  Overall, a great place to come when celebrating a special occasion.",

The salad dressings are spectacular.      This was our first time in.  My wife eats no meat and still Texas de Brazil's salad bar full of  delightful cheeses, shrimp salad, tabbouleh,  lobster bisque, a variety of roasted and grilled vegetables, sushi, smoked salmon and other salad items kept her happy and contented.  Additional sides, like potatoes au gratin, yucca, rice, and sauteed mushrooms are available in, yes you guessed it, an endless supply.  As you return to your table and begin to dine on your salad bar choices, you enjoy not one waiter, but many as the \"Passadors\" who are constantly walking the restaurant with giant skewers of meat brought to your table and carved table side continually ask if you would care for whatever they are carrying.  The endless supply of meats include Parmesan encrusted chicken, pork tenderloin, barbecue ribs, a spicy chicken breast, lamb chops, venison, sausages, plain or bacon wrapped filet mignon, chicken drumsticks and bacon wrapped chicken.   The passadors come often and with delicious varieties of meats, seasoned to perfection and done to whatever temperature you might desire.  The meal includes select drinks and dessert if you have any room left.  Service is fast and impeccable.  The environment is upscale and casual offering very comfortable seating.  We will return often. Texas de Brazil turned out to be a wonderful and delightful surprise and value.  We commend this restaurant to you without reservations.",

Comes with a salad bar, not a typical salad bar though which is good. Tons of veggies, cheese, olives, and even some warm sides.  Come prepared to eat because there is just so much food.   Service is ok. It's just so crowded in here that it's hard to hear and they come around so fast with the meat that you barely have time to make a decision.  Just a little tip, bring an extra plate from the salad bar and use that for your meat because when they do come around and you say yes to the meat they will just place it anywhere on your plate.",

I'd skip the mint sauce as it was a bit too sweet and fake tasting.  The salad bar was good. I loved the peppers and prosciutto.   The green pea dish was great.  I also liked the spicy peppers but careful they are very hot.  Definitely try the lobster bisque so smooth and velvety. I didn't eat anything else off the hot bar but the mashed potatoes on the table were also very smooth.  The food is 4 star but the reason for my 3 was my table. They wedged me in a table right at the front 5 feet from checkin it was like dining in the lobby and it was pretty rude.  I'm not sure I will go back if that is how they're going to treat guests that aren't the large parties they seem to cater to.",

The meats were all delicious and the choice of sides was out of this world.  I enjoyed the salad bar as much as the meats.  The server was really good about getting the meats we requested brought around and they were not stingy with the portions when serving you. The garlic steak was my personal favorite and the rack of lamb was next, the hearts of palm, beets, different selection of salad dressings, potatoes was .We are definitely looking forward to our next visit!!!!",

I have celebrated my last 3 birthdays here and I make sure everyone in my party tips greatly because that's the kinda person I am. I was really good friends with the General Manager David back in the day. I recently went to Texas de Brazil and I have 8 people with me. I had a reservation and the hostess refused on seating us because 3 people were missing. I said are you serious? We finally get sat and everything seems to be going great till we get our checks. I had 2 nurses in my group and they informed me they give discounts for doctors and nurses and ETC. I then say oh that's great. I get my servers attention and I then tell him I'm actually a doctor DVM. The servers than say oh it's only for regular doctors. I look at him and say are you kidding? A doctor is still a doctor whether it's humans or animals. I discard his stupid comment and ask him if he can add my bill to my friends since they are nurses and he looks at me and says I have to ask my manager because of the bill Is already discounted and all. It was so embarrassing for me and my guest. I just then paid but I admit I didn't tip because I was disappointed. For a 50 dollar restaurant, the service was terrible. I guess I won't be attending this place ever again.",

    "text": "Came here for my boy's bachelor party dinner and we were all thoroughly impressed.  Meat upon meat upon meat upon meat.  Even our vegetarian friend was able to eat, although only from the \"salad\" bar; luckily for a lower price.  The meat was fantastic, the service was great, (although I learned a thing or to about it, which I will report upon in a bit), the \"salad\" bar was great.  So if everything was so great, why the four stars?    Yes, everything tasted fantastic but the price point is off.  I know that you are getting AYCE and that the food is of a higher quality but something seemed off.  I eat a ton so I was fine paying the price but all of my other buddies ate so little (comparatively) so it seemed unfair that they would have to shell out as much as I did.    When it comes to the service, all of the meat waiters were swarming our table for the first 15 minutes and then it slowed, which is fine but then 10 minutes later, it just about stopped completely even though we still had our green cards out.  Turns out you can have any meat waiter sent to your table if you ask your waitress which is really nice, I just wish we would've been told that instead of waiting for 15 minutes with an empty plate of food, looking around for any meat waiter to come by.  Really good place with really good food.  I am surprised it took me this long to go there and will definitely be back!",

Our waitress was not friendly or nice, we felt rushed. She spilled ice at one person and tapped another's fork with the ice pitcher. Service was below basic standards for this type of restaurant even with the promotional pricing.

    "text": "Came here for dinner with my parents the other night on Tuesday evening. I had set a reservation 2 weeks prior and got a broad pick of reservation times available. My mom's coworker had a VIP card that they had gotten earlier in the year that allows 10 stamps/people at 50% off before the expiration date (in this case, was 09/27/18).   Lunch. $32.99, salad area only $19.99 Dinner. $51.99, salad area only $29.99 Weekend Lunch. $51.99, salad area only $29.99  We had arrived promptly at 7pm and there were tons of people waiting around the entrance outside and inside the restaurant. We were told to wait about 5 minutes and it was fairly accurate. After they cleared out a few parties around us, we were sat down at a table as well.   Salad area w/ a wide range of stuff ranging from sliced tomatoes and mozzarella balls to hearts of palm to smoked salmon, various salads, charcuterrie like salami and prosciutto, and pineapple carpaccio  Hot items like moqueca fish stew, lobster bisque, sauteed mushrooms  At the table, the waitress brings garlic mashed potatoes, sweet fried bananas, and brazilian cheese bread.   I recall the mashed potatoes had a texture similar to aligot (thick, almost malleable). Brazilian cheese bread still as good as i remembered.   This is my 3rd time coming to TdB but last visit was at least 5 years ago. Reason why I haven't came back was due to TdB being the highest priced brazilian bbq and they were quite salty overall.   This time, surprisingly, the meats were much more flavorful and less salty. The \"Picanha\", \"Lamb Chop\", and \"Garlic Filet\" were my favorites this time around.   According to wiki/YouTube/etc, \"Picanha\" is essentially the \"cap\" of the top sirloin, before the 3rd? blood vessel, or something like that. Cut WITH the grain to skewer and cook, but cut AGAINST the grain when eating. MmmMmm But simply said, its a strip of meat, with a cap of fat on top, making each bite have a little piece of fat ! The slices with a roasted edge and slices w/o both are good in their own ways.   Lamb chops is lamb chops. Nice, flavorful little tomahawks of lamb. Add a little chimichurri and MMmmMmm ! Mildly overcooked though...  3rd one, i wasn't sure if it's \"Garlic Filet\" or \"Garlic Picanha\"... Only thing listed w/ garlic is picanha but i recall them saying filet... Anyway ! its like a small nugget of meat, more resembling filet. Nice flavor.   Brazilian Sausage was flavorful and firm. I think good for breakfast. HAHA ! Flank steak was fairly tender as well.   I picked up some asparagus and sauteed mushrooms to eat with the meat, which helps make it not to boring.   Service was really good. The waitress who helped us frequently checked up on us, kept my water cup full, even when it barely went down. Also ! she helped send some \"special requests\" over if there are things you want and havent gotten or what not.   Unfortunately, this stomach is no where near what it used to be able to hold. So didn't get to try as much of a variety. Opt'ed to just get picanha a few times over to satisfy a craving and not hunt for picanha around town to try to make it myself. XD Good meal with the deal i came for. Otherwise, kind of steep for how much i can eat nowadays (sad face)",

They give you the options of how well you like your steaks cooked and would bring out some if the meat you want isn't out. Me and my SO wanted to try their rib meat and they brought it out for us.

Their market buffet of additional side dishes has a good variety, and is prepared a lot better. I find their cheese selection tastes fresher. The meat they serve... Just drooling just thinking about it all. My husband's favorite is their House Sirloin, and I love me some lamb. NUM NUM NUM NUM NUM. XD Okay, when I talk about good customer service, I don't mean just checking on how your meal is going. That's like up to par. Whenever we go here, the meat servers actually like talking to us, cracking a few jokes here and there about your cooked preferences. The last time we went, my husband appreciated how a few during the lunch hour came back with his preferences as soon as a meat skewer was ready. LOL. It helped getting seated close to the kitchen. As for cocktails, my fave cocktail happens to be their mojitos. Just keep those coming. If anyone has room for dessert, be aware that their cakes are huge slices. Not a big fan of those though 'cause they taste like they're given the least amount of attention, and came straight outta the cooler.  It all adds up though, even if you eat a meal there during lunch. My husband and I spent between $150-$175 for a weekend lunch that includes 2-3 cocktails and gratuity.",

My only complaint was my reservation.  I had called in at 4 pm to make a reservation for 6:30. She offered a 5:15 or a 7:45 since they were fully booked in between. We took the 7:45 arriving 3 minutes early to check in to find our name was never put on the reservation list. They did quickly resolve the situation making us only wait 7 minutes.

The atmosphere was very warm and inviting with dark colors which is typical of a steakhouse with Brazilian music playing adding to the great vibe.  As soon as you walk up to the building the aroma in the area is the heavenly scent of grilled meats.  Yes, the meats are the star of the show but the Feijoada (stew), lobster bisque and array of wonderful selections on the salad bar were amazing.     Our server was a wonderful hostess and familiarized us with the dining experience for the evening.  She also informed us that we would each receive a complimentary dessert which was part of their Easter special.    If you have picky little eaters, you may want to leave them at home.  Our kids are picky and only consumed the meat but they definitely enjoyed the meat.  My daughters favorites were the parmesan crusted pork and filet mignon.  My son enjoyed the flank steak and and filet mignon.    I am truly a lover of Feijoida and really struggle with having an extra serving of it and the Brazilian cheese bread or another slice of meat.    They also served delicious warm candied bananas and garlic mashed potatoes with the meal.    Parking was plentiful and location was great to walk around after dinner looking at all the shops.  It was a great experience and we will definitely return.",

Claudio our server was very well spoken, always asking us if we need anything and water and drinks are never left empty. The staff serving the meat are always there. I never had to flag anybody because there's always somebody rounding and asking if you want what they have. I was blown away by their efficiency. Usually in other places you have to flag down someone or get their attention to go to your table.  Texas de Brazil is hands down the best Brazilian steak house I've been and I've been to a lot.  They also gave a free birthday cake with a candle for my cousin and comped us 20% off because I'm a nurse. Definitely coming back!!",

It's a little bit expensive for dinner but it's totally worth it because it's all you can eat, fresh steaks that server brings straight to your table, you can pick as many choices as you want, from frank steak (it's my faaaaaaaaavorite), filet mignon wrapped in bacon, lamp chops, braised beef ribs, Brazilian sausage...etc. Their Brazilian cheese bread and sweet fried bananas are the bomb. They are soooo good!!! I also love their deserts like carrot cake, Brazilian papaya cream and cheesecake, very yummy!!!  The restaurant is very roomy, great for family or big groups. Customer service is top notch. They are very friendly, fast, attentive, and very professional.

As someone who isn't a huge meat eater I headed to the salad bar and I loved all the options. Everything I tried was delicious! I especially loved the lobster bisque. My big surprise was at how much I enjoyed the meat, so good! Better than other high end steakhouses we've tried. My husband was in Heaven, and by the end I was so full I thought I might die. LOL   Our waiter, Richie was amazing and we will request his section when we return.",

Usually, in March, they offer a VIP dining card, which is $60 for 12 meals at half off. Although I passed this year, it's still worth the full price.  This is my wife's and my go-to place for special occasions. We had our first date at TdB. The Event Manager, Monique, and one of the GM's helped me plan my extravagant marriage proposal at TdB. And now, my wife and I returned after our wedding a couple weeks ago. They always treat us great, and the food is phenomenal.  I could go on about the food for days, but the experience can be neatly summarized as an all-you-can-eat, gourmet meat buffet that comes to you! Whether you like filet mignon, sirloin, flank, or ribs, ir pork, or lamb, or sausage...TdB is a meat-eater's heaven on Earth. Don't forget the incredible salad bar, the best in town (everything from prosciutto, to sushi, to palm hearts and cous cous, lobster bisque, shrimp...the list goes on). Careful though...don't pull the rookie mistake of filling up on the salad bar...or the delicious cheesy bread balls at the table. Save room for lots of fried bananas with cinnamon and sugar (free at the table), and the dessert options are insanely good too.  Thank you, TdB, for always providing everything I could ever want in a meal!",

    "text": "Food: 9/10 Service: 10/10 Price: 7/10 Atmosphere: 8/10  Texas de Brazil is simply amazing. It is a Brazilian Steakhouse  meaning that you have about 7-10 selections of meat to pick from in various styles (rare-well-done). The meat is carried on skewers and hand cut from the skewer right to your plate.   The food is awesome. The selections include beef, lamb, chicken and pork. There are also additional items that get added on every few months. But lets be honest you are really going for the steak, which is perfect because you literally have every part of the cow to choose from. I would recommend the garlic sirloin, flank steak, and of course the top sirloin. If you don't like meat don't worry, there is also a salad bar with options ranging from salad to soup to sushi. I usually don't deal with that area too much (gotta save room for the meat lol) but I've only heard good things.  The waiters/ waitresses are awesome and take really good care of you while you're there, providing excellent suggestions as well as giving you information about the whole experience. (RACHEL IS THE BEST!!) The gauchos are super nice and will even ask if you have any special requests once they see that your aren't selecting the meats that have come by. If you say yes, you are the first to receive the meat and it is cooked in whichever style you prefer.   Finally, the biggest knock on Texas de Brazil is the price. Yes, it is $50 per person but you do get unlimited meat and unlimited salad bar access for as long as you wish so it really pays for itself. The experience, food, and service are well worth it and you definitely wouldn't regret spending a family/date night at Texas de Brazil",

    "text": "I wish it was an option for no stars.  The absolute worst experience I've ever had. Management doesn't care that your not happy with service. I was forced to pay 80 dollars for 2 pieces of meat. I was by passed continuously by waiters and did not receive quality service, compared to the tables of white diners sitting behind me. In the severs defense some people in my party had already closed out, but they are suppose to check for the green flip cards. I was served 2 pieces of meat in 2 hrs. I was offered the same meat four times.  I came with intentions of eating a full meal, and left hungry after spending 2hrs at this restaurant . Worst experience of my life. Spoke with every member of management to try and rectify the situation. Not even an apology, but instead they informed me that they couldn't tell how many pieces of meat I ate. Petty management and petty practices. Was treated like a run a way slave and called a liar. No respect or fucks were given and no reasonable solutions were offered. Once Told management the truth about how I felt and nothing was done. I was a man of my word, the check was 67.00,  I paid 80 dollars only because I was being forced to stay inside the restaurant  and I didn't want problems. I told the manager to his face that I no longer wanted to be in the restaurant after receiving such horrible service.  They wanted me to stay longer and finish my meal, but why would I when the service was already horrible.  Forgot to mention the 40 min wait for the mixed drink we ordered as soon as we got to the table. We will be contacting the corporate office on Monday morning.",

There's something for everyone, even the pickiest water as they also have a salad bar, soup, variety of cheeses and charcuterie. I love the chimichurri sauce and sauteed mushrooms.  I'm not a key lime pie kind of gal but my spouse ordered it and it was delish! Our server was friendly and patient with our restless infant - yes, I bring my infant to dinner because a girls gotta eat and I LOVE to eat!",

    "text": "This is our favorite AYCE meat restaurant. discovered this chain while on the east coast, and was happy it came to Las Vegas. we don't eat that much meat at home, so I think we get our fair share when we dine here. who can resist trying all of the meats? although, bacon wrapped chicken isn't that special to me, so I usually bypass that skewer. the meats are cooked to all wellness levels, although the picahna which is the house special, usually comes out med rare. I don't like it dripping blood, so I tell the server I like it medium and he will come back with medium. supposedly there are 17 kinds of meats, I am not sure I've seen all 17, but we have our favorites. picahna, garlic sirloin, flank steak, bacon wrapped filet mignon, lamb chops that tops our lists, oh and the sausage! always have to have one of those!  There is a huge salad bar that you could easily fill up on, and if you aren't a meat eater, it will be your meal. A friend who dined with us  once said, that only amateurs fill their plates with salad, because you will have no room for meat.  it's True, but who can resist? I love the bacon pieces they have on the bar. I'll usually get some romaine with blue cheese dressing and bacon pieces. mind you, they aren't bits! I also like to eat them with the cheese bread that comes on the table with mashed potatoes and fried bananas. those fried bananas are another favorite.  we sometimes forgo dessert for another plate of bananas. on the occasion that we can get a dessert for free, we usually get creme brulee  (hubby) key lime (me) and cheesecake or bananas foster pie just depends on the mood.  The best deal about this place used to be the BOGO if you had a birthday or anniversary.  you'd have to sign up for the eclub. but they stopped doing that for couple years now  now they have the dining card for 12 half price meals for $59.99. money goes to charity and they usually come out in March and you have until September to use it up. We've gotten one for the last few years and it's such a great deal. we always say maybe we need to buy 2, but that never happens because sometimes we aren't home for the summer months at a time, and so we end up having to eat there once a week, which is ALOT of meat!",

The salad bar is more like a what should I not eat or try. There is even a nice five pounds of bacon on a plate to put on your salad. There is four different kinds of soup.   As of for the meat all that you can stand. Pork, beef, chicken, and lamb. Some with bacon wrapped some not. My favorite is the lamb. And I usually don't eat lamb. The flavoring of the lamb chops is perfect. I was able to devour 25. I was told the record is 31. Try to beat it! That's a lot of meat.",

Unfortunately our waiter came to explain everything to us, but his voice was so low we couldn't quite hear everything. But he had no problem answering our questions.  The salad bar was amazing and once we flipped our cards to green, the meat came and it all basically melts in your mouth, especially the braised ribs. They have at least 20 different meats,  mainly Beef, Pork, Lamb, Chicken, and Sausage. No seafood,  sadly enough. The garlic mashed potatoes were light and delicious. It was quite an experience. We even got dressert! I ordered 2 scoops of a vanilla ice-cream while my husband got the chocolate mousse cake. ABSOLUTELY DELICIOUS!!!!!  I can't wait to return.",

Everything is fresh and delicious.  The meat were all very tasty. Tender, juicy and just so mouthwatering (orgasm in my mouth type of deal) I fasted all day just for this. The leg of lamb was a bit rare for me, but everything else was delectable and outstanding.   We had a little room for desert, as for chocolate lovers we had the chocolate mouse, it was dark but not too dark it was perfect.  I have enjoyed every one of my visits here. Thank you for making my husbands first time here enjoyable and making our date night memorable. Spending the money in this was so worth it.",

He was so sharp, and read our body language, immediately noticing if we needed refills ect. As soon as we sat down we flipped the green card and them became bombarded by meats. The meat was cooked to perfection, and perfectly seasoned. The carvers that came around were also very attentive, and polite.  We also received a complimentary desert only 1 of 6 choices from email for signing up on the website.  The Bad: The salad bar was tasty, I just wish they had more choices for sides to pair with meat.  My husband wasn't a fan of the salad bar, he didn't really care for anything in the salad bar.  The Ugly: None.  Overall, We both agreed that this place is a hit. The service here is OUTSTANDING! the food is also wonderful! We well be coming back and reffering our friends and family!   P.S.   We came for lunch (11:30) the crowd started pouring in about 12-12:30.",

And since we were in Las Vegas, why not try this popular place out! First off, I highly recommend making reservations like we did even for a party of two. It was definitely busy at around 6 PM, so make reservations so you don't wait long.   Like I mentioned above, there is an unlimited buffet which included a variety of salads, cheese, salami, veggies, sushi, soups, breads, and other various foods to accompany your meat. Your table also automatically receives mashed potatoes, mini bread rolls, and plantains. If the soup of the day is the lobster bisque - get it! Nice way to start the service. I recommend not taking a lot good from the buffet area because it may make you full before you even try your meats!  And once you sit down you can start trying the various meats they have to offer! All come out steaming hot and there are servers who come around asking if you want a particular meat from different cuts of steak, chicken, sausage, lamb, etc. There's a small sign that you flip to green if you want meat and a red one to say no thanks. We absolutely loved the flank steak! It had a nice small fat layer to meat that made it super delicious! We had to keep asking for more! Wish we got to try every cut of meat, but our stomachs wouldn't allow us!  The waitress and service was spot on! She was always attentive and recommended drinks and buffet food to try out. Also, if you haven't seen a particular meat come out for a while, she can get the server to bring the meat around.   Next time we come to Vegas, we're definitely coming here again!",

The black beans and rice were delicious too.  Let's not forget the real stars of the evening though.  The meat!  My husband's favorite was the bacon wrapped filet mignon.  I liked the top sirloin, beef ribs and chicken.  We don't eat pork or lamb so I can't tell you how those were. :)  Our server was Abel and he definitely took care of all of our needs.  Icing on the cake was the Brazilian Cheesecake for dessert which we split.  The manager comped our dessert since it was my birthday.  Nice bonus.  Treat yourself and go enjoy a meal here.  It is well worth it!",

I mean, who doesn't like all you can eat steak, filet mignon, lamb, and everything else you need to add 6.9 inches to your bicep. Perfect place to bring a girl for a first (and last) date. You can't go wrong here. Texas de Brazil is gassssss",

    "text": "Ah, the meat lovers paradise! I hadn't been to Texas de Brazil in quite awhile, but it was as I remembered. The salad bar isn't all that exciting, but you come for the meat, right? The standouts for me on the salad bar were the fish stew, which had a great flavor and big chunks of fish in it. The potatoes au gratin were nice and cheesy, and the garlic shrimp was also pretty good. I appreciated having some seafood options amidst all of the meat we were about to feast upon.  This was probably the first time I've been here that I didn't stuff myself silly. I was very strategic and didn't eat everything that came around, so I could really enjoy the things I did. My favorites were the bacon wrapped filet (although the first piece was definitely better than the second), the lamb chop, and the bbq brisket.   I only had a few bites of the mashed potatoes, but they were as expected. The caramelized banana was great, we actually ate that as a dessert. And I enjoyed the bread puffs too. We also received a complementary dessert to celebrate our anniversary, which we took to go. Don't be fooled, the slice of carrot cake you get won't be nearly as big as the one on the display tray!   Our server was pleasant and attentive and all of the meat servers were great as well. I may not be back for awhile, but I will return!",

The waiter we had was awesome the whole night, quick and attentive service and super friendly, helpful and informative with all his recommendations.  As for the dinner service, it was $50 a person. (Dessert not included) The salad bar was pretty standard self serve. My personal favorite option was the Lobster Bisque, tastes great. The meat selection was ridiculous in a good way. Every selection of the meats on the skewer swords looked mouth watering! I tried pretty much most of the meats offered for dinner.  My personal favorites: -Braised Beef Ribs -Bacon Wrapped Filet Mignon -Brazilian Sausage  -Flank Steak  -Brazilian Picanha  Overall, the experience here at the Vegas location was a good one. High quality cuts and high quality tasting meats! I would come back again here in Vegas or the California location only if the service is just as good. Texas de Brazil is one of the better Churrascaria Steakhouse's I have been to.",

    "text": "I gave this restaurant a 4 star review because of how great the service and the food was. My husband is Brazilian and we have spent a good deal of time in Brazil. This was very similar to steak houses in Brazil.  It was a little rushed with how quickly the meat kept coming out, but you have the green and red signals to let them know if they should stop at your table or not so you can pace yourself.  I ordered a mango caipirinha and that was the only aspect of the food/drink I was disappointed with. I generally don't order caipirinhas in the states because they don't come with muddled fruit, but the menu said it was made that way so I took a chance. They actually muddle lime (which I thought was strange since it was a fruit caipirinha) and then they put the fruit juice on top of it. That was the only thing I wouldn't recommend here.  The reason I am rating this restaurant lower than a five and considered a three was the level of noise. There was a big group in the back that was cheering and screaming for the majority of our meal. It was a little bit like having dinner in a noisy Chuck E Cheese. I could tell we weren't the only table disappointed that we were not able to hear anything except the big party. My disappointment wasn't as much with the fact the party was being disruptive, but that no one came around to apologize and it didn't seem like anything was being done to make sure the rest of the guests were still able to enjoy their meals.",

Admittedly, I didn't spend a lot of time on side dishes but the sauteed mushrooms, prosciutto, and fresh mozzarella were all very tasty. The lobster bisque was also on point, but I'm not sure if that was a nightly special or a common place.   On to the meat, don't waste your time with chicken. It's not because its not good, but seriously with that much freshly grilled steak flying your way, why waste time (and valuable stomach space)  Highlights were the sirloin, flank, and bacon wrapped filet. The sausages were surprisingly good and the pork ribs were extremely tender and delicious. Cooked to perfection.   Thiago, our waiter was very nice and humble. We had a really great conversation, he took very good care of us, and we really liked his company. A+",

All the staff were working together to ensure that the patrons were taken care of. Even the managers were bussing tables and making up tables.

But they never did, so about an hour later we returned, and were told they would sit us in about five minutes... About 15 minutes later we asked again and were told \"a few more minutes\"... 20 minutes later we asked again, and at this point the hostess told my husband, who was obviously upset, that we \"got here at 6 and your wait time was an hour\"... it was 7:40!!! It still took another 5 minutes to get seated.  We would have left but it was my birthday and my husband had promised to take me to this restaurant because I wanted to try it so bad.

    "text": "We love this restaurant. It's always a must when we're in Vegas. The food and service are excellent. The salad bar is simply exquisite, from the cheeses to various salad selection and lobster bisque, it's all really great. Plus the mashed potatoes and platano they serve your table are so stinkin good, it's really tough to save room for the meat but somehow I manage lol. My absolute favorite are the lamb chops. I never even really liked lamb until this place. After dipping the perfectly marinated & roasted meat in their mint jelly, it's like eating candy or better yet, maybe manna. It's that good. The house sirloin is our other favorite followed by the flank steak. Aside from the food, all of the servers are excellent & Douglas is our favorite.",

    "text": "Unfortunately we were put in a corner table in the back next to a servers table and the meat service was absolutely terrible.  There was two servers (chicken and sausage) that would check on us but all the other servers bringing around all the beef, lamb, and pork meats that we read about here on help were non existent, they just ignored us probably because of the table we were seated at.  It is very obvious they have a routine route down and our table was not part of their routine.  We even attempted to yell and get their attention, however, the restaurant was very loud so we assumed they could not hear us.  The salad bar was good, but I assure you it is not worth $50 per person.  I have no doubt the restaurant is good based on its reviews, unfortunately my wife and I did not get the opportunity to experience the meats that you pay for due to inattentive servers and seating location.",

    "text": "If you've never been to Texas de Brazil, you're in for an experience unlike most others. Contrary to a typical dining experience where you order from the menu, at TdB you take a seat, order your beverage and the food is served on the spot. Your table will be approached continuously by numerous servers each offering a prepared selection of meat: bacon wrapped filet mignon, BBQ flank steak, beef rib, garlic sirloin, lamb chops, rotisserie chicken, sausage, pork loin and more. The flank steak stood out as the best of the bunch. If you've eaten too much, flip over a marker that informs the server you're full; they wont offer any more. Flip it over when you're hungry again and the meat keeps a comin'.   A salad bar is available with a large selection of prepared salads, meats. cheeses and some salmon. You can build your own salad as well, but I found it to be lacking most of the basic ingredients of a typical salad: chopped tomato (Or cherry tomato), diced onion, cucumber, spinach, black olive and egg. Yes, they have bacon bits and croutons. You can however get creative and just top off the lettuce with some of the prepared salads and lay dressing over the top (Meh?). A prepared chick pea salad seemed to help. They offer sliced tomato, but it seems odd to lay it on top of a salad. It's meant to be tasted with fresh mozzarella and balsamic.  A hot-station has au gratin potatoes, fish, beans and a couple other options. Don't fill up on all these offerings however; you'll need room for the abundance of beef, pork. chicken and sausage. At this particular location, it was very busy and our service was sub-par. The people seated in the middle of the restaurant were getting flooded with meat offerings. We were set off to the side and spent several minutes waiting for someone to come over. The server offered me another glass of club soda. What he didn't tell me is that I'd be charged $3.50 for every glass. Most restaurants will charge you for the first glass and give refills for free. Not at TdB. I spent over $10 on three glasses of club soda: nice way to run up the bill mr server. When finished, we waited a long time for our plates to be cleared and for desert to be offered.   For desert I ordered Creme Brulee and a glass of Chalk Hill Chardonnay ($13 for the wine...not bad). The Chardonnay however was served in a water glass shaped somewhat similar to a wine glass. This glass is not suitable for wine though. What happens when you order a 1995 Chateau Latour for $2500? Do they serve it in a water glass????  As this is unacceptable, I went to the bar in search of a wine glass (I wasn't willing to wait around for our server to return.) When I went to the bar, I expecting to see a fine collection of wine glasses (They have top-dollar bottles on that wine menu). Low and behold, there are none. I asked the bartender if they had a wine glass. She handed me a water glass. I informed her that this is a water glass and that I needed a wine glass. After some scrambling, she produced a Bordeaux glass. Ahhh.....they do have wine glasses, but only for those who spend the big bucks. On the table to our right, they ordered a bottle a wine. Yes, it was served in water glasses. I guess they didn't spend enough money.  The Creme Brulee was fine, but not above average. I should have ordered the cheese cake. Aside from banana cream pie, the other offerings wouldn't have paired up well with the wine (Chocolate cake?).  Many people have complained about TdB meats being too salty. I understand why this is a so. Many of the meats, but not all, are seasoned about as much as possible without it being over-seasoned. For some folks, this will come across as tasting like sea water on the palate. IMO, it was a touch on the salty side, but not to the point of error. Perhaps on some days they get a little carried away with the seasoning. They probably have seasoning shakers in the kitchen. If careless, it would be easy to ruin a good dish.  I think you should experience TdB. The experience is unique and everything is well prepared. That being said, it's clearly over-priced. Our meal was 50% off and I still spent $65 including tip: $25 for the meal, $13 for the wine, $10 for the club sodas and $9 for the desert. I don't care how you slice it; it was not a $95 meal. They served my wine in a water glass. LOL. TdB is much like a buffet, but instead of walking up to it, the buffet comes to you...and it's all meat. Try it one time and decide for yourself if you'll go back. Pay the $50 for the meal, buy a drink and skip the desert. I would go back, but order cautiously.  If you're thinking of taking a date here, think twice unless you are certain that person is a die-hard meat lover. Of course, you could pass on the meat and just order the salad bar.....$20.",

He made sure we had our opportunity to try every choice that came around. He even watched us from afar and redirected the food to us- the ones we had our eye on. Dessert was also very delicious. They're served with designs, and from my experience, they are big portions. My family and I were so full and satisfied. Definitely recommending this place to family and friends.",

The website did not make it clear that there are two of these restaurants and the number that first pops up is for their Newport Beach location. I made reservations which were confirmed once again before we showed up. I was never told my reservations were for the Newport Beach location. Had I known there were two locations, I would have made it clear we wanted the Las Vegas location.   We showed up for our 6:30 reservation in Las Vegas and were met by a very snooty (and I'm being nice) woman at the front desk. She just shook her head, with her snooty nose in the air and told us we had no reservation. Then some guy in a tuxedo came over and told us that there was nothing he could do for us. We left and called the number on the website and of course the Newport Beach location answered. The girl on the other line told us that this was not the first time this had happened and laughed about it. The service at this place is lacking to say the very least.",

    "text": "This last time when I brought my significant other for a very special date, I was very disappointed. Up until my last experience, I loved this place and brought people every time they are in town! I have easily been here over 25 times. Many of my colleagues also frequent here.  The coffee was cold when it came to the table, not warm actually cold and our reservations were at 1230 which is only 30 minutes after they open. When my new coffee did come out no new creamer or sugar was brought to the table with it, which I do not recall ever having to ask to be done so I waited with my black coffee until the waiter made his way to us again. My hunny was never asked if he would like a refill on his drink the entire meal. It was just one thing after another on this visit and is so surprising for a place that is usually flawless. Next I informed our server I have a cinnamon allergy and asked for the fried bananas without cinnamon as I always do and this time they arrived soggy lacking the usual chefs integrity. Even when I told our server about my severe allergy he seemed scared to request them and emphasized that it would take quite some time because they just made a large batch of the ones with cinnamon. I informed him I was aware they would take some time which is why I ordered them early while we ordered the drinks. It was also the first time I had a cut of meat completely over done, I mean it was rubbery and charred which is also not the norm for this place. The ribs usually melt right off the bone and were tough this time too. Usually every different meat that comes around to your table here is perfection, but not so on this visit.   Lastly, the manager actually noticed I had a comment card in my hand and made a point to walk my pace to time perfectly meeting me at the exit and receive my card. I was impressed! Until he failed to address the comment card. We actually were standing outside the establishment for about 15 minutes talking about our experience and planning our next place to go. And not so much as a  personal apology, phone call or email! Which lead me to believe he just chucked my comment card. The card even says printed right on it... don't wait to write us a bad review let us fix it now... Epic Fail!",

I'm a member of three VIP Dining Cards just know and I brought any time new guests to this restaurant. Also this time.  We were 6 Person. 4 of us had a VIP card with 50% Discount (we paid for this VIP cards: $180). The another two Persons (brand new guests) had no VIP Card. They had a 10% coupon direct from Texas de Brazil.  The Manager don't accept the 10% discount for the another first coming brand new two guests.   Declaration by the Manager: We can not combine two offers.  My answer was: We don't combine two offers. 4 guests pay with the 50% VIP card and the another two new guest pay seperately with the 10% discount offer from your restaurant. Manager: No, you sit on the same table!  Result: We gave $0 Tip and this restaurant lost at this moment 2 brand new returning guests and we will eat no longer there also. We change the Brazilian Steak house here in Vegas to: \"Fogo de Chao\" with a better customer service. Congratulation Manager Jose Garcia for this success. I never bring new guests to you restaurant and we spend no more money in your restaurant.",

After 8 we were finally being seated and I noticed MANY empty tables to hold 6 people.  Once we were settled in the waiter made us forget the long wait. He made sure we were well taken care of and had everything we desired. The food was ok.

Everything else is great; it is a meat heaven for meat lovers with just about anything you can think of that can be served on a skewer. Place is very classy too, great for a date or even a business meeting; just make sure everybody shows up for the reservation because they will not seat you until the whole party is there, which is now understandable as they try to make use of every chair because of how busy they are, and it was on a Wednesday!",

We are always served by very courteous and friendly waiters. The meats are cooked to our liking and come around often. If there's a particular cut or meat we want, the server is quick to get the meat dude to us.  Salad bar area is fully stocked with delicious offerings. I have learned to not eat it all because you will NOT have room for the meats! The grape salad is so delicious. I always save room for that. Onion ceviche is a must when eating the rich meats.  Chimichurri is really good. I rarely eat the mashed potatoes, but when I do, man. Buttery fat inducing goodness. The lil cheese breads are as good as any other place I've been to. I wish I had more room in my stomach to hold them all.  I look forward to coming to the restaurant each time. I dare say I am a bit of an addict.  Highly recommended to my friends and definitely think you should check this place out if you're into churrascaria!",

    "text": "Finally had a chance to try this place and YES, it is really good! If you've ever been to a Brazilian Steakhouse, then you know that they have a salad bar matched with people walking around with meat.  Be sure to \"flip over\" your table card from RED to GREEN so the meat can begin!  My favorite cuts were the flank steak and House Special Top Sirlion both rare to medium rare.  The top sirlion is the one that kind of looks like it's heart shaped once they cut through it. I can just taste the fat! You can't miss it.  The chicken cuts were okay. Some of the other cuts were too salty.  I do remember the sausage being a tasty as well.    The salad bar did have cuts of cheese, some sushi, but I didn't spend too much time there.   Thankfully we got some gift cards as gifts otherwise this place is really pricey.  You can reserve a table online!  NEGATIVES:   - It was Saturday night dinner time when we were there.  The service, everytime they did come, they were great but with so many tables I felt like we barely saw our server. - LOUD! It was difficult to hear our conversations across the table.  Maybe it was because it was full but be prepared.",

    "text": "Having the good fortune of experincing Gaucho Style Churrascaria eating in the countries where it originated, Brasil and Argentina (in the region known as the Pampas), I tend to be a little more critical than those reviewers new to this style of dining.   First, let me say the attitude and the service of the staff is very good, and would merit 4 stars. The server was constantly checking on the table and made sure that all would be enjoying the meats of their choice, prepared as requested. But there is more to it than great service when judging a Brasilian Style churrascaria.  Sad to say that more isn't always better. I found the meat to be inferior in quality, portion, and preparation. Since a Churrascaria is \"all you can eat\", expect to find very average buffet quality meats. Don't expect you are going to enjoy the same quality of Steak Place, such as Morton's, The Palm, or Del Frisco's.   Think of the experience at Texas de Brasil, as dining at \"rich man's\" Golden Corral.   I give the food 2 Stars. Therefore, 4 star service and 2 star food, average out to be a 3, and considering dinner is about $50 per person, that 3 is a generous rating.",

    "text": "We used to frequent this place quite a bit, but no longer do so for several reasons:  First let me say the food is good. Meats are cooked to perfection and the salad bar is extensive and refreshing. The salads, cheeses, and lobster bisque are all of high quality, and seasoned perfectly.   However, the last time we went to Texas de Brazil I was greeted by a rude hostess who had no interest in accommodating a simple request (a table on the side of the Restaraunt so my children did not interrupt anyone else's meal). So when the waiter came around, I asked to be moved and the gracious waitstaff accommodated us. I simply want to be courteous to other diners and not interrupt someone else's good time if my children get restless.  The food was excellent, and so was the service. Our waiter was attentive and provided every special request of meat that we asked for. I was not expecting what came next...  Prices: I was expecting $45 a plate for adults, $5 for my 10 year old, and no charge for my 6 and 2 year olds, just as the snotty hostess told us. What I got when I looked at the receipt was $50 a plate for the adults, $25 for my 10 year old, and $5 each for my 6 and 2 year olds. That is not including drinks or dessert. I asked the waiter why the tab was so off, and he stated the prices had been raised. I was not advised of this, and the hostess specifically gave me different numbers.   I paid and left. I didn't even want to both with speaking to management because I was so disgusted with the hostesses attitude and lack of knowledge which cost me an additional $45. The food is good. The overall experience is good, but Fogo de Chao gets an additional 2 stars for at least having competent, professional, and POLITE staff.",

The only (tiny) issue I had the whole night was that their sushi rolls were all crab, and I'm allergic. I was told they were delicious, either way.   If you're reading this, EAT AT THIS PLACE.

Walked in around 2 pm and had to wait for maybe 2 minutes for our table. Server almost immediately came to get our drinks. I started off with the lobster bisque which was delicious. I try to avoid the cheesy bread but it's almost impossible. Always enjoy the caesar salad and the huge block of Parmesan cheese in the decorative bowl.  Even if you are a vegetation there is plenty to choose from: red quinoa, garlic mashed potatoes, goat cheese spread, asparagus, grape salad, artichokes, onion ceviche, roasted jalapenos, olives, tabouli, couscous, spring mix, potato salad, zucchini , cauliflower salad, cucumber salad, pineapple salad, sugar snow peas, spring mix, green beans, roasted peppers, and sliced tomatoes. Don't forget the tasty sweet fried bananas and garlic mashed potatoes! There is so much meat that is constantly being offered, some of my favorites were filet mignon, lamb chops, and leg of lamb. I also enjoyed tasting the flank steak and beef ribs. They also offer pork and chicken, didn't bother tasting any since that is something I can eat anywhere. Oh my gosh after devouring almost 3000 calories, geez possibly even more you gotta save room for dessert. They have tons of pies, cheesecakes, and flan.  The server was attentive and friendly. Looking forward to getting my birthday email- I'll be back in December!",

Sunday came my boyfriends bday the day was going well we arrived at the restaurant 5 minutes before our reservation at 7pm . The lady said it would be about a 15 minute wait to get seated although we had reservations because there was people ahead of us . We waited 25 minutes In total the ticket that she gave us had a printed time of 7:10 pm that was incorrect because we did not get seated until after 7:20pm .  Got seated the lady said our server wold be right with us ....took him 6 minutes to actually come to our table to tell us to help ourselves at the bar and that people would be walking around with meats ... may I add we ordered 2 sodas at this time ..we went to salad bar area came back NO WATER NO SODAS still 10 MINUTES later we had to flag him down like hello thirsty pregnant girl about to pass out here !!!!. The meat people were great and super speedy almost overwhelming lol but we didn't mind just keep the meats coming haha .  The waiter came by 1 other time to check on us the entire meal by this time we were minutes out of anything to drink .we decided to just get the check and go . He asked if we wanted dessert we declined let me note that when I made the reservation I told her it was my boyfriends bday she said there would be a FREE Dessert for him and the waiter did not even offer or say Happy birthday I was trying to make the best of it and not make a scene on my loves day .  Oh yeah the water (faucet water ) the soft drinks are not included in the meal and neither are the desserts .Forget about them communicating specially on an occasion which I specifically told them about .",

    "text": "This was my first time here and I thought it was great! They have two different prices for lunch and dinner which I think was $32 vs $52. This does include the price of the salad bar and dessert.  It's a very busy and loud inside. There are servers walking around with all different kinds of meat serving it to you if you would like it. They had sirloin, filet mignonette, Parmesan chicken, lamb chops, strip steak, sausage, ribs, pork and some other meat I can't remember. The salad bar is buffet style so you can go whenever you want. They had lobster bisque, salad, all the toppings, different cheeses, bread, au gratin potatoes, etc..  At your table they leave mashed potatoes, plantains, and little cheesy breads that are all you can eat. After you've finished they bring a dessert tray and you pick the dessert of your choice. Choices were flan, Brazilian dessert, coconut pie, cheesecake, chocolate mousse cake, carrot cake, maybe a pecan pie, a caramel type pie, and a few others I also can't remember.",

    "text": "Our server was charming, very attentive and made dinner a wonderful experience on Friday night. Both red and white sangrias were delicious. I have been re-inspired by this Brazilian-style Churrascuria (Fogo has been a terrible disappointment outside of Texas!)  However, despite having a fabulous dinner and would totally come back, here are a few mild issues at Texas de Brazil - Not all meat servers season or cook their meat the same - some are more flavorful than others, and some had better caramelization. Also, the meat tastes best fresh from the fire - where we sat, we often got meat that had cooled off and/or were already carved up so we didn't get the nice caramelized pieces. Finally, since we were dining during the last 90 minutes before closing, many skewers had been sliced down so much that a lot of cuts were really tough, dry and over-cooked (the servers called their cuts \"well-done;\" I felt they were just overcooked, old pieces of meat.)  Other than that, the salad bar was delicious and fresh, the lobster bisque was amazing! The cheese puffs were not quite as great as I remembered - a bit stiff and tough; they should be crisp on the outside, soft and chewy on the inside. The fried bananas were oddly covered with sugar - they should be sweet from the caramelization alone - or at least the sugar should be caramelized onto the banana.",

Waiters carrying meat in skewers that goes around from one table to another, carrying different types of meat and slice it for you fresh from the grill. Ohlala!... A huge salad bar is also my favorite with a lot of different varieties of vegetables and different sides as well. They are like candies to my eyes.  It's a little expensive so it is really good only for special occasions. Going on lunch is cheaper than dinner though. But I can say it's really worth it...  Overall great!

After dining here, of which I have been here multiple times.....it's the protein equivalent of consuming iowaska......not that I would personally know that iowaska is like, but I have heard about on several podcasts that I listen to.  Once you get past the pretentious staff at the front counter, it's a magical experience.  The smell of many different meats roasting in the air helps create the frenzy that is about to come.  Sure you could sample the delicious wares that is the \"salad bar,\"  my recommendation is to visit for the chimichurri to dip your meat in.  Save room for the meat.  Green equals more meat.  Red means to stop the meat....but you'll find that that some of the meat servers are color blind and it just keeps coming.  I have sampled he dessert on a couple of occasions.  My suggestion is to keep grinding on...you guessed it.....MEAT!",

Our server, Ashley was extremely accommodating and showed us how everything worked since it was our first time (A table of 14 people and she still did wonderfully). Everyone who brought the meat around was very polite and made sure everyone got to try each meat a few times. The waters and refills came before we even asked.  Ok so onto the FOOD. Ahhhhhhhhh. So this place has been pretty hyped from basically everyone I know and that can usually diminish it for me since it's so built up. Not for Texas de Brazil! The things that will forever be embedded in my brain is the Guarana Antarctica (Brazilian soda recommended to me by Ashley, bomb AF) the house special, it was some type of steak I can't remember but it was so juicy and delicious, and lastly the beef rib was so tender I didn't even have to chew it. I finished off my meal with the creme brulee that had a unique citrus flavor to it that made it stand out.   GO TO THIS PLACE! 10/10 would recommend :)",

The service he provided was purely FLAWLESS. As soon as we sat down, he greeted us and took our drink orders. When we returned to our table after grabbing our first round through the salad bar he had already placed empty plates on our table for our meats. He also kept our waters topped off without being told, checked on us throughout the meal, and also asked us multiple times if we wanted any specific meats to come to our table. Within minutes of our request, the meats we requested were being sliced and placed on our plates. Thank you Julius for making our recent experience a memorable one!!",

Have you ever been to Golden Corral the cheap buffet? Imagine if they started a steakhouse! That's what this has turned into over the last year. The Red Lobster of steakhouses. Now if you're sitting there thinking \"Red Lobster has great seafood\" then we have different expectations, and you may love this place.   Tough, chewy, poorly seasoned, over cooked.   Meats- ranged from scary rare to crumbly char. The gaucho would describe as medium rare- but what you got ranged from rare to extra well done....You had to pin most of it down with the knife and use the fork to tear it because it couldn't be cut with the knife provided.   Bananas- texture was that of pudding. You couldn't even pick them up with a fork.   Cheese bread- usually great. Not anymore... they changed the recipe. Outer shell was like a crunchy leather. Inside reminded me of a dry biscuit. I buy these frozen from the store and make them at home and they are pretty good. Perhaps they need to start buying the ones from Trader Joe's.   Salad- as a carnivore, I hate to admit was the part of this meal which met expectations.   Soda- ridiculous overpriced tiny bottles of coke, no refills.   Service- meat servers were great. Our server was delinquent. Waters stayed empty. Waited on the check for 20 minutes. Then they bring this awkward little credit card machine over and fumble around and stare at you like a peasant while you enter the tip amount. I always reward good service, but it felt really awkward.   This used to be my go to. I've now had 3 poor experiences... I blame myself, I just kept hoping they would turn it around. I wanted to believe in you, but I must admit defeat. Good bye old friend.",

Took a friend there, made a booking through open table to avoid a long wait. Meat was amazing like usual, salad bar needed some refill (it was 9pm) We had a great diner and time with friends! My friend was amazed by the quality of the meat, Brazilian sausage, beef on the bone, filet Mignon, chicken Parmesan, lamb leg, lamb chop, sirloin and much more. Meat lovers you will be pleased I put 4 stars because of the noise. When it's packed, it's VERY NOISY and almost impossible to have a conversation :-/ Would be so nice for Texas de Brazil to do something about it!",

I visited last Sunday, and noticed immediately a difference in atmosphere, food, and management.  The trendy music has been turned down and the lighting turned up, creating a \"chili's\" type of atmosphere at a high-end steakhouse.  The salad bar was totally missing the smoked salmon (it used to be smoked and cooked to perfection then sliced in cubes) in place of the cheap sushi salmon I could get at an AYCE sushi buffet. The salad bar had been re-modeled (for the worse, how did that happen!), and to top it off I was told that the plantains and biscuits (used to be the best) are not even being served because of a gas issue.  I had to ask for a complimentary desert to try and accommodate the shortcoming, and management approved.  The meat was perfect - no issues there.  Overall,  I wouldn't be surprised if this location changed ownership or management approximately 1 year ago, but what a disappointment when I'm paying 51.99 per person!  Higher prices and lower quality, no thank you.",

The lobster bisque was exquisite. So creamy and comforting. Honestly as far at the meats go, I can't choose a favorite. They were all perfectly cooked. I love my meat rare, practically still mooing, and they didn't disappoint.",

    "text": "My girlfriend and mother had been dying to try this place for months so I decided to take them out and see what all the fuss was about. I could have blown the cash on Mickey D's and been happier. The restaurant is very nice, it's clean, it's spacious, and the whole gimmick of the waiters coming to your table with meat and the variety is great. Brazilian steakhouse is a fabulous idea. But the execution is where they messed up.  The meat- Every single bite had easily 4x the amount of salt anything on this earth ever needs. I don't know if they were just trying to disguise poor quality meat, if they have a giant meat curing room in the back that needs to be coated in salt to keep it edible for months at a time, or if they mistook the meat for cucumbers, tried to soak it in brine for a few weeks or what, but they put entirely too much salt on it!  The salad bar- Their salad bar was more of an ingredient farm. It has good amount of cheese, olives, mushrooms, there's soup, there's every little addition you could want on your fancy salad, except the salad! They had 1 bowl of plain old iceberg lettuce. No spinach no mixed greens not even the laziest premade Caesar salad as a base. So I didn't actually get to make a salad, I got a plate full of salad ingredients to eat individually. Yay..... The service- I know I've ragged on the place a bit but I'm one of those people that expects an expensive place to be worth the price of admission. For this quality I could have taken my family to China Star or something as horrid. The service however, was 100% what you'd expect to receive. The waiter was very polite and smiling the entire time. He was happy to help explain the process, explain the restaurant setup, he asked if we preferred or disliked any particular meat to send us what we wanted, and he was quick to refill any drinks in a timely manner. 10/10 there. My receipt shows Ryan as his name. He single-handedly turned this from a 0/5 to a 3/5. I'll never return and cannot ever recommend this place, but the service I received was absolutely impeccable. This place does not deserve him~",

Salads and sides are fairly standard with a few standouts being the lobster bisque and the cheese bread (seriously more cheese than bread!). But the star of the show is the variety of meats they bring to the table and serve directly to your plate from large metal skewers. Beef, pork, lamb and chicken in a variety of preparations and sizzling hot. Absolutely amazing! And they will keep bringing it as long as you keep eating it.  On the pricey side but well worth it. If you have a hunger for protein this is your place!!",

All I can say is every bite of everything is a magnificent flavor explosion.   My #1 favorite restaurant!!!!!",

    "text": "As a lenient pescetarian, Texas de Brazil may seem contra proferentem, but that doesn't deter any semblance of review to be given. A solid five stars, teetering on the border of four and a half because I aspire for the rankings of Michael Kors, this establishment combines the diadem of service etiquette with an affluent diversity of cuisine, fulfilling both the hedonistic propensity of meat lovers and a conscience for the vegetarian diet.   Let's talk about the controversial matter peppered with bon mots -- pricing is fifty for those who identify as Indominus and half for those who get asked \"if you were stranded on an island, would you eat coconut palms or a cow,\" as if an organism exists in such ecology. This is Las Vegas. If you're pooling sweat over these rates, you might want to get a refund for that three-step easy online degree in geography and start your career in anthropomorphic fur-suit construction. You have come to this city in a pre-mediated agenda: to market yourself as some uber-chic cliche, re-create the events of the Hangover through an arrangement of poorly taken Snapchats, or maybe to meet someone with silicon implants for the first time; but, most of all, to drop a wallet like Beyonce drops an album out of nowhere. So, yes, you can swipe your card with impunity. Don't act like you haven't fed the slot machines your latest paycheck. There's no judgement here.  Normally, I'm against the American restaurant normative that will slaughter anything that walks on at least two legs -- I'm sure you've read Upton Sinclair before -- but unlike your typical factory chain, Texas de Brazil stands proud with a classy ambiance and setting. A giant chandelier, seen in the Old Hollywood Silent Noir; the qualities of a wine-house combined with an exclusive air of upper-class; a secretive bathroom, whose sinks are the definition of pretentious -- they're like vases. It makes Olive Garden look like a pathetic hole in the wall, so this ambiance is part of the price you're paying. After all, I bet their electric bill has two commas.   Now, I won't be shoving words into the mouthes of the carnivores because I know for a fact that they'll be shoving in slabs after slabs of thick, juicy meat. Talk about umami -- you can let it sit in your mouth and enjoy the flavor as the meat keeps coming and coming. For those who need a basic run-down of the protocol, I'll do you a solid: servers, with huge, thick, long, well-cooked, and lathered sticks of meat will walk by you and ask if you want a piece. Ooh la la. Swipe right on everything but the parmesan chicken -- I've heard it's salty in flavor, but to each their own taste, am I right? Now, if you're giving up after your second cut, the secret 411 is that some drone will abduct you and drop you off to a detox center where you'll realize how much money and meat you've wasted. After all, Area 51 is close by. The servers are relentless and will stop at nothing to make sure you've gotten your fill. To illustrate this phenomena, our large party of around twenty five followed the family tradition of prayer -- we have to be grateful, obvi. As I've learned in Screenwriting 101, sub-text is everything. And as we harmoniously prayed about the Lamb of God, servers brought freshly cooked lamb to the table.  To discuss the politics of omnivores yet evade vegetarians is offensive in every right. The coined term salad bar does not do justice to what is provided. Yes, there is salads -- in about three to four different variations; carbohydrates in all of their glory; seafood; and whatever else you want, they probably have it. Cool beans, right? A temperate ambiance, relative position to the Las Vegas scene, service, and the food combines to make a five star experience in Texas de Brazil. As a pescetarian, I firmly vouch for this restaurant.",

We were so physically uncomfortable we had to cut the meal short and left. We felt bloated for almost 2 days. I complained to the server about the saltiness, his response, priceless.. \"I'll let the kitchen know so that when you come next time it might be better.\" REALLY??? I can't make this stuff up! It was my birthday and I didn't want to ruin the night. I paid the bill and figured that I would contact management the next day assuming that they would want to compensate me in some way. No response from management or corporate by phone or email. They truly don't care about their customers, obviously focused on 'location, location' is all that matters.  The Good: Salad bar presentation was good. The quality was good & fresh.  I couple weeks later we went with some friends to Fogo De Chao... Awesome all the way across the board. Pay the extra $3.00 and do it right at Fogo.",

On our second night there we ordered a bottle of wine.  We enjoyed it so we ordered a second bottle - something was wrong with this bottle.  We called the waiter and manager right away.    They took the bottle away, never replaced it and still charged us for the 2nd bottle anyway.  The manager told us \"to bad\" we are charging you no matter what and we can not return the unfinished bottle because we thew it away.  I have left 5 messages and one email for the General Manager over a two week period and - well, i guess keeping customers happy is not important to Texas de Brazil!",

    "text": "I really enjoyed the selection of proteins at Texas De Brazil. The sirloin, skirt steak, and filet mignon were exceptionally moist and tender. However, they were over seasoned with salt so you couldn't taste the quality of the meat. The lamb chops, chicken, and pork were presented as an understatement, however they were some of the best I've had. I wish there was a vegetarian option like tofu and grilled veggies for vegetarians, vegans, etc.       The side dishes were mediocre. The cinnamon and sugar plantains didn't marry with the rest of the meal. In fact, it tasted like an overly sweet Starbucks frappiccinno compared to the fatty meat. The mashed potatoes were extremely creamy and buttery, which complemented the lean chicken breast. The bread was a traditional Brazilian bread with cheese. However, it tasted like an boring roll with string cheese from the school cafeteria.       For dessert, I ordered the creme brulee, which I was impatiently waiting for. It tasted intensely of orange (which is never a bad thing) and weirdly enough, MAYO? It also had the texture of chunky sausage gravy. I recommend that the chef whisk more air bubbles into the custard mix, so it becomes more creamy and airy. Even though there were some things wrong with the meal that was served to me today, I will always enjoy the ambience and party scene of Texas De Brazil!",

Tried not eat too much of salad bar and and get our money worth from the meat.  Lobster bisque was alright, nothing to brag about.  You want lobster bisque go to Joes Stone at Caesars, they make it at your table.  Cheeses and cold cuts were very good, mash potatoes good. The meats:  lucky filet wrapped in bacon was our first try. Filet was good but bacon was all fat.  Lamb and their signature sirloin for both tough and tough to cut / chew.  We stuck with Filet which was very good but all their meats are on salty side.  Other Brazilian places include seafood or shrimps but not here.  Desert is not included either.  Good thing we went for lunch and not dinner prices.  I won't be returning, for $33 I can have a much better steak and frites meal at our favorite restaurant on the strip.",

My table mates sung praises, but all I can truly say is the parmigiana crusted chicken was excellent. So full after all the food that I just couldn't partake in the desserts offered, as tasty as they looked. After dinner drink? Yes please! The South African liquor is a must try.

Flip that button to green for go and the men with their big meat sticks and long swords will not leave you alone. You want something? You got it! I could get used to this...  The salad bar does not disappoint either. Clean as can be... none of this one dish spilling into another nastiness and stuff sitting out where you're wondering whether it's still good or not. They bill themselves as being the steakhouse that even vegetarians will love and I can see why. This is high quality food for a fair price for what you are getting.

It is 50 dollars for all you can eat.  They have a pretty wide variety of side dishes in the buffet to choose from including:  soup, salad, lobster bisque, a variety of deli meats, sushi, greens, veggies, rice, potatoes, cheese, and a whole lot more.  You leave a double sided saucer on your table on either green (meaning you want meat) or red (meaning you are done for the moment eating meat) and servers come around with a variety of meats that they slice for you off of the bone.  Off the top of my head they came around with different sausages, filet mignon, bacon wrapped chicken and steak, pork, flank steak, chicken parm, and a few more.  All of it was absolutely delicious.    The ambience is a lot of fun and it's a great place to come celebrate or start the night out with friends!",

For you sick bastards that eat sushi there is a couple sushi selections for you.  The wine list is pretty nice.  I usually get the sangria because it sneaks up on you!

On top of the Salad bar there's a beautiful floral arrangement. This salad bar is huge! It can be a meal on its own! she told us to pace ourselves so we can save room for meats because we're more than welcome to return back to the salad bar at anytime. I'm glad I listened to her.   The meats were definitely the star of the show! The top sirloin the house special. Was my favorite! It melts in your mouth. The beef ribs are also a must try! Every cut that we had was cooked to perfection! You can request through your server if you want more of a certain meat!   Desserts! So many to choose from. our server came over with an assortment tray of desserts and described each one so beautifully! I wanted them all! We ended up getting the creme brulee!

We went around 5:30p and we had a reservation. We waited about 10 minutes and we were seated. The staff is really nice and our cups were always filled.   Pricing is $49.99 per head. And $24.99 for salad area only. I wouldn't recommend that being that it's an all you can eat meat place. They do offer military discount. The meats were all amazing and they kept bringing meats to your table unless you flipped your card to red. Each table will have a double sided green/red card.   The restaurant is big and spacious so you're not too close to everyone. The staff definitely keep bringing you food so charge your card if you don't want meat. I can't even list all the meats that they had. There salad bar was nice too! Pace yourself...  If you're in the area go check them out. You won't regret it. Don't eat anything to prepare yourself :)",

    "text": "Came here to try it out since we saw there was a location in Irvine, and since we were in Vegas, we decided to see how it was.  We didn't have reservations, and decided to come here at 4pm right when dinner starts to avoid the crowd.  The meat here was good, and not as salty as Fogo.  The service was excellent because we let our server know that we wanted a particular kind of meat, and it came by quickly.  The beef rib and the picante were the best.  My friends had the lamb and lamb chop, and the lamb chop was over cooked.  We stuff to the beef.  More choices came out as we were finished with our meal.  Also, the salad and hot bar station had some interesting stuff like lobster bisque and some kind of Brazilian fish stew, etc.  The cheese balls suck because it was dense even when it was hot.  They give you complimentary garlic mash potatoes and plantains.   Parking is abundant.  Make sure you go early so you don't have to wait long.  Will try the Irvine location later to compare.",

    "text": "I made reservations on Open Table for 6:30PM.   We checked in at 6:20PM and were told by the female Maitre D' we would be seated momentarily.  This was one of many lies that young lady would tell.  After standing around for 25 minutes I went to check on what was going on.  She seemed annoyed that i was bothering her.  She quickly said there were several others ahead of me and that my party would be coming up soon.  We were finally called at 7:20 and could have walked in without a reservation and got in at the same time.  the people behind me who got in at the same time as me did just that.    So I was willing to accept that the food would be worth the wait.  I had heard nothing but good things about this place and the reviews were positive.  I will say the salad bar was nice and they had allot of things to choose from.  The meat was OK and not as good as i had expected.  From overcooked to just bland was the theme.  The lamb was the only thing that stood out as being special.       The service was slow and we waited for everything from the Waiter.  The Servers carrying the meat were nice but they became scarce after the first go around and we had to call them over several times to get the items we liked.  For what you pay to eat here you truly do not get your moneys worth.  I was not impressed and will not return.  They don't care about customer service or quality just get them in and get them out!  This by far was the worst meal of 2016!!!",

I went to the bar for a drink and it was mostly empty there I know why it was like pulling teeth to get service. I waited over 15 minutes for one of  the three bartenders to poor a glass of wine.   Our waiter was the only saving grace to this poor service experience. He was actually very good and prompt and extremely apologetic for the the service we had receive prior to his arrival. The food was good plenty of items on buffet/salad bar area. The food was fresh and constantly being put out and well displayed. The Brazilian BBQ was good with lots of meats always coming around. I'd say the leg of lamb was the best on the menu. Dessert was goods the chocolate cake was very well done. I was wasn't a fan of the cheesecake it was way too sweet. I would have given this place a solid 4 stars if the hostess and bar service would have not been so poor.",

Please be sure that you make reservations or you will be waiting for quite some time. This is no fault of TdB. The restaurant is absolutely beautiful inside. They have a full buffet if you are a vegetarian, but are dining with omini's. The food was extremely delicious from the buffet. From what my kids said the meat was tasty and plentiful. My daughter enjoyed the lobster bisque and my son like the selection on the salad bar. Although I didn't eat any meat the Chimichurri sauce was bomb - had it with the rice and mushroom gravy.Our waiter was a joy and we received a complimentary dessert because of the birthday. I often rate an eatery by the cleanliness of their restroom and their restroom was not only clean it was well appointed. Thank you TdB for making my daughter's birthday a great experience.",

    "text": "We came here with some friends, and this place has something for everyone. And it's so delicious!   If you've never been to a Brazilian steakhouse, here's a quick guide: 1. Sit down and order something to drink 2. Go up to the salad bar as many times as you like 3. Flip your meat card from red to green until you can't eat anymore assortments of meat that are being walked around for you to choose from. 4. Once you can't eat another bite, flip your card to red and order dessert.   If you're not a meat person, they do have the option for someone to just do the salad bar for half the price.  I love this salad bar, it's worth coming here just for that, but I try to pace myself knowing the meats are next. The salad bar has a wide variety of different salads, vegetables, cheeses, sushi, salamis, etc.   Meats from chicken, to pork, to steak, all cooked appropriately. Red meats are from medium to medium rare. Everything tasted wonderful, especially the ones wrapped in bacon.   Please note: this meal could easily last you two days of never wanting to see food again.",

The food is always great,.And the cost to value I feel is worth it. My drinks have always been tasty. The salad bar is phenomenal and if I wasn't such a carnivore I would happily just eat the quinoa salad and frejoles (might have spelled that incorrectly) to my heart's content. Fortunately I do love me some deliciously cooked meat on swords so this place is a win.  Tonight's meal was one of the best we have had there.  Everything was cooked perfectly and seemed to have a hint more flavor to it. Even the lamb chops (i hate lamb) were magical. Heaven on earth.   I also love that this place is semi casual. I mean no one looks slovenly, but if you dress up or not, it's ok. My husband HATES dressing up. So I'm happy to get presentable out of him.  Soo thanks to not having a fancy dress policy.

All kinds of meat, cooked all kinds of ways, and a salad bar with sushi.  My favorites are the house special (I believe it is top sirloin) and the filet mignon.  I am also a huge fan of the Brazilian sausage.  I am also one of those people that will order, like, 6 dishes of sweet fried bananas.  Seriously, that's my favorite 'dessert' even though it's a side.  The past couple of times I've been the service has not been over-the-moon like my first few visits here.  I am not sure if it's just luck of the draw or if they're getting some new faces, but our last server, Marina, barely checked on our table and we had to hunt her down to get specific meats sent to our table.  This is definitely one of my favorite splurge spots in the valley.  While the price is a little steep ($50/person), you are paying for serious quality and (usually) great service.  They also had a VIP Card special this year: you pay $59.99 and receive a punch card with 12 punches.  Each of those punches equals 50% off the normal price, so you save ~$260.  Hopefully they do it again next year.  As much as I'd like to eat here weekly, I'm pretty sure I'd explode in a shower of meat and bananas, so it's a good thing that it's a special occasion spot.",

The meats are roasted perfectly, and there's plenty to go around.  I am a fan of lamb, and when they come out with not only roast leg but also chops, I'm in heaven.

He was extremely knowledgeable, and I appreciated his kindness.  All that aside...the salad bar selection is terrific.  Be prepared to make more than one trip.  Love the smoked salmon!  The steak is plentiful, and if it isn't cooked to your liking, you can make requests and they're back in a flash with your preference.  The house cut is my fav!  I recommend reservations, as this place is always slammed.",

I was debating between this one and fogo de chao but fogo couldn't even compete. From the mash potatoes to the plantains to the meats, everything is perfectly seasoned. I would say save your money from the las vegas buffets and take an uber to Texas De Brazil. You'll love it!",

Nice bar area and excellent, attentive service from start to finish.  Diners of all ages from 2-60+ dressed in shorts to business attire.  This is not a quiet, intimate place, but very cool to impress a date and definitely celebrate.  They were serving 15 different meats, including sirloin, pork, sausage and chicken (I'm forgetting a few).  They will keep it coming, so remember to use your meat tabs (green for more, red to pass).  The meat is tender and seasoned perfect.  If you want it well, they are happy to oblige and they take requests.  The salad bar has a vast assortment of items to please every palate.  Salads, cheese, meats, fruit...a good variety.  They had lobster bisque (very rich and creamy) and some excellent au gratin potatoes.  They serve each table mashed potatoes and fried bananas.  I saw the desert selections.  Though we did not partake, they looked amazing.  How do you leave?  Stuffed!!  I suggest reservations because it gets busy.  Dinner is $49.99 a person.  $24.99 for salad bar only.  $5 for kids under 6 and 1/2 price 6-12 year olds.  They honor military, law enforcement and teachers with 20% off (have your ID with you).  Enjoy this gem of a dining experience.",

I don't eat a lot of meat, so I wasn't sure if this would be an experience worth my money, but let me tell you, it was worth every cent. Their meat practically melts in your mouth; it is so tender and juicy. Their salad bar is just as amazing. I was impressed that they had tabbouleh salad as I do not see that at salad bars often. The service was perfect. The waiter never let our drinks get empty, and he checked on us often but not so often that it became annoying. If you love meat, this place is like meat heaven!",

    "text": "Sorry but this place SUCKS. I've been here 2 times and both visits have disappointed us. Went here on 12/26/2015 for a late Christmas celebration. We go to the buffet area and it just lacks in quality and selection. It is literally a salad bar. If you've ever been to Tucanos Brazilian steakhouse you would know that their buffet has a wide variety. Tucano's has salad, sushi, bread, pastas, and fruit. Texas de brazil just has lettuce and bacon. Then the meat that they served just SUCKED. They barely brought us any steaks! They mostly brought around the lamb, chicken, and sausage...SAUSAGE?! I mean really?! $50 per head and they give me sausage...wtfreak. The steak that they did bring around was either salty or tasted like armpits (or at least what I imagined what it would taste like). Now here's the real kicker...during weekends your meal is supposed to include drink refills and dessert. YES, dessert is included. Did the waitress mention this? NO!!! She straight up left the check on our table and said have a good day!!! Wtheck right?! So we asked if the dessert came with the meal just to make sure and she said yes. Just blows my mind that we have to even ask! Another big problem was the wait. We got there at 1 and didn't leave till 4!! Not because the food was great but because it was so SLOW! Even after we asked to see the dessert menu the waitress went to the table behind us and showed them first! Once we got our order in it literally took 30 mins to get it! Another thing that annoyed me was their bathroom. Can somebody explain to me why a place like this can't fix their restrooms? The doors DID NOT lock!! There was NO toilet seat covers! One sink was broken, the other had no soap, and only one sink worked! Sorry but this place is one big scam! I'd rather spend my money at a casino buffet!",

Heck no!  They got us seated in less than 5!  They explained to us how it works there for the food and we were off!  Let me tell you, their quinoa salad and tabulah-I'm probably spelling that wrong- was SO GOOD!!  I also had their lobster bisque, a few crackers with the AMAZING goat cheese, and oh my!! Their cheese filled bread!!  To die for!  They also served us their garlic mashed potatoes and sweet fried bananas.  Yummo!!!  As far as their meats, I had their flank steak and the bacon wrapped filet mignon.  My son and husband had a lot more of their meat than I did and they enjoyed it all!  We can't wait to go back!",

Made the mistake of leaving a very expensive pair of sunglasses on the table. Let me add that they were in the center of table kinda tucked under the edge of my plate. My husband couldnt even see them. Due to how dark the glasses, table and lighting of the restaurant.I didnt even get out of the parking lot when I realized I didnt have them. I was gone less than 5 minutes. Went back in and the table wasnt even completely bused but the glases were gone. Their security footage shows that after we left the only people that went to the table were the server and the busperson. Corporate Risk management stated that they are not responsible for items left in their restaurant when you leave the table. So from now on I shall be dining at Fogo de Chao because I refuse to dine with thieves!",

My only complaint is that the food is soooooo good I tend to make myself sick over-eating.  The staff are always friendly and professional.  The atmosphere is very nice (we've made the mistake of coming in wearing tee-shirts; nobody said anything, but I just felt a little under-dressed.  So I make sure to at least wear a decent shirt.)  One helpful tip - be careful of the Lobster Bisque.  The very first time we ate there, I had A LOT of it, as it was so creamy and delicious.  I paid for it later that night.  Now, normally if I had problems of that type, I probably wouldn't go back.  But that just goes to show how much we loved the place.  Upon return visits I just went easy on the Bisque, and no problems.  A few Vegas visits back we were comp'ed 2 dinners to a Brazilian BBQ in Planet Hollywood.  It was terrible.  So stick with the good stuff.  Reservations are a good idea, as they can get busy right when the open the doors (for dinner; don't know about weekend lunch).",

Every time has been very pleasant and have always left happy and full.    The salad bar has a great selection of sides ranging from seasoned cheeses to smoke salmon. It's always hard not to go a little overboard on the salad bar since they offer a great variety. Soups have always been good and they always offer between 4-5 kinds. On to the meats.    If you are looking for a specific meat your waiter/waitress will ask if there is a meat your looking for. Just let them know and eventually one of the servers will come by. If you are a fast eater just let the servers know you would like another serving. Serving size seems small but you have to remember you are being served pork, chicken, beef, and lamb. I've always been happy with the meats they served, never finding them too salty and they have never arrived dry.    If the price for dinner is too much for you I suggest trying them during lunch (look at the website to see when they are open for lunch). Definitely not as busy compared to dinner time and they seem to offer the same meats. I think it's great they are open for lunch because afterwards a walk( or waddle) to town square is needed after such a great big meal.",

Addam was great.  Dining out with me  includes getting to know the waiter.  Like with  Peter we found that Addam is another fellow No Californian speaking Brazilian Portuguese.  Joking around throughout the 3 hours there makes it a very enjoyable dinner.  Keep those drinks coming as I warned my wife going to dollar dance and we'll get him in with a percentage.   As he asked me to critique the flan since i had flan Cuba, Venezuela, Colombia, Spain I told him was a little firmer than the others but I still liked it.  He said how about the carmelize raw sugar from Brazil, my reply bring out the Brazilian dancers and that'll really sweeten the dessert.  He and his other female co-workers just started busting up. Peter came by chat a bit and it's like a big family atmosphere here. Yes, the food is 5+ stars, service is 5+ also but to get that + it's the staff and all of them throughout is 10+.",

But now that i have a rambunctious 1 year old that can't sit still and climbs out of his high chair every second he gets a chance, it makes it so hard to enjoy a meal.   So I decided to try take out.  I ordered a pound of garlic  picanha & a pound of the flank steak.    I was highly disappointed.  Both cuts of meat tasted so bland, no flavor just the beefy taste.  Not at all like what they should taste like when you dine in.  For $18 dollars a pound i could have grilled up some steak on my grill at home and probably get a better result.    So disappointed!",

Don't judge, but I did decide to break the diet here and have a taste of their various meat. How can you not give in when the meat surrounds your perimeter and their luring scent dances around you seducing you to take a bite? No regrets were felt and I'd gladly do it again.   Oh and the salad bar was AMAZING. I could not get enough of their couscous. Everything was amazing. Be cautious of all the free cheesy bread, cinnamon and sugar banana, and garlic mashed potato. All that starchy goodness could impose on the amount you eat. Get your money's worth and try out some dessert. We had the caramel layered cheesecake. I guarantee you'll fall in love.",

The part that was not good was the corporate policy and the inability of the manager to make things better.  We were given a gift card to celebrate here.  We also qualified for a \"heroes \" discount for my wife being a teacher.  At time to pay the bill we were told that we could not use a discount they advertise and the gift card that was given to us, that someone paid for.  The explanation from the manager was that it was a corporate policy.  I kindly asked for the corporate number or regional manager information rather than try to make things right, he said there is nothing he can do.  I told him to take off the discount that his company deems warranted for teachers and use the gift card someone bought already and that we would not bring outer business back.  He simply tells me okay and does it.  It is a shame because it could have been a special place to celebrate birthdays and anniversaries and other special events.  It is a shame when corporate decisions cost your business customers for the long term.",

She has been vomiting every hour or so since midnight. I ate mostly from the cooked meat selections and I am fine but she is VERY sick. Think twice about eating anything there that is with cream/mayonnaise (potato salad, lobster bisque, etc.) I would stick with vegetables and meat only. This is no reflection on then wait staff (our waitress Paula for instance is awesome). VERY disappointed, we won't be returning.  Update #1: I called the restaurant on 4/6/17 and spoke to the general manager. He was 100% unfazed that we are VIP card carrying customers nor that we are regular customers. They are going to \"conduct an internal investigation\" and they have refused any sort of compensation for our $100+ dinner.  Great way to treat loyal customers, don't you think?  Update #2: My wife is running a temperature of 101 now.  Update #3: \"Tim\" (no last name) from Texas De Brazil's corporate office called me and said because no one else has reported an illness yet, this is an isolated incident and oh, yeah, I hope your wife feels better.",

    "text": "Ok, so I have to say that Texas de Brazil have an awesome salad bar. They also have a good rodizio, yet it has a spicy cost. One of the things I like about Texas de Brazil is their picanha, but I don't like how you have to get the all you can eat \"rodizio\" to eat it. So, there are other places in town where you can get a certain type of meat, or plate a la cart! However, this is not the case of Texas de Brazil so it loses one start for it.  Another concern I have is in regards to their caipirinha! I'm sorry Texas de Brazil, but you have to step up and start using real sugar to make caipirinhas. As a Brazilian who goes constantly to steakhouses in Las Vegas (every week), I have to say that their caipirinha really sucks! It hurts me having to say that, but it's True. So it loses another star for claiming that they are making Caipirinhas correctly, while using fake sugar syrup to craft them. I even asked the server to use real sugar, but my request was denied and the drinks tasted weird and fake. Not to say that they still charged me for that so I have to take one star for it.  Alright, so besides the lack of options for dining and the bad caipirinhas Texas de Brazil has a beautiful dining room and lots of space for you to bring your whole family! Just remember to not bring your 100 years old grandma to eat there unless you want her to have a heart attack. As there's not an option for ala cart, you must be aware that every time you go there, you will end up spending at least 70 dollars per person with taxes and tip.  Texas de Brazil is used to having lots of tourists, so I feel like they left the locals behind and this is the reason why I have to rate it accordingly to my experience. I'm a local, and I will be updating my review as they improve. If they start to make Caipirinhas with real sugar and add some new options other than rodizio on your menu, then I'm willing to increase their rating.  Finally, my review is based on their competition, which have constantly been taking customers input and improving their menu, deals and drinks. So, nothing more fare than expecting the same from Texas de Brazil right? If they really care about their locals like me, then eventually they will reach out to me and listen to what me and others have to say regarding their menu and Caipirinhas. This is an important topic as Caipirinhas are our national Drinks and it should be made correctly. Cheating out on sugar won't help you improve our experience and their ratings.  Hence, I hope you find this review helpful as I have addressed the pros and cons of this large Brazilian steakhouse. If you are looking for an alternative restaurant where you can get ala cart items at a very discounted price, then you can try Via Brazil steakhouse that offers ala cart options, happy hour deals at a fraction of the regular price and real Caipirinhas (crafted with real sugar and lots of limes). Let me know what you think about those differences I've addressed.",

    "text": "So I write this with great disdain as For several years Texas de Brazil has been a place for birthday celebrations , company dinners and just casual dining because it's my favorite restaurant in all of LAS vegas.   Last night we had a party of 6 and we are all regulars here.   Someone in the kitchen went way too heavy with the salt. All of the sides were OVERLY SALTED. my brother is a well to do chef in Las Vegas and I a chef in my own right. He is a lover of salt and me I like my salt just right and even he The Salt king said wow way too salty. The cous cous , the Brazilian bread balls everything but the meat.   The meat which is usually seasoned so amazingly well went like this salty exterior and unseasoned on the inside. Usually it's a good balance of it all.   Our server tho very sweet was not as attentive as we would like but we didn't get mad because we saw he had a huge section of tables to cover and in no sequence he was all over the restaurant.   Why not give servers a specific section so they can maintain our waters. The food was so salty we were dying of thirst. I mean lord. I've never been so unwilling to fork out over $400 at Texas de Brazil hell I've spent well over $2k there for our company.   Get it together we don't pay a good amount of money to have someone in YOUR KITCHEN who does not know what they are doing. I mean even the Lobster Bisque was inedible because of the levels of salt.",

    "text": "Located in town-square, this is a pretty easy restaurant to spot, as it faces the street.  We bought our gift cards from Costco, you save 20% or $20 off the bill.    Regularly, $100 for 2 people to dine here.  If you're not familiar with churrascaria, the meats are either cooked over coals, barbecue, or could even be roasted.    I found out that they're really into soy bean oil and that goes for both their salad bar and their meats.  If you're allergic to soy, they'll run through the selection for you, but I wish they had it on the menu or something.    Based on your preference really, you can decide on which cuts of meat you think is the best of them all.  The all-you-can-eat meat comes to you, rather having to cook it yourself or plate it yourself.  The leg of lamb along with the lamb chops were great and the top choice was the Brazilian Picanha.  The braised beef ribs and pork ribs were way over seasoned with salt.  Aside from it all, nothing else worth mentioning in my book.   As for the salad bar, the roasted beets, thin hearts of palms and tabbouleh were the ones I went back for seconds.    Service was hit or miss.  We had to ask for lamb chops and the ribs 2-3 times before they decided to make one round in our area.  And when the ribs did come by, they keep passing us by and gesture they'll be back.  The server at the table is nice, cordial, but he can only do so much.    The appetizer bananas was completely covered in sugar and baked, not torched to brown the sugar.  Already pre-made, I couldn't get one without the sugar.  I did expect a little more from my experience, which was not overly salted meat, but that's what we got.    3 stars and I definitely did not stuff myself.  If you want the experience, try going for their cheaper lunch option and still get the same type of food.",

Laid out slightly different than other locations yet somehow familiar, the salad bar displays the usuals and is very briefly visited by me as I know the routine already; meat, meat, and more meat.  All of the meat was cooked to perfection as always; as I said, almost impossible to beat.  The service was excellent especially as some staff stayed late since our group didn't get there until 9~PM, an hour before they closed (due to our tradeshow). They were patient and kind, especially with a group of unruly drunkards, just what the doctor ordered after a terribly long day.  It further solidifies that I would never hesitate to visit any one of these establishments.",

    "text": "We tend to come here in special occasions since the price tag is a bit hefty at $50 a person. Kids who are 5-12 years are half price. They have a great selection of various items at their \"salad bar\" area, my favorite being the spicy California rolls, lobster bisque soup and marinated mushrooms. Once you are ready for your share of endless meat, simply flip your TDB card for your place setting over to green and you're off!  The meat guys come to your table with choices ranging from flank steak, house sirloin, garlic sirloin, chicken wrapped bacon, lamb chops, leg of lamb, etc. The waiter will also bring you the basic table staples of mashed potatoes, cheddar rolls and fried bananas. The cheddar rolls are not to be skipped, I could literally eat the whole basket, they are amazing! Iced tea and water are included in our dinner price, however any other beverage is additional in cost. If you desire a soda, keep in mind it will not be a fountain beverage. They will bring you a cup of ice and a canned soda, and refills are not complimentary. If you happen to save room for a dessert, they do have a few to choose from. Can't say I have ever made it to the dessert portion of the meal after all the meat intake. The only thing I can say I would frown upon is the lack of breathing room between tables. They tend to stack people right on top of each other and you will often be on very close proximity to your neighboring table. This can make navigating a trip to the salad bar a bit more tricky and awkward. I would recommend making an advanced reservation as well since the wait times can sometimes be staggering long. Your whole party will need to be present as well in order to be seated.",

The waiters come around and just cut meat onto your plate and you decide when you've had enough. My favorite was the flank steak, my husband really liked the house special sirloin and the sausage best, and our older son was a big fan of the Parmesan chicken. Our three yr old pretty much just snacked on pineapple and cheese. This place makes me wish I had a bigger stomach because there is just so much to enjoy.

They have lamb, assortment of steaks, chicken, etc. You flip it to red and they stop coming by.  The salad bar is a free for all and has such things as cheesy potatoes, sushi, a bacon bowl, rice, veggies, etc.  If you go hungry, you will leave completely satisfied! Seasoning: PERFECT! You couldn't make it any better. Customer Service: Fast, attentive, great knowledge of everything from taste to procedure Ambiance: A bit packed but comfortable and you get a family feel  GET THE PICHANA! You will not regret it. Filet mignon is good, they have regular and garlic...love the garlic one. The sausage is pretty good. The flank is nice as well, but that pichana is LIFE!",

Definitely try the bacon from the bar as well as the artichokes and manchego cheese. If you want a yummy bar combination, wrap some of the creamy goat cheese with a thin salty slice of prosciutto.

My friend had made a reservation for 5:30PM and we arrived a little bit earlier and only waited for about 5 minutes. Since it was my first time here, Wesley took the time to explain to me how everything works. You have a small double-sided card that is colored red on one side and green on the other. Red means no more meats, green means give me more. The meat servers are constantly walking around checking each table.  There is also a salad bar which consist of their daily soup, which was lobster bisque that night, a ton of sides, and a giant cheese wheel of grand padano (my favorite cheese :D) they also had some dried meats like salami and prosciutto.  Now for the meats! They are generally served medium rare but if you have a preference you can just tell them and they will make it for you. My favorite had to be the beef ribs. Pretty much anything that was beef lol. I couldn't remember the specific names of the other meats but the beef rib was very memorable Oh my gosh it literally melted in my mouth, I think I was like drooling oil from it lol. I also really enjoyed the sausage and parmesan crusted chicken! Everything was just so delicious. Also, they give you some cheese-filled bread balls, garlic mashed potatoes and fried plantains to clean your palate so you can taste everything better. I think I was the only one among our group who destroyed those garlic mashed potatoes.  I'm definitely coming back here!",

Starting from the beginning of our dinner until the end, the waiters and meat carvers were professional and courteous. Whenever we requested for anything they always followed through. There wasn't a single instance where we asked for a meat to come and it didn't come. We also had special requests such as rare filet mignon or rare lamb and it always came!  As for their food, the meats were cooked to perfection! Their cuts were always juicy and flavorful. My personal favorite was the house social and the one that comes on a big plate. My friends really enjoyed their rare filet mignon. The salad bar was well stocked with both warm foods and cold salads. I fell in love with their potatoes au gratin. The mushrooms were really good to and you can use the sauce to dip the meat in for extra burst of flavor.",

I've been to other Brazilian churrascarias and this one ranks as the best one. The wait staff was amazing, prices were reasonable, and most of all the food was delicious. Every meat I tried was great with my favorite being the garlic sirloin. My husbands favorite was the bacon wrapped chicken. The dessert menu looked so great that we each got our own instead of sharing like we usually do. I had a super moist and decadent chocolate cake and he had the bananas foster pie.

Just mention this before you get your bill this saved us 20$ on our bill!   I'll definitely be back next time I'm in vegas.

We should have called a lot earlier. She couldn't take reservations over the phone until we were physically there. So we went anyway and when we arrived it definitely was an hour and a half... so we decided to see if the bar had food and although it was limited we ended up ordering all 4 items on the bar menu (two meat dishes, a cheese plate, and soup) and a couple drinks. Food was limited but it was very tasty, fast and we ended up only spending $65 for the 4 items on appetizer menu, bread, and two drinks (cuba libre and a mama mango). It was plenty of food for us and we felt like we got a great deal. The basketball game was on so that was even better.  There was a guy bartender and two lady bartenders-- all did a great job. The people waiting around us all seemed happy too.  I wish they had one in Summerlin but next time I go to Texas Dr Brazil I'll be sure to make reservations beforehand!",

The wait was about an hour so we hung out in the bar and had some drinks.  The bartender that night was *extremely* generous with his pours.  I'm not much of a drinker and I was soused after 2 drinks.    Pro tip: If you go to Sam's Club they have a $100 gift card for this place for only $80 bucks.  They have a pretty sweet military discount of 20% off as well so we ended up eating here for like $66.  DEAL!   After you're seated and order your drinks you're invited to partake in the salad bar.  This ain't no ordinary salad bar...there are many tempting options such as charcuterie meats and cheeses, salads, olives, grilled pineapples, fresh parmesean cheese, sushi, smoked salmon, asparagus, black beans, rice, lobster bisque, cheesy potatoes, mushrooms, and much, much, more.  It's really temping but don't fill up because....  ...After you sit down and flip your card over to green the rodizio guys will start parading their meat around for you.  They have lamb, chicken, pork, and every cut of beef that you can think of at any done-ness level.  My personal favorite is the beef ribs...good lord...they are fall-off-the-bone tender.    I've never had dessert here because I usually gorge myself but I'm sure they're delicious.    This place is worth every penny.  It just doesn't get any better than this.",

The salad bar was so much more than a salad bar and had a plethora of delectable salad toppings, and even their popular lobster bisque, which is not my fav but people rave about. Spend the $60 and get the discount card. It will be worthy it in the end since you get like, 10 dinners at half price Worth checking it out, but I think you can only purchase them in the actual restaurant.   Property is stunning inside and out. The hustle of all the workers running about is all part of the experience. Offering all the different types of meats available. Great place! Will definitely return!",

Talk about excellent service. I dont even recall a time I had to wait for my food. Whatever I wanted he made sure it got me quick. Quality food served right out the grill but watch out. Eventually it will get too salty. U need to pace yourself and def be picky to what u want to eat because they will all come to u. Again thank Mario for an awesome experience",

Not only that is insulting to a veteran to not accept his card that they got as a gift but to lie to them in their face, is very bad business practice.",

    "text": "First buffet ever tried upon visiting Vegas. All I can say is excellent service, food, and experience. The wait time is about 30 minutes for dinner. The wait was so worth it.   After getting seated the waiter introduced himself and explained how the buffet worked. We flip the circle sign green for meat and red to stop. Plus stop by at the extravagant salad bar for much more than just vegetables. There's sushi, shrimp, smoked salmon, varieties of sliced deli meat...etc.  The meat came flying by at a rapid rate. It was meat overload where you wanted to try every cut of meat. The waiter was nice enough to give us an extra plate to hold the meat we could not put on our plates.   If we missed one of the meats or wanted more of something our waiter was kind enough to ask the kitchen staff to send a fresh skewer our way. If you wanted the meat with less salt or cooked a certain way, they are more than happy to do so.   Let's just say we were too full for dessert, but the plantain dish was an excellent addition to the meal.   Highly recommend this place for a hearty and meaty meal.",

This was our first time visiting Texas de Brazil, birthday weekend so I was on vacation.   I don't remember the waiters name but he was pretty cool. The cowboys though, theyre the ones doing the real work in these joints. Meat is brought around in large chunks and sliced off for you to grab fresh off the cow. I thought I took pictures but I did a lot this day and so guess not.   This place beats the competition, I will be coming back to this establishment now instead.",

They have quite the selection at their salad bar, including grilled Provolone, shrimp ceviche, black beans and rice, and fish moqueca. The fish moqueca was amazing! The coconut milk made it taste like one of my mom's Thai curries, it was so delicious. I wanted to eat more but knew I had to pace myself for the stars of the show, the churrasca!  All the meats were delicious! They also had bacon wrapped jalapenos and sweet bananas that left a melted sugary goodness at the bottom of the plate that I wanted to lick clean! Can't wait to come back!",

About 10min later they came up with an alternative but that should have been the immediate response.

Well what's not to like here, they have every kind of meat, beef, pork, chicken, veal, lamb and so on, the salad bar is as big as some people's home and let's not get into the wine room which I'm sure has 2M of wine in there. I don't see how you can't give this place a 5 star, you know the price before you agree to the service so if you can't afford it or don't want to dirks money on quality food get your cheap ass up and make room for those that appreciate the finer things in life!   It's like $50 a person but do what, are you not worth it? All You can eat filet mignon, that's worth $100 alone. Yes o can say things like I wish they had bearnaise sauce but it's not what they do, and I know this going in. It's not Burger King you can't always have it your way, try it their way, you might like it, I love it!  I will be coming here for another 10 years I can see why it would ever change.   Our server was a young man new to Vegas (like 6 months) from Pittsburgh name Ryan, try to get him he's very attentive.  There's always a line and a wait so if you can book your spot online, I use open table and if your a party of two, I recommend table 11 or 15, it's right at the exit from the kitchen so the meat carvers have to pass you first!  When my friends come into town and ask where to go, I send them here and I tell them, if you don't like it I will pay for it, nobody has taken me up on the offer.",

    "text": "I don't usually do reviews ever but I gotta say. I went there last night to celebrate a friends birthday party of ten and it was very underwhelming. They only came around with two to three kinds of meats and every serving cut was deep dark red. Now I'm a fan if medium rare to rare but this was enough for me to not eat what was given.   The possibility of the meats being smaller of variety due to the time we had come in (20:30 - 22:00) but it's hard to judge.  The staff was good and they did well to accommodate for the amount of people we had and the fact it was their birthday. I applaude to them for their work as always.   My biggest complaint is just the lack of food provided and the quality of the food provided. I enjoyed the one slice of cake I ordered just as much as the one time they came around with lamb as we arrived.   The place is alright but surely don't want to risk another pricey attempt to finding better success the next time around.",

Their salad bar has good options for sides, the mashed potatoes and banana dish to serve are so amazing. I'm big on customer service and they are always overly accommodating and welcoming, one of the main reasons I always return. Obviously because of price, it is definitely a place I save for special occassions. But I have never had an issue with the food. Every meat I've had is perfectly cooked and seasoned, it's an easy place to overeat",

The thing that really set this apart was the variety of meats being brought around. Just when u thought the selection was done something else would come around. To top out the experience, the staff were beyond attentive, my water glass never below 50%, the waiter constantly checking to see if we needed anything, and The promptness with which a request was fulfilled was delightful.",

It's accommodating that it's $50 bucks a person but all the sizzling meat (sirloin, prime, chicken, medium rare, rare) it's so worth it!   The minute I walked in the hostess was really friendly and I liked how she sparked up a conversation. The setting looked really nice and fancy. Interior felt like a Brazilian getaway vacation. The waiters and waitresses were all sharp buttoned up flannels and all. The waitress quickly greeted us saying there are more than 60 choices in the salad buffet and did I mention that they have shrimp and salmon in the salad bar? Yes I said it!  The minute you've stepped in here you can smell the marinated steak turning in the kitchen. The meat just melts in your mouth and seasoned just the way I like it. Definitely bringing my appetite back!",

Reservations are highly recommended. They have a plentiful salad bar with fresh cold meats, cheeses, olives, and salads for you to enjoy. They also serve hot items on the salad bar, including lobster bisque which is amazing and au gratin potatoes which are to die for. They are creamy and cheesy, and I prefer these over any of the hot sides they bring to the table. Hot sides usually consist of mashed potatoes, fried bananas and cheese bread.  The main star of the show is of course the meats. I love all the meats they have to offer. My favorite is the garlic Picanha. It is so flavorful. I also like the filet mignon. You can choose how done you want the meat too, anywhere from mooing, all the way to well done. Other meats they have are parmesan chicken and pork, bacon wrapped filet mignon, brazilian sausage, leg of lamb, beef and pork ribs, and flank steak. I found a few of the meats were a bit too salty, so I ended up drinking A LOT of water. Make sure to grab some Brazilian vinaigrette and Chimichurri at the salad bar. Both of these sauces complement the meats excellently. The service is always amazing. I can't say enough good things about this place.",

Unfortunately there is no menu so I wasnt prepared for the bill that came. $50/person. Sodas are $4/each. Alcoholic drinks are outrageous.

The variety of meats they offer varies from pork, steaks, chicken and lamb.   We were able to experience so many types of meats, cuts and flavors. The filet mignon was extremely tender, lamb chops with mint sauce full of flavor, bacon wrapped chicken definite delight, pork sausage cooked just right and the variety of extra sides at the salad bar was an overload of goodness.   Our server Amanda was amazing as well. She was attentive, personable and when we requested a certain meat she was quick to have it sent to our table. She was so polite, for instance she would ask permission to pour more sangria instead of just assuming we wanted more. She also used a splashguard while pouring. Now I know that's a standard in most restaurants but not followed all the time. Her recommendations were well taken.  Favorites: lamb chops, shrimp salad and filet.",

    "text": "Why go:   Because you love amazing Brazilian BBQ and aren't afraid to pay for it.    What did I put in my mouth: While there was great variety in the meats and cuts, I enjoyed the house special, Picanha, and Garlic Picanha.  The Alcatra was on par as well.  Sides are buffet style such as sauteed mushrooms, lobster bisque, salad bar, or jasmine rice.  Complimentary garlic mashed potatoes and cheese bread was equally tasty and welcome.  If it wasn't for Aria's buffet that we ate 6 hours earlier, I'm sure we would have put more of the meat down.    What did it cost: It's not Hometown Buffet so expect to pay some $$.  It was around $50 mark but for the quality and quantity of food, it is well worth it.  Play hard, eat hard.    How was the service: Lola was on point.  A hallmark of any good server is water never dips below half for too long and we are checked on if we are enjoying ourselves.  The servers with the meat skewers were fast to the table and variety abounds.    This is one of those places that I say I would go to more if it were closer but that's all BS.  It's a special little spot that is reserved when I can make it to Vegas because it's not in California.  I love Fogo, but this place edges it out.  While the buffets in Vegas are great, there's really nothing quite like exceptional Rodizio.....trust me when I say you won't disappointed....",

If you are in vegas you owe it to yourself to visit this place, be sure to come hungry because they truly don't stop bringing the flavor until you ask them to stop. A cut above in freshness and variety to satisfy anyone. Deserts are on par as well all around flavor explosion defiantly would recomend. I would suggest reservations as you can make them online as this place stays quite busy",

The major downside of being a large party was sub par service we received.   While some of the room had exceptional service throughout the night. My experience was far from it. Every drink I ordered took about 15 mins to come out and I had to ask to for my water to be refilled. We also didn't get to have nearly as many meats come around nor did anyone explain to us that we could request specific cuts to come around. There also was supposed to be strict drink ordering options of wine, beer or wells, but other tables were offered anything they wanted. At least keep it uniform across the whole room.   As for the food I was only able to dine at the salad bar being a pescatarian, but there were quite a few decent options. I enjoyed the Cesar salad, smoked salmon, goat cheese and the roasted mushrooms.   Overall I thought this place was just alright. I don't think I'd come back to spend my own money, especially with the level of service.",

We tested the restaurant and put a reservation in on Open Table at about an hour into the wait.   After making a huge stink, we were accommodated to a table, but the catch was we were the LAST party that was in the front of the restaurant.  The most disgusting observation was that the restaurant wasn't full and there were empty tables in the dinning area.  Reservations or you'll never get seated!!",

The bacon wrapped chicken, sirloin, filet, bacon wrapped filet, Parmesan chicken, and the beef tri tip were sooo good! But let's talk Brazilian sausage. THAT was the highlight. I think I had at least 4 haha.  For desert since I can't do gluten or dairy I opted for extra plantains. Covered in sugar and cinnamon they were absolute perfection!

The salad bar was kind of disappointing and they don't have as many you my options as they did during my last visit. The cheesy type potatoes on the far wall were delicious and the sushi wasn't bad. It said it was spicy crab but it wasn't spicy at all.   When you're ready for meat, flip the little card to green. When you're full, flip it to red and they will stop coming to your table. Super simple! The filet mignon was my favorite and had the best flavor. It was salty but I liked it because it gave it so much flavor. My favorite thing at dinner was the little rolls they bring out. I forgot all about them until I saw the little basket. They are still my favorite after all of these years. The mashed potatoes and banana they bring out are also delicious. I wait until the end of dinner to eat some of the banana because it's super sweet.   If there's something you're looking for but the guys aren't bringing it to your table, ask. They usually ask you but just in case, you can request items to come to your table.",

From the lobby to the bathrooms you can tell the style was handpicked and crafted to demonstrate simplicity with up class modern art. The lobby chairs look like reused airplane panels with leather upholstery. The staff was very attentive when we arrived folding napkins every time we left the table and replacing our plates with fresh ones ever so often.   The food was displayed beautifully! The salad bar had salads, meat, cheeses - which I love! But they also had potatoes, mushrooms, salmon - that my family liked. They offer military discounts as well, which my parents really like! #supportourtroops!  They had a special going on this month that had stuffed jalapenos wrapped in bacon - yum! The meats rotate but you really have to ask for something if it's not coming out. I had to do that with filet mignon but it still took 30 minutes to come out... They were busy though with a lot of other peoples request and we still had other rotating meats and a great view of the wine collection to occupy us.  I would definitely come back to this location when I'm out in Vegas.",

I have not been to another Brazilian steakhouse to compare this to but I'm afraid if I do I'll be disappointed from comparing it to this place. My favorite is the braised beef ribs. Also get the lobster bisque and have them put fresh black pepper on it and dip the cheese bread. Their top sirloin is my second favorite. I also enjoyed their Parmesan chicken it's very juicy. I'm not a big fan of lamb chops but they cook it just right to cook off the gamey flavor.  Their service matches the quality of their food. They are very attentive to you and take care of you. Fake or not they definitely fake it till they make it, these servers deserve respect and a nice tip.",

The menu says Texas de Brazil is a Brazilian-American Churrascaria that combines the cuisines of Southern Brazil with the generous spirit of Texas.   The salad bar here is effing amazing. Probably designed to fill you up to eat less meat, but I could honestly come here fore the salad bar alone. The menu says 50-60 options and I'd have to agree. The grilled provolone is one of my favorites and there's a good amount of savory hot dishes as well.   They give you a round card that you flip to green when you are ready for carvers to bring by some of that steak, lamb, chicken, pork and Brazilian sausage. The bacon wrapped chicken, sausage and garlic sirloin are my faves. The meal also comes with sides of mashes potatoes, sweet fried bananas and cheese rolls. The little cheese rolls are so good! I've never had room for dessert, but there is a dessert menu. The staff is very friendly and professional. Definitely a great spot for a variety of occasions. I'd recommend buying a VIP Dining Card when they are available for a limited time each year so you can save money on visits, just keep in mind they are only redeemable until the expiration date.   HH is Mon-Fri from 4-7pm.",

It was his first time coming here and although we live in Detroit where they have one downtown I do the one in Vegas was going to be better and it definitely was. We ate so much I have never ate as much as I did at a Texas de Brazil like I did at this one. Everything was fresh our waitress was so nice and even the workers who were carrying around the meat make sure to come by and asked us if it was a specific meat we were waiting for! to be honest or highlight of the night and the last thing we ate was the beef rib! It was cooked to Perfection season perfectly and I have never tasted anything like that before. They also were really nice and gave my boyfriend a piece of free cake and it was delicious we thought we were full until they brought that piece of cake out all in all a great experience definitely will we come back that will be the first place we go to!",

One could easily opt to eat only from this tasty feast.  Of course, the full meal deal is amazing. We were at the restaurant for almost 3 hours and the chiefs continually toured the restaurant offering the diners their freshly cooked meats.  Can't describe how perfectly prepared the meal was. And so delicious! We are are already talking about fitting this dining experience back into our lives again!",

We usually love this restaurant not only because of the food also because of the service. However, this time, the service really make me feel so upset. The server--she not even give us her name, I understand this is a very busy weekend, but she is not even would like to give us a smile....she seems unhappy with our table... The way she talks makes us feel not welcome. We usually give 18% tips, but this time, we really dont feel comfortable, so we just gave 15%. When we sign the check with 15% tips, the server was just next to us, and when she saw us sign for 15%, she threw the check on the table... seriously, she threw the check on the table... Our check number is 2187, table 48/1. I wish whoever looking on this can find out what is name of the server and let her know, if we do anything makes her unhappy, I feel sorry. But the way she treat guest, is really rude. And sorry, we will not return anymore. Service is always more important than the food.",

    "text": "This is a very nice restaurant, and my husband and I used to love this place.  We've eaten here at least once a month for years, celebrated birthdays and anniversaries here.  But now we're rethinking this because recently it's gone downhill:   First, you're offering an overpriced tiny bottle of soda and no refills.  Really?  The little bottle isn't even going to get you through the meal, and what's worse, the server actually gave me a glass of soda, then realized she \"made a mistake\" and took it away and gave me the tiny little bottle!  How insulting is that?  You can't spare a glass of Coke?  What was the difference?  You couldn't actually 'measure out' the amount I was \"supposed\" to have if I didn't get the bottle?  You have to take it away and replace it?  If they have it in the bar, why aren't they offering it instead?  Free refills aren't that expensive; I know this for a fact.  Then, our server did a disappearing act - I guess because she figured we didn't order alcohol (we don't drink, but even if we did we wouldn't while out because it's not a good idea to drink and drive), she'd rather pay attention to tables who were repeatedly ordering from the bar-or maybe she was embarrassed because of her \"error\".  (On a side note, we're pretty good tippers, on the high end, regardless of the fact we order non-alcoholic drinks).  So we were ticked off at that-so much so that if we do return I'm not paying for that little bottle ever again.  Soda should always have free refills, regardless of lunch, brunch, or dinner.  I was ignoring that fact before, but this 'mistake' brought it to the forefront of just being wrong.  Then, since there are large parties at dinner they ALWAYS get preference over everyone else.  When the gauchos bring out the meat, they immediately go to the large tables, which means that everyone else has to wait...and wait...and wait.  What should be no more than a 45-minute sitting turns into twice that or longer.  Sure, you can get chicken or lamb if you want it because they'll pass that over for the beef.  (Personally, I'm not paying this price for those.  I hate lamb and can make chicken at home.)  The large parties empty the skewer, and when the gauchos go back into the kitchen, they start again...you guessed it...with the large parties.  The last time we were there we left irritated because it took TWO HOURS just to get three different cuts of meat!  That's ridiculous!  (Now I'm not a big eater, but c'mon!)  Did they ever think of alternating where they go first so that parties of two or four might not have to sit there all night...just waiting?  Let's face it, the larger parties will stay longer anyway, because they're visiting with each other.  Or are they hoping smaller tables will fill up on the salad bar instead?  Also, when you do finally get the meat, all that's available is bloody.  There's no other way to put it.  Some of us like meat that's medium-well.  You might want to cook it just a tad longer; not everyone enjoys raw or medium-rare meat - we don't want blood all over the plate; and if you ask for medium-well that's another hour of waiting - and I'm not paying over $50 to eat at a salad bar (especially since the items never change - it's gotten to the point I pass a lot of it by).  This happened the last three times in a row that we've been there and we've been loyal customers for years, dining at least once a month, but this has gotten worse and it's changing our minds.  No one goes to this restaurant to fill up on the salad bar and leave, otherwise you wouldn't pay the high price.  I'd rather not just sit at a table waiting; I'd like to finish my meal and go.   Since I'm writing a review, I'm also going to add that you might want to rethink your decision about changing the cheese bread.  It used to be light and fluffy - and addictive - and now it's hard, chewy, and flavorless and I just leave it be.",

As I Brazilian born and raised I know well about my people and our churrasco(BBQ)  Texas de Brazil does not disappoint at all! The meat is fantastic! Like really delicious!  I can eat churrasco everyday and not be mad about it lol  Along with the delicious and succulent meats you have a large salad bar with a variety of items to choose from. There's also a hot bar right against the wall with some of the Brazilian staples, feijoada(black bean stew) farofa(yucca flower fried on butter n onions) and some other things including rice and potato au gratin.  The service is fantastic! Perhaps cuz I'm Brazilian and they know me haha jk jk  Service really is on point! And if you're smart like I am I always get there about 30-45 min before my reservation time so I can enjoy a couple 2 or 3 at times 4 caipirinhas!!! It gets my stomach ready for the meat war that's about to start!! So if you're thinking about trying it out, stop thinking about it and GOOOOOOOO! You won't be disappointed! Also keep in mind they have happy hour from M-F from 16:00(4pm) to 18:00(6pm) where you can enjoy delicious caipirinhas for ONLY 5 bucks!!! That's a steal!  Ask for Vivian she makes the very best caipirinhas and she's soooooooo nice!  Te garanto que vc comera o melhor churrasco brasileiro disponivel pra vc! Tranquilo que a comida e uma delicia. Obrigado Texas de Brasil por sempre me oferecer uma excelente experiencia!",

Being a huge fan of Brazilian restaurants, this place was no exception. We drove in from a grueling 7 hour trip in Memorial Day traffic, cranky and starved. We had our fill of fast food and wanted a nice sit down after our long drive. After calling a few places with no luck, I went on Yelp and was able to make reservations for 9PM...perfect!   When we arrived, the kind hostess told us it would be a few minutes so we busied ourselves at the bar. I had a Mango Caipirinha while the co-habby enjoyed a glass of Cabernet. My drink was tart and refreshing and his was nice and smooth...definitely calmed down our nerves while we waited to be seated. The restaurant is elegant with dark wood furnishings and dim lighting.  I have to say the service was impeccable. Thank you Roberto! The last time I received service this impressive was in NYC at Del Frisco Double Eagle Steakhouse and Ruth Chris in downtown SD. Very impressive. And the service did not waver at all. We were taken care of until the very end.   Our favorite cuts of steak were the Garlic Picanha, Lamb Chops, Filet Mignon and Sirloin. So juicy and cooked to perfection with just the right amount of seasoning. What surprised us was how awesome their salad bar was. We tried so hard to ration our stomach space but that lobster bisque, smoked salmon and those addicting cheese rolls said otherwise. I could make a meal with just that!  Parking wasn't bad when we arrived but can get pretty busy on the weekends. It's located in a bustling shopping center so plan accordingly. Highly recommend when you want a satisfying meal and don't want to skimp on service. 5 stars.",

They have extremely good Lobster Bisque soup. The salad bar is a step beyond your normal everyday salad bar. It is upscale offering pineapple carpaccio, smoked salmon, marinated vegetables, olives, a variety of cheeses, cured meats, grape salad, hummus, asparagus, salad, bread and much more. They also have a hot sides bar with mashed potatoes, rice, sweet fried bananas, mushrooms with wine sauce, potatoes au gratin and more.   Once you are done with your salad they will start bringing around grilled meats. They carve them right at your table and it is all you can eat. Some of the meats you can get include pork loin, chicken, lamb chops, lamb roast, Brazilian sausage, bacon wrapped filet, top steak, beef ribs, pork ribs, shrimp flank steak and more. They normally offer a special item each month.   If you managed to save room for dessert, you won't be disappointed. The desserts are delicious!!  The service has always been wonderful.   Words can not describe how good this place is. If you leave here it is definitely your own fault.",

    "text": "Was back in Vegas for CES and was looking for a nearby supercharger and the nav led us to this shopping mall. Since we'd be there for an hour, decided to look for a place to eat. Out of all the restaurants listed, Texas de Brazil looked to be the best option especially since we were hungry.  Arrived and saw a bunch of people waiting for a table. Went to use the restroom and to our surprise, our name was called.   Not new to Brazilian churrascarias, I was excited when we were presented with the red/green coin. Made a quick stop at the salad bar while the waitress was bringing out our drinks. Love the fact that they serve guarana. It's probably been close to 6 years since I've last had it. The salad bar was pretty extensive, even more so than at Fogo de Chao. Grabbed some greens, rice and some cold cuts and headed back to the table to flip the coin over to green.  Shortly after, the waiters started coming by. Had the picanha, bacon wrapped filet, garlic picanha, filet, and the flank. Didn't see all the other meats come by but you can always request something that you want to eat via the waiter/waitress. I did see some people state they didn't get to try certain types of protein, so if you don't see it, ask for it! The picanha and the garlic picanha were awesome. Be warned that the garlic picanha is VERY garlicky so if you aren't into a strong garlic taste do skip it. The flank steak and the filet were also super tender and moist, almost cooked to a perfect medium rare (I do like my beef cooked closer to the rare side).   The pao de queijo was decent (though the second round was better as it was super hot) but the plantains were awesome. We ate 8 plates of it during our meal. Was too stuffed to eat dessert so can't comment on that.  Realized they have a location down in Irvine, CA so I quickly signed up for their eclub. I used to think Fogo de Chao held the title for the best Brazilian churrascaria, but having eaten at Texas de Brazil, the title lands in the hands of Texas de Brazil.",

    "text": "I cannot believe I am just writing a review for this restaurant! I am a fan of Texas de Brazil, and have been for years.  It's a Brazilian churrascaria, a method of serving grilled and flame-broiled meat dating back to the 1800's.  Servers come by with filet mignon, prime rib, lamb, ribs, sausage, chicken, pork, and more beef every few minutes on skewers, and they place some on your plate.  (Or you assist with your personal tongs).  You are given a little token with two sides, one \"red\" to say you've had enough for now.  And one \"green\" to say, \"Sure, bring me some more!\"  You also can avail yourself of the salad bar, which is quite extensive.  Everything from potato salad, to salami, to shrimp, to cheese, and yes, real salad and vegetable items, too, are there.  There is also a hot soup station.  If you want, you can order dessert, if you possibly have more room after that.  The entire meal is around $33 for lunch, excluding tax and gratuity.  At dinner it is more like $63.  Keep in mind that drinks and dessert are not included.  So, though it feels pretty casual, it is a bit of a splurge meal.  I like it here.  The decor is dark and cavernous, but not somber.  You could dress up or down.  The mood is usually upbeat, and service is friendly.  There is a bar, but it's almost an afterthought.  Though they may have some kind of a Happy Hour, you should come for the main course, the churrascaria! My only criticism is that bread on the table can be a bit hard and salty.  And it's quite loud in there, and the chairs are a bit uncomfortable. Sometimes there is also a log jam with the meat arrivals, and other times a lull.  But mostly it's just fine.  Definitely the best of the Brazilian steakhouses here in town.  It's located at Town Square, a chic village-style mall, at the southernmost end of the Strip, so there is plenty of parking.  Obrigado!",

They had lots of upscale items available instead of the cheap options other places give you.  The servers were all extremely hospitable and helpful.

I will not go into detail about this horrible experience, as we were there to celebrate a birthday, and this occurrence really ruined the celebration mood.  Good customer service needs to be taught to the employees here in the Las Vegas branch of Texas de Brazil.  They are terribly lacking in that department.  Treat your customers as if your jobs and reputation depends on it.  Just saying.",

They also have a lot of appetizers such as salads, soups, and antipasto. The way this place works is that everyone gets a card with red on one side and green on the other side. So basically red means stop and green means keep it coming. The meat carvers/servers will walk around and ask if you want the type of meat they serve if your card is green. There are tons of different cuts so try to find the one you like the most and enjoy.   Food - 9.5/10 Cleanliness - 9/10 Staff - 9.5/10",

My favorite was the lamb chops. Pace yourself; there is a lot to try. Don't get filled up on the salad bar if you can control yourself! The fried bananas were yummy.

The service is great except for the hostess... she couldn't smile not once. I asked her a simple question and she was a little rude. And I guess she tried to \"make up\" for it when she told me one dish had lobster (which is the soup). Also, she briefly explained the cocktail menu and asked if we have been here before. We said yes. Then she asked my boyfriend if he needed an explanation of the menu. He said no because we know how it works and she goes, \"Well Im going to explain it anyway.\" Excuse you??? And I thought maybe she wasn't having it at the time she sat us, but she sat a party behind us and even gave them attitude. Hostess is an important job. You are the first face of the restaurant and that means first impression. I would seriously give this place 3 stars because of her!! I am BIG on customer service. If the service is trash, I wouldn't come back no matter how great the food is. BUT! Our server Jay (his name was more difficult and he told us to call him Jay) was SOOOO nice and kind. He was attentive and I liked that. He smiled the whole time he was explaining things to us. He was just amazing really. He will make this experience great!  The salad bar has variety of different veggies and side dishes to choose from. There's even rice and soup off to the side of the bar. I haven't tried the soup but their salami and grape salad is great! The cheese is rich in flavor and overall a good taste. But save room for the meat that goes around! It's kind of entertaining to watch these people walk around with the huge stick with meat on it! They offer meats such as: lamb, different steaks, & chicken. And the size portions aren't too large so you can try different things! Pretty decent place & i would definitely come back!!",

    "text": "Everything about my experience at Texas de Brazil was awesome. Their restaurant is really well laid out an acoustically very nice. The one thing I would say is that if you're going to go for dinner make sure you go on an empty stomach because there are no doggie bags although you will want to take some food home with you.   From the filet mignon wrapped in bacon to the top sirloin or the chicken wrapped in bacon - all of the meats were incredible and totally worth going for the. The salad bar was excellent as well I got a lot of olives with the mini corns - those are too funny.   Carlos was our server and he made sure that we always had a clean plate or our drinks were topped off. The entire experience was 5 stars and if I wanted to eat that much every day or spend $50 a meal... this would be the spot!",

Manager could care less about REPEAT customers having a bad experience during a birthday celebration. We contacted corporate and pretty much got the same response with generic \"valued customer\" email. Wow! Good food but Applebee's  quality service. What a shame, but we value our dollars and will spend them somewhere else. Plenty of other options within 5 miles.",

The protein selections are incredible.  I highly suggest trying the Pork Tenderloin...  definitely a favorite!  The staff was so helpful and pleasant.

Even the managers were talking. We only got half of the meat choices that we normally receive. The meat was dry and not fresh. The salad bar looked old. I even had to pick out the wilted slimy salad, left it on the counter hoping that they would notice. The soup was not hot. It took 10 minutes for someone to ask for my drink order. I didn't bother to complain because I won't be back. There are plenty of GREAT places to eat in Vegas. I am giving 2 stars because it was clean.",

This place is wonderful to host a dinner a party, because everyone can find something they love; between the salad bar, the soup bar, the meats, and dessert this place is surely a crowd pleasure.   However, I will say that this place can become very crowded and you must submit the exact number of people in your party, because if you must add an additional person at the last minute, this restaurant is not willing to accommodate the change. Lastly, if you are celebrating a special event, make sure you keep any birthday cakes, balloons, rings, or any special celebration enhancements with you as they will charge you a $15.00 holding fee (which I have never heard of before in my life), but they do. So, I now know that in future when I wish to celebrate a special event with this restaurant, I know that I will not ask them to hold my cake for me.",

They had the brazillian sausage, bacon wrapped chicken, bacon wrapped filet mignon, garlic filet mignon, al caprino, lamb chops and a few others that I can't recall.  The waitress was great and very attentive.  The hostesses could be a little friendlier, they didn't really greet us when we entered, instead just told us to wait and they will call us when it's our turn.  But overall I had a great experience dining here and I will definitely be returning.  Make sure you make reservations though!",

Other then that the staff is exceptional very polite very accommodating and will refill your ice water w/o asking. They have a big staff which makes it so you never have to call the waiter for anything, there is multiple waiters coming to your table w diff kinda of meat less then every 5 min thank you!

    "text": "Quality. Service. Taste. And did I mention all the food you can stomach?? Everything about our experience at Texas de Brazil was aces except the table/room I reserved. Let me explain...  We were gonna be in town for several days for a bachelor party and I had called to reserve a table for 10. I signed up for their online newsletter and it alerted me to them having private rooms available. I inquired about that and Natasha said we could have that room for our party as it was not reserved yet. I called about 2 months prior to our weekend in Vegas. I even asked Natasha if the room would be able to handle a couple of more people as our party number might fluctuate closer to the date. She assured me that the room is spacious enough to hold up to 50 and it was all ours. Awesome! Well, the weekend came around and on the day of our dinner reservation I got a call to confirm. I called back and did so. No word of any issues, so I didnt worry... Problem was when I got there, I was told by the hostess and later by the manager that the private room wasnt available as it had been booked already but Natasha wasnt aware. Hmmm... Really?? Now you tell me?... Sounds fishy. Sounds like you booked a bigger party in that room and bumped us. I wasnt told that but I'm not a fool. All they needed to do was ask me and I wouldve given up that room to the bigger party. No problem. Instead I was given a lame excuse that I wasnt buying. A nice establishment like this, and they dont have all their reservations synched?? C'mon now! Anyways, that was not cool... And I had to tell the story. The manager was apologetic and promised to give us a table kind of off to the side and we kinda did. It was whatever by then...We were hungry and we were seated.  The food was great. All the cuts of meat we had were delicious. The various cuts of beef, chicken & pork were great. I really liked the bacon wrapped filet.The brazilian sausage was delish. Pork ribs I missed out on but I heard they were great. Bacon wrapped chicken was also good. Parmesan crusted pork loin was tasty. Flank steak was delicious.The herb-marinated pork loin was also good. Meat wasted for sure. The salad and sides bar was good. I liked the charcuterie. The prosciutto was good with bread and cheese. The string beans and garlic mash was great. But the True star was the LOBSTER BISQUE. I had heard about this greatness for a while and it lived up to the hype. So good. You will want to have bowl and bowls of it. Yumm.  Service was attentive. They were always around offering us the different cuts of beef, clearing our dishes and refilling our drinks. The only issue was with our reservation. Had to deduct a star for that. I considered deducting more but the experience otherwise was great. Like I said, I signed up for their online newsletter and timing was with us as I got an email giving parties of up to 10 to be given $10 off each person making it $40 instead of $50 for dinner. (Mon-Thurs). Cool beans. We were there on a Thursday night so it was perfect. I suggest signing up.   I plan on eating there again the next time we're in town. I will make reservations again. I hope that aspect is far improved on the next trip. Lobster bisque!!",

Vinnie forgot to add my b-day promo code to the bill. (Which took way too long to rectify.) Then, my husband mentioned it was my birthday, and after sitting for what seemed at least another 15 minutes, waiting for my birthday cake, we decided to pay the bill and leave. Not forgetting that we asked several times for filet and lamb, at a certain temperature, during the meal, and that was yet another long waiting game.  Signed, Not Pleased.",

The staff is very nice and professional as they are attentive to all their guest needs. The food is always fresh and rarely was the meat ever brought around not hot. Some Brazilian steakhouses will rotate the floor for a long period of time with the meat, but not here. Almost always sizzling hot to your table. This salad bar is by far the best one in town, from salad to ceviche onion to shrimp to salmon to soups to delectable sauces, so on and so on. I tried a few Brazilian steakhouses in town, but nothing compares to the quality and experience you have at Texas de Brazil!",

Honestly if I go again I'll just get the salad bar because it isn't just a salad bar at all, so much amazing yummy different things. Meats and amazing lobster bisque. We hardly ate any of the meat they walk around and serve and we paid like $20 extra for that (which was fine because we wanted the whole experience). But the salad bar would fill anyone up.   Patricia was our waitress and she was amazing, so sweet and on her game. Polite and made our experience one of a kind. I would like to personally thank her.  We had a $25 off for joining the club type thing they had online, and since it was our anniversary we got a free piece of cake! So we got $34 off our bill.   I think the ONLY negative thing I could say is when you first walk in, a proper greeting would be nice. We stood there for a minute before anyone even said hi.",

This place is a carnivores paradise and an ethical vegans worst nightmare. So much meat is paraded upon the floors of this place one could assume sacrifices to the meat gods were made here. This may be True...  The meat options are numerous. Filet Mignon, Bacon wrapped Filet Mignon, chicken, lamb chops, the list is impressively long. Your servers will be roaming the floors constantly with an infinite supply of skewered options so be on the lookout. Your meat will be prepared the way you want it and all you have to do is ask. An endless supply of delicious bread balls of happiness are sent to your table along with fried bananas and mash potatoes. Honorable mention also goes to the best salad bar potentially in Las Vegas. Lobster bisque, an assortment of cheeses and excellent couscous are just a small part of their master operation. Yes, even the palace of steaks caters to those that prefer lettuce.   Desserts are beyond good. The Brazilian Cheesecake is an addiction made manifest. The Brazilian Papaya Creme is a good back up option and of course Creme Brulee if you must. During this Bazaar of Beef be sure to order a Brazilian soda purely because they exist and need to be consumed.    5 Stars for this paradise of meat. Be ready to eat and bring a friend to carry you out.",

They come around quite often, I love the rare steaks and the lamb, So many different kinds to pick from,  If you don't get full its your own fault!  There is so many different things to try!  This place gets pretty busy and it is a good idea to have reservations but from what i am reading from some of the other reviews it don't matter if you have one. We have never had a problem getting in.  I love their food and it is hard to compare to other Brazilian restaurants. This one is pretty busy compared to some of the other ones. It is really good.  We highly recommend if you have never had Brazilian food before this is the one to go to first, it was our first and it really made a impression on us for the flavors and all the different meats they have. Try it out!!!",

Grilled lamb, sausage, ribs, filet mignon, chicken, flank steak, sirloin, pork; so much meat. The grilled yum is carved table side. You may have rare, medium, well cooked or anything in-between, you choose.  Chebe bread ((it is gluten free pretty sure)) is on the table, round, warm, cheesy and perfect!  The wait staff was helpful and prompt. Restaurant is immaculate, and beautiful. Close to the strip, great location for locals as well as visitors. Yes there is free parking, in a lot. I know right?

It's really easy to dry the chicken breast on the grill (in my opinion) but I was surprised how good they cooked the meat. $50 per head but they offer special price to children and discounts to military, veterans, firefighters, teachers, seniors etc. Don't forget to check out the web site and make reservation before going there.",

    "text": "Pro Tip: if you ask for the servers to send you the man with the fillet, they will, and then you can really get your money's worth. Don't fill up on salad bar (although it's so easy to do) and don't fill up on bacon-wrapped chicken and flank steak (although both are delicious). When they guys come around with the really good cuts, like tenderloin, load up on that.  Great meats, a great atmosphere, great sides, and a huge salad bar. I love coming here, I just wish I was rich so I could do it more often. Even though it's pricey, I still feel like I always get what I payed for.   The salad bar, by the way, is not limited to just salads. It also contained smoked salmon, various cured meats, and sushi. It's extremely easy to fill up on just the salad bar -- if that's what you're into, or you just want to save money, they also offer a salad-bar-only menu option. I've considered doing it, but never gone through with it. The siren song of those steaks and roasts is just too much for me.",

We did the AYCE lunch special where servers are coming around serving different types of meat on sticks and cut the pieces right in front of your eyes. The meat was flavorful and good job on preparing the lamb; there was no game aftertaste which I dislike! The salad bar had a good selection along with dipping sauces, soups, and appetizers. One thing was a bit disappointing was the service. Our server did a good job in checking up on us but he always look grumpy and felt annoyed when we requested for something (maybe having a bad day?).",

Very friendly service, and quality of food was very good.  Meats may be slightly less flavorful than FDC, but still good.  House special meat really great, very good options at the salad bar.  We also got free dessert which they don't offer at FDC, but think that's only on the weekend.  Way better than the casino buffet scene, definitely recommend.",

Every year my wife and I ( person of colors) celebrate our anniversary and birth days in this restaurant for the past three years. We have been there for 6 to 7 times. Out of this 7 time we sat 5 times on the most uncomfortable table in the house, near the salad bar and on the way to the kitchen. A lot of people move around and it is uncomfortable. My wife always complain about it, I always say it is okay we are here let's enjoy the food. Last week I attended a seminar about implicit bias and the trainer shared one of her horrible experience in a restaurant, all the colored people were sent to the last row near the reset room by one attendant and any colored people who got a front seat of the line are sent by other attendants. Right there it hit me we were treated differently because we were person of color. As I remember all the time we were assigned that sit the restaurant was half empty. I like this place but they have to hire people who don't have implicit biases.",

I had one piece of the tenderloin beef that was excellent.  The rest I found tasteless, or a chemically taste that you sometimes get off grills.  The chicken was okay, rather dry and even though I am not a lamb fan I still tried to see if it changed my mind and it didn't.",

But the last two times here have been a complete disaster!!  My cousin and I waited about 20 min even though we already had a reservation, eh, no problem. We sat down and had the first round of meats then we didn't see anyone for 15 min, I mean NO ONE, not our waiter or any carvers! Our waiter came by and I told him the issue a few minutes later 2 carvers stopped by then nothing again for 15 min and this was a slow day according to our waiter and 2 carvers. The waiter apologized and mentioned it to the manager which I believe is the GM cause I remember him when it first opened up. I asked to speak to the manager since I had to wave down carvers and the manger didn't come to talk to me. The waiter apologized again and pointed him out to me to talk to him on the way out. We had the VIP card which is always returned to us by a manager once they stamp it and come thank you for being a regular VIP customer, again he avoided us and had the waiter bring us the card back. To top it off he has the nerve to look me in the eye and walk away into the kitchen area when he saw us walk toward him. I waited a few minutes and just left.  The food is good if you actually have carvers who know what you like and make sure they visit the table regularly but the service has been horrible!!!! I cancelled having a birthday dinner there for this disrespect!",

The meat just didn't taste extraordinary to me.  Maybe the draw is that you can get it in abundance.  The desserts, even on the tray of fake desserts, looked amazing.  My friend, the birthday celebrant, had the carrot cake which she said was very moist and tasty.  I had the Brazilian Cheesecake which was so good that I would return for that alone.",

Their sides, soups (lobster bisque in specific) mash potatoes, banana to cleanse your pallet between meats, papaya parfait are delicious! I tired so many different types of red meats, and chicken!

I loved the variety of items at the salad and hot food bars. I really appreciated the fact that everything was always being replenished. The two ladies who were our servers were so sweet. They made some really great suggestions. I loved the beef ribs. When I couldn't find them anymore I was devastated. But to my rescue, my server was able to ask some fine gentlemen to bring some over for our table. That was fantastic!! I swear, those beef ribs are life changingly delicious.   I couldn't imagine how in the world I was going to be able to consume my $50 worth of meat and sides but I noticed that if you sign up for their email based club online, before your visit, you will receive a $25 off coupon. I know, for a fact, that I would not be dining here too often if anytime real soon. So, I signed up and thought that it would be the perfect opportunity to use that voucher for my meal. So, I ended up paying about $25 for my dinner, before taxes, drinks, tip, etc. That was definitely helpful in making it feel more affordable.",

The service here is pretty top notch. It's one of those places you will enjoy with a family or a hungry date at that. More like for big group of friends. It's definitely a little more upscale than normal. The location it's a little bit on the low scoring. Got my car broken into and it's very far from the strip.

We went for Sunday lunch which included dessert (take the dessert to go because if you're still hungry at the end of the meal you're not doing it right). The Brazilian cheesecake was my go-to but the key lime pie and papaya ice cream are also great choices.  I've been to 3 different locations in 3 states and this one in Vegas is always my favorite. If you like quality meat and high-end salad bar options you will not be disappointed. On this most recent visit we tried 11 different meats and all were delicious. Surprisingly the cheaper cuts of meat were the best. The salty juicy beef that's the house specialty (sorry I don't remember the name) and the Brazilian sausage were my favorites! From the salad bar the aged Parmesan cheese, marinated mushrooms, and lobster bisque are must haves.  Our waiter was fantastic as well, our glasses were never empty and the dead pan humor was superb. We brought two friends with us who were visiting for the first time, they were not disappointed.  For a chain restaurant quality is not usually a strength but for this chain they deliver every time! Thanks for another unforgettable experience.",

Sides were amazing, especially the lobster bisque. I ate 3 bowls. The veggies were so fresh and everything went so well together. Service was great. My uncle can't eat pork so we loved the beef options, especially the beef rib. My fave was the house sirloin and anything that was wrapped in bacon. This was a treat for us all. Definitely would come again but will probably skip dessert. It was too rich. The big hit was the Brazilian cheesecake. Don't pass this place up and be sure to make reservations.",

I haven't been here in awhile because of how pricey it is, but my boyfriend had his work party here the other night so it was time to give the place another try. I have to say, that I do really enjoy their food choices. I love meat, but don't eat it that often as I stick to poultry and seafood, but it was a nice change and all the meats I tried were delicious. The salad bar was ok. They had a lot of cheese and meat choices and a few different salads. It wasn't a huge selection, but it was more than enough to fill my plate, not leaving any room for when the guys with the meat came around. lol The filet mignon wrapped in bacon was one of the best options, in my opinion. The sausage was really good too. Good think about Brazilian steakhouses is that you get to try a big variety of different meats and usually can't go wrong with any of them. We tried some of the desserts after dinner, even though I don't think anybody really had room for them and they were ok. I got the cheesecake, but I wasn't really impressed. I kind of wish I would've gotten something different. The problem I did have was the service. We had a private room with about 12 of us so we weren't a super large group, but every time I asked for something, I had to ask multiple times because he kept forgetting about me. By the time everybody else was done, I still haven't received anything I asked for and ended up getting it after I was done. The service was definitely disappointing.",

This is honestly not only an amazing restaurant but also an amazing experience, something you must do at least once.   Dinner runs about $50 a person but trust me you will eat much more the $50 worth.   You start by being seated ( we had a 8pm reservation, showed up a bit early and was seated promptly at 8) they take your drink order water is free, everything else is extra. They have a extensive amazing drink menu with everything from cocktails to 5 pages of wine. Your then sent to get your plate and start off at the \"Salad Bar\" which feels wrong giving it such a basic name because not only does it have salad options you have amazing veggies options, cheese, salami, shrimp, salmon, over 50+ options. AND THE SOUP THE CRAB BISQUE do not forget to try it. I would go there just for the crab bisque.  You then head back to your table where you are in the greatest way bombarded by meat options from carver after carver. Every kind of meat you can imagine cooked and seasoned to perfection! Bring your fat pants because you will need them!  They then offer you a dessert menu which is all the desserts on all a platter (fake but they look real lol) and you take your choosing.   The staff is amazing from the greeters, servers, and carvers! I can't wait to come back!!!",

You have to request the House Picana (Sirloin) and Beef Rib served on a silver platter for sure and often. Everything on the menu for me is tasty and prepared to your likings (rare to well done), and don't be afraid to let the waiters know, and your meal and experience will be well worth the price! The desserts especially the chocolate layer mouse cake is very good also. Make sure you take the time to make a reservation because this place will get packed really fast! I recommend this restaurant if you like meat, and lots of it because it keeps coming, and coming etc.",

Once we arrived I was excited to dig and enjoy some  great food, unfortunately my son fell sick and started throwing up before I could eat anything, as a concerned mother my focus was to get my child to urgent care. I told my husband to pay the bill while I took our child to the car, well they still charged for me even though I didn't eat anything. I called back the following week explained the situation and if just for me since I was not able to eat that I could get a voucher for me to come back. the manager said they would have to get back to me because they needed to talk to the waiter, i never received a call back. I then had to call back the next day to be told that the manager i spoke to was gone for the day. I called back again had to explain my story to another manager just to be told that I should have talked to a manager the night every thing happened and the best they could do is give me 20 percent off. Like hellloo my child was sick, did you really expect me to wait for a manager to show up while my child kept throwing. And on top of that when we were seated it took 20 minutes before our waiter came, and that was after someone had to go find him and let him know he had a table. overall it was a bad experience during the dinner and bad customer service addressing my complaint after.",

The $50 a person is a bit pricey especially since that does not include a drink or desert.  But it is still worth it. Definitely will come back.",

Everywhere we go, we usually get a steakhouse in there somewhere. Our experience in Texas de Brazil was phenomenal. The salad bar was really good.. but trust me, you go for the meat. My wife kept eating the beans (Feijoada) and she normally doesn't eat beans at all. The service was also really nice.. we had our luggage with us and they kept it aside while we were in the restaurant. Overall great experience. Not overpriced either.",

We arrived a little early for our reservation, so we past the time in the bar. Very nice bartender who whipped us up a couple Caipirinhas. I'm glad we weren't too early because I could have went through a few of those, really good.  We got situated at our table. Service was great start to finish. We began with the salad bar. Salad bar is more of a generic description of it. There are so many yummy selections to choose from. Maybe mini buffet is a better description. Here is where the challenge lies though. You're in a Brazilian churrascaria, which means you're there for meat, and do they have the meat. You also want to get your moneys worth. The dinner and drinks add up quickly.  If you make the mistake of trying everything the mini buffet has to offer, then the house wins and you won't be able to get your carnivorous ways on very much, nor your moneys worth. Resist the temptation of sampling a lot of that stuff and get your fill of meat. You can get what the salad bar has to offer at a lot of other places in Vegas, but you can't get that Brazilian steakhouse goodness at many, if any.",

I tried all 16 different cuts of meat and will say that some of them are a little salty but with a side of adult beverage it's all good. I will certainly recommend this place to anyone looking for fine dining and scared to take a try on one of the many Vegas buffets lol.

Were from California so i was not expecting the meat to be served to us on giant sticks,fresh off the grill. They literally cut the piece of meat you would like onto your plate. It was an interesting type of buffet!  The filet mignon and house sirloin were definitely my favorites of the night! Also their grapes (covered in blue cheese and mayo) were surprisingly delicious! The only thing i was disappointed in was the chicken. I didnt really enjoy the flavor of the chicken. It tasted dry at times compared to the beef! I couldn't stop eating the red meat! Even when i was full-just eating for the taste!   Everyone was so friendly and Richie our server was definitely THE BEST. 5stars for customer service! Overall very good experience!

This was my first time at any churrasco place, so it was definitely different than what I'm used to when it comes to AYCE. Servers go around with different meat that you can try, which is pretty cool. But if there's a certain meat you really like & want more of, you have to wait til they come back around to your table.  Meats were good & tasty. Some were too salty for my taste, but everything was really good. There's a buffet table with sides, salads, veggies, soups, etc. that you can go up to as frequently as you like. Their lobster bisque was really good.  One major downside is that dessert ISN'T included in the price! You'd think after paying $50/person for dinner would include dessert, unfortunately, that's not the case =/  It's obviously not a restaurant I'd go to frequently due to their price & amount of food one could consume, but it's definitely a good place to go to for special occasions.  Word of advice:  - Don't eat too much sides as you'd want to get your money's worth on the meat. - Eat each meat as you get them. If you wait (which sometimes takes them a while to get to your table), the quicker you'll get full.",

You turn over a red circle to present a green circle which signals the servers walking around with meat to stop by you table and offer you some meat. Immediately when we turned our circle over, we were bombarded by servers. A bit shocked to be honest, but the house special sirloin was amazing.  Some of the servers would come even when you circle was red, but it wasnt the end of the world. I would say the food itself was not enough for the price, but with the presentation and experience was definitely worth it. Planning to visit this place when i come back to Vegas!",

I had the zucchini, asparagus, sauteed mushrooms, jasmine rice, slivers of Parmesan cheese, salami, crusty baguettes, tomatoes.  The meats that were served table side were tender and favorful.  Definitely a must if you're a meat lover!",

They come around to your table with different cuts of meat.. At $50 a person you can pretty much eat your monies worth and more!   They offer a salad bar with all types of items to choose from.. My favorites are the lobster bisque, mushrooms with the sauce, tomatoes, green beans, roasted garlic, and don't forget the chimichurri sauce!  When you're ready for them to bring on the meat just flip over your button to the green side and get your tongs ready! My favorites are the house special, bacon wrapped filet, lamb chops, leg of lamb, garlic sirloin, flank steak,  beef ribs, and pork ribs! Lol almost everything.. They also bring complimentary bread, mash potatoes, and sugar plantains..   So yea I do love this place! A great place to celebrate anything, or just to go eat! Join their online club for discounts! They offer $25 off a dinner for 2 for birthday's and anniversaries! 20% off to military, veterans, and law enforcements!! Score!!",

They have a small pog like card that you use to get more meat or stop them from coming to your table. They should change that to a light in the middle of the table. It's hard for meat servers to see it through all the dishes that are piling up. At first it's overwhelming with guys coming up to your table with big slabs of meat but then you get the hang of it. Every meat we had was tender juicy and cooked just the way you asked. The pork and the chicken. Didn't like those two choices. Tried the lamb which is new for me and it was delicious. Would love to have a choice of hot veggies for my side and maybe something for small kids that are forced to sit in at adult venues. And the margaritas suck. It's all about the wine.",

Our server was amazing and re-seated us (even though they were incredibly busy) at a larger table so we could put her car seat on a chair and allow us to spread out. While a small gesture, this truly made our evening and allowed us to enjoy ourselves as our newborn slept peacefully and safely. We love this place!",

A lot of our mutual friends agreed that this place was the bomb diggity.   The wait staff is VERY attentive. They fold your napkins when you are away from the table and are SUPER on top of drinks. All the food is delicious and there really isn't anything to complain about.   TIPS AND TRICKS:   I would suggest going to lunch rather than dinner. Dinner price is 50 dollars and lunch is 30. The only difference is that lunch doesn't include sushi, heart of palm, and buffalo mozzarella at the salad bar. I love the heart of palm and mozzarella but I'd rather have a cheaper bill.   Lunch is also a lot more laid back than dinner. Not that fancy is a bad thing! It's just what you are in the mood for that day, I suppose.   My favourites include the fried bananas, lamb chops, and Brazilian sodas.  I would also suggest getting a dessert, specifically the cheesecake. While it's not included in the meal, it's definitely worth the extra charge. And if you get the lunch with a desert, it's still cheaper than the dinner charge! ;D  ALSO! MAKE A RESERVATION. THIS PLACE GETS PRETTY PACKED.",

There are many fresh and delicious options. You can just have the salad bar, but unless you are a vegetarian, why would you? The meat options are nearly endless, and simply seasoned which makes them all so good. Everything is excellent,  with the exception of their desserts. I never care for their desserts and think they must be brought in from an outside vendor. They don't taste fresh made and never leave me satisfied. The only downside for a local, is it is located in a very touristy area. We still go several times a year because it is so good overall.",

On Friday I called to make a reservation for 3 people for 8:00pm . When we arrived there the lady said she don't see any reservation. I showed her my phone the it show my call record . One of her supervisors came and checked my phone and looked at me and said \"you really made a reservation in 47 seconds?! It is impossible \" I was shocked and surprised! Do you really think I will lie about making a restaurant reservation??? Why do I need to lie? And what kind of service is that that you pointed at me as I am lying to you ! Why do I need to lie about reservation. I asked him to call the lady who takes reservations . But he looked at me with ridiculous smile ! I am pregnant women with a child who was hungry but this guy obviously don't know how to give service. After 20 minutes they found us a table . Everything else was great .  changed to 2 stars now because after I talked with customer service they promise they will send me something for compensation. The sent me 15% so ridiculous I can't get that 15% off and even more from the emails they sending . It's better if them not to contact me than giving me this ridiculous compensation",

    "text": "So coming from a small island, I've never had the opportunity to partake in Brazilian food. But my oh my, I'm so glad I came here. This is an all you can eat meat place. They have this huge salad bar that consists of veggies, bread, cold meats, soup of the day, hot starch, and cheese. Our server was a very friendly lady, sorry forgot to ask her her name, who always made sure we were doing alright. The men that came around with the meat on the stick were really friendly, and even if we didn't have our card flipped they would ask us if we wanted more meat.  The meal includes bottomless nonalcoholic drinks and a dessert of your choosing. Now let's talk about meat. I'm personally a girl who loves her salt, species, and rare to med rare meat. Also I've been to my share of steakhouses that for the most part don't impress me. But this meat actually met my standards. My favorites were the Brazilian picanha, brazilian alcatra, and lamb chops. These meats were tender, moist, tasty, and actually medium rare. Overall I really like this place, and think the rest of my family would enjoy this too. Can't wait to eat here again when I visit Vegas next time!",

We ended up spending 185.00 for the two of us for dinner and two alcoholic drinks each. So not worth it. The meats that came around were not that flavorful, the steak was tough. The best thing about the meal were the cinnamon sugar bananas. The cost of the meal was not worth it at all. We won't be going back at all. Salad bar was 'meh', as well.",

    "text": "This was my 2nd time at this restaurant! My 1st time was for a birthday party for a friend and there were about 15 of us!  Prices - $49 per person or $25 for salad/soup bar only Drinks - we had a beer $6 and a glass of wine $11  The food at the salad/soup bar area is always very fresh and very good! The service our 1st time here was amazing but I'm thinking that's because a lot of people were ordering drinks and tipping very well!   The reason for my 3 stars is because of our 2nd time here, which was a date night for the hubby and myself that we had made prior reservations for and when we arrived we were told that it would be a minute for our table... A minute turned into about 20 minutes and then when we were brought to our table we were basically shoved into a back corner on a tiny table against a wall where we sat facing each other! I could not even get out of my chair without bumping into the people at the table beside ours! It also was a little frustrating because there was very little plate space, which each person gets 2 (one for the salad bar & one for your meats). Definitely was not enough room for 4 plates, our 2 drinks, the appetizer bananas and mashed potatoes they bring you... Along with a basket of rolls.  Also, we kept getting skipped by the meat servers bc I honestly don't think they could even see us.  I feel the servers cater more to the larger parties.  As far as price, it is a great price for the amount and quality of food as long as you can eat a lot! For someone like myself who can only eat a salad, a side or 2, and one steak filet... I could go to a fine restaurant and get just the same thing if not a little better for less. My husband loves it though, he can eat much more, so the fact that he can have steak, chicken, pork, lamb, etc in the same sitting is great!  I do recommend this restaurant for the quality of food and the experience of you have never been somewhere like this. Just be sure to come with an appetite. I do not recommend this for a party of only 2... It was very uncomfortable!",

I came here on a Sunday night but made an rsvp a week early because some of my coworkers were telling me, it's a nightmare trying to get a table the day of. Plan ahead everyone!  I love love love this restaurant. To be honest I can just come here for their lobster bisque and the cheese bread. It's so delicious. The system here is pretty simple. You have a coaster looking thing on your table. Flip it to the color GREEN and all the workers start coming to you asking you if you would like the type of meat they are serving.  They had an numerous selection of meat such as Lamb chops, chicken, filet mignon, bacon wrapped filet mignon, sausages and many more. After trying everything and your full, simply flip your card over to the color RED which indicates to stop and the workers will not offer you any more meats.  The salad bar area is pretty yummy as well. I love the salad, shrimp,  jasmine white rice, sushi & asparagus. The best part of all this is... IT'S ALL YOU CAN EAT!  I recommend this restaurant! Just be ready to eat!!!! Trust me, your going to want to taste everything \"twice\"",

Our waiter helped us immediately. He asked if we were celebrating a special occasion and we let him know about the birthday. When he saw we were choosing a bottle of wine he gave great suggestions and let us know they had a special with 50% off a second bottle which was a great deal! They had a good range of options ranging from $35 on up, very reasonable prices.  Of course the meat was the star and fantastic as always. So many choices! All very well cooked. And the salad bar was terrific too. Definitely try the lobster bisque if it's available.  As a final nice touch the waiter offered the desserts and they do a little extra for birthdays. I chose an amazing cheesecake with chocolate on the bottom, caramel on top and they had the plate nicely decorated with happy birthday written in chocolate. This was a terrific meal and experience for a decent price. The two bottles of wine, two meals and dessert came in around $160 without tip. I've paid way more for this quality of food at other places.",

Chances are unless you have a reservation, you'll have to wait for a table, but that's ok because they have a great bar.   Was there with 3 others, and we only waited for about 20 minutes.   They have a great salad bar, but don't fill up on any of that.  Only pick a few things that you'd like to have in between rounds of meat!   The bacon wrapped filet was very good as was the sirloin.   Most everything was very good.   If you're on a low sodium diet, be careful, this places uses salt to season their beef.   It makes it taste great, but there is salt involved.     Will I be back?

My personal favorite was the flank steak! Staff is very attentive to your needs. Our waiter was great! Only downfall is that fountain drinks, such as Coke, are NOT free refills and it is not stated anywhere, so when you get your check, you'll see multiple drink charges. They serve everything in wine glasses with 3/4 filled with ice. Would be back, but would definitely have to be in the mood for a lot of meat.",

    "text": "This is my go to spot when my steak cravings flare up. I love steakhouses, but sometimes a craving needs to be satisfied with excessive amounts of red meat.   My first tip is to eat here for lunch or brunch on a weekend. It's cheaper than dinner and having been here for dinner I can't find a difference in the foods offered.   The salad bar is good enough to make a meal. That is coming from a meat fan. The salad bar has much more than the average salad bar. It includes smoked salmon, assorted cheeses, several veggie salads, fruit salads, lobster bisque, and sushi. I also find it hard to resist filling up on just the salad bar.   Before the meal the server will bring out plantains, mashed potatoes, and cheddar biscuits. All of the above are delicious and yet another temptation I have to resist before the meat arrives. The plantains are my favorite!   The first time I came here I thought that the meat would be abundant, but mediocre quality. I was completely wrong. The meats are actually delicious and well seasoned. The variety should please all tastes too. They offer parmesan chicken, several cuts of steak, lamb, and sausage. The steaks are my favorite meats.   The service is very attentive. Someone is always at the table offering meat or refilling drinks. The servers are always really good about getting certain meats to the table if you have a preference. On one visit my husband ordered a cocktail that he didn't care for, nothing was wrong with the drink. Our waitress noticed he didn't drink it and insisted on taking the drink off of the bill. We never expected this or asked her to do this, but that to me is great service.  MEAT!",

Just the wait for the meat to come was more annoying than anything.  Our table kept getting missed most of the time. We're sitting there with empty plates and waiting for the meat to come and it would about 7 minutes for it to come and you get a bite size piece and then wait more time. It was annoying. I never once throughout the night had at least half full plate of meat. Other than that the meat was great, well season and cooked at perfect temperature. We interacted with the server 4 times in the entire time span we were there. We didn't need much from her, but a few more check ins would have been nice, she might have seen my empty place more often. All in all it was a good night, great food mediocre service. Might think twice about going there again when more places like this are opening in the valley. That night wasn't worth. Who know, maybe service will improve in the near future.",

Service is fast and the waiters are very attentive to your every need. Don't like your meats medium-rare, no problem. Just tell the waiter how you like it and, voila! You get it your way!

Reservations are definitely recommended. Lunch is usually a jalapeno cream soup and dinner the lobster bisque. Both soups are delicious. The meats are usually medium to medium rare, but you can request a different doneness and they will come back. The banana fosters cake is my favorite dessert, but their chocolate mousse cake is also delish w/o being overly sweet. Drinks are desserts are extra and definitely a little pricey.",

Located on the edge of town square, which is on Las Vegas Blvd not a far drive from the strip.   Make a reservation. You don't need to dress up major but it is a nice place and very busy. Worth the wait, the hype is real.   I got a little bit of everything naturally and was very pleased with it all. Salad bar is very good quality with lots of options I enjoyed. Salmon, grapes, olives, cheeses, cucumbers, and so much more. The house vinaigrette was so good to top it all. Lobster bisque was nice, pineapple slices were so good, loved everything.  After dishing my salad we at and found they had already brought us bread, potatoes, and bananas. Soon after several meat carvers came around. You may have to wait to get seated but when you do the food comes fast and from every angle. So much fun.   Simply flip this card over they give you and they will stop bringing meat, flip it back over when ready for more fresh meats.  This kept the meat carving service at the pace you want.   Speaking of service it was absolutely amazing teamwork the whole time. The waiter and staff really impressed me with their attention to detail. Removing plates very quick. Refills often. Once noticing that I was little worried a piece of meat was too raw,  he instantly said if any meat is too raw for your liking just don't eat it and we'll bring another cooked just right.   Impressed with the service and staff for sure and just loved the food. I'll be back very often. Thanks again to yelp friends for helping me find this place. My phone battery died but I knew this meal was going to be so epic I bought a new S9 just to get the best pictures possible. Haha. Thanks for reading and hope you enjoy your meal if you visit. Take care.",

It is comparable to the more known Fogo de Chao... but better!    The atmosphere is elegant and welcoming.  Dinner is $49.99 per person which includes all the meat you can eat, plus the salad bar.  The salad bar had scalloped potatoes, black beans, lobster bisque, salad items, fruits, cheese and salami/prosciutto, veggies just to name a few.  My eyes were so wide with the variety that I filled my plate with the salad bar.    You are given a 2 sided mini coaster.  The red side means you do not want servers offering you food.  Green is go... and boy do they come.  High quality meats on large skewers are offered to you... They even ask if you have a meat temp preference.  Some meats were the sausage, parmesean chicken, bacon wrapped chicken, filet mignon, leg of lamb, and soo many others.  We tried a bit of most.  My fav was the sausage and chicken.    Service was extremely quick during the first half hour, then slowed down a bit towards the end.  We would definitely come back.  This place comes highly recommended.",

    "text": "I was very disappointed with my experience at the Texas de Brazil in Las Vegas. I've been to multiple Texas de Brazil's before, my favorite being the one in Fort Worth, TX, but my experience at this location was extremely subpar. When the meats came out, they were either blue rare or well done. There was no in-between. It was dry or chewy, which was very disappointing. It took about 20-25 minutes before our requested lamb chops came out, which is my favorite part! It was a Wednesday when I went, so it wasn't like it was insanely packed. Disappointed, I'll just stick to other locations.",

    "text": "Let me start off by saying that the dinner and service we had here last night was outstanding!! I see why this place has so many high ratings on Yelp. My boyfriend and I have been to Texas de Brazil many times and we've always had a good experience. This time, we came in as a group of 5 and last night's service really topped it and blew us away.   The food here is absolutely delicious. They have an impressive all-you-can-eat selection of well-seasoned meats that are carved and served at table side including filet mignon, flank steak, prime rib, lamb, pork, chicken, ribs, and even shrimp. In addition, they have a salad bar and an area with hot items where you can get sides to complement your meal. They even provide cheese bread (which I love), mashed potatoes, and plantains for the table to share. Be sure to have the card turned to green on your table to let the the staff know when it's ok to come around with various meats. You can even ask your server for a particular meat and they'll promptly come back per your request. If you're too full or just want to take a little break, simply turn the card over to red. Keep in mind to save some room for something sweet because their desserts are amazing! You can't go wrong with anyone of them.   Although the food is fantastic, what really stood out the most for us was the service we received here last night. Our server, Adam, made our dining experience a wonderful one with our friends. He was genuinely nice, easy to talk to, and had a great sense of humor. He was very attentive by checking on us frequently and making sure our water glasses were always filled to the top. He even came to our table several times to see if there were any other meats that we wanted to try again. He told the servers and they promptly came with no wait at all for our request.   This place is perfect for groups or a casual date night. Whenever we dine here, we always make a reservation through open table or on their website to avoid long waits. It's super quick and easy. They also have a promo for 20% HEROES' discount off your total bill for military members/veterans, law enforcement, firefighters, nurses, EMS and teachers. As a nurse, I love and respect an establishment that recognizes these professions. It was nice that we were able to get 20% off our entire bill.  Even though the price for dinner can be a bit on the high end, it's definitely worth every penny with the fantastic service from the staff and the amazing food. We will definitely be coming back.",

The meats they brought around were good although the filet dubbed medium rare was closer to well done than medium rare. One of our party was violently ill an hour after we left. The only thing he ate that we didn't was the pork loin. In addition the woman's bathroom was filthy when we arrived and we informed the check in girl about it and it still wasn't cleaned by the time we left. We'll stick to the one in Orlando.",

The skirt steak was a little more pink than skirt should be and the mash potatoes were a little flavorless but the well season meats made up for the flavor.   They did not honor our $20 off coupon when we presented it on our first time per manager, so make sure that when you sign up for the email club you talk to the manager about honoring the $20 off coupon.  Other than that, really great place to eat! Good atmosphere.",

    "text": "Note: A reservation isn't needed but I highly recommend getting a reservation as this place is always packed.   My family and I had reservations here at 7:15pm on Father's Day and it was very jam packed in there. It's $50 a person and it's basically a buffet and there are servers walking around telling you what meat it is and how it's prepared (filet mignon medium rare). As you are seated each one of you are given a card which you can flip over. The green side of the card means you're ready for more meat so the servers will come to you, while the red side means you're not ready for more and so the servers won't come to you. There are also other servers that don't carve the meat but instead check up on you and will give you a new plate if they see your plate is getting messy or if you're done with it. Considering it was Father's Day I didn't expect such a great service and coordination from the workers, but they really worked as a team. I tried a majority of the meat they carved and my favorite had to be the filet mignon, but you can't go wrong with any of their meats. As for the buffet section I LOVED their mushrooms and their potato salad. However if you want to get your moneys worth don't be a fool like me and eat all the carb heavy foods like the potato salad, mashed potatoes, cheese bread, and fried bananas. They have a wide variety of alcoholic beverages but the only downside was that I ordered two Midori sours and it was about $15 which is quite expensive as I've been to other high end restaurants with Midori sours that were only a fraction of the cost. Overall this place really does deserve 5 stars because the whole restaurant works as a team, servers were very attentive even on Father's Day, and the meat and food was prepared perfectly. Definitely a great place for to go to for any holiday or an occasion like Father's Day which also happened to be my dads birthday.",

Some of them didnt have salt it seemed like it was hit or miss, maybe something on my plate made them salty not too sure what happened. The ribs were all fat and I wish they would have told me that. I dont know of anyone especially at my table who wanted just fat? Some of the chicken pieces were really chewy. Service really lacked, it seemed like they'd wait for ages to come back to us.

The salad bar is large and a bit haphazard in the item selection.  I did not try any of the soups as the reason you are here is MEAT!    The sides brought table side are good but again, avoid them and stick with the meats.     The place is a bit pricy at 50 bucks a person for dinner and 3 bucks for a 8 oz bottle of soda.   They have some killer looking desserts but if did this place right, you will be in a meat coma before they show you the sweets.    Not really my kind of place so I am giving it three stars.   I would rather go to a good steakhouse rather than getting small cuts delivered when you flag down a server.",

Most of the meats they sliced at the table were very good, especially the steaks...The cheese bread they serve at the beginning of the meal was also very tasty! Over all the food was great.  Alex our server was very professional was attentive :) Unfortunately the wine list sucked...My friend and I were both surprised and disappointed.  We sampled quite a few reds before we decided on a bottle of Cab that was just mediocre.  I have been studying wine for quite some time, taking courses at Southern Wine & Spirits, working towards my certification as a Sommelier.  This is one area that the restaurant is really lacking. But overall I would highly recommend this restaurant for a great meal and dessert. Will be back! =)",

I also tried the other option in town which is Fogo de Chao and I have to say that this one offers better service and the meat is slightly superior quality. They also make sure that you always served in meat.   On the down side, I will say that the choice of meat is not as wide as you should normally find in a traditional Churascaria (I visited Rio de Janeiro couple of years ago and the Churascaria are truly amazing there). Also the buffet is average but you're coming for the meat.",

    "text": "First timers and cannot wait to go back again! A Brazilian steakhouse with a Texas spin... Service was extremely attentive from the hostess, our server, to the meat carvers! Recommend for going for lunch on the weekend, as non-alcoholic drinks & dessert are included in the $49.99 price! Also, if you are military, you receive 20% off your bill for a party up to 8 people! You're given a circular card, green side up means bring me more while red side up means give me a break. Being first timers, our server named Meagan did an excellent job of explaining everything so thoroughly! That alone justified a 20% tip!   The salad bar is quite extensive with 50 items. For $29.99 you can actually skip the meat and just fill up in the salad bar! But it's a steakhouse, so what's the point? Lol. It had a wide variety, including traditional salad items but also things like quinoa salad, shrimp salad, artichoke salad, mushroom salad -- basically a big range of different cold ones! Across from that, there is a warm selection of side dishes. The soup of the day was lobster bisque, which had a rich & tangy flavor. There were also potatoes au gratin, sauteed mushrooms (I got two servings of both of these! So good!), black beans, and white jasmine rice. The server also brings out a side dish of mashed potatoes, sweetened plantains and cheese filled knots of bread -- which I struggled not to fill up on! I had to keep reminding myself we were there to eat steak!   We were seated at the entrance of the kitchen so service from the men walking around with giant skewers of meat with large carving knives was amazing. If our cards were flipped up green, we were swarmed by them offering us different types ranging beef, lamb, pork, chicken, and sausage. Every single thing was seasoned & cooked to perfection... many cooked with the option of medium rare or well done. I personally did not try any of the pork/sausage, so I cannot give an opinion. I particularly did not like the chicken, as I found them to be dry. The lamb was dry as well, but extremely flavorful that I did not mind! Our personal favorites were the beef brisket (OMG, to die for! So incredibly good!), filet mignon & flank steak. Delicious!   Once we were finished, our server brought out a tray of desserts for us to choose from... but obviously we were stuffed & didn't leave room. She offered to box it up and let us take it home, which was very nice of her! We took home the double chocolate mousse & the banana foster. Both rich & perfectly sweet. And much more enjoyed since we didn't have to force ourselves to consume it before leaving. This seriously just adds to making this dining experience even better!  Will we return? Absolutely! Not a single complaint here! Five stars, nothing less. :)",

    "text": "A lot of my coworkers and I made a reservation here for a goodbye party. We were promptly seated and our waiter was there quickly to fill our water glasses. Each person is given a button with a green side and a red side. Green means more food and red means stop.   The wine list leaves much to be desired. After looking at the choices I couldn't find anything remotely sweet (even a white zin would have done, I didn't need moscato or anything). I was told Pinot Grigio was the sweetest they had?!   The decor and atmosphere felt very upscale and classy.  After giving a drink order you can get up and go to the \"salad bar\". So this salad bar is not merely a salad bar. It had various soups, meats, cheeses, and stuff that I couldn't even guess on what it was. I stuck with a romaine lettuce salad with ranch (can't go wrong there) and some deli meat, grilled provOlone, and crackers. All of which were very fresh and tasty.   After returning to the table, the meats start coming around. And they KEEP coming around. The meats were all very good but some were chewy and less tender than I'd expect from a place like this. The filet was absolutely delicious as was the garlic sirloin!  Also at times the waiters came by so quickly that there was no way you could have stopped them for the meat if you wanted to. This became frustrating as it could be a while before that meat came around again.   For dessert I ordered the cheesecake per our waiter's recommendation and OH MY GOODNESS. It was the best cheesecake I've ever had. Definitely recommend!  Overall this was a great experience and I will be coming back on special occasions!",

Of all the restaurants I've dine in Las Vegas this restaurant offers the best service! I can't count how many times our server refilled our glass and asked us how we were doing and if we had any other requests. Good job to the blonde lady server (sorry I forgot your name)! The meat here are out of this world! I highly recommend their filet mignon. Salad bar had a great selection and it tasted awesome! I left the restaurant beyond satisfied!",

    "text": "This is a protein lovers paradise. I reserved a table on trip advisor for a party of three, on a Tuesday night at 9 pm. The restaurant had a few people, but it wasn't overcrowded or noisy. The atmosphere was cozy and romantic. This wasn't a romantic occasion, but it had potential if that was what you were looking for. We started with the salad bar that had so many delicious choices that it could have been my dinner, but I had prepared for this experience, so I saved room for the MEAT. There were so many different kinds of protein that were brought to our table, I couldn't name all of them. I tried at least 6 different choices, if not more. The filet mignon was my favorite. The service was spot on. The dinner was $49.99 per person, not including drinks. I thought this was pretty reasonable for fine dining and the amount of food that was included. I would definitely visit this establishment again in the future.",

They have a bigger salad bar but that's it. It took forever to get meat and when they brought it by they piled it on my plate. By the time I ate one cut the othe cuts were cold. When I asked for one cut at a time they took forever to come back by. I guess they could blame it on the crowd but it really was due to being under staffed. All in all they did not make my favorites list and I'll probably never eat here again. $200 later and I'm still hungry. Hype?",

It clearly states you earn a $150 gift certificate for bringing at least 15 guests before a certain expiration date.  All criteria/terms were completely met.  When I signed the contract and paid my deposit, I observed the agreement states you earn a $50 gift certificate for each $500 spent. I pointed this out to the manager; he denied knowing what the promotional e-mail stated and could only go by the one-page contract.  The contract states your gift certificate will be mailed on the Monday following your event.  Not so.  Mine was mailed 22 days later than committed.  I'm going to enjoy my $100 gift certificate because I only spent $1200.00 that evening.  In fairness, I must say the food and especially the service was excellent!",

The wait for dinner was about an hour but it wasn't a big deal so just walked around town square for a bit to kill time. So if your in a rush make reservations. I love the salad bar and I think that was the best part for me. So many choices including soups like the lobster bisque which is a must try, olives, cheeses, cured meats, mushrooms and so much more. The meat choices were endless and I loved the top sirloin and everything that was bacon wrapped! Try everything that comes around even if you think your full. The service was good and the server even got us the bananas with condensed milk which wasn't on the menu and it was addicting. The bread with the cheese is also a must try but try not to get full on that.",

The lobster bisque is to die for.  there are so many items at the salad bar that I can't even begin to name them all, just know that the salad bar is excellent.    Now on to the meats!!  Filet mignon is tender and juicy, everything you imagine it to be.  Braised beef ribs are one of my favorite items here.  They are wonderfully flavorful, basting in its own juices.  Lamb chops are wonderful, tender, and juicy.  Barzilian sausage has a little bit of kick and great flavor.  Flank steak was another winner.  And the house special sirloin is definitely the star of the show.  That layer of fat bordering the succulent meat provides the perfect amount of flavor to the sirloin.  My mouth is watering just thinking about it.  The meat coma is totally worth it!!!",

Our waitress was very attentive for as much as she can do in her position but unfortunately it wasn't enough to save their dinner. ",

Flipped the card to GREEN and all the meats came one after the other. Remember don't forget to turn your card to RED! Which I did and let me tell you, we were stuffed at the end of the night. Finished the night up with Brazilian Cheesecake. It was delicious! I would have enjoyed it more if I wasn't so full. Food coma coming along.   Lesson of the day:  LISTEN to your server. They know it best!  Our server was Wesley. He was fantastic. He always asked if we were doing okay, if we needed anything, if there was a particular meat we wanted, and fixed our napkins. He was nice to have a server. We hope to be served by him again in the future. Thank you Wesley for making our first time in Texas De Brazil an awesome experience.",

I've been here many times and tried many Brazilian rodizio steakhouses in Vegas and Texas De Brazil ranks near the top.  Great salad bar selection which stays consistent for the most part as I always tend to chose the same sides but not too much since I'm all about the different meats they serve.  The meats are all flavorful and juicy but definitely require many glasses of water due to the salt element of cooking.  Must haves include the picanha, filet mignon, garlic steak, sausage, flank steak and beef ribs served only at dinner and cut from the slab which melts like butter to the cut.  Service is usually pretty good but I did run into one night of mediocre service where I had to tell the server a few times for one type of meat and it still never showed up so I just gave up and was too full anyways.  Place gets very busy so reservations highly recommended or go around 9 pm since they close at 10 pm.  Desserts are a must if you have room after the meal.",

    "text": "We came here to celebrate our one year engagement anniversary and even though it was a little pricey it was worth every penny!  Since it was a Monday there wasn't much of a wait.  By the time I returned from using the restroom our table was ready.  I didn't particularly like the seating as it was right behind the host station but for being seated that quickly (and being very hungry) I let it slide.  Next time I'll ask for a seat in the back. The only real negative I have us that the entry/exit doors are extremely heavy.  If that's the worst thing about a place in my book that's easily 5 stars.    We started out with the salad bar and a few of my favorite things were the goat cheese,  green beans and au gratin potatoes.  I also really enjoyed the potato salad which is not something I'm usually fond of.    The meats!  Oh the meats!  I tried chicken wrapped in bacon,  chicken parmesian, filet wrapped in bacon,  sirloin steak,  flank steak and sausage.  Everything was delicious.  The sausage has a slight kick to it which was a nice change of pace. The filet wrapped in bacon was a little on the salty side but that didn't stop me from finishing it.  The flank steak and sirloin steak were melt in your mouth delicious.  The chicken options were good but I'm more of a red meat person so they don't really stand out as I'm writing this.   We were stuffed full and asking for the check when our server Sue gave us comment cards and mentioned future discounts (of course we took the bait). I found this practice slightly odd for what seemed to be an upscale place.  I asked if we were able to get any discounts this time because we were celebrating our engagement anniversary and she offered us the cheesecake and even wrapped it to go for us.  The service was excellent,  the food was excellent because of the price this would be more of a special occasion restaurant but I do see us going back.",

The salad bar has enough delicious food to fill you up by itself and then those cheese bread things omg are soooo good. I t is pricey but worth EVERY penny! The service is really good too! I am looking for an excuse to go back already!",
